PREFACE

   To offer poetry for poetry's sake has been my first aim and leading
   principle in fulfilling the task with which the authorities of the
   Clarendon Press have honoured me. Hence it is probable that many poems
   which would be justly expected when the object of a selection is direct
   usefulness, spiritual aid and comfort, or (to put it in one word)
   edification, will here be found absent. And this deficiency, I fear,
   will be felt even by readers who are not satisfied with religious
   verse, however good its intention, unless it be clothed in the veil of
   beauty. For verse of this kind, hymns in particular, beyond any other
   modes of poetry, hold a special place in the hearts of men; so closely
   intertwined with the predilections of childhood, with the memories of
   the home or the church of our youth, with the voices no longer heard on
   this side the grave, that they have a charm for us beyond criticism,--a
   spell which is none the less irresistible because it is not cast over
   us by their own proper magic.

   Yet if my aim--an aim in collections of sacred song rarely avowed or
   followed--to present poetry for poetry's sake, has not here altogether
   been missed through my own want of taste or discernment, may it not be
   hoped that the final end and object of all the Fine Arts, and Poetry as
   the queen of them,--permanent pleasure, elevation and enlightenment of
   the soul,--to return to the word, edification in the highest
   sense,--will be secured more effectually and more enduringly, through
   the subtle, yet powerful aid of melody in words, and beauty in form? It
   is confessedly thus when Music or Painting are concerned; the better
   and finer the art, the more exquisite the pleasure, the more
   penetrating, the more vivifying, the impression. From this point of
   view, we may agree with the poet, 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty.' And
   so far from being alien or opposed to piety, these great gifts of God
   to man nowhere else have a more fitting place or a loftier function.
   Nowhere is the power and magic of poetry as an art more naturally in
   place or better employed than when her inspiring Muses are Faith, Hope,
   and Love,--when her subjects are those incomparably highest and most
   vital interests to mankind, which may be briefly summed up as right
   conduct here, and its reward hereafter.

   If, however, the rule of choice which I have tried to follow be
   theoretically valid, the argument has to be met, that by its very
   nature, through its general aim and its often imperfect quality as
   art,--Sacred Poetry rarely deserves the honour of that great name. And
   there is a large element of truth in this objection. The aim at direct
   usefulness to the individual or to the Church has unquestionably led to
   the neglect of Poetry in religious verse; and Art, we may truly say,
   has here revenged herself upon Religion. The most weighty of these
   adverse criticisms is the often-quoted verdict of Dr. Johnson.
   'Poetry,' he says, 'loses its lustre and its power, because it is
   applied to the decoration of something more excellent than itself. All
   that pious verse can do is to help the memory, and delight the ear, and
   for these purposes it may be very useful; but it supplies nothing to
   the mind. The ideas of Christian Theology are too simple for eloquence,
   too sacred for fiction, and too majestick for ornament.' Johnson is a
   judge whose native good sense, sincerity, and alertness of mind, render
   disregard of his decisions impossible without folly. Yet we cannot
   concede to him, in this matter, the infallibility which, (when that
   great debater had 'tossed and gored' his antagonists), he would
   laughingly disclaim for himself. His argument seems arbitrarily to
   confine the range and the capability of religious verse, as it will be
   found represented in this selection: and it is also a view coloured by
   the unalloyed seriousness--the gloom--of the great writer's own deeply
   felt religious faith; possibly, also, by the fact that he was writing
   at a period when our sacred song was wellnigh confined to hymns. And
   although with certain singular gifts as a critic of poetry, Johnson was
   not in advance of his day. Many of the poets who lived before the
   modern manner had established itself, he appears to have read or valued
   but little: with Habington or Herbert, for example, I am not aware that
   he shows any sympathetic acquaintance; while Vaughan, from his own time
   to ours, was almost wholly forgotten.

   It is however undeniable that if, (with some later critics), we
   inaccurately group all sacred verse under the single section of hymns
   in the popular sense of the word, the Religious lyric, in comparison
   with the Secular, (epithets which I use perforce in default of better),
   will be found largely inferior in poetical charm. But the argument in
   this form is sophistical. Secular verse covers many provinces; manners,
   incident, love, landscape,--the vast sphere of drama;--in a word, all
   the many-coloured romance of life. Sacred verse can hardly go beyond
   one province: to expect masterpieces in our field approximately
   numerous as those in the secular lyric is unreasonable. Even more
   unreasonable is it, when of this single province a district only is
   chosen out for censure, and treated as the whole domain. Hymns,
   wellnigh limited to the functions of prayer and of praise, are
   precisely that region in which a practical aim is naturally, almost
   inevitably predominant. The writers, (not to dwell upon the imperfect
   training of many among them), have hence far too frequently and easily
   made the sacrifice of pleasure to usefulness, of beauty to edification.
   But it should also be remembered that hymns, in this respect, are
   subject to the common penalty, the inferiority in art, inherent in all
   didactic verse; although with a more pressing and powerful excuse than
   didactic verse can offer for its inevitable prosaicism.

   Yet I hope that an answer, far more pleasant and convincing than any
   argument,--is offered to these objections by the following anthology.
   If indeed the limitations of its sphere be considered, the triteness of
   some inevitable motives, the insuperable loftiness of others, it seems
   to the Editor that English lyrical religious poetry fairly--perhaps
   fully--holds its own: that Urania has her legitimate throne beside her
   sister Muses of song. And should this opinion appear partial to my
   readers, let me plead that I have turned over many thousand pages in my
   search, as an excuse--if not a justification--for partiality.

   A few details remain for notice. Translations, as even when at the
   best, (by a law of nature, may I not call it?) hardly ever reaching
   excellence as poetry, or reaching it only for a moment, are here
   excluded. But paraphrases,--a style for centuries frequent in religious
   verse,--have been regarded as entitled to a measure of admission, when
   executed with such freedom and spirit, as to take rank with original
   inventions.

   A book planned for popular use half-defeats its own object by adherence
   to unfamiliar modes of spelling. But whilst in this respect modernizing
   the diction, I have carefully followed the best text easily
   accessible;--here, again, judging reference in every case to original
   editions not essential to the purpose of the volume. No verbal changes
   whatever have been made: but I have freely allowed such omissions as
   might appear to bring a poem to a closer unity in idea, or a more
   equably sustained excellence in poetry:--a freedom for which I shall
   hope forgiveness, at least from readers who accept the leading
   principle of the selection. And if the notes added upon obsolete words
   and phrases appear to any too numerous, I would plead that
   Poetry,--especially in this age of facile prose--requires every
   assistance to attract and hold her audience. Better that fifty should
   find an explanation superfluous, than one find a difficulty unsolved.

   Longer explanatory remarks have been reserved for the final notes: in
   which, also, (supported by the example of Archbishop Trench in his
   excellent Household Book of English Poetry), I have added a few
   indications of peculiar poetical merit. To separate a poet's serious
   work from his personality, as Goethe once remarked, is simply
   impossible. The brief biographies inserted, (which exclude our
   well-known master-singers, and those still living), will, therefore, it
   is hoped, satisfy, in a fair degree, the natural desire for some
   acquaintance with the lives of those whose best and deepest thoughts
   are here before us. Even when only a few bare facts have been recorded
   or noticed, they can hardly fail to throw over the verse some light and
   interest. But greater space has been given to those writers whose
   public career or personal modes of thought, (in particular when remote
   from present fashions), have given a special colour to their poetry.

   A chronological arrangement,--so far as chronology is possible, where
   the actual dates of composition are rarely known,--has been generally
   kept in view. But poems of cognate character, whether in style or in
   thought, have been often grouped together.


   Thanks are due to the unvaried kindness with which owners of copyright
   have conceded the privilege of reprinting. Amongst these it is proper
   to specify,--in case of Lord Tennyson, permission given by Messrs.
   Macmillan:--by Messrs. Parker and Messrs. Burns, for pieces from
   Keble's Miscellaneous Poems, and Father Faber's Hymns,
   respectively:--for Archbishop Trench and Mr. Barnes, from Messrs. K.
   Paul;--Mr. Lyte, Messrs. Rivingtons;--Dr. Bonar, Mr. J. Nisbet.

   The aim of this little book, let me repeat, is to offer such lyrical
   sacred song, and such only, as shall be instinctively felt worthy the
   august name of Poetry. And as I have also attempted to present here all
   such pieces known to me as reach a certain standard of excellence, a
   comparatively large space has been necessarily given to three or four
   poets who combined high genius with a considerable bulk of suitable
   work:--whilst the limits of size have compelled me to omit verse of
   simply moral quality, however pure and lofty, and thus intrinsically
   religious.

   It is, however, the inevitable--perhaps the unfortunate--lot of a
   selection framed upon these lines, that whether poetical merit or
   spiritual value be regarded, the selector's own personal tastes and
   opinions cannot be excluded; and in such matters it is difficult to
   keep perfectly true the balance of the soul. On the point of merit I
   can only plead an honest endeavour to shut out all mere individual
   predilections, and to form the decision by a wide and comparative
   research through this region of our literature during the last four
   centuries. But in reference to the different aspects of religion here
   presented, my task has been aided signally by the wide-embracing
   charity, the Catholic spirit (as embodied in the Creeds), natural to
   Poetry as part of her very essence. This has been well expressed by Mr.
   C. J. Abbey in his valuable essay upon the English Sacred Poetry of the
   eighteenth century. 'It may be said to be the peculiar privilege of
   hymn-writers that to a great extent they write, not for any one society
   of Christians, but for the Church at large. Men whose theological views
   contrast most strongly meet on common ground when they express in verse
   the deeper aspirations of the heart, and the voice of Christian
   praise.'--In a word, whilst severity has been aimed at, where Poetry as
   an art is concerned,--in regard to the religious quality of the verse
   selected, my rule has been that which Dante describes as given by S.
   Peter to the Angel at the gate of the Mount of Purgatory,

   YOUTH

   T. Lord Vaux


   When I look back, and in myself behold

   The wandering ways, that youth could not descry:

   And mark'd the fearful course that youth did hold,

   And met in mind each step youth stray'd awry;

   My knees I bow, and from my heart I call,

   O LORD, forget these faults and follies all!


   For now I see, how void youth is of skill,

   I see also his prime time and his end:

   I do confess my faults and all my ill,

   And sorrow sore, for that I did offend.

   And with a mind repentant of all crimes

   Pardon I ask for youth, ten thousand times.


   The humble heart hath daunted the proud mind;

   Eke wisdom hath given ignorance a fall:

   And wit hath taught, that [11] folly could not find,

   And age hath youth her subject and her thrall.

   Therefore I pray, O LORD of life and truth,

   Pardon the faults committed in my youth.


   Thou that didst grant the wise king his request:

   Thou that in Whale Thy prophet didst preserve:

   Thou that forgav'st the wounding of Thy breast:

   Thou that didst save the thief in state to sterve [12] :

   Thou only GOD, the giver of all grace:

   Wipe out of mind the path of youth's vain race.


   Thou that, by power, to life didst raise the dead:

   Thou that of grace restor'st the blind to sight:

   Thou that for love, Thy life and love out-bled:

   Thou that of favour mad'st the lame go right:

   Thou that canst heal, and help in all assays,

   Forgive the guilt, that grew in youth's vain ways.


   And now since I, with faith and doubtless mind,

   Do fly to Thee by prayer, to appease Thy ire:

   And since that Thee I only seek to find,

   And hope, by faith, to attain my just desire;

   LORD, mind no more youth's error and unskill,

   And able age to do Thy holy will.

   LIFE AND DEATH

   Anon.


   The pleasant years that seem, so swift that run:

   The merry days to end, so fast that fleet:

   The joyful nights, of which day dawns so soon:

   The happy hours, which mo [13] do miss, than meet,

   Do all consume, as snow against the sun:

   And death makes end of all, that life begun.


   Since death shall dure, till all the world be waste:

   What meaneth man to dread death then so sore?

   As man might make [14] , that life should alway last,

   Without regard [15] , the LORD hath led before

   The dance of death, which all must run on row:

   Though how, or when, the LORD alone doth know.


   If man would mind, what burdens life doth bring:

   What grievous crimes to GOD he doth commit:

   What plagues, what pangs, what perils thereby spring:

   With no sure hour in all his days to sit:

   He would sure think, as with great cause I do:

   The day of death were better of the two.


   Death is a port, whereby we pass to joy:

   Life is a lake, that drowneth all in pain:

   Death is so dear, it ceaseth all annoy:

   Life is so lewd [16] , that all it yields is vain.

   And as, by life, to bondage man is brought:

   E'en so likewise by death was freedom wrought.

   AN HYMN OF HEAVENLY LOVE

   E. Spenser


   Love, lift me up upon thy golden wings,

   From this base world unto thy heaven's height,

   Where I may see those admirable things

   Which there thou workest by thy sovereign might,

   Far above feeble reach of earthly sight,

   That I thereof an heavenly Hymn may sing

   Unto the GOD of Love, high heaven's King.


   Many lewd lays (ah! woe is me the more!)

   In praise of that mad fit which fools call love,

   I have in th' heat of youth made heretofore,

   That in light wits did loose affection move;

   But all those follies now I do reprove,

   And turnéd have the tenor of my string

   The heavenly praises of true love to sin.


   And ye that wont with greedy vain desire

   To read my fault, and, wondering at my flame,

   To warm yourselves at my wide sparkling fire,

   Sith now that heat is quenchéd, quench my blame,

   And in her ashes shroud my dying shame;

   For who my passéd follies now pursues,

   Begins his own, and my old fault renews.


   BEFORE THIS WORLD'S GREAT FRAME, in which all things

   Are now contain'd, found any being-place,

   Ere flitting Time could wag his eyas [17] wings

   About that mighty bound which doth embrace

   The rolling Spheres, and parts their hours by space,

   That High Eternal Power, which now doth move

   In all these things, moved in Itself by love.


   It loved Itself, because Itself was fair;

   (For fair is loved;) and of Itself begot,

   Like to Itself, His eldest Son and heir,

   Eternal, pure, and void of sinful blot,

   The firstling of His joy, in Whom no jot

   Of love's dislike or pride was to be found,

   Whom He therefore with equal honour crown'd.


   With Him he reign'd, before all time prescribed,

   In endless glory and immortal might,

   Together with that Third from Them derived,

   Most wise, most holy, most almighty Spright!

   Whose kingdom's throne no thought of earthly wight

   Can comprehend, much less my trembling verse

   With equal words can hope it to rehearse.


   Yet, O most blesséd Spirit! pure lamp of light,

   Eternal spring of grace and wisdom true,

   Vouchsafe to shed into my barren spright

   Some little drop of Thy celestial dew,

   That may my rhymes with sweet infuse imbrue [18] ,

   And give me words equal unto my thought,

   To tell the marvels by Thy mercy wrought.


   Yet being pregnant still with powerful grace,

   And full of fruitful love, that loves to get

   Things like Himself, and to enlarge His race,

   His second brood, though not in power so great,

   Yet full of beauty, next He did beget

   An infinite increase of Angels bright,

   All glistering glorious in their Maker's light.


   To them the heaven's illimitable height

   (Not this round heaven, which we from hence behold,

   Adorn'd with thousand lamps of burning light,

   And with ten thousand gems of shining gold,)

   He gave as their inheritance to hold,

   That they might serve Him in eternal bliss,

   And be partakers of those joys of His.


   There they in their trinal triplicities [19]

   About Him wait, and on His will depend,

   Either with nimble wings to cut the skies,

   When He them on his messages doth send,

   Or on His own dread presence to attend,

   Where they behold the glory of His light,

   And carol Hymns of love both day and night.


   Both day, and night, is unto them all one;

   For He His beams doth still to them extend,

   That darkness there appeareth never none;

   Ne hath their day, ne hath their bliss, an end,

   But there their termless time in pleasure spend;

   Ne ever should their happiness decay,

   Had not they dared their Lord to disobey.


   But pride, impatient of long resting peace,

   Did puff them up with greedy bold ambition,

   That they 'gan cast their state how to increase

   Above the fortune of their first condition,

   And sit in GOD's own seat without commission:

   The brightest Angel, ev'n the Child of Light,

   Drew millions more against their GOD to fight.


   Th' Almighty, seeing their so bold assay,

   Kindled the flame of His consuming ire,

   And with His only breath them blew away

   From heaven's height, to which they did aspire,

   To deepest hell, and lake of damnéd fire,

   Where they in darkness and dread horror dwell,

   Hating the happy light from which they fell.


   So that next offspring of the Maker's love,

   Next to Himself in glorious degree,

   Degendering [20] to hate, fell from above

   Through pride, (for pride and love may ill agree),

   And now of sin to all ensample be:

   How then can sinful flesh itself assure,

   Since purest Angels fell to be impure?


   But that Eternal Fount of love and grace,

   Still flowing forth His goodness unto all,

   Now seeing left a waste and empty place

   In His wide Palace, through those Angels' fall,

   Cast to supply the same, and to enstall

   A new unknowen Colony therein,

   Whose root from earth's base groundwork should begin.


   Therefore of clay, base, vile, and next to nought,

   Yet form'd by wondrous skill, and by His might,

   According to an heavenly pattern wrought,

   Which He had fashion'd in His wise foresight,

   He man did make, and breathed a living spright

   Into his face most beautiful and fair,

   Endued with wisdom's riches, heavenly, rare.


   Such He him made, that he resemble might

   Himself, as mortal thing immortal could;

   Him to be Lord of every living wight

   He made by love out of His own like mould,

   In whom He might His mighty Self behold;

   For Love doth love the thing beloved to see,

   That like itself in lovely shape may be.


   But man, forgetful of his Maker's grace

   No less than Angels whom he did ensue, [21]

   Fell from the hope of promised heavenly place,

   Into the mouth of death, to sinners due,

   And all his offspring into thraldom threw,

   Where they for ever should in bonds remain

   Of never-dead yet ever-dying pain;


   Till that great LORD of Love, which him at first

   Made of mere love, and after likéd well,

   Seeing him lie like creature long accurst

   In that deep horror of despairéd hell,

   Him, wretch, in dool [22] would let no longer dwell,

   But cast [23] out of that bondage to redeem,

   And pay the price, all were [24] his debt extreme.


   Out of the bosom of eternal bliss,

   In which He reignéd with His glorious Sire,

   He down descended, like a most demiss [25]

   And abject thrall, in flesh's frail attire,

   That He for him might pay sin's deadly hire,

   And him restore unto that happy state

   In which he stood before his hapless fate.


   In flesh at first the guilt committed was,

   Therefore in flesh it must be satisfied;

   Nor Spirit, nor Angel, though they man surpass,

   Could make amends to GOD for man's misguide [26] ,

   But only man himself, who self did slide:

   So, taking flesh of sacred Virgin's womb,

   For man's dear sake He did a man become.


   And that most blesséd Body, which was born

   Without all blemish or reproachful blame,

   He freely gave to be both rent and torn

   Of cruel hands, who with despiteful shame

   Reviling Him, that them most vile became [27] ,

   At length Him nailéd on a gallow-tree,

   And slew the Just by most unjust decree.


   O huge and most unspeakable impression

   Of love's deep wound, that pierced the piteous heart

   Of that dear LORD with so entire affection,

   And, sharply launching [28] every inner part,

   Dolours of death into His soul did dart,

   Doing Him die that never it deserved,

   To free His foes, that from His hest [29] had swerved!


   What heart can feel least touch of so sore launch,

   Or thought can think the depth of so dear wound?

   Whose bleeding source their streams yet never staunch,

   But still do flow, and freshly still redound [30] ,

   To heal the sores of sinful souls unsound,

   And cleanse the guilt of that infected crime

   Which was enrooted in all fleshly slime.


   O blesséd Well of Love! O Flower of Grace!

   O glorious Morning-Star! O Lamp of Light!

   Most lively image of Thy Father's face,

   Eternal King of Glory, LORD of Might,

   Meek Lamb of GOD, before all worlds behight [31] ,

   How can we Thee requite for all this good?

   Or what can prize [32] that Thy most precious blood?


   Yet nought Thou ask'st in lieu of all this love,

   But love of us, for guerdon of Thy pain:

   Ay me! what can us less than that behove? [33]

   Had He required life of us again,

   Had it been wrong to ask His own with gain?

   He gave us life, He it restoréd, lost;

   Then life were least, that us so little cost.


   But He our life hath left unto us free,

   Free that was thrall, and blesséd that was bann'd;

   Ne ought demands but that we loving be,

   As He Himself hath loved us afore-hand,

   And bound thereto with an eternal band,

   Him first to love that us so dearly bought,

   And next our brethren, to His image wrought.


   Him first to love great right and reason is,

   Who first to us our life and being gave,

   And after, when we faréd had amiss,

   Us wretches from the second death did save;

   And last, the food of life, which now we have,

   Even He Himself, in His dear Sacrament,

   To feed our hungry souls, unto us lent.


   Then next, to love our brethren, that were made

   Of that self mould, and that self Maker's hand,

   That we, [34] and to the same again shall fade,

   Where they shall have like heritage of land, [35]

   However here on higher steps we stand,

   Which also were with self-same price redeem'd

   That we, however of us light esteem'd.


   And were they not, yet since that loving LORD

   Commanded us to love them for His sake,

   Ev'n for His sake, and for His sacred word,

   Which in His last bequest He to us spake,

   We should them love, and with their needs partake;

   Knowing that, whatsoe'er to them we give,

   We give to Him by Whom we all do live.


   Such mercy He by His most holy rede [36]

   Unto us taught, and to approve it true,

   Ensampled it by His most righteous deed,

   Shewing us mercy, (miserable crew!)

   That we the like should to the wretches shew,

   And love our brethren; thereby to approve

   How much, Himself that lovéd us, we love.


   Then rouse thyself, O Earth! out of thy soil,

   In which thou wallowest like to filthy swine,

   And dost thy mind in dirty pleasures moyle, [37]

   Unmindful of that dearest LORD of thine;

   Lift up to Him thy heavy clouded eyne,

   That thou His sovereign bounty may'st behold,

   And read, through Love, His mercies manifold.


   Begin from first, where He encradled was

   In simple cratch, wrapt in a wad of hay,

   Between the toilful Ox and humble Ass,

   And in what rags, and in how base array,

   The glory of our heavenly riches lay,

   When Him the silly [38] Shepherds came to see,

   Whom greatest Princes sought on lowest knee.


   From thence read on the story of His life,

   His humble carriage, His unfaulty ways,

   His canker'd foes, His fights, His toil, His strife,

   His pains, His poverty, His sharp assays,

   Through which He past His miserable days,

   Offending none, and doing good to all,

   Yet being maliced [39] both of great and small.


   And look at last, how of most wretched wights

   He taken was, betray'd and false accused;

   How with most scornful taunts, and fell despites,

   He was reviled, disgraced, and foul abused;

   How scourged, how crown'd, how buffeted, how bruised;

   And lastly, how 'twixt robbers crucified,

   With bitter wounds through hands, through feet, and side!


   Then let thy flinty heart, that feels no pain,

   Empiercéd be with pitiful remorse,

   And let thy bowels bleed in every vein,

   At sight of His most sacred heavenly corse,

   So torn and mangled with malicious force;

   And let thy soul, whose sins His sorrows wrought,

   Melt into tears, and groan in grievéd thought.


   With sense whereof, whilst so thy soften'd spirit

   Is inly touch'd, and humbled with meek zeal

   Through meditation of His endless merit,

   Lift up thy mind to th' Author of thy weal,

   And to His sovereign mercy do appeal;

   Learn Him to love, that lovéd thee so dear,

   And in thy breast His blesséd image bear.


   With all thy heart, with all thy soul and mind,

   Thou must Him love and His behests embrace;

   All other loves, with which the world doth blind

   Weak fancies, and stir up affections base,

   Thou must renounce and utterly displace,

   And give thyself unto Him full and free,

   That full and freely gave Himself to thee.


   Then shalt thou feel thy spirit so possest,

   And ravish'd with devouring great desire

   Of His dear Self, that shall thy feeble breast

   Inflame with love, and set thee all on fire

   With burning zeal, through every part entire,

   That in no earthly thing thou shalt delight,

   But in His sweet and amiable sight.


   Thenceforth all world's desire will in thee die,

   And all earth's glory, on which men do gaze,

   Seem dirt and dross in thy pure-sighted eye,

   Compared to that Celestial Beauty's blaze,

   Whose glorious beams all fleshly sense doth daze

   With admiration of their passing light,

   Blinding the eyes, and lumining the spright.


   Then shall thy ravish'd soul inspired be,

   With heavenly thoughts far above human skill,

   And thy bright radiant eyes shall plainly see

   Th' Idea of His pure glory present still

   Before thy face, that all thy spirits shall fill

   With sweet enragement [40] of celestial Love,

   Kindled through sight of those fair things above.

   ETERNAL LOVE

   P. Sidney


   Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;

   And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;

   Grow rich in that which never taketh rust;

   Whatever fades, but fading pleasure brings.


   Draw in thy beams, and humble all thy might

   To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be;

   Which breaks the clouds, and opens forth the light,

   That doth both shine, and give us sight to see.


   O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide

   In this small course which birth draws out to death,

   And think how ill becometh him to slide,

   Who seeketh heaven, and comes of heavenly breath.


   Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:

   Eternal Love, maintain Thy life in me.

   SOUL AND BODY

   W. Shakespeare


   Poor Soul, the centre of my sinful earth,

   [Fool'd by] [41] these rebel powers that thee array,

   Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,

   Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?


   Why so large cost, having so short a lease,

   Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?

   Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,

   Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?


   Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,

   And let that pine to aggravate thy store;

   Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;

   Within be fed, without be rich no more:


   So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,

   And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

   A PRAYER

   H. Gifford


   O mighty GOD, Which for us men

   Didst suffer on the Cross

   The painful pangs of bitter death,

   To save our souls from loss,

   I yield Thee here most hearty thanks,

   In that Thou dost vouchsafe,

   Of me most vile and sinful wretch,

   So great regard to have.

   Alas, none ever had more cause

   To magnify Thy name,

   Than I, to whom Thy mercies shew'd

   Do witness well the same.

   So many brunts [42] of fretting foes

   Who ever could withstand,

   If Thou had'st not protected me,

   With Thy most holy hand?

   A thousand times in shameful sort

   My sinful life had ended,

   If by Thy gracious goodness, LORD,

   I had not been defended.

   In stinking pools of filthy vice

   So deeply was I drown'd,

   That none there was but Thee alone,

   To set my foot on ground.

   When as the fiend had led my soul

   E'en to the gates of hell,

   Thou call'dst me back, and dost me choose

   In heaven with Thee to dwell:--

   Let furies now fret on their fill,

   Let Satan rage, and roar,

   As long as Thou art on my side,

   What need I care for more?

   THE BIBLE

   Anon.


   Here is the spring where waters flow,

   To quench our heat of sin;

   Here is the tree where truth doth grow

   To lead our lives therein;

   Here is the judge that stints [43] the strife

   When men's devises fail:

   Here is the bread that feeds the life

   Which death cannot assail.

   The tidings of salvation dear

   Comes to our ears from hence;

   The fortress of our faith is here;

   The shield of our defence.

   Then be not like the hog that hath

   A pearl at his desire,

   And takes more pleasure in the trough

   And wallowing in the mire.

   Read not this book in any case

   But with a single eye:

   Read not, but first desire GOD's grace,

   To understand thereby.

   Pray still in faith with this respect

   To fructify therein;

   That knowledge may bring this effect,

   To mortify thy sin.

   Then happy thou in all thy life,

   Whatso to thee befalls;

   Yea, doubly happy shalt thou be

   When GOD by death thee calls.

   A CAROL

   E. Bolton


   Sweet Music, sweeter far

   Than any song is sweet:

   Sweet Music heavenly rare,

   Mine ears, (O peers [44] ) doth greet.

   Yon gentle flocks, whose fleeces, pearl'd with dew,

   Resemble heaven, whom golden drops make bright:

   Listen, O listen, now;--O not to you

   Our pipes make sport to shorten weary night:--

   But voices most divine

   Make blissful harmony:

   Voices that seem to shine,

   For what else clears the sky?

   Tunes can we hear, but not the singers see;

   The tunes divine, and so the singers be.


   Lo, how the firmament

   Within an azure fold

   The flock of stars hath pent,

   That we might them behold.

   Yet from their beams proceedeth not this light,

   Nor can their crystals such reflection give.

   What then doth make the element [45] so bright?

   The heavens are come down upon earth to live.

   But hearken to the song:

   Glory to glory's King,

   And peace all men among,

   These queristers do sing.

   Angels they are, as also (Shepherds) He,

   Whom in our fear we do admire to see.


   Let not amazement blind

   Your souls, (said he) annoy:

   To you and all mankind,

   My message bringeth joy.

   For lo! the world's great Shepherd now is born,

   A blesséd babe, an infant full of power:

   After long night, up-risen is the morn,

   Renowning Bethlem in the Savïour.

   Sprung is the perfect day,

   By prophets seen afar:

   Sprung is the mirthful May,

   Which Winter cannot mar.

   In David's city doth this Sun appear,

   Clouded in flesh;--yet, Shepherds! sit we here.

   THE BURNING BABE

   R. Southwell


   As I in hoary Winter's night stood shivering in the snow,

   Surprised I was with sudden heat, which made my heart to glow;

   And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,

   A pretty Babe all burning bright, did in the air appear;

   Who, scorchéd with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed,

   As though His floods should quench His flames which with His tears were
   fed;

   Alas! quoth He, but newly born, in fiery heats I fry [46] ,

   Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel My fire but I!

   My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns,

   Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns;

   The fuel Justice layeth on, and Mercy blows the coals;

   The metal in this furnace wrought are men's defiléd souls,

   For which, as now on fire I am, to work them to their good,

   So will I melt into a bath to wash them in My blood.

   --With this He vanish'd out of sight, and swiftly shrunk away,--

   And straight I calléd unto mind that it was Christmas-day.

   A CHILD MY CHOICE


   Let folly praise that [47] fancy loves, I praise and love that Child

   Whose heart no thought, Whose tongue no word, Whose hand no deed
   defiled.

   I praise Him most, I love Him best, all praise and love is His;

   While Him I love, in Him I live, and cannot live amiss.

   Love's sweetest mark, laud's highest theme, man's most desired light,

   To love Him life, to leave Him death, to live in Him delight.

   He mine by gift, I His by debt, thus each to other due,

   First friend He was, best friend He is, all times will try Him true.

   Though young, yet wise, though small, yet strong; though man, yet GOD
   He is;

   As wise He knows, as strong He can, as GOD He loves to bliss.

   His knowledge rules, His strength defends, His love doth cherish all;

   His birth our joy, His life our light, His death our end of thrall.

   Alas! He weeps, He sighs, He pants, yet do His angels sing;

   Out of His tears, His sighs and throbs, doth bud a joyful spring.

   Almighty Babe, Whose tender arms can force all foes to fly,

   Correct my faults, protect my life, direct me when I die!

   O THAT I HAD WINGS LIKE A DOVE

   Anon.


   O Gracious GOD, O Saviour sweet,

   O JESUS, think on me,

   And suffer me to kiss Thy feet,

   Though late I come to Thee.


   Behold, dear LORD, I come to Thee

   With sorrow and with shame,

   For when Thy bitter wounds I see,

   I know I caused the same.


   Sweet JESU, who shall lend me wings

   Of peace and perfect love,

   That I may rise from earthly things

   To rest with Thee above?


   For sin and sorrow overflow

   All earthly things so high,

   That I can find no rest below,

   But unto Thee I fly.


   Wherefore my soul doth loathe the things

   Which gave it once delight,

   And unto Thee, the King of kings,

   Would mount with all her might.


   And yet the weight of flesh and blood

   Doth so my wings restrain,

   That oft I strive and gain no good,

   But rise, to fall again.


   Yet when this fleshly misery

   Is master'd by the mind,

   I cry, 'avaunt, all vanity':

   And 'Satan, stand behind.'


   So thus, sweet LORD, I fly about

   In weak and weary case

   Like the lone dove which Noah sent [out],

   And found no resting place.


   My weary wings, sweet JESU, mark,

   And when Thou thinkest best

   Stretch forth Thy arm from out the ark,

   And take me to Thy rest.

   Heavenly Messias, (sweet anointed King,

   Whose glory round about the world doth reach,

   Which every beast, plant, rock, and river teach,

   And airy birds like Angels ever sing,


   And every gale of wind in gusts doth bring,

   And every man with reason ever preach),

   Behold, behold that lamentable breach,

   Which (my distresséd conscience to sting)


   False spiteful Satan in my soul doth make:

   Oh, (sweet Messias), lend some gracious oil

   To cure that wound, e'en for Thy mercy's sake:

   Lest (by that breach) Thy temple he despoil.


   Help, help; my conscience thither him doth lead;

   And he will come, if Thou bruise not his head.

   Who to the golden Sun's long restless race

   Can limits set? What vessel can comprise

   The swelling winds? what cunning can devise

   (With quaint Arithmetic) in steadfast place


   To number all the stars in heaven's paláce?

   What cunning Artist ever was so wise,

   Who, (by the stars and planets), could advise

   Of all adventures the just course and case?


   Who measured hath the waters of the seas?

   Who ever (in just balance) poised the air?

   As no man ever could the least of these

   Perform with human labour, strength and care,


   So who shall strive in volumes to contain

   GOD's praise ineffable, contends in vain.

   Triumphant conqueror of death and hell,

   Behold what legions (though in vain) conspire,

   Thy Temple militant to set on fire,

   And Saints which in Thy sanctuary dwell


   To burn, whilst they against Thy power rebel:

   See how like bloody tyrants they desire

   Ambitiously to rise, and mount up higher,

   Like Lucifer which to perdition fell.


   Their forces are addrest against Thy Saints,

   Break thou their bows, knap Thou their spears in sunder:

   I know their spirit at Thy presence faints,

   Against their Cannon plant Thy dreadful thunder,


   Thy thunderbolts against their bullets dash,

   And on their beavers [48] bright let lightning flash.

   Hierusalem, my happy home,

   When shall I come to thee?

   When shall my sorrows have an end,

   Thy joys when shall I see?


   O happy harbour of the Saints!

   O sweet and pleasant soil!

   In thee no sorrow may be found,

   No grief, no care, no toil.


   There lust and lucre cannot dwell,

   There envy bears no sway;

   There is no hunger, heat, nor cold,

   But pleasure every way.


   Thy walls are made of precious stones,

   Thy bulwarks diamonds square;

   Thy gates are of right orient pearl,

   Exceeding rich and rare.


   Thy turrets and thy pinnacles

   With carbuncles do shine;

   Thy very streets are paved with gold,

   Surpassing clear and fine.


   Ah, my sweet home, Hierusalem,

   Would GOD I were in thee!

   Would GOD my woes were at an end,

   Thy joys that I might see!


   Thy gardens and thy gallant walks

   Continually are green,

   There grows such sweet and pleasant flowers

   As nowhere else are seen.


   Quite through the streets, with silver sound,

   The flood of Life doth flow;

   Upon whose banks on every side

   The wood of Life doth grow.


   There trees for evermore bear fruit,

   And evermore do spring;

   There evermore the angels sit,

   And evermore do sing.


   Our Lady sings Magnificat

   With tones surpassing sweet;

   And all the virgins bear their part,

   Sitting about her feet.


   Hierusalem, my happy home,

   Would GOD I were in thee!

   Would GOD my woes were at an end,

   Thy joys that I might see!

   J. Donne


   Thou hast made me, and shall Thy work decay?

   Repair me now; for now mine end doth haste,

   I run to Death, and Death meets me as fast,

   And all my pleasures are like yesterday.


   I dare not move my dim eyes any way,

   Despair behind, and Death before doth cast

   Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste

   By sin in it, which it towards Hell doth weigh:


   Only Thou art above, and when towards Thee

   By Thy leave I can look, I rise again;

   But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,

   That not one hour myself I can sustain:


   Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,

   And Thou like adamant [49] draw mine iron heart.

   As due by many titles, I resign

   Myself to Thee, O GOD. First, I was made

   By Thee and for Thee, and when I was decay'd,

   Thy blood bought that the which before was Thine;


   I am Thy son, made with Thyself to shine,

   Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid,

   Thy sheep, Thine image, and, till I betray'd

   Myself, a temple of Thy Spirit divine.


   Why doth the devil, then, usurp on me?

   Why doth he steal, nay ravish that's Thy right?

   Except Thou rise, and for Thine own work fight,

   Oh, I shall soon despair, when I do see


   That Thou lov'st mankind well, yet will not choose me,

   And Satan hates me, yet is loth to loose me.

   At the round earth's imagined corners blow

   Your trumpets, Angels; and arise, arise

   From death, you numberless infinities

   Of souls, and to your scatter'd bodies go,


   All whom the Flood did, and Fire shall, o'erthrow;

   All whom Death, war, age, agues, tyrannies,

   Despair, law, chance hath slain; and you whose eyes

   Shall behold GOD, and never taste death's woe;--


   But let them sleep, LORD, and me mourn a space;

   For if above all those my sins abound,

   'Tis late to ask abundance of Thy grace,

   When we are there. Here on this lowly ground


   Teach me how to repent; for that's as good

   As if Thou'dst seal'd my pardon with my blood.

   A HYMN TO GOD THE FATHER


   Wilt Thou forgive that sin where I begun,

   Which was my sin, though it were done before?

   Wilt Thou forgive that sin, through which I run

   And do run still, though still I do deplore?

   When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done;

   For I have more.


   Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I have won

   Others to sin, and made my sins their door [50] ?

   Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I did shun

   A year or two, but wallow'd in, a score?

   When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done;

   For I have more.


   I have a sin of fear, that when I have [51] spun

   My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;

   But swear by Thyself, that at my death Thy Son

   Shall shine, as He shines now and heretofore:

   And having done that, Thou hast done;

   I fear no more.

   Lo, when back mine eye,

   Pilgrim-like I cast,

   What fearful ways I spy,

   Which, blinded, I securely past!


   But now heaven hath drawn

   From my brows that night;

   As when the day doth dawn,

   So clears my long-imprison'd sight.


   Straight the Caves of Hell

   Dress'd with flowers I see,

   Wherein False Pleasures dwell,

   That, winning most, most deadly be.


   Throngs of maskéd fiends,

   Wing'd like angels, fly;

   E'en in the gates of friends,

   In fair disguise black dangers lie.


   Straight to heaven I raised

   My restoréd sight,

   And with loud voice I praised

   The LORD of ever-during light.


   And since I had stray'd

   From His ways so wide,

   His grace I humbly pray'd

   Henceforth to be my guard and guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

   View me, LORD, a work of Thine!

   Shall I then lie drown'd in night?

   Might Thy grace in me but shine,

   I should seem made all of light.


   But my soul still surfeits so

   On the poison'd baits of sin,

   That I strange and ugly grow;

   All is dark and foul within.


   Cleanse me, LORD, that I may kneel

   At Thine altar, pure and white:

   They that once Thy mercies feel,

   Gaze no more on earth's delight.


   Worldly joys, like shadows, fade

   When the heavenly light appears;

   But the covenants Thou hast made,

   Endless, know nor days nor years.


   In Thy Word, LORD, is my trust,

   To Thy mercies fast I fly;

   Though I am but clay and dust,

   Yet Thy grace can lift me high!
     __________________________________________________________________

XXIII


   Seek the LORD, and in His ways perséver!

   O faint not, but as eagles fly,

   For His steep hill is high!

   Then striving gain the top and triumph ever!


   When with glory there thy brows are crownéd,

   New joys so shall abound in thee,

   Such sights thy soul shall see,

   That worldly thoughts shall by their beams be drownéd.


   Farewell, World, thou mass of mere confusion!

   False light, with many shadows dimm'd!

   Old witch, with new foils trimm'd!

   Thou deadly sleep of soul, and charm'd illusion!


   I the King will seek, of kings adoréd;

   Spring of light; tree of grace and bliss,

   Whose fruit so sovereign is

   That all who taste it are from death restoréd.
     __________________________________________________________________

   To music bent is my retired mind,

   And fain would I some song of pleasure sing;

   But in vain joys no comfort now I find;

   From heavenly thoughts all true delight doth spring:

   Thy power, O GOD, Thy mercies to record,

   Will sweeten every note and every word.


   All earthly pomp or beauty to express

   Is but to carve in snow, on waves to write;

   Celestial things, though men conceive them less,

   Yet fullest are they in themselves of light:

   Such beams they yield as know no means to die;

   Such heat they cast as lifts the spirit high.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Never weather-beaten sail more willing bent to shore,

   Never tired pilgrim's limbs affected slumber more,

   Than my wearied sprite now longs to fly out of my troubled breast.

   O come quickly, sweetest LORD, and take my soul to rest!


   Ever blooming are the joys of heaven's high Paradise,

   Cold age deafs not there our ears nor vapour dims our eyes:

   Glory there the sun outshines; whose beams the Blesséd only see.

   O come quickly, glorious LORD, and raise my sprite to Thee!

   Thy daily deeds thou try:

   He that one sin in conscience keeps

   When he to quiet goes,

   More vent'rous is than he that sleeps

   With twenty mortal foes!

   Anon.


   If I could shut the gate against my thoughts

   And keep out sorrow from this room within,

   Or memory could cancel all the notes

   Of my misdeeds, and I unthink my sin:

   How free, how clear, how clean my soul should lie,

   Discharged of such a loathsome company!


   Or were there other rooms without my heart

   That did not to my conscience join so near,

   Where I might lodge the thoughts of sin apart

   That I might not their clamorous crying hear,

   What peace, what joy, what ease should I possess,

   Freed from their horrors that my soul oppress!


   But, O my Saviour, Who my refuge art,

   Let Thy dear mercies stand 'twixt them and me,

   And be the wall to separate my heart

   So that I may at length repose me free;

   That peace, and joy, and rest may be within,

   And I remain divided from my sin.

   THE NATIVITY

   B. Jonson


   I sing the Birth was born to-night,

   The Author both of life and light;

   The angels so did sound it:--

   And like the ravish'd shepherds said,

   Who saw the light, and were afraid,

   Yet search'd, and true they found it.


   The Son of GOD, the eternal King,

   That did us all salvation bring,

   And freed the soul from danger;

   He whom the whole world could not take,

   The Word, which heaven and earth did make,

   Was now laid in a manger.


   What comfort by Him do we win,

   Who made Himself the price of sin,

   To make us heirs of glory!

   To see this Babe, all innocence,

   A martyr born in our defence!--

   Can man forget this story?

   Hear me, O GOD!

   A broken heart

   Is my best part:

   Use still Thy rod,

   That I may prove

   Therein Thy love.


   If Thou hadst not

   Been stern to me,

   But left me free,

   I had forgot

   Myself and Thee.


   For sin's so sweet,

   As minds ill bent

   Rarely repent,

   Until they meet

   Their punishment.

   DEATH'S LAST WILL

   W. Drummond


   More oft than once Death whisper'd in mine ear,

   Grave what thou hears in diämond and gold,

   I am that monarch whom all monarchs fear,

   Who hath in dust their far-stretch'd pride uproll'd;


   All, all is mine beneath moon's silver sphere,

   And nought, save virtue, can my power withhold:

   This, not believed, experience true thee told,

   By danger late when I to thee came near.


   As bugbear then my visage I did show,

   That of my horrors thou right use might'st make,

   And a more sacred path of living take:--

   Now still walk arméd for my ruthless blow:


   Trust flattering life no more, redeem time past,

   And live each day as if it were thy last.

   HYPOCRISY


   As are those apples, pleasant to the eye,

   But full of smoke within, which use to grow

   Near that strange lake, where GOD pour'd from the sky

   Huge showers of flames, worse flames to overthrow;


   Such are their works that with a glaring show

   Of humble holiness, in virtue's dye

   Would colour mischief, while within they glow

   With coals of sin, though none the smoke descry.


   Ill is that angel which erst fell from heaven,

   But not more ill than he, nor in worse case,

   Who hides a traitorous mind with smiling face,

   And with a dove's white feather masks a raven.


   Each sin some colour hath it to adorn;

   Hypocrisy, almighty GOD doth scorn.

   MAN'S KNOWLEDGE


   Beneath a sable veil and shadows deep

   Of unaccessible and dimming light,

   [18]In silence, ebon clouds more black than night,

   The world's great King His secrets hid doth keep:


   Through those thick mists, when any mortal wight

   Aspires, with halting pace and eyes that weep,

   To pore, and in His mysteries to creep,

   With thunders He and lightnings blasts their sight.


   O Sun invisible, that dost abide

   Within Thy bright abysms, most fair, most dark,

   Where with Thy proper rays Thou dost Thee hide!

   O ever-shining, never full-seen mark!


   To guide me in life's night Thy light me show;--

   The more I search, of Thee the less I know.

   SAINT JOHN BAPTIST


   The last and greatest Herald of heaven's King,

   Girt with rough skins, hies to the deserts wild,

   Among that savage brood the woods forth bring,

   Which he than man more harmless found and mild:


   His food was locusts, and what young doth spring,

   With honey that from virgin hives distill'd;

   Parch'd body, hollow eyes, some uncouth thing

   Made him appear, long since from earth exiled.


   There burst he forth: 'All ye, whose hopes rely

   On GOD, with me amidst these deserts mourn;

   Repent, repent, and from old errors turn.'

   Who listen'd to his voice, obey'd his cry?


   Only the echoes, which he made relent,

   Rung from their marble caves, 'Repent, repent!'

   URBS COELESTIS IERUSALEM


   Jerusalem, that place divine,

   The vision of sweet peace is named;

   In heaven her glorious turrets shine,

   Her walls of living stone are framed;

   While Angels guard her on each side,

   Fit company for such a bride.


   She, deck'd in new attire from heaven,

   Her wedding chamber, now descends,

   Prepared in marriage to be given

   To CHRIST, on Whom her joy depends.

   Her walls, wherewith she is enclosed,

   And streets are of pure gold composed.


   The gates adorn'd with pearls most bright

   The way to hidden glory show,

   And thither by the blesséd might

   Of faith in JESUS' merits go

   All those who are on earth distress'd,

   Because they have CHRIST's name profess'd.


   These stones the workmen dress and beat

   Before they throughly polish'd are;

   Then each is in his proper seat

   Establish'd by the Builder's care,

   In this fair frame to stand for ever,

   So join'd that them no force can sever.


   To GOD, Who sits in highest seat,

   Glory and power given be;

   To Father, Son, and Paraclete,

   Who reign in equal dignity;

   Whose boundless power we still adore,

   And sing Their praise for evermore.

   THE FAREWELL

   Anon.


   Methinks I draw but sickly breath:

   Who knows but I

   Before next night may sleeping lie,

   Rock'd in the arms of death?


   The swift-foot minutes pass away;

   For Time hath wings,

   That flag not for the breath of kings,

   Nor brook the least delay.


   And what a parcel of my sand

   Is yet to pass,

   Or what may break the crazy glass,

   How shall I understand?


   Then, base delights and dunghill joys!

   Farewell, adieu!

   While yet I live I'm dead to you,

   And such-like toys.


   I would not longer own a thought

   That crawls so low,

   Or lavish out my wishes so

   In quest of less than nought.


   My soul is wing'd with quick desires

   To pass the sky;

   Nothing below what is most high

   Allays those noble fires.


   LORD, as the kindling is from Thee,

   So Thine the breath

   That must continue it, till death

   Be dead and cease to be.

   My God, where is that ancient heat towards Thee

   Wherewith whole shoals of martyrs once did burn,

   Besides their other flames? Doth poetry

   Wear Venus' livery? only serve her turn?


   Why are not sonnets made of Thee? and lays

   Upon Thine altar burnt? Cannot Thy love

   Heighten a spirit to sound out Thy praise

   As well as any She? Cannot Thy Dove


   Outstrip their Cupid easily in flight?

   Or, since Thy ways are deep, and still the same,

   Will not a verse run smooth that bears Thy name?

   Why doth that fire, which by Thy power and might


   Each breast does feel, no braver fuel choose

   Than that, which one day worms may chance refuse?

   A TRUE HYMN


   My Joy, my Life, my Crown!

   My heart was meaning [52] all the day,

   Somewhat it fain would say,

   And still it runneth muttering up and down

   With only this, My Joy, my Life, my Crown!


   Yet slight not these few words;

   If truly said, they may take part

   Among the best in art:

   The fineness which a hymn or psalm affords

   Is, when the soul unto the lines accords.


   He who craves all the mind,

   And all the soul, and strength, and time,

   If the words only rhyme,

   Justly complains that somewhat is behind

   To make His verse, or write a hymn in kind.


   Whereas, if th' heart be moved,

   Although the verse be somewhat scant,

   GOD doth supply the want;

   As when th' heart says, sighing to be approved,

   O, could I love!' and stops,--GOD writeth, 'Loved.'

   LORD, with what care hast Thou begirt us round!

   Parents first season us; then schoolmasters

   Deliver us to laws; they send us bound

   To rules of reason, holy messengers,


   Pulpits and Sundays, sorrow dogging sin,

   Afflictions sorted, anguish of all sizes,

   Fine nets and stratagems to catch us in,

   Bibles laid open [53] , millions of surprises,


   Blessings beforehand, ties of gratefulness,

   The sound of glory ringing in our ears;

   Without, our shame; within, our consciences;

   Angels and grace, eternal hopes and fears:--


   Yet all these fences and their whole array

   One cunning bosom-sin blows quite away.

   While that my soul repairs to her devotion,

   Here I intomb my flesh, that it betimes

   May take acquaintance of this heap of dust;

   To which the blast of Death's incessant motion,

   Fed with the exhalation of our crimes,

   Drives all at last. Therefore I gladly trust


   My body to this school, that it may learn

   To spell his elements, and find his birth

   Written in dusty heraldry and lines:

   Which dissolution sure doth best discern,

   Comparing dust with dust, and earth with earth.

   These laugh at jet and marble, put for signs,


   To sever the good fellowship of dust,

   And spoil the meeting. What shall point out them

   When they shall bow, and kneel, and fall down flat

   To kiss those heaps, which now they have in trust?

   Dear flesh, while I do pray, learn here thy stem

   And true descent, that, when thou shalt grow fat,


   And wanton in thy cravings, thou may'st know,

   That flesh is but the glass which holds the dust

   That measures all our time; which also shall

   Be crumbled into dust. Mark here below

   How tame these ashes are, how free from lust--

   That thou mayst fit thyself against thy fall.

   The week were dark but for thy light;

   Thy torch doth show the way.


   Sundays the pillars are,

   On which Heaven's Palace archéd lies:

   The other days fill up the spare

   And hollow room with vanities:

   They are the fruitful beds and borders

   In GOD's rich garden: that [55] is bare

   Which parts their ranks and orders.


   The Sundays of man's life,

   Threaded together on Time's string,

   Make bracelets to adorn the Wife

   Of the eternal glorious King:

   On Sunday Heaven's gate stands ope;

   Blessings are plentiful and rife,

   More plentiful than hope.


   Thou art a day of mirth;

   And where the week-days trail on ground,

   Thy flight is higher, as thy birth:

   O let me take thee at the bound,

   Leaping with thee from seven to seven,

   Till that we both, being toss'd from Earth,

   All after pleasures as I rid one day,

   My horse and I, both tired, body and mind,

   With full cry of affections, quite astray;

   I took up in the next inn I could find.


   There when I came, Whom found I but my dear,

   My dearest LORD, expecting till the grief

   Of pleasures brought me to Him, ready there

   To be all passengers' most sweet relief.


   O Thou, Whose glorious yet contracted light,

   Wrapt in Night's mantle, stole into a manger;

   Since my dark soul and brutish, is Thy right,--

   To Man, of all beasts, be not Thou a stranger:


   Furnish and deck my soul, that Thou may'st have

   A better lodging than a rack or grave.

   AFFLICTION [56]


   When first Thou didst entice to Thee my heart,

   I thought the service brave

   So many joys I writ down for my part,

   Besides what I might have

   Out of my stock of natural delights,

   Augmented with Thy gracious benefits.


   What pleasures could I want, whose King I served,

   Where joys my fellows were?

   Thus argued into hopes, my thoughts reserved

   No place for grief or fear;

   Therefore my sudden soul caught at the place,

   And made her youth and fierceness seek Thy face.


   At first Thou gav'st me milk and sweetnesses;

   I had my wish and way;

   My days were strew'd with flowers and happiness;

   There was no month but May.

   But with my years sorrow did twist and grow,

   And made a party unawares for woe.


   [23]My flesh began unto my soul in pain,

   Sicknesses cleave my bones,

   Consuming agues dwell in every vein,

   And tune my breath to groans:

   Sorrow was all my soul; I scarce believed,

   Till grief did tell me roundly, that I lived.


   When I got health, Thou took'st away my life

   And more--for my friends die:

   My mirth and edge was lost, a blunted knife

   Was of more use than I:

   Thus, thin and lean, without a fence or friend,

   I was blown through with every storm and wind.


   Yet, lest perchance I should too happy be

   In my unhappiness,

   Turning my purge to food, Thou throwest me

   Into more sicknesses.

   Thus doth Thy power [24]cross-bias me, not making

   Thine own gift good, yet me from my ways taking.


   Now I am here, what Thou wilt do with me

   None of my books will show;

   I read, and sigh, and wish I were a tree--

   For sure, then, I should grow

   To fruit or shade; at least, some bird would trust

   Her household to me, and I should be just.


   Yet, though Thou troublest me, I must be meek;

   In weakness must be stout.

   Well, I will change the service, and go seek

   Some other master out,

   Ah, my dear GOD, though I am clean forgot,

   Let me not love Thee, if I love Thee not.

   DENIAL


   When my devotions could not pierce

   Thy silent ears,

   Then was my heart broken, as was my verse;

   My breast was full of fears

   And disorder;


   My bent thoughts, like a brittle bow,

   Did fly asunder;

   Each took his way; some would to pleasures go,

   Some to the wars and thunder

   Of alarms.


   As good go anywhere, they say,

   As to benumb

   Both knees and heart, in crying night and day,

   'Come, come, my GOD, O come!'

   But no hearing.


   O that Thou shouldst give dust a tongue

   To cry to Thee,

   And then not hear it crying! All day long

   My heart was in my knee,

   But no hearing.


   Therefore my soul lay out of sight,

   Untuned, unstrung;

   My feeble spirit, unable to look right,

   Like a nipt blossom, hung

   Discontented.


   O, cheer and tune my heartless breast,

   Defer no time;

   That so Thy favours granting my request,

   They and my soul may chime,

   And mend my rhyme.

   Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,

   Thy root is ever in its grave,

   And thou must die.


   Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,

   A box where sweets compacted lie,

   My music shows ye have your closes,

   And all must die.


   Only a sweet and virtuous soul,

   Like season'd timber, never gives [58] ;

   But though the whole world turn to coal,

   LORD, make me coy and tender to offend:

   I would not use a friend as I use Thee.


   If any touch my friend or his good name,

   It is my honour and my love to free

   His blasted fame

   From the least spot or thought of blame:

   I could not use a friend as I use Thee.


   My friend may spit upon my curious floor;

   Would he have gold? I lend it instantly;

   But let the poor,

   And Thou within them, starve at door--

   I cannot use a friend as I use Thee.


   When that my friend pretendeth to [59] a place,

   I quit my interest, and leave it free;

   But when Thy grace

   Sues for my heart, I Thee displace;

   Nor would I use a friend as I use Thee.


   Yet can a friend what Thou hast done fulfil?

   O, write in brass: 'My GOD upon a tree

   His blood did spill,

   Only to purchase my good will:'

   MORTIFICATION


   How soon doth man decay!

   When clothes are taken from a chest of sweets

   To swaddle infants, whose young breath

   Scarce knows the way,

   Those clouts are little winding-sheets,

   Which do consign and send them unto Death.


   When boys go first to bed,

   They step into their voluntary graves;

   Sleep binds them fast, only their breath

   Makes them not dead;

   Successive nights, like rolling waves,

   Convey them quickly who are bound for Death.


   When Youth is frank and free,

   And calls for music, while his veins do swell,

   All day exchanging mirth and breath

   In company,

   That music summons to the knell

   Which shall befriend him at the house of Death.


   When man grows staid and wise,

   Getting a house and home, where he may move

   Within the circle of his breath,

   Schooling his eyes;

   That dumb enclosure maketh love

   Unto the coffin that attends his death.


   When Age grows low and weak,

   Marking his grave, and thawing every year,

   Till all do melt, and drown his breath

   When he would speak,

   A chair or litter shows [60] the bier

   Which shall convey him to the house of Death.


   Man, ere he is aware,

   Hath put together a solemnity,

   And drest his hearse, while he has breath

   As yet to spare;

   Yet, LORD, instruct us so to die

   That all these dyings may be LIFE in DEATH.

   MISERY


   LORD, Let the angels praise Thy name;

   Man is a foolish thing, a foolish thing;

   Folly and sin play all his game;

   His house still burns; and yet he still doth sing:

   Man is but grass,

   He knows it; 'fill the glass.'


   They quarrel [61] Thee, and would give over

   The bargain made to serve Thee; but Thy love

   Holds them unto it, and doth cover

   Their follies with the wings of Thy mild Dove,

   Not suffering those

   Who would, to be Thy foes.


   Man cannot serve Thee: let him go

   And serve the swine--there, there is his delight:

   He doth not like this virtue, no;

   Give him his dirt to wallow in all night;

   'These preachers make

   His head to shoot and ache.'


   O foolish man! where are thine eyes?

   How hast thou lost them in a crowd of cares!

   Thou pull'st the rug [62] , and wilt not rise,

   No, not to purchase the whole pack of stars:

   'There let them shine,

   Thou must go sleep, or dine.'


   The bird that sees a dainty bower

   Made in the tree where she was wont to sit,

   Wonders and sings, but not His power

   Who made the arbour: this exceeds her wit.

   But Man doth know

   The spring whence all things flow:


   And yet, as though he knew it not,

   His knowledge winks, and lets his humours reign;

   They make his life a constant blot,

   And all the blood of GOD to run in vain.

   Then Money came, and chinking still,

   'What tune is this, poor man?' said he;

   'I heard in music you had skill:'

   But Thou shalt answer, LORD, for me.


   Then came brave Glory puffing by

   In silks that whistled, who but he!

   He scarce allow'd me half an eye:

   But Thou shalt answer, LORD, for me.


   Then came quick Wit and Conversation,

   And he would needs a comfort be,

   And, to be short, make an oration:

   Who above all things loved this life;

   To whom thy scythe a hatchet was,

   A hollow wind did seem to answer, 'No;

   Go seek elsewhere.'


   I did; and going did a rainbow note:

   Surely, thought I,

   This is the lace of Peace's coat:

   I will search out the matter.

   But while I look'd, the clouds immediately

   Did break and scatter.


   Then went I to a garden, and did spy

   A gallant flower,--

   The Crown Imperial. Sure, said I,

   Peace at the root must dwell.

   But when I digg'd, I saw a worm devour

   What show'd so well.


   At length I met a reverend good old man;

   Whom when for Peace

   I did demand, he thus began:

   'There was a Prince of old

   At Salem dwelt, Who lived with good increase

   Of flock and fold.


   'He sweetly lived; yet sweetness did not save

   His life from foes.

   But after death out of His grave

   There sprang twelve stalks of wheat;

   Which many wondering at, got some of those

   To plant and set.


   'It prosper'd strangely, and did soon disperse

   Through all the earth;

   For they that taste it do rehearse

   That virtue lies therein:

   A secret virtue, bringing peace and mirth

   By flight of sin.


   'Take of this grain, which in my garden grows,

   And grows for you:

   Make bread of it; and that repose

   And peace, which everywhere

   With so much earnestness you do pursue,

   Is only there.'

   MAN'S MEDLEY


   Hark how the birds do sing

   And woods do ring:

   All creatures have their joy, and man hath his.

   Yet if we rightly measure,

   Man's joy and pleasure

   Rather hereafter than in present is.


   To this life things of sense

   Make their pretence;

   In the other Angels have a right by birth:

   Man ties them both alone,

   And makes them one,

   With the one hand touching Heaven, with the other earth.


   Not that he may not here

   Taste of the cheer;

   But as birds drink, and straight lift up their head,

   So must he sip, and think

   Of better drink

   He may attain to after he is dead.


   But as his joys are double,

   So is his trouble:

   He hath two winters, other things but one;

   Both frosts and thoughts do nip

   And bite his lip;

   And he of all things fears two deaths alone.


   Yet ev'n the greatest griefs

   May be reliefs,

   Could he but take them right and in their ways.

   Happy is he whose heart

   Hath found the art

   To turn his double pains to double praise!

   VANITY


   The fleet astronomer can bore

   And thread the spheres with his quick-piercing mind;

   He views their stations, walks from door to door,

   Surveys, as if he had design'd

   To make a purchase there; he sees their dances,

   And knoweth long before

   Both their full-eyed [27]aspects [65] and secret glances.


   The nimble diver with his side

   Cuts through the working waves, that he may fetch

   His dearly-earnéd pearl; which GOD did hide

   On purpose from the venturous wretch,

   That He might save his life, and also hers

   Who with excessive pride

   Her own destruction and his danger wears.


   The subtle chymick can divest

   And strip the creature naked, till he find

   The [28]callow principles [66] within their nest:

   There he imparts to them his mind,

   Admitted to their bed-chamber, before

   They appear trim and drest

   To ordinary suitors at the door.


   What hath not man sought out and found,

   But his dear GOD? Who yet His glorious law

   Embosoms in us, mellowing the ground

   With showers and frosts, with love and awe;

   So that we need not say, Where's this command?

   --Poor man, thou searchest round

   To find out death, but missest life at hand!

   THE PILGRIMAGE


   I travell'd on, seeing the hill, where lay

   My expectation.

   A long it was and weary way:

   The gloomy cave of Desperation

   I left on the one, and on the other side

   The rock of Pride.


   And so I came to Fancy's meadow, strow'd

   With many a flower:

   Fain would I here have made abode,

   But I was quicken'd by my hour.

   So to Care's copse I came, and there got through

   With much ado.


   That led me to the wild of Passion, which

   Some call the wold;

   A wasted place, but sometimes rich.

   Here I was robb'd of all my gold,

   Save one good angel [67] , which a friend had tied

   Close to my side.


   At length I got unto the gladsome hill,

   Where lay my hope,

   Where lay my heart; and climbing still,

   When I had gain'd the brow and top,

   A lake of brackish waters on the ground

   Was all I found.


   With that abash'd and struck with many a sting

   Of swarming fears,

   I fell and cried, 'Alas, my King,

   Can both the way and end be tears?'

   Yet taking heart, I rose, and then perceived

   I was deceived.


   My hill was further: so I flung away,

   Yet heard a cry

   Just as I went, 'None goes that way

   And lives.' 'If that be all,' said I,

   After so foul a journey death is fair,

   And but a chair [68] .'

   PRAISE


   King of glory, King of peace,

   I will love Thee;

   And that love may never cease,

   I will move Thee.


   Thou hast granted my request,

   Thou hast heard me;

   Thou didst note my working breast,

   Thou hast spared me.


   Wherefore with my utmost art

   I will sing Thee,

   And the cream of all my heart

   I will bring Thee.


   Though my sins against me cried,

   Thou didst clear me;

   And alone, when they replied,

   Thou didst hear me.


   Seven whole days, not one in seven,

   I will praise Thee;

   In my heart, though not in Heaven,

   I can raise Thee.


   Thou grew'st soft and moist with tears,

   Thou relentedst,

   And when Justice call'd for fears,

   Thou dissentedst.


   Small it is, in this poor sort

   To enrol Thee;

   E'en eternity is too short

   To extol Thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   LONGING


   With sick and famish'd eyes,

   With doubling knees, and weary bones,

   To Thee my cries,

   To Thee my groans,

   To Thee my sighs, my tears ascend:

   No end?


   My throat, my soul is hoarse;

   My heart is wither'd like a ground

   Which Thou dost curse;

   My thoughts turn round,

   And make me giddy: LORD, I fall,

   Yet call.


   Bowels of pity, hear;

   LORD of my soul, love of my mind,

   Bow down Thine ear;

   Let not the wind

   Scatter my words, and in the same

   Thy name.


   Look on my sorrows round;

   Mark well my furnace. O, what flames,

   What heats abound!

   What griefs, what shames!

   Consider, LORD; LORD, bow thine ear,

   And hear!


   LORD JESU, Thou didst bow

   Thy dying head upon the tree;

   O, be not now

   More dead to me.

   LORD, hear. Shall He that made the ear

   Not hear?


   To Thee help appertains:

   Hast Thou left all things to their course,

   And laid the reins

   Upon the horse?

   Is all lock'd? hath a sinner's plea

   No key?


   Thou tarriest, while I die,

   And fall to nothing: Thou dost reign,

   And rule on high,

   While I remain

   In bitter grief; yet am I styled

   Thy child.


   My Love, my Sweetness, hear:

   By these Thy feet, at which my heart

   Lies all the year,

   Pluck out Thy dart,

   And heal my troubled breast, which cries,

   Which dies.

   THE BAG


   Away despair! my gracious LORD doth hear;

   Though winds and waves assault my keel,

   He doth preserve it; He doth steer,

   Ev'n when the boat seems most to reel.

   Storms are the triumph of His art;

   Well may He close His eyes, but not His heart.


   Hast thou not heard that my LORD JESUS died?

   Then let me tell thee a strange story:

   The GOD of power, as He did ride

   In His majestic robes of glory,

   Resolved to 'light, and so one day

   He did descend, undressing all the way.


   The stars His tire of light and rings obtain'd,

   The cloud His bow, the fire His spear,

   The sky His azure mantle gain'd;

   And when they ask'd what He would wear,

   He smiled, and said as He did go,

   He had new clothes a-making here below.


   When He was come, as travellers are wont,

   He did repair unto an inn.

   Both then, and after, many a brunt

   He did endure to cancel sin;

   And having given the rest before,

   Here He gave up His life to pay our score.


   But as He was returning, there came one

   That ran upon Him with a spear.

   He, who came hither all alone,

   Bringing nor man, nor arms, nor fear,

   Received the blow upon His side,

   And straight He turn'd, and to His brethren cried,


   'If ye have anything to send or write--

   I have no bag, but here is room--

   Unto My Father's hands and sight,

   Believe Me, it shall safely come.

   That I shall mind what you impart,

   Look, you may put it very near my heart.


   'Or if hereafter any of My friends

   Will use Me in this kind, the door

   Shall still be open; what he sends

   I will present, and somewhat more,

   Not to his hurt: sighs will convey

   Anything to Me.' Hark, Despair, away!
     __________________________________________________________________

   THE PULLEY


   When GOD at first made Man,

   Having a glass of blessings standing by,

   'Let us,' said He, 'pour on him all we can;

   Let the world's riches, which disperséd lie,

   Contract into a span.'


   So strength first made a way;

   Then beauty flow'd, then wisdom, honour, pleasure:

   When almost all was out, GOD made a stay,

   Perceiving that, alone of all His treasure,

   Rest in the bottom lay.


   'For if I should,' said He,

   'Bestow this jewel also on My creature,

   He would adore My gifts instead of Me,

   And rest in Nature, not the GOD of Nature;

   So both should losers be.


   'Yet let him keep the rest,

   But keep them with repining restlessness;

   Let him be rich and weary, that at least,

   If goodness lead him not, yet weariness

   May toss him to My breast.'

   THE FLOWER

   See [30]Note


   How fresh, O LORD, how sweet and clean

   Are Thy returns! e'en as the flowers in Spring

   To which, besides their own [31]demesne,

   The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring;

   Grief melts away

   Like snow in May,

   As if there were no such cold thing.


   Who would have thought my shrivell'd heart

   Could have recover'd greenness? It was gone

   Quite underground; as flowers depart

   To see their mother-root, when they have blown,

   Where they together

   All the hard weather,

   Dead to the world, keep house unknown.


   These are Thy wonders, LORD of power,

   Killing and quickening, bringing down to Hell

   And up to Heaven in an hour;

   Making a [32]chiming of a passing bell.

   We say amiss,

   This or that is;

   Thy Word is all, if we could spell.


   O that I once past changing were,

   Fast in Thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!

   Many a Spring I shoot up fair,

   [33]Offering at Heaven, growing and groaning thither;

   Nor doth my flower

   Want a Spring-shower,

   My sins and I joining together.


   But while I grow in a straight line,

   Still upwards bent, as if Heaven were mine own,

   Thy anger comes, and I decline:

   What frost to that? what pole is not the zone

   Where all things burn,

   When Thou dost turn,

   And the least frown of Thine is shown?


   And now in age I bud again,

   After so many deaths I live and write;

   I once more smell the dew and rain,

   And relish versing: O my only Light,

   It cannot be

   That I am he

   On whom Thy tempests fell all night.


   These are Thy wonders, LORD of love,

   To make us see we are but flowers that glide;

   Which when we once can find and prove,

   Thou hast a garden for us where to bide.--

   Who would be more,

   [34]Swelling through store,

   Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.

   THE GLANCE


   When first Thy sweet and gracious eye

   Vouchsafed, e'en in the midst of youth and night,

   To look upon me, who before did lie

   Weltering in sin,

   I felt a sugar'd strange delight,

   Passing all cordials made by any art,

   Bedew, embalm, and overrun my heart,

   And take it in.


   Since that time many a bitter storm

   My soul hath felt, ev'n able to destroy,

   Had the malicious and ill-meaning harm

   His swing and sway;

   But still Thy sweet original joy

   Sprung from Thine eye, did work within my soul,

   And surging griefs, when they grew bold, control,

   And got the day.


   If Thy first glance so powerful be--

   A mirth [69] but open'd, and seal'd up again--

   What wonders shall we feel when we shall see

   Thy full-eyed love!

   When Thou shalt look us out of pain,

   And one aspect of Thine spend in delight

   More than a thousand suns disburse in light,

   In Heaven above!

   THE FOIL


   If we could see below

   The sphere of Virtue and each shining grace,

   As plainly as that above doth show,

   This were the better sky, the brighter place.


   GOD hath made stars the foil

   To set-off virtues, griefs to set-off sinning;

   Yet in this wretched world we toil,

   As if grief were not foul, nor virtue winning.

   THE POSY


   Let wits contest,

   And with their words and posies windows fill;

   'Less than the least

   Of all Thy mercies,' is my posy still.


   This on my ring,

   This by my picture, in my book I write;

   Whether I sing,

   Or say, or dictate, this is my delight.


   Invention, rest;

   Comparisons, go play; wit, use thy will;

   'Less than the least

   Of all GOD's mercies' is my posy still.
     __________________________________________________________________

   A WREATH


   A wreathéd garland of deservéd praise,

   Of praise deservéd, unto Thee I give,

   I give to Thee, Who knowest all my ways,

   My crookéd winding ways, wherein I live--


   Wherein I die, not live; for life is straight,

   Straight as a line, and ever tends to Thee--

   To Thee, Who art more far above deceit,

   Than deceit seems above simplicity.


   Give me simplicity, that I may live;

   So live and like, that I may know Thy ways;

   Know them and practise them; then shall I give,

   For this poor wreath, give Thee a crown of praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

LXVI

   DISCIPLINE


   Throw away Thy rod,

   Throw away Thy wrath;

   O my GOD,

   Take the gentle path.


   For my heart's desire

   Unto Thine is bent;

   I aspire

   To a full consent.


   Though I fail, I weep;

   Though I halt in pace,

   Yet I creep

   To the throne of grace.


   Then let wrath remove;

   Love will do the deed;

   For with love

   Stony hearts will bleed.


   Love is swift of foot;

   Love's a man of war,

   And can shoot,

   And can hit from far.


   Who can 'scape his bow?

   That which wrought on Thee,

   Brought Thee low,

   Needs must work on me.


   Throw away Thy rod:

   Though man frailties hath,

   Thou art GOD;

   Throw away Thy wrath.

   Teach me, my GOD and King,

   In all things Thee to see,

   And what I do in anything,

   To do it as for Thee.


   All may of Thee partake:

   Nothing can be so mean

   Which with his tincture [70] , For Thy sake,

   Will not grow bright and clean.


   A servant with this clause

   Makes drudgery divine;

   Who sweeps a room as for Thy laws,

   Makes that and the action fine.


   This is the famous stone

   That turneth all to gold;

   For that which GOD doth touch and own

   Cannot for less be told [71] .

   DEATH


   Death, thou wast once an uncouth hideous thing,

   Nothing but bones,

   The sad effect of sadder groans:

   Thy mouth was open, but thou couldst not sing.


   For we consider'd thee as at some six

   Or ten years hence,

   After the loss of life and sense;

   Flesh being turn'd to dust, and bones to sticks.


   We look'd on this side of thee, shooting short,

   Where we did find

   The shells of fledge-souls left behind;

   Dry dust, which sheds no tears, but may extort.


   But since our Saviour's death did put some blood

   Into thy face,

   Thou art grown fair and full of grace,

   Much in request, much sought for, as a good.


   For we do now behold thee gay and glad,

   As at doomsday,

   When souls shall wear their new array,

   And all thy bones with beauty shall be clad.


   Therefore we can go die as sleep, and trust

   Half that we have

   Unto an honest faithful grave,

   Making our pillows either down, or dust.
     __________________________________________________________________

LXIX

   LOVE


   Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back,

   Guilty of dust and sin.

   But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack

   From my first entrance in,

   Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,

   If I lack'd anything.


   'A guest,' I answer'd, 'worthy to be here:'

   Love said, 'You shall be he.'

   'I, the unkind, ungrateful? Ah, my dear,

   I cannot look on Thee.'

   Love took my hand, and smiling, did reply,

   'Who made the eyes but I?'


   'Truth, LORD, but I have marr'd them; let my shame

   Go where it doth deserve.'

   'And know you not,' says Love, 'who bore the blame?'

   'My dear, then I will serve.'

   You must sit down,' says Love, 'and taste my meat.'

   So I did sit and eat.

   A great affliction broke the little frame,

   Ev'n all to pieces; which I went to seek:

   And first I found the corner where was I,

   After, where ES, and next where U was graved.

   When I had got these parcels, instantly

   I sat me down to spell them, and perceived

   That to my broken heart He was I ease you,

   And to my whole is IESU.

   COMFORT IN EXTREMITY

   Alas! my LORD is going,

   Oh my woe!

   It will be mine undoing;

   If He go,

   I'll run and overtake Him;

   If He stay,

   I'll cry aloud, and make Him

   Look this way.

   O stay, my LORD, my Love, 'tis I;

   Comfort me quickly, or I die.


   'Cheer up thy drooping spirits;

   I am here.

   Mine all-sufficient merits

   Shall appear

   Before the throne of glory

   In thy stead:

   I'll put into thy story

   What I did.

   Lift up thine eyes, sad soul, and see

   Thy Saviour here. Lo, I am He.'


   Alas! shall I present

   My sinfulness

   To Thee? Thou wilt resent

   The loathsomeness.

   'Be not afraid, I'll take

   Thy sins on Me,

   And all My favour make

   To shine on thee.'

   LORD, what Thou'lt have me, Thou must make me.

   'As I have made thee now, I take thee.'

   What am I who dare call Thee, GOD!

   And raise my fancy to discourse Thy power?

   To whom dust is the period,

   Who am not sure to farm [72] this very hour?

   For how know I the latest sand

   In my frail glass of life, doth not now fall?

   And while I thus astonish'd stand

   I but prepare for my own funeral?

   Death doth with man no order keep:

   It reckons not by the expense [73] of years,

   But makes the Queen and beggar weep,

   And ne'er distinguishes between their tears.

   He who the victory doth gain

   Falls as he him pursues, who from him flies,

   And is by too good fortune slain:

   The lover in his amorous courtship dies:

   The statesman suddenly expires

   While he for others ruin doth prepare:

   And the gay Lady while she admires

   Her pride, and curls in wanton nets her hair.

   No state of man is fortified

   'Gainst the assault of th' universal doom:

   But who the Almighty fear, deride

   Pale Death, and meet with triumph in the tomb.

   LAUDATE DOMINUM DE CAELIS


   You Spirits! who have thrown away

   That envious weight of clay,

   Which your celestial flight denied:

   Who by your glorious troops supply

   The wingéd Hierarchy,

   So broken in the Angels' pride!


   O you! whom your Creator's sight

   Inebriates with delight!

   Sing forth the triumphs of His name

   All you enamour'd souls! agree

   In a loud symphony,

   To give expressions to your flame!


   To Him, His own great works relate,

   Who deign'd to elevate

   You 'bove the frailty of your birth:

   Where you stand safe from that rude war,

   With which we troubled are

   By the rebellion of our earth.


   While a corrupted air beneath

   Here in this world we breathe,

   Each hour some passion us assails:

   Now lust casts wild-fire in the blood,

   Or that it may seem good,

   Itself in wit or beauty veils.


   Then envy circles us with hate,

   And lays a siege so streight,

   No heavenly succour enters in:

   But if revenge admittance find,

   For ever hath the mind

   Made forfeit of itself to sin.


   Assaulted thus, how dare we raise

   Our minds to think His praise,

   Who is eternal and immense?

   How dare we force our feeble wit

   To speak Him infinite,

   So far above the search of sense?


   O you! who are immaculate

   His name may celebrate

   In your soul's bright expansión:

   You whom your virtues did unite

   To His perpetual light,

   That even with Him you now shine one.

   RECOGITABO TIBI OMNES ANNOS MEOS


   Time! where didst thou those years inter

   Which I have seen decease?

   My soul's at war, and truth bids her

   Find out their hidden sepulchre,

   To give her troubles peace.


   Pregnant with flowers doth not the Spring

   Like a late bride appear?

   Whose feather'd music [74] only bring

   Caresses, and no requiem sing

   On the departed year?


   The Earth, like some rich wanton heir

   Whose parents coffin'd lie,

   Forgets it once look'd pale and bare,

   And doth for vanities prepare,

   As the Spring ne'er should die.


   The present hour, flatter'd by all,

   Reflects not on the last;

   But I, like a sad factor [75] , shall

   To account my life each moment call,

   And only weep the past.


   My memory tracks each several way

   Since reason did begin

   Over my actions her first sway:

   And teacheth me that each new day

   Did only vary sin.


   Poor bankrupt Conscience! where are those

   Rich hours but farm'd to thee?

   How carelessly I some did lose,

   And other to my lust dispose,

   As no rent-day should be!


   I have infected with impure

   Disorders my first years.

   But I'll to penitence inure

   Those that succeed. There is no cure

   Nor antidote but tears.

   NOX NOCTI INDICAT SCIENTIAM


   When I survey the bright

   Celestial sphere;

   So rich with jewels hung, that Night

   Doth like an Ethiop bride appear;


   My soul her wings doth spread

   And heaven-ward flies,

   The Almighty's mysteries to read

   In the large volumes of the skies.


   For the bright firmament

   Shoots forth no flame

   So silent, but is eloquent

   In speaking the Creator's name.


   No unregarded star

   Contracts its light

   Into so small a character,

   Removed far from our human sight,


   But if we steadfast look

   We shall discern

   In it, as in some holy book,

   How man may heavenly knowledge learn.


   It tells the conqueror,

   That far-stretch'd power,

   Which his proud dangers traffic for,

   Is but the triumph of an hour:


   That from the farthest North,

   Some nation may,

   Yet undiscover'd, issue forth,

   And o'er his new-got conquest sway:


   Some nation yet shut in

   With hills of ice

   May be let out to scourge his sin,

   Till they shall equal him in vice.


   And then they likewise shall

   Their ruin have;

   For as yourselves your empires fall,

   And every kingdom hath a grave.


   Thus those celestial fires,

   Though seeming mute,

   The fallacy of our desires

   And all the pride of life confute:--


   For they have watch'd since first

   The World had birth:

   And found sin in itself accurst,

   And nothing permanent on Earth.

   Show me more love, my dearest LORD;

   Oh turn away Thy clouded face,

   Give me some secret look or word

   That may betoken love and grace;

   No day or time is black to me

   But that wherein I see not Thee.

   Show me more love: a clouded face

   Strikes deeper than an angry blow;

   Love me and kill me by Thy grace,

   I shall not much bewail my woe.

   But even to be

   In heaven unloved of Thee,

   Were hell in heaven for to see.

   Then hear my cry and help afford:

   Show me more love, my dearest LORD!


   Show me more love, my dearest LORD,--

   I cannot think, nor speak, nor pray;

   Thy work stands still, my strength is stored

   In Thee alone. Oh come away,

   Show me Thy beauties, call them mine,

   My heart and tongue will soon be Thine.

   Show me more love; or if my heart

   Too common be for such a guest,

   Let Thy good Spirit, by Its art,

   Make entry and put out the rest;

   For 'tis Thy nest.

   Then he's of heaven possest,

   That heaven hath in his breast.

   Then hear my cry, and help afford;

   Show me more love, my dearest LORD!

   THE INVITATION

   LORD, what unvalued pleasures crown'd

   The days of old;

   When Thou wert so familiar found,

   Those days were gold;--


   When Abram wish'd Thou couldst afford

   With him to feast;

   When Lot but said, 'Turn in, my LORD,'

   Thou wert his guest.


   But, ah! this heart of mine doth pant,

   And beat for Thee;

   Yet Thou art strange, and wilt not grant

   Thyself to me.


   What, shall Thy people be so dear

   To Thee no more?

   Or is not heaven to earth as near

   As heretofore?


   The famish'd raven's hoarser cry

   Finds out Thine ear;

   My soul is famish'd, and I die

   Unless Thou hear.


   O Thou great ALPHA! King of kings!

   Or bow to me,

   Or lend my soul seraphic wings,

   To get to Thee.

   Eternal Mover, whose diffuséd glory,

   To show our grovelling reason what Thou art,

   Unfolds itself in clouds of nature's story,

   Where Man, Thy proudest creature, acts his part;

   Whom yet, alas, I know not why, we call

   The world's contracted sum, the little all;


   For what are we but lumps of walking clay?

   Why should we swell? whence should our spirits rise?

   Are not brute beasts as strong, and birds as gay,--

   Trees longer lived, and creeping things as wise?

   Only our souls were left an inward light,

   To feel our weakness, and confess Thy might.


   Thou then, our strength, Father of life and death,

   To whom our thanks, our vows, ourselves we owe,

   From me, Thy tenant of this fading breath,

   Accept those lines which from Thy goodness flow;

   And Thou, that wert Thy regal Prophet's muse,

   Do not Thy praise in weaker strains refuse!


   Let these poor notes ascend unto Thy throne,

   Where majesty doth sit with mercy crown'd,

   Where my Redeemer lives, in Whom alone

   The errors of my wandering life are drown'd:

   Where all the choir of Heaven resound the same,

   That only Thine, Thine is the saving Name!


   Well, then, my soul, joy in the midst of pain;

   Thy CHRIST, that conquer'd Hell, shall from above

   With greater triumph yet return again,

   And conquer His own justice with His love;

   Commanding earth and seas to render those

   Unto His bliss, for whom He paid His woes.


   Now have I done; now are my thoughts at peace;

   And now my joys are stronger than my grief:

   I feel those comforts, that shall never cease,

   Future in hope, but present in belief;

   Thy words are true, Thy promises are just,

   And Thou wilt find Thy dearly-bought in dust!

   On which thy Saviour and thy sin did die!

   For in that sacred object is much pleasure,

   And in that Saviour is my life, my treasure.

   To Thee my hands, to Thee my humble knees;

   ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY

THE HYMN

   J. Milton


   This is the month, and this the happy morn,

   Wherein the Son of Heaven's eternal King,

   Of wedded Maid and Virgin Mother born,

   Our great redemption from above did bring;

   For so the holy sages once did sing,

   That He our deadly forfeit should release,

   And with His Father work us a perpetual peace.


   That glorious Form, that light unsufferable,

   And that far-beaming blaze of majesty,

   Wherewith He wont at Heaven's high council-table

   To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,

   He laid aside; and, here with us to be,

   Forsook the courts of everlasting day,

   And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.


   Say, Heavenly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein

   Afford a present to the Infant GOD?

   Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,

   To welcome Him to this His new abode,

   Now while the heaven, by the sun's team untrod,

   Hath took no print of the approaching light,

   And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?


   See how from far upon the eastern road

   The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet!

   Oh run, prevent them with thy humble ode,

   And lay it lowly at His blesséd feet;

   Have thou the honour first thy LORD to greet,

   And join thy voice unto the angel quire,

   From out His secret altar touch'd with hallow'd fire.


   It was the winter wild,

   While the heaven-born Child

   All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;

   Nature, in awe to Him,

   Had doff'd her gaudy trim,

   With her great Master so to sympathize:

   It was no season then for her

   To wanton with the Sun, her lusty paramour.


   Only with speeches fair

   She woos the gentle air

   To hide her [41]guilty front with innocent snow,

   And on her naked shame,

   Pollute with sinful blame,

   The saintly veil of maiden white to throw;

   Confounded, that her Maker's eyes

   Should look so near upon her foul deformities.


   But He, her fears to cease,

   Sent down the meek-eyed Peace;

   She, crown'd with olive green, came softly sliding

   Down through the turning sphere [76]

   His ready harbinger,

   With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing,

   And waving wide her myrtle wand,

   She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.


   No war, or battle's sound,

   Was heard the world around;

   The idle spear and shield were high uphung;

   The hookéd chariot stood,

   Unstain'd with hostile blood;

   The trumpet spake not to the arméd throng;

   And kings sat still with awful eye,

   As if they surely knew their sovran LORD was by.


   But peaceful was the night,

   Wherein the Prince of Light

   His reign of peace upon the earth began:

   The winds with wonder whist [77]

   Smoothly the waters kiss'd,

   Whispering new joys to the mild Oceán;

   Who now hath quite forgot to rave,

   While birds of calm sit brooding on the charméd wave.


   The stars with deep amaze

   Stand fix'd in steadfast gaze,

   Bending one way their precious influence;

   And will not take their flight,

   For all the morning light,

   Or Lucifer [78] that often warn'd them thence;

   But in their glimmering orbs did glow,

   Until their Lord Himself bespake, and bid them go.


   And though the shady gloom

   Had given day her room,

   The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed,

   And bid his head for shame,

   As his inferior flame

   The new-enlighten'd world no more should need:

   He saw a greater Sun appear

   Than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear.


   The shepherds on the lawn,

   Or ere the point of dawn,

   Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;

   Full little thought they than [79] ,

   That the mighty Pan [80]

   Was kindly come to live with them below;

   Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,

   Was all that did their silly [81] thoughts so busy keep.


   When such music sweet

   Their hearts and cars did greet,

   As never was by mortal finger strook;

   Divinely-warbled voice

   Answering the stringéd noise,

   As all their souls in blissful rapture took:

   The air, such pleasure loth to lose,

   With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.


   Nature that heard such sound

   Beneath the hollow round

   Of Cynthia's [82] seat, the airy region thrilling,

   Now was almost won

   To think her part was done,

   And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;

   She knew such harmony alone

   Could hold all Heaven and Earth in happier union.


   At last surrounds their sight

   A globe of circular light,

   That with long beams the shame-faced night array'd:

   The helméd Cherubim,

   And sworded Seraphim,

   Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd,

   Harping in loud and solemn quire

   With unexpressive [83] notes to Heaven's new-born Heir.


   Such music (as 'tis said)

   Before was never made,

   But when of old the Sons of Morning sung,

   While the Creator great

   His constellations set,

   And the well-balanced World on hinges hung,

   And cast the dark foundations deep,

   And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep.


   Ring out, ye crystal spheres!

   Once bless our human ears,

   (If ye have power to touch our senses so,)

   And let your silver chime

   Move in melodious time,

   And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow;

   And with your ninefold harmony

   Wake up full consort [84] to the angelic symphony.


   For if such holy song

   Enwrap our fancy long,

   Time will run back and fetch the Age of Gold,

   And speckled Vanity

   Will sicken soon and die,

   And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould,

   And Hell itself will pass away,

   And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.


   Yea, Truth and Justice then

   Will down return to men,

   Orb'd in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,

   Mercy will sit between,

   Throned in celestial sheen,

   With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;

   And Heaven, as at some festival,

   Will open wide the gates of her high palace-hall.


   But wisest Fate says No,

   This must not yet be so:

   The Babe lies yet in smiling infancy

   That on the bitter Cross

   Must redeem our loss;

   So both Himself and us to glorify:

   Yet first, to those ychain'd in sleep,

   The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,


   With such a horrid clang

   As on Mount Sinai rang,

   While the red fire and smouldering clouds out-brake:

   The aged Earth aghast,

   With terror of that blast,

   Shall from the surface to the centre shake;

   When, at the world's last sessión,

   The dreadful judge in middle air shall spread His throne.


   And then at last our bliss

   Full and perfect is,--

   But now begins; for from this happy day

   The old Dragon under ground

   In straiter limits bound,

   Not half so far casts his usurpéd sway,

   And, wroth to see his kingdom fail,

   Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.


   The oracles are dumb,

   No voice or hideous hum

   Runs through the archéd roof in words deceiving:

   Apollo from his shrine

   Can no more divine,

   With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.

   No nightly trance, or breathéd spell,

   Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.


   The lonely mountains o'er,

   And the resounding shore,

   A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;

   From haunted spring and dale,

   Edged with poplar pale,

   The parting Genius is with sighing sent;

   With flower-inwoven tresses torn

   The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.


   In consecrated earth,

   And on the holy hearth,

   The [42]Lars and Lemurés moan with midnight plaint;

   In urns and altars round,

   A drear and dying sound

   Affrights the [43]Flamens at their service quaint;

   And the chill marble seems to sweat,

   While each peculiar Power foregoes his wonted seat.


   Peor and Baälim

   Forsake their temples dim,

   With that [44]twice batter'd god of Palestine;

   And moonéd Ashtaroth,

   Heaven's queen and mother both,

   Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;

   The [45]Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn,

   In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.


   And sullen Moloch, fled,

   Hath left in shadows dread

   His burning idol all of blackest hue;

   In vain with cymbals' ring

   They call the grisly king,

   In dismal dance about the furnace blue;

   The brutish gods of Nile as fast,

   Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.


   Nor is [46]Osiris seen

   In Memphian grove or green,

   Trampling the unshower'd [85] grass with lowings loud

   Nor can he be at rest

   Within his sacred chest,

   Nought but profoundest Hell can be his shroud;

   In vain with timbrell'd anthems dark

   The sable-stoléd sorcerers bear his worshipp'd ark.


   He feels from Juda's land

   The dreaded Infant's hand;

   The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;

   Nor all the gods beside,

   Longer dare abide,

   Nor Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:

   Our Babe, to show His Godhead true,

   Can in His swaddling bands control the damnéd crew.


   So when the sun in bed,

   Curtain'd with cloudy red,

   Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,

   The flocking shadows pale

   Troop to the infernal jail;

   Each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave;

   And, the yellow-skirted Fays

   Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze.


   --But see! the Virgin blest

   Hath laid her Babe to rest:--

   Time is our tedious song should here have ending;

   Heaven's youngest-teeméd [86] star

   Hath fix'd her polish'd car,

   Her sleeping LORD with handmaid lamp attending:

   And all about the courtly stable

   Bright harness'd [87] Angels sit in order serviceable.

   UPON THE CIRCUMCISION


   Ye flaming Powers, and wingéd warriors bright,

   That erst with music, and triumphant song,

   First heard by happy watchful shepherds' ear,

   So sweetly sung your joy the clouds along

   Through the soft silence of the listening night;

   Now mourn; and if [88] , sad share with us to bear,

   Your fiery essence can distil no tear,

   Burn in your sighs, and borrow

   Seas wept from our deep sorrow:

   He Who with all Heaven's heraldry whilere

   Enter'd the world, now bleeds to give us ease;

   Alas, how soon our sin

   Sore doth begin

   His Infancy to seize!

   O more exceeding love, or law more just?

   Just law indeed, but more exceeding love!

   For we by rightful doom remediless

   Were lost in death, till He that dwelt above

   High throned in secret bliss, for us frail dust

   Emptied His glory, even to nakedness;

   And that great covenant which we still transgress

   Entirely satisfied,

   And the full wrath beside

   Of vengeful justice bore for our excess,

   And seals obedience first with wounding smart

   This day; but O! ere long

   Huge pangs and strong

   Will pierce more near His heart.

   ON TIME


   Fly, envious Time, till thou run out thy race;

   Call on the lazy leaden-stepping Hours,

   Whose speed is but the heavy plummet's pace;

   And glut thyself with what thy womb devours,

   Which is no more than what is false and vain,

   And merely mortal dross;

   So little is our loss,

   So little is thy gain!

   For when as each thing bad thou hast entomb'd,

   And last of all thy greedy self consumed,

   Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss

   With an individual kiss;

   And joy shall over-take us as a flood:

   When every thing that is sincerely good

   And perfectly divine,

   With Truth, and Peace, and Love, shall ever shine

   About the supreme Throne

   Of Him, t'Whose happy-making sight alone

   When once our heavenly-guided soul shall climb,

   Then, all this earthy grossness quit,

   Attired with stars, we shall for ever sit,

   Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee, O Time!

   That undisturbéd song of pure concent [89] ,

   Aye sung before the sapphire-colour'd Throne

   To Him that sits thereon,

   With saintly shout and solemn jubilee;

   Where the bright Seraphim in burning row

   Their loud uplifted Angel-trumpets blow,

   And the Cherubic host in thousand quires

   Touch their immortal harps of golden wires,

   With those just Spirits that wear victorious palms,

   Hymns devout and holy psalms

   Singing everlastingly:

   That we on Earth, with undiscording voice,

   May rightly answer that melodious noise;

   As once we did, till disproportion'd sin

   Jarr'd against nature's chime, and with harsh din

   Broke the fair music that all creatures made

   To their great LORD, Whose love their motion sway'd

   In perfect diapason, whilst they stood

   In first obedience, and their state of good.

   O may we soon again renew that song,

   And keep in tune with Heaven, till GOD ere long

   To His celestial consort [90] us unite,

   To live with Him, and sing in endless morn of light.

   Whose eyes are open while mine close;

   Let no dreams my head infest,

   But such as Jacob's temples blest.

   While I do rest, my soul advance;

   Make me to sleep a holy trance,

   That I may, my rest being wrought,

   Awake into some holy thought;

   And with as active vigour run

   My course as doth the nimble sun.

   Sleep is a death; Oh! make me try,

   By sleeping, what it is to die

   And as gently lay my head

   On my grave, as now my bed.

   Howe'er I rest, great GOD, let me

   Awake again at last with Thee.

   Fairest of morning lights appear,

   Thou blest and gaudy day [91] ,

   On which was born our Saviour dear;

   Arise and come away!


   This day prevents His day of doom;

   His mercy now is nigh,

   The mighty GOD of Love is come,

   The Dayspring from on high!


   Behold the great Creator makes

   Himself an house of clay,

   A robe of Virgin-flesh He takes

   Which He will wear for aye.


   Hark, hark, the wise Eternal Word

   Like a weak infant cries:

   In form of servant is the LORD,

   And GOD in cradle lies.


   This wonder struck the world amazed,

   It shook the starry frame;

   Squadrons of Spirits stood and gazed,

   Then down in troops they came.


   Glad Shepherds ran to view this sight;

   A quire of Angels sings;

   And eastern Sages with delight

   Adore this King of kings.


   Join then, all hearts that are not stone,

   And all our voices prove,

   To celebrate this Holy One,

   The GOD of peace and love.

   O sing the glories of our LORD;

   His grace and truth resound,

   And His stupendous acts record,

   Whose mercies have no bound!


   He made the all-informing light

   And hosts of Angels fair;

   'Tis He with shadows clothes the night,

   He clouds or clears the air.


   Those restless skies with stars enchased

   He on firm hinges set;

   The wave-embracéd earth He placed

   His hanging cabinet.


   We in His summer-sunshine stand,

   And by His favour grow;

   We gather what His bounteous hand

   Is pleaséd to bestow.


   When He contracts His brow, we mourn,

   And all our strength is vain;

   To former dust in death we turn,

   Till He inspire again.

   THE WHITE ISLAND

   R. Herrick


   In this world, (the Isle of Dreams),

   While we sit by sorrow's streams,

   Tears and terrors are our themes

   Reciting:


   But when once from hence we fly,

   More and more approaching nigh

   Unto young Eternity

   Uniting:


   In that whiter Island, where

   Things are evermore sincere;

   Candour [92] here, and lustre there

   Delighting:


   There no monstrous fancies shall

   Out of Hell an horror call,

   To create (or cause at all)

   Affrighting.


   There in calm and cooling sleep

   We our eyes shall never steep;

   But eternal watch shall keep,

   Attending [93]


   Pleasures, such as shall pursue

   Me immortalized, and you;

   And fresh joys, as never too

   Have ending.

   Thou bidst me come away,

   And I'll no longer stay,

   Than for to shed some tears

   For faults of former years;

   And to repent some crimes,

   Done in the present times:

   And next, to take a bit

   Of Bread, and Wine with it:

   To d'on [94] my robes of love,

   Fit for the place above;

   To gird my loins about

   With charity throughout;

   And so to travel hence

   With feet of innocence:--

   These done, I'll only cry

   'GOD mercy'; and so die.

   ETERNITY


   O Years! and Age! Farewell:

   Behold I go,

   Where I do know

   Infinity to dwell.


   And these mine eyes shall see

   All times, how they

   Are lost i' the Sea

   Of vast Eternity.


   Where never Moon shall sway

   The Stars; but she,

   And Night, shall be

   Drown'd in one endless Day.

   GRACE FOR A CHILD


   What GOD gives, and what we take,

   'Tis a gift for Christ His sake.

   Be the meal of beans and pease,

   GOD be thank'd for those and these:

   Have we flesh, or have we fish,

   All are fragments from His dish.

   He His Church save, and the King,

   And our Peace here, like a Spring,

   Make it ever flourishing.

   A THANKSGIVING TO GOD FOR HIS HOUSE


   LORD, Thou hast given me a cell

   Wherein to dwell;

   A little house, whose humble roof

   Is weather-proof;

   Under the spars of which I lie

   Both soft, and dry;

   Where Thou my chamber for to ward

   Hast set a Guard

   Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep

   Me, while I sleep.

   Low is my porch, as is my Fate,

   Both void of state;

   And yet the threshold of my door

   Is worn by the poor,

   Who thither come, and freely get

   Good words, or meat:

   Like as my Parlour, so my Hall

   And Kitchen's small:

   A little Buttery, and therein

   A little Bin,

   Which keeps my little loaf of Bread

   Unchipt, unflead [95] :

   Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar

   Make me a fire,

   Close by whose living coal I sit,

   And glow like it.

   LORD, I confess too, when I dine,

   The Pulse is Thine,

   And all those other bits, that be

   There placed by Thee;

   The Worts, the Purslain, and the mess

   Of water-cress,

   Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent;

   And my content

   Makes those, and my belovéd Beet,

   To be more sweet.

   'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering Hearth

   With guiltless mirth;

   And giv'st me Wassail-bowls to drink,

   Spiced to the brink.

   Lord, 'tis Thy plenty-dropping hand

   That soils [96] my land;

   And giv'st me, for my bushel sown,

   Twice ten for one:

   Thou mak'st my teeming Hen to lay

   Her egg each day:

   Besides my healthful Ewes to bear

   Me twins each year:

   The while the conduits of my Kine

   Run Cream, (for Wine,)

   All these, and better, Thou dost send

   Me, to this end,

   That I should render, for my part,

   A thankful heart;

   Which, fired with incense, I resign,

   As wholly Thine;

   But the acceptance,--that must be,

   My CHRIST, by Thee.

   LITANY


   In the hour of my distress,

   When temptations me oppress,

   And when I my sins confess,

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When I lie within my bed,

   Sick in heart and sick in head,

   And with doubts discomforted,

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When the house doth sigh and weep,

   And the world is drown'd in sleep,

   Yet mine eyes the watch do keep;

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When the artless Doctor sees

   No one hope, but of his fees,

   And his skill runs on the lees;

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When his potion and his pill

   Has or none, or little skill,

   Meet for nothing, but to kill;

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When the passing-bell doth toll,

   And the Furies in a shoal

   Come to fright a parting soul;

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When the tapers now burn blue,

   And the comforters are few,

   And that number more than true;

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When the Priest his last hath pray'd,

   And I nod to what is said,

   'Cause my speech is now decay'd;

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When (GOD knows) I'm toss'd about,

   Either with despair, or doubt;

   Yet before the glass be out,

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When the Tempter me pursu'th

   With the sins of all my youth,

   And half damns me with untruth;

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!


   When the judgment is reveal'd,

   And that open'd which was seal'd,

   When to Thee I have appeal'd;--

   Sweet Spirit comfort me!

   ON EASTER DAY

   M. Lord Westmoreland


   Each thing below here hath its day,

   As in the Proverb's said;

   And so it comes to pass that they [97]

   Conquer are Conqueréd.

   For He who for man's fault assign'd

   Death, and a Grave's reward,

   Was pleased those bands for to unbind,

   And so Himself not spared;

   But issuing forth His heavenly throne,

   Vouchsafes the earth to bless,

   And became here a little One,

   To make our crimes go less:

   Not that our disobedience can

   In weight or measure shrink,

   But that this Great Physician

   Before us takes the drink,

   That bitter potión we had

   Deserved to quaff; and thus

   He weeps Himself, and becomes sad

   To purchase joy for us.

   And more than so: for everyone

   Will for his friend lay down

   Some spark of love: but He alone

   His enemies to crown

   Refused not Death; so deep from high

   His mercies did extend;

   And if you ask the reason why,

   'Twas mere for Mercy's end.

   Yet that grim Death and mouldy Grave

   No longer be His prison

   Than He Himself alone would have,

   He bides not there, but's risen,

   And if we would as Conquerors rise

   With Him who vanquish'd those,

   We must not fear, where danger lies,

   For Him all to expose,

   But though the grave do open stand

   And persecutions reign

   At Hell's desire and Death's command,

   Look on our Sovereign.

   His Banner doth present the Cross

   He bore, and bare Him too

   For us; and we must count it loss

   To fail what He did do.

   Thus Sin and Hell, the Grave and Death,

   Must quit the field and fly,

   Whilst, in contempt of borrow'd breath,

   We'd live Eternally.

   --Thrice happy day, whereon the Sun

   Of Righteousness did rise,

   And such a glorious conquest won,

   By being our Sacrifice!

   And as unhappy he, that shall

   Not find the white [98] and best

   Of Stones, to mark the same withal,

   And prize't above the rest.

   ON JUSTICE AND MERCY

   Anon.


   Justice doth call for vengeance on my sins,

   And threatens death as guerdon for the same;

   Mercy to plead for pardon then begins,

   With saying, CHRIST hath undergone the shame.

   Justice shews me an angry GOD offended,

   And Mercy shews a Saviour crucified:

   Justice says, I that sinn'd must be condemnéd:

   Mercy replies, CHRIST for my sins hath died.

   Grim justice threats with a revengeful rod:

   Meek Mercy shews me an appeaséd GOD.

   LORD! though my sins make me for Justice fit,

   Through CHRIST let Mercy triumph over it.

   PEACE

   Anon.


   I sought for Peace, but could not find;

   I sought it in the city,

   But they were of another mind,--

   The more's the pity.

   I sought for Peace of country swain,

   But yet I could not find;

   So I, returning home again,

   Left Peace behind.

   Sweet Peace, where dost thou dwell? said I;--

   Methought a voice was given,

   'Peace dwelt not here, long since did fly

   To GOD in heaven.'

   Thought I, this echo is but vain,

   To folly 'tis of kin;

   Anon, I heard it tell me plain,

   'Twas kill'd by sin.

   Then I believed the former voice,

   And rested well content;

   Laid down and slept, rose, did rejoice,

   And then to Heaven went.

   There I enquired for Peace, and found it true:--

   An heavenly plant it was, and sweetly grew.

   SONG OF THE EMIGRANTS IN BERMUDA

   A. Marvell


   Where the remote Bermudas ride

   In the ocean's bosom unespied,

   From a small boat that row'd along

   The listening winds received this song:

   'What should we do but sing His praise

   That led us through the watery maze

   Where He the huge sea-monsters wracks,

   That lift the deep upon their backs,

   Unto an isle so long unknown,

   And yet far kinder than our own?

   He lands us on a grassy stage,

   Safe from the storms, and prelate's rage:

   He gave us this eternal Spring

   Which here enamels everything,

   And sends the fowls to us in care

   On daily visits through the air.

   He hangs in shades the orange bright

   Like golden lamps in a green night,

   And does in the pomegranates close

   Jewels more rich than Ormus shows:

   He makes the figs our mouths to meet,

   And throws the melons at our feet;

   But [55]apples plants of such a price,

   No tree could ever bear them twice.

   With cedars chosen by His hand

   From Lebanon He stores the land;

   And makes the hollow seas that roar

   Proclaim the ambergris on shore.

   He cast (of which we rather boast)

   The Gospel's pearl upon our coast;

   And in these rocks for us did frame

   A temple where to sound His name.

   O let our voice His praise exalt

   Till it arrive at Heaven's vault,

   Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may

   Echo beyond the Mexique bay!'

   --Thus sung they in the English boat

   A holy and a cheerful note:

   And all the way, to guide their chime,

   With falling oars they kept the time.

   THE CORONET


   When for the thorns with which I long, too long,

   With many a piercing wound,

   My Saviour's head have crown'd,

   I seek with garlands to redress that wrong:

   Through every garden, every mead,

   I gather flowers--(my fruits are only flowers),

   Dismantling all the fragrant towers [99]

   That once adorn'd my shepherdesse's head:

   And now, when I have summ'd up all my store,

   Thinking, (so I myself deceive),

   So rich a chaplet thence to weave

   As never yet the King of Glory wore:

   Alas! I find the Serpent old,

   That, twining-in his speckled breast,

   About the flowers disguised, does fold

   With wreaths of fame and interest.

   Ah, foolish man, that would'st debase with them,

   And mortal glory, Heaven's diadem!

   --But Thou Who only could'st the Serpent tame,

   Either his slippery knots at once untie,

   And disentangle all his winding snare;

   Or shatter too, with him, my curious frame [100] ,

   And let these wither--so that he may die--

   Though set with skill, and chosen out with care:

   That they, while Thou on both their spoils dost tread,

   May crown Thy feet, that could not crown Thy head.

   H. Vaughan


   Dear LORD, 'tis finish'd! and now he

   That copied it, presents it Thee.

   'Twas Thine first, and to Thee returns,

   From Thee it shined, though here it burns.

   If the sun rise on rocks, is't right,

   To call it their inherent light?

   No, nor can I say, this is mine,--

   For, dearest JESUS, 'tis all Thine,

   As Thy clothes,--when Thou with clothes wert clad--

   Both light from Thee, and virtue had;

   And now--as then--within this place

   Thou to poor rags dost still give grace.


   My dear Redeemer, the world's light,

   And life too, and my heart's delight!

   For all Thy mercies and Thy truth,

   Shew'd to me in my sinful youth,

   For my sad failings and my wild

   Murmurings at Thee, when most mild;

   For all my secret faults, and each

   Frequent relapse and wilful breach,

   For all designs meant against Thee,

   And every publish'd vanity

   Which Thou divinely hast forgiven,

   While Thy blood wash'd me white as Heaven,--

   I nothing have to give to Thee,

   But this Thy own gift, given to me.

   Refuse it not! for now Thy token

   Can tell Thee where a heart is broken.

   THE RETREAT


   Happy those early days, when I

   Shined in my Angel-infancy!

   Before I understood this place

   Appointed for my second race,

   Or taught my soul to fancy ought

   But a white celestial thought;

   When yet I had not walk'd above

   A mile or two from my first Love,

   And looking back--at that short space--

   Could see a glimpse of His bright face:--

   When on some gilded cloud, or flower,

   My gazing soul would dwell an hour,

   And in those weaker glories spy

   Some shadows of eternity:--

   Before I taught my tongue to wound

   My Conscience with a sinful sound,

   Or had the black art to dispense

   A several sin to every sense,

   But felt through all this fleshly dress

   Bright shoots of everlastingness.


   O how I long to travel back,

   And tread again that ancient track!

   That I might once more reach that plain

   Where first I left my glorious train [101] ;

   From whence the enlighten'd spirit sees

   That shady City of Palm-trees.

   But ah! my soul with too much stay

   Is drunk, and staggers in the way!

   Some men a forward motion love,

   But I by backward steps would move;

   And when this dust falls to the urn,

   In that state I came, return.

   CHILDHOOD

   Dazzles at it, as at eternity.

   Were now that Chronicle alive,

   Those white [102] designs which children drive [103] ,

   And the thoughts of each harmless hour,

   With their content, too, in my power,

   Quickly would I make my path even,

   And by mere playing go to Heaven.


   Dear, harmless age! the short, swift span

   Where weeping Virtue parts with man;

   Where love without lust dwells, and bends

   What way we please without self-ends.


   An age of mysteries! which he

   Must live twice [104] that would God's face see;

   Which angels guard, and with it play;--

   Angels! which foul men drive away.


   How do I study now, and scan

   Thee more than e'er I studied man,

   And only see through a long night

   Thy edges and Thy bordering light!

   O for Thy centre and mid-day!

   For sure that is the narrow way. [105]

   RULES AND LESSONS


   When first thy eyes unveil, give thy soul leave

   To do the like; our bodies but forerun

   The spirit's duty. True hearts spread, and heave

   Unto their GOD, as flowers do to the sun.

   Give Him thy first thoughts then; so shalt thou keep

   Him company all day, and in Him sleep.


   Yet never sleep the sun up;--Praÿer should

   Dawn with the day. There are set, awful hours

   'Twixt Heaven, and us. The manna was not good

   After sun-rising; fair [106] -day sullies flowers.

   Rise to prevent the sun; sleep doth sins glut,

   And Heaven's gate opens, when this world's is shut.


   Walk with thy fellow-creatures: note the hush

   And whispers amongst them. There's not a spring,

   Or leaf but hath his morning-hymn; Each bush

   And oak doth know I AM. Canst thou not sing?

   O leave thy cares and follies! go this way,

   And thou art sure to prosper all the day.


   To heighten thy devotions, and keep low

   All mutinous thoughts, what business e'er thou hast,

   Observe GOD in His works; here fountains flow,

   Birds sing, beasts feed, fish leap, and th' earth stands fast;

   [59]Above are restless motions, running lights,

   Vast circling azure, giddy clouds, days, nights.


   When Seasons change, then lay before thine eyes

   His wondrous method; mark the various scenes

   In heaven; hail, thunder, rain-bows, snow, and ice,

   Calms, tempests, light, and darkness, by His means;

   Thou canst not miss His praise; each tree, herb, flower

   Are shadows of His wisdom, and His power.

   Like a starved eaglet for Thine eye.

   Some kind herbs here, though low and far,

   Watch for and know their loving star.

   Mere seed, and after that, but grass;

   Before 'twas drest or spun; and when

   Made linen, who did wear it then:

   What were their lives, their thoughts and deeds,

   Whether good corn, or fruitless weeds.


   Thou knew'st this tree, when a green shade

   Cover'd it, since a cover [110] made,

   And where it flourish'd, grew, and spread,

   As if it never should be dead.


   Thou knew'st this harmless beast, when he

   Did live and feed by Thy decree

   On each green thing; then slept, well-fed--

   Clothed with this skin, which now lies spread

   A covering o'er this aged book,

   Which makes me wisely weep, and look

   On my own dust; mere dust it is,

   But not so dry and clean as this.

   Thou knew'st and saw'st them all, and though

   Now scatter'd thus, dost know them so.


   O knowing, glorious Spirit! when

   Thou shalt restore trees, beasts and men,

   When Thou shalt make all new again,

   Destroying only death and pain,

   Give him amongst Thy works a place,

   Who in them loved and sought Thy face!

   TO THE HOLY BIBLE


   O Book! Life's guide! how shall we part,

   And thou so long seized [111] of my heart;

   Take this last kiss; and let me weep

   True thanks to thee before I sleep.


   Thou wert the first put in my hand

   When yet I could not understand,

   And daily didst my young eyes lead

   To letters, till I learnt to read.

   But as rash youths, when once grown strong,

   Fly from their nurses to the throng,

   Where they new consorts choose, and stick

   To those till either hurt or sick;

   So with that first light gain'd from thee

   Ran I in chase of vanity,

   Cried [112] dross for gold, and never thought

   My first [63]cheap books had all I sought.

   Long reign'd this vogue; and thou, cast by,

   With meek, dumb looks didst woo mine eye,

   And oft left open, would'st convey

   A sudden and most searching ray

   Into my soul, with whose quick touch

   Refining still [113] , I struggled much.

   By this mild art of love at length

   Thou overcam'st my sinful strength,

   And having brought me home, didst there

   Shew me that pearl I sought elsewhere,--

   Gladness, and peace, and hope, and love,

   The secret favours of the Dove [114] ;

   Her quickening kindness, smiles and kisses,

   Exalted pleasures, crowning blisses,

   Fruition, union, glory, life,

   Thou didst lead to, and still all strife.

   Living, thou wert my soul's sure ease,

   And dying mak'st me go in peace:--

   Thy next effects no tongue can tell;

   Farewell, O book of GOD! farewell!

   RIGHTEOUSNESS


   Fair, solitary path! whose blesséd shades

   The old, white prophets planted first and drest;

   Leaving for us--whose goodness quickly fades,--

   A shelter all the way, and bowers to rest;


   Who is the man that walks in thee? who loves

   Heaven's secret solitude, those fair abodes,

   Where turtles build, and careless sparrows move,

   Without to-morrow's evils and future loads?


   Who hath the upright heart, the single eye,

   The clean, pure hand, which never meddled pitch?

   Who sees invisibles, and doth comply [115]

   With hidden treasures that make truly rich?




   He that doth seek and love

   The things above,

   Whose spirit ever poor, is meek and low;

   Who simple still and wise,

   Still homewards flies,

   Quick to advance, and to retreat most slow.


   Whose acts, words, and pretence,

   Have all one sense,

   One aim and end; who walks not by his sight;

   Whose eyes are both put out,

   And goes about

   Guided by faith, not by exterior light.


   Who spills no blood, nor spreads

   Thorns in the beds

   Of the distrest, hasting their overthrow;

   Making the time they had

   Bitter and sad

   Like chronic pains [116] , which surely kill, though slow.


   Who knows Earth nothing hath

   Worth love or wrath,

   But in his Hope and Rock is ever glad:

   Who seeks and follows peace,

   When with the ease

   And health of conscience it is to be had.


   Who bears his cross with joy,

   And doth employ

   His heart and tongue in prayers for his foes;

   Who lends, not to be paid,--

   And gives full aid

   Without that bribe which usurers impose.


   Who never looks on [117] Man

   Fearful and wan,

   But firmly trusts in GOD; The great man's measure,

   Though high and haughty, must

   Be ta'en in dust;

   But the good man is GOD's peculiar treasure.


   --Who doth thus, and doth not

   These good deeds blot

   With bad, or with neglect; and heaps not wrath

   By secret filth, nor feeds

   Some snake, or weeds,

   Cheating himself;--That man walks in this path.

   Ev'n what Thou wilt, and praise Thee too.


   My GOD, could I weep blood,

   Gladly I would;

   Or if Thou wilt give me that art,

   Which through the eyes pours out the heart,

   I will exhaust it all, and make

   Myself all tears, a weeping lake.


   O! 'tis an easy thing

   To write and sing;

   But to write true, unfeignéd verse

   Is very hard! O GOD, disperse

   These weights, and give my spirit leave

   To act as well as to conceive!


   O my GOD, hear my cry;

   Or let me die!

   THE AGREEMENT


   O GOD! I know and do confess

   My sins are great and still prevail:

   Most heinous sins and numberless!

   But Thy compassions cannot fail:--

   If Thy sure mercies can be broken,

   Then all is true my foes have spoken.


   But while Time runs, and after it

   Eternity, which never ends,

   Quite through them both, still infinite,

   Thy Covenant by CHRIST extends;

   No sins of frailty, nor of youth,

   Can foil His merits, and Thy truth.


   Wherefore with tears--tears by Thee sent--

   I beg my faith may never fail!

   And when in death my speech is spent,

   O let that silence then prevail!

   O chase in that cold calm my foes,

   And hear my heart's last private throes!

   THE REVIVAL


   Unfold! unfold! Take in His light,

   Who makes thy cares more short than night.

   The joys which with His day-star rise

   He deals to all but drowsy eyes;

   And, what the men of this world miss,

   Some drops and dews of future bliss.


   Hark! how the winds have changed their note!

   And with warm whispers call thee out;

   The frosts are past, the storms are gone,

   And backward life at last comes on.

   The lofty groves in express joys

   Reply unto the turtle's voice;

   And here in dust and dirt, O here

   The lilies of His love appear!

   THE WREATH


   Since I in storms used most to be,

   And seldom yielded flowers,

   How shall I get a wreath for Thee

   From those rude, barren hours?

   The softer dressings of the Spring,

   Or Summer's later store,

   I will not for Thy temples bring,

   Which thorns, not roses, wore.


   But a twined wreath of grief and praise,

   Praise soil'd with tears, and tears again

   Shining with joy, like dewy days,

   This day I bring for all Thy pain;

   Thy causeless pain! and, sad as death,

   Which sadness breeds in the most vain,

   --O not in vain--now beg Thy breath,

   Thy quickening breath, which gladly bears

   Through saddest clouds to that glad place,

   Where cloudless quires sing without tears,

   Sing Thy just praise, and see Thy face.
     __________________________________________________________________

   THE ECLIPSE


   Whither, O whither didst thou fly?

   When did I grieve Thine holy eye,

   When Thou didst mourn to see me lost,

   And all Thy care and counsels crost?

   O do not grieve, where'er Thou art!

   Thy grief is an undoing smart,

   Which doth not only pain, but break

   My heart, and makes me blush to speak.

   Thy anger I could kiss, and will;

   But--O--Thy grief, Thy grief, doth kill!

   THE MEN OF WAR [119]


   'If any have an ear'

   Saith holy John, 'then let him hear!

   He, that into captivity

   Leads others, shall a captive be.

   Who with the sword doth others kill,

   A sword shall his blood likewise spill.

   Here is the patience of the saints,

   And the true faith, which never faints.'


   For in this bright, instructing verse

   Thy saints are not the conquerers,

   But patient, meek, and overcome

   Like Thee, when set at nought and dumb.

   Armies Thou hast in Heaven, which fight

   And follow Thee, all clothed in white;

   But here on Earth--though Thou hadst need--

   Thou wouldst no legions, but wouldst bleed.

   The sword wherewith Thou dost command

   Is in Thy mouth, not in Thy hand;

   And all Thy saints do overcome

   By Thy blood, and their martyrdom.


   But seeing soldiers long ago

   Did spit on Thee, and smote Thee too;

   Crown'd Thee with thorns, and bow'd the knee,

   But [120] in contempt, as still we see,

   I'll marvel not at aught they do,

   Because they used my Saviour so;

   Since of my LORD they had their will,

   Thy servant must not take it ill.


   Dear JESUS, give me patience here,

   And faith to see my crown as near,

   And almost reach'd, because 'tis sure

   If I hold fast, and slight the lure.

   Give me humility and peace,

   Contented thoughts, innoxious ease,

   A sweet, revengeless, quiet mind,

   And to my greatest haters, kind.

   Give me, my GOD! a heart as mild

   And plain, as when I was a child.

   That when Thy throne is set, and all

   These conquerors before it fall,

   I may be found--preserved by Thee--

   Amongst that chosen company,

   Who by no blood--here--overcame,

   But the blood of the Blesséd Lamb.

   PEACE


   My soul, there is a country

   Far beyond the stars,

   Where stands a wingéd sentry

   All skilful in the wars:

   There above noise, and danger,

   Sweet Peace sits crown'd with smiles,

   And One born in a manger

   Commands the beauteous files [121] .

   He is thy gracious Friend,

   And--O my soul awake!--

   Did in pure love descend,

   To die here for thy sake.

   If thou canst get but thither,

   There grows the flower of Peace,

   The Rose that cannot wither,

   Thy fortress, and thy ease.

   Leave then thy foolish ranges,

   For none can thee secure,

   But One, Who never changes,

   Thy GOD, thy life, thy cure.

   And do they so? have they a sense

   Of aught but influence?

   Can they their heads lift, and expect,

   And groan too? why the Elect

   Can do no more; my volumes said

   They were all dull, and dead;

   They judged them senseless, and their state

   Wholly inanimate.

   Go, go; Seal up thy looks,

   And burn thy books!


   Sometimes I sit with Thee, and tarry

   An hour or so, then vary.

   Thy other creatures in this scene

   Thee only aim, and mean;

   Some rise to seek Thee, and with heads

   Erect, peep from their beds;

   Others, whose birth [123] is in the tomb,

   And cannot quit the womb,

   Sigh there, and groan for Thee,

   Their liberty.


   I would I were a stone, or tree,

   Or flower by pedigree,

   Or some poor highway herb, or spring

   To flow, or bird to sing!

   Then should I--tied to one sure state--

   All day expect my date [124] ;

   But I am sadly loose, and stray

   A giddy blast each way;

   O let me not thus range!

   Thou canst not change.

   RETIREMENT


   Fresh fields and woods! the Earth's fair face!

   GOD's footstool! and man's dwelling-place!

   I ask not why the first believer [125]

   Did love to be a country liver?

   Who to secure pious content

   Did pitch by groves and wells his tent;

   Where he might view his boundless sky,

   And all those glorious lights on high:

   With flying meteors, mists, and showers:

   Subjected hills, trees, meads, and flowers:

   And every minute bless the King

   And wise Creator of each thing.


   I ask not why he did remove

   To happy Mamre's holy grove,

   Leaving the cities of the plain

   To Lot and his successless train?

   All various lusts in cities still

   Are found; they are the thrones of ill;

   The dismal sinks, where blood is spill'd,

   Cages with much uncleanness fill'd:

   But rural shades are the sweet sense [126]

   Of piety and innocence;

   They are the meek's calm region, where

   Angels descend, and rule the sphere;

   Where Heaven lies leiguer [127] , and the Dove

   Duly as dew comes from above.

   If Eden be on Earth at all,

   'Tis that which we the country call.

   THE WATER-FALL


   With what deep murmurs, through Time's silent stealth,

   Dost thy transparent, cool, and watery wealth

   Here flowing fall,

   And chide [128] and call,

   As if his liquid, loose retinue [129] stay'd

   Lingering, and were of this steep place afraid;--

   The common pass,

   As clear as glass,

   All must descend

   Not to an end,

   But quicken'd by this deep and rocky grave,

   Rise to a longer course, more bright and brave.


   Dear stream! dear bank! where often I

   Have sate, and pleased my pensive eye;

   Why, since each drop of thy quick store

   Runs thither where it flow'd before,

   Should poor souls fear a shade or night,

   Who came--sure--from a sea of light?

   Or, since those drops are all sent back

   So sure to thee that none doth lack,

   Why should frail flesh doubt any more

   That what GOD takes He'll not restore?


   O useful element and clear!

   My sacred wash and cleanser here;

   My first consigner [130] unto those

   Fountains of life, where the Lamb goes!

   What sublime truths and wholesome themes

   Lodge in thy mystical, deep streams!

   Such as dull man can never find,

   Unless that Spirit lead his mind,

   Which first upon thy face did move

   And hatch'd all with His quickening love.

   As this loud brook's incessant fall

   In streaming rings restagnates all,

   Which reach by course the bank, and then

   Are no more seen: just so pass men.

   --O my invisible estate,

   My glorious liberty, still late!

   Thou art the channel my soul seeks,

CXXI


   I walk'd the other day, (to spend my hour),

   Into a field,

   Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield

   A gallant flower;

   But Winter now had ruffled all the bower

   And curious store,

   I knew there heretofore.


   Yet I, whose search loved not to peep and peer

   I' th' face of things,

   Thought with myself, there might be other springs

   Besides this here,

   Which, like cold friends, sees us but once a year;

   And so the flower

   Might have some other bower.


   Then taking up what I could nearest spy,

   I digg'd about

   That place where I had seen him to grow out;

   And by and by

   I saw the warm Recluse alone to lie,

   Where fresh and green

   He lived of us unseen.


   Many a question intricate and rare

   Did I there strow [132] ;

   But all I could extort was, that he now

   Did there repair

   Such losses as befell him in this air,

   And would ere long

   Come forth most fair and young.


   This past, I threw the clothes quite o'er his head;

   And stung with fear

   Of my own frailty, dropp'd down many a tear

   Upon his bed;

   Then sighing whisper'd 'Happy are the dead!

   What peace doth now

   Rock him asleep below!'


   And yet, how few believe such doctrine springs

   From a poor root,

   Which all the Winter sleeps here underfoot,

   And hath no wings

   To raise it to the truth and light of things;

   But is still trod

   By every wandering clod [133] .


   --O Thou! Whose Spirit did at first inflame

   And warm the dead,

   And by a sacred incubation, fed

   With life this frame,

   Which once had neither being, form, nor name;

   Giant I may so

   Thy steps track here below,


   That in these Masques and shadows, I may see

   Thy sacred way;

   And by those hid ascents climb to that day,

   Which breaks from Thee,

   Who art in all things, though invisibly:--

   Shew me Thy peace,

   Thy mercy, love, and ease.

   THE TIMBER


   Sure thou didst flourish once! and many springs,

   Many bright mornings, much dew, many showers

   Past o'er thy head; many light hearts and wings,

   Which now are dead, lodged in thy living bowers.


   And still a new succession sings and flies;

   Fresh groves grow up, and their green branches shoot

   Towards the old and still enduring skies,

   While the low violet thrives at their root.


   But thou beneath the sad and heavy line

   Of death, doth waste all senseless, cold and dark;

   Where not so much as dreams of light may shine,

   Nor any thought of greenness, leaf, or bark.


   And yet--as if some deep hate and dissent,

   Bred in thy growth betwixt high winds and thee,

   Were still alive--thou dost great storms resent [134]

   Before they come, and know'st how near they be.


   Else all at rest thou liest, and the fierce breath

   Of tempests can no more disturb thy ease;

   But this thy strange resentment after death

   Means only those who broke,--in life,--thy peace.


   So murder'd man, when lovely life is done,

   And his blood freezed, keeps in the centre still

   Some secret sense, which makes the dead blood run

   At his approach that did the body kill.


   --And is there any murderer worse than sin?

   Or any storms more foul than a lewd life?

   Or what resentient [135] can work more within,

   Than true remorse, when with past sins at strife?

   THE BIRD


   Hither thou com'st: the busy wind all night

   Blew through thy lodging, where thy own warm wing

   Thy pillow was. Many a sullen storm

   --For which coarse man seems much the fitter born--

   Rain'd on thy bed

   And harmless head:--


   And now as fresh and cheerful as the light

   Thy little heart in early hymns doth sing

   Unto that Providence, Whose unseen arm

   Curb'd them, and clothed thee well and warm.

   All things that be, praise Him; and had

   Their lesson taught them when first made.


   So hills and valleys into singing break;

   And though poor stones have neither speech nor tongue,

   While active winds and streams both run and speak,

   Yet stones are deep in admiratïon.

   Thus praise and praÿer here beneath the sun

   Make lesser mornings, when the great are done.

   THE SHOWER


   'Twas so; I saw thy birth:--That drowsy lake

   From her faint bosom breathed thee, the disease [136]

   Of her sick waters, and infectious ease.

   But, now at even,

   Too gross for heaven,

   Thou fall'st in tears, and weep'st for thy mistake.


   Ah! it is so with me: oft have I prest

   Heaven with a lazy breath; but fruitless this

   Pierced not; Love only can with quick access

   Unlock the way;

   When all else stray,

   The smoke and exhalations of the breast.


   Yet, if as thou dost melt, and with thy train

   Of drops make soft the Earth, my eyes could weep

   O'er my hard heart, that's bound-up and asleep;

   Perhaps at last,

   --Some such showers past--

   My GOD would give a Sun-shine after rain.

   THE NIGHT


   Through that pure virgin shrine,

   That sacred veil drawn o'er Thy glorious noon,

   That men might look and live, as glow-worms shine

   And face the moon:

   Wise Nicodemus saw such light

   As made him know his GOD by night.


   No mercy-seat of gold,

   No dead and dusty cherub, nor carved stone,

   But His own living works did my LORD hold

   And lodge alone;

   Where trees and herbs did watch and peep

   And wonder, while the Jews did sleep.


   Dear Night! this world's defeat;

   The stop to busy fools; Care's check and curb;

   The day of Spirits; my soul's calm retreat

   Which none disturb!

   CHRIST's progress [137] , and His prayer time;

   The hours to which high Heaven doth chime.


   There is in GOD--some say--

   A deep, but dazzling darkness; as men here

   Say it is late and dusky, because they

   See not all clear.

   O for that Night! where I in Him

   Might live invisible and dim!

   THE SHEPHERDS


   Sweet, harmless lives!--[up]on whose holy leisure

   Waits Innocence and pleasure--

   Whose leaders to those pastures and clear springs

   Were Patriarchs, Saints, and Kings:

   How happen'd it that in the dead of night

   You, only, saw true light,

   While Palestine was fast asleep, and lay

   Without one thought of Day?

   Was it because those first and blesséd swains

   Were pilgrims on those plains

   When they received the Promise, for which now

   'Twas there first shown to you?

   'Tis true He loves that dust whereon they go

   That serve Him here below,

   And therefore might, for memory of those,

   His love there first disclose;

   But wretched Salem, once His love, must now

   No voice nor vision know:--

   Her stately piles with all their height and pride,

   Now languishéd and died,

   And Bethlem's humble cots above them stept,

   While all her seërs slept;

   Her cedar, fir, hew'd stones and gold, were all

   Polluted through their fall,

   And those once sacred mansïons were now

   Mere emptiness and show.

   [68]This made the Angel call at reeds and thatch:--

   Yet where the shepherds watch,

   And GOD's own lodging--though He could not lack--

   To be a common rack [138] ,

   No costly pride, no soft-clothed luxury

   In those thin cells could lie;

   Each stirring wind and storm blew through their cots,

   Which never harbour'd plots;

   Only Content and Love and humble joys

   Lived there without all noise;

   Perhaps some harmless cares for the next day

   Did in their bosoms play,

   As where to lead their sheep, what silent nook,

   What springs or shades to look:

   But that was all; And now with gladsome care

   They for the town prepare;

   They leave their flock, and in a busy talk

   All towards Bethlem walk

   To see their souls' great Shepherd, Who was come

   To bring all stragglers home;

   Where now they find Him out, and, taught before,

   That Lamb of GOD adore,--

   That Lamb Whose days great kings and prophets wish'd

   And long'd to see, but miss'd.

   The first light they beheld was bright and gay,

   And turn'd their night to day;--

   But to this later light they saw in Him,

   Their day was dark and dim.

   And though Thou found'st no welcome here,

   Thou didst provide us mansions there.

   A stable was Thy Court, and when

   Men turn'd to beasts, beasts would be men:

   They were Thy courtiers; others none;

   And their poor manger was Thy throne.

   No swaddling silks Thy limbs did fold,

   Though Thou couldst turn Thy rags to gold.

   No rockers waited on Thy birth,

   No cradles stirr'd, nor songs of mirth;

   But Her chaste lap and sacred breast,

   Which lodged Thee first, did give Thee rest.

   Dear, beauteous Saint! more white than Day

   When in his naked, pure array;

   Fresher than morning-flowers, which shew

   As thou in tears dost, best in dew.

   How art thou changed! how lively-fair,

   Pleasing, and innocent an air,

   Not tutor'd by thy glass, but free,

   Native and pure, shines now in thee!

   But since thy beauty doth still keep

   Bloomy and fresh, why dost thou weep?

   This dusky state of sighs and tears

   Durst not look on those smiling years,

   When [70]Magdal-castle [140] was thy seat,

   Where all was sumptuous, rare and neat.

   Why lies this hair despiséd now

   Which once thy care and art did show?

   Who then did dress the much-loved toy,

   In spires, globes, angry [141] curls and coy,

   Which with skill'd negligence seem'd shed

   About thy curious, wild, young head?

   Why is this rich, this pistic [142] nard

   Spilt, and the box quite broke and marr'd?

   What pretty sullenness did haste

   Thy easy hands to do this waste?

   Why art thou humbled thus, and low

   As earth thy lovely head dost bow?

   Dear soul! thou knew'st flowers here on Earth

   At their LORD's foot-stool have their birth;

   Therefore thy wither'd self in haste

   Beneath His blest feet thou didst cast,

   That at the root of this green tree

   Thy great decays restored might be.

   Thy curious vanities and rare

   Odorous ointments, kept with care

   And dearly bought,--when thou didst see

   They could not cure nor comfort thee--

   Like a wise, early penitent,

   Thou sadly didst to Him present,

   Whose interceding, meek, and calm

   Blood, is the world's all-healing balm.

   This, this Divine Restorative

   Call'd forth thy tears, which ran in live

   And hasty drops, as if they had

   --Their LORD so near--sense to be glad.


   Learn, ladies, here the faithful cure

   Makes [143] beauty lasting, fresh and pure;

   Learn Mary's art of tears, and then

   Say, you have got the day from men.

   Cheap, mighty art! Her art of love,

   Who loved much, and much more could move;

   Her art! whose memory must last

   Till truth through all the world be past;

   Till His abused, despiséd flame [144]

   Return to Heaven, from whence it came,

   And send a fire down, that shall bring

   Destruction on his ruddy wing.


   Her art! whose pensive, weeping eyes,

   Were once sin's loose and tempting spies;

   But now are fixéd stars, whose light

   Helps such dark stragglers to their sight.

   Self-boasting Pharisee! how blind

   A judge wert thou, and how unkind!

   It was impossible, that thou,

   Who wert all false, should'st true grief know.

   Is't just to judge her faithful tears

   By that foul rheum thy false eye wears?


   This woman--say'st thou--is a sinner:

   And sate there none such at thy dinner?

   Go, leper, go! wash till thy flesh

   Comes like a child's, spotless and fresh;

   He is still leprous that still paints:

   Who saint themselves, they are no saints.

   THE ORNAMENT


   The lucky World shew'd me one day

   Her gorgeous mart and glittering store,

   Where with proud haste the rich made way

   To buy, the poor came to adore.


   Serious they seem'd, and bought up all

   The latest modes of pride and lust;

   Although the first must surely fall,

   And the last is most loathsome dust.


   But while each gay, alluring ware

   With idle hearts and busy looks

   They view'd,--for Idleness hath there

   Laid up all her archives and books,--


   Quite through their proud and pompous file,

   Blushing, and in meek weeds array'd,

   With native looks which knew no guile,

   Came the sheep-keeping Syrian Maid [145] .


   Whom straight the shining row all faced,

   Forced [146] by her artless looks and dress;

   THE WORLD


   I saw Eternity the other night,

   Like a great ring of pure and endless light,

   All calm, as it was bright;

   And round beneath it, Time, in hours, days, years,

   Driven by the spheres,

   Like a vast shadow moved; In which the world

   And all her train were hurl'd.


   The doting Lover in his quaintest strain

   Did there complain;

   Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his slights [147] ,

   Wit's sour [148] delights;

   With gloves and knots [149] , the silly snares of pleasure;

   Yet his dear treasure

   All scatter'd lay, while he his eyes did pour

   Upon a flower.


   The darksome Statesman [150] hung with weights and woe,

   Like a thick midnight-fog, moved there so slow,

   He did not stay, nor go;

   Condemning thoughts--like sad eclipses--scowl

   Upon his soul,

   And clouds of crying witnesses without

   Pursued him with one shout;

   Yet digg'd the mole, and lest his ways be found,

   Work'd under ground,

   Where he did clutch his prey; but One did see

   That policy;

   Churches and altars fed him; perjuries

   Were gnats and flies;

   It rain'd about him blood and tears, but he

   Drank them as free.


   The fearful Miser on a heap of rust

   Sate pining all his life there; did scarce trust

   His own hands with the dust;

   Yet would not place one piece above, but lives

   In fear of thieves:

   Thousands there were as frantic as himself,

   And hugg'd each one his pelf.

   The down-right Epicure placed heaven in sense,

   And scorn'd pretence;

   While others, slipt into a wide excess,

   Said little less;

   The weaker sort, slight, trivial wares enslave,

   Who think them brave [151] ;

   And poor, despiséd Truth sat counting by

   Their victory.


   Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,

   And sing, and weep, soar'd up into the ring;

   But most would use no wing.

   O fools--said I--thus to prefer dark night

   Before true light!

   To live in grots, and caves, and hate the day

   Because it shews the way:--

   The way, which from this dead and dark abode

   Leads up to GOD;

   A way where you might tread the Sun, and be

   More bright than he!

   But as I did their madness so discuss,

   One whisper'd thus,--

   This ring the Bride-groom did for none provide,

   But for His Bride.

   MAN


   Weighing the steadfastness and state

   Of some mean things which here below reside,

   Where birds, like watchful clocks, the noiseless date

   And intercourse of times divide;

   Where bees at night get home and hive; and flowers,

   Early as well as late,

   Rise with the sun, and set in the same bowers;--


   I would (said I) my GOD would give

   The staidness of these things to Man! For these

   To His divine appointments ever cleave,

   And no new business breaks their peace;

   The birds nor sow nor reap, yet sup and dine;

   The flowers without clothes live;

   Yet Solomon was never drest so fine.


   Man hath still either toys, or care;

   He hath no root, nor to one place is tied,

   But ever restless and irregular

   About this Earth doth run and ride.

   He knows he hath a home, but scarce knows where;

   He says it is so far [152] ,

   That he hath quite forgot how to go[1**above line] there.


   He knocks at all doors, strays and roams,

   Nay hath not so much wit as some stones [153] have,

   Which in the darkest nights point to their homes,

   By some hid sense their Maker gave;

   Man is the shuttle, to whose winding quest

   And passage[1**above line] through these looms

   GOD order'd motion, but ordain'd no rest.

   THE WORLD


   Thou art not Truth! for he that tries

   Shall find thee all deceit and lies.

   Thou art not Friendship! for in thee

   'Tis but the bait of policy,

   Which, like a viper lodged in flowers,

   Its venom through that sweetness pours;

   And when not so, then always 'tis

   A fading paint, the short-lived bliss

   Of air and humour [154] ; out and in,

   Like colours in a dolphin's skin:

   But must not live beyond one day,

   Or for convenience; then away.

   Thou art not Riches! for that trash,

   Which one age hoards, the next doth wash

   And so severely sweep away

   That few remember where it lay,

   So, rapid streams the wealthy land

   About them have at their command;

   And shifting channels here restore,

   There break down, what they bank'd before.

   Thou art not Honour! for those gay

   Feathers will wear and drop away;

   And princes to some upstart line

   Give new ones, that are full as fine.

   Thou art not Pleasure! for thy rose

   Upon a thorn doth still repose;

   Which, if not cropt, will quickly shed,

   But soon as cropt, grows dull and dead.

   Thou art the sand, which fills one glass,

   And then doth to another pass;

   And could I put thee to a stay,

   Thou art but dust! Then go thy way,

   And leave me clean and bright, though poor:

   Who stops thee doth but daub his floor;

   And, swallow-like, when he hath done,

   To unknown dwellings must be gone!


   Welcome, pure thoughts, and peaceful hours,

   Enrich'd with sunshine and with showers;

   Welcome fair hopes, and holy cares,

   The not to be repented shares

   Of Time and business: the sure road

   Unto my last and loved abode!

   O supreme Bliss:

   The Circle, Centre, and Abyss

   Of blessings, never let me miss

   Nor leave that path, which leads to Thee,

   Who art alone all things to me!

   I hear, I see, all the long day

   The noise and pomp of the Broad Way:

   I note their coarse and proud approaches,

   Their silks, perfumes, and glittering coaches.

   But in the Narrow Way to Thee

   I observe only poverty,

   And despised things; and all along

   The ragged, mean, and humble throng

   Are still on foot; and as they go

   They sigh, and say, their LORD went so.

   AN ELEGY


   Thou that know'st for whom I mourn,

   And why these tears appear,

   That keep'st account till he return

   Of all his dust left here;

   As easily Thou might'st prevent

   As now produce, these tears,

   And add unto that day he went

   A fair supply of years.

   But 'twas my sin that forced Thy hand

   To cull this primrose out,

   That by Thy early choice forewarn'd

   My soul might look about.


   O what a vanity is Man!

   How like the eye's quick wink

   His cottage fails; whose narrow span

   Begins e'en at the brink!

   Nine months Thy hands are fashioning us,

   And many years--alas!--

   Ere we can lisp, or aught discuss

   Concerning Thee, must pass;

   Yet have I known Thy slightest things,

   A feather, or a shell,

   A stick, or rod, which some chance brings,

   The best of us excel;--

   Yea, I have known these shreds outlast

   A fair compacted frame,

   And [71]for one twenty we have past [155]

   Almost outlive our name.

   Yet had our pilgrimage been free,

   And smooth without a thorn,

   Pleasures had foil'd [156] Eternity,

   And tares had choked the corn.

   Thus by the Cross Salvation runs;

   Affliction is a mother,

   Whose painful throes yield many sons,

   Each fairer than the other.

   A silent tear can pierce Thy throne,

   When loud joys want a wing;

   And sweeter airs stream from a groan,

   Than any arted [157] string.


   Thus, LORD, I see my gain is great,

   My loss but little to it,

   Yet something more I must entreat,

   And only Thou canst do it.

   O let me--like him--know my end!

   And be as glad to find it:

   And whatsoe'er Thou shalt commend

   Still let Thy servant mind it!

   Then make my soul white as his own,

   My faith as pure and steady,

   And deck me, LORD with the same crown

   That has crown'd him already!

   FRIENDS DEPARTED


   They are all gone into the world of light!

   And I alone sit lingering here;

   Their very memory is fair and bright,

   And my sad thoughts doth clear.


   It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,

   Like stars upon some gloomy grove,

   Or those faint beams in which this hill is drest

   After the sun's remove.


   I see them walking in an air of glory,

   Whose light doth trample [158] on my days:

   My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,

   Mere glimmering and decays.


   O holy Hope! and high Humility,

   High as the heavens above!

   These are your walks, and you have shew'd them me,

   To kindle my cold love.


   Dear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the Just,

   Shining no where, but in the dark;

   What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust;

   Could man outlook that mark!


   He that hath found some fledged bird's nest, may know

   At first sight, if the bird be flown;

   But what fair [73]well [159] or grove he sings in now,

   That is to him unknown.


   And yet as Angels in some brighter dreams

   Call to the soul, when man doth sleep:

   So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes

   And into glory peep.


   If a star were confined into a tomb,

   Her captive flames must needs burn there;

   But when the hand that lock'd her up, gives room,

   She'll shine through all the sphere.


   O Father of eternal life, and all

   Created glories under Thee!

   Resume Thy spirit [160] from this world of thrall

   Into true liberty.


   Either disperse these mists, which blot and fill

   THE DAWNING


   Ah! what time wilt Thou come? when shall that cry,

   The Bridegroom's coming! fill the sky?

   Shall it in the evening run

   When our words and works are done?

   Or will Thy all-surprizing light

   Break at midnight,

   When either sleep, or some dark pleasure

   Possesseth mad Man without measure?

   Or shall these early, fragrant hours

   Unlock Thy bowers?

   And with their blush of light descry

   Thy locks crown'd with eternity?

   Indeed, it is the only time

   That with Thy glory doth best chime;

   All now are stirring, every field

   Full hymns doth yield;

   The whole Creation shakes off night,

   And for Thy shadow, looks [161] the light;

   Stars now vanish without number,

   Sleepy planets set, and slumber,

   The pursy clouds disband, and scatter;

   All expect some sudden matter;

   Not one beam triumphs, but from far

   That Morning-star.


   O at what time soever Thou,

   --Unknown to us--the heavens wilt bow,

   And, with Thy Angels in the van,

   Descend to judge poor careless Man,--

   Grant, I may not like puddle lie

   In a corrupt security,

   Where, if a traveller water crave,

   He finds it dead, and in a grave;

   But as this restless, vocal Spring

   All day and night doth run, and sing,

   And though here born, yet is acquainted [162]

   Elsewhere, and flowing keeps untainted;

   So let me all my busy age

   In Thy free services engage;

   And though--while here--of force I must

   Have commerce sometimes with poor dust,

   And in my flesh, though vile and low,

   As this doth in her channel, flow [163] ,

   Yet let my course, my aim, my love,

   And chief acquaintance be above;

   So when that day and hour shall come,

   In which Thyself will be the Sun,

   Thou'lt find me drest, and on my way,

   Watching the break of Thy great day.

   The fields are long since white, and I

   With earnest groans for freedom cry;

   My fellow-creatures too say, Come!

   And stones, though speechless, are not dumb.

   Of my LORD's dead

   AN IDYLL OF CHRISTIAN LIFE


   Happy me! O happy sheep!

   Whom my GOD vouchsafes to keep,

   Ev'n my GOD, ev'n He it is

   That points me to these paths of bliss

   On Whose pastures cheerful Spring,

   All the year doth sit and sing,

   And rejoicing, smiles to see

   Their green backs wear His livery:

   Pleasure sings my soul to rest,

   Plenty wears me at her breast,

   Whose sweet temper teaches me

   Not wanton, nor in want to be.

   At my feet the blubbering mountain

   Weeping, melts into a fountain,

   Whose soft silver-sweating streams

   Make high-noon forget his beams:

   When my wayward breath is flying,

   He calls home my soul from dying,

   Strokes and tames my rabid grief,

   And does woo me into life:

   When my simple weakness strays,

   (Tangled in forbidden ways),

   He (my Shepherd) is my guide;

   He's before me, on my side;

   And behind me, He beguiles

   Craft in all her knotty wiles:

   He expounds the weary wonder

   Of my giddy steps, and under

   Spreads a path clear as the day,

   Where no churlish rub [166] says nay

   To my joy-conducted feet,

   Whilst they gladly go to meet

   Grace and Peace, to learn new lays

   Tuned to my great Shepherd's praise.


   Come now, all ye terrors, sally,

   Muster forth into the valley,

   Where triumphant darkness hovers

   With a sable wing, that covers

   Brooding horror. Come, thou Death,

   Let the damps of thy dull breath

   Over-shadow e'en that shade,

   And make Darkness' self afraid;

   There my feet, e'en there, shall find

   Way for a resolvéd mind.

   Still my Shepherd, still my GOD,

   Thou art with me; still Thy rod,

   And Thy staff, whose influence

   Gives direction, gives defence.

   At the whisper of Thy word

   Crown'd abundance spreads my board:

   While I feast, my foes do feed

   Their rank malice, not their need,

   So that with the self-same bread

   They are starved, and I am fed.

   How my head in ointment swims!

   How my cup o'er-looks her brims!

   So, e'en so still may I move

   By the line of Thy dear love;

   Still may Thy sweet mercy spread

   A shady arm above my head,

   About my paths; so shall I find

   The fair centre of my mind,

   Thy temple, and those lovely walls

   Bright ever with a beam that falls

   Fresh from the pure glance of Thine eye,

   Lighting to Eternity.

   There I'll dwell for ever, there

   Will I find a purer air

   To feed my life with, there I'll sup

   Balm and nectar in my cup;

   And thence my ripe soul will I breathe

   Warm into the arms of Death.

   What is House and what is Home,

   Where with freedom thou hast room,

   This you cannot take away?

   'Tis no thing with doors and walls,

   Which at every earthquake falls;

   No fair towers, whose princely fashion

   Is but Plunder's invitation;

   No stout marble structure, where

   Walls Eternity do dare;

   No brass gates, no bars of steel,

   Tho' Time's teeth they scorn to feel:

   Brass is not so bold as Pride,

   If on Power's wings it ride;

   Marble's not so hard as Spite

   Arm'd with lawless Strength and Might.

   Right and just Possession, be

   Potent names, when Laws stand free:

   But if once that rampart fall,

   Stoutest thieves inherit all:

   To be rich and weak's a sure

   And sufficient forfeiture.


   Seek no more abroad, say I,

   House and Home, but turn thine eye

   Inward, and observe thy breast;

   There alone dwells solid Rest.

   That's a close immuréd tower

   Which can mock all hostile power.

   To thyself a tenant be,

   And inhabit safe and free.

   Say not that this House is small,

   Girt up in a narrow wall:

   In a cleanly sober mind

   Heaven itself full room doth find.

   Th' Infinite CREATOR can

   Dwell in it; and may not Man?

   Here content make thy abode

   With thyself and with thy GOD.

   Here in this sweet privacy

   May'st thou with thyself agree,

   And keep House in peace, tho' all

   Th' Universe's fabric fall.

   No disaster can distress thee,

   Nor no Fury dispossess thee:

   Let all war and plunder come,

   Still may'st thou dwell safe at Home.


   Home is everywhere to thee,

   Who can'st thine own dwelling be;

   Yea, tho' ruthless Death assail thee,

   Still thy lodging will not fail thee;

   Still thy Soul's thine own; and she

   To an House removed shall be;

   An eternal House above,

   Wall'd, and roof'd, and paved with Love.

   There shall these mud-walls of thine,

   H. More


   Where's now the object of thy fears;

   Needless sighs and fruitless tears?

   They be all gone like idle dream

   Suggested from the body's steam.

   O Cave of horror black as pitch!

   Dark den of Spectres that bewitch

   The weaken'd phansy, sore affright

   With the grim shades of grisly Night.

   What's Plague and Prison? Loss of friends?

   War, Dearth, and Death that all things ends?

   Mere bug-bears for the childish mind:

   Pure panic terrors of the blind.


   Collect thy soul into one sphere

   Of light, and 'bove the earth it rear:

   Those wild scatter'd thoughts that erst

   Lay loosely in the World disperst

   Call in: Thy spirit thus knit in one

   Fair lucid orb; those fears be gone

   Like vain impostures of the Night

   That fly before the Morning bright.

   Then with pure eyes thou shalt behold

   How the first Goodness doth infold

   All things in loving tender arms:

   That deeméd mischiefs are no harms,

   But sovereign salves, and skilful cures

   Of greater woes the world endures;

   That Man's stout soul may win a state

   Far raised above the reach of Fate.


   Then wilt thou say, GOD rules the World,

   Though mountain over mountain hurl'd

   Be pitch'd amid the foaming main,

   Which busy winds to wrath constrain.

   His fall doth make the billows start

   And backward skip from every part,

   Quite sunk; then o'er his senseless side

   The waves in triumph proudly ride.

   Though inward tempests fiercely rock

   The tottering Earth, that with the shock

   High spires and heavy rocks fall down

   With their own weight drove into ground;

   Though pitchy blasts from Hell up-borne

   Stop the outgoings of the Morn,

   And Nature play her fiery games

   In this forced Night, with fulgurant [168] flames,

   Baring by fits for more affright

   The pale dead visages, ghastly sight

   Of men astonish'd at the stoure [169]

   Of Heaven's great rage, the rattling showers

   Of hail, the hoarse bellowing of thunder,

   Their own loud shrieks made mad with wonder:

   All this confusion cannot move

   The purgéd mind, freed from the love

   Of commerce with her body dear,

   Cell of sad thoughts, sole spring of fear.


   Whate'er I feel or hear or see

   Threats but these parts that mortal be.

   Nought can the honest heart dismay

   Unless the love of living clay,

   And long acquaintance with the light

   Of this Out-world, and what to sight

   Those too officious beams discover

   Of forms that round about us hover.


   Power, Wisdom, Goodness sure did frame

   This Universe, and still guide the same.

   But thoughts from passions sprung, deceive

   Vain mortals. No man can contrive

   A better course than what's been run

   Since the first circuit of the Sun.


   He that beholds all from on high

   Knows better what to do than I.

   I'm not mine own: should I repine

   If He dispose of what's not mine?

   Purge but thy soul of blind self-will,

   Thou straight shalt see GOD doth no ill.

   The world He fills with the bright rays

   Of His free goodness. He displays

   Himself throughout. Like common air

   That spirit of life through all doth fare,

   Suck'd in by them as vital breath

   That willingly embrace not death.

   But those that with that living Law

   Be unacquainted, cares do gnaw;

   Mistrust of GOD's good providence

   Doth daily vex their wearied sense.

   THE PHILOSOPHER'S DEVOTION:
   THE SONG OF BATHYNOUS


   Sing aloud, His praise rehearse,

   Who hath made the Universe.

   He the boundless Heavens has spread,

   All the vital Orbs has kned [170] ;

   He that on Olympus high

   Tends His flocks [171] with watchful eye,

   And this eye [172] has multiplied

   Midst each flock for to reside:

   Thus as round about they stray,

   Toucheth each with out-stretch'd ray;

   Nimble they hold on their way,

   Shaping out their Night and Day.

   Summer, Winter, Autumn, Spring,

   Their inclinéd Axes bring.

   Never slack they; none respires,

   Dancing round their central fires.


   In due order as they move,

   Echoes sweet be gently drove

   Thorough Heaven's vast hollowness,

   Which unto all corners press:

   Music that the heart of Jove [173]

   Moves to joy and sportful love;

   Fills the listening Sailors' ears

   Riding on the wandering spheres.

   Neither Speech nor Language is

   Where their voice is not transmiss. [174]


   GOD is Good, is Wise, is Strong,

   Witness all the creature-throng,

   Is confess'd by every tongue.

   All things back from whence they sprung,

   As the thankful rivers pay

   What they borrow'd of the sea.


   Now myself I do resign;

   Take me whole, I all am thine.

   Save me, GOD! from Self-desire,

   Death's pit, dark Hell's raging fire,

   Envy, Hatred, Vengeance, Ire:

   Let not Lust my soul bemire.


   Quit from these, Thy praise I'll sing,

   Loudly sweep the trembling string.

   Bear a part, O Wisdom's sons!

   Freed from vain Religïons.

   Lo! from far I you salute,

   Sweetly warbling on my lute,

   Indie, Egypt, Araby,

   Asia, Greece, and Tartary,

   Carmel-tracts and Lebanon,

   With the Mountains of the Moon,

   From whence muddy Nile doth run;

   Or where ever else you won [175]

   Breathing in one vital air,

   One we are, though distant far.


   Rise at once let's sacrifice,

   Odours sweet perfume the skies.

   See how heavenly lightning fires

   Hearts inflamed with high aspires!

   All the substance of our souls

   Up in clouds of incense rolls.

   Leave we nothing to ourselves,

   Save a voice, what need we else?

   Or an hand to wear and tire

   On the thankful lute or lyre.


   Sing aloud, His praise rehearse

   Who hath made the Universe.

   THE ASPIRATION

   J. Norris


   How long, great GOD, how long must I

   Immured in this dark prison lie;

   Where at the grates and avenues of sense,

   My soul must watch to have intelligence;

   Where but faint gleams of Thee salute my sight,

   Like doubtful moonshine in a cloudy night:

   When shall I leave this magic sphere,

   And be all mind, all eye, all ear?


   How cold this clime! And yet my sense

   Perceives e'en here Thy influence.

   E'en here Thy strong magnetic charms I feel,

   And pant and tremble like the amorous steel.

   To lower good, and beauties less divine,

   Sometimes my erroneous needle does decline,

   But yet, so strong the sympathy,

   It turns, and points again to Thee.


   I long to see this excellence

   Which at such distance strikes my sense.

   My impatient soul struggles to disengage

   Her wings from the confinement of her cage.

   Wouldst thou, great Love, this prisoner once set free,

   How would she hasten to be link'd to Thee!

   She'd for no angels' conduct stay,

   But fly, and love-on, all the way.

   SERAPHIC LOVE


   Through Contemplation's optics I have seen

   Him Who is 'fairer than the sons of men':

   The source of good, the light archetypal,

   Beauty in the original,

   'The fairest of ten thousand,' He,

   Proportion all and harmony;

   All mortal beauty's but a ray

   Of His bright ever-shining day;

   A little, feeble, twinkling star,

   Which, now the Sun's in place, must disappear:--

   There is but One that's good, there is but One that's fair.


   To Thee, Thou only Fair, my soul aspires

   With holy breathings, languishing desires.

   To thee m' inamoured panting heart does move,

   By efforts of ecstatic love.

   How do Thy glorious streams of light

   Refresh my intellectual sight!

   Tho' broken, and strain'd through a screen

   Of envious flesh that stands between!

   When shall m' imprison'd soul be free,

   That she Thy native uncorrected light may see,

   And gaze upon Thy beatific face to all eternity?

   THE BELOVED

   F. Quarles


   E'en like two little bank-dividing brooks,

   That wash the pebbles with their wanton streams,

   And having ranged and search'd a thousand nooks,

   Meet both at length in silver-breasted Thames,

   Where in a greater current they conjoin:

   So I my Best-beloved's am; so He is mine.


   E'en so we met; and after long pursuit,

   E'en so we join'd: we both became entire;

   No need for either to renew a suit,

   For I was flax and He was flames of fire:

   Our firm-united souls did more than twine;

   So I my Best-beloved's am; so He is mine.


   He is my Altar; I, His Holy Place;

   I am His guest; and He my living food;

   I'm His by penitence; He mine by grace;

   I'm His by purchase; He is mine, by blood;

   He's my supporting elm; and I His vine;

   Thus I my Best-beloved's am; thus He is mine,


   If all those glittering Monarchs that command

   The servile quarters of this earthly ball,

   Should tender, in exchange, their shares of land,

   I would not change my fortunes for them all:

   Their wealth is but a counter to my coin;

   The world's but their's; but my Beloved 's mine.

   QUIA AMORE LANGUEO


   You holy Virgins, that so oft surround

   The city's sapphire walls; whose snowy feet

   Measure the pearly paths of sacred ground,

   And trace the New Jerusalem's jasper street;

   Ah, you whose care-forsaken hearts are crown'd

   With your best wishes; that enjoy the sweet

   Of all your hopes; if e'er you chance to spy

   My absent Love, O tell Him that I lie

   Deep-wounded with the flames that furnaced from His eye.


   I charge you, Virgins, as you hope to hear

   The heavenly music of your Lover's voice;

   I charge you by the solemn faith ye bear

   To plighted vows, and to that loyal choice

   Of your affections; or, if aught more dear

   You hold; by Hymen; by your marriage-joys;

   I charge you tell Him, that a flaming dart,

   Shot from His eye, hath pierced my bleeding heart;

   And I am sick of love, and languish in my smart.


   Tell Him, O tell Him, how my panting breast

   Is scorch'd with flames, and how my soul is pined;

   Tell Him, O tell Him, how I lie opprest

   With the full torments of a troubled mind;

   O tell Him, tell Him, that He loves in jest,

   But I in earnest; tell Him, He's unkind:

   But if a discontented frown appears

   Upon His angry brow, accost His ears

   With soft and fewer words, and act the rest in tears.


   O, tell Him, that His cruelties deprive

   My soul of peace, while peace in vain she seeks;

   Tell Him those damask roses, that did strive

   With white, both fade, upon my sallow cheeks;

   Tell Him, no token doth proclaim I live,

   But tears, and sighs, and sobs, and sudden shrieks;

   Thus if your piercing words should chance to bore

   His harkening ear, and move a sigh, give o'er

   To speak; and tell Him,--Tell Him that I could no more.

   Close now thine eyes, and rest secure;

   Thy soul is safe enough; thy body sure;

   He that loves thee, He that keeps

   And guards thee, never slumbers, never sleeps.

   The smiling Conscience in a sleeping breast

   Has only peace, has only rest:

   The music and the mirth of kings

   Are all but very discords, when she sings:

   Then close thine eyes and rest secure;

   No sleep so sweet as thine, no rest so sure.

   My glass is half unspent; Forbear t'arrest

   My thriftless day too soon: my poor request

   Is that my glass may run but out the rest.


   My time-devoured minutes will be done

   Without Thy help; see, see how swift they run;

   Cut not my thread, before my thread be spun.


   The gain's not great I purchase by this stay;

   'What loss sustain'st Thou by so small delay,

   To whom ten thousand years are but a day?


   My following eye can hardly make a shift

   To count my wingéd hours; they fly so swift,

   They scarce deserve the bounteous name of gift.


   The secret wheels of hurrying Time do give

   So short a warning, and so fast they drive,

   That I am dead before I seem to live.


   And what's a Life? a weary Pilgrimage,

   Whose glory in one day doth fill the stage

   With Childhood, Manhood, and decrepit Age.


   And what's a Life? the flourishing array

   Of the proud Summer meadow, which today

   Wears her green plush, and is tomorrow hay.


   And what's a Life? a blast sustain'd with clothing,

   Maintain'd with food, retain'd with vile self-loathing:

   Then weary of itself, again'd to nothing.


   Read on this dial, how the shades devour

   My short-lived winter's day; hour eats up hour,

   Alas, the total's but from eight to four.


   Behold these Lilies (which Thy hands have made

   Fair copies of my life, and open laid

   To view) how soon they droop, how soon they fade!


   Shade not that dial, night will blind too soon;

   My nonaged day already points to noon;

   How simple is my suit! how small my boon!


   Nor do I beg this slender inch, to while

   The time away, or falsely to beguile

   My thoughts with joy; here's nothing worth a smile:


   No, no; 'tis not to please my wanton ears

   With frantic mirth, I beg but hours, not years;

   And what Thou giv'st me, I will give to tears.


   Draw not that soul which would be rather led;

   That Seed has yét not broke my Serpent's head:

   O shall I die before my sins are dead?


   Behold these rags; am I a fitting guest

   To taste the dainties of Thy royal feast,

   With hands and face unwash'd, ungirt, unblest?


   First, let the Jordan streams, (that find supplies

   From the deep fountain of my heart), arise,

   And cleanse my spots, and clear my leprous eyes.


   I have a world of sins to be lamented;

   I have a sea of tears that must be vented:

   O spare till then!--and then I die contented.

   G. Wither


   Behold the sun, that seem'd but now

   Enthronéd overhead,

   Beginning to decline below

   The globe whereon we tread;

   And he, whom yet we look upon

   With comfort and delight,

   Will quite depart from hence anon,

   And leave us to the night.


   Thus Time, unheeded, steals away

   The life which Nature gave;

   Thus are our bodies every day

   Declining to the grave:

   Thus from us all our pleasures fly

   Whereon we set our heart;

   And when the night of death draws nigh,

   Thus will they all depart.


   LORD! though the sun forsake our sight,

   And mortal hopes are vain;

   Let still Thine everlasting light

   Within our souls remain!

   And in the nights of our distress

   Vouchsafe those rays divine,

   Which from the Sun of Righteousness

   For ever brightly shine!

   Be still, my child, and lend thine ear,

   To hear me sing thy lullaby:

   My pretty lamb, forbear to weep;

   Be still, my dear; sweet baby, sleep.


   Thou blesséd soul, what canst thou fear?

   What thing to thee can mischief do?

   Thy GOD is now thy Father dear,

   His holy Spouse, thy Mother too.

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.


   Sweet baby, sleep, and nothing fear;

   For whosoever thee offends

   By thy Protector threaten'd are,

   And GOD and Angels are thy friends.

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.


   When GOD with us was dwelling here,

   In little babes He took delight;

   Such innocents as thou, my dear,

   Are ever precious in His sight.

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.


   A little infant once was He;

   And strength in weakness then was laid

   Upon His Virgin Mother's knee,

   That power to thee might be convey'd.

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.


   The King of kings, when He was born,

   Had not so much for outward ease;

   By Him such dressings were not worn,

   Nor such-like swaddling-clothes as these.

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.


   Within a manger lodged thy LORD,

   Where oxen lay, and asses fed:

   Warm rooms we do to thee afford,

   An easy cradle or a bed.

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.


   Thou hast, yet more, to perfect this,

   A promise and an earnest got

   Of gaining everlasting bliss,

   Though thou, my babe, perceiv'st it not;

   Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;

   Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.

   As that of Sion; and as full of sin:

   Nothing but thieves and robbers dwell therein:

   Enter, and chase them forth, and cleanse the floor;

   Crucify them, that they may never more

   Profane that holy place

   Where Thou hast chose to set Thy face.

   And then if our stiff tongues shall be

   Mute in the praises of Thy Deity,

   The stones out of the temple-wall

   Shall cry aloud, and call

   Hosannah! and Thy glorious footsteps greet.

   That I may long obey;

   If short--yet why should I be sad

   CHRIST leads me through no darker rooms

   Than He went through before;

   He that unto GOD's kingdom comes,

   Must enter by this door.


   Come, LORD, when grace has made me meet

   Thy blesséd face to see;

   For if Thy work on earth be sweet,

   What will Thy glory be!


   Then I shall end my sad complaints,

   And weary, sinful days;

   And join with the triumphant saints,

   To sing JEHOVAH's praise.

   Fain would my thoughts fly up to Thee,

   Thy peace, sweet LORD, to find;

   And thence look down below;

   How nothing, there, do all things seem,

   That here make such a show!


   Then round about I turn my eyes

   To feast my hungry sight;

   I meet with Heaven in every thing,

   In every thing delight.


   When I have thus triumph'd awhile,

   And think to build my nest,

   Some cross conceits come fluttering by,

   And interrupt my rest.


   Then to the earth again I fall,

   And from my low dust cry,

   'Twas not in my wing, LORD, but Thine,

   That I got up so high.


   And now, my GOD, whether I rise,

   Or still lie down in dust,

   Both I submit to Thy blest will;

   In both, on Thee I trust.


   Guide Thou my way, who art Thyself

   My everlasting End,

   That every step, or swift, or slow,

   Still to Thyself may tend!

   Him with cheerful notes admire;

   Chanting every day their lauds [176] ,

   While the grove their song applauds.


   Though their voices lower be,

   Streams have too their melody;

   Night and day they warbling run,

   Never pause, but still sing on.


   All the flowers that gild the spring

   Hither their still music bring;

   If Heaven bless them, thankful they

   Smell more sweet, and look more gay.

   This short office to our LORD;

   All things gives, and nothing owes.


   Wake, for shame, my sluggish heart,

   Wake, and gladly sing thy part:

   Learn of birds, and springs, and flowers,

   How to use thy noble powers.


   Call whole Nature to thy aid,

   Since 'twas He whole Nature made;

   Join in one eternal song,

   Who to one GOD all belong.

   And made our first fair day.


   Hail, generous Martyrs, whose strong hearts

   Bravely rejoiced to prove,

   How weak, pale Death, are all thy darts,

   Compared to those of Love.


   Hail, blesséd Confessors, who died

   A death too, Love did give;

   Whilst your own flesh ye crucified,

   To make your Spirit live.


   Hail, beauteous Virgins, whose chaste vows

   Renounced all fond desires:

   Who wisely chose your LORD for Spouse,

   And burn'd with His pure fires.


   Hail, all ye happy Spirits above,

   Who make that glorious ring

   About the sparkling Throne of Love,

   And there for ever sing.


   Hail, and among your crowns of praise,

   Present this little wreath,

   Which, while your lofty notes you raise,

   We humbly sing beneath.


   All glory to the sacred Three,

   One ever-living LORD;

   As at the first, still may He be

   Beloved, obey'd, adored,

   Behold we come, dear LORD, to Thee,

   And bow before Thy throne;

   We come to offer on our knee

   Our vows to Thee alone.


   Whate'er we have, whate'er we are,

   Thy bounty freely gave;

   Thou dost us here in mercy spare,

   And wilt hereafter save.


   Come then, my soul, bring all thy powers,

   And grieve thou hast no more,

   Bring every day thy choicest hours,

   And thy great GOD adore.


   But, above all, prepare thine heart

   On this, His own blest day,

   In its sweet task to bear thy part,

   And sing, and love, and pray.

   My LORD, my Love, was crucified;

   He all the pains did bear;

   But in the sweetness of His rest

   He makes His servants share.

   How sweetly rest Thy saints above

   Which in Thy bosom lie!

   The Church below doth rest in hope

   Of that felicity.


   Thou, LORD, who daily feed'st Thy sheep,

   Mak'st them a weekly feast;

   Thy flocks meet in their several folds

   Upon this day of rest:--

   Welcome and dear unto my soul

   Are these sweet feasts of love:

   But what a sabbath shall I keep

   When I shall rest above!


   I bless Thy wise and wondrous love,

   Which binds us to be free;

   Which makes us leave our earthly snares,

   That we may come to Thee!

   I come, I wait, I hear, I pray!

   Thy footsteps, LORD, I trace!

   I sing to think this is the way

   Unto my Saviour's face!

   There is a Stream, which issues forth

   From GOD's eternal Throne,

   And from the Lamb,--a living stream

   Clear as the crystal stone.


   The stream doth water Paradise;

   It makes the Angels sing;

   One cordial drop revives my heart;

   Hence all my joys do spring.


   Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,

   From fancy 'tis conceal'd,

   What Thou, LORD, hast laid up for Thine,

   And hast to me reveal'd.

   How shall I sing that Majesty

   Which Angels do admire?

   Let dust in dust and silence lie;

   Sing, sing, ye heavenly quire!

   Thousands of thousands stand around

   Thy throne, O GOD most high;

   Ten thousand times ten thousand sound

   Thy praise; but who am I?


   Thy brightness unto them appears,

   Whilst I Thy footsteps trace;

   A sound of GOD comes to my ears;

   But they behold Thy face.

   They sing because Thou art their sun:

   LORD, send a beam on me;

   For where heaven is but once begun,

   There hallelujahs be.


   How great a being, LORD, is thine,

   Which doth all beings keep!

   Thy knowledge is the only line

   To sound so vast a deep.

   Thou art a sea without a shore,

   A sun without a sphere;

   Thy time is now and evermore,

   Thy place is everywhere.


   Who would not fear Thy searching eye,

   Witness to all that's true!

   Dark Hell, and deep hypocrisy,

   Lie plain before Its view.

   Motions and thoughts before they grow,

   Thy knowledge doth espy;

   What unborn ages are to do,

   Is done before Thine eye.

   Alas, my GOD, that we should be

   Such strangers to each other!

   O that as friends we might agree,

   And walk and talk together!


   May I taste that communion, LORD,

   Thy people have with Thee?

   Thy Spirit daily talks with them,

   O let It talk with me!


   Like Enoch, let me walk with GOD,

   And thus walk out my day,

   Attended with the heavenly Guards,

   Upon the King's highway.


   When wilt Thou come unto me, LORD?

   O come, my LORD most dear!

   Come near, come nearer, nearer still:

   I'm well when Thou art near.


   There's no such thing as pleasure here;

   My JESUS is my all:

   As Thou dost shine or disappear,

   My pleasures rise and fall.


   When wilt Thou come unto me, LORD?

   For, till Thou dost appear,

   I count each moment for a day,

   Each minute for a year.

   THE WAYS OF WISDOM

   Anon.

End of Book First

[87]Book Second


   These sweeter far than lilies are,

   No roses may with these compare:

   How these excel,

   No tongue can tell

   Which he that well and truly knows

   With praise and joy he goes!

   How great and happy's he that knows his ways

   To be divine and heavenly joys:--

   To whom each city is more brave

   Than walls of pearl, and streets which gold doth pave:--

   Whose open eyes

   Behold the skies;

   Who loves their wealth and beauty more

   Than kings love golden ore!


   Who sees the heavenly ancient ways

   Of GOD the LORD, with joy and praise

   More than the skies:--

   With open eyes

   Doth prize them all; yea, more than gems,

   And regal diadems:

   That more esteemeth mountains, as they are,

   Than if they gold and silver were:

   To whom the sun more pleasure brings,

   Than crowns, and thrones, and palaces to kings;--

   That knows his ways

   To be the joys

   And way of GOD. These things who knows

   With joy and praise he goes!

   REASON

   A. Cowley


   The Holy Book, like the Eighth Sphere [177] , does shine

   With thousand lights of truth divine:

   So numberless the stars, that to the eye

   It makes but all one galaxy:--

   Yet Reason must assist too, for in seas

   So vast and dangerous as these,

   Our course by stars above we cannot know,

   Without the compass too below.


   Though Reason cannot through Faith's mysteries see,

   It sees that there and such they be;

   Leads to Heaven's-door, and there does humbly keep,

   And there through chinks and key-holes peep.

   Though it, like Moses, by a sad command

   Must not come into th' Holy Land,

   Yet thither it infallibly does guide,

   And from afar 'tis all descried.

   VENI CREATOR SPIRITUS

   J. Dryden


   Creator Spirit, by whose aid

   The world's foundations first were laid,

   Come, visit every pious mind;

   Come, pour Thy joys on human kind;

   From sin and sorrow set us free,

   And make Thy temples worthy Thee.


   O source of uncreated light,

   The Father's promised Paraclete!

   Thrice holy fount, thrice holy fire,

   Our hearts with heavenly love inspire;

   Come, and Thy sacred unction bring

   To sanctify us, while we sing.


   Plenteous of grace, descend from high,

   Rich in Thy sevenfold energy!

   Thou strength of His Almighty hand,

   Whose power does heaven and earth command;

   Proceeding Spirit, our defence,

   Who dost the gift of tongues dispense,

   And crown'st Thy gift with eloquence.


   Chase from our minds the infernal foe,

   And Peace, the fruit of Love, bestow;

   And lest our feet should step astray,

   Protect and guide us in the way.


   Make us eternal truths receive,

   And practise all that we believe:

   Give us Thyself, that we may see

   The Father and the Son by Thee.


   Immortal honour, endless fame,

   Attend the Almighty Father's name:

   The Saviour Son be glorified,

   Who for lost man's redemption died;

   And equal adoration be,

   Eternal Paraclete, to Thee.

   J. Addison


   How are Thy servants blest, O LORD!

   How sure is their defence!

   Eternal wisdom is their guide,

   Their help Omnipotence.


   In foreign realms, and lands remote,

   Supported by Thy care,

   Through burning climes I pass'd unhurt,

   And breathed in tainted air.


   Thy mercy sweeten'd every soil,

   Made every region please;

   The hoary Alpine hills it warm'd,

   And smoothed the Tyrrhene seas [178] .


   Think, O my soul, devoutly think,

   How, with affrighted eyes,

   Thou saw'st the wide-extended deep

   In all its horrors rise!


   Confusion dwelt in every face,

   And fear in every heart;

   When waves on waves, and gulphs on gulphs,

   O'ercame the pilot's art.


   Yet then from all my griefs, O LORD,

   Thy mercy set me free;

   Whilst, in the confidence of prayer,

   My soul took hold on Thee.


   For though in dreadful whirls we hung

   High on the broken wave,

   I knew Thou wert not slow to hear,

   Nor impotent to save.


   The storm was laid, the winds retired,

   Obedient to Thy will;

   The sea that roar'd at Thy command,

   At Thy command was still.


   In midst of dangers, fears, and death,

   Thy goodness I'll adore;

   And praise Thee for Thy mercies past,

   And humbly hope for more.


   My life, if Thou preserv'st my life,

   Thy sacrifice shall be;

   And death, if death must be my doom,

   Shall join my soul to Thee.

   When all Thy mercies, O my GOD,

   My rising soul surveys;

   Transported with the view, I'm lost

   In wonder, love, and praise.


   O how shall words with equal warmth

   The gratitude declare

   That glows within my ravish'd heart!

   But Thou canst read it there.


   Thy providence my life sustain'd,

   And all my wants redrest,

   When in the silent womb I lay,

   Or hung upon the breast.


   To all my weak complaints and cries

   Thy mercy lent an ear,

   Ere yet my feeble thoughts had learnt

   To form themselves in prayer.


   Unnumber'd comforts to my soul

   Thy tender care bestow'd,

   Before my infant heart conceived

   From Whom those comforts flow'd.


   When in the slippery paths of youth

   With heedless steps I ran,

   Thine arm unseen convey'd me safe,

   And led me up to man;


   Through hidden dangers, toils, and deaths,

   It gently clear'd my way,

   And through the pleasing snares of vice,

   More to be fear'd than they.


   When worn with sickness, oft hast Thou

   With health renew'd my face;

   And when in sins and sorrows sunk,

   Revived my soul with grace.


   Thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss

   Has made my cup run o'er,

   And in a kind and faithful friend

   Has doubled all my store.


   Ten thousand thousand precious gifts

   My daily thanks employ;

   Nor is the least a cheerful heart

   That tastes those gifts with joy.


   Through every period of my life,

   Thy goodness I'll pursue;

   And after death, in distant worlds,

   The glorious theme renew.


   When nature fails, and day and night

   Divide Thy works no more,

   My ever-grateful heart, O LORD,

   Thy mercy shall adore.


   Through all eternity, to Thee

   A joyful song I'll raise;

   For, oh! eternity's too short

   To utter all Thy praise.

   And spread the truth from pole to pole.

   MORNING HYMN

   T. Ken


   Awake, my Soul, and with the sun,

   Thy daily stage of duty run;

   Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise,

   To pay thy morning sacrifice.


   Thy precious time misspent, redeem;

   Each present day thy last esteem;

   Improve thy talent with due care,

   For the great day thyself prepare.


   Let all thy converse be sincere,

   Thy conscience as the noon-day clear;

   Think how all-seeing GOD thy ways,

   And all thy secret thoughts, surveys.


   By influence of the light divine,

   Let thy own light to others shine;

   Reflect all heaven's propitious rays,

   In ardent love, and cheerful praise.


   Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart,

   And with the Angels bear thy part,

   Who all night long unwearied sing

   High praise to the eternal King.


   Awake, awake! ye heavenly choir,

   May your devotion me inspire,

   That I, like you, my age may spend;

   Like you, may on my GOD attend.


   May I, like you, in GOD delight,

   Have all day long my GOD in sight,

   Perform, like you, my Maker's will--

   May I never more do ill!


   Had I your wings, to heaven I'd fly;

   But GOD shall that defect supply;

   And my soul, wing'd with warm desire,

   Shall all day long to heaven aspire.


   Glory to Thee, who safe hast kept,

   And hast refresh'd me whilst I slept:--

   Grant, LORD, when I from death shall wake,

   I may of endless light partake.


   I would not wake, nor rise again,

   E'en Heaven itself I would disdain,

   Wert not Thou there to be enjoy'd,

   And I in hymns to be employ'd.


   Heaven is, dear LORD, where'er Thou art;

   O never then from me depart;

   For to my soul, 'tis hell to be,

   But for one moment, without Thee.


   LORD, I my vows to Thee renew,

   Scatter my sins as morning dew;

   Guard my first springs of thought and will,

   And with Thyself my spirit fill.


   Direct, control, suggest, this day,

   All I design, or do, or say;

   That all my powers, with all their might,

   In Thy sole glory may unite.


   Praise GOD, from whom all blessings flow,

   Praise Him, all creatures here below;

   Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,

   Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

   EVENING HYMN


   Glory to Thee, my GOD, this night,

   For all the blessings of the light!

   Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,

   Beneath Thy own almighty wings.


   Forgive me, LORD, for Thy dear Son,

   The ill that I this day have done;

   That with the world, myself, and Thee,

   I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.


   Teach me to live, that I may dread

   The grave as little as my bed;

   Teach me to die, that so I may

   Rise glorious at the awful day.


   O! may my soul on Thee repose,

   And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close--

   Sleep, that may me more vigorous make,

   To serve my GOD when I awake!


   When in the night I sleepless lie,

   My soul with heavenly thoughts supply:

   Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,

   No powers of darkness me molest.


   Dull sleep!--of sense me to deprive;

   I am but half my days alive.

   Thy faithful lovers, LORD, are grieved,

   To lie so long of Thee bereaved.


   But though sleep o'er my frailty reigns,

   Let it not hold me long in chains,

   And now and then let loose my heart,

   Till it an Hallelujah dart.


   The faster sleep the sense doth bind,

   The more unfetter'd is the mind:

   O may my soul, from matter free,

   Thy loveliness unclouded see!


   O when shall I, in endless day,

   For ever chase dark sleep away,

   And hymns with the supernal choir

   Incessant sing, and never tire!


   You, my blest Guardian, whilst I sleep,

   Close to my bed your vigils keep,

   Divine Love into me instil,

   Stop all the avenues of ill:


   Thought to thought with my soul converse,

   Celestial joys to me rehearse,

   Or in my stead, all the night long,

   Sing to my GOD a grateful song.


   Praise GOD, from whom all blessings flow,

   Praise Him, all creatures here below;

   Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,

   Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

   MIDNIGHT HYMN


   My GOD, now I from sleep awake,

   The sole possession of me take;

   From midnight terrors me secure,

   And guard my heart from thoughts impure.


   Blest Angels! while we silent lie,

   Your Hallelujahs sing on high;

   You, ever wakeful near the Throne,

   Prostrate adore the Three in One.


   I with your choir celestial join,

   In offering up a hymn divine:

   With you in heaven I hope to dwell,

   And bid the night and world farewell.


   My soul, when I shake off this dust,

   LORD! in Thy arms I will intrust:

   O, make me Thy peculiar care,

   Some mansion for my soul prepare.


   Give me a place at Thy saints' feet,

   Or some fall'n Angel's vacant seat:

   I'll strive to sing as loud as they,

   Who sit above in brighter day.


   O may I always ready stand,

   With my lamp burning in my hand;

   May I in sight of heaven rejoice,

   Whene'er I hear the Bridegroom's voice!


   Glory to Thee, in light array'd,

   Who Light Thy dwelling-place hast made;

   A boundless ocean of bright beams

   From Thy all-glorious Godhead streams.


   The sun in its meridian height

   Is very darkness in Thy sight:

   My soul, O lighten and inflame,

   With thought and love of Thy great name.


   Blest JESU! Thou, on heaven intent,

   Whole nights hast in devotion spent;

   But I, frail creature, soon am tired,

   And all my zeal is soon expired.


   My soul!--how canst thou weary grow

   Of antedating bliss, below,

   In sacred hymns and heavenly love,

   Which will eternal be above?


   Shine on me, LORD! new life impart,

   Fresh ardours kindle in my heart;

   One ray of Thy all-quickening light

   Dispels the sloth and clouds of night.


   LORD! lest the tempter me surprise,

   Watch over Thine own sacrifice;

   All loose, all idle, thoughts cast out,

   And make my very dreams devout.


   Praise GOD, from whom all blessings flow,

   Praise Him, all creatures here below;

   Praise Him above, y' Angelic host,

   Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

   LIFE


   O fool,--of short-lived goods possest,--

   In mere uncertainties to rest;

   From your full barns and bags of gold,

   To dream of slowly growing old;--

   Can you bribe death, with all your store,

   To respite you one moment more?


   Tell me, my soul, is there no art,

   To arm against death's sudden dart?

   Has gracious Heaven contrived no way

   Of lengthening here our mortal stay,

   Or, on this momentaneous stage,

   In a short time to live an age?


   The infants from the font who fly,

   Unsullied, to the joys on high,

   Live longer than obdurate men,

   Who sin to threescore years and ten:--

   We those dear moments only live,

   Which, we to GOD devoutly give.

   GRATEFUL ASPIRATIONS


   I oft recal the moments dear,

   Enjoy'd in penitential tear:

   A beam of pardon through me shined,

   Diffusing sweetness o'er my mind;

   Upon my knees, while that I felt,

   I could eternally have dwelt.


   LORD! while in view Thy love I keep,

   The fruits of love I daily reap,

   Grief with fresh consolations cheer'd,

   Hope nearer towards assurance rear'd;

   Of GOD beloved, more likeness gain'd,

   Or frailty with fresh aids sustain'd:


   To prayer some gracious answer sent,

   Some meditation more intent,

   Or sudden fervency devout,

   Or heavenly guidance when in doubt--

   Ah, what am I, great GOD should be

   Thus wondrously benign to me!
     __________________________________________________________________

CLXXXII

   THE MISER


   I saw this day a miser old

   Receive and count a bag of gold;

   His spectacles he clear'd,

   And on his nostrils rear'd,

   Then moved his table toward the light,

   To gain an unobstructed sight.


   The pieces one by one he took,

   And fix'd on either side his look;

   The edge he search'd with care,

   To find deficience there;

   Next to the touchstone it applied,

   And by the current standard tried.


   Then reach'd his balance nicely made,

   Which smallest things minutely weigh'd;

   The piece which pass'd his view

   Into the scale he threw,

   Accounting what he must abate

   For every atom short of weight.


   Soon from the wretch I turn'd away,

   Idolater of shining clay;

   But Conscience me here check'd,

   And chid my self-neglect;

   She back me on a sudden drew,

   My observation to renew.


   'You,' Conscience said, 'that wretch despise,

   Who yet may teach you to be wise;

   He, with a mind full bent,

   On his own gain intent,

   His short-lived riches tells and weighs--

   You thus should number all your days.


   'Blest JESUS warn'd that, here below,

   Misers would in their conduct show

   More zeal for short-lived toys,

   Than saints for endless joys:

   If saints and misers we compare,

   The worldly-minded wisest are.'


   My conscience then my thought improved,

   And me to think of Judgment moved,

   When every act, word, thought,

   To GOD's tribunal brought,

   The Searcher of our hearts will try,

   More nicely than the miser's eye.


   On my past time I then reflect,

   Deploring sadly my neglect:

   Vast treasure I had heap'd,

   And should at death have reap'd,

   Had I the minutes, as they roll'd,

   Heeded, as that vile wretch his gold.


   In vanity I spent my prime:

   In age I wasted precious time--

   Time which I should employ

   'To purchase endless joy--

   Time which, when once away it flies,

   I never, never can reprise.


   I nothing should too dear esteem,

   My heedless minutes to redeem:--

   O that I had the power

   To live a year each hour,

   That I might, ere I breathed my last,

   Retrieve my idle minutes past!
     __________________________________________________________________

CLXXXIII

   NOW


   The Past can be no more--

   Whose misemploying I deplore:

   The Future is to me

   An absolute uncertainty:

   The Now, which will not with me stay,

   Within a second flies away.


   I heard GOD often say,

   Now, of salvation is the day,--

   But turn'd from heaven my view,

   I still had something else to do;

   Till GOD a dream instructive sent,

   To warn me timely to repent.


   Methought Death, with his dart,

   Had mortally transfix'd my heart;

   And devils round about,

   To seize my spirit flying out,

   Cried-'Now, of which you took no care,

   Is turn'd to Never and despair!


   I gave a sudden start,

   And waked, with Never in my heart:

   Still I that Never felt,

   Never upon my spirit dwelt;--

   A thousand thanks to GOD I paid,

   That my sad Never was delay'd.

   SIGHS


   Sighs--whether swift to Heaven they rise

   As morning gilds the skies--

   Or GOD, by omnipresent ear,

   When they are sigh'd, is near--

   Since GOD vouchsafes what I desire,

   'Twere fruitless to inquire.

   In Heaven accounts of sighs are kept,

   Of every tear that's wept;

   Saints feel the blessing back they bring,

   Swift as angelic wing:

   The humble what they beg obtain,--

   They never sigh in vain.

   AN ANODYNE

   See [92]Note


   As in the night I restless lie,

   I the watch-candle keep in eye;

   The innocent I often blame,

   For the slow wasting of its flame.

   Sweet ease!--O whither are you fled!--

   With one short slumber ease my head!


   My curtain oft I draw away,

   Eager to see the morning ray;

   But when the morning gilds the skies,

   The morning no relief supplies.

   To me, alas! the morning light

   Is as afflictive as the night.


   My vigorous cries to GOD ascend,

   Oh!--will not GOD my cries attend?

   Can GOD paternal love forbear--

   Can GOD reject a filial prayer?

   Is there in Heaven for me no cure--

   Why do I then such pains endure?


   My flesh in torture oft repines

   At what GOD for my good designs;

   My spirit the repiner chides,

   Submissive to GOD's will abides:

   GOD my disease and temper weighs;

   No pang superfluous on me lays.


   Why should I then my pains decline,

   Inflicted by pure love divine?

   Let them run out their destined course,

   And spend upon me all their force:

   Short pains can never grievous be,

   Which work a blest eternity.

   LOVE STRONG AS DEATH


   A saint, to few but GOD well known,

   Who seem'd in town to dwell alone:

   With few but saints who e'er conversed,

   His alms in secret who dispersed;

   Whose virtues lay so out of view,

   That Satan ne'er his saintship knew--

   Such was the Saint to JESUS dear,

   Who often made him visits here.


   JESUS to Death commission gave,

   To lay his body in the grave;--

   Death to confederate Hell reveal'd

   For whom his warrant next was seal'd.

   Death and Hell out together went,

   On the saint's endless ruin bent:

   They both approaching his sick-bed,

   His watchful Angel o'er his head

   Brandish'd his bright angelic blade,

   That neither could the saint invade.


   His license Death began to plead:

   'That,' said the Angel, 'you exceed;

   For, when his dying Heaven design'd,

   You should have left your hell behind--

   Hell, which Heaven damns to strict restraint,

   From troubling a departed saint.'


   The Angel, with his two-edged fire,

   Made the infernal Fiend retire;

   'Your dart,' said he, 'now on him try;

   In slumbers sweet you see him lie:

   Truth says that Love as Death is strong,

   To see the experiment I long--

   Death! what your strength is, fully say,

   And I'll his love against it weigh.'


   Grim Death replied--'What lovers dare

   Weak Love with this strong arm compare?

   I, a crown'd king, this sceptre sway;

   All living creatures me obey:

   I daily, round the heavenly arch,

   Arm'd with ten thousand terrors, march:

   My darts I at my pleasure fling,

   At statesman, hero, prelate, king.'


   'Blest Enoch and Elias flew

   To heavenly rest in spite of you:

   Love over dangers, tortures, pains,

   Invincible, the conquest gains;

   Contemns you when you, fierce, appear,

   And never feels what 'tis to fear.'


   'I vanquish'd your incarnate GOD,

   And on His grave triumphant trod:

   And can weak Love my force withstand,

   When JESUS own'd my conquering hand?'


   'Twas Love, not you, made GOD to die,

   That lovers might your darts defy;

   He down His life was pleased to lay,

   A ransom for man's guilt to pay.


   'Death! when to lovers you draw nigh,

   You're forced to lay your terrors by;

   When warrants are for lovers sign'd,

   You leave sting, sceptre, crown, behind:

   Love eyes dear JESUS on the tree,

   And from your tyranny is free.

   You force exert on brittle clay,

   Which has no power to disobey.

   Love fights with lust, the world, and hell,

   Has foes unnumber'd to repel;

   Love runs through life a dangerous course,

   And must at last take Heaven by force.


   'On dust you, like the serpent, feed;

   By Love the soul from dust is freed:

   You, sin-born, seize the baser part,

   Love keeps for GOD the heaven-born heart.

   --Death! you are mortal!--you'll at last

   Into the fiery lake be cast:

   Love will, immortal, still abide,

   Eternally beatified.'

   While shepherds watch'd their flocks by night

   All seated on the ground,

   The Angel of the LORD came down,

   And glory shone around.


   'Fear not,' said he; (for mighty dread

   Had seized their troubled mind;)

   'Glad tidings of great joy I bring

   To you and all mankind.


   'To you, in David's town, this day

   Is born of David's line

   The Saviour, Who is CHRIST the LORD;

   And this shall be the sign:--


   'The heavenly Babe you there shall find

   To human view display'd,

   All meanly wrapt in swathing-bands,

   And in a manger laid.'


   Thus spake the Seraph; and forthwith

   Appear'd a shining throng

   Of Angels, praising GOD, and thus

   Address'd their joyful song:--


   'All glory be to GOD on high,

   And to the earth be peace;

   Good-will henceforth from Heaven to men

   Begin, and never cease!'

   ANGELS' SONG

   J. Pomfret


   O Holy, holy, holy LORD,

   O Eternal GOD, Almighty One,

   Be Thou for ever, and be Thou alone,

   By all Thy creatures, constantly adored!

   Ineffable, co-equal Three,

   Who from non-entity gave birth

   To angels and to men, to Heaven and to Earth,

   Yet always wast Thyself, and wilt for ever be.

   But for Thy mercy, we had ne'er possest

   These thrones, and this immense felicity;

   Could ne'er have been so infinitely blest!

   Therefore all glory, power, dominion, majesty,

   To Thee, O Lamb of GOD, to Thee,

   For ever, longer than for ever, be!

   FELICITY

   I. Watts


   No; 'tis in vain to seek for bliss

   For bliss can ne'er be found

   Till we arrive where JESUS is,

   And tread on heavenly ground.


   There's nothing round these painted skies,

   Or round this dusty clod,

   Nothing, my soul! that's worth thy joys,

   Or lovely as thy GOD.


   'Tis Heaven on Earth to taste His love,

   To feel His quickening grace;

   And all the Heaven I hope above

   Is but to see His face.

   THE NATIVITY


   'Shepherds, rejoice, lift up your eyes,

   And send your fears away;

   News from the region of the skies!--

   Salvation's born to-day.


   'JESUS, the GOD whom Angels fear,

   Comes down to dwell with you;

   To-day He makes His entrance here,

   But not as monarchs do.


   No gold, nor purple swaddling-bands,

   Nor royal shining things;

   A manger for His cradle stands,

   And holds the King of kings.


   'Go, shepherds, where the Infant lies,

   And see His humble throne:--

   With tears of joy in all your eyes

   Go, shepherds, kiss the Son.'


   Thus Gabriel sang: and straight around

   The heavenly armies throng;

   They tune their harps to lofty sound,

   And thus conclude the song:


   'Glory to GOD that reigns above,

   Let peace surround the Earth;

   Mortals shall know their Maker's love,

   At their Redeemer's birth.'


   LORD! and shall angels have their songs,

   And men no tunes to raise?

   O may we lose these useless tongues,

   When they forget to praise!


   Glory to GOD that reigns above,

   That pitied us forlorn!

   We join to sing our Maker's love--

   For there's a Saviour born.

   Fairest of all the lights above,

   Thou Sun, whose beams adorn the spheres,

   And with unwearied swiftness move

   To form the circles of our years:

   Praise the Creator of the skies,

   That dress'd thine orb in golden rays;

   Or may the Sun forget to rise,

   If he forget his Maker's praise!


   Thou reigning beauty of the night,

   Fair queen of silence, silver Moon,

   Whose gentle beams and borrow'd light

   Are softer rivals of the noon,--

   Arise, and to that Sovereign Power,

   Waxing and waning, honours pay,

   Who bade thee rule the dusky hour,

   And half supply the absent day.


   Ye twinkling Stars, who gild the skies

   When darkness has its curtains drawn,

   Who keep your watch, with wakeful eyes,

   When business, cares, and day are gone:

   Proclaim the glories of your LORD,

   Dispersed through all the heavenly street,

   Whose boundless treasures can afford

   So rich a pavement for His feet.

   Infinite Power, Eternal LORD,

   How sovereign is Thy hand!

   All Nature rose t' obey Thy word,

   And moves at Thy command.


   With steady course Thy shining Sun

   Keeps his appointed way;

   And all the hours obedient run

   The circle of the day.


   But ah! how wide my spirit flies

   And wanders from her GOD!

   My soul forgets the heavenly prize,

   And treads the downward road.


   Shall creatures of a meaner frame

   Pay all their dues to Thee,

   --Creatures, that never knew Thy name,

   That never loved like me?


   Great GOD, create my soul anew,

   Conform my heart to Thine;

   Melt down my will, and let it flow,

   And take the mould divine.


   Seize my whole frame into Thy hand;

   Here all my powers I bring:

   Manage the wheels by Thy command,

   And govern every spring.


   Then shall my feet no more depart,

   Nor wandering senses rove;

   Devotion shall be all my heart,

   And all my passions, love.


   Then not the Sun shall more than I

   His Maker's law perform,

   Nor travel swifter through the sky,

   Nor with a zeal so warm.

   Where'er my flattering passions rove,

   I find a lurking snare;

   'Tis dangerous to let loose our love

   Beneath the Eternal Fair.


   Souls whom the tie of friendship binds,

   And partners of our blood,

   Seize a large portion of our minds,

   And leave the less for GOD.


   Nature has soft but powerful bands,

   And Reason she controls;

   While children with their little hands

   Hang closest to our souls.


   Thoughtless they act the old Serpent's part;

   What tempting things they be!

   LORD, how they twine about our heart,

   And draw it off from Thee!


   Dear Sovereign, break these fetters off,

   And set our spirits free;

   GOD in Himself is bliss enough;

   For we have all in Thee.

   Our hope for years to come,

   Thy saints have dwelt secure;

   Sufficient is Thine arm alone,

   And our defence is sure.


   Before the hills in order stood,

   Or earth received her frame,

   From everlasting Thou art GOD,

   To endless years the same.


   A thousand ages in Thy sight

   Are like an evening gone;

   Short as the watch that ends the night

   Before the rising sun.


   Time, like an ever-rolling stream,

   Bears all its sons away;

   They fly forgotten, as a dream

   Dies at the opening day.

   Our hope for years to come;

   Be Thou our guard while troubles last,

   And our eternal home!

   For all the pious dead,--

   Sweet is the savour of their names,

   Why should we tremble to convey

   Their relics to the tomb?

   There the Redeemer's body lay,

   And left a long perfume.


   The graves of all His saints He blest,

   And soften'd every bed;

   Where should the dying members rest,

   THE EXAMPLES OF THE SAINTS


   Give me the wings of faith, to rise

   Within the veil, and see

   The Saints above, how great their joys,

   How bright their glories be!


   Once they were mourning here below,

   And wet their couch with tears;

   They wrestled hard, as we do now,

   With sins, and doubts, and fears.


   I ask them whence their victory came;

   They, with united breath,

   Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,

   Their triumph to His death.


   They mark'd the footsteps that He trod;

   His zeal inspired their breast;

   And, following their incarnate GOD,

   Possess the promised rest.


   Our glorious Leader claims our praise,

   For His own pattern given;

   While the long cloud of witnesses

   Show the same path to Heaven.

   A CRADLE SONG

   See [99]Note


   Hush! my dear, lie still and slumber,

   Holy Angels guard thy bed!

   Heavenly blessings without number

   Gently falling on thy head.


   Sleep, my babe; thy food and raiment,

   House and home, thy friends provide;

   All without thy care or payment,

   All thy wants are well supplied.


   How much better thou'rt attended

   Than the Son of GOD could be,

   When from heaven He descended,

   And became a child like thee!


   Soft and easy is thy cradle:

   Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay:

   When His birthplace was a stable,

   And His softest bed was hay.


   See the kinder shepherds round Him,

   Telling wonders from the sky!

   Where they sought Him, there they found Him,

   With His Virgin-Mother by.


   See the lovely Babe a-dressing;

   Lovely Infant, how He smiled!

   When He wept, the Mother's blessing

   Soothed and hush'd the holy Child.


   Lo, He slumbers in His manger,

   Where the hornéd oxen fed;

   --Peace, my darling, here's no danger;

   Here's no ox a-near thy bed!


   May'st Thou live to know and fear Him,

   Trust and love Him all thy days;

   Then go dwell for ever near Him,

   See His face, and sing His praise!


   I could give thee thousand kisses,

   Hoping what I most desire;

   Not a mother's fondest wishes

   Can to greater joys aspire.

   Ye golden lamps of Heaven, farewell,

   With all your feeble light;

   Farewell thou ever-changing moon,

   Pale empress of the night.


   And thou, refulgent orb of day,

   In brighter flames array'd;

   --My soul, that springs beyond thy sphere,

   No more demands thine aid.


   Ye stars are but the shining dust

   Of my Divine abode,

   The pavement of those heavenly courts

   Where I shall reign with GOD.


   The Father of eternal light

   Shall there His beams display;

   Nor shall one moment's darkness mix

   With that unvaried day.


   No more the drops of piercing grief

   Shall swell into mine eyes;

   Nor the meridian sun decline

   Amidst those brighter skies.

   Chase all your fears away;

   And bow with pleasure down to see

   Thus low the Lord of life was brought;

   Such wonders Love can do;

   Thus cold in death that bosom lay,

   Which throbb'd and bled for you.


   Then raise your eyes, and tune your songs;

   The Saviour lives again!

   Not all the bolts and bars of death

   The Conqueror could detain:


   High o'er the angelic bands He rears

   His once dishonour'd head;

   And through unnumber'd years He reigns,

   Who dwelt among the dead.

   Jewels to Thee are gaudy toys,

   And gold is sordid dust.


   All my capacious powers can wish

   In Thee most richly meet:

   Nor to my eyes is life so dear

   Nor friendship half so sweet.


   I'll speak the honours of Thy name

   With my last labouring breath:

   Then speechless clasp Thee in my arms--

   The antidote of death.

   A HYMN ON RECOVERY FROM SEVERE ILLNESS

   C. Smart


   When Israel's ruler on the royal bed

   In anguish and in perturbation lay,

   The down relieved not his anointed head,

   And rest gave place to horror and dismay.

   Fast flow'd the tears, high heaved each gasping sigh,

   When God's own prophet thunder'd--'Monarch, thou must die.'


   'And must I go,' the illustrious mourner cried,

   'I who have served Thee still in faith and truth,

   Whose snow-white conscience no foul crime has dyed

   From youth to manhood, infancy to youth;

   Like David, who have still revered Thy word--

   The sovereign of myself, and servant of the LORD.'


   The Judge Almighty heard His suppliant's moan,

   Repeal'd his sentence, and his health restored;

   The beams of mercy on his temples shone,

   Shot from that Heaven to which his sighs had soar'd;

   The Sun retreated at his Maker's nod,

   And miracles confirm the genuine work of GOD.


   But, O Immortals!--What had I to plead

   When Death stood o'er me with his threatening lance,

   When reason left me in the time of need,

   And sense was lost in terror or in trance?

   My sinking soul was with my blood inflamed,

   And the celestial image sunk, defaced and maim'd.


   I sent back memory, in heedful guise,

   To search the records of preceding years;

   Home, like the raven to the ark, she flies,

   Croaking bad tidings to my trembling ears:

   O Sun, again that [179] thy retreat was made,

   And threw my follies back into the friendly shade!


   But soul-rejoicing health again returns,

   The blood meanders gentle in each vein;

   The lamp of life renew'd with vigour burns,

   And exiled reason takes her seat again:--

   Brisk leaps the heart, the mind's at large once more,

   To love, to praise, to bless, to wonder and adore.


   The virtuous partner of my nuptial bands

   Appear'd a widow to my frantic sight;

   My little prattlers, lifting up their hands,

   Beckon me back to them, to life, and light;

   I come, ye spotless sweets! I come again,

   Nor have your tears been shed, nor have ye knelt in vain.


   --All glory to the Eternal, to the Immense,

   All glory to the Omniscient and Good,

   Whose power 's uncircumscribed, Whose love 's intense,

   But yet Whose justice ne'er could be withstood

   Except thro' Him--thro' Him, Who stands alone,

   Of worth, of weight allow'd for all mankind to atone!


   O Penitence!--to virtue near allied,

   Thou canst new joys e'en to the blest impart;

   The listening Angels lay their harps aside

   To bear the music of thy contrite heart;

   And Heaven itself wears a more radiant face,

   When Charity presents thee to the Throne of grace!


   Chief of metallic forms is regal gold;

   Of elements, the limpid fount that flows;

   Give me 'mongst gems the brilliant to behold;

   O'er Flora's flock imperial is the rose:

   Above all birds the sovereign eagle soars;

   And monarch of the field the lordly lion roars.


   What can with great Leviathan compare,

   Who takes his pastime in the mighty main?

   What, like the Sun, shines thro' the realms of air,

   And gilds and glorifies th' ethereal plain?--

   Yet what are these to man, who bears the sway?

   For all was made for him--to serve and to obey.


   Thus in high Heaven Charity is great,

   Faith, hope, devotion hold a lower place;

   On her the Cherubs and the Seraphs wait,

   Her, every virtue courts, and every grace;

   See! on the right, close by the Almighty's throne,

   In Him she shines confess'd, Who came to make her known.


   Deep-rooted in my heart then let her grow,

   That for the past the future may atone;

   That I may act what Thou hast given to know,

   That I may live for Thee, and Thee alone,--

   And justify those sweetest words from Heaven,

   'That he shall love Thee most, to whom Thou'st most forgiven.'

   SONG TO DAVID


   He sang of GOD--the mighty source

   Of all things--the stupendous force

   On which all strength depends;

   From Whose right arm, beneath Whose eyes,

   All period, power, and enterprise

   Commences, reigns, and ends.


   Tell them, I AM, Jehovah said

   To Moses; while earth heard in dread,

   And, smitten to the heart,

   At once above, beneath, around,

   All Nature, without voice or sound,

   Replied, O LORD, THOU ART.


   The world,--the clustering spheres, He made,

   The glorious light, the soothing shade,

   Dale, champaign, grove, and hill;

   The multitudinous abyss,

   Where Secrecy remains in bliss,

   And Wisdom hides her skill.


   The pillars of the LORD are seven,

   Which stand from earth to topmost heaven;

   His Wisdom drew the plan;

   His Word accomplish'd the design,

   From brightest gem to deepest mine;

   From CHRIST enthroned, to Man.


   For Adoration all the ranks

   Of Angels yield eternal thanks,

   And David in the midst;

   With GOD's good poor, which, last and least

   In man's esteem, Thou to Thy feast,

   O blesséd Bridegroom, bid'st!


   For Adoration, David's Psalms

   Lift up the heart to deeds of alms;

   And he, who kneels and chants,

   Prevails his passions to control,

   Finds meat and medicine to the soul,

   Which for translation pants.


   For Adoration, in the dome

   Of CHRIST, the sparrows find a home;

   And on His olives perch:

   --The swallow also dwells with thee,

   O man of GOD's humility,

   Within his Saviour's Church.


   Sweet is the dew that falls betimes,

   And drops upon the leafy limes--

   Sweet, Hermon's fragrant air:

   Sweet is the lily's silver bell,

   And sweet the wakeful tapers' smell

   That watch for early prayer.


   Sweet the young nurse, with love intense,

   Which smiles o'er sleeping innocence;

   Sweet, when the lost arrive:

   Sweet the musician's ardour beats,

   While his vague mind's in quest of sweets,

   The choicest flowers to hive.


   Strong is the horse upon his speed;

   Strong in pursuit the rapid glede [180] ,

   Which makes at once his game:

   Strong the tall ostrich an the ground;

   Strong through the turbulent profound

   Shoots Xiphias [181] to his aim.


   Strong is the lion--like a coal

   His eyeball,--like a bastion's mole

   His chest against the foes:

   Strong the gier-eagle [182] on his sail;

   Strong against tide the enormous whale

   Emerges as he goes.


   But stronger still, in earth and air

   And in the sea, the man of prayer,

   And far beneath the tide:

   And in the seat to faith assign'd,

   Where ask is have, where seek is find,

   Where knock is open wide.


   Precious the penitential tear;

   And precious is the sigh sincere,

   Acceptable to GOD:

   And precious are the winning flowers,

   In gladsome Israel's feast of bowers

   Bound on the hallow'd sod.


   Glorious the sun in mid career;

   Glorious the assembled fires appear;

   Glorious the cornet's train:

   Glorious the trumpet and alarm;

   Glorious the Almighty's stretch'd-out arm;

   Glorious the enraptured main:


   Glorious the northern lights a-stream;

   Glorious the song, when GOD's the theme;

   Glorious the thunder's roar:

   Glorious Hosannah from the den;

   Glorious the catholic Amen;

   Glorious the martyr's gore:


   Glorious,--more glorious,--is the crown

   Of Him that brought salvation down,

   By meekness call'd Thy Son;

   Thou that stupendous truth believed;--

   And now the matchless deed's achieved,

   Determined, Dared, and Done.

   SIMEON WAITING

   M. Bruce


   When JESUS, by the Virgin brought,

   (So runs the law of Heaven),

   Was offer'd holy to the LORD,

   And at the altar given;


   Simeon the just and the devout,

   Who frequent in the fane

   Had for the Saviour waited long,

   But waited still in vain,--


   Came Heaven--directed at the hour

   When Mary held her Son;

   He stretchéd forth his aged arms,

   While tears of gladness run:


   With holy joy upon his face

   The good old father smiled,

   While fondly in his wither'd arms

   He clasp'd the promised Child.


   And then he lifted up to Heaven

   An earnest asking eye;

   'My joy is full, my hour is come;

   LORD, let Thy servant die.


   'At last my arms embrace my LORD;

   Now let their vigour cease;

   At last my eyes my Saviour see,

   Now let them close in peace!

   E'en from my mother's womb.


   In early days Thou wast my guide,

   And of my youth the friend;

   And as my days began with Thee,

   With Thee my days shall end.


   In former times, when trouble came,

   Thou didst not stand afar;

   Nor didst Thou prove an absent friend

   Amid the din of war.


   My GOD, who caused'st me to hope,

   When life began to beat,

   And when a stranger in the world

   Didst guide my wandering feet;


   Thou wilt not cast me off, when age

   And evil days descend;

   Thou wilt not leave me in despair,

   To mourn my latter end!


   I know the Power in Whom I trust,

   The Arm on Which I lean;

   He will my Saviour ever be,

   Who has my Saviour been.

   Messiah! at Thy glad approach

   The howling wilds are still;

   Thy praises fill the lonely waste,

   And breathe from every hill.


   The hidden fountains, at Thy call,

   Their sacred stores unlock;

   Loud in the desert sudden streams

   Burst living from the rock.


   The incense of the Spring ascends

   Upon the morning gale;

   Red o'er the hill the roses bloom,

   The lilies in the vale.


   The kingdom of Messiah come,

   Appointed times disclose;

   And fairer in Emmanuel's land

   The new Creation glows:--


   Renew'd, the earth a robe of light,

   A robe of beauty wears;

   And in new Heavens a brighter Sun

   Leads on the promised years.

   The GOD of Abraham praise,

   Who reigns enthroned above,

   Ancient of everlasting days,

   And GOD of love!

   Jehovah! Great I AM!

   By earth and Heaven confest;

   I bow and bless the sacred Name,

   For ever blest!


   The GOD of Abraham praise!

   At Whose supreme command

   From earth I rise, and seek the joys

   At His right hand:

   I all on earth forsake,

   Its wisdom, fame, and power,

   And Him my only portion make,

   My Shield and Tower.


   He by Himself hath sworn;

   I on His oath depend:

   I shall, on eagle's wings upborne,

   To Heaven ascend;

   I shall behold His face,

   I shall His power adore,

   And sing the wonders of His grace

   For evermore!


   There dwells the LORD our King,

   The LORD our Righteousness,

   Triumphant o'er the world and sin,

   The Prince of Peace!

   On Sion's sacred height

   His kingdom still maintains,

   And, glorious with His saints in light,

   For ever reigns!


   Before the great THREE-ONE

   They all exulting stand,

   And tell the wonders He hath done

   Through all their land;

   The listening spheres attend

   And swell the growing fame,

   And sing, in songs which never end,

   The wondrous Name!


   The GOD, who reigns on high,

   The great Archangels sing,

   And, 'Holy, holy, holy,' cry,

   'Almighty King!

   Who Was, and Is, the same,

   And evermore shall be!

   Jehovah! Father! Great I AM!

   We worship Thee!'


   Before the Saviour's face

   The ransom'd nations bow,

   O'erwhelm'd at His Almighty grace,

   For ever new:

   He shows His prints of Love;

   They kindle to a flame,

   And sound, through all the worlds above,

   The slaughter'd Lamb!


   The whole triumphant host

   Give thanks to GOD on high;

   'Hail! Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!'

   They ever cry:

   Hail! Abraham's GOD, and mine!

   I join the heavenly lays;

   All might and majesty are Thine,

   And endless praise!

   Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in Thee!

   Let the water and the blood

   From Thy riven side which flow'd,

   Be of sin the double cure,

   Cleanse me from its guilt and power.


   Not the labours of my hands

   Can fulfil Thy law's demands;

   Could my zeal no respite know,

   Could my tears for ever flow,

   All for sin could not atone;

   Thou must save, and Thou alone.


   Nothing in my hand I bring;

   Simply to Thy Cross I cling;

   Naked, come to Thee for dress;

   Helpless, look to Thee for grace;

   Foul, I to the Fountain fly;

   Wash me, Saviour, or I die!


   While I draw this fleeting breath,

   When my eyestrings break in death,

   When I soar through tracts unknown,

   See Thee on Thy judgment-throne;

   Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in Thee!

   Ah! give me, LORD, the single eye,

   Which aims at nought but Thee:

   I fain would live, and yet not I--

   Like Noah's dove, no rest I find

   But in Thy ark of peace;

   Thy cross, the balance [183] of my mind;

   Thy wounds, my hiding-place.


   In vain the tempter spreads the snare,

   If Thou my keeper art;

   --Get thee behind me, GOD is near,

   My Saviour takes my part!


   On Him my spirit I recline,

   Who put my nature on;

   And guide me to His throne.

   O let Thyself my portion be,

   Loved of my GOD, for Him again

   With love intense I burn;

   FOR A CHILD


   Lamb of GOD, I look to Thee;

   Thou shalt my example be;

   Thou art gentle, meek, and mild;

   Thou wast once a little child.


   Thou didst live to GOD alone;

   Thou didst never seek Thine own;

   Thou Thyself didst never please;

   GOD was all Thy happiness.


   Loving JESU, gentle Lamb,

   In Thy gracious hands I am;

   Make me, Saviour, what Thou art!

   Live Thyself within my heart!


   I shall then show forth Thy praise;

   Serve Thee all my happy days;

   Then the world shall always see

   CHRIST, the Holy Child, in me.

   WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL


   Come, O Thou Traveller unknown,

   Whom still I hold, but cannot see,

   My company before is gone,

   And I am left alone with Thee;

   With Thee all night I mean to stay,

   And wrestle till the break of day.


   I need not tell Thee who I am,

   My misery or sin declare;

   Thyself hast call'd me by my name;

   Look on Thy hands, and read it there!

   But Who, I ask Thee, Who art Thou?

   Tell me Thy Name, and tell me now.


   In vain Thou strugglest to get free,

   I never will unloose my hold;

   Art Thou the Man that died for me?

   The secret of Thy love unfold.

   Wrestling, I will not let Thee go,

   Till I Thy Name, Thy Nature know.


   Wilt Thou not yet to me reveal

   Thy new, unutterable Name?

   Tell me, I still beseech Thee, tell:

   To know it now, resolved I am:

   Wrestling, I will not let Thee go,

   Till I Thy Name, Thy Nature know.


   What though my shrinking flesh complain,

   And murmur to contend so long?

   I rise superior to my pain;

   When I am weak, then I am strong:

   And when my all of strength shall fail,

   I shall with the GOD-MAN prevail.


   My strength is gone; my nature dies;

   I sink beneath Thy weighty hand;

   Faint to revive, and fall to rise;

   I fall, and yet by faith I stand:

   I stand, and will not let Thee go,

   Till I Thy Name, Thy Nature know.


   Yield to me now, for I am weak,

   But confident in self-despair;

   Speak to my heart, in blessings speak,

   Be conquer'd by my instant prayer!

   Speak, or Thou never hence shalt move,--

   And tell me, if Thy Name is Love?


   --'Tis Love! 'tis Love! Thou diedst for me!

   I hear Thy whisper in my heart!

   The morning breaks, the shadows flee;

   Pure universal Love Thou art!

   To me, to all, Thy bowels move;

   Thy Nature and Thy Name is Love!


   My prayer hath power with GOD; the grace

   Unspeakable I now receive;

   Through faith I see Thee face to face,

   I see Thee face to face, and live:

   In vain I have not wept and [108]strove;

   Thy Nature and Thy Name is Love.


   I know Thee, Saviour, Who Thou art;

   JESUS, the feeble sinner's Friend!

   Nor wilt Thou with the night depart,

   But stay, and love me to the end!

   Thy mercies never shall remove--

   Thy Nature and Thy Name is Love!


   The Sun of Righteousness on me

   Hath [109]rose, with healing in His wings;

   Wither'd my nature's strength, from Thee

   My soul its life and succour brings;

   My help is all laid up above;

   Thy Nature, and Thy Name, is Love.


   Contented now upon my thigh

   I halt, till life's short journey end;

   All helplessness, all weakness, I

   On Thee alone for strength depend;

   Nor have I power from Thee to move;

   Thy Nature, and Thy Name, is Love.


   Lame as I am, I take the prey,

   Hell, earth, and sin, with ease o'ercome;

   I leap for joy, pursue my way,

   And as a bounding hart fly home--

   Through all eternity to prove,

   Thy Nature and Thy Name is Love!

   With strictest search survey;

   The deepest shades no more disguise

   Than the full blaze of day.


   Whom Thou dost guard, O King of kings,

   No evil shall molest:

   Under the shadow of Thy wings

   Shall they securely rest.


   Thy Angels shall around their beds

   Their constant stations keep;

   Thy faith and truth shall shield their heads,

   For Thou dost never sleep.

   And heavenly thoughts refresh'd,

   Our eyelids with the morn unclose,

   And bless the Ever-bless'd!

   For all the servants of our King,

   In Earth and Heaven, are one.


   One family we dwell in Him,

   One Church, above, beneath,

   Though now divided by the stream,

   The narrow stream of death.

   One army of the living GOD,

   To His command we bow;

   Part of His host hath cross'd the flood,

   And part is crossing now.


   Our old companions in distress

   We haste again to see,

   And eager long for our release

   And full felicity:--

   Oh! that we now might grasp our Guide!

   Oh! that the word were given!

   Come, LORD of hosts! the waves divide,

   And land us all in Heaven!

   JESU, Lover of my soul,

   Let me to Thy bosom fly,

   While the nearer waters roll,

   While the tempest still is high:

   Hide me, O my Saviour, hide

   Till the storm of life is past,

   Safe into the haven guide,

   O receive my soul at last!


   Other refuge have I none;

   Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;

   Leave, ah! leave me not alone,

   Still support and comfort me!

   All my trust on Thee is stay'd,

   All my help from Thee I bring:

   Cover my defenceless head

   With the shadow of Thy wing!


   Wilt Thou not regard my call?

   Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?

   Lo! I sink, I faint, I fall--

   Lo! on Thee I cast my care!

   Reach me out Thy gracious hand:

   While I of Thy strength receive,

   Hoping against hope I stand,

   Dying, and behold I live!


   Plenteous grace with Thee is found,

   Grace to cover all my sin;

   Let the healing streams abound;

   Make and keep me pure within:--

   Thou of Life the Fountain art,

   Freely let me take of Thee;

   Spring Thou up within my heart,--

   Rise to all eternity!

   To GOD, ye choir above, begin

   A hymn so loud and strong

   That all the universe may hear

   And join the grateful song.


   Praise Him, thou sun, Who dwells unseen

   Amidst transcendent light,

   Where thy refulgent orb would seem

   A spot, as dark as night.


   Thou silver moon, ye host of stars,

   The universal song

   Through the serene and silent night

   To listening worlds prolong.


   Sing Him, ye distant worlds and suns,

   From whence no travelling ray

   Hath yet to us, through ages past,

   Had time to make its way.


   Assist, ye raging storms, and bear

   On rapid wings His praise,

   From north to south, from east to west,

   Through heaven, and earth, and seas.


   Exert your voice, ye furious fires

   That rend the watery cloud,

   And thunder to this nether world

   Your Maker's words aloud.


   Ye works of GOD, that dwell unknown

   Beneath the rolling main;

   Ye birds, that sing among the groves,

   And sweep the azure plain;


   Ye stately hills, that rear your heads,

   And towering pierce the sky;

   Ye clouds, that with an awful pace

   Majestic roll on high;


   Ye insects small, to which one leaf

   Within its narrow sides

   A vast extended world displays,

   And spacious realms provides;


   Ye race, still less than these, with which

   The stagnant water teems,

   To which one drop, however small,

   A boundless ocean seems;


   --Whate'er ye are, where'er ye dwell,

   Ye creatures great or small,

   Adore the Wisdom, praise the Power,

   That made and governs all.

   There your seat is now prepared,

   There your kingdom and reward.


   Lift your eyes, ye sons of Light!

   Zion's city is in sight:

   There our endless home shall be,

   There our LORD we soon shall see.


   Fear not, brethren; joyful stand

   On the borders of your land;

   JESUS CHRIST, your Father's Son,

   Bids you undismay'd go on.

   Gladly leaving all below:

   Only Thou our Leader be,

   And we still will follow Thee.

   A VISION OF LIFE IN DEATH

   J. Newton

   See [113]Note


   In evil long I took delight,

   Unawed by shame or fear,

   Till a new object struck my sight,

   And stopp'd my wild career:

   I saw One hanging on a Tree

   In agonies and blood,

   Who fix'd His languid eyes on me,

   As near His Cross I stood.


   Sure never till my latest breath

   Can I forget that look:

   It seem'd to charge me with His death,

   Though not a word He spoke:

   My conscience felt and own'd the guilt,

   And plunged me in despair;

   I saw my sins His Blood had spilt,

   And help'd to nail Him there.


   Alas! I knew not what I did!

   But now my tears are vain:

   Where shall my trembling soul be hid?

   For I the LORD have slain!

   --A second look He gave, which said,

   'I freely all forgive;

   This Blood is for thy ransom paid

   I die, that thou may'st live.'


   Thus, while His death my sin displays

   In all its blackest hue,

   Such is the mystery of grace,

   It seals my pardon too.

   With pleasing grief, and mournful joy,

   My spirit now is fill'd,

   That I should such a life destroy,--

   Yet live by Him I kill'd!
     __________________________________________________________________

CCXXV


   Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat

   Where JESUS answers prayer;

   There humbly fall before His feet,

   For none can perish there.


   Thy promise is my only plea,

   With this I venture nigh;

   Thou callest burden'd souls to Thee,

   And such, O LORD, am I.


   Bow'd down beneath a load of sin,

   By Satan sorely prest,

   By war without, and fears within,

   I come to Thee for rest:--


   Be Thou my shield and hiding-place,

   That, shelter'd near Thy side,

   I may my fierce accuser face,

   And tell him, Thou hast died!
     __________________________________________________________________

CCXXVI


   How sweet the Name of JESUS sounds

   In a believer's ear!

   It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,

   And drives away his fear!


   It makes the wounded spirit whole

   And calms the troubled breast;

   Tis manna to the hungry soul,

   And to the weary, rest.


   Dear Name! the rock on which I build,

   My shield and hiding-place,

   My never-failing treasury, fill'd

   With boundless stores of grace,--


   By Thee my prayers acceptance gain,

   Although with sin defiled;

   Satan accuses me in vain,

   And I am own'd a Child.


   Weak is the effort of my heart,

   And cold my warmest thought;

   But, when I see Thee as Thou art,

   I'll praise Thee as I ought.


   Till then, I would Thy love proclaim

   With every fleeting breath;

   And may the music of Thy Name

   Refresh my soul in death!
     __________________________________________________________________

CCXXVII


   Quiet, LORD, my froward heart:

   Make me teachable and mild,

   Upright, simple, free from art,--

   Make me as a weanéd child:

   From distrust and envy free,

   Pleased with all that pleases Thee.


   What Thou shalt to-day provide,

   Let me as a child receive;

   What to-morrow may betide,

   Calmly to Thy wisdom leave;

   'Tis enough that Thou wilt care:

   Why should I the burden bear?


   As a little child relies

   On a care beyond his own,

   Knows he's neither strong nor wise,

   Fears to stir a step alone;

   Let me thus with Thee abide,

   As my Father, Guard, and Guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

[114]CCXXVIII

   W. Cowper


   The LORD will happiness divine

   On contrite hearts bestow;

   Then tell me, gracious GOD, is mine

   A contrite heart, or no?


   I hear, but seem to hear in vain,

   Insensible as steel;

   If aught is felt, 'tis only pain,

   To find I cannot feel.


   My best desires are faint and few,

   I fain would strive for more;

   But when I cry, 'My strength renew!'

   Seem weaker than before.


   Thy saints are comforted, I know,

   And love Thy house of prayer;

   I therefore go where others go,

   But find no comfort there.


   Oh make this heart rejoice or ache!

   Decide this doubt for me;

   And if it be not broken, break,--

   And heal it if it be.
     __________________________________________________________________

[115]CCXXIX


   Hark, my soul! it is the LORD;

   'Tis thy Saviour,--hear His word;

   JESUS speaks, and speaks to thee,

   'Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me?


   'I deliver'd thee when bound,

   And when bleeding, heal'd thy wound;

   Sought thee wandering, set thee right;

   Turn'd thy darkness into light.


   'Can a woman's tender care

   Cease towards the child she bare?

   Yes, she may forgetful be,

   Yet will I remember thee.


   'Mine is an unchanging love,

   Higher than the heights above,

   Deeper than the depths beneath,

   Free and faithful, strong as death.


   'Thou shalt see My glory soon,

   When the work of grace is done;

   Partner of My throne shalt be;--

   Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me?'


   LORD, it is my chief complaint,

   That my love is weak and faint;

   Yet I love Thee and adore,--

   Oh! for grace to love Thee more!
     __________________________________________________________________

[116]CCXXX


   O LORD, my best desire fulfil,

   And help me to resign

   Life, health, and comfort to Thy will,

   And make Thy pleasure mine.


   Why should I shrink at Thy command,

   Whose love forbids my fears?

   Or tremble at the gracious hand

   That wipes away my tears?


   No, rather let me freely yield

   What most I prize to Thee;

   Who never hast a good withheld,

   Or wilt withhold from me!
     __________________________________________________________________

[117]CCXXXI


   Sometimes a light surprises

   The Christian while he sings;

   It is the LORD who rises

   With healing in His wings:

   When comforts are declining,

   He grants the soul again

   A season of clear shining,

   To cheer it after rain.


   In holy contemplation,

   We sweetly then pursue

   The theme of GOD's salvation,

   And find it ever new:

   Set free from present sorrow,

   We cheerfully can say,

   E'en let the unknown to-morrow

   Bring with it what it may!


   It can bring with it nothing

   But He will bear us through;

   Who gives the lilies clothing

   Will clothe His people too;

   Beneath the spreading heavens

   No creature but is fed;

   And He who feeds the ravens

   Will give His children bread.


   Though vine nor fig-tree neither

   Their wonted fruit shall bear,

   Though all the field should wither,

   Nor flocks nor herds be there:

   Yet GOD the same abiding,

   His praise shall tune my voice;

   For, while in Him confiding,

   I cannot but rejoice.

   To keep the lamp alive,

   With oil we fill the bowl;

   And grace that feeds the soul.


   The LORD's unsparing hand

   Supplies the living stream;

   It is not at our own command,

   But still derived from Him.


   Beware of Peter's word,

   Nor confidently say,

   I never will deny Thee, Lord,'--

   But,--'Grant I never may.'


   Man's wisdom is to seek

   His strength in GOD alone;

   And e'en an Angel would be weak

   Who trusted in his own.

   Far from the world, O LORD, I flee,

   From strife and tumult far;

   From scenes where Satan wages still

   His most successful war.


   The calm retreat, the silent shade,

   With prayer and praise agree;

   And seem by Thy sweet bounty made

   For those who follow Thee.


   There, if Thy Spirit touch the soul,

   And grace her mean abode,

   Oh! with what peace, and joy, and love,

   She communes with her GOD!


   There, like the nightingale, she pours

   Her solitary lays;

   Nor asks a witness of her song,

   Nor thirsts for human praise.


   Author and guardian of my life,

   Sweet source of light divine,

   And--all harmonious names in one--

   My Saviour! Thou art mine!


   What thanks I owe Thee, and what love,

   A boundless, endless store,

   Shall echo through the realms above,

   When time shall be no more.

   O Thou unknown, Almighty Cause

   Of all my hope and fear!

   In Whose dread presence, ere an hour,

   Perhaps I must appear!


   If I have wander'd in those paths

   Of life I ought to shun;

   As something, loudly in my breast,

   Remonstrates I have done;


   Thou know'st that Thou hast forméd me

   With passions wild and strong;

   And listening to their witching voice

   Has often led me wrong.


   Where human weakness has come short,

   Or frailty stept aside,

   Do Thou, All-Good! for such Thou art,

   In shades of darkness hide.


   Where with intention I have err'd,

   No other plea I have

   But, Thou art good; and Goodness still

   Delighteth to forgive.

   Sweet dreams, form a shade

   O'er my lovely infant's head!

   Sweet dreams of pleasant streams

   By happy, silent, moony beams!


   Sweet sleep, with soft down

   Weave thy brows an infant crown!

   Sweet sleep, angel mild,

   Hover o'er my happy child!


   Sweet babe, in thy face

   Holy image I can trace;

   Sweet babe, once like thee

   Thy Maker lay, and wept for me!


   Wept for me, for thee, for all,

   When He was an Infant small.

   Thou His image ever see [184] ,

   Heavenly face that smiles on thee!


   Smiles on thee, on me, on all,

   Who became an Infant small;

   Infant smiles like His own smile

   Heaven and earth to peace beguile.

   Can I see another's woe,

   And not be in sorrow too?

   Can I see another's grief,

   And not seek for kind relief?


   Can I see a falling tear,

   And not feel my sorrow's share?

   Can a father see his child

   Weep, nor be with sorrow fill'd?


   Can a mother sit and hear

   An infant groan, an infant fear!

   No, no! never can it be!

   Never, never can it be!


   And can He, who smiles on all,

   Hear the wren, with sorrows small,

   Hear the small bird's grief and care,

   Hear the woes that infants bear?


   And not sit beside the nest

   Pouring Pity in their breast?

   And not sit the cradle near

   Weeping tear on infant's tear?


   And not sit both night and day,

   Wiping all our tears away?

   Oh, no! never can it be!

   Never, never can it be!


   He doth give His joy to all:

   He becomes an infant small,

   He becomes a Man of woe,

   He doth feel the sorrow too.


   Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,

   And thy Maker is not by:

   Think not thou canst weep a tear,

   And thy Maker is not near.


   Oh! He gives to us His joy

   That our griefs He may destroy:

   Till our grief is fled and gone

   He doth sit by us and moan.

   Little lamb, who made thee?

   Dost thou know who made thee?

   Gave thee life, and bade thee feed

   By the stream and o'er the mead;

   Gave thee clothing of delight,

   Softest clothing, woolly bright;

   Gave thee such a tender voice,

   Making all the vales rejoice?

   Little lamb, who made thee?

   Dost thou know Who made thee?


   Little lamb, I'll tell thee;

   Little lamb, I'll tell thee;

   He is calléd by thy name

   For He calls Himself a Lamb.

   He is meek and He is mild,

   He became a little child.

   I a child, and thou a lamb,

   We are calléd by His name.

   Little lamb, GOD bless thee!

   The door of death is made of gold,

   In her mild hand the golden keys.

   --The grave is Heaven's golden gate,

   For ever with the LORD!

   Amen! so let it be!

   Life from the dead is in that word,

   And immortality!


   Here in the body pent,

   Absent from Him I roam,

   Yet nightly pitch my moving tent

   A day's march nearer home.


   My Father's house on high,

   Home of my soul! how near,

   At times, to Faith's foreseeing eye,

   Thy golden gates appear!


   Ah! then my spirit faints

   To reach the land I love,

   The bright inheritance of saints,

   Jerusalem above!


   Yet clouds will intervene,

   And all my prospect flies;

   Like Noah's dove, I flit between

   Rough seas and stormy skies.


   Anon the clouds depart,

   The winds and waters cease;

   While sweetly o'er my gladden'd heart

   Expands the bow of peace!


   Beneath its glowing arch,

   Along the hallow'd ground,

   I see cherubic armies march,

   A camp of fire around.


   I hear at morn and even,

   At noon and midnight hour,

   The choral harmonies of Heaven

   Earth's Babel tongues o'erpower.


   Then, then I feel, that He,

   Remember'd or forgot,

   The LORD, is never far from me,

   Though I perceive Him not.

   Abba! Father! give me grace

   Touch my lips, unloose my tongue;

   Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,

   Utter'd, or unexpress'd;

   The motion of a hidden fire

   That trembles in the breast.


   Prayer is the burden of a sigh,

   The falling of a tear;

   The upward glancing of an eye,

   When none but GOD is near.


   Prayer is the simplest form of speech

   That infant lips can try;

   Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach

   The Majesty on high.


   Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice

   Returning from his ways;

   While Angels in their songs rejoice,

   And cry, Behold, he prays!


   Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,

   The Christian's native air;

   His watch-word at the gates of death;

   He enters Heaven with prayer.


   The saints, in prayer, appear as one

   In word, and deed, and mind;

   While with the Father and the Son

   Sweet fellowship they find.


   Nor prayer is made on earth, alone:

   The Holy SPIRIT pleads;

   And JESUS, on the eternal Throne,

   For mourners intercedes.


   O Thou, by Whom we come to GOD,

   The Life, the Truth, the Way!

   The path of prayer Thyself hast trod:

   LORD! teach us how to pray!

   When gathering clouds around I view,

   And days are dark and friends are few,

   On Him I lean, Who not in vain

   Experienced every human pain;

   He sees my wants, allays my fears,

   And counts and treasures up my tears.


   If aught should tempt my soul to stray

   From heavenly wisdom's narrow way;

   To fly the good I would pursue,

   Or do the sin I would not do;

   Still He, Who felt temptation's power,

   Shall guard me in that dangerous hour.


   If wounded love my bosom swell,

   Deceived by those I prized too well;

   He shall His pitying aid bestow,

   Who felt on earth severer woe,--

   At once betray'd, denied, or fled,

   By those who shared His daily bread.


   If vexing thoughts within me rise,

   And, sore dismay'd, my spirit dies;

   Still He, Who once vouchsafed to bear

   The sickening anguish of despair,

   Shall sweetly soothe, shall gently dry,

   The throbbing heart, the streaming eye.


   When sorrowing o'er some stone I bend,

   Which covers what was once a friend,

   And from his voice, his hand, his smile,

   Divides me for a little while;

   Thou, Saviour, mark'st the tears I shed--

   For Thou didst weep o'er Lazarus dead!


   And O! when I have safely past

   Through every conflict but the last;

   Still, still unchanging, watch beside

   My painful bed, for Thou hast died!

   Then point to realms of cloudless day,

   And wipe the latest tear away!

   Praise to GOD, immortal praise,

   Let Thy praise our tongues employ.


   For the blessings of the field,

   For the stores the gardens yield;

   For the vine's exalted juice,

   For the generous olive's use:


   Flocks that whiten all the plain;

   Yellow sheaves of ripen'd grain;

   Clouds that drop their fattening dews,

   Suns that temperate warmth diffuse:


   All that Spring with bounteous hand

   Scatters o'er the smiling land;

   All that liberal Autumn pours

   From her rich o'erflowing stores:


   These to Thee, my GOD, we owe,--

   Source whence all our blessings flow;

   And for these my soul shall raise

   Grateful vows and solemn praise.


   Yet, should rising whirlwinds tear

   From its stem the ripening ear;

   Should the fig-tree's blasted shoot

   Drop her green untimely fruit;


   Should the vine put forth no more,

   Nor the olive yield her store;

   Though the sickening flocks should fall,

   And the herds desert the stall;


   Should Thine alter'd hand restrain

   The early and the latter rain;

   Awake, my soul, lift up thine eyes,

   See where thy foes against thee rise,

   In long array, a numerous host;

   Awake, my soul, or thou art lost!


   Here giant Danger threatening stands,

   Mustering his pale terrific bands;

   There Pleasure's silken banners spread,

   And willing souls are captive led.


   See where rebellious passions rage,

   And fierce desires and lusts engage;

   The meanest foe of all the train

   Has thousands and ten thousands slain!


   Thou tread'st upon enchanted ground,

   Perils and snares beset thee round;

   Beware of all, guard every part,

   But most, the traitor in thy heart.


   Come then, my soul, now learn to wield

   The weight of thine immortal shield;

   Put on the armour from above

   Of heavenly Truth and heavenly Love.


   The terror and the charm repel,

   And powers of earth, and powers of hell;

   The Man of Calvary triumph'd here:

   THE PRIMROSE OF THE ROCK

   W. Wordsworth


   A rock there is whose homely front

   The passing traveller slights;

   Yet there the glow-worms hang their lamps

   Like stars, at various heights;

   And one coy Primrose to that Rock

   The vernal breeze invites.


   What hideous warfare hath been waged,

   What kingdoms overthrown,

   Since first I spied that Primrose-tuft

   And mark'd it for my own;

   A lasting link in Nature's chain

   From highest Heaven let down.


   The flowers, still faithful to the stems,

   Their fellowship renew;

   The stems are faithful to the root,

   That worketh out of view;

   And to the rock the root adheres

   In every fibre true.


   Close clings to earth the living rock,

   Though threatening still to fall;

   The earth is constant to her sphere;

   And GOD upholds them all;

   So blooms this lonely Plant, nor dreads

   Her annual funeral.


   --Here closed the meditative strain;

   But air breathed soft that day,

   The hoary mountain-heights were cheer'd,

   The sunny vale look'd gay;

   And to the Primrose of the Rock

   I gave this after-lay:--


   Sin-blighted though we are, we too,

   The reasoning Sons of Men,

   From one oblivious winter call'd

   Shall rise, and breathe again;

   And in eternal summer lose

   Our threescore years and ten.


   To humbleness of heart descends

   This prescience from on high,

   The Faith that elevates the just,

   Before and when they die;

   And makes each soul a separate heaven,

   A court for Deity.

   Where will they stop, those breathing Powers,

   The Spirits of the new-born flowers?

   They wander with the breeze, they wind

   Where'er the streams a passage find;

   Up from their native ground they rise

   In mute aërial harmonies;

   From humble violet, modest thyme,

   Exhaled, the essential odours climb,

   As if no space below the sky

   Their subtle flight could satisfy:

   Heaven will not tax our thoughts with pride,

   If like ambition be their guide.


   Roused by this kindliest of May-showers,

   The spirit-quickener of the flowers,

   That with moist virtue softly cleaves

   The buds, and freshens the young leaves,

   The birds pour forth their souls in notes

   Of rapture from a thousand throats--

   Here check'd by too impetuous haste,

   While there the music runs to waste

   With bounty more and more enlarged,

   Till the whole air is overcharged;

   --Give ear, O Man! to their appeal,

   And thirst for no inferior zeal,

   Thou, who canst think, as well as feel!


   Mount from the earth; aspire! aspire!

   So pleads the town's cathedral quire,

   In strains that from their solemn height

   Sink, to attain a loftier flight;

   While incense from the altar breathes

   Rich fragrance in embodied wreaths;

   Or, flung from swinging censer, shrouds

   The taper-lights, and curls in clouds

   Around angelic Forms, the still

   Creation of the Painter's skill,

   That on the service wait conceal'd

   One moment, and the next reveal'd.

   --Cast off your bonds, awake, arise,

   And for no transient ecstasies!

   What else can mean the visual plea

   Of still or moving imagery--

   The iterated summons loud,

   Not wasted on the attendant crowd,

   Nor wholly lost upon the throng

   Hurrying the busy streets along?


   Alas! the sanctities combined

   By art to unsensualise the mind,

   Decay and languish; or, as creeds

   And humours change, are spurn'd like weeds:

   The priests are from their altars thrust;

   Temples are levell'd with the dust;

   And solemn rites and awful forms

   Founder amid fanatic storms.

   Yet evermore, through years renew'd

   In undisturb'd vicissitude

   Of seasons balancing their flight

   On the swift wings of day and night,

   Kind Nature keeps a heavenly door

   Wide open for the scatter'd Poor.

   Where flower-breathed incense to the skies

   Is wafted in mute harmonies;

   And ground fresh-cloven by the plough

   Is fragrant with a humbler vow;

   Where birds and brooks from leafy dells

   Chime forth unwearied canticles,

   And vapours magnify and spread

   The glory of the sun's bright head:--

   Still constant in her worship, still

   Conforming to the eternal Will,

   Whether men sow or reap the fields,

   Divine monition Nature yields,

   That not by bread alone we live,

   Or what a hand of flesh can give;

   That every day should leave some part

   Free for a sabbath of the heart:

   So shall the seventh be truly blest,

   From morn to eve, with hallow'd rest.

   IN CATHOLIC SWITZERLAND


   Doom'd as we are our native dust

   To wet with many a bitter shower,

   It ill befits us to disdain

   The altar, to deride the fane,

   Where simple Sufferers bend, in trust

   To win a happier hour.


   I love, where spreads the village lawn,

   Upon some knee-worn cell to gaze:

   Hail to the firm unmoving Cross,

   Aloft, where pines their branches toss!

   And to the chapel far withdrawn,

   That lurks by lonely ways!


   Where'er we roam,--along the brink

   Of Rhine,--or by the sweeping Po;

   Through Alpine vale, or champain wide,

   Whate'er we look on, at our side

   Be Charity!--to bid us think,

   And feel, if we would know.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCLXI

   HOLY BAPTISM


   Dear be the Church, that, watching o'er the needs

   Of Infancy, provides a timely shower

   Whose virtue changes to a Christian Flower

   A Growth from sinful Nature's bed of weeds!--


   Fitliest beneath the sacred roof proceeds

   The ministration; while parental Love

   Looks on, and Grace descendeth from above

   As the high service pledges now, now pleads.


   There, should vain thoughts outspread their wings and fly

   To meet the coming hours of festal mirth,

   The tombs--which hear and answer that brief cry,

   The Infant's notice of his Second Birth,--

   Recal the wandering Soul to sympathy

   With what man hopes from Heaven, yet fears from Earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCLXII

   WITHIN KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL


   Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,

   With ill-match'd aims the Architect who plann'd--

   Albeit labouring for a scanty band

   Of white-robed Scholars only--this immense

   And glorious Work of fine intelligence!

   Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore

   Of nicely-calculated less or more;

   --So deem'd the man who fashion'd for the sense

   These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof

   Self-poised, and scoop'd into ten thousand cells,

   Where light and shade repose, where music dwells

   Lingering--and wandering on as loth to die;

   Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof

   That they were born for immortality.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCLXIII

   A LESSON


   Glory to GOD! and to the Power Who came

   In Filial duty, clothed with love divine,

   That made His human tabernacle shine

   Like Ocean burning with purpureal flame;

   Or like the Alpine Mount, that takes its name

   From roseate hues, far kenn'd at morn and even,

   In hours of peace, or when the storm is driven

   Along the nether region's rugged frame!


   Earth prompts,--Heaven urges; let us seek the light,

   Studious of that pure intercourse begun

   When first our infant brows their lustre won;


   So, like the Mountain, may we grow more bright

   From unimpeded commerce with the Sun,

   At the approach of all-involving night.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCLXIV


   It is a beauteous evening, calm and free;

   The holy time is quiet as a Nun

   Breathless with adoration; the broad sun

   Is sinking down in its tranquillity;


   The gentleness of heaven is on the Sea:

   Listen! the mighty Being is awake,

   And doth with his eternal motion make

   A sound like thunder--everlastingly.


   Dear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,

   If thou appear untouch'd by solemn thought,

   Thy nature is not therefore less divine:


   Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year,

   And worship'st at the Temple's inner shrine,

   GOD being with thee when we know it not.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCLXV


   Not seldom, clad in radiant vest,

   Deceitfully goes forth the Morn;

   Not seldom Evening in the west

   Sinks smilingly forsworn.


   The smoothest seas will sometimes prove

   To the confiding Bark, untrue;

   And if she trust the stars above,

   They can be treacherous too.


   But Thou art true, incarnate LORD,

   Who didst vouchsafe for man to die;

   Thy smile is sure, Thy plighted word

   No change can falsify!


   I bent before Thy gracious throne,

   And ask'd for peace on suppliant knee;

   And peace was given,--nor peace alone,

   But Faith sublimed to ecstasy!

   THE TWO WORLDS

   J. Keble

   See [129]Note


   There is a book, who runs may read,

   Which heavenly truth imparts,

   And all the lore its scholars need,

   Pure eyes and Christian hearts.


   The works of GOD above, below,

   Within us and around,

   Are pages in that book, to show

   How GOD Himself is found.


   The glorious sky embracing all

   Is like the Maker's love,

   Wherewith encompass'd, great and small

   In peace and order move.


   The Moon above, the Church below,

   A wondrous race they run,

   But all their radiance, all their glow,

   Each borrows of its Sun.


   The Saviour lends the light and heat

   That crowns His holy hill;

   The saints, like stars, around His seat,

   Perform their courses still.


   The saints above are stars in Heaven--

   What are the saints on earth?

   Like trees they stand whom GOD has given,

   Our Eden's happy birth.


   Faith is their fix'd unswerving root,

   Hope their unfading flower,

   Fair deeds of charity their fruit,

   The glory of their bower.


   The dew of Heaven is like Thy grace,

   It steals in silence down;

   But where it lights, the favour'd place

   By richest fruits is known.


   One Name above all glorious names

   With its ten thousand tongues

   The everlasting sea proclaims,

   Echoing angelic songs.


   The raging Fire, the roaring Wind,

   Thy boundless power display:

   But in the gentler breeze we find

   Thy SPIRIT's viewless way.


   Two worlds are ours: 'tis only Sin

   Forbids us to descry

   The mystic heaven and earth within,

   Plain as the sea and sky.


   Thou, Who hast given me eyes to see

   And love this sight so fair,

   Give me a heart to find out Thee,

   And read Thee every where.
     __________________________________________________________________

[130]CCLXVII


   Where is Thy favour'd haunt, eternal Voice,

   The region of Thy choice,

   Where, undisturb'd by sin and earth, the soul

   Owns Thy entire control!--

   'Tis on the mountain's summit dark and high,

   When storms are hurrying by:

   'Tis 'mid the strong foundations of the earth,

   Where torrents have their birth.


   No sounds of worldly toil ascending there

   Mar the full burst of prayer;

   Lone Nature feels that she may freely breathe,

   And round us and beneath

   Are heard her sacred tones: the fitful sweep

   Of winds across the steep,

   Through wither'd bents--romantic note and clear,

   Meet for a hermit's ear,--


   The wheeling kite's wild solitary cry,

   And, scarcely heard so high,

   The dashing waters when the air is still

   From many a torrent rill

   That winds unseen beneath the shaggy fell,

   Tracked by the blue mist well:

   Such sounds as make deep silence in the heart

   For Thought to do her part,


   'Tis then we hear the voice of GOD within,

   Pleading with care and sin:

   'Child of My love! how have I wearied thee?

   Why wilt thou err from Me?

   Have I not brought thee from the house of slaves,

   Parted the drowning waves,

   And set My saints before thee in the way,

   Lest thou shouldst faint or stray?


   'What? was the promise made to thee alone?

   Art thou th' excepted one?

   An heir of glory without grief or pain?

   O vision false and vain!

   There lies thy cross; beneath it meekly bow;

   It fits thy stature now:

   Who scornful pass it with averted eye,

   'Twill crush them by-and-by.


   'Raise thy repining eyes, and take true measure

   Of thine eternal treasure;

   The Father of thy LORD can grudge thee nought,--

   The world for thee was bought;

   And as this landscape broad--earth, sea, and sky,--

   All centres in thine eye,

   So all GOD does, if rightly understood,

   Shall work thy final good.'

   CITY AND COUNTRY


   Ye hermits blest, ye holy maids,

   The nearest Heaven on earth,

   Who talk with GOD in shadowy glades,

   Free from rude care and mirth;

   To whom some viewless teacher brings

   The secret lore of rural things,

   The moral of each fleeting cloud and gale,

   The whispers from above, that haunt the twilight vale:


   Say, when in pity ye have gazed

   On the wreathed smoke afar,

   That o'er some town, like mist upraised,

   Hung hiding sun and star,--

   Then as ye turn'd your weary eye

   To the green earth and open sky,

   Were ye not fain to doubt how Faith could dwell

   Amid that dreary glare, in this world's citadel?


   But Love's a flower that will not die

   For lack of leafy screen,

   And Christian Hope can cheer the eye

   That ne'er saw vernal green;

   Then be ye sure that Love can bless

   E'en in this crowded loneliness,

   Where ever-moving myriads seem to say,

   Go--thou art nought to us, nor we to thee--away!

   What went ye out to see

   O'er the rude sandy lea,

   Where stately Jordan flows by many a palm,

   Or where Gennesaret's wave

   Delights the flowers to lave,

   That o'er her western slope breathe airs of balm?


   All through the summer night,

   Those blossoms red and bright [185]

   Spread their soft breasts, unheeding, to the breeze

   Like hermits watching still

   Around the sacred hill,

   Where erst our Saviour watch'd upon His knees.


   The Paschal moon above

   Seems like a saint to rove,

   Left shining in the world with CHRIST alone;

   Below, the lake's still face

   Sleeps sweetly in th' embrace

   Of mountains terraced high with mossy stone.


   Here may we sit, and dream

   Over the heavenly theme,

   Till to our soul the former days return;

   Till on the grassy bed,

   Where thousands once He fed,

   The world's incarnate Maker we discern.


   O cross no more the main [186] ,

   Wandering so wild and vain,

   To count the reeds that tremble in the wind,

   On listless dalliance bound,

   Like children gazing round,

   Who on GOD's works no seal of Godhead find:--


   Bask not in courtly bower,

   Or sun-bright hall of power,

   Pass Babel quick, and seek the holy land--

   From robes of Tyrian dye

   Turn with undazzled eye

   To Bethlehem's glade, or Carmel's haunted strand.


   Or choose thee out a cell

   In Kedron's storied dell,

   Beside the springs of Love, that never die;

   Among the olives kneel

   The chill night-blast to feel,

   And watch the Moon that saw thy Master's agony.


   Then rise at dawn of day,

   And wind thy thoughtful way,

   Where rested once the Temple's stately shade,--

   With due feet tracing round

   The city's northern bound,

   To th' other holy garden, where the LORD was laid.


   --Who thus alternate see

   His death and victory,

   Rising and falling as on angel wings,

   They, while they seem to roam,

   Draw daily nearer home,--

   Their heart untravell'd still adores the King of kings.

   'Tis true, of old th' unchanging sun

   His daily course refused to run,

   The pale moon hurrying to the west

   Paused at a mortal's call to aid

   Th' avenging storm of war, that laid

   Seven guilty realms at once on earth's defiléd breast.


   But can it be, one suppliant tear

   Should stay the ever-moving sphere?

   A sick man's lowly-breathéd sigh,

   When from the world he turns away,

   And hides his weary eyes to pray,

   Should change your mystic dance, ye wanderers of the sky?


   We too, O LORD, would fain command,

   As then, Thy wonder-working hand,

   And backward force the waves of Time,

   That now so swift and silent bear

   Our restless bark from year to year;

   Help us to pause and mourn to Thee our tale of crime.


   Bright hopes, that erst the bosom warm'd,

   And vows, too pure to be perform'd,

   And prayers blown wide by gales of care;--

   These, and such faint half-waking dreams,

   Like stormy lights on mountain streams,

   Wavering and broken all, athwart the conscience glare.


   How shall we 'scape th' o'erwhelming Past?

   Can spirits broken, joys o'ercast,

   And eyes that never more may smile:--

   Can these th' avenging bolt delay,

   Or win us back one little day

   The bitterness of death to soften and beguile?


   Father and Lover of our souls!

   Though darkly round Thine anger rolls,

   Thy sunshine smiles beneath the gloom,--

   Thou seek'st to warn us, not confound;

   Thy showers would pierce the harden'd ground,

   And win it to give out its brightness and perfume.


   Thou smil'st on us in wrath, and we,

   E'en in remorse, would smile on Thee;

   The tears that bathe our offer'd hearts

   We would not have them stain'd and dim,

   But dropp'd from wings of seraphim,

   All glowing with the light accepted love imparts.


   Time's waters will not ebb, nor stay,

   Power cannot change them, but Love may;

   What cannot be, Love counts it done.

   Deep in the heart, her searching view

   Can read where Faith is fix'd and true,

   Through shades of setting life can see Heaven's work begun.


   O Thou, who keep'st the Key of Love,

   Open Thy fount, eternal Dove,

   And overflow this heart of mine,

   Enlarging as it fills with Thee,

   Till in one blaze of charity

   Care and remorse are lost, like motes in light divine;


   Till, as each moment wafts us higher,

   By every gush of pure desire,

   And high-breathed hope of joys above,

   By every secret sigh we heave,

   Whole years of folly we outlive,

   In His unerring sight, who measures Life by Love.

   I mark'd a rainbow in the north,

   What time the wild autumnal sun

   From his dark veil at noon look'd forth,

   As glorying in his course half done,

   Flinging soft radiance far and wide

   Over the dusky heaven and bleak hill-side.


   It was a gleam to Memory dear,--

   And as I walk and muse apart,

   When all seems faithless round and drear

   I would revive it in my heart,

   And watch how light can find its way

   To regions farthest from the fount of day.


   Light flashes in the gloomiest sky,

   And Music in the dullest plain,--

   For there the lark is soaring high

   Over her flat and leafless reign,

   And chanting in so blithe a tone,

   It shames the weary heart to feel itself alone.


   Brighter than rainbow in the north,

   More cheery than the matin lark,

   Is the soft gleam of Christian worth,

   Which on some holy house we mark;

   Dear to the pastor's aching heart

   To think, where'er he looks, such gleam may have a part;


   May dwell, unseen by all but Heaven,

   Like diamond blazing in the mine;

   For, ever, where such grace is given,

   It fears in open day to shine,

   Lest the deep stain it owns within

   Break out, and Faith be shamed by the believer's sin,


   In silence and afar they wait,

   To find a prayer their LORD may hear:

   Voice of the poor and desolate,

   You best may bring it to His ear!

   Your grateful intercessions rise

   With more than royal pomp, and pierce the skies.


   Happy the soul, whose precious cause

   You in the Sovereign Presence plead--

   'This is the lover of Thy laws,

   The friend of Thine in fear and need'--

   For to the poor Thy mercy lends

   That solemn style, 'Thy nation and Thy friends.'


   He too is blest, whose outward eye

   The graceful lines of art may trace

   While his free spirit, soaring high,

   Discerns the glorious from the base;

   Till out of dust his magic raise

   A home for prayer and love, and full harmonious praise.


   Where far away and high above,

   In maze on maze the trancéd sight

   Strays, mindful of that heavenly love

   Which knows no end in depth or height,

   While the strong breath of Music seems

   To waft us ever on, soaring in blissful dreams.


   What though in poor and humble guise

   Thou here didst sojourn cottage-born?

   Yet from Thy glory in the skies

   Our earthly gold Thou dost not scorn:--

   For Love delights to bring her best,

   And where Love is, that offering evermore is blest.


   Love on the Saviour's dying head

   Her spikenard drops unblamed may pour,

   May mount His cross, and wrap Him dead

   In spices from the golden shore;

   Risen, may embalm His sacred name

   With all a Painter's art, and all a Minstrel's flame.


   Worthless and lost our offerings seem,--

   Drops in the ocean of His praise;

   But Mercy with her genial beam

   Is ripening them to pearly blaze,

   To sparkle in His crown above,

   Who welcomes here a child's as there an angel's love.

   Red o'er the forest peers the setting sun,

   The line of yellow light dies fast away

   That crown'd the eastern copse: and chill and dun

   Falls on the moor the brief November day.


   Now the tired hunter winds a parting note,

   And Echo bids good-night from every glade;

   Yet wait awhile, and see the calm leaves float

   Each to his rest beneath their parent shade.


   How like decaying life they seem to glide!

   And yet no second spring have they in store,

   But where they fall, forgotten to abide

   Is all their portion, and they ask no more.


   Soon o'er their heads blithe April airs shall sing,

   A thousand wild-flowers round them shall unfold,

   The green buds glisten in the dews of Spring,

   And all be vernal rapture as of old.


   Unconscious they in waste oblivion lie,--

   In all the world of busy life around

   No thought of them; in all the bounteous sky

   No drop, for them, of kindly influence found.


   Man's portion is to die and rise again--

   Yet he complains, while these unmurmuring part

   With their sweet lives, as pure from sin and stain,

   As his when Eden held his virgin heart.


   And haply half unblamed his murmuring voice

   Might sound in Heaven, were all his second life

   Only the first renew'd--the heathen's choice,

   A round of listless joy and weary strife.


   For dreary were this earth, if earth were all,

   Tho' brighten'd oft by dear Affection's kiss;--

   Who for the spangles wears the funeral pall?

   But catch a gleam beyond it, and 'tis bliss.


   Heavy and dull this frame of limbs and heart,

   Whether slow creeping on cold earth, or borne

   On lofty steed, or loftier prow, we dart

   O'er wave or field: yet breezes laugh to scorn


   Our puny speed, and birds, and clouds in heaven,

   And fish, like living shafts that pierce the main,

   And stars that shoot through freezing air at even--

   Who but would follow, might he break his chain?


   And thou shalt break it soon; the grovelling worm

   Shall find his wings, and soar as fast and free

   As his transfigured LORD with lightning form

   And snowy vest--such grace He won for thee,


   When from the grave He sprang at dawn of morn,

   And led through boundless air thy conquering road,

   Leaving a glorious track, where saints, new-born,

   Might fearless follow to their blest abode.


   But first, by many a stern and fiery blast

   The world's rude furnace must thy blood refine,

   And many a gale of keenest woe be pass'd,

   Till every pulse beat true to airs divine,


   Till every limb obey the mounting soul,--

   The mounting soul, the call by JESUS given:--

   He Who the stormy heart can so control,

   The laggard body soon will waft to Heaven.

   THE REDEMPTION OF NATURE


   Sin is with man at morning-break,

   And through the live-long day

   Deafens the ear that fain would wake

   To Nature's simple lay.


   But when eve's silent foot-fall steals

   Along the eastern sky,

   And one by one to earth reveals

   Those purer fires on high,


   When one by one each human sound

   Dies on the awful ear,

   Then Nature's voice no more is drown'd,

   She speaks, and we must hear.


   Then pours she on the Christian heart

   That warning still and deep,

   At which high spirits of old would start

   E'en from their Pagan sleep,


   Just guessing, through their murky blind,

   --Few, faint, and baffling sight--

   Streaks of a brighter heaven behind,

   A cloudless depth of light.


   Such thoughts, the wreck of Paradise,

   Through many a dreary age,

   Upbore whate'er of good and wise

   Yet lived in bard or sage:


   They mark'd what agonizing throes

   Shook the great mother's womb;

   But Reason's spells might not disclose

   The gracious Birth to come;


   Nor could th' enchantress Hope forecast

   GOD's secret love and power;

   The travail pangs of Earth must last

   Till her appointed hour;


   The hour that saw from opening heaven

   Redeeming glory stream,

   Beyond the summer hues of even,

   Beyond the mid-day beam.


   Thenceforth, to eyes of high desire,

   The meanest things below,

   As with a seraph's robe of fire

   Invested, burn and glow:


   The rod of Heaven has touch'd them all,

   The word from Heaven is spoken;

   'Rise, shine, and sing, thou captive thrall:

   Are not thy fetters broken?


   'The GOD Who hallow'd thee and blest,

   Pronouncing thee all good--

   Hath He not all thy wrongs redrest,

   And all thy bliss renew'd?


   'Why mourn'st thou still as one bereft,

   Now that th' eternal Son

   His blesséd home in Heaven hath left

   To make thee all His own?'
     __________________________________________________________________

CCLXXIV


   When Nature tries her finest touch,

   Weaving her vernal wreath,

   Mark ye, how close she veils her round,

   Not to be traced by sight or sound,

   Nor soil'd by ruder breath?


   Who ever saw the earliest rose

   First open her sweet breast?

   Or, when the summer sun goes down,

   The first soft star in evening's crown

   Light up her gleaming crest?


   Fondly we seek the dawning bloom

   On features wan and fair,--

   The gazing eye no change can trace,

   But look away a little space,

   Then turn, and lo! 'tis there.


   But there's a sweeter flower than e'er

   Blush'd on the rosy spray--

   A brighter star, a richer bloom

   Than e'er did western heaven illume

   At close of summer day.


   'Tis Love, the last best gift of Heaven;

   Love gentle, holy, pure;

   But tenderer than a dove's soft eye,

   The searching sun, the open sky,

   She never could endure.


   So still and secret is her growth,

   Ever the truest heart,

   Where deepest strikes her kindly root

   For hope or joy, for flower or fruit

   Least knows its happy part.


   E'en human Love will shrink from sight

   Here in the coarse rude earth:

   How then should rash intruding glance

   Break in upon her sacred trance

   Who boasts a heavenly birth?


   No--let the dainty rose awhile

   Her bashful fragrance hide--

   Rend not her silken veil too soon,

   But leave her, in her own soft noon,

   To flourish and abide.

   O LORD my GOD, do Thou Thy holy will--

   I will lie still--

   I will not stir, lest I forsake Thine arm,

   And break the charm,

   Which lulls me, clinging to my Father's breast,

   In perfect rest.


   Come, Self-devotion, high and pure,

   Thoughts that in thankfulness endure,

   Though dearest hopes are faithless found,

   And dearest hearts are bursting round.

   Come, Resignation, spirit meek,

   And let me kiss thy placid cheek,

   And read in thy pale eye serene

   Their blessing, who by faith can wean

   Their hearts from sense, and learn to love

   GOD only, and the joys above.


   They say [187] , who know the life divine,

   And upward gaze with eagle eyne,

   That by each golden crown on high,

   Rich with celestial jewelry,

   Which for our LORD's redeem'd is set,

   There hangs a radiant coronet,

   All gemm'd with pure and living light,

   Too dazzling for a sinner's sight,

   Prepared for virgin souls, and them

   Who seek the martyr's diadem.


   Nor deem, who to that bliss aspire,

   Must win their way through blood and fire.

   The writhings of a wounded heart

   Are fiercer than a foeman's dart.

   Oft in Life's stillest shade reclining,

   In Desolation unrepining,

   Without a hope on earth to find

   A mirror in an answering mind,

   Meek souls there are, who little dream

   Their daily strife an Angel's theme,

   Or that the rod they take so calm

   Shall prove in Heaven a martyr's palm.


   And there are souls that seem to dwell

   Above this earth--so rich a spell

   Floats round their steps, where'er they move,

   From hopes fulfill'd and mutual love.

   Such, if on high their thoughts are set,

   Nor in the stream the source forget,

   If prompt to quit the bliss they know,

   Following the Lamb where'er He go,

   By purest pleasures unbeguiled

   To idolize or wife or child;

   Such wedded souls our GOD shall own

   For faultless virgins round His throne.

   SEMPER IDEM


   Strange to our ears the church-bells of our home;

   The fragrance of our old paternal fields

   May be forgotten; and the time may come

   When the babe's kiss no sense of pleasure yields

   E'en to the doting mother: but Thine own

   Thou never canst forget, nor leave alone.


   There are who sigh that no fond heart is theirs,

   None loves them best--O vain and selfish sigh!

   Out of the bosom of His love He spares--

   The Father spares the Son, for thee to die:

   For thee He died--for thee He lives again:

   O'er thee He watches in His boundless reign.


   Thou art as much His care, as if beside

   Nor man nor angel lived in Heaven or earth:

   Thus sunbeams pour alike their glorious tide

   To light up worlds, or wake an insect's mirth:

   They shine and shine with unexhausted store--

   Thou art thy Saviour's darling--seek no more.

   LORD of my heart, by Thy last cry,

   Let not Thy blood on earth be spent--

   Lo, at Thy feet I fainting lie,

   Mine eyes upon Thy wounds are bent,

   Upon Thy streaming wounds my weary eyes

   Wait like the parchéd earth on April skies.


   Wash me, and dry these bitter tears,--

   O let my heart no further roam,

   'Tis Thine by vows, and hopes, and fears,

   Long since--O call Thy wanderer home;

   To that dear home, safe in Thy wounded side,

   Where only broken hearts their sin and shame may hide.

   EPHPHATHA


   The Son of GOD in doing good

   Was fain to look to Heaven and sigh:

   And shall the heirs of sinful blood

   Seek joy unmix'd in charity?

   GOD will not let Love's work impart

   Full solace, lest it steal the heart;

   Be thou content in tears to sow,

   Blessing, like JESUS, in thy woe.


   The deaf may hear the Saviour's voice,

   The fetter'd tongue its chain may break;

   But the deaf heart, the dumb by choice,

   The laggard soul, that will not wake,

   The guilt that scorns to be forgiven;--

   These baffle e'en the spells of Heaven;

   In thought of these, His brows benign

   Not e'en in healing cloudless shine.


   No eye but His might ever bear

   To gaze all down that drear abyss,

   Because none ever saw so clear

   The shore beyond of endless bliss:

   The giddy waves so restless hurl'd,

   The vex'd pulse of this feverish world,

   He views and counts with steady sight,

   Used to behold the Infinite.


   But that in such communion high

   He hath a fount of strength within,

   Sure His meek heart would break and die,

   O'erburthen'd by His brethren's sin:

   --LORD, by Thy sad and earnest eye,

   When Thou didst look to Heaven and sigh;

   Thy voice, that with a word could chase

   The dumb, deaf spirit from his place;


   As Thou hast touch'd our ears, and taught

   Our tongues to speak Thy praises plain,

   Quell Thou each thankless godless thought

   That would make fast our bonds again.

   From worldly strife, from mirth unblest,

   Drowning Thy music in the breast,

   From foul reproach, from thrilling fears,

   Preserve, good LORD, Thy servants' ears.


   From idle words, that restless throng

   And haunt our hearts when we would pray,

   From Pride's false chime, and jarring wrong,

   Seal Thou my lips, and guard the way:

   For Thou hast sworn, that every ear,

   Willing or loth, Thy trump shall hear,

   And every tongue unchainéd be

   To own no hope, no GOD, but Thee.

   Wish not, dear friends, my pain away--

   Wish me a wise and thankful heart,

   With GOD, in all my griefs, to stay,

   Nor from His loved correction start.


   The dearest offering He can crave

   His portion in our souls to prove,

   What is it to the gift He gave,

   The only Son of His dear love?


   But we, like vex'd unquiet sprights,

   Will still be hovering o'er the tomb,

   Where buried lie our vain delights,

   Nor sweetly take a sinner's doom.


   In Life's long sickness evermore

   Our thoughts are tossing to and fro;

   We change our posture o'er and o'er [188] ,

   But cannot rest, nor cheat our woe.


   Were it not better to lie still,

   Let Him strike home and bless the rod,

   Never so safe as when our will

   Yields undiscern'd by all but GOD?


   Thy precious things, whate'er they be,

   That haunt and vex thee, heart and brain,

   Look to the Cross, and thou shalt see

   How thou may'st turn them all to gain.


   Lovest thou praise? the Cross is shame:

   Or ease? the Cross is bitter grief:

   More pangs than tongue or heart can frame

   Were suffer'd there without relief.


   We of that Altar would partake,

   But cannot quit [189] the cost--no throne

   Is ours, to leave for Thy dear sake--

   We cannot do as Thou hast done.


   We cannot part with Heaven for Thee--

   Yet guide us in Thy track of love:

   Let us gaze on where light should be,

   Though not a beam the clouds remove.


   So wanderers ever fond and true

   Look homeward through the evening sky,

   Without a streak of heaven's soft blue

   To aid Affection's dreaming eye.


   The wanderer seeks his native bower,

   And we will look and long for Thee,

   And thank Thee for each trying hour,

   Wishing, not struggling, to be free.

   Why should we faint and fear to live alone,

   Since all alone, so Heaven has will'd, we die,

   Nor e'en the tenderest heart, and next our own,

   Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh?


   Each in his hidden sphere of joy or woe

   Our hermit spirits dwell, and range apart,

   Our eyes see all around in gloom or glow--

   Hues of their own, fresh borrow'd from the heart.


   And well it is for us our GOD should feel

   Alone our secret throbbings: so our prayer

   May readier spring to Heaven, nor spend its zeal

   On cloud-born idols of this lower air.


   For if one heart in perfect sympathy

   Beat with another, answering love for love,

   Weak mortals, all entranced, on earth would lie,

   Nor listen for those purer strains above.


   Or what if Heaven for once its searching light

   Lent to some partial eye, disclosing all

   The rude bad thoughts, that in our bosom's night

   Wander at large, nor heed Love's gentle thrall?


   Who would not shun the dreary uncouth place?

   As if, fond leaning where her infant slept,

   A mother's arm a serpent should embrace:

   So might we friendless live, and die unwept.


   Then keep the softening veil in mercy drawn,

   Thou Who canst love us, tho' Thou read us true;

   As on the bosom of th' aërial lawn

   Melts in dim haze each coarse ungentle hue.


   Thou know'st our bitterness--our joys are Thine--

   No stranger Thou to all our wanderings wild:

   Nor could we bear to think, how every line

   Of us, Thy darken'd likeness and defiled,


   Stands in full sunshine of Thy piercing eye,

   But that Thou call'st us Brethren: sweet repose

   Is in that word--the LORD who dwells on high

   Knows all, yet loves us better than He knows.

   Ave Maria! blesséd Maid!

   Lily of Eden's fragrant shade,

   Who can express the love

   That nurtured thee so pure and sweet,

   Making thy heart a shelter meet

   For JESUS' holy Dove?


   Ave Maria! Mother blest,

   To whom, caressing and caress'd,

   Clings the Eternal Child;

   Favour'd beyond Archangels' dream,

   When first on thee with tenderest gleam

   Thy new-born Saviour smiled:--


   Ave Maria! thou whose name

   All but adoring love may claim,

   Yet may we reach thy shrine;

   For He, thy Son and Saviour, vows

   To crown all lowly lofty brows

   With love and joy like thine.


   Bless'd is the womb that bare Him--bless'd

   The bosom where His lips were press'd;

   But rather bless'd are they

   Who hear His word and keep it well,

   The living homes where CHRIST shall dwell,

   And never pass away.

   THE PURIFICATION


   Bless'd are the pure in heart,

   For they shall see our GOD;

   The secret of the LORD is theirs,

   Their soul is CHRIST's abode.


   --Might mortal thought presume

   To guess an angel's lay,

   Such are the notes that echo through

   The courts of Heaven to-day.


   Such the triumphal hymns

   On Sion's Prince that wait,

   In high procession passing on

   Towards His temple-gate.


   Give ear, ye kings--bow down

   Ye rulers of the earth--

   This, this is He; your Priest by grace,

   Your GOD and King by birth.


   No pomp of earthly guards

   Attends with sword and spear,

   And all-defying, dauntless look,

   Their monarch's way to clear;


   Yet are there more with Him

   Than all that are with you--

   The armies of the highest Heaven,

   All righteous, good and true.


   Spotless their robes and pure,

   Dipp'd in the sea of light,

   That hides the unapproachéd shrine

   From men's and angels' sight.


   His throne, thy bosom blest,

   O Mother undefiled--

   That throne, if aught beneath the skies,

   Beseems the sinless child.


   Lost in high thoughts, 'whose son

   The wondrous Babe might prove,'

   Her guileless husband walks beside,

   Bearing the hallow'd dove;


   Meet emblem of His vow,

   Who, on this happy day,

   His dove-like soul--best Sacrifice--

   Did on God's altar lay.


   But who is he, by years

   Bow'd, but erect in heart,

   Whose prayers are struggling with his tears?

   'LORD, let me now depart.


   'Now hath Thy servant seen

   Thy saving health, O LORD;

   'Tis time that I depart in peace,

   According to Thy word.'


   Yet swells the pomp: one more

   Comes forth to bless her GOD:

   Full fourscore years, meek widow, she

   Her heaven-ward way hath trod.


   She who to earthly joys

   So long had given farewell,

   Now sees, unlook'd for, Heaven on earth,

   CHRIST in His Israel.


   Wide open from that hour

   The temple-gates are set,

   And still the saints rejoicing there

   The holy Child have met.


   --Now count His train to-day,

   And who may meet Him, learn:

   Him child-like sires, meek maidens find,

   Where pride can nought discern.


   Still to the lowly soul

   He doth Himself impart,

   And for His cradle and His throne

   Chooseth the pure in heart.

   BEATI QUI NON VIDERUNT


   We were not by when JESUS came;

   But round us, far and near,

   We see His trophies, and His name

   In choral echoes hear.

   In a fair ground our lot is cast,

   As in the solemn week that past,

   While some might doubt, but all adored,

   Ere the whole widow'd Church had seen her risen LORD.


   Then, gliding through th' unopening door,

   Smooth without step or sound,

   'Peace to your souls,' He said--no more--

   They own Him, kneeling round.

   Eye, ear, and hand, and loving heart,

   Body and soul in every part,

   Successive made His witnesses that hour,

   Cease not in all the world to shew His saving power.


   --Is there, on earth, a spirit frail,

   Who fears to take their word,

   Scarce daring, through the twilight pale,

   To think he sees the LORD?

   With eyes too tremblingly awake

   To bear with dimness for His sake?

   Read and confess the Hand Divine

   That drew thy likeness here so true in every line.


   For all thy rankling doubts so sore,

   Love thou thy Saviour still,

   Him for thy LORD and GOD adore,

   And ever do His will.

   Though vexing thoughts may seem to last,

   Let not thy soul be quite o'ercast,--

   Soon will He shew thee all His wounds, and say,

   'Long have I known thy name--know thou My face alway.'

   THE CONVERSION OF S. PAUL


   The mid-day sun, with fiercest glare,

   Broods o'er the hazy, twinkling air;

   Along the level sand

   The palm-tree's shade unwavering lies,

   Just as thy towers, Damascus, rise

   To greet yon wearied band.


   The leader of that martial crew

   Seems bent some mighty deed to do,

   So steadily he speeds,

   With lips firm closed and fixéd eye,

   Like warrior when the fight is nigh,

   Nor talk nor landscape heeds.


   What sudden blaze is round him pour'd,

   As though all Heaven's refulgent hoard

   In one rich glory shone?

   One moment--and to earth he falls:

   What voice his inmost heart appals?--

   Voice heard by him alone;--


   For to the rest both words and form

   Seem lost in lightning and in storm,

   While Saul, in wakeful trance,

   Sees deep within that dazzling field

   His persecuted LORD reveal'd

   With keen yet pitying glance:


   And hears the meek upbraiding call

   As gently on his spirit fall,

   As if th' Almighty Son

   Were prisoner yet in this dark earth,

   Nor had proclaim'd His royal birth,

   Nor His great power begun.


   'Ah! wherefore persecut'st thou Me?'

   He heard and saw, and sought to free

   His strain'd eye from the sight:

   But Heaven's high magic bound it there,

   Still gazing, though untaught to bear

   Th' insufferable light.


   'Who art Thou, LORD?' he falters forth:--

   So shall Sin ask of heaven and earth

   At the last awful day.

   When did we see Thee suffering nigh,

   And pass'd Thee with unheeding eye?

   Great GOD of judgment, say!'


   Ah! little dream our listless eyes

   What glorious presence they despise,

   While, in our noon of life,

   To power or fame we rudely press:--

   CHRIST is at hand, to scorn or bless,

   CHRIST suffers in our strife.


   And though heaven-gate long since have closed,

   And our dear LORD in bliss reposed,

   High above mortal ken,

   To every ear in every land

   (Though meek ears only understand)

   He speaks as He did then.


   'Ah! wherefore persecute ye Me?

   'Tis hard, ye so in love should be

   With your own endless woe.

   Know, though at GOD's right hand I live,

   I feel each wound ye reckless give

   To the least saint below.


   'I in your care My brethren left,

   Not willing ye should be bereft

   Of waiting on your LORD.

   The meanest offering ye can make--

   A drop of water--for love's sake

   In Heaven, be sure, is stored.'


   O by those gentle tones and dear,

   When Thou hast stay'd our wild career,

   Thou only hope of souls,

   Ne'er let us cast one look behind,

   But in the thought of JESUS find

   What every thought controls.


   As to Thy last Apostle's heart

   Thy lightning glance did then impart

   Zeal's never-dying fire,

   So teach us on Thy shrine to lay

   Our hearts, and let them day by day

   Intenser blaze and higher.


   And as each mild and winning note

   (Like pulses that round harp-strings float

   When the full strain is o'er)

   Left lingering on his inward ear

   Music, that taught, as death drew near,

   Love's lesson more and more:


   So, as we walk our earthly round,

   Still may the echo of that sound

   Be in our memory stored:

   'Christians! behold your happy state:

   CHRIST is in these, who round you wait;

   Make much of your dear LORD!'

   HOLY BAPTISM


   Where is it mothers learn their love?--

   In every Church a fountain springs

   O'er which th' eternal Dove

   Hovers on softest wings.


   What sparkles in that lucid flood

   Is water, by gross mortals eyed:

   But seen by Faith, 'tis blood

   Out of a dear Friend's side.


   A few calm words of faith and prayer,

   A few bright drops of holy dew,

   Shall work a wonder there

   Earth's charmers never knew.


   O happy arms, where cradled lies,

   And ready for the LORD's embrace,

   That precious sacrifice,

   The darling of His grace!


   Blest eyes, that see the smiling gleam

   Upon the slumbering features glow,

   When the life-giving stream

   Touches the tender brow:


   Or when the holy cross is sign'd,

   And the young soldier duly sworn

   With true and fearless mind

   To serve the Virgin-born.


   But happiest ye, who seal'd and blest

   Back to your arms your treasure take,

   With JESUS' mark impress'd

   To nurse for JESUS' sake:


   To whom--as if in hallow'd air

   Ye knelt before some awful shrine--

   His innocent gestures wear

   A meaning half divine:


   By whom Love's daily touch is seen

   In strengthening form and freshening hue,

   In the fix'd brow serene,

   The deep yet eager view.--


   Who taught thy pure and even breath

   To come and go with such sweet grace?

   Whence thy reposing Faith,

   Though in our frail embrace?


   O tender gem, and full of Heaven!

   Not in the twilight stars on high,

   Not in moist flowers at even

   See we our GOD so nigh.


   Sweet one, make haste and know Him too,

   Thine own adopting Father love,

   That like thine earliest dew

   Thy dying sweets may prove.

   CATECHISM


   Oh! say not, dream not, heavenly notes

   To childish ears are vain,

   That the young mind at random floats,

   And cannot reach the strain.


   Dim or unheard, the words may fall,

   And yet the heaven-taught mind

   May learn the sacred air, and all

   The harmony unwind.


   Was not our LORD a little child,

   Taught by degrees to pray,

   By father dear and mother mild

   Instructed day by day?


   And loved He not of Heaven to talk

   With children in His sight,

   To meet them in His daily walk,

   And to His arms invite?


   What though around His throne of fire

   The everlasting chant

   Be wafted from the seraph choir

   In glory jubilant?


   Yet stoops He, ever pleased to mark

   Our rude essays of love,

   Faint as the pipe of wakening lark,

   Heard by some twilight grove:


   Yet is He near us, to survey

   These bright and order'd files,

   Like spring-flowers in their best array,

   All silence and all smiles.


   Save that each little voice in turn

   Some glorious truth proclaims,

   What sages would have died to learn,

   Now taught by cottage dames.


   And if some tones be false or low,

   What are all prayers beneath

   But cries of babes, that cannot know

   Half the deep thought they breathe?


   In His own words we CHRIST adore,

   But angels, as we speak,

   Higher above our meaning soar

   Than we o'er children weak:


   And yet His words mean more than they,

   And yet He owns their praise:

   Why should we think, He turns away

   From infants' simple lays?

   And oft as sin and sorrow tire,

   The hallow'd hour do Thou renew,

   When beckon'd up the awful choir

   By pastoral hands, toward Thee we drew;


   When trembling at the sacred rail

   We hid our eyes and held our breath,

   Felt Thee how strong, our hearts how frail,

   And long'd to own Thee to the death.


   For ever on our souls be traced

   MORNING


   Hues of the rich unfolding morn,

   That, ere the glorious sun be born,

   By some soft touch invisible

   Around his path are taught to swell;--


   Thou rustling breeze so fresh and gay,

   That dancest forth at opening day,

   And brushing by with joyous wing,

   Wakenest each little leaf to sing;--


   Ye fragrant clouds of dewy steam,

   By which deep grove and tangled stream

   Pay, for soft rains in season given,

   Their tribute to the genial heaven;--


   Why waste your treasures of delight

   Upon our thankless, joyless sight;

   Who day by day to sin awake,

   Seldom of Heaven and you partake?


   Oh! timely happy, timely wise,

   Hearts that with rising morn arise!

   Eyes that the beam celestial view,

   Which evermore makes all things new!


   New every morning is the love

   Our wakening and uprising prove;

   Through sleep and darkness safely brought,

   Restored to life, and power, and thought.


   New mercies, each returning day,

   Hover around us while we pray;

   New perils past, new sins forgiven,

   New thoughts of GOD, new hopes of Heaven.


   If on our daily course our mind

   Be set to hallow all we find,

   New treasures still, of countless price,

   GOD will provide for sacrifice.


   Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,

   As more of Heaven in each we see:

   Some softening gleam of love and prayer

   Shall dawn on every cross and care.


   As for some dear familiar strain

   Untired we ask, and ask again,

   Ever, in its melodious store,

   Finding a spell unheard before;


   Such is the bliss of souls serene,

   When they have sworn, and stedfast mean,

   Counting the cost, in all t' espy

   Their GOD, in all themselves deny.


   O could we learn that sacrifice,

   What lights would all around us rise!

   How would our hearts with wisdom talk

   Along Life's dullest dreariest walk!


   We need not bid, for cloister'd cell,

   Our neighbour and our work farewell,

   Nor strive to wind ourselves too high

   For sinful man beneath the sky:


   The trivial round, the common task,

   Would furnish all we ought to ask;

   Room to deny ourselves; a road

   To bring us, daily, nearer GOD.


   Seek we no more; content with these,

   Let present Rapture, Comfort, Ease,

   As Heaven shall bid them, come and go:--

   The secret this of Rest below.


   Only, O LORD, in Thy dear love

   Fit us for perfect Rest above;

   And help us, this and every day,

   To live more nearly as we pray.

   EVENING


   'Tis gone, that bright and orbéd blaze,

   Fast fading from our wistful gaze;

   Yon mantling cloud has hid from sight

   The last faint pulse of quivering light.


   In darkness and in weariness

   The traveller on his way must press,

   No gleam to watch on tree or tower,

   Whiling away the lonesome hour.


   Sun of my soul! Thou Saviour dear,

   It is not night if Thou be near:

   Oh! may no earth-born cloud arise

   To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.


   When round Thy wondrous works below

   My searching rapturous glance I throw,

   Tracing out Wisdom, Power, and Love,

   In earth or sky, in stream or grove;--


   Or by the light Thy words disclose

   Watch Time's full river as it flows,

   Scanning Thy gracious Providence,

   Where not too deep for mortal sense:--


   When with dear friends sweet talk I hold,

   And all the flowers of life unfold;

   Let not my heart within me burn,

   Except in all I Thee discern.


   When the soft dews of kindly sleep

   My wearied eyelids gently steep,

   Be my last thought, how sweet to rest

   For ever on my Saviour's breast.


   Abide with me from morn till eve,

   For without Thee I cannot live:

   Abide with me when night is nigh,

   For without Thee I dare not die.


   Thou Framer of the light and dark,

   Steer through the tempest Thine own ark:

   Amid the howling wintry sea

   We are in port if we have Thee.


   The Rulers of this Christian land,

   'Twixt Thee and us ordain'd to stand,--

   Guide Thou their course, O LORD, aright,

   Let all do all as in Thy sight.


   Oh! by Thine own sad burthen, borne

   So meekly up the hill of scorn,

   Teach Thou Thy Priests their daily cross

   To bear as Thine, nor count it loss!


   If some poor wandering child of Thine

   Have spurn'd, to-day, the voice divine,

   Now, LORD, the gracious work begin;

   Let him no more lie down in sin.


   Watch by the sick: enrich the poor

   With blessings from Thy boundless store:

   Be every Mourner's sleep to-night

   Like infants' slumbers, pure and light.


   Come near and bless us when we wake,

   Ere through the world our way we take;

   Till in the ocean of Thy love

   We lose ourselves in Heaven above.

   THE KINGDOM OF GOD

   R. C. Trench


   I say to thee, do thou repeat

   To the first man thou mayest meet

   In lane, highway, or open street--


   That he and we and all men move

   Under a canopy of love,

   As broad as the blue sky above;


   That doubt and trouble, fear and pain

   And anguish, all are shadows vain,

   That death itself shall not remain;


   That weary deserts we may tread,

   A dreary labyrinth may thread,

   Through dark ways underground be led;


   Yet, if we will one Guide obey,

   The dreariest path, the darkest way

   Shall issue out in heavenly day;


   And we, on divers shores now cast,

   Shall meet, our perilous voyage past,

   All in our Father's house at last.

   What, many times I musing ask'd, is Man,

   If grief and care

   Keep far from him? he knows not what he can,

   What cannot bear.


   He, till the fire hath proved him, doth remain

   The main part dross:

   To lack the loving discipline of pain

   Were endless loss.


   Yet when my LORD did ask me on what side

   I were content

   The grief, whereby I must be purified,

   To Me were sent,


   As each imagined anguish did appear,

   Each withering bliss,

   Before my soul, I cried, 'Oh! spare me here;

   Oh no, not this!'--


   Like one that having need of, deep within,

   The surgeon's knife,

   Would hardly bear that it should graze the skin,

   Though for his life:--


   Till He at last, Who best doth understand

   Both what we need,

   And what can bear, did take my case in hand,

   Nor crying heed.

   Oh thou of dark forebodings drear,

   Oh thou of such a faithless heart,

   Hast thou forgotten what thou art,

   That thou hast ventured so to fear?


   No weed on ocean's bosom cast,

   Borne by its never-resting foam

   This way and that, without a home,

   Till flung on some bleak shore at last:


   But thou the lotus, which above

   Sway'd here and there by wind and tide,

   Yet still below doth fix'd abide,

   Fast rooted in the eternal Love.

   DUST TO DUST


   Oh blessing, wearing semblance of a curse,

   We fear thee, thou stern sentence!--yet to be

   Link'd to immortal bodies were far worse

   Than thus to be set free.


   For mingling with the life-blood through each vein

   The venom of the serpent's bite has run,

   And only thus might be expell'd again--

   Thus only health be won.


   Shall we not then a gracious sentence own,

   Now since the leprosy has fretted through

   The entire house, that Thou wilt take it down,

   And build it all anew?


   Build it this time (since Thou wilt build again),

   A holy house, where righteousness may dwell;

   And we, though in the unbuilding there be pain,

   Will still affirm,--'tis well.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCXCIV


   This did not once so trouble me,

   That better I could not love Thee;

   But now I feel and know

   That only when we love, we find

   How far our hearts remain behind

   The love they should bestow.


   While we had little care to call

   On Thee, and scarcely pray'd at all,

   We seem'd enough to pray:

   But now we only think with shame,

   How seldom to Thy glorious Name

   Our lips their offerings pay.


   And when we gave yet slighter heed

   Unto our brother's suffering need,

   Our hearts reproach'd us then

   Not half so much as now, that we

   With such a careless eye can see

   The woes and wants of men.


   In doing is this knowledge won,

   To see what yet remains undone;

   With this our pride repress,

   And give us grace, a growing store,

   That day by day we may do more,

   And may esteem it less.

   THE GUESTEN HOUSE


   LORD, weary of a painful way,

   All night our heads we would not lay

   Under the naked sky;

   But ask, who worthiest? who will best

   Entreat a tired and lowly guest

   With promptest courtesy?


   And Thou art worthiest; there will not

   One loving usage be forgot

   By Thee; Thy kiss will greet

   Us entering; Thou wilt not disdain

   To wash away each guilty stain

   From off our soiléd feet.


   We enter, from this time to prove

   Thy hospitality and love

   Shown tow'rd Thy meanest guest:

   From house to house we would not stray,

   For whither should we go away?

   With Thee is perfect rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER


   If we with earnest effort could succeed

   To make our life one long connected prayer,

   As lives of some perhaps have been and are:

   If never leaving Thee, we had no need

   Our wandering spirits back again to lead

   Into Thy presence, but continued there,

   Like angels standing on the highest stair

   Of the sapphire throne,--this were to pray indeed.


   But if distractions manifold prevail,

   And if in this we must confess we fail,

   Grant us to keep at least a prompt desire,

   Continual readiness for prayer and praise,

   An altar heap'd and waiting to take fire

   With the least spark, and leap into a blaze.

CCXCVII

   HERE AND HEREAFTER


   To leave unseen so many a glorious sight,

   To leave so many lands unvisited,

   To leave so many worthiest books unread,

   Unrealized so many visions bright;--


   Oh! wretched yet inevitable spite

   Of our brief span, that we must yield our breath,

   And wrap us in the unfeeling coil of death,

   So much remaining of unproved delight!


   But hush, my soul, and vain regrets, be still'd;

   Find rest in Him who is the complement

   Of whatsoe'er transcends our mortal doom,

   Of baffled hope and unfulfill'd intent;

   In the clear vision and aspéct of Whom

   All longings and all hopes shall be fulfill'd.

   Thou inevitable Day,

   When a voice to me shall say,

   'Thou must rise and come away;


   'All thine other journeys past,

   Gird thee, and make ready fast

   For thy longest and thy last':--


   Day deep-hidden from our sight

   In impenetrable night,

   Who may guess of thee aright?


   Art thou distant, art thou near?

   Wilt thou seem more dark or clear?

   Day with more of hope or fear?


   Wilt thou come, unseen before

   Thou art standing at the door,

   Saying, light and life are o'er?


   Or with such a gradual pace,

   As shall leave me largest space

   To regard thee face to face?


   Shall I lay my drooping head

   On some loved lap,--round my bed

   Prayer be made and tears be shed?


   Or at distance from mine own,

   Name and kin alike unknown,

   Make my solitary moan?


   Will there yet be things to leave,

   Hearts to which this heart must cleave,

   From which parting it must grieve?


   Or shall life's best ties be o'er,

   And all loved ones gone before

   To that other happier shore?


   Shall I gently fall on sleep,

   Death, like slumber, o'er me creep,

   Like a slumber sweet and deep?


   Or the soul long strive in vain,

   To escape, with toil and pain,

   From its half-divided chain?


   Little skills it where or how,

   If thou comest then or now,

   With a smooth or angry brow;


   Come thou must, and we must die--

   JESUS! Saviour! stand Thou by,

   When that last sleep seals our eye!

   H. Alford


   In token that thou shalt not fear

   CHRIST Crucified to own,

   We print the Cross upon thee here,

   And stamp thee His alone.


   In token that thou shalt not blush

   To glory in His Name,

   We blazon here upon thy front

   His glory and His shame.


   In token that thou shalt not flinch

   CHRIST's quarrel to maintain,

   But 'neath His banner manfully

   Firm at thy post remain;


   In token that thou too shalt tread

   The path He travell'd by,

   Endure the cross, despise the shame,

   And sit thee down on high;


   Thus, outwardly and visibly,

   We seal thee for His own;

   And may the brow that wears His Cross

   Hereafter share His Crown!

   Be not afraid to pray--to pray is right.

   Pray, if thou canst, with hope; but ever pray,

   Though hope be weak, or sick with long delay;

   Pray in the darkness, if there be no light.


   Far is the time, remote from human sight,

   When war and discord on the earth shall cease;

   Yet every prayer for universal peace

   Avails the blesséd time to expedite.


   Whate'er is good to wish, ask that of Heaven,

   Though it be what thou canst not hope to see;

   Pray to be perfect, though material leaven

   Forbid the spirit so on earth to be:


   But if for any wish thou darest not pray,

   Then pray to GOD to cast that wish away.

   She sat and wept beside His feet; the weight

   Of sin oppress'd her heart; for all the blame,

   And the poor malice of the worldly shame,

   To her was past, extinct, and out of date:


   Only the sin remain'd,--the leprous state;

   She would be melted by the heat of love,

   By fires far fiercer than are blown to prove

   And purge the silver ore adulterate.


   She sat and wept, and with her untress'd hair

   Still wiped the feet she was so blest to touch;

   And He wiped off the soiling of despair

   From her sweet soul, because she loved so much.


   I am a sinner, full of doubts and fears,--

   Make me a humble thing of love and tears!

   In stature perfect, and with every gift

   Which GOD would on His favourite work bestow,

   Did our great Parent his pure form uplift,

   And sprang from earth, the lord of all below.


   But Adam fell before a child was born,

   And want and weakness with his fall began;

   So his first offspring was a thing forlorn,

   In human shape, without the strength of man.


   So, Heaven has doom'd that all of Adam's race,

   Naked and helpless shall their course begin,--

   E'en at their birth confess their need of grace--

   And weeping, wail the penalty of sin.


   Yet sure the babe is in the cradle blest,

   Since GOD Himself a baby deign'd to be--

   And slept upon a mortal Mother's breast,

   And steep'd in baby tears His Deity.


   --O sleep, sweet infant, for we all must sleep,

   And wake like babes, that we may wake with Him,

   Who watches still His own from harm to keep,

   And o'er them spreads the wings of Cherubim.

   MORNING THOUGHTS

   H. F. Lyte


   Again, O LORD, I ope my eyes

   Thy glorious light to see,

   And share the gifts so largely lent

   To thankless man by Thee.


   And why has GOD o'er me this night

   The watch so kindly kept?

   And why have I so safely waked,

   And why so sweetly slept?


   And wherefore do I live and breathe?

   And wherefore have I still

   The mind to know, the sense to choose,

   The strength to do Thy will?


   Is it, to waste another day

   In folly, sin, and shame?

   To give to these my heart and hand,

   And spurn my Maker's claim?


   Is it, for honour, wealth, or power

   My heavenly hopes to sell?

   Is it, to grasp at pleasure's flower

   Upon the brink of hell?


   Is it, to grow unto the world,

   As glides the world from me;

   Be one day nearer to the grave,

   And further, LORD, from Thee?


   No! thus too many days I've spent!

   To Thee, then, this be given:

   Teach what I owe to Man below,

   And to Thyself in heaven.

   THE ALPS


   Hail, scenes of holy grandeur! hail!

   Where mortal sense stands hush'd and awed:--

   Oh, who could gaze on such, and fail

   To think of Thee, my GOD?


   Alone and dread Thou dwellest here,

   The Source and Soul of all I see.

   I look around in joy and fear,

   And feel I am with Thee!


   I see Thee on the mountain sit,

   At summer's noon, sublime and still;

   Or, in the giant shadows flit

   Along from hill to hill.


   I read Thy presence and Thy power

   In each eternal rock I meet;

   I trace Thy love in every flower

   That blossoms at my feet.


   Thou speakest from each rolling cloud

   That pours its stormy mirth on high,

   When cliff to cliff is shouting loud,

   Responsive to the sky:--


   Thy voice at night is in the sound

   Of sinking glaciers, rushing rills,

   And avalanches thundering round

   Among the startled hills:--


   The mountain-mists in all their moods,

   The snows by earthly feet untrod,--

   The fells, the forests, and the floods,

   Are all instinct with GOD.

   All lamp'd with stars, and curtain'd round

   With clouds of every hue,


   Earth is His altar: Nature there

   Her daily tribute pays;

   The elements upon Him wait;

   The seasons roll His praise.


   Where shall I see Him? How describe

   The Dread, Eternal One?

   His foot-prints are in every place,

   Himself is found in none.


   He call'd the world, and it arose;

   The heavens and they appear'd;

   His hand pour'd forth the mighty deep;

   His arm the mountains rear'd.


   He sets His foot upon the hills,

   And earth beneath Him quakes;

   He walks upon the hurricane,

   And in the thunder speaks.


   --I search the rounds of space and time,

   Nor find His semblance there--

   Grandeur has nothing so sublime,

   Nor Beauty half so fair.

   A FALLEN SISTER


   She is not dead--she only sleeps:

   Life in her soul its vigil keeps:

   Though dark the cloud, though strong the chain,

   Speak, LORD, and she shall live again!


   She is not dead:--it cannot be

   That one whose soul so glow'd to Thee,

   Should all that's past renounce, forget:

   Oh, speak, and she will hear Thee yet!


   I know, I know how once she felt,

   Have seen her spirit mount and melt;

   Have join'd with her in praise and prayer;

   And cannot, dare not, yet despair.


   She that has fed on heavenly food,

   Conversed with all that's great and good,

   Can she descend from heights like these

   To the poor worldling's husks and lees?


   She, that has bent at Heaven's high throne,

   And claim'd its glories for her own,

   An earthworm here again to crawl?--

   She cannot long so deeply fall.


   I know how many for her feel,

   And plead with Thee to come and heal:

   I know the power of faith and prayer,

   And cannot, will not, yet despair.


   Sunk as she is in thoughtless sin,

   Thou hast a still, small voice within--

   A silent hold--a hidden plea--

   That needs but quickening, LORD, from Thee.


   A look of Thine can life impart;

   A tone of Thine can touch the heart:

   The very grave Thy voice must hear:

   Oh, bid it reach our sister's ear!


   Press on her soul each pang and scorn,

   Which Thou for her of old hast borne;

   And ask how she will dare to meet

   Thy face upon a judgment-seat.


   Talk to her heart, and bid her feel;

   Send forth Thy word to wound and heal;

   Melt off her spirit's icy chain,

   And bid her rise and live again,


   She is not dead:--Thy voice Divine

   Can still revive, and seal her Thine;

   And 'neath Thy wing she yet may dwell,

   More meek, more safe, than ere she fell.

   How speak of heavenly joy and trust,

   Till I have felt them more?


   An heir of guilt, a child of sin,

   An exile in a world like this,

   What should I find without, within,

   To match with Him and His?


   In vain I spread my flickering wings;

   In vain I strive aloft to flee:

   Great LORD of lords, and KING of kings,

   I cannot sing of Thee!


   I want a Seraph's lofty voice,

   I want a Seraph's soaring wing,

   Before I make such themes my choice,

   And GOD's dread glories sing.


   Thou needest not a note of mine

   To swell the triumphs of Thy throne,

   Where myriads round Thee bend and shine,

   And Heaven is all Thy own!


   No rather let me sit and sigh,

   And drop contrition's silent tear:

   Praise is the task of saints on high;

   But prayer of sinners here.


   The song of GOD, that glorious song,--

   From me in such a world as this?--

   O no! a worthier heart and tongue

   Must speak of Him and His!

   Why do I sigh to find

   Life's evening shadows gathering round my way?

   The keen eye dimming, and the buoyant mind

   Unhinging day by day?


   Is it the natural dread

   Of that stern lot, which all who live must see?

   The worm, the clay, the dark and narrow bed,--

   Have these such awe for me?


   As nears my soul the verge

   Of this dim continent of woe and crime,

   Shrinks she to hear Eternity's long surge

   Break on the shores of Time?


   I want not vulgar fame--

   I seek not to survive in brass or stone;

   Hearts may not kindle when they hear my name,

   Nor tears my value own--


   But might I leave behind

   Some blessing for my fellows, some fair trust

   To guide, to cheer, to elevate my kind,

   When I was in the dust;--


   Within my narrow bed

   Might I not wholly mute or useless be;

   But hope that they, who trampled o'er my head,

   Drew still some good from me;--


   Might verse of mine inspire

   One virtuous aim, one high resolve impart;

   Light in one drooping soul a hallow'd fire,

   Or bind one broken heart;--


   Death would be sweeter then,

   More calm my slumber 'neath the silent sod,--

   Might I thus live to bless my fellow-men,

   Or glorify my God!


   --Why do we ever lose

   As judgment ripens, our diviner powers?

   Why do we only learn our gifts to use

   When they no more are ours?


   O Thou! whose touch can lend

   Life to the dead, Thy quickening grace supply,

   And grant me, swanlike, my last breath to spend

   In [145]song that may not die [193] !

   Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,

   And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,

   Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.

   On to the close, O LORD, abide with me!


   I need Thy presence every passing hour:

   What but Thy grace can foil the Tempter's power?

   Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?

   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!


   I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless:

   Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.

   Where is Death's sting? where, Grave, thy victory?

   --I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.


   Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes;

   Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee:--

   In life and death, O LORD, abide with me!

   LOOKING UP TO THE CROSS

   See [147]Note


   Oft have I read of sunny realms, where skies are pure at even,

   And sight goes deep in lucid air, and earth seems nearer Heaven,

   And wheresoe'er you lift your eyes, the holy Cross, they say,

   Stands guardian of your journey, by lone or crowded way;

   And I have mused how awfully its shadows and its gleams

   Might haply fall on infants' eyes, and mingle with their dreams,

   And draw them up by silent power of its o'ershading arm,

   And deepen on the tender brow CHRIST's seal and saintly charm.


   --Upon a verdant hillock the sacred sign appears,

   A damsel on no trembling arm an eager babe uprears,

   With a sister's yearning love, and an elder sister's pride,

   She lifts the new-baptized, to greet the Friend Who for him died.

   Who may the maiden's thought divine, performing thus in sight

   Of all the heavenly Watchers her pure unbidden rite?

   While fearless to those awful Lips her treasure she would raise,

   I see her features shrink, as though she fain would downward gaze.


   Perchance a breath of self-reproach is fluttering round her heart:--

   'Thou, darling, in our Saviour may'st for certain claim thy part:

   The dews baptismal bright and keen are glistening on thy brow,

   He cannot choose but own thee, in His arms received e'en now.

   But much I've sinn'd and little wept: will He not say, "Begone"?

   I dare not meet His searching eye; my penance is undone.

   But thou and thy good Angel, who nerves mine arm to bear

   And lift thee up so near Him, will strive for me in prayer.'


   Or chanced the Thorny Crown her first upseeking glance to win,

   And the deep lines of agony traced by the whole world's sin?

   Oh, deeply in her bosom went the thought, 'Who draw so nigh

   Unto those awful Lips, and share the LORD's departing sigh,--

   Who knoweth what mysterious pledge upon their souls is bound,

   To copy in their own hearts' blood each keen and bitter Wound?

   If of the dying JESUS we the Kiss of Peace receive

   How but in daily dying thenceforward dare we live?


   'And was it meet, thou tender flower, on thy young life to lay

   Such burden, pledging thee to vows thou never canst unsay?

   What if the martyrs' fire some day thy dainty limbs devour?

   What if beneath the scourge they writhe, or in dull famine cower?

   What if thou bear the cross within, all aching and decay?--

   And 'twas I that laid it on thee:--what if thou fall away?'

   Such is Love's deep misgiving, when stronger far than Faith,

   She brings her earthly darlings to the Cross for life or death.


   O, be Thou present in that hour, high Comforter, to lead

   Her memory to th' eternal Law, by the great King decreed,

   What time the highly favour'd one who on His bosom lay,

   And he who of the chosen twelve first trode the martyr way,

   Taught by their mother, craved the boon next to Thy throne to be,

   For her dreams were of the Glory, but the Cross she could not see.

   O well for that fond mother, well for her beloved, that they,

   When th' hour His secret meaning told, did by their promise stay!


   'Thy baptism and Thy cup be ours: for both our hearts are strong.'

   Learn it, ye babes, at matin prime, repeat it all day long.

   Ev'n as the mother's morning kiss is token of delight

   Through all the merry hours of day, and at fall of dewy night

   Her evening kiss shall to her babe the softest slumbers seal,

   So Thy first greeting life imparts, Thy last shall cheer and heal.--

   Then, maiden, trust thy nursling here! thou wilt not choose amiss

   For his sweet soul; here let him dwell; here is the gate of bliss.

   When travail hours are spent and o'er,

   And genial hours of joy

   In cradle songs and nursery lore

   All the glad home employ,


   Full busy in her kindly mood

   Is Fancy, to descry

   The welcome notes of fatherhood,

   In form, and lip, and eye.


   And elder brethren's hearts are proud,

   And sisters blush and smile,

   As round the babe by turns they crowd

   A brief and wondering while.


   With eager speed they ready make

   Soft bosom and safe arm

   As though such burthen once to take

   A blessing were and charm.


   And ever as with hastening wing

   His little life glides on,

   By power of that first wondrous spring

   To all but babes unknown,


   Easier each hour the task will grow,

   To name the unfolding flower,

   By plumage and by song to know

   The nestling in his bower.--


   Oh, while your hearts so blithely dance

   With frail fond hopes of earth,

   Will ye not cast one onward glance

   To the true heavenly birth?


   Will ye not say, 'GOD speed the time

   When Spirits pure, to trace

   The lines of a more glorious prime,

   Shall lean from their high place,


   'And mark, too keen for earthly day,

   The Father's stamp and seal,

   CHRIST in the heart, the Living Ray,

   Its deepening light reveal?'


   --Oh, well the denizens of Heaven

   Their Masters children know,

   By filial yearnings sweet and even,

   By patient smiles in woe,


   By gaze of meek inquiry, turn'd

   Towards th' informing Eye,

   By tears that to obey have learn'd,

   By claspéd hands on high!

   Give me a tender spotless child,

   Rehearsing or at eve or morn

   His chant of glory undefiled,

   The Creed that with the Church was born:--


   Down be his earnest forehead cast,

   His slender fingers join'd for prayer,

   With half a frown his eye seal'd fast

   Against the world's intruding glare.


   Who,--while his lips so gently move,

   And all his look is purpose strong,

   Can say what wonders, wrought above,

   Upon his unstain'd fancy throng?


   The world new-framed, the CHRIST new-born,

   The Mother-Maid, the cross and grave,

   The rising sun on Easter morn,

   The fiery tongues sent down to save,--


   The gathering Church, the Font of Life,

   The saints and mourners kneeling round,

   The Day to end the body's strife,

   The Saviour in His people crown'd,--


   All in majestic march and even

   To the veil'd eye by turns appear,

   True to their time as stars in heaven,--

   No morning dream so still and clear.

   EXAMPLE


   We scatter seeds with careless hand,

   And dream we ne'er shall see them more:

   But for a thousand years

   Their fruit appears,

   In weeds that mar the land,

   Or healthful store.


   The deeds we do, the words we say,--

   Into still air they seem to fleet,

   We count them ever past;

   But they shall last,

   In the dread judgment they

   And we shall meet!


   --I charge thee by the years gone by,

   For the love's sake of brethren dear,

   Keep thou the one true way

   In work and play,

   Lest in that world their cry

   Of woe thou hear!

   I mark'd when vernal meads were bright,

   And many a primrose smiled,

   I mark'd her, blithe as morning light,

   A dimpled three years' child.


   A basket on one tender arm

   Contain'd her precious store

   Of spring-flowers in their freshest charm,

   Told proudly o'er and o'er.


   The other wound with earnest hold

   About her blooming guide,

   A maid who scarce twelve years had told:

   So walk'd they side by side.


   One a bright bud, and one might seem

   A sister flower half blown.

   Full joyous on their loving dream

   The sky of April shone.


   The summer months swept by: again

   That loving pair I met.

   On russet heath, and bowery lane,

   Th' autumnal sun had set:


   And chill and damp that Sunday eve

   Breathed on the mourners' road

   That bright-eyed little one to leave

   Safe in the Saints' abode.


   Behind, the guardian sister came,

   Her bright brow dim and pale--

   O cheer thee, maiden! in His Name,

   Who still'd Jairus' wail!


   Thou mourn'st to miss the fingers soft

   That held by thine so fast,

   The fond appealing eye, full oft

   Tow'rd thee for refuge cast.


   Sweet toils, sweet cares, for ever gone!

   No more from stranger's face

   Or startling sound, the timid one

   Shall hide in thine embrace.


   Thy first glad earthly task is o'er,

   And dreary seems thy way.

   But what if nearer than before

   She watch thee e'en to-day?


   What if henceforth by Heaven's decree

   She leave thee not alone,

   But in her turn prove guide to thee

   In ways to Angels known?


   O yield thee to her whisperings sweet:

   Away with thoughts of gloom!

   In love the loving spirits greet,

   Who wait to bless her tomb.


   In loving hope with her unseen

   Walk as in hallow'd air.

   When foes are strong and trials keen,

   Think, 'What if she be there?'

   See [149]Note


   Lo, cast at random on the wild sea sand

   A child low wailing lies;

   Around, with eye forlorn and feeble hand,

   Scarce heeding its faint cries,

   The widow'd mother in the wilderness

   Gathers dry boughs, their last sad meal to dress.


   But who is this that comes with mantle rude

   And vigil-wasted air,

   Who to the famish'd cries, 'Come give me food,

   I with thy child would share?'

   She bounteous gives: but hard he seems of heart,

   Who of such scanty store would crave a part.


   Haply the child his little hand holds forth,

   That all his own may be.--

   Nay, simple one, thy mother's faith is worth

   Healing and life to thee.

   That handful given, for years ensures thee bread:

   That drop of oil shall raise thee from the dead.


   For in yon haggard form He begs unseen,

   To Whom for life we kneel:

   One little cake He asks with lowly mien,

   Who blesses every meal.

   Lavish for Him, ye poor, your children's store,

   So shall your cruse for many a day run o'er.


   And thou, dear child, though hungering, give glad way

   To JESUS in His need:

   So thy blest mother at the awful day

   Thy name in Heaven may read;

   So by His touch for ever may'st thou live,

   Who asks our alms, and lends a heart to give.

   Heaven in the depth and height is seen;

   On high among the stars, and low

   In deep clear waters: all between

   Is earth, and tastes of earth: ev'n so

   The Almighty One draws near

   To strongest seraphs there, to weakest infants here.


   GOD's Angels keep the eternal round

   Of praise on high, and never tire.

   His lambs are in His Temple found

   Early, with all their hearts' desire.

   They boast not to be free,--

   They grudge not to their LORD meek ear and bended knee.

   'Tis only our dull hearts that tire so soon

   Of CHRIST's repeated call; while they in Heaven,

   Unwearied basking in the eternal noon,

   Still sound the note, by the first Seraph given,

   What time the Morning Stars around their King

   Began for evermore to shine and sing.


   And you, ye gentle babes, true image here

   Of such as walk in white before the Throne,

   Ye weary not of Love, how oft soe'er

   Her yearnings she repeat in unchanged tone.

   To tale familiar, to remember'd strain,

   To frolic ten times tried, ye cry, Again.


   How have I seen you, when the unpleasing time

   Came for some kindly guest to pass away,

   Cling round his skirts! how mark'd the playful chime

   Of earnest voices, pledged to make him stay!

   O deeply sink, and with a tearful spell,

   The memories of such welcome and farewell.


   Nor wants in elder love the like soft charm.

   The Mother tires not of one little voice,

   Ev'n as she fain all day with patient arm

   Would bear one burthen. O frail heart, rejoice!

   Love trains thee now by repetition sweet

   The unwasting and unvarying bliss to greet.

   CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS EVE


   Rejoice in GOD alway,

   With stars in Heaven rejoice,

   Ere dawn of CHRIST's own day

   Lift up each little voice.

   Look up with glad pure eye,

   And count those lamps on high.

   Nay, who may count them? on our gaze

   They from their deeps come out in ever widening maze.


   Each in his stand aloof

   Prepares his keenest beam,

   Upon that hovel roof,

   In at that door, to stream,

   Where meekly waits her time

   The whole earth's Flower and Prime:--

   Where in few hours the Eternal One

   Will make a clear new day, rising before the sun.


   Rejoice in GOD alway,

   With each green leaf rejoice,

   Of berries on each spray

   The brightest be your choice.

   From bower and mountain lone

   The autumnal hues are gone,

   Yet gay shall be our Christmas wreath,

   The glistening beads above, the burnish'd leaves beneath.


   Rejoice in GOD alway,

   With Powers rejoice on high,

   Who now with glad array

   Are gathering in the sky,

   His cradle to attend

   And there all lowly bend.

   But half so low as He hath bow'd

   Did never highest Angel stoop from brightest cloud.


   Rejoice in GOD alway,

   All creatures, bird and beast,

   Rejoice, again I say,

   His mightiest and His least;

   From ox and ass that wait

   Here on His poor estate,

   To the four living Powers, decreed

   A thousand ways at once His awful car to speed.


   Rejoice in GOD alway:

   With Saints in Paradise

   Your midnight service say,

   For vigil glad arise.

   Ev'n they in their calm bowers

   Too tardy find the hours

   Till He reveal the wondrous Birth:

   How must we look and long, chain'd here to sin and earth!


   Ye babes, to JESUS dear,

   Rejoice in Him alway.

   Ye whom He bade draw near,

   O'er whom He loved to pray,

   Wake and lift up the head

   Each in his quiet bed.

   Listen: His voice the night-wind brings

   He in your cradle lies, He in our carols sings.

   'Nurse, let me draw the baby's veil aside,

   I want to see the Cross upon her brow.'

   Nay, maiden dear, that seal may not abide

   In sight of mortals' ken; 'tis vanish'd now.


   'Alas, for pity! when the holy man

   Said even now, I sign thee with the cross,

   What joy to think that I at home should scan

   The bright, clear lines! O, sad and sudden loss!'


   --Complain not so, my child: no loss is here,

   But endless gain. If thou wilt open wide

   Faith's inward eye, soon shall to thee appear

   What now by wondering angels is descried,


   Thy LORD's true token, seen not, but believed,

   And therefore doubly blest. O, mark it well;

   And be this rule in thy young heart received--

   Blest, who content with Him in twilight dwell.


   Thy saints, O LORD, and Thine own Mother dear

   Are round Thee as a glory-cloud: we see

   The general glow, not each in outline clear,

   Or several station: all are hid in Thee.


   In prayer we own Thee, Father, at our side,

   Not always feel or taste Thee; and 'tis well.

   So, hour by hour, courageous faith is tried;

   So, gladlier will the morn all mists dispel.

   HARVEST


   LORD, in Thy Name Thy servants plead,

   And Thou hast sworn to hear;

   Thine is the harvest, Thine the seed,

   The fresh and fading year:


   Our hope, when Autumn winds blew wild,

   We trusted, LORD, with Thee;

   And still, now Spring has on us smiled,

   We wait on Thy decree.


   The former and the latter rain,

   The summer sun and air,

   The green ear, and the golden grain,--

   All Thine, are ours by prayer.


   Thine too by right, and ours by grace,

   The wondrous growth unseen,

   The hopes that soothe, the fears that brace,

   The love that shines serene.


   So grant the precious things brought forth

   By sun and moon below,

   That Thee in Thy new heaven and earth

   We never may forego.

   ANTIPODES


   Far, far on other isles,

   Where other stars are beaming,

   Where the bright rose on Christmas smiles,

   And Whitsun lights with frost are gleaming,

   Yon kindly Moon, and glorious Sun

   Their race, as here, unwearying run.


   What if all else be strange?

   The two great lights of heaven

   Know neither error, stay, nor change.

   By them all else to sight is given;

   And with them duly, fresh and bright,

   Home thoughts return both day and night.


   Glory to our true Sun,

   Who shineth far and near;

   Who for His duteous Spouse hath won

   A place as of a lunar sphere;

   And by their light, where'er she roam,

   Faith finds a safe, familiar home.

   THE GATHERING OF THE CHURCH


   Wherefore shrink, and say, ''Tis vain;

   In their hour hell-powers must reign;

   Vainly, vainly would we force

   Fatal error's torrent course;

   Earth is mighty, we are frail;

   Faith is gone, and hope must fail.'


   Yet along the Church's sky

   Stars are scatter'd, pure and high;

   Yet her wasted gardens bear

   Autumn violets, sweet and rare--

   Relics of a spring-time clear,

   Earnest of a bright new year.


   Israel yet hath thousands seal'd,

   Who to Baal never kneel'd;

   Seize the banner, spread its fold!

   Seize it with no faltering hold!

   Spread its foldings high and fair,

   Let all see the Cross is there!


   What if to the trumpet's sound

   Voices few come answering round?

   Scarce a votary swell the burst,

   When the anthem peals at first?

   GOD hath sown, and He will reap;

   Growth is slow when roots are deep;--


   He will aid the work begun,

   For the love of His dear Son;

   He will breathe in their true breath,

   Who, serene in prayer and faith,

   Would our dying embers fan

   Bright as when their glow began.

   Our human wills, a tender thread,

   With the strong will divine:--

   We run as we are led.


   We, did I say? 'tis all Thine own;

   Thou in the dark dost Mary guide:

   Thine angel moves the stone;

   Love feels Thee at her side.

   THE COMMUNION OF THE SICK


   Holy is the sick man's room:--

   Temper'd air, and curtain'd gloom,

   Measured steps, and tones as mild

   As the breath of new-born child,

   Postures lowly, waitings still,

   Looks subdued to duty's will,

   Reverent, thoughtful, grave and sweet:

   These to wait on CHRIST are meet.

   These may kneel where He lies low,

   In His members suffering woe.

   Nor in other discipline

   Train we hearts, that to His shrine

   May unblamed draw near, and be

   With His favour'd two or three:--

   Therefore in its silent gloom

   Holy is the sick man's room.

   I thought to meet no more, so dreary seem'd

   Death's interposing veil, and thou so pure,

   Thy place in Paradise

   Beyond where I could soar;


   Friend of this worthless heart! but happier thoughts

   Spring like unbidden violets from the sod,

   Where patiently thou tak'st

   Thy sweet and sure repose.


   The shadows fall more soothing: the soft air

   Is full of cheering whispers like thine own;

   While Memory, by thy grave,

   Lives o'er thy funeral day;


   The deep knell dying down, the mourners' pause,

   Waiting their Saviour's welcome at the gate.--

   Sure with the words of Heaven

   Thy spirit met us there,


   And sought with us along th' accustom'd way

   The hallow'd porch, and entering in, beheld

   The pageant of sad joy

   So dear to Faith and Hope.


   O! hadst thou brought a strain from Paradise

   To cheer us, happy soul, thou hadst not touch'd

   The sacred springs of grief

   More tenderly and true,


   Than those deep-warbled anthems, high and low,

   Low as the grave, high as th' Eternal Throne,

   Guiding through light and gloom

   Our mourning fancies wild,


   'Till gently, like soft golden clouds at eve

   Around the western twilight, all subside

   Into a placid faith,

   That even with beaming eye


   Counts thy sad honours, coffin, bier, and pall;

   So many relics of a frail love lost,

   So many tokens dear

   Of endless love begun.


   Listen! it is no dream: th' Apostles' trump

   Gives earnest of th' Archangel's;--calmly now,

   Our hearts yet beating high

   To that victorious lay,


   (Most like a warrior's, to the martial dirge,

   Of a true comrade), in the grave we trust

   Our treasure for awhile:

   And, if a tear steal down,


   If human anguish o'er the shaded brow

   Pass shuddering, when the handful of pure earth

   Touches the coffin-lid;

   If at our brother's name,


   Once and again the thought, 'for ever gone,'

   Come o'er us like a cloud; yet, gentle spright,

   Thou turnest not away,

   Thou know'st us calm at heart.


   One look, and we have seen our last of thee,

   Till we too sleep and our long sleep be o'er.

   O cleanse us, ere we view

   That countenance pure again,


   THOU, who canst change the heart, and raise the dead!

   As Thou art by to soothe our parting hour,

   Be ready when we meet,

   With Thy dear pardoning words.

   AVE, GRATIA PLENA

   See [157]Note


   Mother of GOD! O, not in vain

   We learn'd of old thy lowly strain.

   Fain in thy shadow would we rest,

   And kneel with thee, and call thee blest;

   With, thee would 'magnify the LORD,'--

   And if thou art not here adored,

   Yet seek we, day by day, the love and fear

   Which bring thee, with all saints, near and more near.


   What glory thou above hast won,

   By special grace of thy dear Son,

   We see not yet, nor dare espy

   Thy crownéd form with open eye.

   Rather beside the manger meek

   Thee bending with veil'd brow we seek;

   Or where the angel in the thrice-great Name

   Hail'd thee, and JESUS to thy bosom came.


   Yearly since then with bitterer cry

   Man hath assail'd the Throne on high,

   And sin and hate more fiercely striven

   To mar the league 'twixt earth and heaven.

   But the dread tie, that pardoning hour,

   Made fast in Mary's awful bower,

   Hath mightier proved to bind than we to break:--

   None may that work undo, that Flesh unmake.


   Thenceforth, Whom thousand worlds adore,

   He calls thee Mother evermore;

   Angel nor Saint His face may see

   Apart from what He took of thee.

   How may we choose but name thy name,

   Echoing below their high acclaim

   In holy Creeds? Since earthly song and prayer

   Must keep faint time to the dread anthem there.


   How, but in love, on thine own days,

   Thou blissful one, upon thee gaze?

   Nay every day, each suppliant hour,

   Whene'er we kneel in aisle or bower,

   Thy glories we may greet unblamed,

   Nor shun the lay by seraphs framed,

   'Hail, Mary, full of grace!' O, welcome sweet,

   Which daily in all lands all saints repeat!


   Therefore as kneeling day by day

   We to our Father duteous pray,

   So unforbidden may we speak

   An Ave to CHRIST's Mother meek:

   (As children with 'good morrow' come

   To elders in some happy home:)

   Inviting so the saintly host above

   With our unworthiness to pray in love.

   THE CHILD'S GREÄVE


   Avore the time when zuns went down

   On zummer's green a-turn'd to brown,

   When sheädes o' swayèn wheat-eärs vell [201]

   Upon the scarlet pimpernel;

   The while you still mid [202] goo, an' vind

   An' when a high day broke, to call

   The mother brought, wi' thoughtvul mind,

   The feärest buds her eyes could vind,

   To trim the little greäve, an' show

   An' meäde a Seävior's little cross

   O' brightest flow'rs that then did blow,

   A-droppèn tears a-sheenèn [205] bright,

   Up where did droop the Seävior's feäce;

   An' two she zet a-bloomèn bright,

   Where reach'd His hands o' left an' right;

   Two mwore feäir blossoms, crimson dyed,

   Did mark the pleäces ov His veet,

   An' woone did lie, a-smellèn sweet,

   Up where the spear did wound the zide

   Ov Him that is the life ov all

   THE MOTHER'S DREAM


   I'd a dream to-night

   As I fell asleep,

   Oh! the touching sight

   Makes me still to weep:

   Of my little lad,

   Gone to leave me sad,

   Aye, the child I had,

   But was not to keep.


   As in heaven high,

   I my child did seek,

   There, in train, came by

   Children fair and meek,

   Each in lily-white,

   With a lamp alight;

   Each was clear to sight,

   But they did not speak.


   Then, a little sad,

   Came my child in turn,

   But the lamp he had,

   Oh! it did not burn;

   He, to clear my doubt,

   Said, half turn'd about,

   'Your tears put it out;

   Mother, never mourn.'

   I do not ask, O LORD, that life may be

   A pleasant road;

   I do not ask that Thou wouldst take from me

   Aught of its load:


   I do not ask that flowers should always spring

   Beneath my feet;

   I know too well the poison and the sting

   Of things too sweet.


   For one thing only, LORD, dear LORD, I plead:

   Lead me aright--

   Though strength should falter and though heart should bleed,

   Through Peace to Light.


   I do not ask, O LORD, that Thou shouldst shed

   Full radiance here:

   Give but a ray of peace, that I may tread

   Without a fear.


   I do not ask my cross to understand,

   My way to see;

   Better in darkness just to feel Thy hand,

   And follow Thee.

   C. G. Rossetti


   This Advent moon shines cold and clear,

   These Advent nights are long,

   Our lamps have burn'd year after year

   And still their flame is strong.

   'Watchman, what of the night?' we cry

   Heart-sick with hope deferr'd:

   'No speaking signs are in the sky,'

   Is still the watchman's word.


   The Porter watches at the gate,

   The servants watch within;

   The watch is long betimes and late,

   The prize is slow to win.

   'Watchman, what of the night?' but still

   His answer sounds the same:

   'No daybreak tops the utmost hill,

   Nor pale our lamps of flame.'


   One to another hear them speak

   The patient Virgins wise:

   'Surely He is not far to seek'--

   'All night we watch and rise.'

   'The days are evil looking back,

   The coming days are dim;

   Yet count we not His promise slack,

   But watch and wait for Him.'


   One with another, soul with soul,

   They kindle fire from fire:

   'Friends watch us who have touch'd the goal.'

   'They urge us, come up higher.'

   'With them shall rest our waysore feet,

   With them is built our home,

   With CHRIST.'--'They sweet, but He most sweet,

   Sweeter than honeycomb.'


   There no more parting, no more pain,

   The distant ones brought near,

   The lost so long are found again,--

   Long lost but longer dear:

   Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard,

   Nor heart conceived that rest,

   With them our good things long deferr'd,

   With JESUS CHRIST our Best.


   We weep because the night is long,

   We laugh, for day shall rise;

   We sing a slow contented song,

   And knock at Paradise.

   Weeping we hold Him fast, Who wept

   For us, we hold Him fast;

   And will not let Him go except

   He bless us first or last.


   Weeping we hold Him fast to-night;

   We will not let Him go

   Till daybreak smite our wearied sight

   And summer smite the snow:

   Then figs shall bud, and dove with dove

   Shall coo the livelong day;

   Then He shall say, 'Arise, My love,

   My fair one, come away.'

   A CHRISTMAS CAROL


   In the bleak mid-winter

   Frosty wind made moan,

   Earth stood hard as iron,

   Water like a stone;

   Snow had fallen, snow on snow,

   Snow on snow,

   In the bleak mid-winter

   Long ago.


   Our GOD, Heaven cannot hold Him,

   Nor earth sustain;

   Heaven and earth shall flee away

   When He comes to reign:

   In the bleak mid-winter

   A stable-place sufficed

   The LORD GOD Almighty

   JESUS CHRIST.


   Enough for Him Whom cherubim

   Worship night and day,

   A breastful of milk

   And a mangerful of hay;

   Enough for Him Whom angels

   Fall down before,

   The ox and ass and camel

   Which adore.


   Angels and archangels

   May have gather'd there,

   Cherubim and seraphim

   Throng'd the air,--

   But only His Mother

   In her maiden bliss

   Worshipp'd the Belovéd

   With a kiss.


   What can I give Him

   Poor as I am?

   If I were a shepherd

   I would bring a lamb;

   If I were a wise man

   I would do my part;

   Yet what I can I give Him,--

   Give my heart.

   DESPISED AND REJECTED


   My sun has set, I dwell

   In darkness as a dead man out of sight;

   And none remains, not one, that I should tell

   To him mine evil plight

   This bitter night.

   I will make fast my door

   That hollow friends may trouble me no more.


   'Friend, open to Me.'--Who is this that calls?

   Nay, I am deaf as are my walls:

   Cease crying, for I will not hear

   Thy cry of hope or fear.

   Others were dear,

   Others forsook me: what art thou indeed

   That I should heed

   Thy lamentable need?

   Hungry, should feed,

   Or stranger, lodge thee here?


   'Friend, My Feet bleed.

   Open thy door to Me and comfort Me.'

   I will not open, trouble me no more.

   Go on thy way footsore,

   I will not rise and open unto thee.

   'Then is it nothing to thee? Open, see

   Who stands to plead with thee.

   Open, lest I should pass thee by, and thou

   One day entreat My Face

   And howl for grace,

   And I be deaf as thou art now.

   Open to Me.'


   Then I cried out upon him: Cease,

   Leave me in peace:

   Fear not that I should crave

   Aught thou may'st have.

   Leave me in peace, yea trouble me no more,

   Lest I arise and chase thee from my door.

   What, shall I not be let

   Alone, that thou dost vex me yet?


   But all night long that voice spake urgently:

   'Open to Me.'

   Still harping in mine ears:

   'Rise, let Me in.'

   Pleading with tears:

   'Open to Me, that I may come to thee.'

   While the dew dropp'd, while the dark hours were cold:

   'My Feet bleed, see my Face,

   See My Hands bleed that bring thee grace,

   My Heart doth bleed for thee,--

   Open to Me.'


   So till the break of day:

   Then died away

   That voice, in silence as of sorrow;

   Then footsteps echoing like a sigh

   Pass'd me by,

   Lingering footsteps slow to pass.

   On the morrow

   I saw upon the grass

   Each footprint mark'd in blood, and on my door

   The mark of blood for evermore.

   Give me the lowest place: not that I dare

   That lowest place too high, make one more low

   FOR THE DESOLATE

   H. S. Sutton


   When thy lone dreams sweet visions see,

   And loving looks upon thee shine,

   And loving lips speak joys to thee

   That never, never may be thine;

   Then press thy hand hard on thy side,

   And force down all the swelling pain;

   Trust me, the wound, however wide,

   Shall close at last, and heal again.


   Think not of what is from thee kept;

   Think, rather, what thou hast received:

   Thine eyes have smiled, if they have wept;

   Thy heart has danced, if it has grieved.

   Rich comforts yet shall be thine own;

   Yea, GOD Himself shall wipe thine eyes;

   And still His love alike is shown

   In what He gives, and what denies.

   How beautiful it is to be alive!

   To wake each morn as if the Maker's grace

   Did us afresh from nothingness derive

   That we might sing 'How happy is our case!

   How beautiful it is to be alive!'


   To read in GOD's great Book, until we feel

   Love for the love that gave it; then to kneel

   Close unto Him Whose truth our souls will shrive,

   While every moment's joy doth more reveal

   How beautiful it is to be alive.


   Rather to go without what might increase

   Our worldly standing, than our souls deprive

   Of frequent speech with GOD, or than to cease

   To feel, through having wasted health or peace,

   How beautiful it is to be alive.


   Not to forget, when pain and grief draw nigh,

   Into the ocean of time past to dive

   For memories of GOD's mercies, or to try

   To bear all sweetly, hoping still to cry

   'How beautiful it is to be alive!'


   Thus ever towards man's height of nobleness

   Strive still some new progression to contrive;

   Till, just as any other friend's, we press

   Death's hand; and, having died, feel none the less

   How beautiful it is to be alive.

   A PREACHER'S SOLILOQUY


   What wealth to earth our GOD hath given!

   What growing increment for heaven!

   Men, women, youth, and children small,

   I thank the good GOD for you all!


   Not always was it mine to give

   Such high regard to all who live;

   Time was, I know, when I could go

   Along the streets and scarcely see

   The presences my GOD did show

   So lavishly to me.

   Around my steps,--before, behind,--

   They His creative power declared;

   I only heeded them, to find

   The easiest path, as on I fared.

   And ev'n the innocent little ones,

   Of value high o'er stars and suns,--

   Evangelists, by Heaven's decree,

   Commission'd truths to teach to me

   That elsewise I had never known,--

   They seem'd young foreigners to be,

   They never seem'd mine own.

   How could I be so dull and blind?

   How dared I slight GOD's humankind?


   I know ye nothing care for me;--

   Each to each deep mysteries,

   We cannot guess what we may be

   Except by what a glance can seize.

   Perchance we never met before,

   Meet now the first and final time,

   Yet are ye mine, over and o'er,

   That, haply, I may help you climb

   To JESUS, up the mount divine.

   Oh might such high success be mine!

   Fain would I couch your vision dim;

   Fain would I lead you up to Him!


   Nay, nay, I cannot yield up one--

   No little child, no youth, no man;

   I cannot say, Depart from me;

   I cannot say, Begone, begone,

   I have no part in thee.


   No part? But how? Do I not love you?

   Is not this title still more strong

   Than if I'd bought you all with gold?--

   Love strenuous flies, a spirit above you;

   Try to escape, it will outfly you,

   It will embrace, ay, and defy you

   To break away its gentle hold.

   Because GOD's love is swift and strong,

   Therefore ye all to me belong.


   Why do I dare love all mankind?

   'Tis not because each face, each form

   Is comely, for it is not so;

   Nor is it that each soul is warm

   With any Godlike glow.

   Yet there's no one to whom's not given

   Some little lineament of heaven,

   Some partial symbol, at the least, in sign

   Of what should be, if it is not, within,

   Reminding of the death of sin

   And life of the Divine.

   There was a time, full well I know,

   When I had not yet seen you so;

   Time was, when few seem'd fair;

   But now, as through the streets I go,

   There seems no face so shapeless, so

   Forlorn, but that there's something there

   That, like the heavens, doth declare

   The glory of the great All-Fair;

   And so mine own each one I call;

   And so I dare to love you all.


   Glory to GOD, who hath assign'd

   To me this mixture with mankind!

   Glory to GOD, that I am born

   Into a world, whose palace-gates

   So many royal ones adorn!

   Heaven's possible novitiates,

   With self-subduing freedom free,

   Princely ye are, each one, to me,

   Each of secret kingly blood,

   Though not inheritors as yet

   Of all your own right royal things;

   For it were folly to forget

   That they alone are queens and kings

   Who are the truly good.

   Yet are ye angels in disguise,

   Angels who have not found your wings;

   I see more in ye than ye are

   As yet, while earth so closely clings;

   As through a cloud that hides the skies

   Undoubting science hails a star

   Not to be seen by other eyes,

   Yet surely among things that are,--

   So the dense veil of your deformities

   Love gives me power away to pull.

   --Alas! why will ye not from sin arise,

   And be CHRIST's beautiful?

   THE TOYS

   C. Patmore


   My little son, who looked from thoughtful eyes,

   And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise,

   Having my law the seventh time disobey'd,

   I struck him, and dismiss'd

   With hard words and unkiss'd;

   His Mother, who was patient, being dead.

   Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,

   I visited his bed,

   But found him slumbering deep,

   With darken'd eyelids, and their lashes yet

   From his late sobbing wet.

   And I, with moan,

   Kissing away his tears, left others of my own;

   For, on a table drawn beside his head,

   He had put, within his reach,

   A box of counters and a red-vein'd stone,

   A piece of glass abraded by the beach

   And six or seven shells,

   A bottle with bluebells,

   And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art,

   To comfort his sad heart.


   So when that night I pray'd

   To GOD, I wept, and said:

   Ah, when at last we lie with trancéd breath,

   Not vexing Thee in death,

   And Thou rememberest of what toys

   We made our joys,

   How weakly understood

   Thy great commanded good,--

   Then, Fatherly not less

   Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay,

   Thou'lt leave Thy wrath, and say,

   'I will be sorry for their childishness.'

   O only Source of all our light and life,

   Whom as our truth, our strength, we see and feel,

   But whom the hours of mortal moral strife

   Alone aright reveal!


   Mine inmost soul, before Thee inly brought,

   Thy presence owns ineffable, divine;

   Chastised each rebel self-encenter'd thought,

   My will adoreth Thine.


   With eye down-dropt, if then this earthly mind

   Speechless remain, or speechless e'en depart;

   Nor seek to see--for what of earthly kind

   Can see Thee as Thou art?--


   If well-assured 'tis but profanely bold

   In thought's abstractest forms to seem to see,

   It dare not dare the dread communion hold

   In ways unworthy Thee:--


   O not unown'd, Thou shalt unnamed forgive;

   In worldly walks the prayerless heart prepare;

   And if in work its life it seem to live,

   Shalt make that work be prayer.


   Nor times shall lack, when while the work it plies,

   Unsummon'd powers the blinding film shall part,

   And scarce by happy tears made dim, the eyes

   In recognition start.


   But, as Thou willest, give or e'en forbear

   The beatific supersensual sight;--

   So, with Thy blessing blest, that humbler prayer

   Approach Thee morn and night.

   Who seeketh finds: what shall be his relief

   Who hath no power to seek, no heart to pray,

   No sense of GOD, but bears as best he may,

   A lonely incommunicable grief?


   What shall he do? One only thing he knows,

   That his life flits a frail uneasy spark

   In the great vast of universal dark,

   And that the grave may not be all repose.


   Be still, sad soul! lift thou no passionate cry,

   But spread the desert of thy being bare

   To the full searching of the All-seeing eye:


   Wait--and through dark misgiving, blank despair,

   GOD will come down in pity, and fill the dry

   Dead place with light, and life, and vernal air.

   SAINTS DEPARTED


   While they here sojourn'd, their presence drew us

   By the sweetness of their human love;

   Day by day good thoughts of them renew us,

   Like fresh tidings from the world above;


   Coming, like the stars at gloamin' glinting

   Through the western clouds, when loud winds cease,

   Silently of that calm country hinting,

   Where they with the angels are at peace.


   Not their own, ah! not from earth was flowing

   That high strain to which their souls were tuned,

   Year by year we saw them inly growing

   Liker Him with Whom their hearts communed.


   Then to Him they pass'd; but still unbroken,

   Age to age, lasts on that goodly line,

   Whose pure lives are, more than all words spoken,

   Earth's best witness to the life divine.


   Subtlest thought shall fail, and learning falter,

   Churches change, forms perish, systems go,

   But our human needs, they will not alter,

   CHRIST no after age shall e'er outgrow.


   Yea, Amen! O changeless One, Thou only

   Art life's guide and spiritual goal,

   Thou the Light across the dark vale lonely,--

   Thou the eternal haven of the soul!

   I have a life with CHRIST to live,

   But, ere I live it, must I wait

   Till learning can clear answer give

   Of this and that book's date?


   I have, a life in CHRIST to live,

   I have a death in CHRIST to die;--

   And must I wait, till science give

   All doubts a full reply?


   Nay rather, while the sea of doubt

   Is raging wildly round about,

   Questioning of life and death and sin,

   Let me but creep within

   Thy fold, O CHRIST, and at Thy feet

   Take but the lowest seat,

   And hear Thine awful voice repeat

   In gentlest accents, heavenly sweet,

   Come unto Me, and rest:

   Believe Me, and be blest.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCL


   'Twixt gleams of joy and clouds of doubt

   Our feelings come and go;

   Our best estate is toss'd about

   In ceaseless ebb and flow.


   No mood of feeling, form of thought,

   Is constant for a day;

   But Thou, O LORD! Thou changest not;

   The same Thou art alway.


   I grasp Thy strength, make it mine own,

   My heart with peace is blest;

   I lose my hold, and then comes down

   Darkness and cold unrest.


   Let me no more my comfort draw

   From my frail hold of Thee,--

   In this alone rejoice with awe;

   Thy mighty grasp of me.


   Out of that weak unquiet drift

   That comes but to depart,

   To that pure Heaven my spirit lift

   Where Thou unchanging art.


   Lay hold of me with Thy strong grasp,

   Let Thy Almighty arm

   In its embrace my weakness clasp,

   And I shall fear no harm.


   Thy purpose of eternal good

   Let me but surely know;

   On this I'll lean, let changing mood

   And feeling come or go;


   Glad when Thy sunshine fills my soul;

   Not lorn when clouds o'ercast;

   Since Thou within Thy sure control

   Of Love dost hold me fast.

   THE POWERS THAT BE ARE ORDAINED OF GOD

   R. H. Froude


   Yes, mark the words, deem not that Saints alone

   Are Heaven's true servants, and His laws fulfil

   Who rules o'er just and wicked. He from ill

   Culls good, He moulds the Egyptian's heart of stone


   To do him honour, and e'en Nero's throne

   Claims as His ordinance; before Him still

   Pride bows unconscious, and the rebel will

   Most does His bidding, following most its own.


   Then grieve not at their high and palmy state,

   Those proud bad men, whose unrelenting sway

   Has shatter'd holiest things, and led astray

   CHRIST's little ones: they are but tools of Fate,

   Duped rebels, doom'd to serve a POWER they hate,

   To earn a traitor's guerdon, yet obey.

   A THANKSGIVING

   J. H. Newman


   LORD, in this dust Thy sovereign voice

   First quicken'd love divine;

   I am all Thine,--Thy care and choice,

   My very praise is Thine.


   I praise Thee, while Thy providence

   In childhood frail I trace,

   For blessings given, ere dawning sense

   Could seek or scan Thy grace;


   Blessings in boyhood's marvelling hour,

   Bright dreams, and fancyings strange;

   Blessings, when reason's awful power

   Gave thought a bolder range;


   Blessings of friends, which to my door

   Unask'd, unhoped, have come;

   And, choicer still, a countless store

   Of eager smiles at home.


   Yet, LORD, in memory's fondest place

   I shrine those seasons sad,

   When, looking up, I saw Thy face

   In kind austereness clad.


   I would not miss one sigh or tear,

   Heart-pang, or throbbing brow;

   Sweet was the chastisement severe,

   And sweet its memory now.


   Yes! let the fragrant scars abide,

   Love-tokens in Thy stead,

   Faint shadows of the spear-pierced side

   And thorn-encompass'd head.


   And such Thy tender force be still,

   When self would swerve or stray,

   Shaping to truth the froward will

   Along Thy narrow way.


   Deny me wealth; far, far remove

   The lure of power or name;

   Hope thrives in straits, in weakness love,

   And faith in this world's shame.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLIII


   In childhood, when with eager eyes

   The season-measured year I view'd,

   All, garb'd in fairy guise,

   Pledged constancy of good.


   Spring sang of heaven; the summer flowers

   Bade me gaze on, and did not fade;

   Ev'n suns o'er autumn's bowers

   Heard my strong wish, and stay'd.


   They came and went, the short-lived four;

   Yet, as their varying dance they wove,

   To my young heart each bore

   Its own sure claim of love.


   Far different now;--the whirling year

   Vainly my dizzy eyes pursue;

   And its fair tints appear

   All blent in one dusk hue.


   Then what this world to thee, my heart?

   Its gifts nor feed thee nor can bless.

   Thou hast no owner's part

   In all its fleetingness.


   The flame, the storm, the quaking ground,

   Earth's joy, earth's terror, nought is thine;

   Thou must but hear the sound

   Of the still Voice Divine.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLIV

   THE SAINT AND THE HERO


   O aged Saint! far off I heard

   The praises of thy name;--

   Thy deed of power, thy prudent word,

   Thy zeal's triumphant flame.


   I came and saw; and, having seen,

   Weak heart, I drew offence

   From thy prompt smile, thy simple mien,

   Thy lowly diligence.


   The Saint's is not the Hero's praise;--

   This I have found, and learn

   Nor to malign Heaven's humblest ways,

   Nor its least boon to spurn.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLV

   TRANSFIGURATION


   I saw thee once, and nought discern'd

   For stranger to admire;

   A serious aspect, but it burn'd

   With no unearthly fire.


   Again I saw, and I confess'd

   Thy speech was rare and high;

   And yet it vex'd my burden'd breast,

   And scared, I knew not why.


   I saw once more, and awe-struck gazed

   On face, and form, and air;

   GOD's living glory round thee blazed--

   A Saint--a Saint was there!

CCCLVI

   PERSECUTION


   Say, who is he in deserts seen,

   Or at the twilight hour?

   Of garb austere, and dauntless mien,

   Measured in speech, in purpose keen,

   Calm as in Heaven he had been,

   Yet blithe when perils lower.


   My Holy Mother made reply,

   'Dear child, it is my Priest.

   The world has cast me forth, and I

   Dwell with wild earth and gusty sky;

   He bears to men my mandates high,

   And works my sage behest.


   'Another day, dear child, and thou

   Shalt join his sacred band.

   Ah! well I deem, thou shrinkest now

   From urgent rule and severing vow;

   Gay hopes flit round, and light thy brow:

   Time hath a taming hand!'

   ST. PHILIP NERI IN HIS SCHOOL


   This is the Saint of gentleness and kindness,

   Cheerful in penance, and in precept winning;

   Patiently healing of their pride and blindness

   Souls that are sinning.


   This is the Saint, who, when the world allures us,

   Cries her false wares, and opes her magic coffers,

   Points to a better city, and secures us

   With richer offers.


   Love is his bond, he knows no other fetter,

   Asks not our all, but takes whate'er we spare him,

   Willing to draw us on from good to better,

   As we can bear him.


   When he comes near to teach us and to bless us,

   Prayer is so sweet, that hours are but a minute;

   Mirth is so pure, though freely it possess us,

   Sin is not in it.


   Thus he conducts by holy paths and pleasant,

   Innocent souls, and sinful souls forgiven,

   Towards the bright palace where our GOD is present,

   Throned in high heaven.

   THE CALL OF DAVID


   Latest born of Jesse's race,

   Wonder lights thy bashful face,

   While the Prophet's gifted oil

   Seals thee for a path of toil.

   We, thy Angels, circling round thee,

   Ne'er shall find thee as we found thee,

   When thy faith first brought us near

   To quell the lion and the bear.


   Go! and mid thy flocks awhile

   At thy doom of greatness smile;

   Bold to bear GOD's heaviest load,

   Dimly guessing of the road,--

   Rocky road, and scarce ascended,

   Though thy foot be angel-tended.


   Twofold praise thou shalt attain,

   In royal court and battle plain;

   Then comes heart-ache, care, distress,

   Blighted hope, and loneliness;

   Wounds from friend and gifts from foe,

   Dizzied faith, and guilt, and woe;

   Loftiest aims by earth defiled,

   Gleams of wisdom sin-beguiled,

   Sated power's tyrannic mood,

   Counsels shared with men of blood;

   Sad success, parental tears,

   And a dreary gift of years.


   Strange, that guileless face and form

   To lavish on the scarring storm!

   Yet we take thee in thy blindness,

   And we buffet thee in kindness;

   Little chary of thy fame,--

   Dust unborn may bless or blame,--

   But we mould thee for the root

   Of man's promised healing Fruit,

   And we mould thee hence to rise,

   As our brother, to the skies.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLIX

   JAMES AND JOHN


   Two brothers freely cast their lot

   With David's royal Son;

   The cost of conquest counting not,

   They deem the battle won.


   Brothers in heart, they hope to gain

   An undivided joy;

   That man may one with man remain,

   As boy was one with boy.


   CHRIST heard; and will'd that James should fall,

   First prey of Satan's rage;

   John linger out his fellows all,

   And die in bloodless age.


   Now they join hands once more above,

   Before the Conqueror's throne;

   Thus GOD grants prayer, but in His love

   Makes times and ways His own.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLX

   FAITH AGAINST SIGHT


   The world has cycles in its course, when all

   That once has been, is acted o'er again:--

   Not by some fated law, which need appal

   Our faith, or binds our deeds as with a chain;

   But by men's separate sins, which, blended still,

   The same bad round fulfil.


   Then fear ye not, though Gallio's scorn ye see,

   And soft-clad nobles count you mad, true hearts!

   These are the fig-tree's signs;--rough deeds must be,

   Trials and crimes: so learn ye well your parts.

   Once more to plough the earth it is decreed,

   And scatter wide the seed.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXI

   SACRILEGE


   The Church shone brightly in her youthful days

   Ere the world on her smiled;

   So now, an outcast, she would pour her rays

   Keen, free, and undefiled:

   Yet would I not that arm of force were mine,

   Which thrusts her from her awful ancient shrine.


   'Twas duty bound each convert-king to rear

   His Mother from the dust,

   And pious was it to enrich, nor fear

   CHRIST for the rest to trust;

   And who shall dare make common or unclean

   What once has on the Holy Altar been?


   Dear brothers!--hence, while ye for ill prepare,

   Triumph is still your own;

   Blest is a pilgrim Church!--yet shrink to share

   The curse of throwing down.

   So will we toil in our old place to stand,

   Watching, not dreading, the despoiler's hand.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXII

   VEXATIONS


   Each trial has its weight; which, whoso bears

   Knows his own woe, and need of succouring grace;

   The martyr's hope half wipes away the trace

   Of flowing blood; the while life's humblest cares

   Smart more, because they hold in Holy Writ no place.


   This be my comfort, in these days of grief,

   Which is not CHRIST's, nor forms heroic tale.

   Apart from Him, if not a sparrow fail,

   May not He pitying view, and send relief

   When foes or friends perplex, and peevish thoughts prevail?


   Then keep good heart, nor take the niggard course

   Of Thomas, who must see ere he would trust.

   Faith will fill up GOD's word, not poorly just

   To the bare letter, heedless of its force,

   But walking by its light amid Earth's sun and dust.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXIII

   AT MESSINA


   Why, wedded to the LORD, still yearns my heart

   Towards these scenes of ancient heathen fame?

   Yet legend hoar, and voice of bard that came

   Fixing my restless youth with its sweet art,


   And shades of power, and those who bore a part

   In the mad deeds that set the world in flame,

   So fret my memory here,--ah! is it blame?--

   That from my eyes the tear is fain to start.


   Nay, from no fount impure these drops arise;

   'Tis but that sympathy with Adam's race

   Which in each brother's history reads its own:--


   So let the cliffs and seas of this fair place

   Be named man's tomb and splendid record-stone,

   High hope, pride-stain'd, the course without the prize.

   See [167]Note


   Say, hast thou track'd a traveller's round,

   Nor visions met thee there,

   Thou couldst but marvel to have found

   This blighted world so fair?


   And feel an awe within thee rise,

   That sinful man should see

   Glories far worthier Seraph's eyes

   Than to be shared by thee


   Store them in heart! thou shalt not faint

   'Mid coming pains and fears,

   As the third heaven once nerved a Saint

   For fourteen trial-years.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXV

   THE PATH OF THE JUST


   When I look back upon my former race,

   Seasons I see, at which the Inward Ray

   More brightly burn'd, or guided some new way;

   Truth, in its wealthier scene and nobler space

   Given for my eye to range, and feet to trace.

   And next I mark, 'twas trial did convey,

   Or grief, or pain, or strange eventful day,

   To my tormented soul such larger grace.


   So now, whene'er, in journeying on, I feel

   The shadow of the Providential Hand,

   Deep breathless stirrings shoot across my breast,

   Searching to know what He will now reveal,

   What sin uncloak, what stricter rule command,

   And girding me to work His full behest.
     __________________________________________________________________

[168]CCCLXVI

   THE WRATH TO COME

   See [169]Note


   When first GOD stirr'd me, and the Church's word

   Came as a theme of reverent search and fear,

   It little cost to own the lustre clear

   O'er rule she taught, and rite, and doctrine, pour'd;


   For conscience craved, and reason did accord.

   Yet one there was that wore a mien austere,

   And I did doubt, and, troubled, ask'd to hear

   Whose mouth had force to edge so sharp a sword.


   My Mother oped her trust, the holy Book;

   And heal'd my pang. She pointed, and I found

   CHRIST on Himself, considerate Master, took

   The utterance of that doctrine's fearful sound.

   The Fount of Love His servants sends to tell

   Love's deeds; Himself reveals the sinner's hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXVII

   FLOWERS WITHOUT FRUIT


   Prune thou thy words, the thoughts control

   That o'er thee swell and throng;

   They will condense within thy soul,

   And change to purpose strong.


   But he who lets his feelings run

   In soft luxurious flow,

   Shrinks when hard service must be done,

   And faints at every woe.


   Faith's meanest deed more favour bears,

   Where hearts and wills are weigh'd,

   Than brightest transports, choicest prayers,

   Which bloom their hour and fade.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXVIII

   THE TWO WORLDS


   Unveil, O LORD, and on us shine

   In glory and in grace;

   This gaudy world grows pale before

   The beauty of Thy face.


   Till Thou art seen, it seems to be

   A sort of fairy ground,

   Where suns unsetting light the sky,

   And flowers and fruits abound.


   But when Thy keener, purer beam

   Is pour'd upon our sight,

   It loses all its power to charm,

   And what was day is night;


   Its noblest toils are then the scourge

   Which made Thy blood to flow;

   Its joys are but the treacherous thorns

   Which circled round Thy brow.


   And thus, when we renounce for Thee

   Its restless aims and fears,

   The tender memories of the past,

   The hopes of coming years,


   Poor is our sacrifice, whose eyes

   Are lighted from above;

   We offer what we cannot keep,

   What we have ceased to love.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXIX

   ZEAL AND PATIENCE

   ST. PAUL IN PRISON


   O comrade bold, of toil and pain!

   Thy trial how severe,

   When sever'd first by prisoner's chain

   From thy loved labour-sphere!


   Say, did impatience first impel

   The heaven-sent bond to break?

   Or, couldst thou bear its hindrance well,

   Loitering for JESU's sake?


   O might we know! for sore we feel

   The languor of delay,

   When sickness lets our fainter zeal,

   Or foes block up our way.


   LORD! Who Thy thousand years dost wait

   To work the thousandth part

   Of Thy vast plan, for us create

   With zeal, a patient heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXX

   TEMPTATION


   O holy LORD, who with the Children Three

   Didst walk the piercing flame,

   Help, in those trial-hours, which, save to Thee,

   I dare not name;

   Nor let these quivering eyes and sickening heart

   Crumble to dust beneath the Tempter's dart.


   Thou, who didst once Thy life from Mary's breast

   Renew from day to day,

   O might her smile, severely sweet, but rest

   On this frail clay!

   Till I am Thine with my whole soul; and fear,

   Not feel a secret joy, that Hell is near.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXXI

   SENSITIVENESS


   Time was, I shrank from what was right

   From fear of what was wrong;

   I would not brave the sacred fight,

   Because the foe was strong.


   But now I cast that finer sense

   And sorer shame aside;

   Such dread of sin was indolence,

   Such aim at Heaven was pride.


   So, when my Saviour calls, I rise

   And calmly do my best;

   Leaving to Him, with silent eyes

   Of hope and fear, the rest.


   I step, I mount where He has led;

   Men count my haltings o'er;--

   I know them; yet, though self I dread,

   I love His precept more.

[170]CCCLXXII

   THE ELEMENTS

   A TRAGIC CHORUS

   See [171]Note


   Man is permitted much

   To scan and learn

   In Nature's frame;

   Till he well-nigh can tame

   Brute mischiefs and can touch

   Invisible things, and turn

   All warring ills to purposes of good.

   Thus, as a god below,

   He can control,

   And harmonize, what seems amiss to flow

   As sever'd from the whole

   And dimly understood.


   But o'er the elements

   One Hand alone

   One Hand has sway.

   What influence day by day

   In straiter belt prevents

   The impious Ocean, thrown

   Alternate o'er the ever-sounding shore?

   Or who has eye to trace

   How the Plague came?

   Forerun the doublings of the Tempest's race?

   Or the Air's weight and flame

   On a set scale explore?


   Thus GOD has will'd

   That man, when fully skill'd,

   Still gropes in twilight dim;

   Encompass'd all his hours

   By fearfullest powers

   Inflexible to him.

   That so he may discern

   His feebleness,

   And e'en for earth's success

   To Him in wisdom turn,

   Who holds for us the keys of either home,--

   Earth and the world to come.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCLXXIII

   THE GUARDIAN ANGEL


   O LORD, how wonderful in depth and height,

   But most in man, how wonderful Thou art!

   With what a love, what soft persuasive might

   Victorious o'er the stubborn fleshly heart,

   Thy tale complete of saints Thou dost provide,

   To fill the throne which Angels lost through pride!


   O man, strange composite of heaven and earth!

   Majesty dwarf'd to baseness! fragrant flower

   Running to poisonous seed! and seeming worth

   Cloking corruption! weakness mastering power!

   Who never art so near to crime and shame,

   As when thou hast achieved some deed of name;--


   How should ethereal natures comprehend

   A thing made up of spirit and of clay,

   Were we not task'd to nurse it and to tend,

   Link'd one to one throughout its mortal day?

   More than the Seraph in his height of place,

   The Angel-guardian knows and loves the ransom'd race.

   CONSOLATIONS IN BEREAVEMENT

   See [173]Note


   Death was full urgent with thee, Sister dear,

   And startling in his speed;--

   Brief pain, then languor till thy end came near--

   Such was the path decreed,

   The hurried road

   To lead thy soul from earth to thine own GOD's abode.


   Death wrought with thee, sweet maid, impatiently:--

   Yet merciful the haste

   That baffles sickness;--dearest, thou didst die,

   Thou wast not made to taste

   Death's bitterness,

   Decline's slow-wasting charm, or fever's fierce distress.


   Death came unheralded:--but it was well;

   For so thy Saviour bore

   Kind witness, thou wast meet at once to dwell

   On His eternal shore;

   All warning spared,

   For none He gives where hearts are for prompt change prepared.


   Death wrought in mystery; both complaint and cure

   To human skill unknown:--

   GOD put aside all means, to make us sure

   It was His deed alone;

   Lest we should lay

   Reproach on our poor selves, that thou wast caught away.


   Death urged as scant of time:--lest, Sister dear,

   We many a lingering day

   Had sicken'd with alternate hope and fear,--

   The ague of delay;

   Watching each spark

   Of promise quench'd in turn, till all our sky was dark.


   Death came and went:--that so thy image might

   Our yearning hearts possess,

   Associate with all pleasant thoughts and bright,

   With youth and loveliness;

   Sorrow can claim,

   Mary, nor lot nor part in thy soft soothing name.


   Joy of sad hearts, and light of downcast eyes!

   Dearest, thou art enshrined

   In all thy fragrance in our memories;

   For we must ever find

   Bare thought of thee

   Freshen this weary life, while weary life shall be.

   A VOICE FROM AFAR


   Weep not for me;--

   Be blithe as wont, nor tinge with gloom

   The stream of love that circles home,

   Light hearts and free!

   Joy in the gifts Heaven's bounty lends;

   Nor miss my face, dear friends!


   I still am near;--

   Watching the smiles I prized on earth,

   Your converse mild, your blameless mirth;

   Now too I hear

   Of whisper'd sounds the tale complete,

   Low prayers, and musings sweet.


   A sea before

   The Throne is spread;--its pure still glass

   Pictures all earth-scenes as they pass.

   We, on its shore,

   Share, in the bosom of our rest,

   GOD's knowledge, and are blest.
     __________________________________________________________________

[174]CCCLXXVI

   A MARTYR-CONVERT


   The number of Thine own complete,

   Sum up and make an end;

   Sift clean the chaff, and house the wheat;

   And then, O LORD, descend.


   Descend, and solve by that descent

   This mystery of life;

   Where good and ill, together blent,

   Wage an undying strife.


   For rivers twain are gushing still,

   And pour a mingled flood;

   Good in the very depths of ill,

   Ill in the heart of good.


   The last are first, the first are last,

   As angel eyes behold;

   These from the sheep-cote sternly cast,

   Those welcomed to the fold.


   No Christian home, no pastor's eye,

   No preacher's vocal zeal,

   Moved Thy dear Martyr to defy

   The prison and the wheel.


   Forth from the heathen ranks she stept,

   The forfeit crown to claim

   Of Christian souls who had not kept

   Their birthright and their name.


   Grace form'd her out of sinful dust;

   She knelt a soul defiled,

   She rose in all the faith, and trust,

   And sweetness of a child.


   And in the freshness of that love

   She preach'd, by word and deed,

   The mysteries of the world above,

   Her new-found, glorious creed.


   And running, in a little hour,

   Of life the course complete,

   She reach'd the Throne of endless power,

   And sits at JESU's feet.

CCCLXXVII

   HORA NOVISSIMA


   Whene'er goes forth Thy dread command,

   And my last hour is nigh,

   LORD, grant me in a Christian land,

   As I was born, to die.


   I pray not, LORD, that friends may be,

   Or kindred, standing by,--

   Choice blessing! which I leave to Thee

   To grant me or deny.


   But let my failing limbs beneath

   My Mother's smile recline;

   And prayers sustain my labouring breath

   From out her sacred shrine,


   And let the Cross beside my bed

   In its due emblems rest;

   And let the absolving words be said,

   To ease a laden breast.


   Thou, LORD, where'er we lie, canst aid;

   But He, who taught His own

   To live as one, will not upbraid

   The dread to die alone.

   A SOUL'S CRY


   Take me away, and in the lowest deep

   There let me be,

   And there in hope the lone night-watches keep,

   Told out for me.

   There, motionless and happy in my pain,

   Lone, not forlorn,--

   There will I sing my sad perpetual strain,

   Until the morn.

   There will I sing, and soothe my stricken breast,

   Which ne'er can cease

   To throb, and pine, and languish, till possest

   Of its Sole Peace.

   There will I sing my absent LORD and Love:--

   Take me away,

   That sooner I may rise, and go above,

   And see Him in the truth of everlasting day.

   Praise to the Holiest in the height,

   And in the depth be praise:

   In all His words most wonderful;

   Most sure in all His ways!


   Woe to thee, man! for he was found

   A recreant in the fight;

   And lost his heritage of heaven,

   And fellowship with light.


   Above him now the angry sky,

   Around the tempest's din;

   Who once had Angels for his friends,

   Had but the brutes for kin.


   O man! a savage kindred they;

   To flee that monster brood

   He scaled the seaside cave, and clomb

   The giants of the wood.


   With now a fear, and now a hope,

   With aids which chance supplied,

   From youth to eld, from sire to son,

   He lived, and toil'd, and died.


   He dreed his penance age by age;

   And step by step began

   Slowly to doff his savage garb,

   And be again a man.


   And quicken'd by the Almighty's breath

   And chasten'd by His rod,

   And taught by angel-visitings,

   At length he sought his GOD;


   And learn'd to call upon His Name,

   And in His faith create

   A household and a father-land,

   A city and a state.


   Glory to Him who from the mire,

   In patient length of days,

   Elaborated into life

   A people to His praise!

   Praise to the Holiest in the height,

   And in the depth be praise:

   In all His words most wonderful;

   Most sure in all His ways!


   O loving wisdom of our GOD!

   When all was sin and shame,

   A second Adam to the fight

   And to the rescue came.


   O wisest love! that flesh and blood

   Which did in Adam fail,

   Should strive afresh against their foe,

   Should strive and should prevail;


   And that a higher gift than grace

   Should flesh and blood refine,

   GOD's Presence and His very Self,

   And Essence all-divine.


   O generous love! that He who smote

   In man for man the foe,

   The double agony in man

   For man should undergo;


   And in the garden secretly,

   And on the cross on high,

   Should teach His brethren and inspire

   To suffer and to die.

   A MORNING PRAYER

   See [176]Note


   I rise and raise my claspéd hands to Thee!

   Henceforth, the darkness hath no part in me,

   Thy sacrifice this day;

   Abiding firm, and with a freeman's might

   Stemming the waves of passion in the fight;--

   Ah, should I from Thee stray,

   My hoary head, Thy table where I bow,

   Will be my shame, which are mine honour now.

   Thus I set out;--LORD! lead me on my way!

   O holiest Truth! how have I lied to Thee!

   I vow'd this day Thy sacrifice to be;

   But I am dim ere night.

   Surely I made my prayer, and I did deem

   That I could keep in me Thy morning beam,

   Immaculate and bright.

   But my foot slipp'd; and, as I lay, he came,

   My gloomy foe, and robb'd me of heaven's flame.

   Help Thou my darkness, LORD, till I am light.

   Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,

   Lead Thou me on!

   The night is dark, and I am far from home--

   Lead Thou me on!

   Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see

   The distant scene,--one step enough for me.


   I was not ever thus, nor pray'd that Thou

   Shouldst lead me on.

   I loved to choose and see my path; but now

   Lead Thou me on!

   I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,

   Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.


   So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still

   Will lead me on,

   O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till

   The night is gone;

   And with the morn those angel faces smile

   Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

   FOR TIRED WORKERS

   C. C. Fraser-Tytler


   We look around, the murky sky is still;

   No answering sunbeam pierces. Clouds lie curl'd

   Upon the dull horizon. Dark is His will

   Who yet hath made us, and His ensigns furl'd.


   Ah, if His speaking thunders were but hurl'd

   Adown the sullen silence! but we stand,

   Holding our puny thread with faithless hand

   Pull'd from the grand disorder of the world.


   What use, what use to hold so small a thing,

   Loosed from the tangled web of giant wrong?

   Let purpose perish and dear hope take wing!

   So cry we. But the angels say, 'Be strong!

   None other threads than these go weave the hem

   Of GOD's own garment; so He treasures them!'

   Why they have never known the way before--

   Why hundreds stand outside Thy mercy's door--

   I know not: but I ask, dear LORD, that Thou

   Wouldst lead them now!


   Why in the hard and thorny way they press

   Unloved, uncomforted, with none to bless,

   In living death, I know not: but spare Thou,

   And lead them now!


   Saviour, be pitiful: their hell is here;

   Dull parchéd sorrow that can shed no tear

   Is theirs. They need indeed no further loss,--

   They bear their cross!


   Eternal death to live away from Thee,

   Eternal loss apart from Thee to be:

   Eternal gain to have in Thee some part--

   To know Thou art!


   Dawn for us here, thou bright undying day;

   So in no dark and sudden-ending way

   Life's timorous steps shall falter, but straight on

   Where CHRIST is gone:--


   To wake and know the new life throbbing, find

   Doubt and disquietude are left behind,

   Eyes open'd, ears attuned to heavenly sound,

   Is Heaven found.

   CROSSING THE RIVER


   In some lone walk through sunburnt fields,

   By sandy path and dusty road,

   Hast thou not cast thine eyes abroad,

   Seen afar off a water'd scene,

   A grove of deep and tender green,

   And found a river flows between?


   There is a stream whose waves divide

   Life from the shady shores beyond;

   And we on this sad side are found,

   Toiling on sandy flats, I ween,

   Sighs our one moisture, tears our sheen,

   While the still river flows between.


   And yet, when our belovéd rise

   To gird them for the ford, and pass

   From wilderness to springing grass,

   From barren waste to living green,

   We weep that they no more are seen,

   And that the river flows between.


   Ah, could we follow where they go

   And pierce the holy shade they find,

   One grief were ours--to stay behind!

   One hope--to join the Blest Unseen,--

   To plant our steps where theirs have been,

   And find no river flows between!

   The night is come, and all the world is still.

   Men say it is a time for sleep and dreams;

   But now she throws no pall upon the space

   That spreads above me, like the God-like face

   Of Him Who looms behind it all. Meseems

   This is the hour for man to bend the knee

   Of the full soul to the Divinity.


   Above, below, on every side there hang

   These circling orbs. And out of keenest sight

   A myriad more pursue their pathless way

   Unerring, through the awful space, where day

   Is not, but an unending fearful night

   Shrouds the immensity. My GOD! the soul

   Of man should faint could he but see the whole!


   Sublimest silence. Yet 'tis broke, for near

   Some sparrow stirs the ivy on the wall,

   Calling me back to take account of this

   We little folk call 'life': to ask if bliss

   For us or sparrow be not all too small

   For Him to take account of, where He stands

   Holding the boundless heavens in His hands?


   Only, for Thee is neither great nor small!

   'Tis human weakness but to count Thee so

   As I, poor mortal, find myself: the slave

   Of Time, himself but hastening to the grave.

   And Thou canst teach the tender blade to grow

   On this small world,--and with an equal might

   Guide the low sweeping of the swallow's flight,


   Or hurl new systems from Thee. Thou art great,

   But smallness is a word of human ken!

   Trembling, my soul remembers this, and dares

   To breathe into the universe its prayers.

   For Thou art in the night, Thou Sun! and when

   We dwell in darkness of the mind, 'tis we

   That turn our faces from Thy radiancy.


   Seeing Thee there, I cannot lose the way

   Even in trackless places, where the soul

   Shivers to feel itself imprison'd here

   In the least part of some least rolling sphere.

   Whither we rush [218] , we know not; but the goal

   To Thee is known. Hold Thou me up, as Thou

   Holdest the universe above me now!


   Yet nearer. Come Thou nearer than to them!

   Blindly they follow Thy behest, but I

   Yearn for Thee strongly through my fleshly frame.

   And so, encompass'd with our flesh, He came,

   Thy Son, Thyself--to make less far and high

   The distant Godhead. Now Thy heavens declare

   No far Creator, but a Father there!

   LORD, I have wrestled through the livelong night;

   Do not depart,

   Nor leave me thus in sad and weary plight,

   Broken in heart;

   Where shall I turn, if Thou shouldst go away,

   And leave me here in this cold world to stay?


   I have no other help, no food, no light,

   No hand to guide;

   The night is dark, my Home is not in sight,

   The path untried;

   I dare not venture in the dark alone,--

   I cannot find my way, if Thou be gone.


   I cannot yet discern Thee as Thou art;

   More let me see;

   I cannot bear the thought that I must part

   Away from Thee:

   I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless;

   Oh! help me, LORD, in all my helplessness!

   THE PASSION


   LORD, when I lift mine eyes to Thee,

   And see Thy bitter woe,

   I ask, why should the Holy One

   Such sorrows undergo?


   LORD, who are they that thus inflict

   Those oft-repeated blows

   Upon Thy virgin Form, that still

   No human sin-stain knows?


   Who are the foes that drag Thee on

   To undeservéd woe,--

   That will not, or for shame, or fear,

   One vengeance-stroke forego?


   The first of all, Thy boundless Love,

   That could not rest within

   While man remain'd apart from GOD;--

   The next, my own deep sin.


   These two, dear LORD, have drawn Thee on

   Through all Thou didst endure;

   Let not Thy Love be spent in vain,

   The curse of sin to cure.


   Oh! never let me wound again

   The Love that set me free;

   Nor ever crucify afresh

   The GOD Who died for me!

   LIGHT IN THE WOOD


   What is it that amid some earthly home,

   Where all have equal nurture, and the care

   Of loving hearts forbids all harm to come

   Within the limits of its sacred lair,

   Makes difference in those who dwell therein;--

   Some unrefined by grace, while others brightness win?


   All seem alike within the sacred bound,

   And freely blend throughout the livelong day;

   But ever and anon some traits are found

   In one or other, which define the way

   Of closer walk with GOD well sought and found,

   While others linger more on lower earthly ground.


   As 'mid the thickness of some leafy wood,

   The sunbeams find a passage here and there,

   And light some spot which erst in shadow stood,

   Making each leaflet look more bright and fair,

   While other patches, that lie round it, miss

   The ray of radiant Light that fills itself with bliss,--


   So is it in the tangled wood of life:

   Some souls there are that keep the open way,

   Free from the boughs of earthly hindrance, rife

   For every advent of the Heavenly ray;--

   Ready to catch it as in love it comes

   To seek the loving souls that are its willing homes.


   And as it shines it points them out to view

   As diverse from the rest, then flits away,

   And leaves them each their duties to pursue,

   Like other men, in common light of day;--

   Lest they should think themselves so much GOD's choice

   That they have only need to linger and rejoice.


   --Force not thy upward growth, but first of all

   Deepen thy roots, then may'st thou well sustain

   The rays of sunlight that upon thee fall,

   And, without withering, all thy strength retain.

   Plants that have little else but leaf and flower,

   However bright their hue, live but their little hour.

   YOUTH'S BRIGHTNESS GONE


   The flash of youthful light is past and gone;

   Not as of yore

   Earth's joys abound; but I am left alone

   Still more and more,

   As one by one the little sparks go out

   From this world's stubble, that lies round about.


   One hope remains, and that, as others fade,

   Grows brighter still

   As shadows lengthen o'er this earthly glade,

   And up the hill

   We higher mount towards the final Home,

   To which in GOD's good time we hope to come.


   And even here, where darkness gathers round,

   All is not dark,

   There is, 'midst all, one spot of holy ground

   Which bears Heaven's mark--

   The Place which GOD has chosen for His own,

   That He may come and make His Presence known.


   To that I cling the more as eventide

   Creeps on and on,

   Scattering its sable shadows far and wide,

   And, one by one,

   Bidding the weary lay them down to rest,

   In trust and love upon their FATHER's Breast.

   Winding or straight, it leads

   Right onward to Thy rest.

   Choose Thou for me, my GOD;

   Choose Thou for me my friends,

   My sickness or my health;

   Choose Thou my cares for me,

   I found in Him a resting-place,

   And He has made me glad.


   I heard the voice of JESUS say,

   I am this dark world's light,

   Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,

   And all thy day be bright.

   I look'd to JESUS, and I found

   In Him my Star, my Sun;

   And in that light of life I'll walk,

   Till travelling days are done.


   I heard the voice of JESUS say,

   Behold, I freely give

   The living water, thirsty one,

   He is gone--beyond the skies,

   A cloud receives Him from our eyes;

   Gone beyond the highest height

   Of mortal gaze or angel's flight;

   Through the veils of Time and Space,

   Pass'd into the Holiest Place;

   All the toil, the sorrow done,

   All the battle fought and won.


   He is gone--and we return,

   And our hearts within us burn;

   Olivet no more shall greet

   With welcome shout His coming feet;

   Never shall we track Him more

   On Gennesareth's glistening shore;

   Never in that look or voice

   Shall Zion's hill again rejoice.


   He is gone--and we remain

   In this world of sin and pain;

   In the void which He has left,

   On this earth of Him bereft,

   We have still His work to do,

   We can still His path pursue;

   Seek Him both in friend and foe,

   In ourselves His image show.


   He is gone--we heard Him say,

   'Good that I should go away.'

   Gone is that dear Form and Face,

   But not gone His present grace;

   Though Himself no more we see,

   Comfortless we cannot be:

   No, His Spirit still is ours,

   Quickening, freshening all our powers.


   He is gone--towards their goal,

   World and Church must onwards roll:

   Far behind we leave the past;

   Forwards are our glances cast;

   Still His words before us range

   Through the ages, as they change:

   Wheresoe'er the Truth shall lead,

   He will give whate'er we need.


   He is gone--but we once more

   Shall behold Him as before;

   In the Heaven of Heavens the same,

   As on earth He went and came.

   In the many mansions there,

   Place for us will He prepare

   In that world, unseen, unknown,

   He and we may yet be one.

   HOLD NOT THY PEACE AT MY TEARS

   What is the saddest sweetest lowest sound

   Nearest akin to perfect silence? Not

   The delicate whisper sometimes in the hot

   Autumnal morning heard the cornfields round;

   Nor yet to lonely man, now almost bound

   By slumber, near his house a murmuring river

   Buzzing and droning o'er the stones for ever.

   Not such faint voice of Autumn oat-encrown'd,

   And not such liquid murmur, O my heart!

   But tears that drop o'er graves, and sins, and fears,

   A sound the very weeper scarcely hears,

   A music in which silence hath some part.

   Clothed in white apparel, holding palms of Victory in their hand.


   They have come from tribulation, and have wash'd their robes in Blood,

   Wash'd them in the Blood of JESUS; tried they were, and firm they

   Gladly, LORD, with Thee they suffer'd; gladly, LORD, with Thee they

   And by Death to Life immortal they were born and glorified.


   Now they reign in heavenly glory, now they walk with golden light,

   Now they drink as from a river, holy bliss and infinite;

   Love and Peace they taste for ever; and all Truth and Knowledge see

   In the beatific vision of the Blesséd Trinity.


   GOD of GOD, the One-begotten, Light of Light, Emmanuel,

   THE CRY OF THE LOST ANSWERED


   That was the Shepherd of the flock; He knew

   The distant voice of one poor sheep astray;

   It had forsaken Him, but He was true,

   And listen'd for its bleating night and day.

   Lost in a pitfall, yet alive it lay,

   To breathe the faint sad call that He would know;

   But now the slighted fold was far away,

   And no approaching footstep soothed its woe.


   A thing of life and nurture from above

   Sunk under earth where all was cold and dim,

   With nothing in it to console His love,

   Only the miserable cry for Him.

   His was the wounded heart, the bleeding limb

   That safe and sound He would have joy'd to keep;

   And still, amidst the flock at home with Him,

   He was the Shepherd of that one lost sheep.


   Oh! would He now but come and claim His own,

   How more than precious His restoring care!

   How sweet the pasture of His choice alone,

   How bright the dullest path if He were there!

   How well the pain of rescue it could bear,

   Held in the shelter of His strong embrace!

   With Him it would find herbage anywhere,

   And springs of endless life in every place.


   And so He came and raised it from the clay,

   While evil beasts went disappointed by.

   He bore it home along the fearful way

   In the soft light of His rejoicing eye.

   And thou fallen soul, afraid to live or die

   In the deep pit that will not set thee free,

   Lift up to Him the helpless homeward cry,

   For all that tender love is seeking thee.

   THE PAIN OF LOVE

   F. W. Faber


   JESUS! why dost Thou love me so?

   What hast Thou seen in me

   To make my happiness so great,

   So dear a joy to Thee?


   Wert Thou not GOD, I then might think

   Thou hadst no eye to read

   The badness of that selfish heart,

   For which Thine own did bleed.


   But Thou art GOD, and knowest all;

   Dear LORD! Thou knowest me;

   And yet Thy knowledge hinders not

   Thy love's sweet liberty.


   Ah, how Thy grace hath woo'd my soul

   With persevering wiles!

   Now give me tears to weep; for tears

   Are deeper joy than smiles.


   Each proof renew'd of Thy great love

   Humbles me more and more,

   And brings to light forgotten sins,

   And lays them at my door.


   The more I love Thee, LORD! the more

   I hate my own cold heart;

   The more Thou woundest me with love,

   The more I feel the smart.


   What shall I do, then, dearest LORD!

   Say, shall I fly from Thee,

   And hide my poor unloving self

   Where Thou canst never see?


   Or shall I pray that Thy dear love

   To me might not be given?

   Ah no! love must be pain on earth,

   If it be bliss in Heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCCIII

   SELF-LOVE


   Oh I could go through all life's troubles singing,

   Turning earth's night to day,

   If self were not so fast around me, clinging

   To all I do or say.


   My very thoughts are selfish, always building

   Mean castles in the air;

   I use my love of others for a gilding

   To make myself look fair.


   I fancy all the world engross'd with judging

   My merit or my blame;

   Its warmest praise seems an ungracious grudging

   Of praise which I might claim.


   In youth or age, by city, wood, or mountain,

   Self is forgotten never;

   Where'er we tread, it gushes like a fountain,

   And its waters flow for ever.


   Alas! no speed in life can snatch us wholly

   Out of self's hateful sight;

   And it keeps step, whene'er we travel slowly,

   And sleeps with us at night.


   O miserable omnipresence, stretching

   Over all time and space,

   How have I run from thee, yet found thee reaching

   The goal in every race!


   The opiate balms of grace may haply still thee,

   Deep in my nature lying;

   For I may hardly hope, alas! to kill thee,

   Save by the act of dying.


   O LORD! that I could waste my life for others,

   With no ends of my own,

   That I could pour myself into my brothers,

   And live for them alone!


   Such was the life Thou livedst; self abjuring,

   Thine own pains never easing,

   Our burdens bearing, our just doom enduring,

   A life without self-pleasing!
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCCIV

   SWEETNESS IN PRAYER


   Why dost thou beat so quick, my heart?

   Why struggle in thy cage?

   What shall I do for thee, poor heart!

   Thy throbbing heat to swage?


   What spell is this come over thee,

   My soul! what sweet surprise?

   And wherefore these unbidden tears

   That start into mine eyes?


   How great, how good does GOD appear,

   How dear our holy faith,

   How tasteless life's best joys have grown;

   How I could welcome death!


   --Would that Thou mightest stay with me,

   Or else that I might die

   While heart and soul are still subdued

   With Thy sweet mastery.


   Thy home is with the humble, LORD!

   The simple are Thy rest;

   Thy lodging is in child-like hearts;

   Thou makest there Thy nest.


   Dear Comforter! Eternal Love!

   If Thou wilt stay with me,

   Of lowly thoughts and simple ways

   I'll build a nest for Thee.


   Who made this beating heart of mine,

   But Thou, my heavenly Guest?

   Let no one have it then but Thee,

   And let it be Thy nest.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCCV

   THE WILL OF GOD


   I worship Thee, Sweet Will of GOD!

   And all Thy ways adore,

   And every day I live, I seem

   To love Thee more and more.


   Thou wert the end, the blesséd rule

   Of our Saviour's toils and tears;

   Thou wert the passion of His Heart

   Those Three-and-thirty years.


   And He hath breathed into my soul

   A special love of Thee,

   A love to lose my will in His,

   And by that loss be free.


   He always wins who sides with GOD,

   To him no chance is lost;

   GOD's Will is sweetest to him, when

   It triumphs at his cost.


   When obstacles and trials seem

   Like prison-walls to be,

   I do the little I can do,

   And leave the rest to Thee.

   VIA CRUCIS

   See [184]Note


   From pain to pain, from woe to woe,

   With loving hearts and footsteps slow,

   To Calvary with CHRIST we go.

   See how His Precious Blood

   At every Station pours!

   Was ever grief like His?

   Was ever sin like ours?

   JESUS CRUCIFIED

   See [186]Note


   Oh come and mourn with me awhile!

   See, Mary calls us to her side;

   Oh come and let us mourn with her;

   [187]JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   Have we no tears to shed for Him,

   While soldiers scoff and Jews deride?

   Ah! look how patiently He hangs;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   His Mother cannot reach His Face;

   She stands in helplessness beside;

   Her heart is martyr'd with her Son's;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   Seven times He spoke, seven words of love,

   And all three hours His silence cried

   For mercy on the souls of men;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   What was Thy crime, my dearest LORD?

   By earth, by heaven, Thou hast been tried,

   And guilty found of too much love;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   Death came, and JESUS meekly bow'd;

   His falling eyes He strove to guide

   With mindful love to Mary's face;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   Oh break, oh break, hard heart of mine!

   Thy weak self-love and guilty pride

   His Pilate and His Judas were;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   Come, take thy stand beneath the Cross,

   And let the Blood from out that Side

   Fall gently on thee drop by drop;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   A broken heart, a fount of tears,

   Ask, and they will not be denied;

   A broken heart Love's cradle is;

   JESUS, our Love, is crucified!


   O Love of GOD! O Sin of man!

   In this dread act your strength is tried;

   And victory remains with Love;

   For He, our Love, is crucified!

   STARLIGHT

   R. Wilton


   At midnight, when yon azure fields on high

   Sparkle and glow without one cloudy bar,

   The radiance of some 'bright particular star'

   Attracts, perchance, and holds my watching eye.


   That star may long have vanish'd from the sky;

   Yet still its unspent rays, borne from afar,

   Come darting downwards in their golden car--

   Proof it once glitter'd in the galaxy.


   So in my heart I feel a healing ray

   Sweetly transmitted from a Star divine,

   Which once illumed the coasts of Palestine:

   And though its beauty beams not there to-day,

   I know that Star of old did truly shine,

   Because its cheering radiance now is mine.
     __________________________________________________________________

CCCCIX

   IONA


   I landed on Iona's holy isle,

   And wander'd through its ancient ruins bare,

   And felt the great Columba's self was there.

   Thirteen long centuries seem'd 'a little while'


   Before the unchanging sea and sky, whose smile

   He knew. He trod these paths; he breathed this air;

   These waves once roll'd responsive to his prayer,

   Whose murmuring ripples now my ear beguile.


   Nor to the Saint alone closer I stand,

   Nearer the LORD I seem, upon this shore;

   The solid rock of this historic strand

   Helps me to bridge Time's waste of waters o'er,

   And grasp His feet, and feel His loving hand

   In Whom all saints are one for evermore!

   AN INCIDENT

   See [190]Note


   At the LORD's Table waiting, robed and stoled,

   Till all had knelt around, I saw a sign!

   In the full chalice sudden splendours shine,

   Azure and crimson, emerald and gold.


   I stoop'd to see the wonder, when, behold!

   Within the cup a Countenance Divine

   Look'd upwards at me through the trembling wine,

   Suffused with tenderest love and grief untold.


   The comfort of that sacramental token

   From Memory's page Time never can erase;

   The glass of that rich window may be broken,

   But not the mirror'd image of His grace,

   Through which my dying LORD to me has spoken,

   At His own Holy Table, face to face!

   SONG OF AN ANGEL

   F. Tennyson


   At noon a shower had fallen, and the clime

   Breathed sweetly, and upon a cloud there lay

   One more sublime in beauty than the Day,

   Or all the Sons of Time;


   A gold harp had he, and was singing there

   Songs that I yearn'd to hear; a glory shone

   Of rosy twilights on his cheeks--a zone

   Of amaranth on his hair.


   He sang of joys to which the earthly heart

   Hath never beat; he sang of deathless Youth,

   And by the throne of Love, Beauty and Truth

   Meeting, no more to part;


   He sang lost Hope, faint Faith, and vain Desire

   Crown'd there; great works, that on the earth began,

   Accomplish'd; towers impregnable to man

   Scaled with the speed of fire;


   Of Power, and Life, and wingéd Victory

   He sang--of bridges strown 'twixt star and star--

   And hosts all arm'd in light for bloodless war

   Pass, and repass on high;


   Lo! in the pauses of his jubilant voice

   He leans to listen: answers from the spheres,

   And mighty paeans thundering he hears

   Down the empyreal skies:


   Then suddenly he ceased--and seem'd to rest

   His goodly-fashion'd arm upon a slope

   Of that fair cloud, and with soft eyes of hope

   He pointed towards the West;


   And shed on me a smile of beams, that told

   Of a bright World beyond the thunder-piles,

   With blesséd fields, and hills, and happy isles,

   And citadels of gold.

   O GOD, impart Thy blessing to my cries,

   Tho' I trust deeply, yet I daily err;

   The waters of my heart are oft astir:--

   An Angel's there! and yet I cannot rise!


   I wish that CHRIST were here among us still,

   Proffering His bosom to his servant's brow;

   But oh! that holy voice comes o'er us now

   Like twilight echoes from a distant hill:


   We long for His pure looks and words sublime;

   His lowly-lofty innocence and grace;

   The talk sweet-toned, and blessing all the time;

   The mountain sermon and the ruthful gaze;

   The cheerly credence gather'd from His face;

   His voice in village-groups at eve or prime!

   THE LATTICE AT SUNRISE


   As on my bed at dawn I mused and pray'd,

   I saw my lattice prankt upon the wall,

   The flaunting leaves and flitting birds withal--

   A sunny phantom interlaced with shade;


   'Thanks be to heaven,' in happy mood I said,

   'What sweeter aid my matins could befall

   Than this fair glory from the East hath made?

   What holy sleights hath GOD, the LORD of all,


   To bid us feel and see! We are not free

   To say we see not, for the glory tomes

   Nightly and daily, like the flowing sea;

   His lustre pierceth through the midnight glooms;

   And, at prime hour, behold! He follows me

   With golden shadows to my secret rooms!'

   Perchance this Memphian girl, dead ere her prime,

   Shall drop her mask, and with dark new-born eyes


   Salute our English Mary, loved and lost;

   The Father knows her little [195]scroll of prayer,

   And life as pure as His Egyptian air;

   For, though she knew not JESUS, nor the cost


   At which He won the world, she learn'd to pray;

   And though our own sweet babe on CHRIST's good name

   Spent her last breath, premonish'd and advised

   Of Him, and in His glorious Church baptized,

   --She will not spurn this old-world child away,

   Nor put her poor embalméd heart to shame.

   THE HARVEST MOON


   How peacefully the broad and golden moon

   Comes up to gaze upon the reaper's toil!

   That they who own the land for many a mile,

   May bless her beams, and they who take the boon


   Of scatter'd ears; Oh! beautiful! how soon

   The dusk is turn'd to silver without soil,

   Which makes the fair sheaves fairer than at noon,

   And guides the gleaner to his slender spoil;


   So, to our souls, the LORD of love and might

   Sends harvest-hours, when daylight disappears;

   When age and sorrow, like a coming night,

   Darken our field of work with doubts and fears,

   He times the presence of His heavenly light

   To rise up softly o'er our silver hairs.

   A record lives of thine identity!

   Thou [198]shalt not lose one charm of lip or eye;

   The hues and liquid lights shall wait for thee,

   And the fair tissues, wheresoe'er they be!

   --Daughter of heaven! our grieving hearts repose

   On the dear thought that we once more shall see

   Thy beauty--like Himself our Master rose--

   So shall that beauty its old rights maintain,

   There lives no record of reply,

   Which telling what it is to die

   Had surely added praise to praise.


   From every house the neighbours met,

   The streets were fill'd with joyful sound,

   A solemn gladness even crown'd

   The purple brows of Olivet.


   Behold a man raised up by CHRIST!

   All other, when her ardent gaze

   Roves from the living brother's face,

   And rests upon the Life indeed.


   All subtle thought, all curious fears,

   Borne down by gladness so complete,

   She bows, she bathes the Saviour's feet

   With costly spikenard and with tears.


   Thrice blest whose lives are faithful prayers,

   Whose loves in higher love endure;

   Are both forgivers and forgiven!

   IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

   EMMIE

   See [200]Note


   Our doctor had call'd in another, I never had seen him before,

   But he sent a chill to my heart when I saw him come in at the door,

   Fresh from the surgery-schools of France and of other lands--

   Harsh red hair, big voice, big chest, big merciless hands!

   Wonderful cures he had done, O yes, but they said too of him

   He was happier using the knife than in trying to save the limb,

   And that I can well believe, for he look'd so coarse and so red

   I could think he was one of those who would break their jests on the
   dead,

   And mangle the living dog that had loved him and fawn'd at his knee--

   Drench'd with the hellish [201]oorali--that ever such things should be!


   Here was a boy--I am sure that some of our children would die

   But for the voice of Love, and the smile, and the comforting eye--

   Here was a boy in the ward, every bone seem'd out of its place--

   Caught in a mill and crush'd--it was all but a hopeless case:

   And he handled him gently enough; but his voice and his face were not
   kind,

   And it was but a hopeless case, he had seen it and made up his mind,

   And he said to me roughly 'The lad will need little more of your care.'

   'All the more need,' I told him, 'to seek the LORD JESUS in prayer;

   They are all His children here, and I pray for them all as my own:'

   But he turn'd to me, 'Ay, good woman, can prayer set a broken bone?'

   Then he mutter'd half to himself, but I know that I heard him say

   'All very well--but the good LORD JESUS has had His day.'


   Had? has it come? It has only dawn'd. It will come by and by.

   O how could I serve in the wards if the hope of the world were a lie?

   How could I bear with the sights and the loathsome smells of disease

   But that He said 'Ye do it to Me, when ye do it to these'?


   So he went. And we past to this ward where the younger children are
   laid:

   Here is the cot of our orphan, our darling, our meek little maid;

   Empty you see just now! We have lost her who loved her so much--

   Patient of pain tho' as quick as a sensitive plant to the touch;

   Hers was the prettiest prattle, it often moved me to tears,

   Hers was the gratefullest heart I have found in a child of her years--

   Nay you remember our Emmie; you used to send her the flowers;

   How she would smile at 'em, play with 'em, talk to 'em hours after
   hours!

   They that can wander at will where the works of the LORD. are reveal'd

   Little guess what joy can be got from a cowslip out of the field;

   Flowers to these 'spirits in prison' are all they can know of the
   spring,

   They freshen and sweeten the wards like the waft of an Angel's wing;

   And she lay with a flower in one hand and her thin hands crost on her
   breast--

   Wan, but as pretty as heart can desire, and we thought her at rest,

   Quietly sleeping--so quiet, our doctor said 'Poor little dear,

   Nurse, I must do it to-morrow; she'll never live thro' it, I fear.'


   I walk'd with our kindly old Doctor as far as the head of the stair,

   Then I return'd to the ward; the child didn't see I was there.


   Never since I was nurse, had I been so grieved and so vext!

   Emmie had heard him. Softly she call'd from her cot to the next,

   'He says I shall never live thro' it, O Annie, what shall I do?'

   Annie consider'd. 'If I,' said the wise little Annie, 'was you,

   I should cry to the dear LORD JESUS to help me, for, Emmie, you see,

   It's all in the picture there: Little children should come to Me.'

   (Meaning the print that you gave us, I find that it always can please

   Our children, the dear LORD JESUS with children about His knees.)

   'Yes, and I will,' said Emmie, 'but then if I call to the LORD,

   How should He know that it's me? such a lot of beds in the ward!'

   That was a puzzle for Annie. Again she consider'd, and said:

   Emmie, you put out your arms, and you leave 'em outside on the bed--

   The LORD has so much to see to! but, Emmie, you tell it Him plain,

   It's the little girl with her arms lying out on the counterpane.


   I had sat three nights by the child--I could not watch her for four--

   My brain had begun to reel--I felt I could do it no more.

   That was my sleeping-night, but I thought that it never would pass.

   There was a thunderclap once, and a clatter of hail on the glass,

   And there was a phantom cry that I heard as I tost about,

   The motherless bleat of a lamb in the storm and the darkness without;

   My sleep was broken besides with dreams of the dreadful knife

   And fears for our delicate Emmie who scarce would escape with her life;

   Then in the gray of the morning it seem'd she stood by me and smiled,

   And the doctor came at his hour, and we went to see to the child.


   He had brought his ghastly tools: we believed her asleep again--

   Her dear, long, lean, little arms lying out on the counterpane;

   Say that His day is done! Ah why should we care what they say?

   The LORD of the children had heard her, and Emmie had past away.

NOTES
EXPLANATORY AND BIOGRAPHICAL

  INTRODUCTION TO [202]BOOK I

   English lyrical religious poetry is less easily divisible than our
   secular verse into well-marked periods, whether in regard to matter or
   to manner. Throughout its long course it has in great measure the
   groundwork of a common Book, a common Faith, and a common Purpose. And
   although incidents from human life and aspects of nature are not
   excluded (and have in this selection, when possible, been specially
   gathered, with the view of varying the garland here presented)--yet
   meditation, prayer, and praise will ever be the three great keys,
   successively rising in order of lyrical intensity, through which this
   music of the heart of Christianity expresses itself. Certain differing
   waves of feeling and expression may however be traced, and have
   suggested the tripartite division which will here be followed;--whilst
   yet we may say, as was said of the blessed Spirits met by Dante as be
   entered Paradise,


     ... tutti fanno bello il primo giro,

     E differentemente han dolce vita,

     Per sentir più e men l' eterno spiro.

   If we take our First Book as covering about the space between 1500 and
   1680, we begin with a preliminary or tentative period, when the joyous
   and picturesque mediaevalism of Dunbar's Nativity passes at once into
   the sombre style characteristic of the thirty agitated and painful
   years which were the birth-throes of the Reformation. This was an
   ungenial atmosphere for sacred song. Yet the reign of Elizabeth was
   hardly more fertile--the Renaissance movement in our poetry led English
   writers into the pleasant paths of a revived and (with them) innocent
   classicalism: whilst the unsettled elements in the religious sphere,
   the dominance of Genevan doctrine--fervid indeed, but narrow,
   ultra-dogmatic, and rarely blessed by the smile of the Muses--were
   conditions equally disfavourable.

   When the tide begins to flow more freely, our sacred poetry was
   enriched by such splendid outbursts of pure lyrical enthusiasm as the
   odes by Spenser and Milton, with which the Elizabethan age maybe said
   almost to begin and to close. But lyrics of this class are only too
   rare; and our religious verse tends to fall into that didactic vein
   which seems characteristic of the English genius; it is meditative,
   introspective, personal, yet seldom in the modern more subtly
   analytical manner. And as the seventeenth century advances, it is
   varied by some singular and attractive specimens of mystical poetry, in
   which we may perceive at once the wide literary scholarship of that age
   and the effect of the evil days of the Commonwealth Usurpation, driving
   men for peace into the solitude of their own bosoms.

   Our first period, it will be seen, is, however, by far most richly
   indebted to two writers, trained in the school of doctrine and practice
   which found its earliest great teacher in Richard Hooker. With this
   spirit, gradually systematized and widened, until it became the genuine
   and enduring representative of the mind of the English Church, Herbert
   and Vaughan were deeply imbued--with its broad scholarly learning, its
   liberal acceptance of art and culture, its faith at once rational,
   deeply founded, and fervent,

     --The gracious creed that knows how to forgive,--

   its strong and living sense of the underlying unity of the Christian
   Church through all her centuries of change or development.--But
   Theology, as such, is not within the purpose of this little book. In
   the City of God are many mansions; and whichever may be ours, the
   religious elements just enumerated, it is undeniable, made powerfully
   towards poetry: they may be easily traced throughout as inspiring
   Herbert in his quiet Wiltshire Valley and Vaughan among the wild hills
   of Brecon.--The difference between the respective poetical gifts of
   these two men--gifts which a just criticism must rate very high--may be
   best left to the reader's discrimination and enjoyment. Only this need
   here be noted, that both are instinct with the fervour, with the
   strangeness, of the Celtic sensitive imagination; concealed indeed in
   some degree by Herbert's academical training, but everywhere pervading
   his disciple's work with a certain fascinating intensity.

   Vaughan long over-lived the Restoration: after which date the condensed
   style, not free from overstrained fancy and 'conceit,' popular hitherto
   in the seventeenth century, gradually gave way to a greater simplicity
   of thought and language, a less imaginative colouring;--to what, in a
   word, we might call the modern manner. To this time naturally belongs
   the beginning of religious song for public use. Perhaps the specimens
   here given might have been ranged with the hymns of the next hundred
   years. But they are placed in our first book because in style and in
   thought they are yet closely allied to the preceding period: they unite
   our own hymnology, looked at as a whole, with the last echoes of the
   Elizabethan age.

   William Dunbar, 'a poet,' said Sir Walter Scott, 'unrivalled by any
   that Scotland has ever produced,' was educated at the University of S.
   Andrews, entered the Franciscan Order, but seems to have lived much
   about the Scottish Court, or employed on secular business. He was the
   last great representative of Chaucer's School in Scotland; he stands on
   the boundary between the world of the Middle Ages and the world of the
   Renaissance. Like the rich and lovely architecture of his time,
   Dunbar's poetry is the fine flower of expiring Mediaevalism.

   The graceful hymn here given is reprinted from Mr. H. M. Fitzgibbon's
   excellent little Selection of Early English Poetry (W. Scott, 1887).
   The spelling has been modernized; a process without which, small as are
   the substantial deviations from modern usage, the early Scottish
   orthography has, at first sight, the aspect of an unknown tongue.

   Thomas, second Lord Vaux of Harrowden, held state appointments under
   Henry VIII, and was among the first of those high-born and
   high-educated writers with whom our modern literature begins.

   [205]II and [206]III, published in the Paradise of Dainty Devices,
   1576, reflect the gloom of that unhappy period between the middle of
   the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth. Great is the contrast between
   their tone and the joyous brilliancy of [207]Spenser's noble
   ode--published 1596-- which follows.

   [209]l. 15 trinal triplicities: A treatise on the Heavenly Hierarchy
   (erroneously ascribed to Dionysius the Areopagite, but of early date),
   which was held as an authority for many centuries, ranks the Angels in
   three main Orders, each subdivided into three. 'The names' (Dictionary
   of Christian Biography, 1877), 'appear to have been obtained by
   combining with the more obvious Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangels, and
   Angels, the five deduced from two passages of S. Paul, Eph. i. 21, and
   Col. i. 16.'

   Compare Milton, Par. Lost, v. 748:--


     the mighty regencies

     Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones

     In their triple degrees.

   [210]10 V To this deeply-felt sonnet (which forms a fit comparison to
   Shakespeare's Poor Soul), the noble author has added the words:--

     Splendidis Longum Valedico Nugis:

   with obvious reference to his romantic or amorous writings, Arcadia or
   Astrophel.

   Humfrey Gifford, 'Gentleman,' probably from a Devonshire family in the
   Bideford country, published his one book, (preserved now in a single
   copy), A Posie of Gilloflowers, in 1580. His verse is fresh, simple,
   spirited, and singularly modern in style.

   Robert Southwell, of Horsham S. Faith's, Norfolk, was trained at Douai
   and Paris: at Rome, in 1578, entered the Society of Jesus: in 1586
   returned to England: by 1590, for performance of his religious duties
   as a priest was imprisoned, thirteen times racked, and judicially
   murdered by the Elizabethan Government in 1595

   Ben Jenson said to the poet Drummond at Hawthornden (1618-9) that 'so
   he had written that piece, the Burning Babe, he would have been content
   to destroy many of his.' Fervour and sincerity of devotion, passionate
   intensity of faith in the Lord and Master under Whose name he served,
   has never received more beautiful expression than in this and the
   following poem, which their martyr--author probably thought out or (if
   the thirteen torturings of the persecutors left him the power), wrote
   down during his imprisonment.

   [215]15 XII

   Taken, with several other inedited or little known early hymns,
   charming through their simplicity and depth of feeling, from the
   'Illustrative Poems' appended by Mr. W. T. Brooke to his edition of
   Christ's Victory and Triumph (Griffith & Co., 1888). It has been
   ascribed mainly to Dr. Nicholas Postgate, Missioner in the Roman
   Communion, 'who, for baptizing a child, and exercising other priestly
   functions, was executed at York' in 1679, at 82 years of age.

   [216]16 XIII

   Of Barnabe Barnes, says Dr. Grosart, who has edited his poems with his
   usual loving diligence, little is known but that he was son to Richard,
   Bishop of Durham, studied at Oxford, and served under Lord Essex in his
   expedition to France. His sonnets show truth of feeling and freedom
   from ingenious 'conceits': he seems to have formed his style upon that
   of Sir P. Sidney, to whose Astrophel he makes reference.

   [217]17 XVI

   Printed 1601; signed F. B. P. in a British Museum manuscript. 'Founded
   upon Cardinal Peter Damiani's Ad perennis vitae fontem' (W. T. Brooke).

   John Donne was educated at Hart Hall, Oxford, and Trinity, Cambridge:
   admitted at Lincoln's Inn, travelled widely in Europe, and accompanied
   Lord Essex on his expeditions in 1596 and 1597. Took Holy Orders in
   1614: in 1620 was appointed Dean of S. Paul's.

   Donne's poems were first collected in 1633: they cover an extraordinary
   range in subject, and are throughout marked with a strange originality
   almost equally fascinating and repellent. It is possible that his
   familiarity with Italian and Spanish literatures, both at that time
   deeply coloured by fantastic and far-fetched thought, may have in some
   degree influenced him in that direction. His poems were probably
   written mainly during youth. There is a strange solemn passionate
   earnestness about them, a quality which underlies the fanciful
   'conceits' of all his work. Donne, like Herbert and Vaughan, who show
   the same intensity and quaintness, was of Welsh descent.

   [219]20 XXI

   The details of Thomas Campion's life share in the darkness which covers
   almost all our Elizabethan poets. By profession he was a Doctor of
   Medicine. His first English songs appeared in 1601; but we may
   reasonably suppose that he had practised poetry, as well as music, for
   some years previously. Campion's songs are admirable for their union of
   melodious simplicity, beauty, and strong common sense. So rare are the
   music-books in which they appeared, that they were practically
   rediscovered for us by Mr. A. H. Bullen, who has published the best in
   his charming selection of Lyrics (Nimmo, 1889).--No. [220]XXVII,
   originally printed 1606, is from Mr. Bullen's volume. This is a song of
   great force and originality. The unknown writer saw deep into human
   nature.

   [221]24 XXX

   William Drummond: educated at the High School and (newly founded)
   University of Edinburgh. On the Continent, 1606-9; settled for life at
   'classic Hawthornden' 1610. His letters, journal, and library show a
   very wide and well-chosen range of study: they perhaps present the
   first detailed picture we have of a man of literature in the modern
   sense. Drummond's (published 1616 and 1623) is the only Scottish poetry
   which reflects the finest features of the English Elizabethan
   Renaissance: he has exquisite feeling, meditative grace, charm of form
   and style. In the troubles of Scotland during the reign of Charles I he
   used all his influence towards peace, moderation, culture, rational
   loyalty and unfanatical religion; but his counsels were far too wise
   for acceptance by either party of the day.

   [222]25 XXXII

   [223]l. 3 In silence: So Menander--apanta aigon 'o theos exergazetai.

   [224]26 XXXV

   This rendering (5 stanzas, of 8 in the Roman Breviary text), appears to
   have been written by Drummond for a translation of the Primer or Office
   of the Blessed Virgin Mary: a copy of which, dated 1615, is in the
   British Museum (W. T. Brooke).

   [225]25 XXXVII

   George Herbert was born in Montgomery Castle, son to Richard and
   Magdalen Newport (descended in the female line from Bleddyn, Prince of
   Powys, and Gwenllian, daughter to Gruffydd, Prince of North Wales), an
   admirable woman, whose loving care (the father dying early) trained her
   son's early years. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity,
   Cambridge, and soon distinguished for varied and sound study. Elected
   Public Orator 1620: made enduring friendship with Dr. Donne, Bishop
   Andrewes, and Francis Bacon. His interests were divided between
   entering a profession, and the Court; where he seems to have been in
   favour with James I. But by 1627 Herbert's hopes of royal advancement
   ended. After much inward conflict, he decided on Holy Orders: retired
   from Cambridge, his health beginning to fail; married, and in 1630, at
   the request of his kinsman Philip, Lord Pembroke, was presented with
   the cure of Bemerton, a village between Salisbury and Wilton. There the
   little road-side church, almost as in his days, still


     ... stands

     Crouching entrench'd in slopes of daisy sod,

     And duly deck'd by Herbert-honouring hands:--

   And here--suffering also from advancing consumption,--he lived that
   saintly life of 'detachment' which his poems reveal--say rather,
   embody. When no longer able to walk to Salisbury Cathedral he would
   take his lute and play: The Sundays of Man's Life ([226]XLIII), being
   the lines which he chose for his last song here--Singing on earth, as
   Izaak Walton says, such hymns and anthems as the Angels and he, and his
   holy friend N. Ferrar now sing in Heaven. He lies nameless beneath the
   altar in his little church at Bemerton.

   For many details in this sketch, as in those of Marvell, Vaughan, and
   others, the writer is indebted to those careful editions of their works
   by which Dr. A. Grosart has conferred services of high value upon our
   literature.

   This sonnet, (to which a title has been prefixed, whilst for the rest
   of Herbert's his own have been retained), was sent by him to his Mother
   as a New Year's gift in 1608--Herbert's first year at Cambridge--in
   order, he says, to declare his resolution 'That my poor abilities in
   poetry shall be all and ever consecrated to God's glory.'

   [227]30 XLI

   The idea here is that costly monuments keep the dust of the body
   artificially apart from its natural companion, the dust of the earth;
   and that tombs will at the Last Day fall and do homage to the dead.
   Dust is the head of man's stem or pedigree; his life, like the sand
   contained in the hour-glass, is destined in its turn to dust.

   The appearance of a church interior, in the early seventeenth century,
   is admirably characterized in this and the following poem.

   [228]32 XLV

   Herbert seems to have written this curious autobiographical poem when
   in ill-health or low spirits, and in remembrance of a time of morbid
   depression ([229]St. vi).

   [230]33 --

   [231]l. 1 My flesh began ... appears equivalent to challenged. [232]l.
   17 cross-bias: an image from bowling, when a ball sent on a curve
   strikes the opponent's aside. The 'conceit' in the last line may mean;
   Although forgotten of God, unless my love to Him still continues in my
   desolation, let me never be able to love Him.

   [236]St. i 'The aspects of the planets were their apparent positions in
   regard to one another as seen' and calculated beforehand 'from the
   earth' (Grosart). Upon these aspects astronomy greatly relied for its
   predictions. [237]St. iii The chemist analyses the creature, the
   substance before him,--until he discovers its callow, simple,
   unclothed, elements; which are only seen by ordinary spectators dressed
   out and disguised within the composite substance presented to the
   senses. In this poem we trace Herbert's friendship and co-operation
   with Francis Bacon.

   [238]46 LXI

   This lovely poem, which, as the reader will find, must have been
   studied as a model by Vaughan, was clearly written after a time of
   depression--due, perhaps, to the increasing ill-health of Herbert's
   later years; the 'consumption' alluded to by Izaak Walton in his Life.
   [239]St. i, l. 3 demesne: seemingly used for property; the flowers,
   beside what their spot of earth grants them, gain joy through the
   contrast of Spring after frost. To the metrical skill and beauty of l.
   4 S. T. Coleridge draws attention. [240]St. iii chiming ... bell:
   calling to prayer. [241]St. iv Offering at Heaven: compare Vergil's
   equally charming phrase on a young tree's growth,

   [242]St. vii l. 6 Swelling through store: puffed up by wealth or place.

   [243]49 LXVII

   Archbishop Leighton, as quoted by Dr. Grosart, has a remark which
   appears tacitly to refer to this poem, and explains its title.
   'Whatsoever be the matter of [human actions], the spiritual mind hath
   that alchemy indeed of turning base metals into gold, earthly
   employments into heavenly.'--[244]Tincture (p. 50, St. i) may refer to
   the Elixir, regarded as a cleansing or transmuting liquid. But the more
   obvious sense will be, 'if coloured or tinged with this thought, For
   God's sake.'

   'This Hymn was made by Sir H. Wotton, when he was an Ambassador at

   Provost of Eton: whence in 1638 he wrote to Milton, then in his youth,
   an admirable letter, congratulating him on the beauty of Comus, and
   giving counsel derived from his own experience, for Milton's Italian
   journey.

   Milton imagined this magnificent Ode at dawn of Christmas 1629,--having
   then lately passed his 21st birthday. He here treats Nature ([250]p.
   61, St. ii, iii) as guilty,--as representing a fallen world. The
   heathen religions of antiquity are similarly regarded as demon-worship,
   rather than the corruptions of, or the efforts to reach, divine truth:
   and the tradition that the power of the pagan Gods ended at the
   Nativity is worked out at length. He begins with the deities of Greece
   and Rome, passing thence to Syria and Egypt.

   offers.

   Sir Thomas Browne was educated at Winchester and Broadgate Hall, (now
   Pembroke College), Oxford. Became M.D. at Leyden, and settled as a
   physician in Norwich. The Religio Medici, (whence the hymn printed is
   taken), his most famous work, was first published 1642. Passages in
   this and in his Hydriotaphia are amongst the very finest efforts of
   English prose. He was honoured by Dr. Johnson with a short biography.

   [262]69 LXXXVIII

   Thomas Pestel was a Chaplain to Charles I. Mr. W. T. Brooke, (see
   [263]note on XII), publishes this from his Sermons. The next he dates
   1660: It makes us wish, he justly observes, that 'more of Pestel's work
   had survived.'

   [264]71 XC

   Of Robert Herrick's life, again, very little has survived. Probably
   trained in Westminster School, he went thence to S. John's and Trinity
   Hall, Cambridge. Some years he then seems to have spent in London: in
   1629 becoming Vicar of Dean Prior, a sequestered Devon village not far
   from Totnes. Ejected thence for the heresy or 'malignity' (as
   triumphant Puritanism named it) of remaining loyal to his Church and
   King, he published his one volume of sacred and secular song: was
   restored to his Vicarage in 1662, and lies buried at Dean Prior.

   Herrick is in the first rank of English lyric poets. In virtue of his
   airy touch, his fluent melody, his simple directness of style, his
   graceful lucidity, he may be called an Elizabethan born out of his age.
   But his range of subjects, his exquisite pictures of country life (see
   [265]XCIV), his union of humour with seriousness ([266]XCV), mark the
   gradual development of our lyrical poetry, and its enfranchisement from
   Renaissance limitations, during the Stuart period.

   [267]75 XCVI

   Mildmay Fane, second Earl of Westmoreland, was friend of Herrick, who
   dedicated to him his beautiful Harvest Home picture, The Hock-cart, and
   begged the Earl to publish his own verses: which were privately printed
   in 1648.

   [268]76 XCVII

   This and [269]the next are republished by Mr. W. T. Brooke from an
   Anthology of 1677.

   [271]apples (p. 78, l. 17) pin-apples (Grosart).--These emigrants are
   apparently supposed to be flying westward beyond the reach of Laud's
   ecclesiastical administration. But Marvell, at least in youth, held so
   equable an attitude between the contentions of his day, remaining,
   indeed, a lover of the Monarchy at heart, that the motive of the poem
   was probably only chosen to gratify his intense feeling for natural
   scenery and imaginative hyperbole by this lovely picture.

   Andrew Marvell was of Trinity, Cambridge: made the grand tour of those
   days: in 1650-2 taught the little Mary, daughter to General Lord
   Fairfax. In 1657 he was employed with Milton (at his recommendation) as
   a secretary in the Foreign Department of the Protectorate. He entered
   the House of Commons as Member for Hull, 1659, and sate there till his
   death:--in 1663 accompanying the first (Howard) Earl of Carlisle on his
   embassy to 'Muscovy,' and writing much political verse. This is of very
   small value as poetry. But Marvell, when he is great, is among our
   greatest poets in felicity of touch and vividness of penetrative
   imagination. Of this the [272]Coronet (C) is a fine example. Here
   Marvell seems allegorically to shadow forth how hard it is to offer
   human gifts,--such as Poetry,--to Heaven, in a truly disinterested and
   devotional spirit.

   [273]79 CI

   The selection from Vaughan's poetry here given will probably be the
   largest mass of unfamiliar verse to most readers. It is also so
   condensed in style, filled with such strokes of penetrative
   imagination, not without fantastic touches, that it will require the
   careful study which it eminently repays. Rather full notes have been
   therefore added.

   Henry Vaughan was descended from the branch of that ancient and noble
   family settled in Breconshire, which in Roman days formed part of the
   region Siluria: whence the Poet always signs himself Silurist. He was
   born at Scethrog (properly Ysgythrog, peaked, or craggy), near Usk,
   between Crickhowel and Brecon: in 1638 entered Jesus College, Oxford:
   thence went to London, where he was familiar with men of letters: took
   the degree of Doctor of Medicine: by 1647 practised at Scethrog or
   Newton, where his Silex Scintillans (Spark-giving Flintstone),
   published 1650 and 1655, Thalia Rediviva, 1678, and other books were
   written. Except that he married and had children nothing is known of
   the poet-physician's long life in his native place: only the tombstone
   in his parish church-yard of Llansantfraed records--'Henricus Vaughan
   M.D. | Siluris: | Servus inutilis | Peccator maximus | Hic jaceo |
   Gloria! + miserere.'--To this good man's humble confession let us,
   however, allow ourselves to add his ancient family motto: 'Safe is the
   owner of a clear Conscience.'

   [274]80 CII

   Wordsworth, who owned a copy of the very rare Silex Scintillans, may
   have had this poem before him when writing his Ode upon Intimations of
   Immortality.--Vaughan's my glorious train answering to the trailing
   clouds of glory ... of the later Poet.

   [275]82 CV

   An excellent example of the writer's skill in blending natural scenery
   with moral and religious thought:--It may be compared with the power of
   uniting figure-subjects with landscape which a few painters, (notably
   our own G. Mason), have shown.

   The omnipresence of God in Nature is almost more constant and
   consistent in Vaughan's poetry than in Wordsworth's. Equally
   characteristic is the intensely imaginative picture of the higher
   heavens, the wide sweep of Vaughan's brush in painting them,
   exemplified in [276]St. iv, l. 5, 6.

   [277]83 CVI

   [278]Man ... flowers;--so in the only Original text of 1650. Ingenious
   conjecture has here read and ... flowers, Angels ... But the phrase as
   it stands is quite Vaughan's manner and gives sense. On the principles
   of safe emendatory criticism, it should therefore be left undisturbed.

   [279]84 CIX

   [280]l. 16 cheap book: probably for chap-book.--[281]p. 85, l. 4: the
   sense may be 'I strove long against the purifying and
   conscience-awakening doctrines of Holy Scripture.'

   [282]89 CXVI

   It is obviously against the persecutions and grinding tyranny,
   (stigmatized by Hallam with honest wrath, but disingenuously extenuated
   by more than one writer of our day), suffered by the country at the
   hand of the Puritans and Cromwell, that Vaughan (1655) makes this
   beautiful protest.

   [283]91 CXVIII

   The original title is--Rom. Cap. 8. ver. 19. Etenim res Creatae exerto
   Capite observantes expectant revelationem Filiorum Dei. This seems to
   be a version framed by Vaughan to suit the imagery of this eminently
   characteristic poem;--the Vulgate giving Nam expectatio creaturae,
   revelationem filiorum Dei expectat.

   [284]95 CXXII

   What breadth of sympathy,--what a strange power of living (as it were)
   the very life of Nature,--what eager tenderness and humanity,--in this
   most original poem!--It should be compared with the singular history of
   a Book, given in [285]CVIII.--Realism, in Vaughan, is penetrated, or,
   rather, identified, with Idealism.

   [286]98 CXXVI

   [287]l. 17-20, This ... rack: some confusion or misreading must be
   here. The syntax becomes clearer if we place l. 19, 20 after l. 16, and
   suppose made understood after the were now of l. 15. Yet this
   transposition seems to weaken the contrast drawn between the fall of
   Salem and the glorification of Bethlem.

   [288]100 CXXIX

   [289]Magdal-castle: the Magdala whence Mary has been called was
   probably the Migdol (Tower) near Tiberias, where the remains of a
   watch-tower still exist. The name Magdalene may however mean 'the
   twiner or plaiter of hair,' and this interpretation possibly induced
   Vaughan to dwell so fully on the point. He returned to the subject in
   some lovely lines of his Thalia Rediviva (1678), where, in the
   description of a Beauty, he says


     Her hair laid out in curious setts

     And twists, doth show like silken nets,

     Where--since he play'd at hit or miss--

     The god of Love her pris'ner is,

     And fluttering with his skittish wings

     Puts all her locks in curls and rings.

   It should be remembered that the identification whether of Mary of
   Magdala or Mary of Bethany with the Sinner of S. Luke vii is only
   conjectural, if not improbable.--Whether Vaughan was aware or not of
   this, he has left us no more curious and original poem than his Mary
   Magdalen, a figure as vivid, life-like, and quaint as one in a
   mediaeval missal.

   [290]106 CXXXIV

   [291]for one twenty ... Possibly, common insensate things may outlast
   one who has lived twenty years; referring to the life-time of the
   unknown youth lamented in this pathetic poem:--to which, as to the
   following, Vaughan has prefixed no title.

   [292]108 CXXXV

   [293]St. vi. l. 3 well: dell has been conjectured, but the Welsh
   ffynnon stands for fountain or for springhead, and may have influenced
   Vaughan to use well in the sense of watery recess.

   [294]111 CXXXIX

   From Crashaw to Norris ([295]CL) we are in the strange, attractive,
   remote region of mysticism and ecstasy, having its origin in Plato, but
   probably drawing more from Philo, Plotinus, and later sources. Oxford
   in the fifteenth century had her Renaissance movement, which has
   profoundly affected England ever since. The Cambridge Platonist
   movement was less diffused, less enduring:--yet it deserves study, not
   only as a singular exhibition of a phase which constantly recurs in the
   human mind, but from the merit of the literature which it has left.

   Richard Crashaw, from the lately-founded Charter House, entered
   Cambridge in 1631, passing from Pembroke to Peterhouse: was ejected in
   1644 with many more who refused to bow down before the Scottish
   Covenant:--that transient idol which the Presbyterian party had set up
   and was trying to force upon reluctant England. He joined the Roman
   Communion about 1646, in which year his little volume of English poetry
   was published: Soon retired to France; thence to Rome: was made Canon
   in the Basilica Church of our Lady in Loreto, where he presently died
   and was buried.

   Crashaw represents sensuous Mysticism, as the three poets who follow
   are intellectual mystics. Like Quarles, (though not to the same
   degree), he quits the ideal point of view, the high Platonic aether. We
   cannot say of him, as has been said of that 'Son of Light,' Origen, the
   great founder of Christian Mysticism, that he 'is never betrayed into
   the imagery of earthly passion used by the monastic writers,' and which
   also marked the style of the Italian Marino, from whose Herod Crashaw
   has left a brilliant paraphrase.

   Yet this mode of feeling has its place; it also demands and deserves
   its compartment in a Sacred Anthology. Crashaw's work in poetry, as a
   whole, is incomplete and irregular; Pope, whilst praising him, was
   correct in recognizing that he was an amateur rather than an artist. It
   was the same with Marvell:--neither, one would say, did justice to his
   fine natural gift. But Crashaw has a charm so unique, an imagination so
   nimble and subtle, phrases of such sweet and passionate felicity, that
   readers who may be tempted by the very scanty specimens which alone it
   has been here possible to offer, to turn to his little book, will find
   themselves surprised and delighted, in proportion to their sympathetic
   sense of Poetry, when touched to its rarer and finer issues.

   [296]St. i. l. 4 wake the Sun: So in the popular mediaeval hymn Verbum

   Joseph Beaumont, born of that Leicestershire family which rivals the
   Tennysons of Lincolnshire in poetical fertility, was educated at
   Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he began that immense range of study which
   was characteristic of the 'Polymaths' of the seventeenth century. With
   his friend Crashaw thrust forth in 1644, he retired to Hadleigh, where
   he wrote his Psyche, or Love's Mystery,--an allegory of Life filling
   between thirty and forty thousand lines. Beaumont's later years,
   despite the political troubles of his time, were prosperous: be made a
   happy marriage (1650), and after 1660 became Head of Jesus and of his
   old College successively: Regius Professor of Divinity in 1674.
   Thenceforward he seems to have lived and worked at Peterhouse, where
   his epitaph in the Chapel still commemorates him as


     Poeta, Orator, Theologus praestantissimus.

   The pieces here printed, (which do not represent the mystical style of
   the Psyche), belong to 1652: [298]CXLIV was doubtless suggested by the
   contrast of Beaumont's home-happiness in quiet Hadleigh, and the
   wretched state of England under the Commonwealth, and is a lesson as
   true for the nineteenth century as the seventeenth.

   [299]117 CXLVII

   Henry More, the most interesting figure among our poetical mystics,
   went from Eton to Christ's, Cambridge, where he lived an ideal
   student's life among books, friends, and disciples, yet distinguished
   also for charitable deeds.

   In youth he passed through a stage of bewildered thought, accompanied
   with the common miseries of scepticism, which he described in a few
   powerful lines,--till he reached clear vision;


     Nun de t' Eros me pteroisi theossutos exupereidei,

     Nux apebe men unar te ...

   --blessed henceforward with a firm happy philosophic Christian
   faith,--which in mode of expression was influenced not only by Plato
   and his later mystical followers, but by the mediaeval Theologia
   Germanica, by Ficino of Florence,--(probably in his Theologia
   Platonica)--and Descartes, then the leading thinker in Europe. But he
   moved through this labyrinth of speculation, safe in the singleness of
   heart, the Monocardia, as he terms it,--the faithfulness to the 'Good
   and the True,'--to the Sincerity which, (as on his death-bed 'he
   professed with tears' to the friend who watched by him), had been his
   lifelong pursuit. More's 'unwavering allegiance to reason,' which he
   held 'the glory and adornment of all true religion, and the special
   prerogative of Christianity' was 'the counterbalancing principle' in
   his mind to his mystical theories: (J. H. Overton, The Church in the
   Eighteenth Century).

   R. Southey remarks on More that 'as a poet,--strange and sometimes
   unreadably uncouth as he is, there are lines and passages of the
   highest feeling and most exquisite beauty.' His many poems cannot in
   his own age have been popular, and will never be so. Yet it is
   impossible to glance at them without an impression of strange
   imaginative force, of singular and delightful depth of mystical
   conviction.

   The two remarkable philosophical flights here chosen are briefer, not
   lower, than More's more sustained poems. Difficult at first sight from
   their weight of condensed thought, from the remoteness of the ideas
   presented, they remind of the passionate power, the imaginative fury,
   of Lucretius:--but their Christian Platonism lifts them in tone into a
   larger aether, regions happier and higher, than could be reached by the
   pupil of Empedocles and Epicurus.

   [300]120 CXLIX

   In St. i. the order of l. 3 and 4 has been conjecturally transposed.

   John Norris was educated at Winchester and Exeter College, and Fellow
   of All Souls, Oxford. He held the living of Bemerton, formerly G.
   Herbert's, (1691). 'That old and tranquil parsonage was to him a happy
   hiding place:' and Bene latuit is his fitting epitaph.--Norris wrote
   much and ably on metaphysical subjects: was greatly influenced by the
   Cambridge Platonists, More and Cudworth. His poems were published 1684,
   and passed through a tenth edition by 1730:--one proof, out of many,
   how exaggerated is the criticism which describes that period as devoid
   of inner life and spiritual aspiration.

   Norris may be reckoned the last among our Christian Platonists of the
   seventeenth century. He has 'the same noble tone of spiritualised
   thought and wistful, imaginative, speculation, and a like golden haze
   over it all' (C. J. Abbey):--not without some share in the fancifulness
   and overstrain prevalent in his day.

   [301]121 CLI

   Francis Quarles, son to a country gentleman of Romford: educated at
   Christ's, Cambridge: studied at Lincoln's Inn: was for a time secretary
   to Archbishop Usher in Ireland, but lived mainly as an author,
   publishing much in verse and prose from 1620 onward. He was a devoted
   royalist, and suffered accordingly:--dying of grief, it is said, at the
   robbery and destruction of his library.

   The inconstancy of Fame has no better example than Quarles. He
   moralizes his song too much; this work is marred by fantastical lapses
   from good taste; by a fatal facility. Yet,--unless indeed a man's
   performance, when he has had free play, is always the measure of his
   natural gift,--Quarles has written so well, so sincerely, sometimes,
   (see [302]CLI), so fervently,--that had he remembered how, in Poetry,
   Matter, however good, is of no ultimate avail without adequate Art, he
   might, we may easily believe, have deserved to retain some part of that
   immense popularity which he enjoyed among his contemporaries.

   [303]125 CLV

   George Wither, educated at Magdalen, Oxford, was a lawyer; served on
   both sides in the Civil War; made a Major General by Cromwell, but was
   deprived of his spoils after the Restoration.--'His best poems,' says
   Hallam, 'were published in 1622, with the title of Mistress of
   Philarete. Some of them are highly beautiful ... I think there is
   hardly anything in our lyric poetry of [that] period equal to his lines
   on his Muse.' But this promise was swamped by false fluency and the
   'grovelling puritanism into which he afterwards fell.'

   [304]126 CLVII

   Jeremy Taylor: Educated at Caius, Cambridge: made Fellow of All Souls,
   Oxford, by favour of Archbishop Laud: was imprisoned for his support of
   Charles I: lived poor and retiredly in Wales, but was once or twice
   more imprisoned:--moved to Lisburn and in 1660 was made Bishop of Down
   and Connor,--with Dromore, where he was buried, in addition. He united
   learning and fervent eloquence perhaps more than any other English
   writer.

   [305]128 CLIX

   Richard Baxter: A man eminent for candour, charity, and goodness, but
   inconsistent and wavering in his public career during the evil days of
   the Civil War, Protectorate, and Restoration. He was a very voluminous
   polemical writer, but best known in his own day and since through his
   excellent manuals of practical piety. 'Read any of his works; they are
   all good,' said Dr. Johnson to Boswell.

   [306]-- CLX

   Samuel Crossman: Educated at Pembroke, Oxford: was ejected from his
   rectory in Essex for nonconformity in 1662: returned to the Church, and
   died Dean of Bristol. His Sacred Poems were published 1664.

   [307]130 CLXII

   John Austin: Entered S. John's, Cambridge; left in 1640, on joining the
   Roman Communion; qualified for the Bar. This hymn was published 1668 in
   his Offices.

   [308]134 CLXVII

   My Lord, my Love--translated from a phrase of S. Ignatius--'O emos Eros
   estaurotai.

   John Mason, of Clare Hall, Cambridge, was some time Vicar of Water
   Stratford; but fell into strange aberrations, which, according to W. T.
   Brooke's conjecture, ended in religious mania.--His Spiritual Songs are
   dated 1683.

   [309]136 CLXX

   Thomas Shepherd: for a short time a clergyman in Buckinghamshire;
   afterwards Congregational Minister at Northampton and Bocking. With an
   edition of J. Mason's Songs of Praise, he published Penitential Cries,
   1692.

  INTRODUCTION TO [310]BOOK II

   The changes which occur in poetical style, as we have noticed, are
   marked less strongly upon our religious than on our secular song. Yet
   something of the clear diction and the easy metrical flow of Pope is
   traceable in the hymns of Addison: whilst the plain, even the prosaic,
   manner of De Foe has a counterpart in Ken's writing. But the didactic
   tone, the repressed undercurrent of feeling, which in many ways colour
   our secular poetry during the second and third quarters of the
   eighteenth century, in religious verse soon gave way before what is
   generally known as the Evangelical movement. This in some degree was
   doubtless a reaction towards warmth, enthusiasm, and (as we might say)
   Nature, from the argumentative habit, the constant appeal to reason and
   common sense, the studied moderation of tone, which were the general
   tendencies of the time.--But the motives and men by whom the religious
   school in question was led from Watts, Toplady, and the Wesleys, to
   Cowper,--its strength and its weakness--need not here be dwelt on.
   Suffice it to note that the poetry of the full-charged heart now found
   vent and relief, not in imaginative ode or didactic meditation but in
   the form of hymns; amongst which many of the most beautiful, not less
   than the most practically precious, poems of that class existing in any
   literature, are found. These hymns indeed have often, to modern eyes, a
   conventional style, due to two causes: the phraseology common to the
   Evangelical school, and the general literary manner of the time. But
   the manner of one age is always the conventionality of the next: and
   they to whom this quality is repulsive in our eighteenth-century
   writers should remember that the styles which seem natural to us will
   probably, under the same law, seem artificial to those who live in the
   'summers that we shall not see.'

   PAGE   NO.

   [311]138 CLXXII

   Abraham Cowley, of Westminster School and Trinity, Cambridge: a
   supporter of Charles I and his Queen:--by his contemporaries (and
   Milton's) held the greatest poet of his time. But cleverness and sense,
   both of which he has to a very high degree, when wanting good taste and
   that indescribable something which eternally severs poetry from verse,
   have long since placed him amongst those writers who are rarely read,
   but never read without profit.

   [312]139 CLXXIV

   [313]the Tyrrhene seas: Addison here obviously refers to a violent
   storm by which, when sailing from Marseille to Italy during December
   1699, he was assailed in the bay of Genoa. His vessel was driven back
   to Monaco, whence he took boat to Savona.

   [314]142 CLXXVII

   Thomas Ken was Scholar of Winchester 1652, Fellow of New College,
   Oxford, by election from school: studied music and physical science in
   addition to the ordinary subjects. Was chosen Fellow of Winchester, and
   Prebendary (1669): resided there for some years and wrote his famous
   Manual of Prayers (1675). Chaplain at the Hague to Princess Mary:
   consecrated Bishop of Bath and Wells 1685, at the special choice of
   Charles II, who honoured the courage of 'the little black fellow who
   would not give poor Nelly [Gwyn] a lodging' in his house at Winchester.

   After Monmouth's invasion Ken saved the lives of many rebels: as Bishop
   he gave away his whole income, and was unbounded in kindness and aid to
   the poor. In 1688 he was one of the Seven Bishops who resisted James
   II: but, with much hesitation, found himself unable to take the Oath
   required by William III, and was deprived of his See in 1691.
   Henceforth he lived mostly in personal poverty at Longleat; troubled
   often by Nonjuring disputants and failing health; yet comforted by many
   friendships with old and young: for, childless himself, like Watts and
   Keble, he was distinguished by love for children. He received unfailing
   and reverent kindness from Lord Weymouth, under whose roof he died, and
   was buried at Frome Selwood, the nearest village in his old diocese.

   Poetry more absolutely sincere, more high-minded than Bishop Ken's,
   does not exist. But heaviness of style, prolixity, want of charm and of
   variety, has sunk most of his work irretrievably. It is but the
   selection of a selection which is here offered. Three justly-famous
   Hymns have, however, been printed in full. The curious textual
   questions connected with them have been discussed by Dean Plumptre of
   Wells in his admirable Life of Ken (1888):--a book which puts the man
   and his age before us with singular vividness. The text given in Ken's
   Manual for Winchester College, 1695, has been followed, with a few
   alterations from his revised edition of 1709.

   [315]150 CLXXXV

   Ken for many years before his death suffered grievously from rheumatism
   and other disorders, resorting to Bath and Clifton for relief. But
   disease grew upon him, and his latter days were overshadowed by
   terrible tortures. This poem,--beautiful from its simplicity and depth
   of pathos, (as [316]CLXXXVI through its dramatic
   straightforwardness),--with others is ascribed by Dean Plumptre to this
   melancholy period. Ken says himself:--


     I some remission of my woes

     Feel, while I hymns compose.

   [317]152 CLXXXVII

   Nahum Tate: at Trinity, Dublin: Poet Laureate after Shadwell; friend of
   Dryden. He translated the Psalms in conjunction with Dr. Brady, and has
   been criticized too severely for failing of success in a task where to
   succeed was impossible.

   [318]153 CLXXXVIII

   John Pomfret: of Queen's, Cambridge, and Rector of Malden,
   Bedfordshire. This little song is an oasis in a wilderness of
   commonplace.

   [319]-- CLXXXIX

   Isaac Watts received a thorough classical education, and entered the
   'Independent' ministry. His health failed in 1712 and the rest of his
   life he passed in Sir T. Abney's house; dying there of old age; after
   long and devoted work to his flock and literature. He was buried in
   Bunhill Fields.

   Watts may be counted (if we exclude Milton), as one of the earliest
   well-read and scholarly students among the nonconformists. His views as
   an Independent were modified and enlarged by his sweet devout temper;
   may we not add,--by his gift in poetry? And 'every Christian church,'
   as Dr. Johnson finely remarked, 'would rejoice to have adopted' one so
   fervently devout, so faithful to his duty,--we may add, so much more
   truly gifted by nature as a poet, than common Fame has recognized. As
   with C. Wesley and other good men, fluency, want of taste and finish,
   the sacrifice, in a word, of Art to direct usefulness, have probably
   lost them those honours in literature to which they were born. But they
   have their reward.

   [320]156 CXCIII

   The Calvinism within which the tender-hearted Watts was bound captive
   is doubtless too perceptible in this beautiful lyric. A similar vein of
   feeling may, however, be traced, centuries before, in that 'apathy'
   which S. Clement of Alexandria ascribes to the perfect Christian, who
   is 'so absorbed in the Divine Love that he can no longer be said to
   love his fellow-creatures, in the ordinary sense of the word.' Yet as
   we learn, (Bigg, The Christian Platonists of Alexandria), how 'there
   were many in Clement's own time who shrank from that too ethereal
   ideal, which, to use his own phrase, touches earth with but one foot,'
   so in this hymn the gracious spirit of Poetry seems to soften the grim
   atmosphere of Geneva.

   [321]158 CXCVII

   The admirable author of this hymn almost apologized for publishing it.
   Yet few child-pictures have been drawn in words or colours of more
   perfect tenderness.

   [322]159 CXCVIII

   Philip Doddridge: a nonconformist minister of much and varied reading:
   Head of a theological College at Northampton: a greatly esteemed and
   popular author of his day: died and was buried at Lisbon.

   [323]151 CCII

   John Byrom: trained at Merchant Taylors' and Trinity, Cambridge: his
   first publication was a Pastoral in the Spectator. After early poverty,
   he lived a retired blameless literary life on his property by
   Manchester. One of the many men of strong feeling in whom faith burned
   like 'a hidden flame' through the eighteenth century.

   [324]162 CCIII

   Christopher Smart: student and fellow of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge: His
   life was one of literature actively followed as a profession; didactic,
   satirical, and religious. But his work is singularly unequal: only
   under the stress of illness and mental overexcitement did he reach the
   level of serious genius shown in our two specimens. Smart was eminent
   for wit, conviviality, kindliness, and carelessness, valued as a friend
   by men like Johnson and Garrick:--a type of one who has 'no enemy but
   himself.'

   During a severe illness (1754-1756) Smart's mind partially failed:
   whilst in confinement he is believed to have written the 'Song to
   David' which he published in 1763:--the Hymn on his Recovery has been
   dated about 1756. It seems that he never regained full sanity, although
   the disease was rather eccentricity than madness: and despite hard
   labour, be died under confinement for debt.

   'My poor friend Smart,' Dr. Johnson said to Boswell, in 1763, 'showed
   the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his
   prayers in the street.... Now although, rationally speaking, it is
   greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am
   afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is
   not called in question.'

   Some traces of Smart's excited spirit are visible in [325]CCIII:--far
   more in [326]CCIV, which may be described in a phrase of C. Lamb's as
   'a kind of medley between inspiration and possession'; and in its noble
   wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness, from Earth to
   Heaven, is unique in our Poetry. It has been greatly abridged as here
   printed.

   [327]166 CCV

   Michael Bruce: born and bred near Lochleven in Fifeshire: well educated
   in the village school, where he was a typical specimen of the poor,
   brave, Scottish student of those days, who could find in Latin
   literature lifelong strength and enlightenment and culture. Bruce was
   next at the University of Edinburgh (1762) in company with John Logan:
   teaching during his vacations, and after in the country schools of his
   native district. But this life was too hard for him: consumption set
   in, and he died in his sleep at twenty-one:--his copy of Holy
   Scripture,--turned down at the text Weep ye not for the dead... beside
   him.

   Immediately after the death of Bruce, Logan secured all his papers.
   What followed has been the subject of much controversy. But the Editor
   cannot resist the conclusion that Logan, (whose after career was
   unsatisfactory), managed to gain himself credit for the authorship of
   most of his fellow-student's poems;--publishing them with more or less
   verbal alteration, and destroying all the original manuscripts. Yet,
   even as we have them, their grace, music, fine descriptive skill, and
   spiritual feeling, sufficiently prove that, had longer years been
   granted him, Michael Bruce might have fulfilled the renown of which his
   youth gave promise so remarkable.

   [328]168 CCVIII

   Thomas Olivers: A shoemaker by trade; converted from a dissolute life
   by Whitefield's preaching, he became, first, a zealous assistant of
   John Wesley, and then was employed in his printing-office.

   The musical service in a Synagogue at Westminster suggested to Olivers
   the noble Ode here printed: (C. J. Abbey).

   [329]170 CCIX

   Augustus Montague Toplady: of Westminster School and Trinity, Dublin:
   sometime Vicar of Broadhembury, Devon: published his hymns in 1776. A
   zealous Calvinist; studied and wrote much: powerfully and bitterly
   opposing John Wesley. But his fervour of nature, when directed to
   worthier purpose, inspired Toplady with this splendid Lyric; which, in
   beauty and intensity of feeling, has a rival in [330]CCXII,--a hymn
   truly sublime through the simplicity of its absolute self-surrender.

   [331]-- CCX

   [332]the balance: Toplady seems here to have had in view a phrase from
   the famous hymn, Vexilla Regis, by Fortunatus the sixth-century
   poet,--who describes the Cross, whilst bearing the Saviour's Body, as
   Statera facta saeculi:--'His Body there in balance lay,' in J. Keble's
   version.

   [333]172 CCXV

   Charles Wesley; younger brother to John: At Westminster School; Student
   of Christ Church, Oxford, where he worked diligently: was ordained;
   went on a short mission to the Indians of Georgia; afterwards, a
   Methodist preacher in England.

   The dramatic vividness and fervour of this lyrical Monologue (founded
   upon Genesis xxxii)--the music and consoling sweetness of faith in
   [334]CCXXI, may justify the opinion on the Hymnist's natural gift
   expressed in the previous Note upon Watts; who, with the charming
   candour natural to him, said, 'It was worth all the works he himself
   had written.'

   In the strove and rose (St. [335]ix and [336]xi) for striven and risen,
   Wesley, as Archbishop Trench has remarked, adopts a usage found in
   Shakespeare and Milton.

   [337]177 CCXXII

   Philip Skelton:--Scholar in Trinity, Dublin: worked as clergyman at
   Monaghan and elsewhere; being always distinguished for good sense,
   devotedness, self-denial, and success: published much; mostly on
   religious subjects. Retired in old age to Dublin; published his hymns
   in 1784.

   This poem,--much indebted for its beauty to its scientific
   accuracy,--is an interesting example of the practical, the positive,
   spirit for which the eighteenth century has been often inconsiderately
   and indiscriminately censured.

   [338]179 CCXXIII

   John Cennick: For a time, a Calvinistic Methodist; afterwards a
   Moravian preacher:--To this period the hymn printed doubtless belongs.

   [339]-- CCXXIV

   John Newton: Began life as a sailor; was employed in the African
   slave-trade; profligate and miserable, yet worked perseveringly at
   Latin and mathematics. He awoke to the sense of Sin and of Mercy: left
   the sea: studied for Holy Orders: was ordained to the curacy of Olney
   (1765), and became friend of William Cowper. In 1779 Newton was made
   rector of a City church; He had the generosity of a large heart,
   grateful for his conversion to piety and happiness; and hence,
   doubtless, a singular gift in winning his hearers.

   Mere bare simplicity and sincerity suffice to range this hymn amongst
   the most powerful in our Anthology: John Bunyan, or the great
   twelfth-century religious poet, Jacopone of Todi, who wrote the Canzone
   Mirami, Sposa, un poco In sulla Croce ignudo, might have been proud, or
   thankful, to own it.

   [340]182 CCXXVIII-CCXXXII

   These hymns were written at Olney in North Buckinghamshire between
   1771-1779, at the suggestion and under the influence of John Newton.
   That influence was not wholly for good; Assurance of Salvation--a
   cardinal point in the creed of his Calvinist friend,--was physically
   and morally impossible to Cowper's tremulous, sensitive, nature. The
   Hymnal was not far advanced, when he again fell beneath the insanity of
   ten years before. His mind gradually recovered its proper tone:--and
   the jointly-written book, about one-fourth of which is by Cowper, was
   the first by which (1779) he became known as an author.

   [341]183 CCXXXI

   Mr. Abbey, in the excellent Church in the Eighteenth Century, assigns
   this brilliant lyric to J. Newton. It is however, marked C. in the
   first edition of the Olney Hymns,--the sign placed to distinguish
   Cowper's work:--to which, in point of style, it also clearly belongs.

   [342]184 CCXXXIII

   This beautiful poem was written in 1765, at the moment when Cowper,
   after his earliest fit of derangement, was deciding to quit London as
   his home, for ever. That the country, however, could not give lasting
   peace to that delicate and troubled spirit, is shown by the companion
   poem, of at least equal beauty, O happy shades ..., written in
   1773;--apparently whilst the second attack (above noticed) was
   approaching.

   [343]186 CCXXXV

   William Blake: Mr. A. Gilchrist has well recounted the story of this
   singularly attractive poet and painter. A long life could hardly have
   fewer events; only a sixty years' cheerful and happy struggle against
   starvation: but the beautiful soul of the man, devoted to his art and
   his loving wife and his God, gives it an unique interest,--a
   fascination, rarely raised by any biography. And in Blake, more than
   most, the man is identified with the artist; the spell which the life
   holds over the sympathetic reader is renewed and confirmed by the
   poet-painter's designs and verses. The drawing may be often faulty; the
   syntax imperfect; yet there is a subtle simplicity, a tenderness
   springing equally from the heart and the imagination,--sometimes a
   sublimity of idea, which give the best work of Blake's youth a peculiar
   place of its own, high up amongst our 'treasures for ever.'

   The soul of that child-like and celestial painter Fra Angelico, might
   have entered into Blake, (who in 1789 can have known nothing of the
   monastic Italian artist)--when writing this and the two following
   pieces for his Songs of Innocence.

   The work of each was in truth irradiated by mystic inward enthusiasm,
   by constant presence of the spiritual life, by intensity of vision:--To
   men of this class the Invisible world is the Visible,--the
   Supernatural, was the Real.

   [344]188 CCXXXIX

   James Montgomery: son to a Moravian missionary: edited a newspaper at
   Sheffield; wrote much verse: published his hymns in 1853:--the period
   to which CCXXXIX may conjecturally be assigned.

   [345]190 CCXLII

   Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Grant: Educated at Magdalene, Cambridge: then sat
   in the House of Commons for several years: Governor of Bombay from 1834
   to his death.--The two hymns here printed have a simple directness of
   thought and expression worthy of our Elizabethan poets.

   [346]192 CCXLIV

   Anna Laetitia Barbauld: daughter to Dr. Aikin: established a school
   near Diss: wrote on Education: Distinguished and loved for a truly
   highminded and sympathetic nature.

  [347]INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III

   Our Second Book ranges from about 1680 to 1820. By this latter date
   that fertile outburst of poetry, which gave a brilliance to the first
   half of this century, second only to that of the Elizabethan age, had
   fully established itself. And already also the dominant schools of
   religious thought and practice familiar to us all, (from whatever angle
   of view we may estimate them), were working their way to the surface.
   There is now sufficient general acquiescence in regard to the character
   of the Evangelical movement to render discussion of it here
   unnecessary. An opposite reason dispenses with any critical sketch of
   the modes of thought upon religion which are represented in this Third
   Book. Attention may however be called to the close parallelism between
   the impulses which, respectively, supplied their wealth of poetic
   material and inspiration to Herbert and Vaughan, and, in our own day,
   to the two admirable writers who hold a place similar to theirs in this
   section of our anthology.

   [348]194 CCXLVI

   Reginald Heber: At Brasenose, Oxford, and early distinguished for
   brilliant ability and energy. Was appointed in 1822 Bishop of Calcutta,
   where he worked with equal devotion and success, till apoplexy cut him
   off at Trichinopoli.--In poetical style he was our last eminent
   representative of Pope and Addison.

   [349]199 CCLVI

   Henry Hart Milman, of Eton and Brasenose, Oxford: author of several
   plays, poems and histories, ably written in a somewhat artificial
   style. Professor of Poetry at Oxford, 1821. Canon of Westminster and
   Dean of S. Paul's.--The hymns here given were published, together with
   those by Bishop Heber, in 1827.

   [350]200 CCLVIII

   All the poems selected from Wordsworth belong to the later half of his
   life, with exception of [351]CCLXIV, which was 'composed on the beach
   near Calais,' 1802.

   [352]207 CCLXVII-CCLXXXIX

   are from the Christian Year, published 1827.

   John Keble, educated by his father, before his fifteenth birthday was
   elected Scholar of Corpus, Oxford: First Class in the Classical and
   Mathematical Schools, 1810: Fellow of Oriel, 1811: ordained Priest
   1816, when be asked a friend to 'pray for me that I may free myself
   from all pride, all ambition, all uncharitableness':--The prayer was
   granted, and it may form the motto for Keble's long, useful, and
   saintly life. He was chosen unanimously Professor of Poetry at Oxford
   1831: settled as Vicar at Hursley near Winchester 1835, where his days
   henceforth were passed, divided between prose and poetry and the devout
   performance of duty: resting by his beloved wife at last in the peace
   of his own green churchyard, beside the church rebuilt by him from the
   proceeds of the Christian Year.

   Keble's work as a co-operator with J. H. (Cardinal) Newman, Dr. Pusey,
   and others, in the religious movement to which his poetry gave its
   earliest definite character is, perhaps, sufficiently illustrated in
   the selection here offered.

   [353]209 CCLXIX

   [354]St. ii l. 2 blossoms red and bright: the original note says,
   'Rhododendrons': but was afterwards correctcd to 'Oleanders.'--[355]St.
   v, vi, vii: the meaning is, Turn from the world to Christ.

   [356]213 CCLXXII

   In refinement of feeling for nature, in the human, sympathetic attitude
   towards things inanimate, and again, in the sense how often these are
   more happily gifted than mankind, we are here closely reminded of
   Vaughan. Yet it is hardly probable that his very rare little books
   should have fallen in Keble's way by 1827.

   No essay on Keble as a poet would be in place here. Yet it may be
   noticed that, like Vaughan, his work, if not always clear either in its
   main lines or its phrases, is filled with admirable imaginative
   touches, with true and tender felicities, which deserve and reward
   readers,--careful, devoted, it might almost be said, microscopic.

   [357]218 CCLXXV

   [358]They say ... crown: the author here refers in a note to Bishop
   Jeremy Taylor, Holy Living, c. xi, sect. 3.

   [359]219 CCLXXVII

   These beautiful stanzas, said Mr. Keble's wife, on the day of his
   death, 'I know were in his dying thoughts.' She survived him but a few
   weeks.

   [360]221 CCLXXIX

   [361]St. iv We change our posture: so Dante (Purg. vi, 149) compares
   Florence, in her sick state, to


     quella inferma

     Che non può trovar posa in su le piume,

     Ma con dar volta suo dolore scherma.

   [362]234 CCXC

   Richard Chenevix Trench: Born at Dublin, educated at Trinity,
   Cambridge. Theological Professor at King's College: Dean of
   Westminster, 1856: Archbishop of Dublin, 1864. In Philology and
   Biblical exegesis he ranks high amongst our prose-writers, and his
   poetry is penetrated by the high purity and nobility of his character.

   [363]239 CCXCIX

   Henry Alford: Educated at Ilmington School, and Trinity, Cambridge: of
   which College he became Fellow. A learned Greek Scholar; edited the New
   Testament. Dean of Canterbury, 1857.

   [364]240 CCC

   Hartley Coleridge: eldest son to Samuel Taylor: Scholar of Merton,
   Oxford, and Fellow of Oriel. Lived mostly in the Lake Country, a
   gentle, dreamy man, who from feeble health and want of will failed to
   fulfil the promise of his youth; whilst, in Wordsworth's beautiful
   phrase, Nature preserved for him throughout 'a young lamb's heart among
   the full-grown flocks.'

   [365]241 CCCIII

   Carolina Baroness Nairn: Born (daughter to L. Oliphant) and died at
   Gask in Perthshire. A high-minded woman, whose 'heart was in every good
   and Christian work of her time.'

   The Leal, Faithful. [366]P. 242 sae dear's... It is a hard-fought and
   dearly-won battle, by which sinful man may reach Heaven.

   [367]242 CCCIV

   Henry Francis Lyte: Of Trinity, Dublin: left Ireland for Brixham,
   Devonshire, through ill-health, and died at Nice. Published his Poems
   1833.

   [368]244 CCCVII

   The maid is not dead, but sleepeth, is the Author's motto for these
   very tender and original lines. Mr. Lyte's book has other lyrics, not
   within the scope of this selection, similarly distinguished by pathetic
   delicacy. His style often unites the characteristic merits of Addison
   and of Cowper.

   [369]247 CCCIX

   [370]song that may not die: CCCX is dated, Berryhead, September, 1847.
   The writer died in the following November.

   [371]249 CCCXII-CCCXX

   From the Lyra Innocentium, published 1846: [372]CCCXXI-CCCXXX, from the
   Miscellaneous Poems, written at many different dates.

   [373]254 CCCXVII

   Prefixed are the words 'Make me thereof a little cake first, and bring
   it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.'

   [374]257 CCCXXI

   Dated 1854.

   [375]261 CCCXXVII

   Originally written for the Christian Year, from admission to which its
   personal character probably excluded it. This poem may be placed beside
   the beautiful Ode to Evening by Collins, as one of the rare successes
   of English poetry in the unrhymed lyric.

   [376]262 CCCXXVIII

   Composed 'for the Tomb of the old Biddlecombes, May 24, 1861.'

   [377]263 CCCXXX

   Dated Dec. 8, in Conceptione B.M.V., 1844.' The hymn 'was written for
   the Lyra Innocentium, but withheld from publication at the time, with
   Mr. Keble's consent but against his wish.'

   [378]264 CCCXXXI

   William Barnes, of a family who had held lands in Dorset for centuries,
   was born in a farmhouse within that beautiful Vale of Blackmore upon
   which his poems love to dwell. Educated in the country: at first placed
   in a lawyer's office; then conducted schools at Mere and Dorchester:
   made himself master of many languages, ancient and modern; obtained a
   degree from S. John's, Cambridge. By study and love of the Dorset folk
   and their ancient speech was led to write poems in hope of preserving
   the dialect. Ordained in 1847; in 1862 Rector of Winterbourne Came near
   Dorchester. And there, strenuously to the last doing his duty from
   cottage to cottage, yet studying and writing much on many subjects,
   Barnes' years passed quickly and happily on, till, in full Christian
   hope and peace, he was laid to rest within his little tree-shadowed
   churchyard.

   The poetry of Barnes, like that of Burns, is inseparable from the
   dialect. This, however, (easily as it may be mastered), has barred the
   lyrics of Barnes from their due place amongst the most varied in
   subject, the most perfect in form, the purest and sweetest in tone,
   which our literature contains. Humour and pathos, character and
   landscape, within the limits of the local sphere which he scarcely
   quits, each is at his command: of all modern poets he is the most truly
   and delightfully Idyllic.--The few specimens here given, it is hoped,
   may tempt genuine lovers of poetry to test this criticism for
   themselves:--the writer does not fear their verdict.

   [379]269 CCCXXXVI

   From Poems ... in common English, 1868. It is worthy of Blake at his
   best in its sweet picturesque simplicity.

   [380]270 CCCXXXVII

   Adelaide Anne Procter: daughter to a poet best known as 'Barry
   Cornwall.' Her poems appeared in 1858, 1861, 1862.

   [381]274 CCCXLII

   From Poems, D. M. Main, Glasgow, 1886:--a volume marked by delicate and
   original thought, expressed with simple grace. For his acquaintance
   with the book, the Editor is indebted to Miss C. G. Rossetti.

   [382]279 CCCXLVI

   Published 1849.--Arthur Hugh Clough was educated at Rugby, Scholar of
   Balliol and Fellow of Oriel (1842), Oxford: afterwards in the Education
   Office: died and was buried at Florence.

   [383]-- CCCXLVII

   John Campbell Shairp: born at Houstoun, Linlithgowshire, of an old
   Lowland Scottish family: trained at Edinburgh, Glasgow University, and
   Balliol, Oxford. Worked as Master at Rugby, and afterwards as Professor
   of Humanity at S. Andrews: was there chosen Principal of the United
   Colleges; Elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford (1877).

   [384]282 CCCLI

   Richard Hurrell Froude: At Eton and Oriel, Oxford: friend and
   co-operator with John Keble and John Henry (Cardinal) Newman in their
   movement for religious revival.

   [385]282 CCCLII

   The editor trusts that he has here dealt with the free permission of
   reprinting graciously given him, in a mode which will not be
   disapproved by one to whom, in company with millions, he owes a
   gratitude best expressed by silence,--a reverence such, che nol divia
   sermone.

   [386]289 CCCLXIV

   The singular beauty of the view from the ancient Taurominium near Etna,
   often noticed, called forth from the writer (Ap. 26, 1833), during his
   journey in Sicily, this deeply-felt expression of one among the divers
   morals that Nature can teach. The Messina deals with an analogous
   moral, as the motto given in the author's Verses (1868) shows: Homo
   sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.

   [387]290 CCCLXVI

   The text prefixed is From His mouth came out a sharp two-edged sword.

   [388]293 CCCLXXII

   Originally prefaced by the words of Sophocles, Antigone, 332 -.
   Greek[polla ta deina, kouden anthropou deinoteron pelei,]--Many are the
   wondrous things of Nature, and none is more wondrous than Man.

   [389]294 CCCLXXIV

   Written after the death of Miss Mary Newman. Dr. Pusey (Jan. 1828) says
   of the author that he had 'lost,... after only 24 hours' cessation of
   apparently strong health, his youngest sister. Every consolation, which
   a brother can have, he has most richly--her whole life having been a
   preparation for that hour.'

   It is dated Oxford, April, 1828:--[390]CCCLXXV, Horsepath, September
   29, 1829.

   [391]296 CCCLXXVI

   Dated, The Oratory, 1856; and published in the Author's very impressive
   and pathetic tale of early Christian life in Africa, Callista.

   [392]300 CCCLXXXI

   This and [393]the next following are 'from S. Gregory Nazianzen.'

   [394]-- CCCLXXXIII

   Written At Sea, in the Straits of Bonifazio, between Sardinia and
   Corsica, June 16, 1833.

   [395]303 CCCLXXXVII

   [396]St. vi Whither we rush: Refers to the real motion of the Sun and
   his planets through celestial space.

   [397]304 CCCLXXXVIII

   From Poems and Hymns (1880) by John Sharp, now for more than fifty
   years the much-respected Vicar of Horbury, near Wakefield.

   [398]309 CCCXCV

   Arthur Penrhyn Stanley: son to Edward, Bishop of Norwich: at Rugby
   under Dr. Arnold: Scholar of Balliol, Fellow of University, Oxford:
   Canon of Canterbury, Dean of Westminster, 1863. Best known by his Life
   of Dr. Arnold and works on the history of the Jewish and the Eastern
   Church.

   [399]311 CCCXCVIII

   Christopher Wordsworth: nephew to the Poet: educated at Winchester;
   Fellow of Trinity, Cambridge. Master of Harrow: Bishop of Lincoln,
   1869. Eminent for scholarship and integrity of life.

   [400]313 CCCCII

   Frederick William Faber: of Harrow School and University, Oxford:
   entered the Roman Church in 1845 and established the Oratory of S.
   Philip Neri in London: labouring zealously till his early death. His
   hymns were first published complete in 1862.

   [401]317 CCCCVII

   'Verse sung at the Way of the Cross at the Oratory.'

   [402]-- CCCCVII

   Jesus, our Love: see [403]note on CLXVII.

   [404]318 CCCCVIII

   The poetry of Mr. Richard Wilton, (of S. Catherine's, Cambridge: Rector
   of Londesborough), Woodnotes, 1873, and Lyrics, 1878, deserves wider
   acceptance than it has hitherto received.

   [405]319 CCCCX

   'The East window of Kirkby Wharfe or Grimston Church is filled with
   stained glass,... the subject being the Crucifixion.'

   [406]-- CCCCXI

   From Days and Hours by Frederick Tennyson, 1854:--another noteworthy
   and too-neglected book.

   [407]320 CCCCXII

   Charles Tennyson, born at Somersby, Lincolnshire, next brother to
   Frederick and senior to Alfred, was educated at Louth and Trinity,
   Cambridge: ordained 1835; married a sister of Emily, Lady Tennyson, and
   spent most of his life as Vicar of Grasby in the Wolds,--taking the
   surname of Turner under the will of a relation. His, as his nephew
   Hallam Tennyson truly writes, was an alma beata e bella:--a man of
   noble simplicity, tenderness, purity of heart, 'at once childlike and
   heroic.' The devoted love of his brother Alfred is expressed in the
   beautiful stanzas dated Midnight, June 30, 1879.

   This poet was master of what may be termed the Idyllic sonnet; under
   which form he gave many pictures of his country and its indwellers,
   with his thoughts upon this and the other life. These Sonnets,
   (published collectively in 1880), have the charm of a singular
   humanity; of an originality which sometimes touches upon quaintness. No
   verse more sincere, more tender, more worthy of study, is contained in
   our Anthology.

   [408]321 CCCCXIV

   [409]scroll of prayer: 'The extract from the Book of the Dead, which
   was put into the hands of the deceased.'

   [410]322 CCCCXVI

   [411]Thou shalt not lose: so Petrarch, in one of those passages whose
   ethereal beauty reminds us of the Paradise scenes by Fra Angelico,
   speaking of the souls in Heaven;


     Tanti volti che 'l Tempo e Morte han guasti

     Torneranno al lor più florito stato.

   [412]325 CCCCXXIII

   [413]L. 10 oorali: a drug extracted from Strychnos toxifera; It acts by
   paralysing the nerves of motion, whilst those of sensation are left
   unimpaired.

   Readers should remember that this poem forms in truth a little drama,
   wherein it is not the Poet, but the Hospital Nurse, who speaks
   throughout. The two little girls, whose story was published in a
   magazine, are the only characters here drawn from actual life.

   This hymn, often printed as Anonymous, and so classed in former issues
   by the Editor, is by Sir Edward Denny, and was originally published in
   his Hymns and Poems, 1848 (W. T. Brooke).


   The writer was educated at Exeter, Oxford, and died whilst this book

   [540]As I in hoary Winter's night stood shivering in the snow 14

   [541]As I wer readen ov a stwone 265

   [542]As in the night I restless lie 150

   [543]As on my bed at dawn I mused and pray'd 321

   [544]At midnight, when yon azure fields on high 318

   [545]At noon a shower had fallen, and the clime 319

   [546]At the Lord's Table waiting, robed and stoled 319

   [547]At the round earth's imagined corners blow 19

   [548]Ave Maria! blessed Maid 223

   [549]Avore the time when zuns went down 266

   [550]Awake, my Soul, and with the sun 142

   [551]Awake, my soul, lift up thine eyes 193

   [552]Away, despair! my gracious Lord doth hear 44


   [553]Behold the sun, that seem'd but now 135

   [554]Behold we come, dear Lord, to Thee 134

   [555]Beneath a sable veil and shadows deep 25

   [556]Beneath our feet and o'er our head 198

   [557]Be not afraid to pray--to pray is right 240

   [558]Bethlehem, above all cities blest 263

   [559]Bless'd are the pure in heart 223

   [560]Blest be Thy love, dear Lord 130

   [561]Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heaven's joy 67

   [562]Bright Queen of Heaven? God's Virgin Spouse 99

   [563]Bright shadows of true Rest! some shoots of bliss 82

   [564]Brightest and best of the Sons of the morning 194

   [565]By cool Siloam's shady rill 196


   [566]Can I see another's woe 186

   [567]Children of the Heavenly King 179

   [568]Christ, Whose glory fills the skies 175

   [569]Close now thine eyes, and rest secure 123

   [570]Come, let us join our friends above 176

   [571]Come, O Thou Traveller unknown 172

   [572]Come, Thou long-expected Jesus 171

   [573]Come, we shepherds, whose blest sight 111

   [574]Compared with Christ, in all beside 171

   [575]Creator Spirit, by whose aid 138


   [576]Dear, beauteous Saint! more white than Day 100

   [577]Dear be the Church, that, watching o'er the needs 204

   [578]Dear Lord, 'tis finish'd! and now he 79

   [579]Death, thou wast once an uncouth hideous thing 50

   [580]Death was full urgent with thee, Sister dear 294

   [581]Doom'd as we are our native dust 203

   [582]Draw, Holy Ghost, Thy seven-fold veil 230

   [583]Draw near as early as we may 260


   [584]Each thing below here hath its day 75

   [585]Each trial has its weight; which, whoso bears 288

   [586]E'en like two little bank-dividing brooks 121

   [587]Eternal God! Maker of all 83

   [588]Eternal Mover, whose diffused glory 58


   [589]Fain would my thoughts fly up to Thee 131

   [590]Fair, solitary path! whose blessed shades 85

   [591]Fairest of all the lights above 155

   [592]Fairest of morning lights appear 69

   [593]Far, far on other isles 259

   [594]Far from the world, O Lord, I flee 184

   [595]Fly, envious Time, till thou run out thy race 67

   [596]For ever with the Lord 188

   [597]Fountain of Sweets! Eternal Dove 116

   [598]Frail Life! in which, through mists of human breath 68

   [599]Fresh fields and woods! the Earth's fair face 92

   [600]From pain to pain, from woe to woe 317


   [601]Give me a tender spotless child 252

   [602]Give me the lowest place: not that I dare 274

   [603]Give me the wings of faith to rise 158

   [604]Glory to God! and to the Power Who came 204

   [605]Glory to Thee, my God, this night 144

   [606]God of the living, in Whose eyes 311

   [607]God that madest Earth and Heaven 198

   [608]Go not far from me, O my strength 312

   [609]Great God Who knowest each man's need 323


   [610]Hail, scenes of holy grandeur! hail 243

   [611]Happy me! O happy sheep 112

   [612]Happy those early days, when I 80

   [613]Hark! how all the welkin rings 174

   [614]Hark how the birds do sing 40

   [615]Hark, my soul, how every thing 132

   [616]Hark, my soul! it is the Lord 182

   [617]Hark the glad sound! The Saviour comes 161

   [618]Hark, the sound of holy voices, chanting at the crystal sea 311

   [619]Hear me, O God 24

   [620]Hear what the voice from Heaven proclaims 157

   [621]Heaven in the depth and height is seen 255

   [622]Heavenly Messias, sweet anointed King 16

   [623]He is gone--beyond the skies 309

   [624]Here is the spring where waters flow 12

   [625]Her eyes are homes of silent prayer 324

   [626]He sang of God--the mighty source 164

   [627]Hierusalem, my happy home 17

   [628]Hither thou com'st: the busy wind all night 96

   [629]Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty 195

   [630]Holy is the sick man's room 260

   [631]How are Thy servants blest, O Lord 139

   [632]How beautiful it is to be alive 275

   [633]How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean 46

   [634]How long, great God, how long must I 120

   [635]How peacefully the broad and golden moon 322

   [636]How shall I sing that Majesty 135

   [637]How soon doth man decay 35

   [638]How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds 180

   [639]Hues of the rich unfolding morn 231

   [640]Hush! my dear, lie still and slumber 158


   [641]I cannot reach it; And my striving eye 81

   [642]I do not ask, O Lord, that life may be 270

   [643]I have a life with Christ to live 280

   [644]I heard the voice of Jesus say 308

   [645]I landed on Iona's holy isle 319

   [646]I mark'd a rainbow in the north 212

   [647]I mark'd when vernal meads were bright 253

   [648]I oft recal the moments dear 147

   [649]I praised the Earth, in beauty seen 196

   [650]I rise and raise my clasped hands to Thee 300

   [651]1 said sometimes with tears 128

   [652]I saw Eternity the other night 102

   [653]I saw thee once, and nought discern'd 284

   [654]1 saw this day a miser old 147

   [655]I say to thee, do thou repeat 234

   [656]I sing the birth was born to-night 23

   [657]I sought for Peace, but could not find 77

   [658]I thought to meet no more, so dreary seem'd 261

   [659]I travell'd on, seeing the hill, where lay 41

   [660]I walk'd the other day, (to spend my hour) 93

   [661]I worship Thee, sweet Will of God 316

   [662]I'd a dream to-night 269

   [663]I'm wearin' awa', John 241

   [664]Iesu is in my heart; His sacred name 51

   [665]If any have an ear 89

   [666]If I could shut the gate against my thoughts 28

   [667]If we could see below 43

   [668]If we with earnest effort could succeed 237

   [669]In childhood, when with eager eyes 283

   [670]In evil long I took delight 179

   [671]In some lone walk through sunburnt fields 302

   [672]In stature perfect, and with every gift 241

   [673]In the bleak mid-winter 272

   [674]In the hour of my distress 74

   [675]In this world, (the Isle of Dreams) 71

   [676]In token that thou shalt not fear 239

   [677]Infinite Power, Eternal Lord 155

   [678]It is a beauteous evening, calm and free 205


   [679]Jerusalem, that place divine 26

   [680]Jesus! I love Thy charming name 160

   [681]Jesu, Lover of my soul 177

   [682]Jesus! why dost Thou love me so 313

   [683]Justice doth call for vengeance on my sins 76


   [684]King of glory, King of peace 42


   [685]Lamb of God, I look to Thee 172

   [686]Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill 323

   [687]Latest born of Jesse's race 286

   [688]Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom 300

   [689]Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust 10

   [690]Let all the world in every corner sing 28

   [691]Let folly praise that fancy loves, I praise and love that Child 15

   [692]Let not the sluggish sleep 23

   [693]Let wits contest 48

   [694]Lift up your, heads, great Gates, and sing 116

   [695]Light of the lonely pilgrim's heart 307

   [696]Little lamb, who made thee 187

   [697]Lo, cast at random on the wild sea land 254

   [698]Lo, when back mine eye 20

   [699]Lord, come away 127

   [700]Lord, I have wrestled through the livelong night 304

   [701]Lord, in this dust Thy sovereign voice 282

   [702]Lord, in Thy Name Thy servants plead 258

   [703]Lord, it belongs not to my care 128

   [704]Lord! it is not life to live 171

   [705]Lord Jesus, loving hearts and dear 262

   [706]Lord, let the angels praise Thy name 36

   [707]Lord, make me coy and tender to offend 35

   [708]Lord of my heart, by Thy last cry 219

   [709]Lord of mercy and of might 195

   [710]Lord, Thou hast given me a cell 73

   [711]Lord, weary of a painful way 237

   [712]Lord, what unvalued pleasures crown'd 58

   [713]Lord, when I lift mine eyes to Thee 304

   [714]Lord, when the sense of Thy sweet grace 111

   [715]Lord, with what care hast Thou begirt us round 29

   [716]Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back 51

   [717]Love, lift me up upon thy golden wings 3


   [718]Man is permitted much 293

   [719]Mark you the floor? that square and speckled stone 30

   [720]Meeting with Time, 'Slack thing,' said I 38

   [721]Messiah! at Thy glad approach 167

   [722]Methinks I draw but sickly breath 27

   [723]More oft than once Death whisper'd in mine ear 24

   [724]Mother of God! O, not in vain 263

   [725]My glass is half unspent; Forbear t' arrest 123

   [726]My God and King! to Thee 87

   [727]My God, now I from sleep awake 145

   [728]My God, where is that ancient heat towards Thee 28

   [729]My joy, my Life, my Crown 29

   [730]My little son, who look'd from thoughtful eyes 278

   [731]My Lord, my Love, was crucified 134

   [732]My soul doth pant towards Thee 126

   [733]My soul, there is a country 90

   [734]My spirit longeth for Thee 161

   [735]My sun has set, I dwell 273


   [736]Never weather-beaten sail more willing bent to shore 22

   [737]Never yet could careless Sleep 114

   [738]No; 'tis in vain to seek for bliss 153

   [739]Not seldom, clad in radiant vest 205

   [740]Now gladdeth every living creature 1

   [741]Nurse, let me draw the baby's veil aside 257


   [742]O aged Saint? far off I heard 284

   [743]O book! Life's guide! how shall we part 84

   [744]O comrade bold, of toil and pain 291

   [745]O Day most calm, most bright 31

   [746]O day of life, of light, of love 110

   [747]O fool, of short-lived goods possest 146

   [748]O God! I know and do confess 87

   [749]O God, impart Thy blessing to my cries 320

   [750]O God, our help in ages past 157

   [751]O Gracious God, O Saviour sweet 15

   [752]O holiest Truth! how have I lied to Thee 300

   [753]O holy, holy, holy Lord 153

   [754]O Holy Lord, who with the Children Three 292

   [755]O let me climb 81

   [756]O Lord, how wonderful in depth and height 294

   [757]O Lord, my best desire fulfil 183

   [758]O Lord my God, do Thou Thy holy will 217

   [759]O man, forgive thy mortal foe 325

   [760]O Mighty God, Which for us men 11

   [761]O only Source of all our light and life 279

   [762]O sing the glories of our Lord 70

   [763]O thou unknown, Almighty Cause 185

   [764]O Thy bright looks! Thy glance of love 83

   [765]O Years! and Age! Farewell 72

   [766]Oft have I read of sunny realms, where skies are pure at even 249

   [767]Oh blessing, wearing semblance of a curse 236

   [768]Oh come and mourn with me awhile 317

   [769]Oh God that madest earth and sky, the darkness and the day 198

   [770]Oh help us, Lord! each hour of need 199

   [771]Oh I could go through all life's troubles singing 314

   [772]Oh! say not, dream not, heavenly notes 229

   [773]Oh thou of dark forebodings drear 235

   [774]Oh weep not o'er thy children's tomb 194

   [775]Our doctor had call'd in another, I never had seen him before 325


   [776]Pleasant are Thy courts above 248

   [777]Poor Soul, the centre of my sinful earth 11

   [778]Praise to God, immortal praise 192

   [779]Praise to the Holiest in the height 298, 299

   [780]Prayer is the soul's sincere desire 189

   [781]Prune thou thy words, the thoughts control 290


   [782]Quiet, Lord, my froward heart 181


   [783]Red o'er the forest peers the setting sun 213

   [784]Rejoice in God alway 256

   [785]Rise, O my soul! with thy desires to heaven 59

   [786]Rock of Ages, cleft for me 170


   [787]Saviour, when in dust to Thee 191

   [788]Say, hast thou track'd a traveller's round 289

   [789]Say, who is he in deserts seen 285

   [790]Seek the Lord, and in His ways persever 22

   [791]She is not dead--she only sleeps 244

   [792]She sat and wept beside His feet; the weight 240

   [793]Shepherds, rejoice, lift up your eyes 154

   [794]Show me more love, my dearest Lord 57

   [795]Sighs--whether swift to Heaven they rise 149

   [796]Sin is with man at morning-break 215

   [797]Since I in storms used most to be 88

   [798]Sing aloud, His praise rehearse 119

   [799]Sometimes a light surprises 183

   [800]Soul, which to hell wast thrall 26

   [801]Strange to our ears the church-bells of our home 218

   [802]Sure thou didst flourish once! and many springs 95

   [803]Sweet baby, sleep! what ails my dear 125

   [804]Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright 34

   [805]Sweet dreams, form a shade 186

   [806]Sweet, harmless lives!--upon whose holy leisure 97

   [807]Sweet Music, sweeter far 13

   [808]Sweet Peace, where dost thou dwell,--I humbly crave 39

   [809]Sweet place, sweet place alone 129


   [810]Take me away, and in the lowest deep 298

   [811]Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense 204

   [812]Teach me, my God and King 49

   [813]That was the Shepherd of the flock; He knew 313

   [814]The church do zeem a touchen zight 264

   [815]The Church shone brightly in her youthful days 287

   [816]The door of death is made of gold 188

   [817]The flash of youthful light is past and gone 306

   [818]The fleet astronomer can bore 40

   [819]The God of Abraham praise 168

   [820]The golden gates are lifted up 310

   [821]The Holy Book, like the Eighth Sphere, does shine 138

   [822]The last and greatest Herald of heaven's King 26

   [823]The Lord hath builded for Himself 244

   [824]The Lord will happiness divine 182

   [825]The lucky World shew'd me one day 101

   [826]The merry World did on a day 37

   [827]The mid-day sun, with fiercest glare 226

   [828]The night is come, and all the world is still 303

   [829]The number of Thine own complete 296

   [830]The Past can be no more 149

   [831]The pleasant years that seem, so swift that run 3

   [832]The Son of God in doing good 219

   [833]The song of God, so nobly sung 245

   [834]The sound of war! In earth and air 197

   [835]The spacious firmament on high 141

   [836]The world has cycles in its course, when all 287

   [837]There is a book, who runs may read 206

   [838]There is a Stream, which issues forth 135

   [839]These sweeter far than lilies are 137

   [840]They are all gone into the world of light 107

   [841]This Advent moon shines cold and clear 270

   [842]This did not once so trouble me 236

   [843]This is the month, and this the happy morn 60

   [844]This is the Saint of gentleness and kindness 285

   [845]Tho' death met love upon thy dying smile 322

   [846]Thou art not Truth! for he that tries 104

   [847]Thou bidst me come away 71

   [848]Thou cam'st from Heaven to Earth, that we 99

   [849]Thou hast made me, and shall Thy work decay 19

   [850]Thou inevitable Day 238

   [851]Thou that know'st for whom I mourn 106

   [852]Thou Whose nature cannot sleep 69

   [853]Through Contemplation's optics I have seen 121

   [854]Through that pure virgin shrine 97

   [855]Throw away Thy rod 49

   [856]Thy servants pray, O hear us, Lord 323

   [857]Thy way, not mine, O Lord 307

   [858]Time was, I shrank from what was right 292

   [859]Time! where didst thou those years inter 55

   [860]Times without number have I pray'd 176

   [861]'Tis gone, that bright and orbed blaze 233

   [862]'Tis only our dull hearts that tire so soon 255

   [863]'Tis true, of old th' unchanging sun 210

   [864]To God, ye choir above, begin 184

   [865]To keep the lamp alive 189

   [866]To leave unseen so many a glorious sight 238

   [867]To music bent is my retired mind 22

   [868]To Thy temple I repair 189

   [869]Triumphant conqueror of death and hell 17

   [870]'Twas so; I saw thy birth:--That drowsy lake 96

   [871]'Twixt gleams of joy and clouds of doubt 281

   [872]Two brothers freely cast their lot 287


   [873]Unfold! unfold! Take in His light 88

   [874]Unveil, O Lord, and on us shine 290


   [875]View me, Lord, a work of Thine 21


   [876]Wake, all my hopes, lift up your eyes 132

   [877]We look around, the murky sky is still 301

   [878]We scatter seeds with careless hand 252

   [879]We were not by when Jesus came 225

   [880]Weep not for me 295

   [881]Weighing the steadfastness and state 104

   [882]Welcome, thou safe retreat 53

   [883]What am I who dare call Thee, God 52

   [884]What God gives, and what we take 72

   [885]What is House and what is Home 115

   [886]What is it that amid some earthly home 305

   [887]What is the saddest sweetest lowest sound 310

   [888]What, many times I musing ask'd, is Man 235

   [889]What's this Morn's bright eye to me 113

   [890]What wealth to earth our God hath given 276

   [891]What went ye out to see 209

   [892]When all Thy mercies, O my God 140

   [893]When first God stirr'd me, and the Church's word 290

   [894]When first Thou didst entice to Thee my heart 32

   [895]When first thy eyes unveil, give thy soul leave 82

   [896]When first Thy sweet and gracious eye 47

   [897]When for the thorns with which I long, too long 78

   [898]When gathering clouds around I view 190

   [899]When God at first made Man 45

   [900]When I consider how my light is spent 68

   [901]When I look back, and in myself behold 2

   [902]When I look back upon my former race 289

   [903]When I survey the bright 56

   [904]When Israel's ruler on the royal bed 162

   [905]When Jesus, by the Virgin brought 166

   [906]When Lazarus left his charnel-cave 324

   [907]When my devotions could not pierce 33

   [908]When Nature tries her finest touch 216

   [909]When our heads are bow'd with woe 200

   [910]When the four quarters of the world shall rise 321

   [911]When thy lone dreams sweet visions see 274

   [912]When travail hours are spent and o'er 251

   [913]When weakness now do strive wi' might 268

   [914]When with these eyes, closed now by Thee 109

   [915]Whene'er goes forth Thy dread command 297

   [916]Where is it mothers learn their love 228

   [917]Where is Thy favour'd haunt, eternal Voice 207

   [918]Where the remote Bermudas ride 77

   [919]Where will they stop, those breathing Powers 201

   [920]Where'er my flattering passions rove 156

   [921]Where's now the object of thy fears 117

   [922]Wherefore shrink, and say, 'Tis vain' 259

   [923]While shepherds watch'd their flocks by night 152

   [924]While that my soul repairs to her devotion 30

   [925]While they here sojourn'd, their presence drew us 280

   [926]Whither, O whither didst thou fly 80

   [927]Wish not, dear friends, my pain away 221

   [928]Wilt Thou forgive that sin where I begun 20

   [929]With sick and famish'd eyes 43

   [930]With what deep murmurs, through Time's silent stealth 92

   [931]Who seeketh finds: what shall be his relief 279

   [932]Who to the golden Sun's long restless race 17

   [933]Why do I sigh to find 246

   [934]Why dost thou beat so quick, my heart 315

   [935]Why should we faint and fear to live alone 222

   [936]Why they have never known the way before 301

   [937]Why, wedded to the Lord, still yearns my heart 288


   [938]Ye flaming Powers, and winged warriors bright 66

   [939]Ye golden lamps of Heaven, farewell 159

   [940]Ye hermits blest, ye holy maids 208

   [941]Ye humble souls, that seek the Lord 160

   [942]Yes, mark the words, deem not that Saints alone 282

   [943]You holy Virgins, that so oft surround 122

   [944]You Spirits! who have thrown away 54
