PREFACE.

   Among the Hymns in the following collection will be found many which
   are not of the commonly recognized metres. Some of these are already
   set to music of their own. Others can readily be adapted by the
   choir-leader to the simple chants which are now generally found in our
   collections of Sacred Music.

   An asterisk prefixed to the author's name indicates that some change
   has been made in the hymn by the present compilers.

   The titles of the Supplementary Hymns in the present edition have been
   introduced within the original table of contents, instead of forming a
   separate series at the end.

   Boston, April 22, 1848.

   [495]The bud will soon become a flower, 300
   [496]The darkened sky, how thick it lowers, 328
   [497]The daylight is fading o'er earth and o'er ocean, 552
   [498]The dead are like the stars by day, 353
   [499]The dove, let loose in Eastern skies, 273
   [500]The earth all light and loveliness, 395
   [501]The fountain in its source, 240
   [502]The glorious universe around, 585
   [503]The heavenly spheres to Thee, O God, 399
   [504]The kings of old have shrine and tomb, 427
   [505]The land our fathers left to us, 436
   [506]The light pours down from heaven, 458
   [507]The Lord descended from above, 472
   [508]The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know, 247
   [509]The Lord our God is full of might, 573
   [510]The mourners came, at break of day, 347
   [511]The ocean looketh up to heaven, 85
   [512]The offerings to Thy throne which rise, 19
   [513]The past is dark with sin and shame, 187
   [514]The peace which God bestows, 164
   [515]There cometh o'er the spirit, 392
   [516]There is a book, who runs may read, 476
   [517]There is a state unknown, unseen, 357
   [518]There is a world we have not seen, 450
   [519]There's a strife we all must wage, 319
   [520]There's nothing bright above, below, 83
   [521]The saints on earth and those above, 453
   [522]The Spirit in our hearts, 194
   [523]The spirits of the loved and the departed, 354
   [524]The uplifted eye and bended knee, 305
   [525]The winds are hushed; the peaceful moon, 474
   [526]The world may change from old to new, 274
   [527]They who on the Lord rely, 248
   [528]They who seek the throne of grace, 82
   [529]Think gently of the erring one, 284
   [530]Thirsting for a living spring, 5
   [531]This child we dedicate to Thee, 377
   [532]This world is not a fleeting show, 296
   [533]Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee, 409
   [534]Thou art, O God, the life and light, 84
   [535]Though lonely be thy path, fear not, for He, 336
   [536]Though wandering in a strange land, 88
   [537]Thou givest Thy Sabbath, Lord! the din is stilled, 485
   [538]Thou hidden love of God, whose height, 219
   [539]Thou, infinite in love, 333
   [540]Thou Lord of hosts, whose guiding hand, 425
   [541]Thou, Lord, who rear'st the mountain's height, 303
   [542]Thou most be born again, 200
   [543]Thou seest my feebleness, 516
   [544]Thou that art strong to comfort, look on me, 330
   [545]Thou, whose almighty word, 174
   [546]Through all the various shifting scene, 261
   [547]Through all this life's eventful road, 66
   [548]Throughout the hours of darkness dim, 559
   [549]Through thee as we together came, 163
   [550]Thus said Jesus, "Go and do, 292
   [551]Thy bounteous hand with food can bless, 492
   [552]"Thy kingdom come," the heathen lands, 171
   [553]Thy presence, ever-living God, 67
   [554]Thy servants in the temple watched, 589
   [555]Thy servant's sandals, Lord, are wet, 386
   [556]Thy way is on the deep, O Lord, 332
   [557]Thy will be done! in devious way, 265
   [558]Thy will be done! I will not fear, 276
   [559]'Tis my happiness below, 271
   [560]'Tis not the gift, but 'tis the spirit, 289
   [561]"To God be glory! peace on earth!" 422
   [562]To Him who children blest, 379
   [563]To prayer, to prayer!--for the morning breaks, 2
   [564]To Thee, O God in heaven, 378
   [565]To Thee, the Lord Almighty, 494
   [566]To the Father's love we trust, 412
   [567]To Thine eternal arms, O God, 205
   [568]Triumphant Zion! lift thy head, 178
   [569]Turn, child of doubt, estranged from God, 196
   [570]Turn not from him who asks of thee, 286
   [571]Unchangeable, all-perfect Lord, 71
   [572]Unto Thy temple, God of love, 10
   [573]Up to the throne of God is borne, 369
   [574]Wait on the Lord, ye heirs of hope, 529
   [575]Was it in vain that Jesus prayed, 183
   [576]Watchman, tell us of the night, 102
   [577]We all, O Father, all are Thine, 251
   [578]We bless Thee for this sacred day, 484
   [579]Weep thou, O mourner, but in lamentation, 340
   [580]We follow, Lord, where Thou dost lead, 563
   [581]We join to pray, with wishes kind, 380
   [582]We love the venerable house, 423
   [583]We love this outward world, 339
   [584]We pray for truth and peace, 525
   [585]Westward, Lord, the world alluring, 418
   [586]We wait in faith; in prayer we wait, 595
   [587]We will not weep; for God is standing by us, 533
   [588]We would leave, O God, to Thee, 324
   [589]What precept, Jesus, is like thine, 442
   [590]What shall we ask of God in prayer, 32
   [591]When arise the thoughts of sin, 148
   [592]When, blest Redeemer, thou art near, 154
   [593]When from the Jordan's gleaming wave, 376
   [594]When grief and anguish press me down, 262
   [595]When in silence o'er the deep, 568
   [596]When in thine hour of conflict, Lord, 215
   [597]When Israel of the Lord beloved, 36
   [598]When long the soul had slept in chains, 574
   [599]When on devotion's seraph wing, 359
   [600]When my love to Christ grows weak, 144
   [601]When the parting bosom bleeds, 571
   [602]When thirst for power or for gold, 457
   [603]When with error bewildered, our path becomes dreary, 212
   [604]Where ancient forests widely spread, 382
   [605]Where for a thousand miles, 417
   [606]Where is thy sting, O death, 349
   [607]While shepherds watched their flocks by night, 105
   [608]While sounds of war are heard around, 580
   [609]While Thee I seek, protecting Power, 95
   [610]While the stars unnumbered roll, 555
   [611]While yet the youthful spirit bears, 447
   [612]Who is thy neighbor? he whom thou, 293
   [613]Who shall behold the glorious day, 175
   [614]Why, Thou never-setting Light, 210
   [615]Wilt Thou not visit me, 237
   [616]Within Thy courts have millions met, 375
   [617]With silence only as their benediction, 342
   [618]Wouldst thou in thy lonely hour, 92
   [619]Yea! I will extol Thee, 549
   [620]Ye joyous ones! upon whose brow, 446
   [621]Ye servants of the Lord, 277
   [622]Yes! prayer is strong, and God is good, 206

Invitation.


   Come to the house of prayer,

   O ye afflicted, come!

   The God of peace shall meet you there,

   He makes that house His home.


   Come to the house of praise,

   Ye who are happy now;

   In sweet accord your voices raise,

   In kindred homage bow.


   Ye aged, hither come,

   For ye have felt His love;

   Soon shall ye lift a holier song

   In fairer courts above.


   Ye young, before His throne,

   Come, bow; your voices raise;

   Let not your hearts His praise disown,

   Who gives the power to praise.


   Thou, whose benignant eye

   In mercy looks on all;

   Who seest the tear of misery,

   And hear'st the mourner's call;


   Up to Thy dwelling-place

   Bear our frail spirits on,

   Till they outstrip time's tardy pace,

   And heaven on earth be won.

Call to Prayer.


   To prayer, to prayer!--for the morning breaks,

   And earth in her Maker's smile awakes;

   His light is on all below and above,

   The light of gladness, and life, and love:

   O, then, on the breath of this early air,

   Send upward the incense of grateful prayer.


   To prayer!--for the day that God has blest

   Comes tranquilly on with its solemn rest;

   It speaks of creation's early bloom,--

   It speaks of the Prince who burst the tomb:

   Then summon the spirit's exalted powers,

   And devote to heaven the hallowed hours.


   Awake, awake, and gird up thy strength,

   To join Christ's holy band at length;

   To Him who unceasing love displays,

   Whom the powers of nature unceasingly praise;

   To Him thy heart and thy hours be given,

   For a life of prayer is the life of heaven.

   Come, ye who love the Lord!

   And let your joys be known;

   Join in a song with sweet accord,

   And thus surround His throne.


   The sorrows of the mind

   Be banished from this place!

   Religion never was designed

   To make our pleasures less.


   The sons of God have found

   That heaven begins below:

   Celestial fruits, on earthly ground,

   From faith and hope may grow.


   Then let our sorrows cease,

   And every tear be dry;

   We're travelling through the paths of peace

   To fairer worlds on high.

The House of God.


   Be still! be still! for all around,

   On either hand, is holy ground:

   Here in His house, the Lord to-day

   Will listen, while His people pray.


   Thou, tost upon the waves of care,

   Ready to sink with deep despair,

   Here ask relief, with heart sincere,

   And thou shalt find that God is here.


   Thou who hast laid within the grave

   Those whom thou hadst no power to save,

   Believe their spirits now are near,

   For angels wait while God is here.


   Thou who hast dear ones far away,

   In foreign lands, 'mid ocean's spray,

   Pray for them now, and dry the tear,

   And trust the God who listens here.


   Thou who art mourning o'er thy sin,

   Deploring guilt that reigns within,

   The God of peace is ever near;

   The troubled spirit meets Him here.

   Seeking for a higher home,

   Resting where our souls must cling,

   Trusting, hoping, Lord, we come.


   Glorious hopes our spirit fill,

   When we feel that Thou art near:

   Father! then our fears are still,

   Then the soul's bright end is clear.


   Life's hard conflict we would win,

   Read the meaning of life's frown;

   Change the thorn-bound wreath of sin

   For the spirit's starry crown.


   Make us beautiful within

   By Thy spirit's holy light:

   Guard us when our faith burns dim,

   Father of all love and might!

   Forth from the dark and stormy sky,

   Lord, to Thine altar's shade we fly;

   Forth from the world, its hope and fear,

   Father, we seek Thy shelter here:

   Weary and weak, Thy grace we pray;

   Turn not, O Lord! Thy guests away.


   Long have we roamed in want and pain,

   Long have we sought Thy rest in vain;

   Wildered in doubt, in darkness lost,

   Long have our souls been tempest-tost:

   Low at Thy feet our sins we lay;

   Turn not, O Lord! Thy guests away.

The Sabbath of the Soul.


   O Father, though the anxious fear

   May cloud to-morrow's way,

   No fear nor doubt shall enter here;

   All shall be Thine to-day.


   We will not bring divided hearts

   To worship at Thy shrine;

   But each unworthy thought departs,

   And leaves this temple Thine.


   Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,

   Of earth and folly born;

   Ye shall not dim the light that streams

   From this celestial morn.


   To-morrow will be time enough

   To feel your harsh control;

   Ye shall not violate this day,

   The sabbath of the soul.

   Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,

   Pure, unbounded love Thou art;

   Visit us with Thy salvation,

   Into every troubled breast;

   Let us all in Thee inherit,

   Far from mortal cares retreating,

   Sordid hopes, and fond desires,

   Here our willing footsteps meeting,

   Every heart to heaven aspires.

   From the Fount of glory beaming,

   Light celestial cheers our eyes;

   Mercy from above proclaiming

   Peace and pardon from the skies.


   Who may share this great salvation?--

   Every pure and humble mind;

   Every kindred, tongue, and nation,

   From the dross of guilt refined:

   Blessings all around bestowing,

   God withholds His care from none;

   Grace and mercy ever flowing

   From the fountain of His throne.


   Every stain of guilt abhorring,

   Firm and bold in virtue's cause,

   Still Thy providence adoring,

   Faithful subjects to Thy laws,

   Lord! with favor still attend us,

   Bless us with Thy wondrous love;

   May all Thy purest presence feel,

   And silent keep each vain desire;

   With humble hearts before Thee kneel,

   And unto holier strength aspire.


   May all be bound in bonds more true

   To Thee, who art our life and light,

   That through each path which we pursue,

   We still may keep Thy love in sight.


   And may we, when the day shall close,

   Review its course without a fear;

   Heal the wounded, feed the poor;

   Leave to the Lord your heavy care,

   Come with a trusting prayer,

   Though fears press down your souls;

   The Saviour's promise, "I am there,"

   Each saddening fear controls.


   Here, in this place of prayer,

   Let hearts in union meet:

   Come, cast the load you cannot bear

   Let the soul expand her stores,

   Gave life to clay, and formed us men;

   And when like wandering sheep we strayed,

   He brought us to His fold again.


   We are His people, we His care,

   Our souls and all our mortal frame:

   What lasting honors shall we rear,

   Almighty Maker, to Thy name?


   We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs;

   High as the heavens our voices raise;

   And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,

   Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.

"After This Manner Pray Ye."


   Our Heavenly Father, hear

   The prayer we offer now:

   Thy name be hallowed far and near,

   To Thee all nations bow.


   Thy kingdom come; Thy will

   On earth be done in love,

   As saints and seraphim fulfil

   Thy perfect law above.


   Our daily bread supply,

   While by Thy word we live;

   The guilt of our iniquity

   Forgive as we forgive.


   From dark temptation's power

   Our feeble hearts defend;

   Deliver in the evil hour,

   And guide us to the end.


   Thine, then, forever be

   Glory and power divine;

   The sceptre, throne, and majesty

   Of heaven and earth are Thine.

   Let every understanding mind

   Unite to praise Thy love.


   Thy kingdom come, with power and grace,

   To every heart of man;

   Thy peace, and joy, and righteousness,

   In all our bosoms reign.


   The righteousness that never ends,

   But makes an end of sin;

   The joy that human thought transcends,

   Now to our souls bring in:


   The kingdom of established peace,

   Which can no more remove;

   The perfect powers of godliness,

   The omnipotence of Love.

   Lord, our times are in Thy hand;

   All our sanguine hopes have planned

   To Thy wisdom we resign,

   And would mould our wills to Thine.


   Thou our daily task shalt give;

   Day by day to Thee we live;

   So shall added years fulfil

   Not our own, our Father's will.

   Give what Thine eye delights to see,

   Truth in the inward parts:


   Give deep humility; the sense

   Of holy sorrow give:

   A strong, desiring confidence,

   To hear Thy voice and live:


   Patience, to watch, and wait, and weep,

   Though mercy long delay;

   Courage, our fainting souls to keep,

   And trust Thee, though Thou slay.


   Give these,--and then Thy will be done!

   O, give the weary soul repose,

   The wounded spirit heal!


   When dire temptations gather round,

   And threaten or allure,

   Father, in Thy mysterious presence kneeling,

   Fain would our souls feel all Thy kindling love;

   For we are weak, and need some deep revealing

   Of Trust and Strength and Calmness from above.


   Lord, we have wandered forth through doubt and sorrow,

   And Thou hast made each step an onward one;

   And we will ever trust each unknown morrow,--

   Thou wilt sustain us till its work is done.


   In the heart's depths a peace serene and holy

   Abides, and when pain seems to have her will,

   Or we despair,--O, may that peace rise slowly,

   Stronger than agony, and we be still!


   Now, Father, now, in Thy dear presence kneeling,

   Our spirits yearn to feel Thy kindling love;

   Now make us strong, we need Thy deep revealing

   Of Trust and Strength and Calmness from above.

   Out from the land of bondage came,

   Her fathers' God before her moved,

   An awful guide in smoke and flame.


   By day, along the astonished lands

   The cloudy pillar glided slow;

   By night, Arabia's crimsoned sands

   Returned the fiery column's glow.


   Thus present still, though now unseen,

   When brightly shines the prosperous day,

   Be thoughts of Thee a cloudy screen,

   To temper the deceitful ray!

   In shade and storm the frequent night,

   Heaven and earth must pass away,

   Songs of praise shall crown that day;

   God will make new heavens and earth,

   Songs of praise shall hail their birth.


   And shall man alone be dumb,

   Till that glorious kingdom come?

   No; his heart delights to raise

Go in Peace.


   Go in peace!--serene dismission

   To the loving heart made known,

   When it pours in deep contrition

   Prayer before the eternal throne.


   Go in peace! thy sins forgiven,

   Christ hath healed thee, set thee free

   Every spirit-fetter riven,

   Go in peace, and liberty!


   Saviour! breathe this benediction

   O'er our spirits while we pray;

   Let us part in sweet conviction

   Thou hast blessed our souls to-day.

The Seed of the Word.


   O God, by whom the seed is given,

   By whom the harvest blest;

   Whose word, like manna showered from heaven,

   Is planted in our breast;


   Preserve it from the passing feet,

   And plunderers of the air;

   The sultry sun's intenser heat,

   And weeds of worldly care!


   Though buried deep, or thinly strewn,

   Do Thou Thy grace supply;

   The hope, in earthly furrows sown,

   Shall ripen in the sky.

   Fain would I walk with Thee, my God,

   And make Thy presence light around,

   And every step on holy ground.


   Each blessing would I trace to Thee,

   In every grief Thy mercy see;

   And through the paths of duty move,

   Conscious of Thine encircling love.


   And when the angel Death stands by,

   Be this my strength, that Thou art nigh;

   And this my joy, that I shall be

   With those who dwell in light with Thee.

Christian Farewell.


   Thy presence, ever living God!

   Wide through all nature spreads abroad;

   Thy watchful eyes, which never sleep,

   In every place Thy children keep.


   While near each other we remain,

   Thou dost our lives and powers sustain;

   When separate, we rejoice to share

   Thy counsels, and Thy gracious care.


   To Thee we now commit our ways,

   And still implore Thy heavenly grace;

   Still cause Thy face on us to shine,

   And guard and guide us still as Thine.


   Give us within Thy house to raise

   Again united songs of praise;

   Or, if that joy no more be known,

   Give us to meet around Thy throne.

   Whate'er in earth, or sea, or sky,

   Or shuns, or meets, the wandering thought,

   High is Thy power above all height,

   Whate'er Thy will decrees is done;

   Thy wisdom, holiness and might

   Can by no finite mind be known.

   What our dim eyes could never see,

   Is plain and naked in Thy sight;

   What thickest darkness veils, to Thee

   Shines clearly as the morning light;


   Thine, Lord, is holiness, alone:

   Justice and Truth before Thee stand:

   Yet, nearer to Thy sacred throne,

   Love ever dwells at Thy right hand.

   And to Thy love and ceaseless care,

   To seek Thy present aid may dare.


   And though most weak our efforts seem

   Into one creed these thoughts to bind,

   And vain the intellectual dream,

   To see and know the Eternal Mind,--


   Yet Thou wilt turn them not aside,

   Who cannot solve Thy life divine,

   But would give up all reason's pride

   To know their hearts approved by Thine.


   And Thine unceasing love gave birth

   To our dear Lord, Thy holy Son,

   Who left a perfect proof on earth,

   That Duty, Love, and Truth are one.


   So, though we faint on life's dark hill,

   And Thought grow weak, and Knowledge flee,

   Yet Faith shall teach us courage still,

   And Love shall guide us on to Thee!

The Earth Full of God


   God, in the high and holy place,

   Looks down upon the spheres;

   Yet in His providence and grace

   To every eye appears.


   He bows the heavens; the mountains stand,

   A highway for our God:

   He walks amidst the desert-land;

   'Tis Eden where He trod.


   The forests in His strength rejoice;

   Hark! on the evening breeze,

   As once of old, the Lord God's voice

   Is heard among the trees.


   In every stream His bounty flows,

   Diffusing joy and wealth;

   In every breeze His Spirit blows,--

   The breath of life and health.


   His blessings fall in plenteous showers

   Upon the lap of earth,

   That teems with foliage, fruits, and flowers,

   And rings with infant mirth.


   If God hath made this world so fair,

   Where sin and death abound,

   How beautiful beyond compare

   Will Paradise be found!

   Is born beneath Thy kindling eye:

   As bends the human knee;

   A beautiful and tireless band,

   The priesthood of the sea.


   The mists are lifted from the rills,

   Like the white wing of prayer;

   They kneel above the ancient hills,

   As doing homage there.


   The forest-tops are lowly cast

   O'er breezy hill and glen,

   As if a prayerful spirit passed

   On nature as on men.

   Is glorious with the spirit march

   Or when, in paler tints arrayed,

   The evening slowly spreads her shade,

   That soothing shade, that grateful gloom,

   Can, more than day's enlivening bloom,

   Still every fond and vain desire,

   And calmer, purer thoughts inspire;

   From earth the longing spirit free,

   And lead the softened heart to Thee.

   Pure, warm, silent, to Thee.


   As still to the star of its worship, though clouded,

   The needle points faithfully o'er the dim sea,

   So, dark when I roam, in this wintry world shrouded,

   The hope of my spirit turns, trembling, to Thee,

   My God! trembling, to Thee,--

   True, sure, trembling, to Thee.

Pray Without Ceasing.


   Go when the morning shineth,

   Go when the noon is bright,

   Go when the eve declineth,

   Go in the hush of night;

   Go with pure mind and feeling,

   Put earthly thoughts away,

   And, in God's presence kneeling,

   Do thou in secret pray.


   Remember all who love thee,

   All who are loved by thee;

   Pray, too, for those who hate thee,

   If any such there be;

   Then for thyself, in meekness,

   A blessing humbly claim,

   And blend with each petition

   Thy great Redeemer's name.


   Or, if 'tis e'er denied thee

   In solitude to pray,

   Should holy thoughts come o'er thee

   When friends are round thy way,

   E'en then, the silent breathing

   Thy spirit lifts above

   Will reach His throne of glory,

   Where dwells eternal love.


   O, not a joy or blessing

   With this can we compare,--

   The grace our Father gives us

   To pour our souls in prayer:

   Whene'er thou pin'st in sadness,

   On Him who saveth, call!

   Remember, in thy gladness,

   His love who gave thee all.

   Child, amidst the flowers at play,

   While the red light fades away;

   Mother, with thine earnest eye,

   Ever following silently;


   Father, by the breeze of eve

   Called thy daily toil to leave;

   Pray! ere yet the dark hours be,

   Lift the heart, and bend the knee!


   Traveller in the stranger's land,

   Far from thine own household band;

   Mourner, haunted by the tone

   Of a voice from this world gone;


   Captive, in whose narrow cell

   Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;

   Sailor, on the darkening sea,

   Lift the heart, and bend the knee!


   Ye that triumph, ye that sigh,

   Kindred by one holy tie,

   Heaven's first star alike ye see;

   Lift the heart, and bend the knee!

What is Prayer?


   Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,

   Unuttered or expressed,

   The motion of a hidden fire,

   That trembles in the breast.


   Prayer is the burden of a sigh,

   The falling of a tear,

   The upward glancing of an eye,

   When none but God is near.


   Prayer is the simplest form of speech

   That infant lips can try;

   Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach

   The Majesty on high.


   Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,

   The Christian's native air,

   His watchword at the gates of death;

   He enters heaven with prayer.


   Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice

   Returning from his ways;

   While angels in their songs rejoice,

   And cry, "Behold, he prays!"


   In prayer, on earth, the saints are one;

   They're one in word and mind;

   When with the Father and the Son

   Sweet fellowship they find.


   O Thou by whom we come to God,

   The Life, the Truth, the Way,

   The path of prayer thyself hast trod;

   Lord, teach us how to pray!

Prayer the Life of the Soul.


   Prayer is to God the soul's sure way;

   So flows the grace he waits to give;

   Long as they live should Christians pray;

   They learn to pray when first they live.


   If pain afflict, or wrongs oppress,

   If cares distract, or fears dismay,

   If guilt deject, if sin distress,

   In every need, still watch and pray.


   'Tis prayer supports the soul that's weak,

   Though poor and broken be its word;

   Pray if thou canst, or canst not, speak;

   The breathings of the soul are heard.


   Depend on Him; thou shalt prevail;

   Make all thy wants and wishes known;

   Fear not, His mercy will not fail;

   Ask but in faith, it shall be done.

Silent Prayer.


   Sweet is the prayer whose holy stream

   In earnest pleading flows;

   Devotion dwells upon the theme,

   And warm and warmer glows.


   Faith grasps the blessing she desires,

   Hope points the upward gaze;

   And love, untrembling love, inspires

   The eloquence of praise.


   But sweeter far the still, small voice,

   Heard by no human ear,

   When God hath made the heart rejoice,

   And dried the bitter tear.


   Nor accents flow, nor words ascend;

   All utterance faileth there;

   But listening spirits comprehend,

   And God accepts the prayer.

   Aught of hope or joy foretell?

   Traveller! yes; it brings the day,

   Promised day of Israel!

   Watchman! will its beams alone

   Gild the spot that gave them birth?

   Traveller! ages are its own;

   See, it bursts o'er all the earth.


   Watchman! tell us of the night,

   For the morning seems to dawn;

   Traveller! darkness takes its flight;

   A Voice from the desert comes awful and shrill;

   The Lord is advancing; prepare ye the way!

   The word of Jehovah he comes to fulfil,

   And o'er the dark world pour the splendor of day.


   Bring down the proud mountain, though towering to heaven,

   And be the low valley exalted on high;

   The rough path and crooked be made smooth and even,

   For, Zion! your King, your Redeemer, is nigh.


   The beams of salvation his progress illume,

   The lone, dreary wilderness sings of her God;

The Dayspring From on High.


   Darkness o'er the world was brooding

   Sadder than Egyptian gloom;

   Souls by myriads lay in slumber

   Deep as of the sealed tomb.


   Earth had lost the links which bound it

   To the throne of light above;

   Yet an eye was watching o'er it,

   And that eye was full of love.


   Like a glorious beam of morning,

   Straight a ray pierced through the cloud,

   Spirits mightily awakening

   From their dark and heavy shroud.


   Still that ray shines on and brightens,

   Chasing mist and gloom away;

   Happy they on whom it gathers

   With its full and perfect day!

   And glory shone around.


   "Fear not," said he,--for mighty dread

   Had seized their troubled mind,--

   "Glad tidings of great joy I bring

   To you and all mankind.


   "To you, in David's town, this day

   Is born, of David's line,

   The Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;

   And this shall be the sign:


   "The heavenly babe you there shall find

   To human view displayed,

   All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,

   And in a manger laid."


   Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith

   Appeared a shining throng

   Of angels, praising God, who thus

   Address their joyful song:


   "All glory be to God on high,

   And to the earth be peace!

   Good-will henceforth, from heaven to men,

   Make music on the air.

   Send back the glad reply;

   That hour, heaven's glory shed

   Around the palms, and o'er the streams,

   Be near, through life and death,

   As in that holiest night

   Of hope, and joy, and faith;

   O Star which led to Him whose love

   Brought down man's ransom free!

   Where art thou?--'midst the host above

   May we still gaze on thee?

Tempted As We Are.


   As oft, with worn and weary feet,

   We tread earth's rugged pathway o'er,

   The thought how comforting and sweet,--

   Christ trod this very path before;

   Our wants, our weaknesses, he knows,

   From life's first dawning to its close.


   If we, beneath temptation's stress,

   Do fight against dark powers within,

   So, in Judea's wilderness,

   Christ wrestled with the thoughts of sin,

   When, in a weary, lonely hour,

   The tempter came with all his power.


   So, tried as I, this earth he trod,

   Knew every human ill but sin,

   And though the holiest Son of God,

   As I am now so hath he been;

   Jesus, my Saviour! look on me;

   For help and strength I turn to thee!

   Holy Son of God most high!

   Clothed in heavenly majesty,

   Many a miracle and sign,

   In thy Father's name divine,

   Manifested forth thy might

   In the chosen people's sight.


   But, O Saviour! not alone

   Thus thy glory was made known;

   With the mourner thou didst grieve,

   Every human want relieve;

   Far thy matchless power above

   Stands the witness of thy love.


   Thou, who by the open grave,

   Ere thy voice was raised to save,

   Didst with those fond sisters shed

   Tears above the faithful dead;

   Even thy word of might appears

   Less resistless than thy tears.


   Lord! it is not ours to gaze

   On thy works of ancient days;

   But thy love, unchanged and bright,

   Fear was within the tossing bark,

   When stormy winds grew loud;

   And waves came rolling high and dark,

   And the tall mast was bowed.


   But the wind ceased,--it ceased,--a word

   Passed through the gloomy sky;

   The troubled billows knew their Lord,

   And sank beneath his eye.


   And slumber settled on the deep,

   And silence on the blast;

   They sank as flowers that fold to sleep

   When sultry day is past.


   O Thou that in its wildest hour

   Didst rule the tempest's mood,

   Send now thy Spirit forth in power

   O'er our dark souls to brood!


   Thou that didst bow the billows' pride,

   Thy mandate to fulfil,

   Speak, speak to passion's raging tide,

   Speak, and say, "Peace, be still!"

   And fervent was his prayer,

   For he, with safety full in view,

   Still languished helpless there.


   His hope grew dim; but one was nigh

   Who saw the sufferer's grief;

   That gentle voice, that pitying eye,

   Gave promise of relief.

   Each pang that human weakness knows

   Obeyed that powerful word;

   He spake, and lo! the sick arose,

   Rejoicing in his Lord.

   With grief and pain we lie,

   And, longing for Thy heavenly rest,

   He died as none but he has died,--

   His every act an act of love.


   His fervent piety was breathed

   To the lone waste, the desert hill;

   And in the haunts of men he sought

   To do his Heavenly Father's will.


   He preached the gospel to the poor,

   Beside the couch of anguish stood,

   Consoled the sufferer, healed the sick,

   And went about still doing good.


   With sinners he conversed, and gave

   Peace to the weary, troubled mind;

   Yet free from stain till life's last hour,

   In him his foes no fault could find.


   Born 'midst the humblest sons of earth,

   All earth's temptations he withstood;

   And yet all human praise renounced,

   Declaring God alone is good.

   Let the birds seek their nest,

   Foxes their holes, and man his peaceful bed;

   Come, Saviour, in my breast

   Come and repose thine oft rejected head!


   Come! give me rest, and take

   The only rest on earth thou lov'st, within

   A heart that for thy sake

   Shall purify itself from every sin.

Through His Poverty Made Rich.


   On the dark-wave of Galilee

   The gloom of twilight gathers fast;

   And o'er the waters heavily

   Sweeps cold and drear the evening blast.


   Still near the lake, with weary tread,

   Lingers a form of human kind;

   And on his lone, unsheltered head,

   Flows the chill night-damp of the wind.


   Why seeks he not a home of rest?

   Why seeks he not the pillowed bed?

   Beasts have their dens, the bird his nest;--

   He hath not where to lay his head.


   Such was the lot he freely chose,

   To bless, to save, the human race;

   And through his poverty there flows

   A rich, full stream of heavenly grace.

   Dark were the paths our Master trod,

   Yet never failed his trust in God;

   Cruel and fierce the wrongs he bore,

   Yet he but felt for man the more.


   Unto the cross in faith he went,

   His Father's willing instrument;

   Upon the cross his prayer arose

   In pity for his ruthless foes.


   O, may we all his kindred be,

   By holy love and sympathy;

   Still loving man through every ill,

   And trusting in our Father's will!

   O suffering Friend of human kind!

   How, as the fatal hour drew near,

   Came thronging on thy holy mind

   The images of grief and fear.


   Gethsemane's sad midnight scene,

   The faithless friends, the exulting foes,

   The thorny crown, the insult keen,

   The scourge, the cross, before thee rose.


   Did not thy spirit shrink dismayed,

   As the dark vision o'er it came;

   And though in sinless strength arrayed,

   Turn, shuddering, from the death of shame?


   Onward, like thee, through scorn and dread,

   May we our Father's call obey,

   Steadfast thy path of duty tread,

   And rise, through death, to endless day.

"Thy Will, Not Mine, Be Done."


   "Father divine!" the Saviour cried,

   While horrors pressed on every side,

   And prostrate on the ground he lay,

   "Remove this bitter cup away.


   "But if these pangs must still be borne,

   Or helpless man be left forlorn,

   I bow my soul before thy throne,

   And say,--Thy will, not mine, be done!"


   Thus our submissive souls would bow,

   And, taught by Jesus, lie as low;

   Our hearts, and not our lips alone,

   Would say,--Thy will, not ours, be done!

"Let This Cup Pass From Me."


   A voice upon the midnight air,

   Where Kedron's moonlit waters stray,

   Weeps forth in agony of prayer,

   "O Father, take this cup away!"


   Ah, thou who sorrow'st unto death,

   We conquer in thy mortal fray;

   And earth for all her children saith,

   "O God, take not this cup away!"


   O Lord of sorrow, meekly die;

   Thou'lt heal or hallow all our woe;

   Thy peace shall still the mourner's sigh;

   Thy strength shall raise the faint and low.


   Great chief of faithful souls, arise;

   None else can lead the martyr band,

   Who teach the soul how peril flies,

   When faith, unarmed, uplifts the hand.


   O King of earth, the cross ascend;

   O'er climes and ages 'tis thy throne;

   Where'er thy fading eye may bend,

   The desert blooms and is thine own.


   Thy parting blessing, Lord, we pray;

   Make but one fold below, above;

   And when we go the last, lone way,

   O, give the welcome of thy love.

The Agony in the Garden.


   He knelt; the Saviour knelt and prayed,

   When but his Father's eye

   Looked, through the lonely garden's shade,

   On that dread agony;

   He poured in prayer his suppliant breath,

   Bowed down with sorrow unto death.


   The sun went down in fearful hour;

   The heavens might well grow dim,

   When this mortality had power

   Thus to o'ershadow him;

   That he who came to save might know

   The very depths of human woe.


   He knew them all,--the doubt, the strife,

   The faint, perplexing dread;

   The mists that hang o'er parting life

   All darkened round his head;

   And the Deliverer knelt to pray;

   Yet passed it not, that cup, away.


   It passed not, though the stormy wave

   Had sunk beneath his tread;

   It passed not, though to him the grave

   Had yielded up its dead;

   But there was sent him, from on high,

   A gift of strength, for man to die.


   And was his mortal hour beset

   With anguish and dismay?

   How may we meet our conflict yet

   In the dark, narrow way?

   How, but through him that path who trod?

   Save, or we perish, Son of God!

   How does the heart o'erflow

   At thought of him the bitter cross who bore!

   But we have each our own,

   To others oft unknown,

   Which we must bear till life shall be no more.


   And shall we fear to tread

   The path where Jesus led,

   The pure and holy one, for man who died?

   Or shall we shrink from shame,

   Endured for Jesus' name,

   Our glorious Lord, once spurned and crucified?


   Then, 'mid the woes that wait

   On this our mortal state,

   Patience shall cheer affliction, toil, and loss,

   And though the tempter's art

   Assail the struggling heart,

   Still, Saviour! in thy name we bear the cross.

   In the Saviour's hour of death,

   Bound upon the cross of fear,

   While his quick and struggling breath

   Spoke the fatal moment near,

   While his proud, triumphant foes

   Mocked the sufferings that he bore,

   Then his loving spirit rose

   More sublime than e'er before.


   He has taught us to forgive,

   By his words in days gone by;

   He has taught us how to live;

   Can he teach us how to die?

   Listen! as the cross they raise,

   One brief prayer ascends to heaven;

   For his murderers he prays,--

   Father, may they be forgiven!

Stabat Mater.


   Jews were wrought to cruel madness,

   Christians fled in fear and sadness,

   Mary stood the cross beside.


   At its foot her foot she planted,

   By the dreadful scene undaunted,

   Till the gentle sufferer died.


   Poets oft have sung her story;

   Painters decked her brow with glory;

   Priests her name have deified;


   But no worship, song, or glory,

   Touches like that simple story,--

   "Mary stood the cross beside."


   And when under fierce oppression

   Goodness suffers like transgression,

   Christ again is crucified.


   But if love be there, true-hearted,

   By no grief or terror parted,

   Mary stands the cross beside.

Easter Hymn.


   Lift your glad voices in triumph on high,

   For Jesus hath risen, and man cannot die.

   Vain were the terrors that gathered around him,

   And short the dominion of death and the grave;

   He burst from the fetters of darkness that bound him,

   Resplendent in glory, to live and to save.

   Loud was the chorus of angels on high,--

   "The Saviour hath risen, and man shall not die."


   Glory to God, in full anthems of joy;

   The being he gave us death cannot destroy.

   Sad were the life we must part with to-morrow,

   If tears were our birthright, and death were our end;

   But Jesus hath cheered the dark valley of sorrow,

   And bade us, immortal, to heaven ascend.

   Lift, then, your voices in triumph on high,

   For Jesus hath risen, and man shall not die.

   On earth was darkness spread,

   One boundless night;

   "Let there be light," God said,--

   And there was light!


   There hung a deeper gloom

   O'er quick and dead,

   But Jesus burst the tomb,

   And darkness fled.


   God by His word arrayed

   Darkness with light;

   God by His Son displayed

   Day without night.


   For thee, O man, arose

   Creation's ray;

   For thee, too, brighter glows

   Salvation's day.

   For mortals shone;

   Communion with our God to seek.


   We see his pitying, gentle eye,

   When lonely want appeals for aid;

   We hear him in the frequent sigh,

   That mourns the waste that sin has made.


   We meet him at the lowly tomb,

   And weep where Jesus wept before;

"Come unto Me."


   Come unto me, when shadows darkly gather,

   When the sad heart is weary and distrest,

   Seeking for comfort from your Heavenly Father,

   Come unto me, and I will give you rest!


   Ye who have mourned when the spring-flowers were taken,

   When the ripe fruit fell richly to the ground,

   When the loved slept, in brighter homes to waken,

   Where their pale brows with spirit-wreaths are crowned;


   Large are the mansions in thy Father's dwelling,

   Glad are the homes that sorrows never dim;

   Sweet are the harps in holy music swelling,

   Soft are the tones which raise the heavenly hymn;


   There, like an Eden blossoming in gladness,

   Bloom the fair flowers the earth too rudely pressed;

   Come unto me, all ye who droop in sadness,

   Come unto me, and I will give you rest.

The Weary and Heavy-Laden.


   Come to Jesus, O my brothers,

   Come in this accepted hour;

   Jesus ready stands to save you,

   Full of pity, love, and power;

   He is able,

   He is willing,--doubt no more.


   Let not conscience make you linger,

   Nor of fitness fondly dream;

   All the fitness he requireth

   Is to feel your need of him;

   This he gives you,--

   'Tis the spirit's struggling beam.


   Come, ye weary, heavy laden;

   Wait not,--'tis your Saviour's call;

   If you tarry till you're better,

   You will never come at all.

   Not the righteous,

   Sinners, Jesus came to call.

Come, Ye Disconsolate.


   Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish;

   Come, at the shrine of God fervently kneel!

   Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;

   Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.


   Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,

   Hope, when all others die, fadeless and pure,

   Here speaks the Comforter, in God's name saying,

   Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.


   Here see the bread of life; see waters flowing

   Forth from the throne of God, living and pure;

   Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing

   Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.

Parting Hymn.


   Through thee as we together came,

   In singleness of heart,

   And met, O Jesus! in thy name,

   So in thy name we part.


   Nearer to thee our spirits lead,

   And still thy love bestow,

   Till thou hast made us free indeed,

   And spotless, here below.


   When to the right or left we stray,

   Leave us not comfortless,

   But guide our feet into the way

   Of everlasting peace.

Benediction.


   The peace which God bestows

   Through him who died and rose,

   The peace the Father giveth through the Son,

   Be known in every mind,

   The broken heart to bind,

   And bless each traveller as he journeys on.


   Ye who have known to weep,

   Where your beloved sleep;

   Ye who have raised the deep, the bitter cry--

   God's blessing be as balm,

   The fevered heart to calm,

   And wondrous peace the troubled mind supply.


   Ere daily strifes begin

   The war without, within,

   The God of love, with spirit and with power,

   Now on each bended head

   His deepest blessing shed,

   And keep us all through every troubled hour.

The Heralds of the Cross.


   Forth went the heralds of the cross,

   No dangers made them pause;

   They counted all the world but loss,

   For their great Master's cause.


   Through looks of fire, and words of scorn,

   Serene their path they trod;

   And to the dreary dungeon borne,

   Sang praises unto God.


   Friends dropped the hand they clasped before,

   Love changed to cruel hate;

   And home to them was home no more;

   Yet mourned they not their fate.


   In all his dark and dread array,

   Death rose upon their sight;

   But calmly still they kept their way,

   And shrank not from the fight.


   They knew to whom their trust was given,

   They could not doubt His word;

   Before them beamed the light of heaven,

   The presence of their Lord.


   O, may a faith as true be ours,

   And shed as pure a light

   Of peace across the darkest hours,

   And make the last one bright!

   Thanks to God for those who came

   In the Saviour's glorious name;

   Who upon the green earth trod

   But to teach the truth of God.


   For the great Apostles, first,

   Who from life's endearments burst,

   Going from the Cross, and then

   Leading to the Cross again:


   For the next, who meekly poured

   Willing blood to serve the Lord;

   Fearless bore the racks of pain,

   Felon's death, or captive's chain;


   And for all, from shore to shore,

   Who the blessed tidings bore;

   All who wrought for liberty

   When 'twas treason to be free.


   Ye, who now, in better days,

   Live to spread your Maker's praise,

   Shedding, each man's home around,

   Light that consecrates the ground;


   Teachers of the word of light,

   Go forth in your Master's might!

   Speed your embassy where'er

   Life has grief, or death has fear!

   Mark the soft falling snow

   And the diffusive rain!

   To heaven, from whence it fell,

   It turns not back again;

   Till, watering earth

   Through every pore,

   It calls forth all

   Her secret store.


   Arrayed in beauteous green,

   The hills and valleys shine,

   And man and beast are fed

   By providence divine:

   The harvest bows

   Its golden ears,

   The copious seed

   Of future years.


   "So," saith the God of grace,

   "My gospel shall descend,

   Almighty to effect

   The purpose I intend;

   Millions of souls

   Shall feel its power,

   And bear it down

   To millions more."

   Upon the souls of men;

   So fresh the dreaming world awoke

   In truth's full radiance then.


   Before yon sun arose,

   Stars clustered through the sky;

   But, O, how dim, how pale, were those,

   To his one burning eye!


   So truth lent many a ray,

   To bless the Pagan's night;

   And fill thy hallowed walls with dread;

   No more shall sin's insulting host

   Though nations with their battle-cries

   Profane the Almighty's name,

   Though bigots to the offended skies

   Their own wild wrath proclaim,--


   Thousands, in every Christian land,

   Have never bowed the knee

   In worship to the idol-band

   Of strife and perfidy.


   And these are one;--though some may bend

   Before the Virgin's shrine,

   While others' prayers and thanks ascend,

   Father! alone at Thine,--


   Yet they are one; if through their hearts

The Kingdom of Heaven.


   Hear what God, the Lord, hath spoken;

   O my people, faint and few,

   Comfortless, afflicted, broken,

   Fair abodes I build for you;

   Scenes of heartfelt tribulation

   Shall no more perplex your ways;

   You shall name your walls salvation,

   And your gates shall all be praise.


   There, in undisturbed possession,

   Peace and righteousness shall reign;

   Never shall you feel oppression,

   Never hear of war again;

   God shall rise, and, shining o'er you,

   Change to day the gloom of night;

   He, the Lord, shall be your glory,

   God your everlasting light.

The Holy Spirit.


   Our blest Redeemer, ere he breathed

   His tender, last farewell,

   A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed,

   With us to dwell.


   He came, in tongues of living flame,

   To teach, convince, subdue;

   All powerful as the wind he came,

   As viewless too.


   He came sweet influence to impart,

   A gracious, willing guest,

   While he can find one humble heart

   Wherein to rest.


   And his that gentle voice we hear,

   Soft as the breath of even,

   That checks each fault, that calms each fear

   And speaks of heaven.


   And every virtue we possess,

   And every victory won,

   And every thought of holiness,

   Are his alone.


   Spirit of purity and grace,

   Our weakness pitying see;

   O, make our hearts Thy dwelling-place,

   And worthier Thee!

The Spirit Saith "Come!"


   The Spirit in our hearts

   Is whispering, "Wanderer, come!"

   The Bride, the church of Christ, proclaims

   To all his children, "Come!"


   Let him that heareth say

   To all about him, "Come!"

   Let him that thirsts for righteousness,

   To Christ, the fountain, come!


   Yes, whosoever will,

   O, let him freely come,

   And freely drink the stream of life;

   'Tis Jesus bids you come.


   Lo! Jesus, who invites,

   Declares, "I quickly come!"

   Lord, even so! I wait thine hour;

   Jesus, my Saviour, come!

   Brother, hast thou wandered far

   From thy Father's happy home,

   With thyself and God at war?

   Turn thee, brother, homeward come!


   Hast thou wasted all the powers

   God for noble uses gave?

   Squandered life's most golden hours?

   Turn thee, brother, God can save!


   Is a mighty famine now

   In thy heart and in thy soul?

   Discontent upon thy brow?

   Turn thee, God will make thee whole!


   He can heal thy bitterest wound,

   He thy gentlest prayer can hear;

   Seek Him, for He may be found;

   Call upon Him; He is near.

Turn, Child of Doubt.

   To error's joyless waste betrayed;

   No light will there illume thy road,

   No friendly voice will give thee aid.


   O, turn, and leave that cheerless waste!

   The shade of death,--the maze of woe!

   There is a path that leads to rest,

   A fount of life is given below.


   Thy friend, thy Lord, from heaven revealed,

   The lost, the erring, to recall,

   That sacred fountain hath unsealed;

   With voice of love he speaks to all.


   He bids the dying wanderer turn,

   To walk in duty's way, and live;

   He speaks to wounded souls that mourn,

   He speaks,--to heal and to forgive.

The Call.


   O, not alone with outward sign

   Of fear, or voice from heaven,

   The message of a truth divine,

   The call of God, is given;

   Awakening in the human heart

   Love for the True and Right,

   Zeal for the Christian's better part,

   Strength for the Christian's fight.


   Though heralded by naught of fear,

   Or outward sign, or show;

   Though only to the inward ear

   It whisper soft and low;

   Though dropping as the manna fell,

   Unseen, yet from above,

   Holy and gentle, heed it well,--

   The call to Truth and Love.

Thou Must Be Born Again.


   Thou must be born again!

   Such was the solemn word

   To him who came, not all in vain,

   By night to seek his Lord.


   Thou must be born again!

   But not the birth of clay;

   The immortal seed must thence obtain

   Deliverance into day.


   Thou, in thy inmost mind,

   Must own the same control;

   The same regenerating wind

   Must move and guide thy soul.


   Thou canst not choose but trace

   The steps the Master trod,

   If once thou feel his truth and grace,

   A conscious child of God.


   The mortal's birth is past;

   The immortal's birth must be;

   Seek well and thou shalt find at last

   That blest nativity.

A Penitential Hymn.


   God of mercy! God of love!

   Hear our sad, repentant songs;

   Listen to Thy suppliant ones,

   Thou, to whom all grace belongs!


   Deep regret for follies past,

   Talents wasted, time misspent;

   Hearts debased by worldly cares,

   Thankless for the blessings lent;--


   Foolish fears and fond desires,

   Vain regrets for things as vain;

   Lips too seldom taught to praise,

   Oft to murmur and complain;--


   These, and every secret fault,

   Filled with grief and shame, we own;

   Humbled at Thy feet we bow,

   Seeking strength from Thee alone.


   God of mercy! God of love!

   O, restore Thy suppliant ones,

   O, send me not away! for I would drink,

   Even I, the weakest, at the fount of life;

   Chide not my steps, that venture near the brink,

   Weary and fainting from the deadly strife.


   Went I not forth undaunted and alone,

   Strong in the majesty of human might?

   Lo! I return, all wounded and forlorn,

   My dream of glory lost in shades of night.


   Was I not girded for the battle-field?

   Bore I not helm of pride and glittering sword?

   Behold the fragments of my broken shield,

   And lend to me Thy heavenly armor, Lord!

   To idols I have given;

   Too oft have bound to earth the hopes

   That know no home but heaven.


   Unworthy to be called Thy son,

   I come with shame to Thee,

   Hast always been to me!


   Help me to break the heavy chains

   The world has round me thrown,

   And know the glorious liberty

   Of an obedient son.


   That I may henceforth heed whate'er

   Thy voice within me saith,

   Fix deeply in my heart of hearts

   A principle of faith,--

   That looks to Thee when sin is near,

   And bids the tempter fly;

   A spirit still prepared,

   And armed with jealous care,

   Forever standing on its guard,

   And watching unto prayer.


   I want a true regard,

   A single, steady aim,

   Unmoved by threatening or reward,

   To Thee and Thy great name;

   This blessing above all,

   Always to pray, I want:

   Out of the deep on Thee to call,

   And never, never faint.


   I rest upon Thy word;

   The promise is for me;

   My succor and salvation, Lord,

   Shall surely come from Thee;

   But let me still abide,

   Nor from my hope remove,

   Till Thou my patient spirit guide

   Into Thy perfect love.

   Pants the living God to see;

   When, O, when, without a fear,

Seeking Rest.


   O, where shall rest be found,

   Rest for the weary soul?

   'Twere vain the ocean depths to sound,

   Or pierce to either pole:


   The world can never give

   The rest for which we sigh;

   'Tis not the whole of life to live,

   Nor all of death to die.


   In Thee we end our quest;

   Alone are found in Thee

   The life of perfect love,--the rest

   Of immortality.

There Remaineth a Rest for the People of God.


   Lord, I believe a rest remains,

   To all Thy people known;

   A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,

   And Thou art loved alone.


   A rest, where all our soul's desire

   Is fixed on things above;

   Where fear, and sin, and grief expire,

   Cast out by perfect love.


   O, that I now that rest might know,

   Believe, and enter in;

   Now, Father, now the power bestow,

   And let me cease from sin.


   Remove all hardness from my heart,

   All unbelief remove;

   O Lord! how happy should we be,

   If we could leave our cares to Thee,

   If we from self could rest,

   And feel at heart that One above,

   In perfect wisdom, perfect love,

   Is working for the best.


   For when we kneel and cast our care

   Upon our God in humble prayer,

   With strengthened souls we rise;

   Sure that our Father, who is nigh

   To hear the ravens when they cry,

   Will hear His children's cries.


   O, may these trustless hearts of ours

   The lesson learn from birds and flowers,

   And learn from self to cease,--

   Leave all things to our Father's will,

   And, on His mercy, leaning still,

   Find, in each trial, peace!

   Absent from Thee I roam;

   Yet nightly pitch my moving tent

   A day's march nearer home.


   My Father's house on high!

   Home of my soul, how near

   At times to faith's foreseeing eye

   Thy golden gates appear!


   I hear at morn and even,

   At noon and midnight hour,

   The choral harmonies of heaven

   Earth's Babel-tongues o'erpower.


   And then I feel, that He,

   Remembered or forgot,

   The Lord, is never far from me,

   Though I perceive Him not.


   Forever with the Lord!

   And nought desire or seek, but Thee.

   Each hour within my soul renew

   This holy flame, this heavenly fire;

   And day and night be all my care

   May follow Thee, and never rest,

   Till sweetly Thou hast breathed a mild

   And lowly mind into my breast!

   Nor ever may we parted be,

   Till I become as one with Thee.


   Still let Thy love point out my way;

   How wondrous things that love hath wrought!

   Still lead me, lest I go astray;

   Direct my word, inspire my thought;

   And if I fall, soon may I hear

   Thy voice, and know Thy love is near.

The Mysteries of God's Providence.


   God moves in a mysterious way,

   His wonders to perform;

   He plants His footsteps in the sea,

   And rides upon the storm.


   Deep in unfathomable mines

   Of never-failing skill,

   He treasures up His vast designs,

   And works His sovereign will.


   Ye fearful saints! fresh courage take;

   The clouds ye so much dread

   Are big with mercy, and will break

   In blessings on your head.


   Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,

   But trust Him for His grace;

   Behind a frowning providence

   He hides a smiling face.


   His purposes will ripen fast,

   Unfolding every hour;

   The bud may have a bitter taste,

   But sweet will be the flower.


   Blind unbelief is sure to err,

   And scan his work in vain;

   God is His own interpreter,

   And He will make it plain.

   Author of good, we rest on Thee;

   Thine ever watchful eye

   Alone our real wants can see,

   Thy hand alone supply.


   In Thine all-gracious providence

   Our cheerful hopes confide;

   O, let Thy power be our defence,

   Thy love our footsteps guide!


   And since, by passion's force subdued,

   Too oft, with stubborn will,

   We blindly shun the latent good,

   And grasp the specious ill,--


   Not what we wish, but what we want,

   Thy mercy still supply!

   The good unasked, O Father, grant;

   The ill, though asked, deny!

Reliance.


   Through all the various shifting scene

   Of life's mistaken ill or good,

   Thy hand, O God! conducts, unseen,

   The beautiful vicissitude.


   Thou givest with paternal care,

   Howe'er unjustly we complain,

   To all their necessary share

   Of joy and sorrow, health and pain.


   All things on earth, and all in heaven,

   On Thine eternal will depend;

   And all for greater good were given,

   Would man pursue the appointed end.


   Be this my care!--to all beside

   Indifferent let my wishes be;

   Passion be calm, and dumb be pride,

   And fixed my soul, great God! on Thee.

   The sundered ties shall be

   A closer bond, in time to come,

Thy Will Be Done.


   My God, my Father, while I stray

   Far from my home on life's rough way,

   O, teach me from my heart to say,

   Thy will, my God, be done!


   Though dark my path, and sad my lot,

   Let me be still, and murmur not,

   But breathe the prayer divinely taught,

   Thy will, my God, be done!


   What though in lonely grief I sigh

   For friends beloved, no longer nigh?

   Submissive still would I reply,

   Thy will, my God, be done!


   If Thou shouldst call me to resign

   What most I prize,--it ne'er was mine,--

   I only yield Thee what is Thine;

   Thy will, my God, be done!


   Should pining sickness waste away

   My life in premature decay,

   In life or death teach me to say,

   Thy will, my God, be done!


   Renew my will from day to day,

   Blend it with Thine, and take away

   Whate'er now makes it hard to say,

   But with humble faith to see

   Love inscribed upon them all,--

   This is happiness to me.


   God in Israel sows the seeds

   Of affliction, pain, and toil;

   These spring up, and choke the weeds

   Which would else o'erspread the soil;

   All I've sought, or hoped, or known,

   Yet, how rich is my condition!

   God and heaven are still mine own.


   Know, my soul, thy full salvation;

   Rise o'er sin, and fear, and care;

   Joy to find, in every station,

   Something still to do and bear.


   Think what Spirit dwells within thee;

   Think what Father's smiles are thine;

   Think that Jesus died to win thee;

   Child of heaven, canst thou repine?


   Haste thee on from cross to glory,

   Armed by faith and winged by prayer;

   Heaven's eternal day's before thee,

   God's own hand shall lead thee there.

Faith.


   The dove, let loose in Eastern skies,

   Returning fondly home,

   Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies

   Where idle warblers roam;


   But high she shoots through air and light,

   Above all low delay,

   Where nothing earthly bounds her flight,

   Nor shadow dims her way.


   So grant me, Lord, from every snare

   And stain of passion free,

   Aloft, through faith's serener air,

   To urge my course to Thee:


   No sin to cloud, no lure to stay,

   My soul, as home she springs;

   Thy sunshine on her joyful way,

   Thy freedom on her wings!

The Strength of Hope.


   The world may change from old to new,

   From new to old again;

   Yet hope and heaven, forever true,

   Within man's heart remain.

   The dreams that bless the weary soul,

   The struggles of the strong,

   Are steps towards some happy goal,

   The story of hope's song.


   Hope leads the child to plant the flower,

   The man to sow the seed;

   Nor leaves fulfilment to her hour,--

   But prompts again to deed.

   And ere upon the old man's dust

   The grass is seen to wave,

   We look through falling tears, to trust

   Hope's sunshine on the grave.


   O, no! it is no flattering lure,

   No fancy weak or fond,

   When hope would bid us rest secure

   In better life beyond.

   Nor love, nor shame, nor grief, nor sin,

   Her promise may gainsay;

   The voice divine hath spoke within,

   And God did ne'er betray.

   Not now for breath of summer flowers,

   For smiles of sunny skies,

   The still, small voice of gratitude

   Shall to Thine ear arise.


   I bless Thee for the ministry

   Of sorrow's lonely hour,

   When darkly o'er my stricken head

   I see the storm-clouds lower;

   Thy love can still the billows' roar,

   And whisper, "Peace; be still!"

   While faith doth on Thy promise rest,

   And bless the Father's will.


   The shadow and the storm must come;

   O, grant that faith divine

   Which triumphs o'er the might of grief,

   And moulds man's will to Thine!

   The stars of heaven are shining on,

   Though these frail eyes are dimmed with tears;

   And though the hopes of earth be gone,

   Yet are not ours the immortal years?


   Father! forgive the heart that clings,

   Thus trembling, to the things of time;

   And bid the soul, on angel wings,

   Ascend into a purer clime.


   There shall no doubts disturb its trust,

   No sorrows dim celestial love;

   But these afflictions of the dust,

   Like shadows of the night, remove.

Patience.


   Shall we grow weary in our watch,

   And murmur at the long delay,

   Impatient of our Father's time

   And his appointed way?


   O, oft a deeper test of faith

   Than prison-cell, or martyr's stake,

   The self-renouncing watchfulness

   Of silent prayer may make.


   We gird us bravely to rebuke

   Our erring brother in the wrong;

   And in the ear of pride and power

   Our warning voice is strong.


   Easier to smite with Peter's sword

   Than watch one hour in humbling prayer;

   Life's great things, like the Syrian lord,

   Our hearts can do and dare:


   But, O, we shrink from Jordan's side,

   From waters which alone can save;

   And murmur for Abana's banks

   And Pharpar's brighter wave.


   O Thou, who in the garden's shade

   Didst wake thy weary ones again,

   Who slumbered at that fearful hour,

   Forgetful of thy pain,--


   Bend o'er us now, as over them,

   And set our sleep-bound spirits free,

   Nor leave us slumbering in the watch

   Our souls should keep with thee!

   Who shall make trouble, then? Not evil minds

   Which like a shadow o'er creation lower;

   The soul which peace hath thus attunéd finds

   How strong within doth reign the Calmer's power.


   What shall make trouble? Not the holy thought

   Of the departed; that will be a part

   Of those undying things His peace hath wrought

   Into a world of beauty in the heart.

   Go, bend to God, and leave to Him

   The mystery of thy brother's heart,

Faith and Works.


   One cup of healing oil and wine,

   One tear-drop shed on mercy's shrine,

   Is thrice more grateful, Lord, to Thee,

   Than lifted eye or bended knee.


   In true and genuine faith we trace

   The source of every Christian grace;

   Within the pious heart it plays,

   A living fount of joy and praise.


   Kind deeds of peace and love betray

   Where'er the stream has found its way;

   But where these spring not rich and fair,

   The stream has never wandered there.

The Golden Rule.


   Thus said Jesus:--"Go and do

   As thou wouldst be done unto:"

   Here thy perfect duty see,

   All that God requires of thee.


   Wouldst thou, when thy faults are known,

   Wish that pardon should be shown?

   Be forgiving, then, and do

   As thou wouldst be done unto.


   Shouldst thou helpless be and poor,

   Wouldst thou not for aid implore?

   Think of others, then, and be

   What thou wouldst they should to thee.


   For compassion if thou call,

   Be compassionate to all;

   If thou wouldst affection find,

   Be affectionate and kind.


   If thou wouldst obtain the love

   Of thy gracious God above,

   Then to all His children be

   What thou wouldst they should to thee.

Who Is My Neighbor?


   Who is thy neighbor? he whom thou

   Hast power to aid or bless;

   Whose aching heart or burning brow

   Thy soothing hand may press.


   Thy neighbor? 'tis the fainting poor,

   Whose eye with want is dim;

   O, enter thou his humble door,

   With aid and peace for him.


   Thy neighbor? he who drinks the cup

   When sorrow drowns the brim;

   With words of high, sustaining hope,

   Go thou and comfort him.


   Thy neighbor? 'tis the weary slave,

   Fettered in mind and limb;

   He hath no hope this side the grave;

   Go thou and ransom him.


   Thy neighbor? pass no mourner by;

   Perhaps thou canst redeem

   A breaking heart from misery;

   Go, share thy lot with him.

The Law of Love.

   2 Kings, iv. 3.


   Pour forth the oil,--pour boldly forth;

   It will not fail, until

   Thou failest vessels to provide

   Which it may largely fill.


   Make channels for the streams of love,

   Where they may broadly run;

   And love has overflowing streams,

   To fill them every one.


   But if at any time we cease

   Such channels to provide,

   The very founts of love for us

   Will soon be parched and dried.


   For we must share, if we would keep

   That blessing from above;

   Ceasing to give, we cease to have;--

   Such is the law of love.

Words and Deeds.


   Beneath the thick but struggling clouds,

   We talk of Christian life;

   The words of Jesus on our lips,

   Our hearts with man at strife.


   Traditions, forms, and selfish aims,

   Have dimmed the inner light;

   Have closely veiled the spirit-world

   And angels from our sight.


   Strong souls and willing hands we need,

   Our temple to repair;

   Remove the gathering dust of years,

   And show the model fair.


   We slumber while the present calls,

   But darkness grows with rest;

   Wouldst thou see truth? To action wake,--

   Do the divine behest.

Heaven on Earth.


   This world is not a fleeting show,

   For man's illusion given;

   He that hath soothed a widow's woe,

   Or wiped an orphan's tear, doth know

   There's something here of heaven.


   And he who walks life's thorny way

   With feelings calm and even,

   Whose path is lit, from day to day,

   By virtue's bright and steady ray,

   Feels something here of heaven.


   He that the Christian course hath run,

   And all his foes forgiven,

   Hath measured out this life's short span

   In love to God and love to man,

   On earth has tasted heaven.

Blessed Are Ye That Sow Beside All Waters.


   O, be not faithless! with the morn

   Cast thou abroad thy grain!

   At noontide faint not thou forlorn,

   At evening sow again!

   Blessed are they, whate'er betide,

   Who thus all waters sow beside.


   Thou knowest not which seed shall grow,

   Or which may die, or live;

   In faith, and hope, and patience, sow!

   The increase God shall give,

   According to His gracious will,--

   As best his purpose may fulfil.


   O, could our inward eye but view,

   Our hearts but feel aright,

   What faith, and love, and hope, can do,

   By their celestial might,

   We should not say, till these be dead,

   The power of miracle is fled.

Love On!


   Love on! love on! but not the things that own

   The fleeting beauty of a summer day;

   Truth, virtue, spring from God's eternal throne,

   Nor quit the spirit when it leaves the clay:

   Love them! love them!


   Love on! love on! though death and earthly change

   Bring mournful silence to a darkened home;

   Still let the heart rest where no eye grows strange,

   Where never falls a shadow from the tomb:

   Love there! love there!


   Love on! love on! the voice of grief and wrong

   Comes from the palace and the poor man's cot;

   Bid the proud bend, and bid the weak be strong,

   And life's tired pilgrim meekly bear his lot:

   Give strength! give peace!


   Love on! love on! and though the evening still

   Wear the stern clouds that veiled thy noonday sun,

   With changeless trust, with calm, unwavering will,

   Work! bravely work! till the last hour be done:

   Love God! love Man!

As Ye Sow, So Shall Ye Reap.


   The bud will soon become a flower,

   The flower become a seed;

   Then seize, O youth, the present hour,--

   Of that thou hast most need.


   Do thy best always,--do it now,--

   For in the present time,

   As in the furrows of a plough,

   Fall seeds of good or crime.


   The sun and rain will ripen fast

   Each seed that thou hast sown;

   And every act and word at last

   By its own fruit be known.


   And soon the harvest of thy toil

   Rejoicing thou shalt reap;

   Or o'er thy wild, neglected soil

   Go forth in shame to weep.

   Of another clime?


   Early hath life's mighty question

   Thrilled within thy heart of youth,

   With a deep and strong beseeching,--

   What, and where, is truth?


   Not to ease and aimless quiet

   Doth the inward answer tend;

   But to works of love and duty,

   As our being's end.


   Earnest toil and strong endeavor

   Of a spirit which within

   Wrestles with familiar evil

   And besetting sin;


   And without, with tireless vigor,

   Steady heart, and purpose strong,

   In the power of Truth assaileth

   Every form of wrong.

Divine Meaning in Humble Things.

   O, grant that we may own Thy hand

   No less in every grain of sand!


   With forests huge, of dateless time,

   Thy will has hung each peak sublime;

   But withered leaves beneath the tree

   Have tongues that tell as loud of Thee.


   Teach us that not a leaf can grow,

   Till life from Thee within it flow;

   That not a grain of dust can be,

   O Fount of being! save by Thee;


   That every human word and deed,

   Hath solemn meaning from above,

   Begun and ended all in love.

Seeing God in All.


   If on our daily course our mind

   Be set, to hallow all we find,

   New treasures still, of countless price,

   God will provide for sacrifice.


   Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,

   As more of heaven in each we see;

   Some softening gleam of love and prayer

   Shall dawn on every cross and care.


   O could we learn that sacrifice,

   What light would all around us rise!

   How would our hearts with wisdom talk

   Along life's dullest, dreariest walk!


   The trivial round, the common task,

   Will furnish all we ought to ask;

   Room to deny ourselves, a road

   To bring us daily nearer God.

Forms Vain Without the Spirit.


   The uplifted eye and bended knee

   Are but vain homage, Lord, to Thee:

   In vain our lips Thy praise prolong,

   The heart a stranger to the song.


   Can rites, and forms, and flaming zeal,

   The breaches of Thy precepts heal?

   Or fasts and penance reconcile

   Thy justice, and obtain Thy smile?


   The pure, the humble, contrite mind,

   Sincere, and to Thy will resigned,

   To Thee a nobler offering yields

   Than Sheba's groves, or Sharon's fields.


   Love God and man,--this great command

   Doth on eternal pillars stand;

   This did Thine ancient prophets teach,

   And this Thy well-beloved preach.

   All the beauty God has given;

   But beware it does not win us

   From the work ordained of Heaven.

   With a trusting, loving heart;

   Let us in life's earnest labor

   Still be sure to do our part.


   Now, to-day, and not to-morrow,

   Let us work with all our might,

   Lest the wretched faint and perish

   In the coming stormy night.

Effort.


   Scorn not the slightest word or deed,

   Nor deem it void of power;

   There's fruit in each wind-wafted seed,

   That waits its natal hour.


   A whispered word may touch the heart,

   And call it back to life;

   A look of love bid sin depart,

   And still unholy strife.


   No act falls fruitless; none can tell

   How vast its power may be,

   Nor what results infolded dwell

   Within it silently.


   Work on, despair not; bring thy mite,

   Nor care how small it be;

   God is with all that serve the right,

   The holy, true, and free.

   O'er the mount and through the moor

   Glide the Christian's steps secure;

   Lonely, but with God, he goes:

   For the coat of mail, bedight

   In his spotless robe of white;

   For the sinful sword, his hand

   Bearing high the olive-wand.


   Through the camp, and through the court,

   Through the dark and deadly fort,

   On the mission of the dove,

   Speeds the minister of love;

   By his word the wildest tames,

   And the world to God reclaims;

   Hushed around his path of peace.

Psalm of Life.


   Tell me not, in mournful numbers,

   Life is but an empty dream;

   For the soul is dead that slumbers,

   And things are not what they seem.


   Life is real! life is earnest!

   And the grave is not its goal;

   Dust thou art, to dust returnest,

   Was not spoken of the soul.


   Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,

   Is our destined end and way;

   But to act, that each to-morrow

   Find us further than to-day.


   Lives of true men all remind us

   We can make our lives sublime,

   And, departing, leave behind us

   Footprints on the sands of time;


   Footprints which perhaps another,

   Sailing o'er life's solemn main,

   A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,

   Seeing, shall take heart again.


   Let us, then, be up and doing,

   With a heart for any fate;

   Still achieving, still pursuing,

   Learn to labor and to wait.

Refuge in God.


   We would leave, O God, to Thee,

   Every anxious care and fear;

   Thou the troubled thought canst see,

   Thou canst dry the bitter tear.


   Thou dost care for us, we know,--

   Care with all a Father's love;

   Thou canst make each earthly woe

   Work to higher bliss above.


   On this faith we fain would rest;

   Strengthen Thou its blessed power!

   Steadfast keep it in our breast,

   Through each dark and trying hour.

The Use of Tears.


   How little of ourselves we know,

   Before a grief the heart has felt!

   The lessons that we learn of woe

   Make strong the soul, as well as melt.


   The energies too stern for mirth,

   The reach of thought, the strength of will,

   'Mid cloud and tempest have their birth,

   Though blight and blast their course fulfil.


   And yet 'tis when it mourns and fears,

   The laden spirit feels forgiven;

   And through the mist of falling tears

   We catch the clearest glimpse of heaven.

Blessed Are They That Mourn.


   Deem not that they are blest alone

   Whose days a peaceful tenor keep;

   The God who loves our race has shown

   A blessing for the eyes that weep.


   The light of smiles shall fill again

   The lids that now o'erflow with tears,

   And weary hours of woe and pain

   Are earnests of serener years.


   O, there are days of hope and rest

   For every dark and troubled night!

   And grief may bide, an evening guest,

   But joy shall come with morning light.


   And ye, who o'er a friend's low bier

   Now shed the bitter drops like rain,

   Know that a brighter, happier sphere

   Will give him to your arms again.

   My God, I thank Thee! may no thought

   E'er deem Thy chastisements severe;

   But may this heart, by sorrow taught,

   Calm each wild wish, each idle fear.


   Thy mercy bids all nature bloom;

   The sun shines bright, and man is gay;

   Thine equal mercy spreads the gloom

   That darkens o'er his little day.


   Full many a throb of grief and pain

   Thy frail and erring child must know;

   But not one prayer is breathed in vain,

   Nor does one tear unheeded flow.


   Thy various messengers employ;

   Thy purposes of love fulfil;

   And, 'mid the wreck of human joy,

   Let kneeling faith adore Thy will.

Weeping Seedtime; Joyful Harvest.


   The darkened sky, how thick it lowers!

   Troubled with storms, and big with showers,

   No cheerful gleam of light appears,

   But nature pours forth all her tears.


   Yet let the sons of God revive;

   He bids the soul that seeks Him live,

   And from the gloomiest shade of night

   Calls forth a morning of delight.


   The seeds of ecstasy unknown

   Are in these watered furrows sown;

   See the green blades, how thick they rise,

   And with fresh verdure bless our eyes!


   In secret foldings they contain

   Unnumbered ears of golden grain;

   And heaven shall pour its beams around,

   Till the ripe harvest load the ground.


   Then shall the trembling mourner come,

   And bind his sheaves, and bear them home,

   The voice long broke with sighs shall sing,

   Till heaven with hallelujahs ring.

Affliction, God's Angel.


   Affliction's faded form draws nigh,

   With wrinkled brow and downcast eye;

   With sackcloth on her bosom spread,

   And ashes scattered o'er her head.


   But deem her not a child of earth;

   From heaven she draws her sacred birth;

   Beside the throne of God she stands

   To execute his kind commands.


   The messenger of love, she flies

   To train us for our sphere, the skies;

   And onward as we move, the way

   Becomes more smooth, more bright the day.


   Her weeds to robes of glory turn,

   Her looks with kindling radiance burn;

   And from her lips these accents steal,--

   "God smites to bless, he wounds to heal!"

   Shines beauteous in the vaulted sky,

   Which prosperous days refused;

   As herbs, though scentless when entire,

   Spread fragrance when they're bruised.


   The oak strikes deeper as its boughs

   By furious blasts are driven;

   So life's tempestuous storms the more

   Have fixed my heart in heaven.


   All gracious Lord! whate'er my lot

   A life the immortal soul must win,--

   The life of joy and faith.


   For this the Father's love

   Doth shade the world of sense,

   The bounding play of health remove,

   And dim the sparkling glance;


   That, though the earth grows dull

   And earthly pleasures few,

   The spirit gain its wisdom full

   To suffer and to do.


   Holy its world within,

   Unknown to sound or sight,--

   The world of victory o'er sin,

   Of faith, and love, and light.

   Cold though the world be, in the way before thee

   Wail not in sadness o'er the darkling tomb;

   Light shineth still above the clouds of gloom.

   Night only known beneath the sky of time,

   Faith can behold the dawning of a morrow

   Glowing in smiles of life and joy sublime.

   With silence only as their benediction,

   God's angels come

   Where, in the shadow of a great affliction,

   The soul sits dumb.


   Yet would we say, what every heart approveth,--

   Our Father's will,

   Calling to Him the dear ones whom he loveth,

   Is mercy still.


   Not upon us or ours the solemn angel

   Hath evil wrought;

   The funeral anthem is a glad evangel;

   The good die not!


   God calls our loved ones, but we lose not wholly

   What He has given;

Ministering Angels.


   Brother, the angels say,

   Peace to thy heart!

   We, too, O brother, have

   Been as thou art,--

   Hope-lifted, doubt-depressed,

   Seeing in part,

   Tried, troubled, tempted,

   Sustained, as thou art.


   Brother, they softly say,

   Be our thoughts one;

   Bend thou with us and pray,

   "Thy will be done!"

   Our God is thy God;

   He willeth the best;

   Trust Him as we trusted--

   Rest as we rest!


   Ye, too, they gently say,

   Shall angels be;

   Ye, too, O brothers,

   From earth shall be free:

   Yet in earth's loved ones

   Ye still shall have part,

   Bearing God's strength and love

   To the torn heart.


   Thus when the spirit, tried

   Tempted and worn,

   Finding no earthly aid,

   Heavenward doth turn,--

   Come these sweet angel-tones,

   Falling like balm,

   And on the troubled heart

   Steals a deep calm.

   When, on devotion's seraph wing,

   The spirit soars above,

   And feels Thy presence, Father, Friend,

   God of eternal love!

   The joys of earth, how swift they fade

   Before that living ray,

   Which gives to the rapt soul a glimpse

   Of pure and perfect day!


   A gleam of Heaven's own light, though now

   Its brightness scarce appears

   Through the pale shadows that are spread

   Around our earthly years;

   But Thine unclouded smile, O God!

   Fills that all-glorious place,

   Where we shall know as we are known,

   And see Thee, face to face.

   Where all the sounds of weeping cease,

   Fear hath no dwelling here;

   But pure repose and love

   Breathe through the bright, celestial air

   The spirit of the dove.


   Come to the bright and blest,

   Gathered from every land;

   For here thy soul shall find its rest,

   Amidst the shining band.


   In this divine abode

   Change leaves no saddening trace;

   Come, trusting spirit, to thy God,

   Thy holy resting-place!

   O, heaven is where no secret dread

   May haunt us by its power;

   Where from the past no gloom is shed

   Upon the present hour.


   And there the living waters flow

   Along the radiant shore;

   The soul, now wandering here, shall know

   Its burning thirst no more.


   The burden of the stranger's heart,

   Which here unknown we bear,

   Like the night-shadow shall depart

   With our first wakening there.


   And, borne on eagle's wings afar,

   Free thought shall claim its dower,

   From every sphere, from every star,

   Of glory and of power.

A Hymn of Morning.


   Sweet morn! from countless cups of gold,

   Thou liftest reverently on high

   More incense fine than earth can hold,

   To fill the sky.


   Where'er the vision's boundaries glance,

   Existence swells with living power,

   And all the illumined earth's expanse

   Inhales the hour.


   In man, O morn! a loftier good,

   With conscious blessing, fills the soul,--

   A life by reason understood,

   Which metes the whole.


   To thousand tasks of fruitful hope,

   With skill against his toil, he bends,

   And finds his work's determined scope

   Where'er he wends.


   From earth and earthly toil and strife

   To deathless aims his soul may rise,

   Each dawn may wake to better life,

   With purer eyes.


   Such grace from Thee, O God, be ours,

   Renewed with every morning's ray,

   And freshening still with added flowers

   Each future day.


   To man is given one primal star;

   One dayspring's beam has dawned below;

   From Thine our inmost glories are,

   With Thine we glow.


   Like earth awake and warm and bright,

   With joy the spirit moves and burns;

   So up to Thee, O Fount of Light,

   Our light returns.

   How to find all strength in Thee,

   And a perfect triumph win

   Over every bosom sin.

   Nor thoughts that idly rove,

   And while the hours in order flow,

   Securely keep, O God,

   Our hearts, beleaguered by the foe

   That tempts our every road.

   If we have faltered or transgressed,

   Guide, from Thy love's abundant source,

   The songs which from Thy churches rise.


   Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love;

   But there's a nobler rest above;

   To that our longing souls aspire,

   With earnest hope and strong desire.


   No more fatigue, no more distress;

   Nor sin nor death shall reach the place;

   No groans to mingle with the songs

   Which warble from immortal tongues.


   No rude alarms of raging foes;

   No cares to break the long repose;

   No midnight shade, no clouded sun,

   But sacred, high, eternal noon.


   O long expected day, begin;

   Dawn on these realms of woe and sin!

   Fain would we leave this weary road,

   And pass through death, to rest with God.

   For peace and joy and love,

   In Faith and Love be hushed.

Sabbath Evening.


   Within Thy courts have millions met,

   Millions this day before Thee bowed;

   Their faces heavenward were set,

   Their vows to Thee, O God! they vowed.


   Still as the light of morning broke

   O'er island, continent, and deep,

   Thy far-spread family awoke,

   Sabbath all round the world to keep.


   From east to west the sun surveyed,

   From north to south, adoring throngs;

   And still where evening stretched her shade

   The stars came forth to hear their songs.


   And not a prayer, a tear, a sigh,

   Hath failed this day some suit to gain;

   To hearts that sought Thee Thou wast nigh

   Nor hath one sought Thy face in vain.


   The poor in spirit Thou hast fed,

   The feeble soul hath strengthened been.

   The mourner Thou hast comforted,

   The pure in heart their God have seen.


   And Thou, soul-searching God! hast known

   The hearts of all that bent the knee,

   And all their prayers have reached Thy throne,

   In soul and truth who worshipped Thee.

   A voice athwart the heavens flashed,

   The Baptist, gazing on his face,

   With the soul's radiance bright,

   Beheld upon his sacred head

   A snow-white dove alight.


   Now with baptismal waters touched,

   Thy children, Father, see!

   While heart and soul, and mind and strength,

   They consecrate to Thee.


   Send down on them Thy holy dove,

   Thy spirit undefiled;

   Be each in purity and faith

   Thy well-beloved child!


   O help them in the wilderness

   To conquer doubt and sin;

   To see above them still Thy Peace,

   And hear Thy voice within!

   There are Thy temples, God of all!


   The tombs Thine altars are; for there,

   When earthly loves and hopes have fled,

   To Thee ascends the spirit's prayer,

   Thou God of the immortal dead!


   All space is holy, for all space

   Is filled by Thee;--but human thought

   Burns clearer in some chosen place,

   Where Thine own words of love are taught.


   Here be they taught; and may we know

   That faith Thy servants knew of old,

   Which onward bears, through weal or woe,

   Till death the gates of heaven unfold.

   Shows yet no trace of human cares

   May his rebuke be strong!


   And as he doth Christ's footsteps press,

   If e'er his faith grow dim,

   Then, in the dreary wilderness,

   Thine angels strengthen him!


   And give him in Thy holy work

   Patience to wait Thy time,

   And, toiling still with man, to breathe

   The soul's serener clime.

   Beneath thy blue-domed temple,

   One general hymn of praise

   To Thee, the ever-living,

   The universal King,

   Who never ceasest giving

   Each good and perfect thing.


   The streamlet from the mountain,--

   It speaketh, Lord, of Thee,

   As from its snow-capped fountain

   It rushes to the sea;

   The gentle dew descending,

   And cloud's refreshing shower,--

   O God, our Heavenly Father,

   All, all, proclaim Thy power.

Hymn of Spring.


   Praise the Lord, when blushing morning

   Wakes the blossoms fresh with dew!

   When the world, again created,

   Beams with beauties fair and new!


   Praise the Lord, when early breezes

   Come so fragrant from the flowers!

   Praise, thou willow by the brookside!

   Praise, ye birds, among the bowers!


   Praise the Lord! and may His blessing

   Guide us in the way of truth,

   Keep our feet from paths of error,

   Make us holy in our youth.


   Praise the Lord, ye hosts of heaven!

   Angels, sing your sweetest lays!

   All things utter forth His glory!

   Sound your great Creator's praise!

The Hymn of Summer.


   How glad the tone when summer's sun

   Wreaths the gay world with flowers,

   And trees bend down with golden fruit,

   And birds are in their bowers!


   The morn sends silent music down

   Upon each earthly thing;

   And always since creation's dawn

   The stars together sing.


   Shall man remain in silence, then,

   While all beneath the skies

   The chorus joins? no, let us sing,

   And while our voices rise,


   O, let our lives, great God, breathe forth

   A constant melody;

   And every action be a tone

   In that sweet hymn to Thee!

   The earth, all light and loveliness,

   In summer's golden hours,

   Shines, in her bridal vesture clad,

   And crowned with festal flowers,

   So radiantly beautiful,

   So like to heaven above,

   We scarce can deem more fair that world

   Of perfect bliss and love.


   Is this a shadow faint and dim

   Of that which is to come!

   What shall the unveiled splendor be

   Of our celestial home,

   Where waves the glorious tree of life,

   Where streams of bliss gush free,

   And all is glowing in the light

   Of immortality!

   Fountain of life, and God of love!

   How rich Thy bounties are!

   The rolling seasons, as they move,

   Proclaim Thy constant care.


   When in the bosom of the earth

   The sower hid the grain,

   Thy goodness marked its secret birth,

   And sent the early rain.


   The spring's sweet influence, Lord, was Thine,

   Its mild, refreshing showers;

   Thou gav'st the ripening suns to shine,

   And summer's golden hours.


   Thy quickening life, forever near,

   Matured the swelling grain;--

   The bounteous harvest crowns the year,

   And plenty fills the plain.


   With thankful hearts we trace Thy way

   Through all our smiling vales;

   House of our God, with cheerful anthems ring,

   While all our lips and hearts His mercies sing;

   The fruitful year His bounties shall proclaim,

   And all its days be vocal with His name.

   The Lord is good, His mercy never-ending,

   His blessings in perpetual showers descending.


   The earth, enlightened by His rays divine,

   Brought forth the grass, the corn, and oil, and wine;

   Crowned with His goodness, let the people meet,

   And lay their thankful offerings at his feet;

   With grateful love that hand divine confessing,

   Which on each heart bestoweth every blessing.


   His mercy never ends; the dawn, the shade,

   Still see new beauties through new scenes displayed;

   Succeeding ages bless this sure abode,

   And children lean upon their fathers' God:

   The soul of man, through its immense duration,

   Drinks from this source immortal consolation.


   Burst into praise, my soul! all nature, join!

   Angels and men, in harmony combine!

   While human years are measured by the sun,

   And while eternity its course shall run,

   His goodness, in perpetual showers descending,

   Exalt in songs and raptures never-ending!

   Whose stars rejoice above;

   Whose anthems, the sublime accord

   Of storm and ocean-roar.


   Her song of gratitude is sung

   By Spring's awakening hours;

   Thine is the night, and the fair orbs that shine

   If round our path the thorns of sorrow grew,

   And mortal friends were faithless, Thou wast true

   Did sickness shake the frame, or anguish tear

   The wounded spirit, Thou wast present there.


   O, lend Thine ear, and lift our voice to Thee;

   Draw our frail hearts, and make them wholly Thine!

   Brother, thou art gone before us,

   And thy saintly soul is flown,

   Where tears are wiped from every eye,

   And sorrows are unknown;

   From the burden of the flesh,

   And from care and fear, released,

   Where the wicked cease from troubling,

   And the weary are at rest.


   Sin no more can taint thy spirit,

   Nor can doubt thy faith assail;

   Thy soul its welcome has received,

   Thy strength shall never fail;

   And thou'rt sure to meet the good,

   Whom on earth thou lovedst best,

   Where the wicked cease from troubling,

   And the weary are at rest.


   To the grave thy body bearing,

   Low we place it mid the dead;

   And lay the turf above it now,

   And seal its narrow bed;

   But thy spirit soars away,

   Free, among the faithful blest,

   Where the wicked cease from troubling

   And the weary are at rest.

   The changing of her sphere,

   To give to heaven a shining one,

   Who walked an angel here.


   Unto our Father's will alone

   One thought hath reconciled;

   That He whose love exceedeth ours

   Hath taken home his child.


   Fold her, O Father, in thine arms,

   And let her henceforth be

   A messenger of love between

   Our human hearts and Thee.

   Between us and the wrong,

   In death's embraces, ere he rose on high;

   And all the ransomed, by that narrow way,

   Pass to eternal life beyond the sky.

   Thou art gone to the grave;--but we will not deplore thee,

   Thou art gone to the grave: we no longer behold thee,

   But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee,

   And sinners may hope, since the Sinless hath died.


   Thou art gone to the grave; and, its mansion forsaking,

   Perchance thy tried spirit in doubt lingered long;

   But the sunshine of heaven beamed bright on thy waking,

   And the song that thou heard'st was the seraphim's song.


   Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee,

   Since God was thy refuge, thy guardian, thy guide;

   He gave thee, He took thee, and He will restore thee;

   And death has no sting, since the Saviour hath died.

   Finds the soul its heavenly birth.

   Angels wait the angel child,

   Gentle, young, and undefiled.


   Said not oft those pleading eyes

   That they longed for purer skies?

   Did not oft the falling tear

   Speak of roughening billows here?

   Prayed we not that she might rest

   On her Heavenly Father's breast?


   Give the spirit, then, to God,

   And its vesture to the sod;

   Life, henceforth, shall have a ray

   Kindled ne'er to pass away,

The House Our Fathers Built to God.


   We love the venerable house

   Our fathers built to God;

   In heaven are kept their grateful vows,

   Their dust endears the sod.


   Here holy thoughts a light have shed

   From many a radiant face,

   And prayers of tender hope have spread

   A perfume through the place.


   And anxious hearts have pondered here

   The mystery of life,

   And prayed the Eternal Spirit clear

   Their doubts and aid their strife.


   From humble tenements around

   Came up the pensive train,

   And in the church a blessing found,

   Which filled their homes again.


   For faith, and peace, and mighty love,

   That from the Godhead flow,

   Showed them the life of heaven above

   Springs from the life below.


   They live with God, their homes are dust;

   But here their children pray,

   And, in this fleeting lifetime, trust

   To find the narrow way.


   On him who by the altar stands,

   On him Thy blessing fall!

   Speak through his lips Thy pure commands,

   Thou Heart, that lovest all!

Epiphany.


   A wondrous star our pioneer,

   We left the mystic land

   Where heaven-nurtured childhood slept,

   Where yet old visions stand.


   O God! the land of dreams we left,

   Repose we left for aye,

   And followed meekly to the place

   Where our Redeemer lay.


   That humble manger we have found;

   The world his cradle is;

   His life is hidden far below

   Its sins and miseries.


   The world throws wide its brazen gates;

   With Thee we enter in;

   O, grant us, in our humble sphere,

   To free that world from sin.


   We have one mind in Christ our Lord

   To stand and point above;

   To hurl rebuke at social wrong;

   But all, O God, in love.


   The star is resting in the sky;

   To worship Christ we came;

   The moments haste; O, touch our tongues

   With Thy celestial flame!


   The truest worship is a life;

   All dreaming we resign;

   We lay our offerings at thy feet,--

   Our lives, O Christ, are thine!

   Thou Lord of Hosts, whose guiding hand

   Hast brought us here, before Thy face,

   Our spirits wait for Thy command,

   Our silent hearts implore Thy peace!


   Those spirits lay their noblest powers,

   As offerings, on Thy holy shrine;

   Thine was the strength that nourished ours;

   The children of the cross are Thine.


   While watching on our arms, at night,

   We saw Thine angels round us move:

   We heard Thy call, we felt Thy light,

   And followed, trusting to Thy love.


   And now, with hymn and prayer we stand,

   To give our strength to Thee, great God!

   We would redeem Thy holy land,

   That land which sin so long has trod.


   Send us where'er Thou wilt, O Lord,

   Through rugged toil and wearying fight;

   Thy conquering love shall be our sword,

   And faith in Christ our truest might.


   Send down Thy constant aid, we pray;

   Be Thy pure angels with us still;

   Thy truth, be that our firmest stay;

   Our only rest, to do Thy will.

Earth's Nameless Martyrs.


   The kings of old have shrine and tomb

   In many a minster's haughty gloom;

   And green, along the ocean-side,

   The mounds arise where heroes died;

   But show me on thy flowery breast,

   Earth! where thy nameless martyrs rest!


   The thousands that, uncheered by praise,

   Have made one offering of their days;

   For truth, for heaven, for freedom's sake,

   Resigned the bitter cup to take;

   And silently, in fearless faith,

   Have bowed their noble souls to death.


   O, haply all around lie strewed

   The ashes of that multitude!

   It may be that each day we tread

   Where thus devoted hearts have bled,

   And the sweet flowers the children sow

   Take root in holy dust below.


   What though no stone the record bears

   Of their deep thoughts and lonely prayers,

   May not our inmost hearts be stilled,

   With knowledge of their presence filled,

   And by their lives be taught to prize

   The meekness of self-sacrifice?

   Around us and abroad,

   Shall spring a plenteous seed

   Of witnesses for God.


   The Father hath received

   Their latest living breath;

   Yet vain is Satan's boast

   Of victory in their death;

   Still, still, though dead, they speak,

   And, trumpet-tongued, proclaim

   To many a wakening land

   The one prevailing name.

   When, in the power of cruel men,

   They poured their willing blood.


   God, whom we serve, our God, can save;

   Can damp the scorching flame,

   Can build an ark, or smooth the wave,

   For such as love His name.


   Yea, should it even to man appear,

   At times, as though the Lord

God With Us on the Deep.


   Heave, mighty ocean, heave!

   And blow, thou boisterous wind!

   Onward we swiftly glide, and leave

   Our home and friends behind.


   Away, away we steer,

   Upon the ocean's breast;

   And dim the distant heights appear,

   Like clouds along the west.


   There is a loneliness

   Upon the mighty deep;

   And hurried thoughts upon us press,

   As onward still we sweep.


   But there is hope and joy,

   Wherever we may be;

   Danger nor death can e'er destroy

   Our trust, O God, in Thee!


   Then wherefore should we grieve

   Or what have we to fear?

   Though home and friends and life we leave,

   Our God is ever near.


   Sweep, mighty ocean, sweep!

   Ye winds, blow foul or fair!

   Our God is with us on the deep,

   Our home is everywhere.

Anti-Slavery Hymn.


   Men! whose boast it is that ye

   Come of fathers brave and free,

   If there breathe on earth a slave,

   Are ye truly free and brave?

   If ye do not feel the chain,

   When it works a brother's pain,

   Are ye not base slaves indeed,

   Slaves unworthy to be freed?


   Is true freedom but to break

   Fetters for our own dear sake,

   And with leathern hearts forget

   That we owe mankind a debt?

   No! true freedom is to share

   All the chains our brothers wear,

   And with heart and hand to be

   Earnest to make others free.


   They are slaves, who fear to speak

   For the fallen and the weak;

   They are slaves, who will not choose

   Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,

   Rather than, in silence, shrink

   From the truth they needs must think;

   They are slaves, who dare not be

   In the right with two or three.

Teaching Little Children.


   O, say not, think not, heavenly notes

   To childish ears are vain,--

   That the young mind at random floats,

   And cannot reach the strain.


   Was not our Lord a little child,

   Taught by degrees to pray,

   By father dear and mother mild

   Instructed day by day?


   And loved he not of heaven to talk

   With children in his sight,

   To meet them in his daily walk,

   And to his arms invite?


   And though some tones be weak and low,

   What are all prayers beneath,

   But cries of babes, that cannot know

   Half the deep thought they breathe?


   In his own words we Christ adore;

   But angels, as we speak,

   Higher above our meaning soar

   Than we o'er children weak.


   And yet his words mean more than they,

   And yet he owns their praise;

   Our country is Immanuel's ground;

   The songs of Zion cheer our hearts,

   While strangers here we toil.


   Oft do our eyes with joy o'erflow,

   And oft are bathed in tears;

   But only heaven our hopes can raise,

   And sin alone, our fears.


   We tread the path our Master trod;

   We bear the cross he bore;

   And every thorn that wounds our feet

   His temples pierced before.


   The flowers that spring along the road

   We scarcely stoop to pluck;

   We walk o'er beds of shining ore,

   Nor waste one wishful look.


   We purge our mortal dross away,

   And while we die to earth and sense,

   Our heaven is here begun.

The Garden of Gethsemane.


   Jesus, while he dwelt below,

   As divine historians say,

   To a place would often go,

   Near to Kedron's brook that lay:

   In this place he loved to be,

   And 'twas named Gethsemane.


   'Twas a garden, as we read,

   At the foot of Olivet,

   Low and proper to be made

   The Redeemer's lone retreat:

   When from noise he would be free,

   Then he sought Gethsemane.


   Thither, by their Master brought,

   His disciples likewise came;

   There the heavenly truths he taught

   Often set their hearts on flame:

   Therefore they, as well as he,

   Visited Gethsemane.


   Oft conversing here they sat;

   Or might join with Christ in prayer;

   O, what blest devotion that,

   When the Lord himself is there!

   All things there did so agree

   To endear Gethsemane.


   Full of love to man's lost race,

   On the conflict much he thought;

   This he knew the destined place,

   And he loved the sacred spot:

   Therefore Jesus chose to be

   Often in Gethsemane.

Law and Love.


   Not to the terrors of the Lord,

   The tempest, fire, and smoke;

   Not to the thunder of that word

   Which God on Sinai spoke;--


   But we are come to Zion's hill,

   The city of our God,

   Where milder words declare His will,

   And spread His love abroad.


   Behold the great, the glorious host

   Of angels, clothed in light!

   Behold the spirits of the just,

   Whose faith is turned to sight!


   In such society as this,

   My weary soul would rest;

   For he who dwells where Jesus is

   Must be forever blest.

Prayer and Labor.


   By earth hemmed in, by earth oppressed,

   'Tis hard to labor,--hard to pray;

   And of the week, for prayer and rest,

   We've but one Sabbath day.


   But purer spirits walk above,

   Who worship alway; who are blest

   With an upspringing might of love

   That makes all labor, rest.


   Father, while here, we would arise

   In spirit to that realm; and there

   Be every act a sacrifice,

   And every thought a prayer!

Strength From Struggle.


   Grows dark thy path before thee?

   Press on! still undismayed;

   Heaven shines resplendent o'er thee,

   Though earth be wrapped in shade.


   And God, thy trust, hath given,

   With word from swerving free,

   The angels of high heaven

   A charge concerning thee.


   Then though thy feet may falter

   Even at early morn,

   And from hope's burning altar

   The light may be withdrawn,--


   Yet from thy self-prostration

   Thou shalt awake in power;

   From tears and lamentation,

   To conquest every hour.


   Strong in thy perfect weakness,

   Thy strength shall never fail;

   Mighty in holy meekness,

   Thine arm shall still prevail.

   When thirst for power or for gold

   Hath led our souls astray;

   When, blind, by blinder guides we're told,

   "Lo, here thou'lt find the way;"


   Look down, O Father, from above;

   Set us from error free;

   Teach us to serve Thee here in love,

   And find our home in Thee.


   When faith Thy guidance humbly takes,

   And seeks Thy will to do,

   Clear light upon our pathway breaks,

   The world to guide us through.


   Thy spirit send, our souls to keep;

   Thy wisdom make our own;

   And though our way leads through the deep,

   We wander not alone.

Light For All.


   The light pours down from heaven,

   And enters where it may;

   The eyes of all earth's children

   Are cheered with one bright day.


   So let the mind's true sunshine

   Be spread o'er earth as free,

   And fill men's waiting spirits,

   As the waters fill the sea.


   The soul can shed a glory

   On every work well done;

   As even things most lowly

   Are radiant in the sun.


   Then let each human spirit

   Enjoy the vision bright;

   The truth which comes from heaven

   Shall spread like heaven's own light;


   Till earth becomes God's temple;

   And every human heart

   Shall join in one great service,

   Each happy in his part.

   And timely lore impart,

   To make our latest shadows fall

   From sunshine in the heart.


   Yes, even so; the summer leaf,

   The summer flowers, declare

   Their childlike, chastening belief,

   Thy children from being distressed:

   O, how in their weakness shall children repay

   Thy fatherly kindness, by night and by day?

   And lift us earth's trials above!

   The heart's true affection is all we can give;

   In love's pure devotion, O, help us to live!


   So long as Thou seest it right

   That here upon earth we should stay,

   We pray Thee to guard us by night,

   And help us to serve Thee by day;

   And when all the days of this life shall be o'er,

   Receive us in heaven, to serve Thee the more.

   Sweet is the light of Sabbath eve,

   And soft the sunbeam lingering there;

   Those sacred hours this low earth leave,

   Wafted on wings of praise and prayer.

   Peace shines and smiles on all below;

   The plain, the stream, the wood, the hill,

   All fair with evening's setting glow!


   Season of rest! the tranquil soul

   Feels thy sweet calm, and melts in love;

   And while these sacred moments roll,

   Faith sees a smiling heaven above.


   Thou God of mercy, swift to hear,

   More swift than man to tell his need;

   Be Thou to us, this evening, near,

   And to Thy fount our spirits lead!

   Scarce known, save by its fountain-head--

   Now onward pours, a mighty flood,

   And fills the new-formed world with good.


   Where'er that living fountain flows,

   New life its healing wave bestows,

   And man, from sin's corruptions free,

   Inspires with its own purity.


   A spirit, breathed from Zion's hill,

   Are in that holy strain;

   And hope and love and trust are there,

   And triumph, won through pain.

   Breathes sweetness out of woe.


   When joy no longer soothes or cheers,

   And e'en the hope that threw

   A moment's sparkle o'er our tears

   Is dimmed and vanished too;


   O, who would bear life's stormy doom,

   Did not Thy wing of love

   Come, brightly wafting through the gloom

   Our peace-branch from above?


   Then sorrow, touched by Thee, grows bright,

   With more than rapture's ray;

   But where it lights, the favored place

   By richest fruits is known.

   May I be nerved to labors high and pure,

   And Thou Thy child to do Thy work employ.


   In One who walked on earth, a man of woe,

   Was holier peace than even this hour inspires;

   From him to me let inward quiet flow,

   And give the might my failing will requires.

The Pilgrim Fathers.


   The breaking waves dashed high

   On a stern and rock-bound coast,

   And the woods against a stormy sky

   Their giant branches tossed,

   And the heavy night hung dark,

   The hills and waters o'er,

   When a band of exiles moored their bark

   On the wild New England shore.


   Not as the conqueror comes,

   They, the true-hearted, came;

   Not with the roll of the stirring drums,

   And the trumpet that sings of fame.

   Not as the flying come,

   In silence and in fear;

   They shook the depths of the desert's gloom

   With their hymns of lofty cheer.


   Amidst the storm they sang;

   And the stars heard, and the sea!

   And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang

   To the anthem of the free.

   The ocean eagle soared

   From his nest by the white wave's foam,

   And the rocking pines of the forest roared,--

   This was their welcome home!


   What sought they thus afar?

   Bright jewels of the mine?

   The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?

   They sought a faith's pure shrine!

   Ay, call it holy ground,

   The soil where first they trod!

   They have left unstained, what there they found:

   Freedom to worship God.

   He giveth His beloved sleep.


   His dews drop mutely on the hill,

   His cloud above it saileth still,

   Though on its slope men toil and reap;

   More softly than the dew is shed,

   Or cloud is floated overhead,

   He giveth His beloved sleep.

The Gate of Heaven.


   Our Father God! not face to face

   May mortal sense commune with Thee,

   Nor lift the curtains of that place

   Where dwells Thy secret Majesty.

   Yet whereso'er our spirits bend

   In rev'rent faith and humble prayer,

   Thy promised blessing will descend,

   And we shall find Thy spirit there.


   Lord! be the spot where now we meet

   An open gateway into heaven;

   Here may we sit at Jesus' feet,

   And feel our deepest sins forgiven.

   Here may desponding care look up;

   And sorrow lay its burden down,

   Or learn, of him, to drink the cup,

   To bear the cross, and win the crown.


   Here may the sick and wandering soul

   To truth still blind, to sin a slave,

   Find better than Bethesda's pool,

   Or than Siloam's healing wave.

   And may we learn, while here apart

   From the world's passion and its strife;

   That Thy true shrine's a loving heart,

   And Thy best praise a holy life!

O Father! Hear.


   Hear, Father, hear our prayer!

   Thou who art pity where sorrow prevaileth,

   Thou who art safety when mortal help faileth,

   Strength to the feeble and hope to despair,

   Hear, Father, hear our prayer!


   Hear, Father, hear our prayer!

   Wandering alone in the land of the stranger,

   Be with all travellers in sickness or danger,

   Guard Thou their path, guide their feet from the snare:

   Hear, Father, hear our prayer!


   Hear Thou the poor that cry!

   Feed Thou the hungry and lighten their sorrow,

   Grant them the sunshine of hope for the morrow;

   They are Thy children, their trust is on high:

   Hear Thou the poor that cry!


   Dry Thou the mourner's tear!

   Heal Thou the wounds of time-hallowed affection;

   Grant to the widow and orphan protection;

   Be in their trouble a friend ever near;

   Dry Thou the mourner's tear!


   Hear, Father, hear our prayer!

   Long hath Thy goodness our footsteps attended;

   Be with the pilgrim whose journey is ended:

   When at Thy summons for death we prepare,

   Hear, Father, hear our prayer!

Prayer of a Lowly Spirit.


   From the recesses of a lowly spirit,

   Our humble prayer ascends; O Father! hear it,

   Upsoaring on the wings of awe and meekness;

   Forgive its weakness!


   We see Thy hand; it leads us, it supports us:

   We hear Thy voice; it counsels and it courts us:

   And then we turn away; and still Thy kindness

   Forgives our blindness.


   O how long-suffering, Lord! but Thou delightest

   To win with love the wandering; Thou invitest,

   By smiles of mercy, not by frowns or terrors,

   Man from his errors.


   Father and Saviour! plant within each bosom

   The seeds of holiness; and bid them blossom

   In fragrance and in beauty bright and vernal,

   And spring eternal.


   Then place them in Thine everlasting gardens,

   Where angels walk, and seraphs are the wardens;

   Where every flower escaped through death's dark portal,

   Becomes immortal.

   That walks at noontide hour,

   The midnight arrow's secret flight,

   O'er us have had no power:

   But smiles from loving eyes

   Have been around our way,

   And lips on which a blessing lies

   Have bidden us to pray.


   O, blessed is the hour

   That lifts our hearts on high!

   Like sunlight when the tempests lower,

   Father divine, our wants relieve

   In this our evil day;

   To all Thy tempted children give

   The power to watch and pray.


   Long as our fiery trials last,

   Long as the cross we bear,

   O, let our souls on Thee be cast,

   In never-ceasing prayer!


   Thy spirit of untroubled peace

   Give us in faith to claim,

   To wrestle till we see Thy face,

   And know Thy hidden name.


   Till Thou Thy perfect love impart,

   Till Thou Thyself bestow,

   Be this the cry of every heart,--

   I will not let Thee go;


   I will not let Thee go, unless

   Thou tell Thy name to me;

   With all Thy great salvation bless,

   And make me all like Thee.


   Then let us, on the mountain top,

   Behold Thine unveiled face,

   Where faith in sight is swallowed up,

   And prayer in endless praise.

Longing for Rest in God.


   O almighty God of love!

   Thy holy arm display;

   Send us succor from above,

   Against the evil day;

   Arm our weakness with Thy power;

   Put Thy strength our hearts within;

   Be our stronghold and our tower

   Against the assaults of sin.


   Could we of Thy strength take hold,

   And always feel Thee near,

   Confident, divinely bold,

   Our souls would know no fear.

   Nothing could their firmness shock;

   Though the gates of hell assail,

   Were we built upon the rock

   They never could prevail.


   Thou would'st, in the trying hour,

   A sure protection be,

   Guard us from temptation's power,

   And fix our souls on Thee.

   Lord, on Thee our trust is placed;

   Never thence may we remove;

   In the arms of love embraced,

   Thine everlasting love.

Why Art Thou Cast Down, My Soul?


   We pray for truth and peace;

   With weary hearts we ask

   Some rest in which our souls may cease

   From life's perplexing task.

   We weep--yet none is found;

   We weep--yet hope grows faint;--

   And deeper in its mournful sound

   Goes up our wild complaint.


   Only to living faith

   The promises are shown;

   And by the love that passes death

   The rest is won alone.

   Be ours the earnest heart,

   Be ours the steady will,

   To work in silent trust our part;

   For God is working still.


   Then newer lights shall rise

   Above these clouds of sin,

   And heaven's unfolding mysteries

   To glad our souls begin.

   Our hearts from fear and wrong

   Shall win their full release,

   With God's own might forever strong,

   And calm with God's own peace.

   Which cannot ask in vain;

   Which will not let the angel go

   Until the prayer it gain.


   On me the faith divine bestow

   Which doth the mountain move;

   And all my spotless life shall show

   The omnipotence of love.


   And, Father, when I doubt that I

   Can live, and sin no more;

   Then if on Thee I dare rely,

   The faith shall bring the power.

   I should live to Thee alone;

   Year by year, Thy hand hath brought me

   When I doubted, sent me light;

   Through the prayer of faith receiving

   Strength,--the spirit's strength indeed.

   Wholly rest upon Thine arm,

   Follow wholly Thy directing,

   Thou mine only guard from harm!

   Keep me from mine own undoing,

   Help me turn to Thee when tried,

The Patient Waiting upon God.


   Wait on the Lord, ye heirs of hope,

   And let His word support your souls;

   Well can He bear your courage up,

   And all your foes and fears control.


   He waits His own well-chosen hour

   The intended mercy to display;

   And His paternal pities move,

   While wisdom dictates the delay.


   Blest are the humble souls that wait

   With sweet submission to His will;

   Harmonious all their passions move,

   And in the midst of storms are still;--


   Still, till their Father's well-known voice

   Wakens their silence into songs;

   Then earth grows vocal with His praise,

   And heaven the grateful shout prolongs.

   The thorniest way is lying still behind us,

   We shall be braver for the past despair.

Evening Hymn.


   On the dewy breath of even

   Thousand odors mingling rise,

   Borne like incense up to heaven,--

   Nature's evening sacrifice.


   With her fragrant offerings blending,

   Let our glad thanksgivings be

   To Thy throne, O Lord, ascending,--

   Incense of our hearts to Thee.


   Thou, whose favors without number

   All our days with gladness bless,

   Let Thine eye, that knows no slumber,

   Guard our hours of helplessness.


   Then, though conscious we are sleeping

   In the outer courts of death,

   Safe beneath a Father's keeping,

   Calm we rest in perfect faith.

Night.


   While the stars unnumbered roll

   Round the ever-constant pole,

   Far above these spangled skies

   All my thoughts to God shall rise.


   From on high He shall impart

   Secret comfort to my heart;

   He in these serenest hours

   Guide my spiritual powers.


   He His spirit doth diffuse,

   Sweeter far than midnight dews;

   Lifting all my thoughts above,

   On the wings of faith and love.


   What if death my sleep invade;--

   Should I be of death afraid?

   Whilst encircled by Thine arm,

   Death may strike, but cannot harm.


   Visions brighter than the morn

   Greet the deathless spirit born;

   See, the guardian angel nigh

   Waits to waft my soul on high!


   With Thy heavenly presence blest,

   Death is life, and labor, rest;

   Welcome sleep or death to me,

   Still secure, for still with Thee!

   Be near us, O Father! through night's silent hour;

   Impart to our slumbers Thy calmness divine;

   Drop rest on our lids like the dew on the flower,

   That even our still sleep may have something of Thine.


   O watch o'er our couch; drive the tempter away;

   From the sins that corrupt and betray keep us free;

   That nor fancy shall wander, nor passion shall stray,

   And we dream not a thought that's displeasing to Thee.


   And grant, when deep sleep o'er our senses shall close,

   That the heart may still watch, all unclouded and clear;

   Guard, guard still Thy children; and bless the repose

   That, stainless of sin, is untouched by a fear.


   Then still to Thee, Father, our praises we pay;

   Still to Thee we will offer love's infinite store;

   Send down Thy pure spirit, even now while we pray;

   Be with us, and keep us, and bless, evermore!

Our Guard By Night.


   Lord of the world, who hast preserved

   Us safely through this day,

   Now guard us in the silent night,

   And in all time, we pray!


   Be present, in Thy peace, to those

   Who as Thy suppliants wait;

   Blot out the record of our sin;

   Our gloom illuminate!


   Let not, amid our hours of sleep,

   Life's enemy steal in;

   Let not a vision of the night

   Have power to whisper sin.


   Guard every avenue from guile,

   When slumber seals our eyes;

   And guiltless as we laid us down,

   So guiltless let us rise.

Hymn of Night.


   Creator of all! through whose all-seeing might

   This ponderous globe to its hour is true,

   Thou glad'st us each morn with the vision of light,

   And at eve on our lids pourest slumber like dew.


   The toils of the day are now brought to their end,

   And night is preparing her balm for our eyes;

   Our strength, Lord, encourage, our weakness defend;

   Hear our prayers as they spring, and our hymns as they rise!


   We beseech of Thee now, when dim night over all

   Is enfolding her shroud and resuming her sway,

   That Thy grace still may shine, 'mid the glooms that appal,

   As a star to our eyes, and a lamp to our way.


   Though our bodies may sleep, let our souls be awake,

   Keep them free from the deadness that guilt only knows;

   Be the dream of the night pure as day, for Thy sake,

   And the calm of Thy paradise on our repose!


   From all stain of crime let our bosoms be free,

   And still rest on our God, unpolluted and clear;

   So the tempter shall flee; nor our slumbers endure

   One pang of remorse or one shudder of fear.

   Well pleased to list, at such a time,

   The wakeful heart, in praise sublime.


   Still watch and pray and raise the hymn,

   Throughout the hours of darkness dim!

   God will not spurn the humblest guest,

   But give us of His holy rest.


   Glory to God, who is in heaven!

   Praise to His blessed Son be given!

   With grief and shame weighed down,

   We cast behind fear, sin and death;

   With thee we seek the things above;

   Our inmost souls thy spirit breathe,

   Of power, of calmness, and of love.


   The power, 'mid worldliness and sin,

   To do, in all, our Father's will;

   Like thee, the victory to win,

   And bid each tempting voice be still.


   The calmness perfect faith inspires,

   Which waiteth patiently and long;

   The love which faileth not, nor tires,

   Thus through thy quickening spirit, Lord,

   Thy perfect life in us reveal,

   And help us, as we live to God,

   Still more and more with man to feel.

   Father of mercies! God of peace!

   Being whose bounties never cease!

   While to the heavens, in grateful tones,

   Ascend our mingled orisons,

   Listen to these, the notes of praise,

   Which we, a happy people, raise!


   Our hamlets, sheltered by Thy care,

   Abodes of peace and plenty are;

   Our tillage by Thy blessing yields

   An hundred fold from ripened fields:

   And flowing grain, and burthened vine,

   Are tokens of Thy Love divine.


   The cradled head of infancy

   Doth owe its tranquil rest to Thee;

   Youth's doubting step, man's firmer tread,

   In years mature, by Thee are led;

   Secure may trembling age, oh Lord!

   Lean on its staff, Thy holy Word.


   Teach us these blessings to improve,

   Teach us to serve Thee, teach to love;

   Exalt our hearts, that we may see

   The Giver of all good in Thee;

   And be Thy word our daily food,

   Thy service, Lord, our greatest good.

   When in silence, o'er the deep,

   Darkness kept its deathlike sleep,

   Soon as God His mandate spoke,

   Light in wondrous beauty broke.


   But a beam of holier light

   Gilded Bethlehem's lonely night,

   When the glory of the Lord,

   Mercy's sunlight, shone abroad.


   "Peace on earth, good-will to men."

   Burst the glorious anthem then;

   Angels, bending from above,

   Joined that strain of holy love.


   Floating o'er the waves of time,

   Comes to us that song sublime,

   Bearing to the pilgrim's ear

   Words to soothe, sustain, and cheer.


   For creation's blessed light,

   Praise to Thee, Thou God of might!

   Seraph-strains Thy name should bless

   For the Sun of Righteousness!

   Christ to the young man said: "Yet one thing more,

   Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor,

   And come and follow me!"


   Within this temple, Christ again, unseen,

   Those sacred words has said;

   And his invisible hands to-day have been

   Laid on a young man's head.


   And evermore beside him on his way,

   The unseen Christ shall move,

   That he may lean upon his arm and say,

   "Dost thou, dear Lord, approve?"


   Beside him at the marriage feast shall be,

   To make the scene more fair;

   Beside him in the dark Gethsemane

   Of pain and midnight prayer.


   O holy trust! O endless sense of rest!

   O'er the ocean's breast doth play,

   Though no throngs assemble there,

   No sweet church-bell warns to prayer,

   Sabbath to the unresting sea.


   When the raging billows dark

   Thunder round the storm-tossed bark,

   Thou who on the whelming wave

   Didst the loved disciples save,

   Thou canst hear them when they pray,--

   We own Thy way is in the sea,

   O'erawed by majesty divine,

   Infinite God, Thy greatness spanned

   These heavens, and meted out the skies;

   Lo! in the hollow of Thy hand

For a Charitable Occasion.


   When long the soul had slept in chains

   And man to man was stern and cold;

   When love and worship were but strains

   That swept the gifted chords of old--

   By shady mount and peaceful lake,

   A meek and lowly stranger came,

   The weary drank the words he spake,

   The poor and suffering blessed his name.


   He went where frenzy held its rule,

   Where sickness breathed its spell of pain;

   By famed Bethesda's mystic pool,

   And by the darkened gate of Nain.

   He soothed the mourner's troubled breast,

   He raised the contrite sinner's head,

   And on the loved ones' lowly rest

   The light of better life he shed.


   Father, the spirit Jesus knew

   We humbly ask of Thee to-night,

   That we may be disciples too

   Of him whose way was love and light.

   Bright be the places where we tread

   Amid earth's suffering and its poor,

   Until that day when tears are shed,

   And broken sighs are heard, no more.

True Worship and Undefiled.


   O, he whom Jesus loved has truly spoken!

   And feeds the widow and the fatherless.


   Then, brother man, fold to thy heart thy brother!

   For where love dwells, the peace of God is there;

   To worship rightly is to love each other;

   Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.

   Of him whose holy work was doing good:

   So shall the wide earth seem our Father's temple,

   Each loving life a psalm of gratitude.

   God's angels! not only on high do they sing,

   And soar through our skies with invisible wing;

   But here, on the earth, where in wretchedness lie

   Its sin-stricken children to struggle and die.


   They come, in their mercy and power, to dispel

   The spectres of gloom from the prisoner's cell;

   In love's name to say to the stricken one there,

   That God still hath ear, and an answer to prayer.


   And strong grows the heart of the outcast--and soon

   In that dim prison come the pure light-gleams of noon;

   The resolve and the faith of the sinner forgiven,

   Send him back to the world with a heart seeking heaven.


   God's angels! Love speed them o'er earth's wide domain!

   New aids to impart, and new triumphs to gain;

   Till the wrathful and wrong from our world shall retire,

   And humanity's groans in her praises expire.


   For the promise of truth--though the doubting deny--

   Is, that love shall prevail in the earth as on high;

   Its life-waters healing, wherever they flow,

   Of that thrice happy whole;

   Derive its pulse from Thee the heart,

   Its life from Thee the soul.

Peace Everywhere.


   Nature hath seasons of repose;

   Her slumbering clouds and quiet sky;

   And many a bright-faced stream that flows

   Forever noiselessly.


   The stormy winds are hushed to rest,

   And hang self-poised upon their wings;

   And nursed on mother nature's breast,

   Flowers lie like sleeping things.


   The ocean, that in mountains ran,

   Spreads boundlessly without a wave;

   And is it only said of man,

   His peace is in the grave?


   Oh! for the coming of the end,

   The last long Sabbath-day of time,

   When peace from heaven shall descend,

   Like light, on every clime.


   For men in ships far off at sea

   Shall hear the happy nations raise

   The song of peace and liberty,

   And overflowing praise.


   Mankind shall be one brotherhood;

   One human soul shall fill the earth,

   And God shall say, "The world is good

   As when I gave it birth."

The Kingdom of God.


   O Spirit of the living God,

   In all Thy plenitude of grace,

   Where'er the foot of man hath trod,

   Descend on our benighted race!


   Be darkness, at Thy coming, light;

   Confusion, order, in Thy path;

   Souls without strength inspire with might;

   Bid mercy triumph over wrath.


   O spirit of the Lord! prepare

   All the round earth her God to meet;

   Breathe Thou abroad like morning air,

   Till hearts of stone begin to beat.


   Baptize the nations; far and nigh

   The triumphs of the cross record;

   Thy name, O Father, glorify,

   Till every people call Thee Lord.

The Church Everlasting.


   O where are kings and empires now

   Of old that went and came?

   But Holy Church is praying yet,

   A thousand years the same.

   Mark ye her holy battlements,

   And her foundations strong;

   And hear within, her solemn voice,

   And her unending song.


   For not like kingdoms of the world

   The Holy Church of God!

   Though earthquake shocks are rocking her,

   And tempests are abroad;

   Unshaken as eternal hills,

   Unmovable she stands,--

   A mountain that shall fill the earth,

   A fane unbuilt by hands.

The Day-Spring From on High.


   Thy servants in the temple watched

   The dawning of the day,

   Impatient with its earliest beams

   Their holy vows to pay;

   And chosen saints far off beheld

   That great and glorious morn,

   When the glad day-spring from on high

   Auspiciously should dawn.


   On us the Sun of Righteousness

   Its brightest beams hath poured;

   With grateful hearts and holy zeal,

   Lord, be Thy love adored;

   And let us look with joyful hope

   To that more glorious day,

   Before whose brightness sin and death,

   And grief, shall flee away.

The Pilgrim's Hymn.


   Now let our voices join,

   To form one pleasant song:

   Ye pilgrims in God's holy way,

   With music pass along!


   How straight the path appears,

   How open and how fair!

   No lurking snares to entrap our feet,

   No fierce destroyer there!


   But flowers of paradise

   In rich profusion spring;

   The sun of hope shines on our path,

   And dear companions sing.


   All glory to His name,

   Who drew the shining trace;

   To Him who leads the wanderers on,

   And cheers them with His grace.


   Subdue the nations, Lord!

   Teach all their kings Thy ways;

   That earth's full choir the notes may swell,

   And heaven resound the praise.

The Angel of the Lord.


   Onward speed thy conquering flight,

   Angel, onward speed!

   Cast abroad thy radiant light,

   Bid the shades recede;

   Tread the idols in the dust,

   Heathen fanes destroy,

   Spread the gospel's love and trust,

   Spread the gospel's joy.


   Onward speed thy conquering flight,

   Angel, onward fly!

   Long has been the reign of night,

   Bring the morning nigh.

   Unto thee earth's sufferers lift

   Their imploring wail;

   Bear them heaven's holy gift

   Ere their courage fail.


   Onward speed thy conquering flight,

   Angel, onward speed!

   Morning bursts upon our sight,

   Lo, the time decreed!

   Now the Lord His kingdom takes,

   Thrones and empires fall,

   And the joyous song awakes,

   God is all in all.

The Reformer's Vow.


   God of the earnest heart,

   The trust assured and still,

   Thou who our strength forever art,--

   We come to do Thy will!


   Upon that painful road

   By saints serenely trod,

   Whereon their hallowing influence flowed,

   Would we go forth, O God!


   'Gainst doubt and shame and fear

   In human hearts to strive,

   That all may learn to love and bear,

   To conquer self, and live;


   To draw Thy blessing down,

   And bring the wronged redress,

   And give this glorious world its crown,

   The spirit's Godlikeness.


   No dreams from toil to charm,

   No trembling on the tongue;--

   Lord, in Thy rest may we be calm,

   Through Thy completeness, strong!


   Thou hearest while we pray;

   O deep within us write,

   With kindling power, our God, to-day,

   Thy word,--"On earth be light!"

Be Strong, Fear Not.


   Prisoners of hope! be strong, be bold;

   Cast off your doubts, disdain to fear!

   The day which prophets have foretold,

   And saints have longed for, draweth near:

   Our God shall in His kingdom come;

   Prepare your hearts to make Him room!


   O ye of fearful hearts, be strong!

   Your downcast eyes and hands lift up;

   Doubt not, nor cry "O God, how long?"

   Hope to the end, in patience hope!

   O never from your faith remove;

   Ye cannot fail, for God is love!


   Lord, we have faith; we wait the hour

   Which to the earth Thy kingdom brings;

   When Thou, in love, and joy, and power,

   Shalt come and make us priests and kings:

   When man shall be indeed Thy son,

   And Thy pure will on earth be done.

He Maketh All Things New.


   Almighty Spirit, now behold

   A world by sin destroyed!

   Creative spirit, as of old

   Move on the formless void!


   Give Thou the word--the healing sound

   Shall quell the deadly strife,

   And earth again, like Eden crowned,

   Bring forth the tree of life.


   If sang the morning stars for joy

   When nature rose to view,

   What strains shall angel harps employ,

   When Thou shalt all renew!

The Morning.


   We wait in faith, in prayer we wait,

   Until the happy hour

   When God shall ope the morning gate,

   By His almighty power.


   We wait in faith, and turn our face

   To where the day-light springs;

   Till He shall come earth's gloom to chase,

   With healing on His wings.


   And even now, amid the gray,

   The East is brightening fast,

   And kindling to that perfect day

   Which never shall be past.


   We wait in faith, we wait in prayer,

   Till that blest day shall shine,

   When earth shall fruits of Eden bear,

   And all, O God, be Thine!


   O, guide us till our night is done!

   Until, from shore to shore,

   Thou, Lord, our everlasting sun,

   Art shining evermore!

Lo! He Cometh.


   God comes, with succor speedy,

   To those who suffer wrong;

   To help the poor and needy,

   And bid the weak be strong;

   He comes to break oppression,

   And set the captive free,

   To take away transgression,

   And rule in equity.


   He shall come down, as showers

   Upon the thirsty earth;

   And joy and hope, like flowers,

   Spring in His path to birth.

   Before Him, on the mountains,

   Shall Peace, the herald, go,

   And Righteousness, in fountains,

   From hill to valley flow.


   To Him shall prayer unceasing,

   And daily vows, ascend;

   His kingdom still increasing,

   A kingdom without end.

   The tide of time shall never

   His covenant remove;

   His name shall stand forever;

   His great, best name of Love.

The Holy Way.


   Sing, ye redeemed of the Lord,

   Your great deliverer sing;

   Pilgrims, for Zion's city bound,

   Be joyful in your King.


   See the fair way His hand hath raised,

   How holy and how plain!

   Nor shall the simplest travellers err,

   Nor ask the trace in vain.


   No ravening lion shall destroy,

   Nor lurking serpent wound;

   Pleasure and safety, peace and praise,

   Through all the path are found.


   A hand divine shall lead you on

   Through all the blissful road,

   Till to the sacred mount you rise,

   And see your smiling God.


   There, garlands of immortal joy

   Shall bloom on every head;

   While sorrow, sighing, and distress,

   Like shadows all are fled.

The Prophet's Vision.


   Faint the earth, and parched with drought,

   Make the waters, Lord, gush out!

   Streams of love our thirst to bless,

   Starting in the wilderness.

   Long we wait Thy peace to know:

   Father, bid the waters flow,

   Make the thirsty land a pool,

   Make man's suffering spirit whole.


   Hark! the wastes have found a voice;

   Loneliest deserts now rejoice,

   When the Lord His presence shows,

   Lo, they blossom like the rose;

   See! this barren earth of ours

   Buds and puts forth fruits and flowers,

   Flowers of Eden, fruits of peace,

   Love and Joy and Righteousness!

Thy Will Be Done on Earth as in Heaven.


   Spirit of peace and love and power,

   Fountain of life and light below,

   Abroad Thy healing influence shower,

   O'er all the nations let it flow.

   Inspire our hearts with perfect love;

   In all the work of faith fulfil;

   So not heaven's host shall swifter move,

   Than we on earth, to do Thy will.


   Father, 'tis Thine each day to yield

   Thy children's wants a fresh supply;

   Thou clothest the lilies of the field,

   And hearest the young ravens cry.

   To Thee we pray; for all must live

   By Thee, who knowest their every need--

   Pray for the world, that Thou wilt give

   All human hearts Thy living bread.


   In faith we wait and long and pray,

   To see that time, by prophets told,

   When nations, new-born into day,

   Shall be ingathered to Thy fold.

   We cannot doubt Thy gracious will,

   Thou mighty, merciful and just!

   And Thou wilt speedily fulfil

   The word in which Thy servants trust.

Brightening Unto the Perfect Day.


   Gone is the hollow, murky night,

   With all its shadows dun;

   O shine upon us, heavenly light,

   As on the earth the sun!


   Pour on our hearts Thy heavenly beam,

   In radiance sublime!

   Retire before that ray supreme,

   Ye sins of elder time!


   Lo, on the morn that now is here

   No night shall ever fall;

   But faith shall burn, undimmed and clear,

   Till God be all in all.


   This is the dawn of infant faith;

   The day will follow soon,

   When hope shall breathe with freer breath,

   And morn be lost in noon;


   For to the seed that's sown to-day

   A harvest time is given,

   When charity with faith to stay,

   Shall make on earth a heaven.
