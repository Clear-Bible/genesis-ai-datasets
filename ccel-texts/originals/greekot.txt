  PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

   WHEN some two years ago it became clear that a reprint of this
   Introduction would shortly be required, the Syndics of the Press at my
   request put the revision, which I was unable to undertake, into the
   hands of a scholar already known to students of the Greek Old Testament
   by his Book of Isaiah according to the Septuagint. Mr Ottley, while
   leaving intact the form and even the pagination of the Introduction,
   has made every endeavour to bring the contents up to the present state
   of knowledge. This has been done partly by a careful revision of the
   text and the occasional rewriting of a paragraph, partly by writing new
   footnotes and a large number of valuable additional notes, and by
   expanding the bibliographical lists that follow each chapter, which
   after the lapse of so many years were necessarily defective.

   I cannot sufficiently express my gratitude to Mr Ottley for the
   unremitting labour which he has expended on my book, and I am confident
   that future readers will share my sense of obligation. I venture to
   hope that, thus revised, the Introduction may continue for some years
   to be of service to those who are entering on the study of the Greek
   Old Testament.

  PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

   THIS book is an endeavour to supply a want which has been felt by many
   readers of the Greek Old Testament. The literature of the subject is
   enormous, and its chief points have been compendiously treated in
   Biblical Dictionaries and similar publications. But hitherto no manual
   has placed within the student's reach all the information which he
   requires in the way of general introduction to the Greek versions.

   A first attempt is necessarily beset with uncertainties. Experience
   only can shew whether the help here provided is precisely such as the
   student needs, and whether the right proportion has been preserved in
   dealing with the successive divisions of the subject. But it is hoped
   that the present work may, at least meet the immediate wants of those
   who use The Old Testament in Greek, and serve as a forerunner to larger
   and more adequate treatises upon the same subject.

   Such as it is, this volume owes more than I can say to the kindness of
   friends, among whom may especially be mentioned Principal Bebb, of St
   David's College, Lampeter, and Grinfield Lecturer at Oxford; Mr Brooke
   and Mr McLean, editors of the Larger Cambridge Septuagint; Mr Forbes
   Robinson, and Dr W. E. Barnes. But my acknowledgements are principally
   due to Professor Eberhard Nestle, of Maulbronn, who has added to the
   obligations under which he had previously laid me by reading the whole
   of this Introduction in proof, and suggesting many corrections and
   additions. While Dr Nestle is not to be held responsible for the final
   form in which the book appears, the reader will owe to him in great
   measure such freedom from error or fulness in the minuter details as it
   may possess. Mr Thackeray's work in the Appendix speaks for itself.
   Both the prolegomena to Aristeas and the text of the letter are wholly
   due to his generous labours, and they will form a welcome gift to
   students of the Septuagint and of Hellenistic Greek.

   Free use has been made of all published works dealing with the various
   branches of learning which fall within the range of the subject. While
   direct quotations have been acknowledged where they occur, it has not
   been thought desirable to load the margin with references to all the
   sources from which information has been obtained. But the student will
   generally be able to discover these for himself from the bibliography
   which is appended to almost every chapter.

   In dismissing my work I desire to tender my sincere thanks to the
   readers and workmen of the Cambridge University Press, whose
   unremitting attention has brought the production of the book to a
   successful end.

    THE HISTORY OF THE GREEK OLD TESTAMENT

    AND OF ITS TRANSMISSION.







PART I.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    THE ALEXANDRIAN GREEK VERSION.

   1. A Greek version of any portion of the Old Testament presupposes
   intercourse between Israel and a Greek-speaking people. So long as the
   Hebrew race maintained its isolation, no occasion arose for the
   translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into a foreign tongue. As far as
   regards the countries west of Palestine, this isolation continued until
   the age of Alexander [1] ; it is therefore improbable that any Greek
   version of the Scriptures existed there before that era. Among the
   Alexandrian Jews of the second century before Christ there was a vague
   belief that Plato and other Greek philosophical writers were indebted
   for some of their teaching to a source of this kind [2] . Thus
   Aristobulus (ap. Clem. Al. strom. i. 22; cf. Eus, praep. ev. xiii. 12)
   writes: katekoloutheke de kai ho Platon te kath' emas nomothesia, kai
   phaneros esti periergasamenos hekasta ton en aute legomenon.
   diermeneutai de pro Demetriou huph' heterou [3] , pro tes Alexandrou
   kai Person epikrateseos, ta te kata ten ex Aiguptou exagogen ton
   Ebraion ton emeteron politon kai he ton gegonoton hapanton autois
   epiphaneia kai kratesis tes choras kai tes holes nomothesias
   epexegesis--words which seem to imply the existence before B.C. 400 of
   a translation which included at least the Books of Exodus, Deuteronomy,
   and Joshua. A similar claim has been found in the statement attributed
   by Pseudo-Aristeas to Demetrius of Phalerum: tou nomou ton Ioudaion
   biblia. . .ouch hos huparchei sesemantai, kathos hupo ton eidoton
   prosanapheretai [4] . But no fragments of these early translations have
   been produced, and it is more than probable that the story arose out of
   a desire on the part of the Hellenistic Jews to find a Hebrew origin
   for the best products of Greek thought [5] .

   2. The earliest and most important of the extant Greek versions of the
   Old Testament was an offspring of the 'Greek Dispersion' (he diaspora
   ton Hellenon, Jo. vii. 35), which began with the conquests of Alexander
   the Great [6] .

   The Hebrew Prophets foresaw that it was the destiny of their race to be
   scattered over the face of the world (Deut. xxviii. 25, xxx. 4, Jer.
   xv. 4, xxxiv. 17). The word diaspora (O.L. dispersio) employed by the
   Greek translators in these and similar passages (Cf. 2 Esdr. xi. 9, Ps.
   cxxxviii. (cxxxix.) tit. (codd. A^a T), cxlvi. (cxlvii.) 2, Judith v.
   19, Isa. xlix. 6, Jer. xiii. 14 (cod. '*), Dan. xii. 2 (LXX.), 2 Macc.
   i. 27) became the technical Greek term for Jewish communities in
   foreign lands, whether planted there by forcible deportation, or by
   their own free agency (Jo. vii. 35, Jas. i. 1, 1 Pet. i. 1) [7] . Such
   settlements were at first compulsory, and limited to countries east of
   Palestine. Between the eighth and sixth centuries B.C. the bulk of the
   population of both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms was swept away by
   Assyrian and Babylonian conquerors (2 Kings xvii. 6, xxiv. 14 ff., xxv.
   11 f., 21 f.). A part of the Babylonian captivity returned (Ezra i,
   ii.), but Babylonia and Mesopotamia continued to be the home of a large
   body of Jewish settlers (Tob. i. 14 ff., 4 Esdr. xiii. 39 ff., Philo ad
   Cai. 36, Acts ii. 9, Joseph. Ant. xi. 5. 2, xv. 3. 1, xviii. 9. 1 ff.).
   This 'Eastern' Dispersion need not detain us here. No Biblical version
   in the stricter sense [8] had its origin in Babylonia; there, as in
   Palestine, the services of the synagogue interpreter (mtvrgtn) sufficed
   for the rendering of the lections into Aramaic, and no desire was
   manifested on the part of the Gentile population to make themselves
   acquainted with the Hebrew scriptures. It was among the Jews who were
   brought into relation with Hellenic culture that the necessity arose
   for a written translation of the books of the canon. Egypt was the
   earliest home of the Hellenistic Jew, and it was on Egyptian soil that
   the earliest Greek version of the Old Testament was begun.

   3. Long before the time of Alexander Egypt possessed the nucleus of a
   Jewish colony. Shashanq, the Shishak of 1 K. xiv. 25 f., 2 Chr. xii. 2
   f., who invaded Palestine [9] in the tenth century B.C., may have
   carried into Egypt captives or hostages from the conquered cities whose
   names still appear upon the walls of the temple at Karnak. Isaiah (xix.
   19 f.) foresaw [10] that a time must come when the religious influence
   of Israel would make itself felt on the banks of the Nile, while he
   endeavoured to check the policy which led Judah to seek refuge from
   Assyrian aggression in an Egyptian alliance (xxx. 1 ff.). Jewish
   mercenaries are said to have fought in the expedition of Psammetichus
   I. against Ethiopia c. B.C. 650 (cf. Ps.-Arist.: heteron xummachion
   exapestalmenon pros ton ton Aithiopon basilea machesthai sun
   Psammiticho). The panic which followed the murder of Gedaliah drove a
   host of Jewish fugitives to Egypt, where they settled at Migdol
   (Magdolos), Tahpanhes (Taphnas = Daphne) [11] , Noph (Memphis), and
   Pathros (Pathoure) [12] , i.e. throughout the Delta, and even in Upper
   Egypt; and the descendants of those who survived were replenished, if
   we may believe Pseudo-Aristeas, by others who entered Egypt during the
   Persian period (ede men kai proteron hikanon eiseleluthoton sun to
   Perse). These earlier settlers were probably among the first to benefit
   by Alexander's policy, and may have been partly hellenised before his
   birth.

   4. Alexander's victory at Issos in B.C. 333 opened the gate of Syria to
   the conqueror. In the next year he received the submission of Tyre and
   Gaza and, according to Josephus, was on the point of marching upon
   Jerusalem when the statesmanship of the High Priest turned him from his
   purpose [13] . Whether the main features of this story be accepted or
   not, it is certain that the subsequent policy of Alexander was
   favourable to the Jews. His genius discovered in the Jewish people an
   instrument well fitted to assist him in carrying out his purpose of
   drawing East and West together. Jews served in his army (Hecataeus ap.
   Joseph. c. Ap. i. 22 eti ge men hoti kai Alexandro to basilei
   sunestrateusanto kai meta tauta tois diadochois autou memartureken);
   and such was his sense of their loyalty and courage that when
   Alexandria was founded (B.C. 332), although the design of the conqueror
   was to erect a monument to himself which should be essentially Greek
   [14] , he not only assigned a place in his new city to Jewish
   colonists, but admitted them to full citizenship.

   Joseph. ant. xix. 5. 2 epignous anekathen tous en Alexandreia Ioudaious

   Alexandros geras tes summachias edoken to metoikein kata ten polin ex
   isou moiras pros tous Hellenas.

   Mommsen indeed (Provinces, E. T. ii. p. 162 n.) expresses a doubt
   whether the grant of citizenship [15] was made before the time of
   Ptolemy I., but in the absence of any direct evidence to the contrary
   the repeated statement of Josephus justifies the belief that it
   originated with Alexander [16] .

   5. The premature death of Alexander (B.C. 323) wrecked his larger
   scheme, but the Jewish colony at Alexandria continued to flourish under
   the Ptolemies, who succeeded to the government of Egypt.

   It may be convenient to place here for reference the names and dates of
   the earlier Ptolemies. I. Lagi, or Soter (B.C. 322--285). II.
   Philadelphus (B.C. 285--247). III. Euergetes I. (B.C. 247--222). IV.
   Philopator I. (B.C. 222--205). V. Epiphanes (B.C. 205--182). VI.
   Eupator (B.C. 182). VII. Philometor (B.C. 182--146). VIII. Philopator
   II. (B.C. 146). IX. Euergetes II., also known as Physkon (B.C.
   146--117). Of the brief reigns of Eupator and the younger Philopator
   nothing is known.

   The first Ptolemy added considerably to the Jewish population of
   Alexandria. His expeditions to Palestine and capture of Jerusalem
   placed in his hands a large number of Jewish and Samaritan captives,
   and these were conveyed to Alexandria, where many of them acquired
   civic rights. The report of the King's liberality towards his captives,
   and of their prosperity in Egypt, attracted other Palestinians to
   Alexandria, and many came thither as voluntary settlers.

   A separate quarter of the city was assigned to the colony (Strabo ap.
   Joseph. ant. xiv. 7. 2 tes Alexandreias poleos aphoristai mega meros to
   ethnei touto [17] ); it lay in the north-east of Alexandria, along the
   shore, near the royal palace. Here the Jews lived under their own
   ethnarch [18] , who exercised judicial authority in all cases between
   Jew and Jew. They were permitted to follow their own religion and
   observe their national customs without molestation. Synagogues sprang
   up not only in the Jewish quarter, but at a later time in every part of
   the city (Philo ad Cai. 20, in Flacc. 6 [19] ). In the time of
   Philometor the Jews stood so high in the royal favour that they were
   suffered to convert a disused Egyptian temple at Leontopolis into a
   replica of the Temple at Jerusalem, and the Jewish rite was celebrated
   there until after the fall of the Holy City, when the Romans put a stop
   to it (Joseph. ant. xii. 9. 7, xiii. 3. 1, B. J. vii. 10. 4) [20] .
   Under these circumstances it is not surprising that shortly after the
   Christian era the Jewish colony in Egypt exceeded a million,
   constituting an eighth part of the population (Philo in Flacc. 6,
   Joseph. c. Ap. ii. 4). In the Fayûm villages were founded by Jews, and
   they lived on equal terms with the Greeks [21] . Nor were the Jewish
   settlers on the African coast limited to the Delta or to Egypt. A
   daughter colony was planted in Cyrenaica by the first Ptolemy, and at
   Cyrene as at Alexandria the Jews formed an important section of the
   community. The Jew of Cyrene meets us already in the days of the
   Maccabees (1 Macc. xv. 23, 2 Macc. ii. 23), and he was a familiar
   figure at Jerusalem in the Apostolic age (Mt. xxvii. 32, Acts ii. 10,
   vi. 9 [22] , xi. 20, xiii. 1; cf Strabo ap. Joseph. ant. xiv. 7. 2).

   6. The Jews of the Dispersion everywhere retained their religion and
   their loyalty to national institutions. In each of these settlements
   among Gentile peoples the Holy City possessed a daughter, whose
   attachment to her was not less strong than that of her children at
   home. "Jerusalem," in the words of Agrippa [23] , "was the mother city,
   not of a single country, but of most of the countries of the world,
   through the colonies which she sent forth at various times." No colony
   was more dutiful than the Alexandrian. The possession of a local
   sanctuary at Leontopolis did not weaken its devotion to the temple at
   Jerusalem [24] ; pilgrimages were still made to Jerusalem at the great
   festivals (Philo ap. Eus. praep. ev. viii. 14. 64; cf. Acts ii. 10);
   the Temple tribute was collected in Egypt with no less punctuality than
   in Palestine (Philo de monarch. ii. 3). But it was impossible for Jews
   who for generations spent their lives and carried on their business in
   Greek towns to retain their Semitic speech. In Palestine after the
   Return, Aramaic gradually took the place of Hebrew in ordinary
   intercourse, and after the time of Alexander Greek became to some
   extent a rival of Aramaic. In Alexandria a knowledge of Greek was not a
   mere luxury but a necessity of common life [25] . If it was not
   required by the State as a condition of citizenship [26] , yet
   self-interest compelled the inhabitants of a Greek capital to acquire
   the language of the markets and the Court. A generation or two may have
   sufficed to accustom the Alexandrian Jews to the use of the Greek
   tongue. The Jewish settlers in Lower Egypt who were there at the coming
   of Alexander had probably gained some knowledge of Greek before the
   founding of his new city [27] ; and the children of Alexander's
   mercenaries, as well as many of the immigrants from Palestine in the
   days of Soter, may well have been practically bilingual. Every year of
   residence in Alexandria would increase their familiarity with Greek and
   weaken their hold upon the sacred tongue [28] . Any prejudice which
   might have existed against the use of a foreign language would speedily
   disappear under a rule which secured full liberty in worship and faith.
   The adoption of the Greek tongue was a tribute gladly paid by the
   Alexandrian Jews to the great Gentile community which sheltered and
   cherished them.

   The Greek which they learnt was the koine as colloquially used in
   Alexandria: based on the less elevated kind of Attic, with some loss of
   the niceties; but less exclusive in its vocabulary, retaining many old
   Ionic and Homeric words, and adopting, but less freely, others of
   foreign origin. When the Jews employed this tongue, now common to the
   regions of Greek life and Greek conquest, to translate the Old
   Testament, they naturally used forms of expression which matched the
   original as closely as possible; though many of them were more or less
   prevalent, or paralleled, in the koine. Their ingrained habits of
   thought, and their native speech, even if partly forgotten, led them to
   give constant prominence to these expressions, which correspond with
   Semitisms, as well as, to some extent, with the current Greek speech
   and colloquial writings.

   7. The 'Septuagint [29] ,' or the Greek version of the Old Testament
   which was on the whole the work of Alexandrian Jews, is, written in
   full, the Interpretatio septuaginta virorum or seniorum, i.e. the
   translation of which the first instalment was attributed by Alexandrian
   tradition to seventy or seventy-two Jewish elders. In the most ancient
   Greek MSS. of the Old Testament it is described as the version
   'according to the LXX.' (kata tous hebdomekonta, para hebdomekonta, O.
   T. in Greek, i. p. 103, ii. p. 479), and quoted by the formula hoi o or
   hoi ob'. All forms of the name point back to a common source, the story
   of the origin of the version which is told in the pseudonymous letter
   entitled Aristeas Philokratei. See App.


   Literature. The text of the letter of Aristeas is printed in the
   Appendix to this volume. It will be found also in Hody de Bibl. text.
   orig. (Oxon. 1705), and in Constantinus Oeconomus peri ton o
   hermeneuton biblia d' (Athens, 1849); a better text was given by M.
   Schmidt in Merx, Archiv f. wissensch. Erforschung a. A. T. i. p. 241
   ff.; the latest separate edition appeared in 1900 under the title:
   Aristeae ad Philocratem epistula cum ceteris de origine versionis LXX.
   interpretum testimoniis. Ludovici Mendelssohn schedis usus ed. Paulus
   Wendland. A trans. by Mr H. St J. Thackeray appeared in J. Q. R. Ap.
   1903 (since reprinted). For the earlier editions see Fabricius-Harles,
   iii. 660 ff.; the editio princeps of the Greek text was published at
   Basle in 1561.

   The controversies raised by the letter may be studied in Hody or in
   Fabricius-Harles; cf. Rosenmüller, Handbuch f. d. Literatur d. bibl.

   collected); cf. Van Ess, Epilegg. p. 29 f.


   8. The writer professes to be a courtier in the service of
   Philadelphus, a Greek who is interested in the antiquities of the
   Jewish people [30] . Addressing his brother Philocrates, he relates the
   issue of a journey which he had recently made to Jerusalem. It appears
   that Demetrius Phalereus [31] , who is described as librarian of the
   royal library at Alexandria, had in conversation with the King
   represented the importance of procuring for the library a translation
   of the Jewish laws (ta ton Ioudaion nomima metagraphes axia kai tes
   para soi bibliothekes einai). Philadelphus fell in with the suggestion,
   and despatched an embassy to Jerusalem with a letter to the High Priest
   Eleazar, in which the latter was desired to send to Alexandria six
   elders learned in the law from each of the tribes of Israel to execute
   the work of translation. In due course the seventy-two elders, whose
   names are given, arrived in Egypt, bringing with them a copy of the
   Hebrew Law written in letters of gold on rolls [32] composed of skins
   (sun . . . tais diaphorois diphtherais en hais he nomothesia gegrammene
   chrusographia tois Ioudaikois grammasi). A banquet followed, at which
   the King tested the attainments of the Jewish elders with hard
   questions. Three days afterwards the work of translation began. The
   translators were conducted by Demetrius along the Heptastadion [33] to
   the island of Pharos, where a building conveniently furnished and
   remote from the distractions of the city was provided for their use.
   Here Demetrius, in the words of Aristeas, 'exhorted them to accomplish
   the work of translation, since they were well supplied with all that
   they could want. So they set to work, comparing their several results
   and making them agree; and whatever they agreed upon was suitably
   copied under the direction of Demetrius. . . . In this way the
   transcription was completed in seventy-two days, as it that period had
   been pre-arranged.'

   The completed work was read by Demetrius to the Jewish community, who
   received it with enthusiasm and begged that a copy might be placed in
   the hands of their leaders; and a curse was solemnly pronounced upon
   any who should presume to add to the version or to take from it. After
   this the Greek Pentateuch was read to the King, who expressed delight
   and surprise, greeted the book with a gesture of reverence proskunesas,
   and desired that it should be preserved with scrupulous care (ekeleuse
   megalen epimeleian poieisthai ton biblion kai sunterein hagnos).


   9. The story of Aristeas is repeated more or less fully by the
   Alexandrian writers Aristobulus and Philo, and by Josephus.


   Aristobulus ap. Eus. praep. ev. xiii. 12. 2: he de hole hermeneia ton
   dia tou nomou panton epi tou prosagoreuthentos Philadelphou basileos
   sou de progonou [he is addressing Philometor] prosenenkamenou meizona

   Josephus, ant. i. prooem. 3: Ptolemaion men ho deuteros malista de
   basileus peri paideian kai biblion sunagogen spoudasas exairetos
   ephilotimethe ton hemeteron nomon kai ten kat' auton diataxin tes
   politeias eis ten Hellada phonen metalabein ktl. In ant. xii. 2. 1--15
   Josephus gives a full account obviously based on Aristeas (whom he
   calls Aristaios, and to a great extent verbally identical with the
   letter.


   The testimony of Josephus establishes only the fact that the letter of
   Aristeas was current in Palestine during the first century A.D. Philo,
   on the other hand, represents an Alexandrian tradition which was
   perhaps originally independent of the letter, and is certainly not
   entirely consistent with it. He states (l.c.) that the completion of
   the work of the LXX. was celebrated at Alexandria down to his own time
   by a yearly festival at the Pharos (mechri n un ana pan etos heorte kai
   paneguris agetai kata ten Pharon neson, eis hen ouk Ioudaioi monon alla
   kai pampletheis hermeneias exelampse ktl.). A popular anniversary of
   this kind can scarcely have grown out of a literary work so artificial
   and so wanting in the elements which ensure popularity as the letter of
   Aristeas. The fragment of Aristobulus carries us much further back than
   the witness of Philo and Josephus. It was addressed to a Ptolemy who
   was a descendant of Philadelphus, and who is identified both by
   Eusebius (l.c.) and by Clement [35] (strom. 1. 22) with Philometor.
   Whether Aristobulus derived his information from Aristeas is uncertain,
   but his words, if we admit their genuineness, establish the fact that
   the main features of the story were believed by the literary Jews of
   Alexandria, and even at the Court, more than a century and a half
   before the Christian era and within a century of the date assigned by
   Aristeas to the translation of the Law.


   10. From the second century A.D. the letter of Aristeas is quoted or
   its contents are summarised by the fathers of the Church, who in
   general receive the story without suspicion, and add certain fresh
   particulars.


   Cf. Justin, apol. i. 31, dial. 68, 71, 'cohort. ad Graecos' 13 ff.;
   Iren. iii. 21, 2 f.; Clem. Alex. strom. i. 22, 148 f.; Tertullian,
   apol. 18; Anatolius ap. Eus. H. E. vii. 32; Eusebius, praep. ev. viii.
   1--9, ix. 38; Cyril of Jerusalem, catech. iv. 34; Hilary, prol. ad
   Psalmos, tract. in Pss. ii., cxviii.; Epiphanius, de mens. et pond.
   §§ 3, 6; Philastrius de haer. 138; Jerome, praef. in Gen., praef. in
   libr. quaest. Hebr.; Augustine, de civ. Dei xvii. 42 f., de doctr. Chr.
   ii. 22: Theodore of Mopsuestia in Habakk. ii., in Zeph. i.; Chrysostom,
   or. i. adv. Jud., c. 6, hom. iv. in Gen., c. 4; Theodoret, praef. in
   Psalmos; Cyril of Alexandria, adv. Julian. or. 1; Pseudo-Athanasius,
   synops. scr. sacr. § 77; the anonymous dialogue of Timothy and Aquila
   (ed. Conybeare, Oxford, 1898, p. 90 f.).


   Most of these Christian writers, in distinct contradiction to the
   statement of Aristeas, represent the Seventy as having worked
   separately, adding that when the results were compared at the end of
   the task they were found to be identical (so Irenaeus, Clement of
   Alexandria, Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine, &c.). The author of the
   Cohortatio ad Graecos [36] declares that at Alexandria he had been
   shewn the vestiges of the cells in which the translators had worked
   (autoi en te Alexandreia genomenoi kai ta ichne ton oikiskon en te
   Pharo heorakotes eti sozomena, kai para ton ekei hos ta patria
   pareilephoton akekootes tauta apangellomen). This story of the cells
   therefore was probably of Alexandrian origin, and had grown out of the
   local belief in the inspiration of the Seventy which appears already in
   the words of Philo quoted above [37] . The Fathers generally accept
   both the belief and the legend which it generated, though the latter
   sometimes undergoes slight modification, as when Epiphanius groups the
   LXXII. in pairs (zuge zuge kat' oikiskon). Jerome is an honourable
   exception; he realises that the tale of the cells is inconsistent with
   the earlier tradition (prol. in Gen. "nescio quis primus auctor LXX
   cellulas Alexandriae mendacio suo exstruxerit, quibus divisi eadem
   scriptitarint, quum Aristeas . . . et Josephus nihil tale retulerint"),
   and rightly protests against the doctrine which was at the root of the
   absurdity ("aliud est enim vatem, aliud est esse interpretem") [38] .


   11. Doubts as to the genuineness of the Aristeas-letter were first
   expressed by Ludovicus de Vives in his commentary on Aug. de civ. Dei,
   xviii. 4 (published in 1522), and after him by Joseph Scaliger. Ussher
   and Voss defended the letter, but its claim to be the work of a
   contemporary of Philadelphus was finally demolished by Humphry Hody,
   Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford (1698-1706) [39] . A few later
   writers have pleaded in its favour (e.g. Grinfield Apology for the
   LXX., and Constantinus Oeconomus, op. cit.); but the great majority of
   modern scholars, and perhaps all living experts, recognise the
   unhistorical character of much of the story of Aristeas.

   Indeed it scarcely needed the massive learning of Hody to convict the
   letter of Aristeas of being pseudonymous, and to a large extent
   legendary. The selection of the elders from all the tribes of Israel
   awakens suspicions; their names are clearly imaginary; the recurrence
   of the number seventy-two seems to have struck even the writer as open
   to remark [40] ; the letters of Philadelphus and Eleazar are of the
   same stamp as the confessedly fictitious correspondence between the
   Egyptian and the Palestinian Jews in 2 Maccabees [41] . Above all,
   whereas the letter professes to have been written by a Greek and a
   pagan, its purpose proclaims it to be the work of a Jew; while it
   addresses itself to Gentile readers, its obvious aim is to glorify the
   Jewish race, and to diffuse information about their sacred books. On
   the other hand, though the story as 'Aristeas' tells it is doubtless a
   romance, it must not be hastily inferred that it has no historical
   basis. That the writer was a Jew who lived in Egypt under the Ptolemies
   seems to be demonstrated by the knowledge which he displays of life at
   the Alexandrian Court [42] . There is also reason to suppose that he
   wrote within fifty years of the death of Philadelphus, and his
   principal facts are endorsed, as we have seen, by a writer of the next
   generation [43] . It is difficult to believe that a document, which
   within a century of the events relates the history of a literary
   undertaking in which the Court and the scholars of Alexandria were
   concerned, can be altogether destitute of truth. Detailed criticism is
   impossible in this place, but it is necessary to examine the
   credibility of the chief features of the romance so far as they affect
   questions relating to the date and origin of the LXX. There are certain
   points in the letter of Aristeas which demand investigation, especially
   the statements (1) that the translation of the Law was made in the time
   of Philadelphus; (2) that it was undertaken at the desire of the King,
   and for the royal library; (3) that the translators and the Hebrew
   rolls which they used were brought from Jerusalem; and (4) that their
   translation when completed was welcomed both by Jews and Greeks [44] .


   12. There is no improbability in the first of these statements. The
   personal tastes of Philadelphus, if by no means purely literary,
   included a fancy for the society of scholars and the accumulation of
   books [45] . He founded a second library at the Serapeion to receive
   the overflow of that which Soter had established near the Museum and
   the Palace [46] . His syncretistic temperament disposed him to listen
   to the representatives of various creeds. A Buddhist mission from the
   Ganges found a welcome at his court [47] ; and the reign which produced
   Manetho's Greek history of Egyptian institutions may well have yielded
   also a translation into Greek of the Hebrew sacred books. The presence
   of a large Jewish colony at Alexandria could hardly have failed to
   awaken in the King and his scholars of the Museum an interest in the
   ancient laws and literature of the Jewish race. For these reasons
   modern scholars have for the most part shewn no desire to disturb the
   tradition which assigns the Alexandrian version of the Law to the days
   of Philadelphus.


   One exception must be noted. The late Professor Grätz maintained with
   much ingenuity that the Greek Pentateuch was a work of the reign of
   Philometor, thus transferring the inception of the LXX. from the middle
   of the third century to the middle of the second [48] .

   His opinion was based partly on the fact that the Jewish colony at
   Alexandria touched the zenith of its influence under Philometor, partly
   on internal grounds. Under the latter head he insisted on the
   translation in Lev. xxiii. 11 of the phrase chsbt mmhrt by te epaurion
   tes proes. The Pharisees understood the word sbt in that context to
   refer to the day after the Paschal Sabbath i.e. Nisan 15, while the
   Sadducees adhered to the usual meaning. Grätz argued with much force
   that, since the rendering of the LXX. shews evident signs of Pharisaic
   influence, the version itself must have been later than the rise of the
   Pharisees [49] . But v. 15 renders the same words by apo tes epaurion
   tou sabbatou, and as it is not likely that a translator who had of set
   purpose written tes protes in v. 11 would have let tou sabbatou escape
   him a little further down, we must suppose that tou s. stood originally
   in both verses and that tes pr. is due to a Pharisaic corrector who
   left his work incomplete. But a partial correction of the passage in
   the interests of Pharisaism points to the version being pre-Maccabean,
   a conclusion quite opposite to that which Dr Grätz desired to draw [50]
   .


   There is, moreover, positive evidence that the Alexandrian version of
   Genesis at least was in existence considerably before the beginning of
   Philometor's reign. It was used by the Hellenist Demetrius, fragments
   of whose treatise Peri ton en te Ioudaia basileon are preserved by
   Clement (strom. i 21) and Eusebius (praep. ev. ix. 21, 29). The
   following specimens may suffice to prove this assertion.


   Demetrius Genesis (LXX.)

   anti ton melon tou mandragorou.

   heuren mela mandragorou . . . anti ton mandragoron (XXX. 14 f.).

   angelon tou theou palaisai kai hapsasthai tou platous tou merou tou
   Iakob.

   epalaien . . . kai hepsato tou platous ou merou Iakob (xxxii. 25).

   legein ktenotrophous autous einai.

   ereite Andres ktenotrophoi esmen (xlvi. 34).


   As Demetrius carries his chronology no further than the reign of
   Philopator, it may be assumed that he lived under the fourth Ptolemy
   [51] . He is thus the earliest of the Alexandrian Hellenistic writers;
   yet equally with the latest he draws his quotations of the Book of
   Genesis from the LXX. It may fairly be argued that a version, which at
   the end of the third century B.C. had won its way to acceptance among
   the literary Jews of Alexandria, probably saw the light not later than
   the reign of Philadelphus.


   13. Both 'Aristeas' and Aristobulus associate with the inception of the
   LXX. the name of Demetrius Phalereus [52] . Aristobulus merely
   represents Demetrius as having 'negociated the matter'
   (pragmateusamenou ta peri touton), but Aristeas states that he did so
   (1) in the capacity of head of the royal library (katastatheis epi tes
   tou basileos bibliothekes), and (2) in the days of Philadelphus, with
   whom he appears to be on intimate terms. Both these particulars are
   certainly unhistorical. Busch [53] has shewn that the office of
   librarian was filled under Philadelphus by Zenodotus of Ephesus, and on
   the decease of Zenodotus by Eratosthenes. Moreover Demetrius, so far
   from being intimate with Philadelphus, was sent into exile soon after
   the accession of that monarch, and died a little later on from the bite
   of an asp, probably administered at the King's instigation (c. B.C.
   283) [54] . Thus, if Demetrius took part in the inception of the LXX.,
   he must have done so during the reign of Soter. This is not in itself
   improbable. He had taken refuge in Egypt as early as B.C. 307, and for
   many years had been a trusted adviser of the first Ptolemy; and it is
   not unlikely that the project of translating the Jewish Law was
   discussed between him and the royal founder of the Alexandrian library,
   and that the work was really due to his suggestion [55] , though his
   words did not bear fruit until after his death. The point is of
   importance to the student of the LXX. only in so far as it has to do
   with the question whether the version was made under official guidance.
   The breakdown of the chronology of this part of the story of Aristeas
   leaves us free to abandon the hypothesis of direct intervention on the
   part of the King, and internal evidence certainly justifies us in doing
   so. An official version would assuredly have avoided such barbarisms as
   geioras, hein, sabbata [56] , when such Greek equivalents as
   proselutos, dichoun, anapausis, were available. The whole style of the
   version is alien from the purpose of a book intended for literary use,
   nor is it conceivable that under such circumstances Jewish translators,
   Palestinian or Alexandrian, would have been left without the advice and
   help of experts in the Greek tongue.

   Thus everything points to the conclusion that the version arose out of
   the needs of the Alexandrian Jews. Whilst in Palestine the
   Aramaic-speaking Jews were content with the interpretation of the
   Methurgeman, at Alexandria the Hebrew lesson was gladly exchanged for a
   lesson read from a Greek translation, and the work of the interpreter
   was limited to exegesis [57] . In the closing paragraphs of the letter
   of Aristeas which describe the joy with which the work of the LXXII.
   was welcomed by the Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria, the writer
   unconsciously reveals the true history of the version, when he
   represents the Jews as having heard and welcomed the Greek Pentateuch
   before it was presented to the King [58] . But it is not improbable
   that the King encouraged the work of translation with the view of
   promoting the use of the Greek language by the settlers [59] as well as
   for the purpose of gratifying his own curiosity.


   14. The Greek of the Alexandrian Pentateuch is Egyptian, and, as far as
   we can judge, not such as Palestinian translators would have written.
   Instances are not indeed wanting of translations executed in Egypt by
   Palestinians; the most noteworthy [60] is the Wisdom of the Son of
   Sirach, which, as the prologue tells us, was turned into Greek by the
   grandson of the writer after a prolonged visit to the banks of the Nile
   (paragenetheis eis Haigupton kai sunchronisas); but the clumsy Greek of
   the prologue, and the stiff artificiality of the book, offer a marked
   contrast to the simple style of the Pentateuch. That the latter is
   mainly the work of Alexandrian Jews appears from more than one
   consideration. An older generation of Biblical scholars pointed to the
   occurrence in the LXX., and especially in the Pentateuch, of such words
   of Egyptian origin as achei (Gen. xli. 2 ff.), kondu (Gen. xliv. 2
   ff.), ibis (Lev. xi. 17; Deut. xiv. 16), bussos (Exod. xxv.-xxxix.
   passim) and such characteristically Egyptian terms as didrachmon,
   aletheia (= ttym), archimageiros, archioinochoos and the like. The
   argument is not conclusive, since after the time of Alexander the koine
   contained elements drawn from various localities [61] . But recent
   discoveries in Egypt have yielded a criterion of Egyptian Greek which
   has been applied to the LXX. with definite results. In 1892 Prof.
   Mahaffy was able to write: "in the vocabulary of the papyri we find a
   closer likeness to the Greek of the LXX. than to any other book I could
   name [62] ." This statement has been abundantly justified by the
   publication of Deissmann's Bibelstudien (Marburg, 1895), and Neue
   Bibelstudien (1897), where a number of the peculiar or characteristic
   words and forms of the LXX. are shewn to have been in common use among
   Egyptian Greeks of the third and second centuries B.C. [63] The
   vocabulary and style of the LXX. will be treated in a later chapter;
   for the present it is enough to say that they are such as to discredit
   the attribution of the Greek Pentateuch to a company consisting
   exclusively or chiefly of Palestinian Jews. The LXX. as a whole, or at
   any rate the earlier part of the collection, is a monument of
   Alexandrian Greek as it was spoken by the Jewish colony in the Delta
   under the rule of the Ptolemies [64] .

   The story of the rolls being written in letters of gold and sent to the
   King by the High Priest may be dismissed at once; it belongs to the
   picturesque setting of the romance. But there is nothing improbable in
   the statement that the Hebrew rolls were freshly brought from Jerusalem
   [65] , for communication between Jerusalem and Alexandria was frequent
   during the reigns of the earlier Ptolemies. Yet the legend may be
   intended to represent the loyalty of the colony towards the metropolis,
   and the conviction of the Alexandrian Jews that in their Greek version
   they possessed the same sacred texts which their brethren in Judaea
   read in Hebrew. Nothing was further from their intention than to create
   an Alexandrian canon, or an Alexandrian type of text. The point is one
   which it is important to remember.

   The welcome accorded to the Greek version by the Jews of Alexandria was
   doubtless, as Aristeas represents, both cordial and permanent; nor need
   we doubt that Philadelphus and his scholars approved what had been
   done. Insignificant and even intolerable as a literary work, the
   version promised to supply the Greek scholars of Alexandria with a
   trustworthy account of Hebrew origins. There is however little or no
   trace of the use of the LXX. by pagan writers [66] ; the style was
   probably enough to deter them from studying it, and the Hellenistic
   Jews of a somewhat later date rendered the task unnecessary by
   presenting the history of their country in more attractive forms. As to
   the preservation of the original in the Alexandrian libraries, we have
   no evidence beyond Tertullian's scarcely trustworthy statement, "Hodie
   apud Serapeum Ptolemaei bibliothecae cum ipsis Hebraicis litteris
   exhibentur [67] ."


   15. It has been stated (p. 11) that the letter of Aristeas does not
   profess to describe the origin of any part of the Alexandrian Bible
   except the Pentateuch [68] . This was evident to Josephus: ant. 1.
   prooem. 3 oude gar pasan ekeinos (sc. Ptolemaios ho deuteros) ephthe
   labein ten anagraphen, alla mona ta tou nomou paredosan hoi
   pemphthentes epi ten exegesin eis Alexandreian. Christian writers,
   however, failed to notice this limitation; the whole Greek Bible was
   familiarly known as the version of the LXX., and no misgivings were
   felt upon the matter except by Jerome, whose intercourse with the
   Rabbis had opened his eyes on this and other matters about which the
   Jews were better informed: "tota schola Judaeorum (he writes) quinque
   tantum libros Moysis a LXX. translatos asserunt [69] ." Epiphanius goes
   so far as to apportion the books of the Hebrew canon among thirty-six
   pairs of translators [70] . Nevertheless the Jews were unquestionably
   right; Aristeas has nothing to say about the translation of any books
   beyond the first five. His silence as to the Prophets and the
   Hagiographa is entirely consistent with the conditions of the period in
   which he fixes his story. The canon of the Prophets seems to have
   scarcely reached completion before the High-Priesthood of Simon II.
   (219--199 B.C.) [71] . If this was so in Palestine, at Alexandria
   certainly there would be no recognised body of Prophetic writings in
   the reign of the second Ptolemy. The Torah alone was ready for
   translation, for it was complete, and its position as a collection of
   sacred books was absolutely secure.


   16. But when the example had once been set of rendering sacred books
   into Greek, it would assuredly be followed as often as fresh rolls
   arrived from Jerusalem which bore the stamp of Palestinian recognition,
   if a bilingual Jew was found ready to undertake the task. A happy
   accident enables us to estimate roughly the extent to which this
   process had gone by the sixth or seventh decade of the second century.
   The writer of the prologue to Sirach, who arrived in Egypt in the 38th
   year of Euergetes--i.e. in the year 132 B.C. if, as is probable, the
   Euergetes intended was the second of that name--incidentally uses words
   which imply that "the Law, the Prophets, and the rest of the books"
   were already current in a translation (ou gar isodunamei auta en
   heautois Ebraisti legomena, kai hotan metachthe eis heteran glossan; ou
   monon de tauta, alla kai autos ho nomos kai hai propheteiai kai ta
   loipa ton biblion ou mikran ten diaphoran echei en heautois legomena).
   This sentence reveals the progress which had been made in the work of
   translation between the second Ptolemy and the ninth. Under Euergetes
   II. the Alexandrian Jews possessed, in addition to the original Greek
   Pentateuch, a collection of prophetic books, and a number of other
   writings belonging to their national literature [72] which had not as
   yet formed themselves into a complete group. The latter are doubtless
   the books which are known as ktvvym or Hagiographa. Since the author of
   the prologue was a Palestinian Jew, we may perhaps assume that under
   hai propheteiai and ta loipa ton biblion he includes such books of both
   classes as were already in circulation in Palestine. If this inference
   is a safe one, it will follow that all the 'Prophets' of the Hebrew
   canon, 'former' and 'latter,' had been translated before B.C. 132.

   With regard to the Hagiographa, in some cases we have data which lead
   to a more definite conclusion. Eupolemus, who, if identical with the
   person of that name mentioned in 1 Macc. viii. 17, wrote about the
   middle of the second century, makes use of the Greek Chronicles, as
   Freudenthal has clearly shewn [73] . Ezra-Nehemiah, originally
   continuous with Chronicles, was probably translated at the same time as
   that book. Aristeas (not the pseudonymous author of the letter, but the
   writer of a treatise peri Ioudaion quotes the book of Job according to
   the LXX., and has been suspected [74] of being the author of the
   remarkable codicil attached to it (Job xlii. 17 b--e). The footnote to
   the Greek Esther, which states that that book was brought to Egypt in
   the 4th year of "Ptolemy and Cleopatra" (probably i.e. of Ptolemy
   Philometor), may have been written with the purpose of giving
   Palestinian sanction to the Greek version of that book; but it vouches
   for the fact that the version was in circulation before the end of the
   second century B.C. [75] The Psalter of the LXX. appears to be quoted
   in 1 Macc. vii. 17 (Ps. lxxviii. = lxxix. 2), and the Greek version of
   1 Maccabees probably belongs to the first century B.C. At what time the
   Greek Psalter assumed its present form there is no evidence to shew,
   but it is reasonable to suppose that the great Palestinian collections
   of sacred song did not long remain unknown to the Alexandrian Jews [76]
   ; and even on the hypothesis of certain Psalms being Maccabean, the
   later books of the Greek Psalter may be assigned to the second half of
   the second century.


   17. On the whole, though the direct evidence is fragmentary, it is
   probable that before the Christian era Alexandria possessed the whole,
   or nearly the whole, of the Hebrew Scriptures in a Greek translation.
   For the first century A.D. we have the very important evidence of
   Philo, who uses the LXX. and quotes largely from many of the books.
   There are indeed some books of the Hebrew canon to which he does not
   seem to refer, i.e. Ruth, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Esther,
   Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel [77] . But, as Professor Ryle points out,
   "it may be safely assumed that Ruth and Lamentations were, in Philo's
   time, already united to Judges and Jeremiah in the Greek Scriptures";
   and Ezekiel, as one of the greater Prophets, had assuredly found its
   way to Alexandria before A.D. 1. Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Esther,
   Daniel, which "seem to have been among the latest books to be received
   into the Sacred Canon [78] ," may have been purposely neglected by
   Philo, as not possessing canonical authority. But it would be
   precarious to conclude that they had not been as yet translated into
   Greek; the Book of Esther, as we have seen, was probably current at
   Alexandria during the second century B.C. Two other Jewish, but not
   Alexandrian, authorities assist us to ascertain the contents of the
   Greek Bible in the first century A.D. (a) The New Testament shews a
   knowledge of the LXX. version in most of the books which it quotes, and
   it quotes all the books of the Old Testament except Ezra, Nehemiah,
   Esther, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and certain of the Minor
   Prophets [79] . As in the case of Philo, it is possible, though
   scarcely probable, that Esther, Ecclesiastes and the Song were passed
   by as not having received the stamp of canonicity; but the silence of
   the Apostolic writers about them does not in any case prove that Greek
   translations of these books were not yet in circulation among
   Palestinian Jews. (b) Josephus, who knew and used the LXX.,
   unfortunately has no explicit statement as to the extent of the Greek
   version; but his list of the Hebrew books is practically identical with
   our own, and, as it occurs in a treatise intended for Gentile readers,
   it is perhaps safe to assume that he speaks of books accessible in a
   translation; "in other words, that he writes with the LXX. version
   before him [80] ."

   Thus while the testimony of the first century A.D. does not absolutely
   require us to believe that all the books of the Hebrew canon had been
   translated and were circulated in a Greek version during the Apostolic
   age, such a view is not improbable; and it is confirmed by the fact
   that they are all contained in the canon of the Greek Bible which the
   Christian Church received from its Jewish predecessors. It is another
   question whether the versions were all of Alexandrian origin, or the
   only Greek translations which claimed to represent the corresponding
   Hebrew books. In a few cases there were certainly rival interpretations
   or recensions of the same book (e.g. in Judges, Daniel, Tobit). But as
   a whole the work of translation was doubtless carried out at
   Alexandria, where it was begun; and the Greek Bible of the Hellenistic
   Jews and the Catholic Church may rightly be styled the Alexandrian
   Greek version of the Old Testament.

   [30] From the mention of Cyprus as 'the island' (§ 5) it has been
   inferred that Aristeas was a Cypriot. The name occurs freely in
   inscriptions from the islands of the Aegean and the coast of Caria (C.
   I. G. 2262, 2266, 2349, 2399, 2404, 2655, 2693, 2694, 2723, 2727, 2781,
   2892), and was borne by a Cyprian sculptor (see D. G. and R. B., i.
   293). Wendland, however, thinks 'the island' is Pharos, as certainly in
   § 301. The Aristeas who wrote peri Ioudaion (Euseb. praep. ev. ix. 25)
   was doubtless an Alexandrian Jew who, as a Hellenist, assumed a Greek
   name.

  CHAPTER II.

    LATER GREEK VERSIONS.

   1. At Alexandria and in Egypt generally the Alexandrian version was
   regarded, as Philo plainly says, with a reverence scarcely less than
   that which belonged to the original. It was the Bible of the Egyptian
   Jews, even of those who belonged to the educated and literary class.
   This feeling was shared by the rest of the Hellenistic world. In
   Palestine indeed the version seems to have been received with less
   enthusiasm, and whether it was used in the synagogues is still
   uncertain. But elsewhere its acceptance by Greek-speaking Jews was
   universal during the Apostolic age and in the next generation.


   On the question of the use of the LXX. in the synagogues see Hody iii.
   1. 1, Frankel, Vorstudien, p. 56 ff., König, Einleitung, p. 105ff.; the
   negative is stoutly maintained by J. Lightfoot, hor. Hebr. (add. to 1
   Cor. xiv.). If the Ep. to the Hebrews was addressed to the Church of
   Jerusalem, the preponderating use of the LXX. in its quotations from
   the O. T. is strong evidence, so far as it goes, for the acceptance of
   the LXX. by Palestinian Hellenists. Its use by St Paul vouches for the
   practice of the Hellenists of Asia Minor and Europe; no rival version
   had gained circulation at Antioch, Ephesus, or Rome. In the next
   century we have the evidence of Justin (apol. i. 31 emeinan hai bibloi
   [the translated books] kai par' Aiguptiois mechri tou deuro kai
   pantachou para pasin eisin Ioudaiois: dial. 72 haute he perikope he ek
   ton logon tou Ieremiou eti estin engegrammene en tisin antigraphois ton
   en sunagogais Ioudaion), Tertullian (apol. 18 "Judaea palam
   lectitant"), Pseudo-Justin (cohort. ad Gr. 13 to de par' Ioudaiois eti
   kai nun tas te hemetera theosebeia diapherousas sozesthai biblous,
   theias pronoias ergon huper hemon gegonen . . . apo tes ton Ioudaion
   sunagoges tautas axioumen prokomizesthai).


   2. When the LXX. passed into the hands of the Church and was used in
   controversy with Jewish antagonists, the Jews not unnaturally began to
   doubt the accuracy of the Alexandrian version (Justin, dial. 68 tolmosi
   legein ten exegesin hen exegesanto hoi hebdomekonta humon presbuteroi
   para Ptolemaio to ton Aiguption basilei genomenoi me einai en tisin
   alethe). The crucial instance was the rendering of tslth by parthenos
   in Isa. vii. 14, where neanis, it was contended, would have given the
   true meaning of the Hebrew word (ib. 71, 84; Iren. iii. 21. 1). But the
   dissatisfaction with which the LXX. was regarded by the Jewish leaders
   of the second century was perhaps not altogether due to polemical
   causes. The LXX. "did not suit the newer school of [Jewish]
   interpretation, it did not correspond with the received text [81] ." An
   official text differing considerably from the text accepted in earlier
   times had received the approval of the Rabbis, and the Alexandrian
   version, which represented the older text, began to be suspected and to
   pass into disuse. Attempts were made to provide something better for
   Greek-speaking Israelites (Justin, dial. 71 autoi exegeisthai
   peirontai). Of two such fresh translations Irenaeus speaks in terms of
   reprehension (l.c. ouch hos enioi phasin ton nun methermeneuein
   tolmonton ten graphen . . . hos Theodotion . . . ho Ephesios kai Akulas
   ho Pontikos, amphoteroi Ioudaioi proselutoi). Origen, who realised the
   importance of these translations, was able to add to those of Aquila
   and Theodotion the version of Symmachus and three others which were
   anonymous [82] . Of the anonymous versions little remains, but Aquila,
   Theodotion, and Symmachus are represented by numerous and in some cases
   important fragments.

   3. Aquila. The name had been borne in the Apostolic age by a native of
   Pontus who was of Jewish birth (Acts xviii. 2 Ioudaion onomati Akulan,
   Pontikon to genei). Aquila the translator was also of Pontus, from the
   famous sea-port [83] Sinope, which had been constituted by Julius
   Caesar a Roman colony; but he was of Gentile origin. He lived in the
   reign of Hadrian (A.D. 117--138), and was a connexion of the Emperor
   (pentherides, Epiph., Dial. of Timothy and Aquila; pentheros, Ps.-Ath.,
   Chron. Pasch.). Hadrian employed his relative to superintend the
   building of Aelia Capitolina on the site of Jerusalem, and while there
   Aquila was converted to Christianity by Christians who had returned
   from Pella. Refusing, however, to abandon the pagan practice of
   astrology, he was excommunicated; upon which he shewed his resentment
   by submitting to circumcision and attaching himself to the teaching of
   the Jewish Rabbis. The purpose of his translation was to set aside the
   interpretation of the LXX., in so far as it appeared to support the
   views of the Christian Church.


   This is the story of Epiphanius (de mens. et pond. 14 sq.: labon [sc.
   ho Hadrianos] ton Akulan touton . . . Hellena onta kai hautou
   pentheriden, apo Sinopes de tes Pontou hormomenon, kathistesin auton
   ekeise epistatein tois ergois ktl. . . . pikrantheis de . . .
   proseluteuei kai peritemnetai Ioudaios; kai epiponos philotimesamenos
   exedoken heauton mathein ten Ebraion dialekton kai ta auton stoicheia.
   tauten de akrotata paideutheis hermeneusen ouk ortho logismo
   chresamenos, all' hopos diastrepse tina ton rheton, enskepsas te ton
   ob' hermeneia hina ta peri Christou en tais graphais memarturemena
   allos ekdosei). The same tale is told in substance by the
   Pseudo-Athanasian author of Synopsis script. sacr., c. 77, and in the
   Dialogue between Timothy and Aquila printed in Anecdota Oxon., class.
   ser. pt viii. According to the writer of the Dialogue Aquila learned
   Hebrew in his 40th year, and there are other features peculiar to this
   form of the story which have led the editor, Mr F. C. Conybeare, to
   conjecture that it is independent of the Epiphanian narrative, though
   derived from the same source, which he believes to have been ultimately
   the history of Ariston of Pella (op. cit. p. xxvi. ff.). An Aquila
   figures in the Clementine romance (hom. ii. sqq., recogn. ii. sqq.);
   the name and character were perhaps suggested by some floating memories
   of the translator. Cf. Lagarde, Clementina, p. 12 f.


   That Aquila was a proselyte to Judaism is attested by the Jewish
   tradition (Jer. Talm. Meg. 1. 11, Kidush. 1. 1), in which he appears as
   hgr, ho proselutos [84] . After his conversion to Judaism, Aquila
   became a pupil of R. Eliezer and R. Joshua (Meg. f. 71 c) or, according
   to another authority, of R. Akiba (Kiddush. f. 59 a). The latter
   statement seems to have been current among the Jews of Palestine in
   Jerome's time (Hieron. in Isa. viii, 14 "scribae et Pharisaei quorum
   suscepit scholam Akybas, quem magistrum Aquilae proselyti autumant"),
   and it derives some confirmation from the character of the version.

   According to Epiphanius the floruit of Aquila is to be placed in the
   12th year of Hadrian (Epiph. de mens. et pond. 13 Hadrianos ete ka,
   houtinos to dodekato etei Akulas egnorizeto . . . hos einai apo tou
   chronou tes hermeneias ton ob' hermeneuton heos Akula tou hermeneutou,
   egoun heos dodekatou etous Hadrianou, ete ul' kai menas d'. The 12th
   year of Hadrian was A.D. 128--9, the year in which the Emperor began to
   rebuild Aelia. This date is doubtless approximately correct, if Aquila
   was a pupil of R. Akiba, who taught from A.D. 95 to A.D. 135 [85] , or
   even of R. Eliezer and R. Joshua, who immediately preceded Akiba. It
   must have taken the Greek proselyte many years to acquire an adequate
   knowledge of Hebrew and of the Rabbinical methods of interpretation,
   and under these circumstances his great work could hardly have been
   completed before the fourth decade of the second century. When Irenaeus
   wrote his third book, in the ninth decade, Aquila's translation might
   still be regarded as comparatively recent (ton nun methermeneuein
   tolmonton ten graphen . . . hos . . . Akulas).

   4. It was natural that the version of Aquila should be received with
   acclamation by his co-religionists. His teachers congratulated him in
   the words of Ps. xlv. 3, yphyphyt mbny 'dm ? [86] . The Talmud quotes
   or refers to his translation of not a few passages (Gen. xvii. 1; Lev.
   xix. 20, 23, 40; Esth. i. 6; Prov. xviii. 21, xxv. 11; Isa. iii. 20;
   Ezek. xvi. 10, xxiii. 43; Dan. v. 5, viii. 13). In Origen's time he was
   trusted implicitly in Jewish circles, and used by all Jews who did not
   understand Hebrew (ep. ad African. 2 philotimoteron pepisteumenos para
   Ioudaiois . . . o malista eiothasin hoi agnoountes ten Ebraion
   dialekton chresthai, hos panton mallon epiteteugmeno); and the same
   preference for Aquila seems to have been characteristic of the Jews in
   the fourth and fifth centuries (cf. Jerome on Ezek. iii. 5, and
   Augustine de civ. Dei xv. z3), and at a still later period, for even
   Justinian, when regulating the public reading of the Scriptures in the
   synagogues, thought it expedient to permit the use of Aquila (novell.
   146: "at vero ii qui Graeca lingua legunt LXX. interpretum utentur
   translatione . . . verum . . . licentiam concedimus etiam Aquilae
   versione utendi"). It was equally natural that the proselyte's version
   should be regarded with distrust by Christians, who saw in it the work
   of a champion of Rabbinism as well as a bold attempt to displace the
   Septuagint [87] . Yet the few Christian writers who were students of
   the Hebrew Bible learnt to recognise the fidelity of Aquila's work. He
   was 'a slave to the letter' (douleuon te Ebraike lexei; whatever was
   wanting in the Hebrew text was not to be found in Aquila ou keitai para
   tois Ebraiois, dioper oude para to Akula). So Origen confesses [88] ;
   and Jerome, though when in a censorious mood he does not spare the
   proselyte (e.g. praef. in Job, ep. ad Pammach.), elsewhere admits his
   honesty and diligence (ep. ad Damas. 12 "non contentiosius, ut quidam
   putant, sed studiosius verbum interpretatur ad verbum"; ep. ad Marcell.
   "iamdudum cum voluminibus Hebraeorum editionem Aquilae confero, ne quid
   forsitan propter odium Christi synagoga mutaverit, et--ut amicae menti
   fatear--quae ad nostram fidem pertineant roborandam plura reperio").
   After these testimonies from the two most competent witnesses in the
   ancient Church, we need not stop to consider the invective of
   Epiphanius [89] .

   5. Until the summer of 1897 Aquila's version was known to students only
   from the description of ancient writers, chiefly Christian, and the
   fragments of the Hexapla (c. iii.), which when complete contained the
   entire work. These sources were used with admirable skill by Dr Field
   (prolegomena in Hexapla, p. xix, ff.) and Dr C. Taylor (D. C. B. art.
   Hexapla) to illustrate the purpose and style of Aquila's work. But an
   unexpected discovery has since placed at our disposal several larger
   fragments of the version, emanating from a Jewish source. Among the
   débris of the Genizah of the Cairo synagogue brought to Cambridge in
   1897 through the efforts of Dr Taylor and Dr Schechter, Professor
   Burkitt was so fortunate as to discover some palimpsest scraps which
   under later Hebrew writing contain in a good uncial hand of the sixth
   century Aquila's translation of 1 Kings xx. 9--17 and 2 Kings xxiii.
   12--27 [90] . From the same treasure Dr Taylor recovered portions of
   Pss. xc.-ciii., and a Hexaplar fragment of Ps. xxii. [91] The student
   will find below specimens of these discoveries, placed for the purpose
   of comparison in parallel columns with the version of the LXX.

   6. If the student examines these specimens of Aquila's work and
   compares them with the Hebrew and LXX., the greater literalness of the
   later version and several of its most striking peculiarities will at
   once be apparent. He will notice especially the following. (1) There
   are frequent instances of an absolutely literal rendering of the
   original, e.g. 1 Kings xx. 10 hos en posin mou = 'sr brgly (LXX. tois
   pezois mou); 12 thete;kai ethekan = symv vysymv (LXX. oikodomesate
   charaka, kai ethento charaka); 2 Kings xxiii. 21 to legein = l'mr (LXX.
   legon); 24 ha horathesan =
   'sr nr'v (LXX. ta gegonota). (2) Under certain circumstances [99] sun
   is employed to represent the Hebrew 't, when it is the sign of the
   accusative [100] ; e.g. 1 Kings xx. 12 sun to rhema = 'thdvr?, 13 sun
   panta ton ochlon = 'tklhhmvn?, 2 Kings xxiii. 21 sun panti to lao
   (where the dat. is governed by the preceding verb), 24 sun tous magous
   ktl. (3) The same Hebrew words are scrupulously rendered by the same
   Greek, e.g. kai kaige = vgm occurs thrice in one context (2 Kings
   xxiii. 15, 19, 24); and in Ps. xcii. 8, 10 katergazomenoi anopheles
   twice represents ply 'vn? (4) The transliterations adhere with greater
   closeness to the Hebrew than in the LXX. [101] ; thus pmch becomes
   phesa, y'syhv Iosiaou, chlqyhv Helkiaou. (5) The Tetragrammaton is not
   transliterated, but written in Hebrew letters, and the characters are
   of the archaic type ( , not yhvh); cf. Orig. in Ps. ii., kai en tois
   akribestatois de ton antigraphon Ebraiois charaktersin keitai to onoma,
   Ebraikois de ou tois nun alla tois archaiotatois--where the 'most exact
   copies' are doubtless those of Aquila's version, for there is no reason
   to suppose that any copyists of the Alexandrian version hesitated to
   write o ks or ke for yhvh? [102] . (6) That the crudities of Aquila's
   style are not due to an insufficient vocabulary [103] is clear from his
   ready use of words belonging to the classical or the literary type when
   they appear to him to correspond to the Hebrew more closely than the
   colloquialisms of the LXX. The following are specimens; 1 Kings xx. 10
   LXX. ekpoiesei, Aq. exarkesei; LXX. alopexin, Aq. lichasin [104] ; 12
   LXX. skenais, Aq. suskiasmois; 2 Kings xxiii. 21 LXX. diathekes, Aq.
   sunthekes; 24 LXX. theraphein, Aq. morphomata; LXX. eidola, Aq.
   katharmata; Ps. xc. 8 LXX. antapodosin, Aq. apotisin; ib. 10 LXX.
   proseleusetai, Aq. metachthesetai; LXX. mastix, Aq. haphe; xci. 5 LXX.
   poiemati, Aq. katergo.

   From the fragments which survive in the margins of hexaplaric MSS. it
   is possible to illustrate certain other characteristic features of
   Aquila which arise out of his extreme loyalty to the letter of his
   Hebrew text. (1) Jerome remarks upon his endeavour to represent even
   the etymological meaning of the Hebrew words (ad Pammach. 11 "non solum
   verba sed etymologias quoque verborum transferre conatus est)," and by
   way of example he cites the rendering of Deut. vii. 13, where Aquila
   substituted cheuma, oporismon, stilpnoteta for siton, oinon, elaion in
   order to reflect more exactly the Hebrew ytshr ,tyrs ,dgn--as though,
   adds Jerome humorously, we were to use in Latin fusio, pomatio,
   splendentia. Similarly, Aquila represented tsm by osteoun, and hskyl by
   epistemonizein or epistemonoun, and even coined the impossible form
   haphemenos to correspond with ngv?. (2) An attempt is made to represent
   Hebrew particles, even such as defy translation; thus h local becomes
   the enclitic de (e. g. notonde = hngbh, Gen. xii. 9, Kurenende = qyrh?,
   2 Kings xvi. 9); and similarly prepositions are accumulated in a manner
   quite alien from Greek usage (e.g. eis apo makrothen = lmrchvq?, 2
   Kings xix. 25). (3) Other devices are adopted for the purpose of
   bringing the version into close conformity with the original; a word of
   complex meaning or form is represented by two Greek words (e.g. z'zl is
   converted into tragos apoluomenos and tsltsl into skia skia; a Hebrew
   word is replaced by a Greek word somewhat similar in sound, e.g. for
   'lvn (Deut. xi. 30) Aquila gives aulon, and for trphym ? (1 Sam. xv.
   23) therapeia [105] .

   Enough has been said to shew the absurdity of Aquila's method when it
   is regarded from the standpoint of the modern translator. Even in
   ancient times such a translation could never have attained to the
   popularity which belonged to the LXX.; that it was widely accepted by
   the Greek synagogues of the Empire can only have been due to the
   prejudice created in its favour by its known adherence to the standard
   text and the traditional exegesis [106] . The version of Aquila
   emanated from a famous school of Jewish teachers; it was issued with
   the full approval of the Synagogue, and its affectation of preserving
   at all costs the idiom of the original recommended it to orthodox Jews
   whose loyalty to their faith was stronger than their sense of the
   niceties of the Greek tongue. For ourselves the work of Aquila
   possesses a value which arises from another consideration. His "high
   standard of exactitude and rigid consistency give his translation, with
   all its imperfections, unique worth for the critic [107] ." Its
   importance for the criticism of the Old Testament was fully recognised
   by the two greatest scholars of ancient Christendom, and there are few
   things more to be desired by the modern student of Scripture than the
   complete recovery of this monument of the text and methods of
   interpretation approved by the chief Jewish teachers of the generation
   which followed the close of the Apostolic age.

   7. Theodotion. With Aquila Irenaeus couples Theodotion of Ephesus, as
   another Jewish proselyte who translated the Old Testament into Greek
   (Theodotion hermecheusen ho Ephesios kai Akulas . . . amphoteroi
   Ioudaioi proselutoi). Himself of Asiatic origin, and probably a junior
   contemporary of Theodotion, Irenaeus may be trusted when he assigns
   this translator to Ephesus, and describes him as a convert to Judaism.
   Later writers, however, depart more or less widely from this statement.
   According to Epiphanius, Theodotion was a native of Pontus, who had
   been a disciple of Marcion of Sinope before he espoused Judaism.
   According to Jerome, he was an Ebionite, probably a Jew who had
   embraced Ebionitic Christianity. His floruit is fixed by Epiphanius in
   the reign of the second Commodus, i.e. of the Emperor Commodes, so
   called to distinguish him from L. Ceionius Commodus, better known as L.
   Aurelius Verus.

   54 "editiones . . . Aquilae . . . Pontici proselyti et Theodotionis
   Hebionaei"; praef. ad Daniel.: "Theodotionem, qui utique post adventum
   Christi incredulus fuit, licet eum quidam dicant Hebionitam qui altero
   genere Iudaeus est [108] ."

   The date assigned to Theodotion by Epiphanius is obviously too late, in
   view of the statement of Irenaeus, and the whole account suspiciously
   resembles the story of Aquila. That within the same century two natives
   of Pontus learnt Hebrew as adults, and used their knowledge to produce
   independent translations of the Hebrew Bible, is scarcely credible. But
   it is not unlikely that Theodotion was an Ephesian Jew or Jewish
   Ebionite. The attitude of a Hellenist towards the Alexandrian version
   would naturally be one of respectful consideration, and his view of the
   office of a translator widely different from that of Aquila, who had
   been trained by the strictest Rabbis of the Palestinian school. And
   these expectations are justified by what we know of Theodotion's work.
   "Inter veteres medius incedit" (Hieron. praef. ad evang.);
   "simplicitate sermonis a LXX. interpretibus non discordat" (praef. in
   Pss.); "Septuaginta et Theodotio . . . in plurimis locis concordant"
   (in Eccl. ii.)--such is Jerome's judgement; and Epiphanius agrees with
   this estimate (de mens. et pond. 17: ta pleista tois ob' sunadontos
   exedoken). Theodotion seems to have produced a free revision of the
   LXX. rather than an independent version. The revision was made on the
   whole upon the basis of the standard Hebrew text; thus the Job of
   Theodotion was longer than the Job of the LXX. by a sixth part of the
   whole (Orig. ep. ad Afric. 3 sqq., Hieron. praef. ad Job) [109] , and
   in Daniel, on the other hand, the Midrashic expansions which
   characterise the LXX. version disappear in Theodotion. His practice
   with regard to apocryphal books or additional matter appears not to
   have been uniform; he followed the LXX. in accepting the additions to
   Daniel and the supplementary verses in Job [110] , but there is no
   evidence that he admitted the non-canonical books in general [111] .

   8. Specimens of Theodotion's style and manner may be obtained from the
   large and important fragments of his work which were used by Origen to
   fill up the lacunae in Jeremiah (LXX.). The following passage,
   preserved in the margin of Codex Marchalianus, will serve as an example
   [112] .


   Jeremiah xl. (xxxiii.) 14--26.

   Unfortunately there is no other Greek version which can be compared
   with Theodotion in this passage, for the LXX. is wanting, and only a
   few shreds of Aquila and Symmachus have reached us. But the student
   will probably agree with Field that the style is on the whole not
   wanting in simple dignity, and that it is scarcely to be distinguished
   from the best manner of the LXX. [114] With his Hebrew Bible open at
   the place, he will observe that the rendering is faithful to the
   original, while it escapes the crudities and absurdities which beset
   the excessive fidelity of Aquila. Now and again we meet with a word
   unknown to the LXX. (e.g. akribasmata = chqvt?) [115] , or a
   reminiscence of Aquila; on the other hand Theodotion agrees with the
   LXX. against Aquila in translating bryt by diatheke. If in one place
   Theodotion is more obscure than Aquila ten diatheken ten hemeran . . .
   ten nukta, Aq. tes hemeras . . . tes nuktos), yet the passage as a
   whole is a singularly clear and unaffected rendering. His chief defect
   does not reveal itself in this context; it is a habit of
   transliterating Hebrew words which could have presented no difficulty
   to a person moderately acquainted with both languages. Field gives a
   list of 90 words which are treated by Theodotion in this way without
   any apparent cause [116] . When among these we find such a word as 'l
   (which is represented by el in Mal. ii. 11), we are compelled to
   absolve him from the charge of incompetence, for, as has been
   pertinently asked, how could a man who was unacquainted with so
   ordinary a word or with its Greek equivalent have produced a version at
   all? Probably an explanation should be sought in the cautious and
   conservative temperament of this translator [117] . Field's judgement
   is here sounder than Montfaucon's; Theodotion is not to be pronounced
   indoctior, or indiligentior, but only "scrupulosior quam operis sui
   instituto fortasse conveniret [118] ."

   9. The relation of the two extant Greek versions of Daniel is a
   perplexing problem which calls for further consideration. In his lost
   Stromata Origen, it appears [119] , announced his intention of using
   Theodotion's version of Daniel; and an examination of Origen's extant
   works shews that his citations of Daniel "agree almost verbatim with
   the text of Theodotion now current [120] ." The action of Origen in
   this matter was generally endorsed by the Church, as we learn from
   Jerome (praef. in Dan.: "Danielem prophetam iuxta LXX. interpretes
   ecclesiae non legunt, utentes Theodotionis editione"; cf. c. Rufin. ii.
   33). Jerome did not know how this happened, but his own words supply a
   sufficient explanation: "hoc unum affirmare possum quod multum a
   veritate discordet et recto iudicio repudiata sit." So universal was
   the rejection of the LXX. version of Daniel that, though Origen loyally
   gave it a place in his Hexapla, only one Greek copy has survived [121]
   , Theodotion's version having been substituted in all other extant
   Greek MSS. of Daniel.

   But the use of Theodotion's Daniel in preference to the version which
   was attributed to the LXX. did not begin with Origen. Clement of
   Alexandria (as edited) uses Theodotion, with a sprinkling of LXX.
   readings, in the few places where he quotes Daniel (paed. ii. 8, iii.
   3, strom. i. 4, 21). In North Africa both versions seem to have
   influenced the Latin text of Daniel. The subject has been carefully
   investigated by Prof. F. C. Burkitt [122] , who shews that Tertullian
   used "a form of the LXX. differing slightly from Origen's edition,"
   whilst Cyprian quotes from a mixed text, in which Theodotion sometimes
   predominates. Irenaeus, notwithstanding his reverence for the LXX. and
   distrust of the later versions, cites Daniel after Theodotion's version
   [123] . Further, Theodotion's Daniel appears to be used by writers
   anterior to the date usually assigned to this translator. Thus Hermas
   (vis. iv. 2, 4) has a clear reference to Theodotion's rendering of Dan.
   vi. 22 [124] . Justin (dial. 31) gives a long extract from Dan. vii. in
   which characteristic readings from the two versions occur in almost
   equal proportions [125] . Clement of Rome (1 Cor. 34) cites a part of
   the same context, with a Theodotionic reading (eleitourgoun, LXX.
   ethera?euon). Barnabas (ep. iv. 5) also refers to Dan. vii., and,
   though his citation is too loose to be pressed, the words
   exanastesontai opisthen auton are more likely to be a reminiscence of
   opiso auton anastesetai (Th.) than of meta toutous stesetai (LXX.). The
   Greek version of Baruch (i. 15--18, ii. 11--19) undoubtedly supports
   Theodotion against the LXX. Still more remarkable is the appearance of
   Theodotionic renderings in the New Testament. A writer so faithful to
   the LXX. as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in his only
   reference to Daniel Heb. xi. 33 = Dan. vi. 23) agrees with Theodotion
   against the Chigi version [126] . The Apocalypse, which makes frequent
   use of Daniel, supports Theodotion on the whole; cf. Apoc. ix. 20 (Dan.
   v. 23), x. 6 (Dan. xii. 7), xii. 7 (Dan. x. 20), xiii. 7 (Dan. vii.
   21), xix. 6 (Dan. x. 6), xx. 4 (Dan. vii. 9), xx. 11 (Dan. ii. 35)
   [127] . Even in the Synoptic Gospels Theodotion's rendering in Dan.
   vii. 13 (meta ton nephelon) occurs as well as the LXX. epi ton n. comp.
   Mc. xiv. 62 with Mt. xxiv. 30, xxvi. 64 [128] .

   From these premisses the inference has been drawn that there were two
   pre-Christian versions of Daniel, both passing as 'LXX.', one of which
   is preserved in the Chigi MS., whilst the other formed the basis of
   Theodotion's revision [129] . It has been urged by Dr Gwynn with much
   acuteness that the two Septuagintal Books of Esdras offer an analogy to
   the two versions of Daniel, and the appearance of the phrase apereisato
   auta en to eidolio autou in 1 Esdr. ii. 9 and Dan. i. 2 (LXX.) has been
   regarded as an indication that the Greek Esdras and the Chigi Daniel
   were the work of the same translator [130] . An obvious objection to
   the hypothesis of two Septuagintal or Alexandrian versions is the
   entire disappearance of the version which was used ex hypothesi not
   only by the authors of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Apocalypse,
   but by Theodotion and other writers of the second century. But
   Theodotion's revision of Daniel may have differed so little from the
   stricter Alexandrian version as to have taken its place without remark
   [131] .

   10. Symmachus. Of this translator Irenaeus says nothing, and it has
   been inferred, perhaps too hastily, that he was unknown to the Bishop
   of Lyons, and of later date. Origen knew and used Symmachus, and had
   received a copy of his commentary on St Matthew from a wealthy
   Christian woman named Juliana, to whom it had been given by the author.
   According to Eusebius, Symmachus was an Ebionite, and this is confirmed
   by Jerome; a less probable tradition in Epiphanius represents him as a
   Samaritan who had become a convert to Judaism [132] .

     Eus. H. E. vi. 17 ton ge men hermeneuuon auton de touton isteon
     Ebionaion ton Summachon gegonenai . . . kai hupomnemata de tou
     Summachou eiseti nun pheretai en hois dokei pros to kata Matthaion

     54 "Theodotionis Hebionaei et Symmachi eiusdem dogmatis" (cf. in
     Hab. iii. 13); praef. in Job: "Symmachus et Theodotion Iudaizantes
     haeretici." Epiph. de mens. et pond. 15 en tois tou Seuerou chronois

     peritomen . . . houtos toinun ho Summachos pros diastrophen ton para
     Samareitais hermeneion hermeneusas ten triten exedoken hermeneian.

   That Symmachus, even if of Jewish or Samaritan birth, became an
   Ebionite leader is scarcely doubtful, since an Ebionitic commentary on
   St Matthew bearing his name was still extant in the fourth century
   [133] ; the Symmachians, an Ebionite sect probably named after him, are
   mentioned by Ambrosiaster (comm. in Gal., prolegg.) and Augustine (c.
   Faust. xix. 4, c. Crescon. i. 36) [134] . His floruit is open to some
   question. Dr Gwynn has shewn [135] that Epiphanius, who makes
   Theodotion follow Symmachus, probably placed Symmachus in the reign of
   Verus, i.e. Marcus Aurelius. Now in the Historia Lausiaca, c. 147,
   Palladius says that Juliana sheltered Origen during a persecution, i.e.
   probably during the persecution of the Emperor Maximius (A.D.
   238--241). If this was so, the literary activity of Symmachus must have
   belonged, at the earliest, to the last years of M. Aurelius, and it may
   be questioned whether Epiphanius has not inverted the order of the two
   translators, i.e. whether Theodotion ought not to be placed under M.
   Aurelius and Symmachus under Commodus (A.D. 180--192) [136] . The
   version of Symmachus was in the hands of Origen when he wrote his
   earliest commentaries, i.e. about A.D. 228 [137] ; but the interval is
   long enough to admit of its having reached Alexandria.

   11. The aim of Symmachus, as Jerome perceived, was to express the sense
   of his Hebrew text rather than to attempt a verbal rendering: "non
   solet verborum kakozelian sed intellegentiae ordinem sequi" (in Am.
   iii. 11). While Aquila endeavoured "verbum de verbo exprimere,"
   Symmachus made it his business "sensum potius sequi" (praef. in Chron.
   Eus., cf. praef. in Job). Epiphanius, who believed Symmachus to have
   been a Samaritan proselyte to Judaism, jumped to the conclusion that
   his purpose was polemical (pros diastrophen ton para Samareitais
   hermeneion hermeneusas). But if Symmachus had any antagonist in view,
   it was probably the literalism and violation of the Greek idiom which
   made the work of Aquila unacceptable to non-Jewish readers. So far as
   we can judge from the fragments of his version which survive in
   Hexaplaric MSS., he wrote with Aquila's version before him, and in his
   efforts to recast it made free use of both the LXX. and Theodotion. The
   following extracts will serve to illustrate this view of his relation
   to his predecessors.


   MALACHI II. 13 [138]


   LXX. Aq.
   kai tauta ha emisoun epoieite; ekaluptete dakrusin to thusiasterion
   Kuriou kai klauthmo kai stenagmo ek kopon. eti axion epiblepsai eis
   thusian e labein dekton ek ton cheiron humon kai touto deuteron
   epoieite; ekaluptete dakruo to thusiasterion klauthmo kai oimoge, apo
   tou me einai eti neusai pros to doron kai labein eudokian apo cheiros
   humon.
   Th. Symm.

   oimossontes, apo tou me einai eti neuonta pros to doron kai dexasthai
   to eudokemenon apo cheiros humon.


   But it must not be supposed that Symmachus is a mere reviser of earlier
   versions, or that he follows the lead of Aquila as Theodotion follows
   the LXX. Again and again he goes his own way in absolute independence
   of earlier versions, and sometimes at least, it must be confessed, of
   the original. This is due partly to his desire to produce a good Greek
   rendering, more or less after the current literary style; partly, as it
   seems, to dogmatic reasons. The following may serve as specimens of the
   Greek style of Symmachus when he breaks loose from the influence of his
   predecessors: Gen. xviii. 25 ho panta anthropon apaiton dikaiopragein,
   alritos me poieses touto; Job xxvi. 14 ti de psithurisma ton logon
   autou akousomen, hopou bronten dunasteias autou oudeis ennoesei; Ps.
   xliii. 16 di holes hemeras he aschemonesis mou antikrus mou, kai ho
   kataischummos tou prosopou mou kaluptei me. Ps. lxviii. 3 ebaptisthen
   eis aperantous kataduseis, kai ouk estin stasis; eiselthon eis ta bathe
   ton hudaton, kai rheithron epeklusen me. Eccl. iv. 9 eisin ameinous duo
   henos; echousin gar kerdos agathon. Isa. xxix. 4 upo gen
   edaphisthesetai he lalia sou, kai estai hos engastrimuthos he phone pou
   kai apo tes ges he lalia sou rhoisetai.

   It cannot be said that these renderings approach to excellence, but a
   comparison with the corresponding LXX. will shew that Symmachus has at
   least attempted to set himself free from the trammels of the Hebrew
   idiom and to clothe the thoughts of the Old Testament in the richer
   drapery of the Greek tongue. It is his custom to use compounds to
   represent ideas which in Hebrew can be expressed only by two or more
   words (e.g. blyphs, Symm. anaitios, yn ?byn, Symm. hophthalmophanos,
   lr's pnh Symm. akrogoniaios); he converts into a participle the first
   of two finite verbs connected by a copula (Exod. v. 7 Symm.
   aperchomenoi kalamasthosan, 4 Regn. i. 2 sphalentes epeson); he has at
   his command a large supply of Greek particles (e.g. he renders 'k by
   ara, ontos, isos, di holou, monon, houtos, all' homos) [139] . More
   interesting and important is the tendency which Symmachus manifests to
   soften the anthropomorphic expressions of the Old Testament; e.g. Gen.
   i. 27, ektisen ho theos ton anthropon en eikoni diaphoro [140] ;
   orthion ho theos ektisen auton. Exod. xxiv. 10, eidon horamati ton
   theon Israel. Jud. ix. 13 ton oinon . . . ten euphrosunen ton
   anthropon. Ps. xliii. 24 hina ti hos hupnon ei, Despota; In these and
   other instances Symmachus seems to shew a knowledge of current Jewish
   exegesis [141] which agrees with the story of his Jewish origin or
   training.

   12. Other ancient Greek versions. The researches of Origen (A.D.
   185--253) brought to light three anonymous versions besides those of
   Aquila, Theodotion and Symmachus; from their relative position in the
   columns of his great collection (see c. iii.) they are known as the
   Quinta (e'), Sexta (s'), and Septima (z') respectively. The following
   are the chief authorities:

     septimam editionem, quas etiam nos de eius bibliotheca habemus, miro
     labore repperit et cum ceteris editionibus conparavit": in ep. ad
     Tit. "nonnulli vero libri, et maxime hi qui apud Hebraeos versu
     compositi sunt, tres alias editiones additas habent quam 'quintam'
     et 'sextam' et 'septimam' translationem vocant, auctoritatem sine
     nominibus interpretum consecutas." Cf. in Hab. ii. 11, iii. 13.

   It appears from the statement of Eusebius [142] that Origen found the
   Quinta at Nicopolis near Actium, and that either the Sexta or the
   Septima was discovered in the reign of Caracalla (A.D. 211--217) at
   Jericho; while Epiphanius, reversing this order, says that the Quinta
   was found at Jericho c. A.D. 217, and the Sexta at Nicopolis under
   Severus Alexander (A.D. 222--235) [143] . According to Epiphanius both
   the Quinta and the Sexta, according to Eusebius the Sexta only, lay
   buried in a pithos (dolium), one of the earthenware jars, pitched
   internally, and partly sunk in the ground, in which the mustum was
   usually stored while it underwent the process of fermentation [144] .
   Since Origen was in Palestine A.D. 217, and in Greece A.D. 231, it is
   natural to connect his discoveries with those years. How long the
   versions had been buried cannot be determined, for it is impossible to
   attach any importance to the vague statements of Eusebius (ton palai
   lanthanousas chronon). The version found at or near Nicopolis may have
   been a relic of the early Christianity of Epirus, to which there is an
   indirect allusion in the Pastoral Epistles [145] . The Jericho find, on
   the other hand, was very possibly a Palestinian work, deposited in the
   wine jar for the sake of safety during the persecution of Septimius
   Severus, who was in Palestine A.D. 202, and issued edicts against both
   the Synagogue and the Church [146] . Of Septima nothing is known,
   beyond what Eusebius tells us, and the very sparing use of it in the
   Psalter of some Hexaplaric MSS.; the few instances are so dubious that
   Field was disposed to conclude either that this version never existed,
   or that all traces of it have been lost [147] .

   There is no conclusive evidence to shew that any of these versions
   covered the whole of the Old Testament [148] . Renderings from Quinta
   [149] are more or less abundant in 2 Kings, Job, Psalms, Canticles, and
   the Minor Prophets, and a few traces have been observed in the
   Pentateuch. Sexta is well represented in the Psalms and in Canticles,
   and has left indications of its existence in Exodus, 1 Kings, and the
   Minor Prophets.

   With regard to the literary character of Quinta and Sexta, the style of
   Quinta is characterised by Field as "omnium elegantissimus . . . cum
   optimis Graecis suae aetatis scriptoribus comparandus." Sexta also
   shews some command of Greek, but is said to be disposed to paraphrase;
   Field, while he regards that charge as on the whole 'not proven,' cites
   a remarkable example of the tendency from Ps. xxxvi. 35, which s'
   renders, Eidon asebe kai anaide antipoioumenon en skleroteti kai
   legonta Eimi hos autochthon peripaton en dikaiosune. Jerome [150]
   attributes both versions to 'Jewish translators,' but the Christian
   origin of Sexta betrays itself [151] at Hab. iii. 13 exelthes tou sosai
   ton laon sou dia Iesoun ton christon sou [152] .

   The Greek fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries quotes
   non-Septuagintal renderings from an interpreter who is styled ho
   Ebraios. Ho Suros is also cited, frequently as agreeing with ho
   Ebraios. Nothing is known of these translators (if such they were), but
   an elaborate discussion of all the facts may be seen in Field [153] .

   13. The 'GRAECUS VENETUS.' This is a version of the Pentateuch,
   together with the books of Ruth, Proverbs, Canticles, Ecclesiastes,
   Lamentations, and Daniel, preserved in St Mark's Library at Venice in a
   single MS. of cent. xiv.--xv. (cod. Gr. vii.) [154] . It was first
   given to the world by de Villoison (Strassburg, 1784) and C. F. Ammon
   (Erlangen, 1790--1); a new edition with valuable prolegomena by O. von
   Gebhardt appeared at Leipzig in 1875 [155] . This translation has been
   made directly from the M. T., but the author appears to have
   occasionally availed himself of earlier Greek versions (LXX., Aq.,
   Symm., Theod.) [156] . His chief guide however appears to have been
   David Kimchi, whose interpretations are closely followed [157] . That
   he was a Jew is clear from incidental renderings (e.g. in Exod. xxiii.
   20 he translates hmqvm ton ontoten [158] , sc. yhvh). From the fact of
   his having undertaken a Greek version Gebhardt infers that he was a
   proselyte to Christianity, but the argument may be used to support an
   opposite conclusion; as a Jew he may have been moved by a desire to
   place before the dominant Orthodox Church a better rendering of the Old
   Testament than the LXX. Delitzsch wishes to identify him with
   Elissaeus, a Jewish scholar at the court of Murad I., who flourished in
   the second half of the 14th century.

   The style of this remarkable version will be best illustrated by a few
   specimens:


   Gen. vi. 2 f.


   ^2 tetheantai goun hoi huieis tou theou tas thugateras tou anthrhopou
   hoti kalai eteloun, kai elaron heautois gunaikas apo pason on heilonto.
   ^3 ephe toinun ho ontotes Ou krinei pneuma toumon en to anthropo es
   aiona, eph' hois eti per esti sarx; telesousi d' hai hemerai autou
   hekaton kai eikosin ete.


   Prov. viii. 22 ff.


   ^22 ho ontotes ektesato me archen hodou hoi, pro ton ergon autou ek
   tote. ^23 ap' aionos kechumai, apo kratos, apo prolemmatos ges. ^24 en
   ouk abussois peplasmai, en ou pegais dedoxasmenon hudaton; ^25 prin ore
   empagenai, pro ton bounon hodinemai; ^26 achris ouk epoiese gen,
   diodous kai kephalen koneon tes oikoumenes.


   Daniel vii. 13.


   ^13 horaon ekuresa en horasesin euphronas, autika te xun tais nephelais
   ton polon hos huieus anthropo aphiknoumenos een, mechri te to palaio
   tais hamerais ephthase kanopion teno prosegagon he. ^14 teno t' edothe
   archa tima te kai basileia, pantes te laoi ethnea kai glottai teno
   latreuseionti; ha archu heu archa aionos hos ou pareleuseietai, ha te
   basileia heu haper ouk oicheseietai.


   The student will not fail to notice the translator's desire to render
   his text faithfully, and, on the other hand, his curiously infelicitous
   attempt to reproduce it in Attic Greek; and lastly his use of the Doric
   dialect in Daniel to distinguish the Aramaic passages from the rest of
   the book. The result reminds us of a schoolboy's exercise, and the
   reader turns from it with pleasure to the less ambitious diction of the
   LXX., which, with its many imperfections, is at least the natural
   outgrowth of historical surroundings.

     Klostermann (Analecta p. 30) mentions a MS. Psalter (Vat. Gr. 343),
     bearing the date 22 April, 1450, which professes to be a translation
     into the Greek of the fifteenth century (kata ten nun koinen ton
     Graikon phonen). A version of the Pentateuch into modern Greek in
     Hebrew characters was printed at Constantinople in 1547, forming the
     left-hand column of a Polyglott (Hebrew, Chaldee, Spanish, Greek).
     It is described in Wolf, Bibliotheca Hebraea, ii. p. 355, and more
     fully in La version Neo-grecque du Pentateuche Polyglotte . . .
     remarques du Dr Lasare Belléli (Paris, 1897). This Greek version has
     recently been transliterated and published in a separate form with
     an introduction and glossary by D. C. Hesseling (Leide, 1897). A
     Greek version of job (1576) is mentioned by Neubauer in J. Q. R. iv.
     p. 18 f.

   [102] In a few Hexaplaric MSS. (e.g. Q, 86, 88, 243mg, 264) the Greek
   letters PIPI are written for yhvh, but (with the exception of the
   Genizah Palimpsest, Taylor, p. 27) the Greek MSS. use it solely in
   their excerpts from the non-Septuagintal columns of the Hexapla, and
   only the Hexaplaric Syriac admits PIPI into the text of the LXX., using
   it freely for kurios, even with a preposition (as ). Oxyrh. Pap. 1007
   (vol. VII.), late 3rd cent., has ZZ, representing doubled yod, in Gen.
   ii., iii. Ceriani expresses the opinion that the use of PIPI is due
   either to Origen or Eusebius, i.e. one of those fathers substituted
   PIPI for for in the non-Septuagintal columns, using the letters to
   represent the Hebrew characters which were familiar to them. On the
   whole subject the student may consult Ceriani, Monumenta sacra et
   profane, ii. p. 106 ff.; Schleusner, s.v. pipi, Field, Hexapla ad Esa.
   i. 2; Hatch and Redpath, Concordance, p. 1135; Driver in Studia Biblia,

   acutely points out (p. 16) that (and doubtless also PIPI was read as
   Kurios, since in one place in the Aquila fragments where there was no
   room to write the Hebrew characters "instead of oiko we find oiko ku."

   a second edition of Aquila "quam Hebraei kat' akribeian nominant." The

  CHAPTER III.

    THE HEXAPLA, AND THE HEXAPLARIC AND OTHER RECENSIONS OF THE SEPTUAGINT.


   1. THE century which produced the versions of Aquila, Theodotion, and
   Symmachus saw also the birth of the great Christian scholar who
   conceived the idea of using them for the revision of the Alexandrian
   Greek Bible.

   Origen was in his 17th year when his father suffered martyrdom (A.D.
   202) [159] ; at eighteen he was already head of the catechetical school
   of Alexandria [160] . The Old Testament from the first engaged his
   attention, and, rightly judging that it could not be fruitfully studied
   without a knowledge of the original, he applied himself at once to the
   study of Hebrew.

     Eus. H. E. vi. 16 tosaute de eisegeto to Origenei ton theion logon
     apekribomene exet?sis, hos kai ten Ebraida glottan ekmathein tas te
     para tois Ioudaiois empheromenas prototupous autois Ebraion
     stoicheiois graphas ktema idion poiesasthai. Hieron. de virr. ill.
     54 "quis autem ignorat quod tantum in scripturis divinis habuerit
     studii ut etiam Hebraeam linguam contra aetatis gentisque suae
     naturam edisceret [161] ?"

   The feat was perhaps without precedent, in the third century, among
   Christian scholars not of Jewish origin [162] ; in one so young it
   seemed prodigious to a veteran like Jerome. These studies, begun in
   Egypt, were continued in Palestine at Caesarea, where Origen sought
   shelter during the storm of persecution which burst upon Alexandria in
   the reign of Caracalla (A.D. 216--219). On his return to Egypt Origen's
   period of literary productivity began, and between the years 220 and
   250 he gave to the world a succession of commentaries, homilies, or
   notes on nearly all the books of the Old Testament [163] . In the
   course of these labours, perhaps from the moment that he began to read
   the Old Testament in the original, he was impressed with the importance
   of providing the Church with materials for ascertaining the true text
   and meaning of the original. The method which he adopted is described
   by himself in his famous letter to Africanus (c. A.D. 240), and more
   fully in his commentary on St Matthew (c. A.D. 245) [164] .

     Orig. ad Afric. 5: kai tauta de phemi houchi okno tou ereunan kai
     tas kata Ioudaious graphas kai pasas tas hemeteras tais ekeinon
     sunkrinein kai horan tas en autais diaphoras, ei me phortikon goun
     eipein, epi polu touto (hose dunamis) pepoiekamen, gumnazontes auton
     ton noun en pasais tais ekdosesi kai tais diaphorais auton meta tou
     posos mallon askein ten hermeneian ton hebdomekonta . . . askoumen
     de me agnoein kai tas par ekeinois, hina pros Ioudaious dialegomenoi
     me prospheromen autois ta me keimena en tois antigraphois auton, kai
     hina sunchresometha tois pheromenois par ekeinois, ei kai en tois
     hemeterois ou keitai bibliois. In Matt. xv. 14: ten men oun en tois
     antigraphois tes palaias diathekes diaphonian, theou didontos,
     heuromen iasasthai, kriterio chresamenoi tais loipais ekdosesin; ton
     gar amphiballomenon para tois o' dia ten ton antigraphon diaphonian,
     ten krisin poiesamenoi apo ton loipon ekdoseon, to sunadon ekeinais

     tolmontes auta pante perielein, tina de met' asteriskon

     boulomenos proetai auta; ho de proskoptei to toiouton, ho bouletai
     peri tes paradoches auton e me poiese.

   2. To attempt a new version was impracticable. It may be doubted
   whether Origen possessed the requisite knowledge of Hebrew; it is
   certain that he would have regarded the task as almost impious. Writing
   to Africanus he defends the apocryphal additions to Daniel and other
   Septuagintal departures from the Hebrew text on the ground that the
   Alexandrian Bible had received the sanction of the Church, and that to
   reject its testimony would be to revolutionise her canon of the Old
   Testament, and to play into the hands of her Jewish adversaries
   athetein ta en tais ekklesiais pheromena antigrapha kai nomothetesai te
   adelphoteti apothesthai men tas par autois epipheromenas biblous,
   kolakeuein de Ioudaiois kai peithein hina metadosin hemin ton
   katharon). In this matter it was well, he urged, to bear in mind the
   precept of Prov. xxii. 28, "Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy
   fathers have set." The same reasons prevented him from adopting any of
   the other versions in place of the Septuagint. On the other hand,
   Origen held that Christians must be taught frankly to recognise the
   divergences between the LXX. and the current Hebrew text, and the
   superiority of Aquila and the other, later versions, in so far as they
   were more faithful to the original; it was unfair to the Jew to quote
   against him passages from the LXX. which were wanting in his own Bible,
   and injurious to the Church herself to withhold from her anything in
   the Hebrew Bible which the LXX. did not represent. Acting under these
   convictions Origen's first step was to collect all existing Greek
   versions of the Old Testament. He then proceeded to transcribe the
   versions in parallel columns, and to indicate in the column devoted to
   the Septuagint the relation in which the old Alexandrian version stood
   to the current Hebrew text.


   3. The following specimen, taken from a fragment lately discovered at
   Milan, will assist the reader to understand the arrangement of the
   columns, and to realise the general appearance of the Hexapla.

   The process as a whole is minutely described by Eusebius and Jerome,
   who had seen the work, and by Epiphanius, whose account is still more
   explicit but less trustworthy.

     Eus. H. E. vi. 16: tautas de hapasa [sc. tas ekdoseis] epi tauton

     digesserat de Caesariensi bibliotheca descriptos ex ipsis

     characteribus verba descripta et Graecis literis tramite expressa
     vicino; Aquila etiam et Symmachus, LXX. quoque et Theodotio suum
     ordinem tenent; nonnulli vero libri et maxime hi qui apud Hebraeos
     versu compositi sunt tres alias editiones additas habuit." Cf. his
     letter to Sunnias and Fretela (ep. 106) and to Augustine (ep. 112)
     and the preface to the Book of Chronicles. Epiph. de mens. et pond.
     7: tas gar hex hermeneias kai ten Ebraiken graphen Ebraikois

     meth' has he tou Theodotionos suntetaktai, kai hexes he pempte te
     kai hekte [178] .

   It will be seen that the specimen corroborates ancient testimony in
   reference to the relative order of the four Greek versions (Aq., Symm.,
   LXX., Theod.), and illustrates the method of division into
   corresponding kola [179] which made comparison easy. With regard to the
   order, it is clear that Origen did not mean it to be chronological.
   Epiphanius seeks to account for the position of the LXX. in the fifth
   column by the not less untenable hypothesis that Origen regarded the
   LXX. as the standard of accuracy (de mens. et pond. 19: Origenes
   puthomenos ten ton ob' ekdosin akribe einai mesen tauten sunetheken,
   hopos tas enteuthen kai enteuthen hermeneias dielenche). As we have
   learned from Origen himself, the fact was the reverse; the other Greek
   versions were intended to check and correct the LXX. But the remark,
   though futile in itself, suggests a probable explanation. Aquila is
   placed next to the Hebrew text because his translation is the most
   verbally exact, and Symmachus and Theodotion follow Aquila and the LXX.
   respectively, because Symmachus on the whole is a revision of Aquila,
   and Theodotion of the LXX. As to the kola, it was of course necessary
   that the lines should be as short as possible when six or more columns
   had to be presented on each opening; and it will be seen that in the
   Psalms at least not more than two Hebrew words were included in a line,
   the corresponding Greek words being at the most three or four [180] .
   But the claims of the sense are not neglected; indeed it will appear
   upon inspection that the method adopted serves in a remarkable degree
   to accentuate the successive steps in the movement of the thought.

   4. Besides the Hexapla, Origen compiled a Tetrapla, i.e. a minor
   edition from which he omitted the first two columns containing the
   Hebrew text in Hebrew and Greek characters; cf. Eus. l.c. idios ten
   Akulou kai Summachou kai Theodotionos ekdosin hama te ton o' en tois
   tetraplois epikataskeuasas [181] . Epiph. de mens. et pond. 19 tetrapla
   gar eisi ta Hellenika hotan hai tou Akolou kai Summachou kai ton ob'
   kai Theodotionos hermeneiai suntetagmenai osi. The Tetrapla is
   occasionally mentioned along with the Hexapla in scholia attached to
   MSS. of the LXX. Thus in the Syro-Hexaplaric version at the end of
   Joshua it is stated that the Greek codex on which the version was based
   had the note: egrale ek tou hexaplou, ex hou kai paretethe; anteble?the
   de kai pros ton tetraploun. Cod. Q still contains two similar
   references to the Tetrapla (O. T. in Greek, iii., p. viii., notes).
   Mention is also made in the MSS. of an Octapla (cf. the Syro-Hexaplar
   in Job v. 23, vi. 28, and the Hexaplaric MSS. of the Psalter in Ps.
   lxxv. 1, lxxxvi. 5, lxxxviii. 43, cxxxi. 4, cxxxvi. 1) [182] . The
   question arises whether the Octapla was a distinct work, or merely
   another name for the Hexapla in books where the columns were increased
   to eight by the addition of the Quinta and Sexta. Eusebius appears to
   support the latter view, for he speaks of the Hexapla of the Psalms as
   including the Quinta and Sexta (H. E. vi. 16 en ge men tois hexaplois
   ton Psalmon meta tas etisemous tessaras ekdoseis ou monon pempten alla
   kai hekten kai hebdomen paratheis hermeneian). Epiphanius, on the other
   hand, seems to limit the Hexapla to the six columns (l. c. ton tessaron
   de touton selidon tais dusi tais Ebraikais sunaphtheison hexapla
   kaleitai; ean de kai he pempte kai he hekte hermeneia sunaphthosin
   . . . oktapla kaleitai. But it has been observed that when the scholia
   in Hexaplaric MSS. mention the Octapla they are silent as to the
   Hexapla, although the Octapla and the Tetrapla are mentioned together;
   e.g. in Ps. lxxxvi. 5 we find the following note:   to  kata prostheken
   ekeito eis ten ton o' en to tetraselido (the Tetrapla), en de to
   oktaselido (the Octapla), , egoun dicha tou . The inference is that the
   name 'Octapla' sometimes superseded that of 'Hexapla' in the Psalms,
   because in the Psalter of the Hexapla there were two additional columns
   which received the Quinta and Sexta. Similarly the term 'Heptapla' was
   occasionally used in reference to portions of the Hexapla where a
   seventh column appeared, but not an eighth [183] . 'Pentapla' is cited
   by J. Curterius from cod. Q at Isa. iii. 24, and Field's suspicion that
   Curterius had read his MS. incorrectly is not confirmed by a reference
   to the photograph, which exhibits en to pentaselido. Origen's work,
   then, existed (as Eusebius implies) in two forms: (1) the Hexapla,
   which contained, as a rule, six columns, but sometimes five or seven or
   eight, when it was more accurately denominated the Pentapla, Heptapla,
   or Octapla; and (2) the Tetrapla, which contained only four columns
   answering to the four great Greek versions, excluding the Hebrew and
   Greek-Hebrew texts on the one hand, and the Quinta and Sexta on the
   other.


   5. The Hebrew text of the Hexapla was of course that which was current
   among Origen's Jewish teachers in the third century, and which he took
   to be truly representative of the original. Portions of the second
   column, which have been preserved, are of interest as shewing the
   pronunciation of the Hebrew consonants and the vocalisation which was
   then in use. &gt;From the specimen already given it will be seen that k
   = ch, q = k, and s ,ts ,s = s and that ' h ch are without equivalent
   [184] . The divergences of the vocalisation from that which is
   represented by the pointing of the M. T. are more important; see Dr
   Taylor's remarks in D. C. B. ii. p. 15 f.

   In regard to Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and the minor Greek
   versions, Origen's task was limited to transcription under the
   conditions imposed by the plan of his work. But the fifth column, which
   contained the Hexaplaric LXX., called for the full exercise of his
   critical powers. If his first idea had been, as his own words almost
   suggest, merely to transcribe the LXX. in its proper place, without
   making material alterations in the text, a closer comparison of the
   LXX. with the current Hebrew text and the versions based upon it must
   soon have convinced him that this was impracticable. Let us suppose
   that there lay before him an Alexandrian or Palestinian MS., containing
   the 'common' text of the LXX. e koine, or vulgata editio , as Jerome
   calls it [185] ), i. e. the text of the Greek Bible as it was read by
   the Church of the third century. As the transcription proceeded, it
   would be seen that every column of the Greek contained clauses which
   were not in the Hebrew, and omitted clauses which the Hebrew contained.
   Further, in many places the order of the Greek would be found to depart
   from that of the Hebrew, the divergence being sometimes limited to a
   clause or a verse or two, but occasionally extending to several
   chapters. Lastly, in innumerable places the LXX. would be seen to yield
   a sense more or less at variance with the current Hebrew, either
   through misapprehension on the part of the translators or through a
   difference in the underlying text. These causes combined to render the
   coordination of the Alexandrian Greek with the existing Hebrew text a
   task of no ordinary difficulty, and the solution to which Origen was
   led appeared to him to be little short of an inspiration theou didontos
   heuromen).

   Origen began by assuming (1) the purity of the Hebrew text, and (2) the
   corruption of the koine where it departed from the Hebrew [186] . The
   problem before him was to restore the LXX. to its original purity, i.e.
   to the Hebraica veritas as he understood it, and thus to put the Church
   in possession of an adequate Greek version of the Old Testament without
   disturbing its general allegiance to the time-honoured work of the
   Alexandrian translators. Some of the elements in this complex process
   were comparatively simple. (1) Differences of order were met by
   transposition, the Greek order making way for the Hebrew. In this
   manner whole sections changed places in the LXX. text of Exodus, 1
   Kings, and Jeremiah; in Proverbs only, for some reason not easy to
   determine, the two texts were allowed to follow their respective
   courses, and the divergence of the Greek order from the Hebrew was
   indicated by certain marks [187] prefixed to the stichi of the LXX.
   column. (2) Corruptions in the koine, real or supposed, were tacitly
   corrected in the Hexapla, whether from better MSS. of the LXX., or from
   the renderings of other translators, or, in the case of proper names,
   by a simple adaptation of the Alexandrian Greek form to that which was
   found in the current Hebrew [188] . (3) The additions and omissions in
   the LXX. presented greater difficulty. Origen was unwilling to remove
   the former, for they belonged to the version which the Church had
   sanctioned, and which many Christians regarded as inspired Scripture;
   but he was equally unwilling to leave them without some mark of
   editorial disapprobation. Omissions were readily supplied from one of
   the other versions, namely Aquila or Theodotion; but the new matter
   interpolated into the LXX. needed to be carefully distinguished from
   the genuine work of the Alexandrian translators [189] . See Add. Notes.


   6. Here the genius of Origen found an ally in the system of critical
   signs which had its origin among the older scholars of Alexandria,
   dating almost from the century which produced the earlier books of the
   LXX. The Aristarcheia semata took their name from the prince of
   Alexandrian grammarians, Aristarchus, who flourished in the reign of
   Philopator (A.D. 222--205, and they appear to have been first employed
   in connexion with his great edition of Homer [190] . Origen selected
   two of these signs known as the obelus and the asterisk, and adapted
   them to the use of his edition of the Septuagint. In the Homeric poems,
   as edited by Aristarchus, the obelus marked passages which the critic
   wished to censure, while the asterisk was affixed to those which seemed
   to him to be worthy of special attention; cf. the anecdoton printed by
   Gardthausen: ho de obelos pros ta athetoumena epi tou poietou egoun
   nenotheumena e hupobeblemena; ho de asteriskos . . . hos kalon
   eiremenon ton epon. Similarly, in connexion with Platonic dicta ,
   Diogenes Laertius (platon. iii. 657) used the obelus pros ten athetesin
   and the asterisk pros ten sumphonian ton dogmaton. As employed by
   Origen in the fifth column of the Hexapla, the obelus was prefixed to
   words or lines which were wanting in the Hebrew, and therefore, from
   Origen's point of view, of doubtful authority [191] , whilst the
   asterisk called attention to words or lines wanting in the LXX., but
   present in the Hebrew. The close of the context to which the obelus or
   asterisk was intended to apply was marked by another sign known as the
   metobelus. When the passage exceeded the length of a single line, the
   asterisk or obelus was repeated at the beginning of each subsequent
   line until the metobelus was reached.

     Epiph. de mens. et pond. 2, 3 ho asteriskos . . . semainei to
     empheromenon rhema en to Ebraiko keisthai . . . hoi de ob'
     hermeneutai parekan kai ouch hermeneukan . . . obelos de . . .
     paretithe . . . tais tes theias graphes lexesin tais para tois ob'
     hermeneutais keimenais, para de tois peri Akulan kai Summachon me
     empheromenais. Schol. ap. Tisch. not. ed cod. Sin. p. 76 hosois oi
     obeloi proskeintai rhetois, houtoi ouk ekeinto oute para tois
     loipois hermeneutais oute en to Ebraiko, alla para monois tois o';
     kai hosois hoi asteriskoi proskeintai rhetois, outoi en men to
     Ebraiko kai tois loipois hermeneutais epheronto, en de tois o'
     ouketi.

   Occasionally Origen used asterisk and obelus together, as Aristarchus
   had done, to denote that the order of the Greek was at fault (anecd.
   ap. Gardthausen: ho de asteriskos meta obelou, hos onta men ta epe tou
   poietou, me kalos de keimena: schol. ap. Tisch. not. ed. Sin. l. c.
   pherontai men para tois o', pherontai de en to Ebraiko kai para tois
   loipois hermeneutais, ten thesin de monen parallassousin hoi loipoi kai
   to Ebraikon para tous o'; hothen obelistai en tauto kai esteristai, hos
   para pasi men pheromena, ouk en tois autois de topois: also ap. mon.
   sacr. ined. iii. p. xvii. ta de esterismena en tauto kai obelismena
   rheta . . . hos para pasi men pheromena, ouk en tois autois de topois).
   The Aristarchian (or as they are usually called by students of the Old
   Testament, the Hexaplaric) signs are also used by Origen when he
   attempts to place before the reader of his LXX. column an exact version
   of the Hebrew without displacing the LXX. rendering. Where the LXX. and
   the current Hebrew are hopelessly at issue, he occasionally gives two
   versions, that of one of the later translators distinguished by an
   asterisk, and that of the LXX. under an obelus [192] .

   The form of the asterisk, obelus, and metobelus varies slightly. The
   first consists of the letter x, usually surrounded by four dots ( , the
   chi teriestigmenon); the form occurs but seldom, and only, as it seems,
   in the Syro-Hexaplar. The orelos, 'spit' or 'spear,' is represented in
   Epiphanius by , but in the MSS. of the LXX. a horizontal straight line
   (--) [193] has taken the place of the original form, with or without
   occupying dot or dots ( ); the form was known as a lemniscus, and the
   form as a hypolemniscus. Epiphanius indeed (op. cit., c. 8) fancies
   that each dot represents a pair of translators, so that the lemniscus
   means that the word or clause which the LXX. adds to the Hebrew had the
   support of two out of the thirty-six pairs which composed the whole
   body, whilst the hypolemniscus claims for it the support of only one
   pair. This explanation, it is scarcely necessary to say, is as baseless
   as the fiction of the cells on which, in the later Epiphanian form, it
   rests. Other attempts to assign distinct values to the various forms of
   the obelus have been shewn by Field to be untenable [194] . The
   metobelus is usually represented by two dots arranged perpendicularly
   (:), like a colon; other forms are a sloping line with a dot before it
   or on either side (/., ·/.), and in the Syro-Hexaplar and other Syriac
   versions a mallet . The latter form, as the least ambiguous, is used in
   Field's great edition of the Hexapla, and in the apparatus which is
   printed under the text of the LXX. version of Daniel in the Cambridge
   manual Septuagint.

     Certain other signs found in Hexaplaric MSS. are mentioned in the
     following scholion Euagriou sch., one of the scholia eis tas
     paroimias printed in the Notitia ed. cod. Sin., p. 76, from a Patmos
     MS.; see Robinson, Philocalia, pp. xiii., xvii. ff.): eisin [195]
     hosa protetagmenon echousi ton arithmon hode; hosa Origenen
     epigegrammenon echei touto to monosullabo, . . . hosa de peri

   The following extract from the great Hexaplaric MS. known as G will
   enable the student, to whom the subject may be new, to practise himself
   in the interpretation of the signs. He will find it instructive to
   compare the extract with his Hebrew Bible on the one hand and the text
   of Cod. B (printed in the Cambridge LXX.) on the other [196] .


   Joshua xi. 10--14 (Cod. Sarravianus).

   7. The Hexapla was completed, as we have seen, by A.D. 240 or 245; the
   Tetrapla, which was a copy of four columns of the Hexapla, followed,
   perhaps during Origen's last years at Tyre. [197] A large part of the
   labour of transcription may have been borne by the copyists who were in
   constant attendance on the great scholar, but he was doubtless his own
   diorthotes, and the two Hebrew columns and the LXX. column of the
   Hexapla were probably written by his own hand.

   Eusebius in a well-known passage describes the costly and laborious
   process by which Origen's commentaries on Scripture were given to the
   world: H. E. vi. 23 tachugraphoi gar auto pleious e hepta ton arithmon
   paresan hupagoreuonti, chronois tetagmenois allelous ameibontes,
   bibliographoi te ouch hettous hama kai korais epi to kalligraphein
   eskemenais; hon hapanton ten deousan ton epitedeion aphthonon
   periousian ho Ambrosios parestesato. Two of these classes of workers,
   the bibliographoi and kalligraphoi (cf. Gardthausen, Gr. Palaeographie,
   p. 297), must have found ample employment in the preparation of the
   Hexapla. The material used was possibly papyrus. Although there are
   extant fragments of writing on vellum which may be attributed to the
   second century, "there is every reason to suppose that to the end of
   the third century papyrus held its own, at any rate in Egypt, as the
   material on which literary works were written" (Kenyon, Palaeography of
   Gk papyri, p. 113 f.; on the size of existing papyrus rolls, see p. 16
   ff.). This view receives some confirmation from Jerome's statement (ep.
   141) that Acacius and Evagrius endeavoured to replace with copies on
   parchment some of the books in the library at Caesarea which were in a
   damaged condition ("bibliothecam . . . ex parte corruptam . . . in
   membranis instaurare conati sunt") [198] . According to Tischendorf
   (prolegg. in cod. Frid. Aug. § 1) cod. ' was written on skins of
   antelopes, each of which supplied only two leaves of the MS. The
   Hexapla, if copied in so costly a way, would have taxed the resources
   even of Origen's generous ergodioktes.

   It is difficult to conceive of a codex or series of codices so gigantic
   as the Hexapla. Like the great Vatican MS., it would have exhibited at
   each opening at least six columns, and in certain books; like the
   Sinaitic MS., eight. Its bulk, even when allowance has been made for
   the absence in it of the uncanonical books, would have been nearly five
   times as great as that of the Vatican or the Sinaitic Old Testament.
   The Vatican MS. contains 759 leaves, of which 617 belong to the Old
   Testament; when complete, the O. T. must have occupied 650 leaves, more
   or less. From these data it may be roughly calculated that the Hexapla,
   if written in the form of a codex, would have filled 3250 leaves or
   6500 pages [199] ; and these figures are exclusive of the Quinta and
   Sexta, which may have swelled the total considerably. Even the Tetrapla
   would have exceeded 2000 leaves. So immense a work must have been the
   despair of copyists, and it is improbable that any attempt was made to
   reproduce either of the editions as a whole. The originals, however,
   were long preserved at Caesarea in Palestine, where they were
   deposited, perhaps by Origen himself, in the library of Pamphilus.
   There they were studied by Jerome in the fourth century (in Psalmos
   comm. ed. Morin., p. 5: "hexaplous Origenis in Caesariensi bibliotheca
   relegens"; ib. p. 12: "cum vetustum Origenis hexaplum psalterium
   revolverem, quod ipsius manu fuerat emendatum"; in ep. ad Tit.: "nobis
   curae fuit omnes veteris legis libros quos v. d. Adamantius in Hexapla
   digesserat de Caesariensi bibliotheca descriptos ex ipsis authenticis
   emendare." There also they were consulted by the writers and owners of
   Biblical MSS.; compare the interesting note attached by a hand of the
   seventh century to the book of Esther in cod. ' : anteblethe pros
   palaiotaton lian antigraphon dediorthomenon cheiri tou hagiou `arturos
   Pamphilou; pros de to telei tou autou palaiotatou bibliou . . .
   huposemeiosis tou autou marturos hupekeito echousa houtos;       (O. T.
   in Greek, ii. p. 780); and the notes prefixed to Isaiah and Ezekiel in
   Cod. Marchalianus (Q); the second of these notes claims that the copy
   from which Ezekiel was transcribed bore the subscription   ,
   (ib. iii. p. viii.) [200] . The library of Pamphilus was in existence
   in the 6th century, for Montfaucon (biblioth. Coisl. p. 262) quotes
   from Coisl. 202 [201] , a MS. of that century, a colophon which runs:
   anteblethe de he biblos pros to en Kaisaria antigraphon tes
   bibliothekes tou hagiou Pamphilou cheiri gegrammenon autou. But in 638
   Caesarea fell into the hands of the Saracens, and from that time the
   Library was heard of no more. Even if not destroyed at the moment, it
   is probable that every vestige of the collection perished during the
   vicissitudes through which the town passed between the 7th century and
   the 12th [202] . Had the Hexapla been buried in Egypt, she might have
   preserved it in her sands; it can scarcely be hoped that the sea-washed
   and storm-beaten ruins of Kaisariyeh cover a single leaf.

     LITERATURE. Fragments of the Hexapla were printed by Peter Morinus
     in his notes to the Roman edition of the Septuagint (1587). Separate
     collections have since been published by J. Drusius (Vet.
     interpretum Graecorum . . . fragmenta collecta . . . a Jo. Drusio,
     Arnheim, 1622), Bernard Montfaucon (Origenis Hexaplorum quae
     supersunt, Paris, 1713), and F. Field (Oxford, 1875), whose work has
     superseded all earlier attempts to recover the Hexapla. A fuller
     list may be seen in Fabricius-Harles, iii. 701 ff. Materials for an
     enlarged edition of Field are already beginning to accumulate; such
     may be found in Pitra, Analecta sacra, iii. (Venice, 1883), p 551
     ff.; E. Klostermann, Analecta zur . . . Hexapla (Leipzig, 1895), G.
     Morin, Anecdota Maredsolana iii. 1 (Mareds., 1895; cf. Expositor,
     June 1895, p. 424 ff.), and the Oxford Concordance. Among helps to
     the study of the Hexapla, besides the introductions already
     specified, the following may be mentioned: the Prolegomena in
     Field's Hexapla, the art. Hexapla in D. C. B. by Dr C. Taylor; the
     introduction to Dr Driver's Notes on Samuel (p. xliii. ff.), and
     Harnack-Preuschen, Gesch. altchristt. Litt. i. p. 339 ff. For the
     literature of the Syro-Hexaplaric version see c. iv.

   8. The Hexapla as a whole was perhaps too vast to be copied [203] , and
   copies even of particular books were rarely attempted; yet there was
   nothing to forbid the separate publication of the fifth column, which
   contained the revised Septuagint. This idea presented itself to
   Pamphilus and his friend Eusebius, and the result was the wide
   circulation in Palestine during the fourth century of the Hexaplaric
   LXX., detached from the Hebrew text and the other Greek versions, but
   retaining, more or less exactly, the corrections and additions adopted
   by Origen with the accompanying Hexaplaric signs. "Provinciae
   Palestinae," writes Jerome in his preface to Chronicles, "codices
   legunt quos ab Origene elaboratos Eusebius et Pamphilus vulgaverunt."
   Elsewhere [204] he warns his correspondents "aliam esse editionem quam
   Origenes et Caesariensis Eusebius omnesque Graeciae tractatores koinen
   (id est communem) appellant atque vulgatam . . ., aliam LXX.
   interpretum quae in exaplois codicibus reperitur . . et Ierosolymae
   atque in orientis ecclesia decantatur." The Hexaplaric text receives
   his unhesitating support: "ea autem quae habetur in hexaplois . . .
   ipsa est quae in eruditorum libris incorrupta et immaculata LXX.
   interpretum translatio reservatur [205] ." This edition, sometimes
   described as to Eusebiou or to Palaistinaion, or simply Or[igenes], is
   mentioned with great respect in the scholia of MSS. which do not on the
   whole follow its text. Specimens of such notes have already been given;
   they usually quote the words in which Pamphilus describes the part
   borne by himself and his friends respectively in the production of the
   book. Thus a note quoted by an early hand in cod. ' at the end of 2
   Esdras says, Antoninos antebalen, Pamphilos diorthosa. The subscription
   to Esther ends Antoninos homologetes antebalen, Pamphilos diorthosato
   [to] teuchos en te phulake. The scholion prefixed to Ezekiel in Q
   introduces the name of Eusebius, assigning him another function:
   Eusebios ego ta scholia paretheka; Pamphilos kai Eusebios diorthosanto.
   In its subscription to 1 Kings the Syro-Hexaplar quotes a note which
   runs: Eusebios diorthosamen hos akribos edunamen. It would seem as
   though the work of comparing the copy with the original was committed
   to the otherwise unknown [206] Antoninus, whilst the more responsible
   task of making corrections was reserved for Pamphilus and Eusebius
   [207] . Part of the work at least was done while Pamphilus lay in
   prison, i.e. between A.D. 307 and 309, but it was probably continued
   and completed by Eusebius after the martyr's death.

   The separate publication of the Hexaplaric LXX. was undertaken in
   absolute good faith; Pamphilus and Eusebius believed (as did even
   Jerome nearly a century afterwards) that Origen had succeeded in
   restoring the old Greek version to its primitive purity, and they were
   moved by the desire to communicate this treasure to the whole Church.
   It was impossible for them to foresee that the actual result of their
   labours would be to create a recension of the LXX. which was a
   mischievous mixture of the Alexandrian version with the versions of
   Aquila and Theodotion. The Hexaplaric signs, intended for the use of
   scholars, lost their meaning when copied into a text which was no
   longer confronted with the Hebrew or the later versions based upon it;
   and there was a natural tendency on the part of scribes to omit them,
   when their purpose was no longer manifest.

   When we consider that the Hexaplaric Septuagint claimed to be the work
   of Origen, and was issued under the authority of the martyr Pamphilus
   and the yet greater Bishop of Caesarea, we can but wonder that its
   circulation was generally limited to Palestine [208] . Not one of our
   uncial Bibles gives the Hexaplaric text as a whole, and it is presented
   in a relatively pure form by very few MSS., the uncials G and M, which
   contain only the Pentateuch and some of the historical books, and the
   cursives 86 and 88 (Holmes and Parsons), which contain the Prophets.
   But a considerable number of so-called Hexaplaric codices exist, from
   which it is possible to collect fragments not only of the fifth column,
   but of all the Greek columns of the Hexapla; and a still larger number
   of our MSS. offer a mixed text in which the influence of the Hexaplaric
   LXX., or of the edition published by Pamphilus and Eusebius, has been
   more or less extensively at work [209] . The problems presented by this
   and other causes of mixture will come under consideration in the later
   chapters of this book.


   9. While the Hexaplaric Septuagint was being copied at Caesarea for the
   use of Palestine, Hesychius was engaged in correcting the common
   Egyptian text.

     Hieron. in praef. ad Paralipp.: "Alexandria et Aegyptus in
     Septuaginta suis Hesychium laudat auctorem"; cf. adv. Rufin. ii.
     where the statement is repeated [210] , and praef. in Evangelia,
     where the revision of Hesychius is represented as having included
     both Testaments, and his O. T. work is condemned as infelicitous
     ("nec in V.T. post LXX. interpretes emendare quod licuit"); the
     Hesychian revision of the Gospels is censured by the Decretum
     Gelasii, which even denounces them as apocryphal ("evangelia quae
     falsavit Hesychius, apocrypha").

   It is not easy to ascertain who this Hesychius was. The most
   conspicuous person of that name is the lexicographer, and he has been
   identified with the reviser of the Greek Bible [211] . But later
   researches shew that Hesychius the lexicographer was a pagan who lived
   in the second half of the fourth century. The author of the Egyptian
   revision was more probably [212] the martyr Bishop who is mentioned by
   Eusebius in connexion with Phileas Bishop of Thmuis, Pachymius, and
   Theodorus (H. E. viii. 13 Phileas te kai Hesuchios kai Pachumios kai
   Theodoros ton amphi ten Aigupton ekklesion episkopoi). The four names
   appear together again in a letter addressed to Meletius (Routh, rell.
   sacr. iv. p. 91 ff.); and Eusebius has preserved a pastoral written by
   Phileas in prison in view of his approaching martyrdom (H. E. viii.
   10). Phileas was a distinguished scholar (H. E. viii. 9 diaprepsas . .
   en . . tois kata philosophian logois, ib. 10 ton exothen mathematon
   heneka pollou logou axion . . . tou hos alethos philosophou . .
   marturos), and the association of his name with that of Hesychius
   suggests that he may have shared in the work of Biblical revision. It
   is pleasant to think of the two episcopal confessors employing their
   enforced leisure in their Egyptian prison by revising the Scriptures
   for the use of their flocks, nearly at the same time that Pamphilus and
   Eusebius and Antoninus were working under similar conditions at
   Caesarea. It is easy to account for the acceptance of the Hesychian
   revision at Alexandria and in Egypt generally, if it was produced under
   such circumstances.

   To what extent the Hesychian recession of the Old Testament is still
   accessible in MSS. and versions of the LXX. is uncertain. As far back
   as 1786 Münter threw out the very natural suggestion that the Egyptian
   recession might be found in the Egyptian versions. In his great
   monograph on the Codex Marchalianus Ceriani takes note that in the
   Prophets, with the exception perhaps of Ezekiel, the original text of
   that great Egyptian MS. agrees closely with the text presupposed by the
   Egyptian versions and in the works of Cyril of Alexandria, and that it
   is supported by the cursive MSS. 26, 106, 198, 306; other cursives of
   the same type are mentioned by Cornill [213] as yielding an Hesychian
   text in Ezekiel. For the remaining books of the LXX. we have as yet no
   published list of MSS. containing a probably Hesychian text, but the
   investigations now being pursued by the editors of the larger Cambridge
   LXX. may be expected to yield important help in this direction [214] .


   10. Meanwhile the rising school of Antioch was not inactive in the
   field of Biblical revision. An Antiochian recession of the koine had in
   Jerome's time come to be known by the name of its supposed author, the
   martyr Lucian [215] .

     Hieron. praef. in Paralipp.: "Constantinopolis usque Antiochiam
     Luciani martyris exemplaria probat." Cf. (Ep. cvi.) ad Sunn. et
     Fret. 2 "[he koine] . . . a plerisque nunc Loukianos dicitur."
     Ps.-Athan. syn. sacr. script. hebdome palin kai teleueaia hermeneia

     metatheseos . . . autos hapasas analabon ek tes Ebraidos
     epaneneosato glosses. Cf. also Cyr. Alex. in Psalmos praef.

   Lucian, who was born at Samosata, began his studies at Edessa, whence
   he passed to Antioch at a time when Malchion was master of the Greek
   School (Eus. H. E. vii. 29, Hieron. de virr. ill. 71). At Antioch
   Lucian acquired a great reputation for Biblical learning (Eus. H. E.
   ix. 6 tois hierois mathhumasi sunkekrotemenos, Suid. s.v. auten [sc.
   ten Ebraida glossan] hos ta malista en ekribokos). From some cause not
   clearly explained Lucian was under a cloud for several years between
   A.D. 270 and 299 (Theodoret [216] , H. E. i. 3 aposunagogos emeine
   trion episkopon poluetous chronou). On his restoration to communion he
   was associated with Dorotheus, who was a Hebrew scholar, as well as a
   student of Greek literature (Eus. H. E. vii. 32 philokalos d' houtos
   peri ta theia grammata kai tes Ebraion epemelethe glottes, hos kai
   autais tais Ebraikais graphais epistemonos entunchanein; en de houtos
   ton malista eleutherion, propaideias te tes kath' Hellenas ouk
   amoiros). As Pamphilus was assisted by Eusebius, as Phileas and others
   were probably associated with Hesychius, so (the conjecture may be
   hazarded) Dorotheus and Lucian worked together at the Antiochian
   revision of the Greek Bible. If, as Dr Hort thought, "of known names
   Lucian's has a better claim than any other to be associated with the
   early Syrian revision of the New Testament [217] ," the Syrian revision
   of the Old Testament, which called for a knowledge of Hebrew, may have
   been due more especially to the Hebraist Dorotheus. Lucian, however,
   has the exclusive credit of the latter, and possibly was the originator
   of the entire work. If we may believe certain later writers, his
   revision of the LXX. was on a great scale, and equivalent to a new
   version of the Hebrew Bible; Pseudo-Athanasius goes so far as to call
   it the hebdome hermeneia, placing it on a level with the Greek versions
   of the Hexapla. But Jerome's identification of 'Lucian' with the koine
   presents quite another view of its character and one which is probably
   nearer to the truth. It was doubtless an attempt to revise the koine in
   accordance with the principles of criticism which were accepted at
   Antioch. In the New Testament (to use the words of Dr Hort [218] ) "the
   qualities which the authors of the Syrian text seem to have most
   desired to impress on it are lucidity and completeness . . . both in
   matter and in diction the Syrian text is conspicuously a full text." If
   the Lucianic revision of the LXX. was made under the influences which
   guided the Antiochian revision of the New Testament, we may expect to
   find the same general principles at work [219] , modified to some
   extent by the relation of the LXX., to a Hebrew original, and by the
   circumstance that the Hebrew text current in Syria in the third century
   A.D. differed considerably from the text which lay before the
   Alexandrian translators.

   We are not left entirely to conjectures. During his work upon the
   Hexapla [220] Field noticed that in an epistle prefixed to the Arabic
   Syro-Hexaplar [221] , the marginal letter (L) was said to indicate
   Lucianic readings. Turning to the Syro-Hexaplar itself, he found this
   letter in the margin of 2 Kings (= 4 Regn.) at cc. ix. 9, 28, x. 24,
   25, xi. 1, xxiii. 33, 35, But the readings thus marked as Lucianic
   occur also in the cursive Greek MSS. 19, 82, 93, 108; and further
   examination shewed that these four MSS. in the Books of Kings,
   Chronicles, and Ezra-Nehemiah agree with the text of the LXX. offered
   by the Antiochian fathers Chrysostom and Theodoret, who might have been
   expected to cite from 'Lucian.' Similar reasoning led Field to regard
   codd. 22, 36, 48, 51, 62, 90, 93, 144, 147, 233, 308 as presenting a
   more or less Lucianic text in the Prophets. Meanwhile, Lagarde had
   independently [222] reached nearly the same result, so far as regards
   the historical books. He satisfied himself that codd. 19, 82, 93, 108,
   118 [223] , had sprung from a common archetype, the text of which was
   practically identical with that of the LXX. as quoted by Chrysostom,
   i.e., with the Antiochian text of the fourth century, which presumably
   was Lucianic. Lagarde proceeded to construct from these and other
   sources a provisional text of Lucian, but his lamented death
   intercepted the work, and only the first volume of his Lucianic LXX.
   has appeared (Genesis--2 Esdr., Esther).

     The following specimen will serve to shew the character of Lucian's
     revision, as edited by Lagarde; an apparatus is added which exhibits
     the readings of codd. B and A.


     3 Regn. xviii. 22-28.

     A comparison of 'Lucian' in this passage with the two great uncials
     of the LXX. reveals two classes of variants in the former. (1) Some
     of the changes appear to be due to a desire to render the version
     smoother or fuller, e.g. Helias for Heleiou, the repetition of
     prophetes before monotatos, the substitution of ton alson for tou
     alsous, of apekrithe for apekrithesan, and of agathos ho logos for
     kalon to rhema, and the addition of semeron. (2) Others seem to
     indicate an attempt to get nearer to the Hebrew, e.g. dotosan oun
     (vytgv), boun (pr); or an adherence to an older reading which the
     Hexaplaric LXX. had set aside, e.g. the omission of hon edoken
     autois [224] and ek proithen heos mesembrias. On the other hand
     Lucian follows the current Hebrew in kata ton ethismon auton, though
     he substitutes the easier ethismos for Aquila's krima, which cod. A
     has taken over from the Hexapla.

     Professor Driver, as the result of a wider examination, points out
     [225] that the Lucianic recession is distinguished by (1) the
     substitution of synonyms for the words employed by the LXX.; (2) the
     occurrence of double renderings; (3) the occurrence of renderings
     "which presuppose a Hebrew original self-evidently superior in the
     passages concerned to the existing Massoretic text." The last of
     these peculiarities renders it of great importance for the criticism
     of the Hebrew Bible.

   Lucian suffered martyrdom at Nicomedia under Maximin in the year 311 or
   312 [226] . According to the Pseudo-Athanasian Synopsis, his recension
   of the LXX. was subsequently discovered at Nicomedia, bricked up in a
   wall. The story may have arisen from a desire to invest the hebdome (as
   'Lucian' is called by the author of the Synopsis) with the same air of
   romance that belonged to the Quinta and Sexta, both of which were
   found, as he asserts, en pithois. It is more probable that copies were
   circulated from Antioch in the ordinary way, and that some of these
   after the persecution reached Nicomedia and Constantinople. The name of
   Lucian would be enough to guarantee the general acceptance of the work.
   He died in the peace of the Church, and a martyr; on the other hand his
   name was in high repute with the Arian leaders, who boasted of being
   sulloukianistai [227] . Moreover, a revision which emanated from
   Antioch, the "ecclesiastical parent of Constantinople [228] ," would
   naturally take root in the soil of the Greek East. In all dioceses
   which felt the influences of those two great sees, the Lucianic LXX.
   doubtless furnished during the fourth and fifth centuries the prevalent
   text of the Greek Old Testament [229] .


   11. The result of these multiplied labours of Christian scholars upon
   the text of the LXX. was not altogether satisfactory. Before the time
   of Jerome much of the original text of the Alexandrian Bible had
   disappeared. Men read their Old Testament in the recension of Lucian,
   if they lived in North Syria, Asia Minor, or Greece; in that of
   Hesychius, if they belonged to the Delta or the valley of the Nile; in
   Origen's Hexaplaric edition, if they were residents at Jerusalem or
   Caesarea. Thus, as the scholar of Bethlehem complains, the Christian
   world was divided between three opposing texts ("totus . . . orbis hac
   inter se trifaria varietate compugnat [230] "). To Jerome, as a
   Palestinian and an admirer of Origen's critical principles, the remedy
   was simple; the Hexaplaric text, which had been assimilated to the
   Hebraica veritas, ought everywhere to take the place of the koine
   represented by Hesychius or Lucian. Fortunately the task was beyond his
   strength, and MSS. and versions still survive which represent more or
   less fully the three recessions of the fourth century. But the trifaria
   varietas did not continue to perplex the Church; a fusion of texts
   arose which affected the greater part of the copies in varying
   proportions. No one of the rival recessions became dominant and
   traditional, as in the case of the New Testament [231] ; among the
   later MSS, groups may be discerned which answer more or less certainly
   to this recession or to that, but the greater number of the cursives
   present a text which appears to be the result of mixture rather than of
   any conscious attempt to decide between the contending types.

   Book of Job offered the largest field for interpolation: a scholion in

   Lietzmann (Gött. gel. Anz. 1902, 5) and G. Mercati (Atti d. R. Acc. d.

  CHAPTER IV.

    ANCIENT VERSIONS BASED UPON THE SEPTUAGINT.

   THE Christian Churches of Greek-speaking countries throughout the
   Empire read the Old Testament in the Alexandrian Version. Few of the
   provinces were wholly non-Hellenic; Greek was spoken not only in Egypt
   and Cyrenaica, in Western Syria, Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Achaia, but
   to a great extent in the West, in Italy and at Rome. Roman satirists of
   the first century complained that the capital had become a Greek city;
   the upper classes acquired Greek; the freedmen and slaves in many cases
   spoke it as their mother tongue [232] . Official letters addressed to
   the Roman Church or proceeding from her during the first two centuries
   were written in Greek; only three or at the most four of the Bishops of
   Rome during the same period bear Latin names [233] . In Gaul the Greek
   tongue had spread up the valley of the Rhone from Marseilles to Vienne
   and Lyons; the Viennese confessors of A.D. 177 used it in their
   correspondence both with the Roman Bishops and with their brethren in
   Asia Minor; the Bishop of Lyons wrote in the same language his great
   work against the false gnosis of the age. The Old Testament as known to
   Clement of Rome and Irenaeus of Lyons is substantially the Greek
   version of the Seventy. To the Church of North Africa, on the other
   hand, the Greek Bible was a sealed book; for Carthage, colonised from
   Rome before the capital had been flooded by Greek residents, retained
   the Latin tongue as the language of common life. It was at Carthage,
   probably, that the earliest daughter-version of the Septuagint, the Old
   Latin Bible, first saw the light [234] ; certainly it is there that the
   oldest form of the Old Latin Bible first meets us in the writings of
   Cyprian. Other versions followed as the result of missionary
   enterprise; and to this latter source we owe the translations of the
   Old Testament which were made between the second century and the ninth
   into Egyptian, Ethiopic, Arabic, Gothic, Armenian, Georgian, and
   Slavonic. All these versions rest either wholly or in part upon the
   Septuagint, and therefore possess a special interest for the student of
   the Greek Bible. One other group has a claim upon his consideration.
   The earliest of the Syriac versions of the Old Testament is on the
   whole a translation from the Hebrew, but it shews the influence of the
   Septuagint in certain books. The rest, which belong to post-Nicene
   times, are based directly upon the Alexandrian Greek, and one of them
   forms the most important of extant witnesses to the text of the
   Hexaplaric recension.

    1. LATIN VERSIONS FROM THE SEPTUAGINT.

   (1) The Latin Bible before Jerome.

   With the exception of Jerome himself, our earliest authority upon the
   origin of the Old Latin Bible is Augustine of Hippo, and it may be well
   to begin by collecting his statements upon the subject.

     Aug. de civ. Dei xviii. 43 ex hac LXX. interpretatione etiam in
     Latinam linguam interpretatum est quod ecclesiae Latinae tenent. De
     doctr. Christ. ii. 16 [after a reference to the "Latinorum
     interpretum infinita varietas"] "qui enim scripturas ex Hebraea
     lingua in Graecam verterunt, numerari possunt, Latini interpretes
     nullo modo; ut enim cuique primis fidei temporibus in manus venit
     codex Graecus et aliquantulum facultatis sibi utriusque linguae
     habere videbatur ausus est interpretari." Ib. 22: "in ipsis autem
     interpretationibus Itala ceteris praeferatur." Ep. ii. 82 (ad
     Hieronymum): "ideo autem desidero interpretationem tuam de LXX. ut
     . . . tanta Latinorum interpretum qui qualescunque hoc ausi sunt
     quantum possumus imperitia careamus."

   This is African testimony, but it belongs to the end of the fourth
   century, and needs to be verified before it can be unhesitatingly
   received. Many of the discrepancies to which Augustine refers may be
   due to the carelessness or officiousness of correctors or transcribers;
   if, as Jerome tells us, there were towards the end of the fourth
   century as many types of text as there were MSS. of the Latin Bible
   ("tot exemplaria quot codices"), it is clearly out of the question to
   ascribe each of these to a separate translator. A few specimens, taken
   from Cyprian and extant MSS. of the O. L., will enable the student to
   form some idea of the extent to which these differences are found in
   extant texts [235] .

   It is clearly unsafe to generalise from a few specimens, but the
   student will not fail to observe that the variations in these extracts
   may, perhaps without exception, be attributed either to the ordinary
   accidents of transcription or to the recensions of the original text.
   In the case of the New Testament Dr Hort [242] held that there was
   "some justification for the alternative view that Italy had an
   indigenous version of her own, not less original than the African," and
   where both types of text existed, he distinguished them by the
   designations 'African Latin' and 'European Latin,' applying the term
   'Italian' [243] to later revisions of the European text. The
   classification of the Old Latin authorities for the O. T. is less
   advanced, and owing to the fragmentary character of most of the MSS. it
   is more difficult; but we may assume that it will proceed on the same
   general lines, and that the pre-Hieronymian types of text in the Old
   Testament as in the New will be found to be mainly two, i.e. the
   African, and the European, with a possible sub-division of the latter
   class [244] . In pursuing this enquiry use must be made not only of the
   surviving fragments of O. L. MSS., but of the numerous quotations of
   the Latin versions which occur in writings anterior to the final
   triumph of the Vulgate. As Dr Hort has pointed out [245] , certain of
   the Latin fathers "constitute a not less important province of Old
   Latin evidence than the extant MSS., not only furnishing landmarks for
   the investigation of the history of the version, but preserving
   numerous verses and passages in texts belonging to various ages and in
   various stages of modification." These patristic materials were
   collected with great care and fulness by Sabatier (Bibliorum sacrorum
   Latinae versiones antiquae . . . opera et studio D. Petri Sabatier O.
   S. B., Reims, 1743, '49, Paris, 1751; vols. i. ii. contain the O. T.) ;
   but after the lapse of a century and a half his quotations can no
   longer be accepted without being compared with more recent editions of
   the Latin fathers [246] , and they often need to be supplemented from
   sources which were not at his command [247] .

   These researches are important to the student of the Septuagint in so
   far as they throw light on the condition of the Greek text in the
   second and third centuries after Christ. The Latin translation of the
   Old Testament which is largely quoted by Cyprian was probably made in
   the second century, and certainly represents the text of MSS. earlier
   than the time of Origen. What Mr Burkitt has pointed out [248] in
   reference to the prophetic books is doubtless true in general; "no
   . . . passage [to which the asterisk is prefixed in Hexaplaric MSS. is
   found in any form of the African Latin." Thus, as he remarks, "the Old
   Latin brings us the best independent proof we have that the Hexaplar
   signs introduced by Origen can be relied on for the reconstruction of
   the LXX." Again, M. Berger [249] has called attention to the prominence
   of Lucianic readings in certain Old Latin texts; and the fact that a
   Lucianic element is widely distributed in Old Latin MSS. and quotations
   has also been recognised by Vercellone [250] and Ceriani [251] . This
   element is found even in the African text [252] , and its occurrence
   there suggests that the Antiochian recension, though it was made at the
   beginning of the fourth century, has preserved ancient readings which
   existed also in the African copies of the LXX., though they found no
   place in our oldest codices.

   We proceed to give a list of the extant remains of the Old Latin
   Version of the LXX., and the editions in which they are accessible.

   and Studies, iii. 1). See also the Collatio Carthaginiensis printed in
   Dupin's Optatus (Paris, 1700), p. 379 ff.

   (2) Latin versions of the LXX. revised or taken over by Jerome.

   The great Pannonian scholar, Eusebius Hieronymus (A.D. 329-- 420),
   began his "useful labours [261] " upon the Old Testament at Rome about
   the year 383, probably (as in the case of his revision of the Gospels)
   at the suggestion of the Roman Bishop Damasus ( 384). His first attempt
   was limited to a revision of the Latin Psalter and conducted on lines
   which afterwards seemed to him inadequate. A few years later--but
   before 390-- 1, when he began to translate from the Hebrew--a fresh
   revision of the Psalter from the LXX. was undertaken at the desire of
   Paula and Eustochium; its immediate purpose was to remove errors which
   had already found their way into the copies of the earlier work, but
   the opportunity was seized of remodelling the Latin Psalter after the
   example of the Hexapla.

   Praef. in libr. Psalmorum: "psalterium Romae dudum positum emendaram et
   iuxta LXX. interpretes, licet cursim, magna illud ex parte correxeram.
   quod quia rursum videtis, o Paula et Eustochium, scriptorum vitio
   depravatum, plusque antiquum errorem quam novam emendationem valere,
   cogitis ut . . . renascentes spinas eradicem. . . . . notet sibi
   unusquisque vel iacentem lineam vel signa radiantia, id est vel obelos
   ( ) vel asteriscos ( ); et ubicunque viderit virgulam praecedentem ( ),
   ab ea usque ad duo puncta (:) quae impressimus, sciat in LXX.
   translatoribus plus haberi; ubi autem stellae ( ) similitudinem
   perspexerit, de Hebraeis voluminibus additum noverit aeque usque ad duo
   puncta, iuxta Theodotionis dumtaxat editionem qui simplicitate sermonis
   a LXX. interpretibus non discordat."

   These two revised Latin Psalters were afterwards known as Psalterium
   Romanum and Psalterium Gallicanum respectively. Both recensions
   established themselves in the use of the Latin Church [262] , the
   former in the cursus psallendi, the latter in the bibliotheca or Church
   Bible. At length Pius V. ( 1572) ordered the Gallican Psalter to be
   sung in the daily offices, an exception being made in favour of St
   Peter's at Rome, St Mark's at Venice, and the churches of the
   Archdiocese of Milan, which retained the 'Roman' Psalter [263] . In
   MSS. of the Vulgate a triple Psalter not infrequently appears, shewing
   Jerome's two Septuagintal revisions side by side with the Psalterium
   Hebraicum, his later translation from the Hebrew; but the 'Hebrew'
   Psalter never succeeded in displacing the Hieronymian revisions of the
   Old Latin, and the Latin Church still sings and reads a version of the
   Psalms which is based on the Septuagint. The liturgical Psalter of the
   Anglican Church "followeth . . . the Translation of the Great English
   Bible, set forth and used in the time of King Henry the Eighth, and
   Edward the Sixth"; i.e. it is based on Coverdale's version, which was
   "translated out of Douche and Latyn into Englishe"; and many of its
   peculiarities may be traced to the LXX. through the Gallican Psalter
   incorporated in the Vulgate [264] .

   The following specimen (Ps. lxvii=lxviii. 12-14, 18-22) will enable the
   reader to form an idea of the relation between Jerome's two revisions
   of the Old Latin and his 'Hebrew' [265] Psalter.

   The book of Job offered a still more promising field for the labours of
   the Hexaplarising reviser, for the Greek text as known to Origen fell
   greatly short of the current Hebrew, and it was this defective text
   which formed the basis of the Latin versions used by Cyprian and
   Lucifer and in the Speculum [266] . Jerome, who had access to the
   Hexapla at Caesarea, took advantage of Origen's revision, in which the
   lacunae of the Greek job were filled up from Theodotion, and sent his
   friends, Paula and Eustochium, a Latin version of Job at once corrected
   and supplemented from the Hexaplaric LXX. The result gave him for the
   time profound satisfaction; he had lifted up job from the dunghill
   [267] , and restored him to his pristine state [268] ; the difference
   between the Old Latin version and the new seemed to him to be nothing
   short of that which separate falsehood from truth [269] . The asterisks
   shewed that from 700 to 800 lines had been restored to this long
   mutilated book [270] .

   A few brief specimens from Lagarde's text [271] will suffice to shew
   the character of the work.

     x. 4. aut sicut homo perspicit, perspicis? aut sicut videt homo,
     videbis? aut humana est vita tua? aut anni tui sunt tanquam dies
     hominis?

     xix. 17 et rogabam uxorem meam invocabam blandiens filios uteri mei
     ; at illi in perpetuum despexerunt me; cum surrexero, locuntur ad
     me.

     xlii. 7 et defunctus est job senex plenus dierum. scriptum est autem
     resurrecturum cum his quos Dominus suscitabit.

   Jerome also revised from the Hexaplaric Septuagint, for the benefit of
   Paula and Eustochium, the 'books of Solomon' (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
   Canticles), treating the Greek text after the manner of Origen; but his
   work has perished, the preface alone surviving. A like fate has
   overtaken a translation of Chronicles, undertaken at the desire of
   Domnio and Rogatianus. This version of Chronicles appears from the
   preface to have been influenced by Jerome's Hebrew studies, which were
   now sufficiently matured to enable him to form an independent judgement
   in reference to the merits of his Greek text, though he still clung to
   his old belief in the inspiration of the original Septuagint.

   Praef. in libros Salomonis: "tres libros Salomonis, id est, Proverbia,
   Ecclesiasten, Canticum canticorum, veteri LXX. auctoritati reddidi, vel
   antepositis lineis ( ) superflua quaeque designans, vel stellis ( )
   titulo (?) praenotatis ea quae minus habebantur interserens . . . et
   ubi praepostero ordine atque perverso sententiarum fuerat lumen ereptum
   suis locis restituens feci intellegi quod latebat" Praef. in libr.
   Paralipomenon: "cum a me nuper litteris flagitassetis ut vobis librum
   Paralipomenon Latino sermone transferrem, de Tiberiade legis quondam
   doctorem qui apud Hebraeos admirationi habebatur assumpsi . . . et sic
   confirmatus ausus sum facere quod iubebatis. libere enim vobis loquor,
   ita et in Graecis et Latinis codicibus hic nominum liber vitiosus est
   ut non tam Hebraea quam barbara quaedam . . . arbitrandum sit. nec hoc
   LXX. interpretibus qui Spiritu sancto pleni ea quae vera fuerant
   transtulerunt, sed scriptorum culpae adscribendum. . . . ubicunque ergo
   asteriscos . . . videritis ibi sciatis de Hebraeo additum . . . ubi
   vero obelus, transversa scilicet virga, praeposita est, illic signatur
   quid LXx. interpretes addiderint."

   Whether Jerome dealt with the rest of the canonical books of the Old
   Latin in the same manner must remain an open question. No trace remains
   either of such revised versions or of prefaces which once belonged to
   them, nor does he refer to them in the prefaces of his translations
   from the Hebrew. On the other hand his letters occasionally speak of
   his revision of the Old Latin in terms which seem to imply that it was
   complete, and in one of them there is a passage which suggests that the
   disappearance of the other books was due to the dishonesty of some
   person whose name is not given.

   Adv. Rufin. ii. 24: "egone contra LXX. interpretes aliquid sum locutus
   quos ante annos plurimos diligentissime emendatos meae linguae
   studiosis dedi?" Ep. 71 (ad Lucinium): "LXX. editionem et te habere non
   dubito." Ep. 106 (ad Sunn. et Fret.): "editionem LXX. interpretum quae
   et in hexaplois codicibus reperitur et a nobis in Latinum sermonem
   fideliter versa est." Cf. Ep. Augustini ad Hieron. (116), (c. 405):
   "mittas obsecro interpretationem tuam de LXX. quam te edidisse
   nesciebam." At a later time (c. 416) Jerome excuses himself from doing
   as Augustine had desired, since "pleraque prioris laboris fraude
   cuiusdam amisimus" (Ep. 134).

   In any case Jerome's Hexaplarised version had little or no influence on
   the text of the Latin Bible, except in the Psalter. Even his
   translations from the Hebrew did not easily supersede the Old Latin.
   The familiar version died hard and, as the list of MSS. will have
   shewn, parts of it were copied as late as the seventh century. Even at
   Rome the old version long held its ground by the side of the new; in
   the last years of the sixth century, Gregory the Great, while basing
   his great commentary on Job upon the Vulgate, claimed a right to cite
   the Old Latin when it served his purpose, "quia sedes apostolica
   utrique nititur [272] ."

   The coexistence of the two versions naturally produced mixture in the
   MSS. [273] , which was not altogether removed by the revisions of the
   sixth and ninth centuries. Moreover, the Old Latin version continued to
   hold its place in those books of the Church Bible which had no Semitic
   original, or of which the Semitic original was no longer current. In
   the preface to the Salomonic Books Jerome says explicitly: "porro in eo
   libro qui a plerisque Sapientia Salomonis inscribitur et in
   Ecclesiastico . . . calamo temperavi, tantummodo canonicas scripturas
   vobis emendare desiderans." The books of Tobit and Judith [274] were
   afterwards translated by him from the Aramaic (praeff. in librum
   Tobiae, in librum Judith), and these versions have been incorporated in
   the Vulgate, but the Vulgate Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, 1, 2
   Maccabees are supplied from ante-Hieronymian sources. Thus to this day
   a considerable part of the Latin Bible is in greater or less degree an
   echo of the Septuagint.

    2. THE EGYPTIAN VERSIONS.

   The tradition of St Mark's episcopate at Alexandria [275] may be taken
   as evidence, so far as it goes, of the early planting of the Church in
   that city. The first converts were doubtless, as at Rome,
   Greek-speaking Jews, descendants of the old Jewish settlers [276] , and
   their Greek proselytes; and the first extension of the movement was
   probably amongst the Greek population of the towns on the sea-coast of
   the Mediterranean. As it spread to the interior, to the villages of the
   Delta, to Memphis, Oxyrhynchus, Panopolis, and eventually to Thebes, it
   encountered native Egyptians who spoke dialects of the Egyptian tongue
   [277] . How soon they were evangelised there is no direct evidence to
   shew, but the process may have begun shortly after the Gospel reached
   Alexandria. The native Church retained its own tongue, and in the
   fourth and fifth centuries Greek was still unknown to many of the monks
   and ecclesiastics of Egypt. Christianity however is probably
   responsible for either introducing or spreading the use of a new system
   of writing with characters which are chiefly of Greek origin [278] .
   This writing, known as Coptic--a corruption of Aiguptios--is found with
   some variations in all MS. fragments of the Egyptian versions of the
   Old and New Testaments.

   The analogy of the Old Latin would lead us to suppose (as Bp Lightfoot
   remarks [279] ) that no long interval passed between the acceptance of
   Christianity by any large number of native Egyptians, and the first
   attempts to translate the Scriptures into the Egyptian tongue. "We
   should probably not be exaggerating if we placed one or both of the
   principal Egyptian versions, the Bohairic and the Sahidic, or at least
   parts of them, before the close of the second century." The Bishop is
   writing with only the New Testament in view, but his argument applies
   equally to the Old. His view is on the whole supported by Dr Hort [280]
   , Ciasca [281] , and Mr A. C. Headlam [282] : but Mr Forbes Robinson,
   following Guidi, produces reasons for regarding it as 'not proven,' and
   prefers to say that "historical evidence . . . on the whole, points to
   the third century as the period when the first Coptic translation was
   made." "But this view," he adds, "can only be regarded as tentative. In
   the light of future discoveries it may have to be modified [283] ."

   The plurality of the Egyptian versions is well ascertained. Perhaps the
   geographical form of Egypt gave special opportunities for the growth of
   popular dialects; certain it is that increased knowledge of the
   language has added to the dialectic complications with which the Coptic
   scholar has to struggle [284] . It was in these popular dialects that
   the translations of the Bible were made. "Christianity . . . was in
   Egypt a great popular movement . . . the Scriptures were translated,
   not into the literary language, but into that of the people; and the
   copies of these translations in each locality reflected the local
   peculiarities of speech." Fragments of Biblical versions have been
   found in the Bohairic [285] , Sahidic, and Middle Egyptian dialects.
   The Bohairic dialect was spoken in Lower, the Sahidic in Upper, Egypt,
   and the Middle Egyptian in the intermediate province of Memphis. Some
   authorities speak of two other dialects, the Fayumic and Akhmimic,
   assigning to them certain Biblical fragments which are regarded by
   others as belonging to the Middle Egyptian.

   Translations of books of the Old Testament into these Egyptian dialects
   were naturally made from the Alexandrian Greek version, and, if we may
   judge from the extensive use of the Old Testament in early Christian
   teaching, there is no reason to doubt that they were translated at as
   early a date as the Gospels and Epistles, if not indeed before them.
   Portions of the Old Testament exist in each of the Egyptian dialects.
   Hyvernat mentions fragments of Isaiah, Lamentations and Ep. of Jeremiah
   in Fayumic and Middle Egyptian, and of Exodus, Sirach, 2 Macc., and
   each of the Minor Prophets in Akhmimic [286] ; in Bohairic he
   enumerates 6 MSS. of the Pentateuch, 14 of the Psalms, 5 of Proverbs, 3
   of Job, 4 of the Minor Prophets, 5 of Isaiah, 3 of Jeremiah, 4 of
   Daniel, and one MS. of Ezekiel; in Sahidic, though few complete MSS. of
   any Biblical book have survived, there is a large number of extant
   fragments representing most of the canonical books and certain of the
   non-canonical (the two Wisdoms, the Ep. of Jeremiah, and the Greek
   additions to Daniel).


   The following list gives the more important publications which contain
   portions of the Old Testament in the Egyptian versions.

   It may reasonably be expected that the Egyptian versions of the Old
   Testament; when they have been more fully recovered and submitted to
   examination by experts, will prove to be of much importance for the
   criticism of the text of the LXX. Ceriani [288] has shewn that the
   Greek text of Cod. Marchalianus agrees generally with that which
   underlies the Bohairic version of the Prophets, whilst both are in
   harmony with the text which is quoted by Cyril of Alexandria. A German
   scholar [289] , starting with the Bohairic Prophets, finds that their
   text is similar to that of the Codex Alexandrinus, the Codex
   Marchalianus, a series of cursive Greek MSS., some of which had been
   recognised by Cornill [290] as Hesychian (22, 23, 26, 36, 40, 42, 49,
   51, 62, 86, 91, 95, 97, 106, 114, 130, 147, 153, 185, 228, 233, 238,
   240, 310, 311), and the Greek columns of the Complutensian Polyglott.
   Of the Sahidic fragments, Job is perhaps "a translation of Origen's
   revised text, with the passages under asterisk omitted [291] ," whilst
   Isaiah is distinctly Hexaplaric, and traces of the influence of the
   Hexapla are also to be found in Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Ezekiel,
   although in varying degrees. On the whole it is natural to expect the
   Hesychian recension to be specially reflected in Egyptian versions. But
   other influences may have been at work [292] , and much remains to be
   done before these versions can be securely used in the work of
   reconstructing the text of the Greek Old Testament [293] .

    3. THE ETHIOPIC VERSION.

   Ethiopia is said to have been evangelised in the fourth century from
   Tyre. The Tyrian missionaries were probably of Greek speech [294] , and
   brought with them the Greek Bible. But apart from this, the contiguity
   of Ethiopia to Egypt, and the circumstance that the first Bishop of
   Auxume received consecration at Alexandria, create an a priori
   probability that any early translations from the Old Testament into
   Ethiopic were based upon the Septuagint, whether immediately or through
   the Coptic versions.

   Dillmann, who at one time had explained the numerous transliterations
   and other approaches to the Hebrew in the existing Ethiopic version by
   assuming that the translators worked upon a Hexaplaric text, ultimately
   found cause to classify the MSS. under three heads, (1) those which on
   the whole represent the text of the LXX. on which he supposed the
   version to have been based; (2) those of a later recension--the most
   numerous class--corrected by other MSS. of the LXX.; (3) those in which
   the original version has been revised from the Hebrew [295] . Lagarde,
   on the other hand, suggested that the version was translated from the
   Arabic, as late as the fourteenth century, and maintained that in any
   case the printed texts of the Ethiopic Old Testament depend upon MSS.
   which are too late and too bad to furnish a secure basis for the
   employment of this version in the reconstruction of the Septuagint
   [296] . "These suggestions are not however supported by a closer
   examination of the Ethiopic version of the Octateuch. The text as
   printed by Dillmann, and especially the readings of the oldest MS. he
   used, which is supported by a dated thirteenth century MS. brought from
   Abyssinia to Paris since his edition was published, betray direct
   descent from a Septuagint text of a somewhat interesting type, which
   had apparently undergone less Hebrew or hexaplar revision than the
   Greek ancestors of the Armenian and Syro-hexaplar versions. We are safe
   in concluding with Charles, 'It is unquestionable that our version was
   made in the main from the Greek [297] .'"

   The Ethiopic version of the Old Testament contains all the books of the
   Alexandrian canon except 1-- 4. Maccabees, together with certain
   apocrypha which are not found in MSS. of the LXX. (Enoch, the Book of
   Jubilees, 4 Esdras, &c.). A considerable part of it has appeared in
   print. Dillmann edited the Octateuch and the four books of Kingdoms
   (1853-- 71), and the deuterocanonical books (1894); the book of Joel
   appeared in Merx, Die Prophetie des Joels, the book of Jonah in W.
   Wright's Jonah in four Semitic versions (London, 1857). The Psalms were
   printed by Ludolf (1701), Rödiger (1815), Dorn (1825), and Jeremiah,
   Lamentations and Malachi by Bachmann (1893); Bachmann also edited the
   Dodecapropheton, and part of Isaiah.


   Lists of the MSS, may be seen in Wright, Ethiopic MSS. of the British
   Museum (London, 1878); Zotenberg, Catalogue des MSS. éthiopiens de la
   Bibliothèque Nationale (Paris, 1877); D'Abbadie, Catalogue raisonné de
   MSS. éthiopiens (Paris, 1859); Dillmann, Catalogus MSS. Aethiop. in

   Wien (ZDMG. xvi. p. 554). For fuller information as to this Version see
   F. Prätorius, Urtext, p. 147 ff.

    4. THE ARABIC VERSION.

   The Arabic Old Testament printed in the Paris and London Polyglotts is
   a composite work, the Hexateuch being a translation from the Hebrew,
   and the books of Judges, Ruth, 1 Regn. i.--2 Regn. xii. 17, Nehemiah
   i.--ix. 27, and Job from the Peshitta; the Septuagint has supplied the
   basis for the other poetical books and for the Prophets [298] . Some of
   the MSS. exhibit in certain books a translation which has come from the
   LXX. through the Coptic; the book of Job in this version has been
   published by Lagarde (Psalterium Job Proverbia arabice, Göttingen,
   1876) [299] .

   The Arabic version directly derived from the LXX. is said to exhibit in
   the Prophets a text akin to that of Cod. A (Ryssel, in ZA W. 1885, p.
   102 ff., 158). It shews traces of Hexaplaric influence (H. Hyvernat, in
   Vigouroux, D. B. i. p. 846).


   EDITIONS of Arabic versions of the Septuagint. Besides the Polyglotts
   (Paris, 1645; London, 1652), mention may be made of the Psalters
   published at Genoa, 1516; Rome, 1614 and 1619; Aleppo, 1706; London
   (S.P.C.K.), 1725. In W. Wright's Book of Jonah the Arabic is from a MS.
   in the Bodleian (see p. vii.). Cf. H. Hyvernat, op. cit.

    5. THE SYRIAC VERSIONS.

   According to Moses bar-Cephas ( 913), there are two Syriac versions of
   the Old Testament--the Peshitta, translated from the Hebrew in the time
   of King Abgar, and the version made from the Septuagint by Paul, Bishop
   of Tella. This statement is neither complete nor altogether to be
   trusted, but it may serve as a convenient point of departure for a
   summary of the subject.

   (1) The origin of the Peshitta is still as obscure as when Theodore of
   Mopsuestia wrote: hermeneutai de tauta eis men ten ton Suron par hotou
   depote, oude gar egnostai mechri tes temeron hostis pote houtos estin
   [300] . That the translation on the whole was made from the Hebrew is
   the verdict of modern scholars as it was that of Moses bar-Cephas. Yet
   certain books display the influence of the LXX. While "the Pentateuch
   follows the Hebrew text and the Jewish exegesis, Isaiah and the twelve
   Minor Prophets contain much which is from the LXX., and the influence
   of the Greek version appears to have been felt also in the Psalter
   [301] ." From the first the Peshitta seems to have included the
   non-canonical books of the Alexandrian Bible except 1 Esdras and Tobit,
   "and their diction agrees with that of the canonical books among which
   they are inserted [302] ."

   (2) The Syriac version ascribed to Paul, Bishop of Telladhe-Mauzelath
   (Constantine) in Mesopotamia, was a literal translation of the LXX. of
   the Hexapla, in which the Origenic signs were scrupulously retained. A
   note in one of the rolls of this version assigns it to the year 616--
   7; the work is said to have been produced at Alexandria under the
   auspices of Athanasius, Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch, who with five
   of his suffragans had gone thither to visit the Alexandrian Patriarch.
   Paul of Tella and Thomas of Harkel appear to have been of the party,
   and their visit in Alexandria led to the translation of the entire
   Greek Bible into Syriac, the New Testament having been undertaken by
   Thomas, while Paul worked upon the Old [303] .

   The version of Paul of Tella, usually called the Syro-Hexaplar, was
   first made known to Europe by Andreas Masius (Andrew Du Maes, 1573). In
   editing the Greek text of Joshua he used a Syriac MS. which contained
   part of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Esther,
   Judith, and part of Tobit, in this translation. The codex which he
   employed has disappeared, but the Ambrosian library at Milan possesses
   another, possibly a second volume of the lost MS., which contains the
   poetical and prophetic books, in the order Psalms, Job, Proverbs,
   Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, the two Wisdoms, the twelve Prophets,
   Jeremiah (with Baruch, Lamentations, and the Epistle), Daniel (with
   Susanna and Bel), Ezekiel, Isaiah. Portions of the historical books of
   the Syro-Hexaplar [304] have been discovered among the Nitrian MSS. of
   the British Museum, and a catena, also at the Museum, contains
   fragments of Chronicles and the books of Esdras, while the Paris
   Library contributes 4 Kingdoms. Norberg edited Jeremiah and Ezekiel in
   1787; Daniel was published by Bugati in 1788 and the Psalms in 1820;
   Middeldorpf completed the prophetical and poetical books in his edition
   of 1835, and in 1861 Ceriani added Baruch, Lamentations, and the Ep. of
   Jeremiah. Of the historical books Judges and Ruth were published by
   Skat Rördam in 1861, and Genesis and Exodus (i.--xxxiii. 2) by Ceriani
   (Mon. sacr. et prof. ii.), who has also given to the world the Milan
   fragments in Mon. vol. vii.

   The Hexapla, Tetrapla, and occasionally the Heptapla, are mentioned as
   the sources of the text in the subscriptions to the books of the
   Syro-Hexaplar. These subscriptions were doubtless translated with the
   rest of the Greek archetypes, but they shew the character of the copies
   employed by the translators. The version is servile to such an extent
   as sometimes to violate the Syriac idiom [305] . It is obvious that
   this extreme fidelity to the Greek, while it must have hindered the use
   of the version in the Monophysite churches of Syria, is of vast
   advantage to the Biblical critic. It places in his hands an exact
   reflexion of the Hexaplaric LXX. as it was read at Alexandria at the
   beginning of the 7th century, derived ultimately from the Hexapla and
   Tetrapla through the recession of Eusebius. Thus it supplements our
   scanty stock of Greek Hexaplaric MSS., and indeed forms our chief
   authority for the text of Origen's revision. In the case of one of the
   canonical books the version of Paul of Tella renders even greater
   service. One of the Greek texts of Daniel--that which Origen regarded
   as the true Septuagintal text--has survived only in a single and
   relatively late MS. The Syro-Hexaplar here supplies another and earlier
   authority, which enables us to check the testimony of the Chigi Greek.


   (3) Other Syriac versions made from the Greek.


   (a) Fragments of a Syriac version in the Palestinian dialect have been
   printed by Land, Anecdota Syriaca, iv. (Leyden, 1875), J. R. Harris,
   Biblical Fragments from Mt Sinai (London, 1890), G. H. Gwilliam,
   Anecdota Oxoniensia, Semitic Series, I. v., ix. (Oxford, 1893-- 6), G.
   Margoliouth, Liturgy of the Nile (London, 1897), and Mrs Lewis, Studia
   Sinaitica, vi. (London, 1897) [306] . This version has been made from
   the LXX.; in the Books of Kings the text is now known not to be
   Lucianic, as it was at first supposed to be (Anecd. Oxon. ix. p. 32);
   in the Greater Prophets, it is in part at least Origenic (Studia
   Sinaitica, pp. xvi., lxiii.); Job seems to have contained the
   interpolations from Theodotion which are found in the extant Greek
   texts of that book [307] .


   The following is a complete list of the Palestinian fragments included
   in the publications mentioned above: Gen. i. 1-- iii.-- 24, vi. 9-- ix.
   19, xviii. 1-- 5, 18-- xix. 30, xxii. 1-- 19; Ex. viii. 22^b-- xi. 10,

   Zech. ix. 9-- 15, xi. 11^b-- 14; Isa. iii. 9^b-- 15, vii. 10-- 16,
   viii. 8-- xi. 16, xii. 1-- 6, xiv. 28-- 32, xv. 1-- 5, xxv. 1-- 3^a,

   4-- 9, lii. 13-- liii. 12, lx. 1-- 22, lxi. 1-- 11, lxiii. 1-- 7; Jer.
   xi. 18-- 20 [308] .


   (b) Mention is made [309] of a version of the Greek Old Testament
   attempted by the Nestorian Patriarch Mar Abbas (A.D. 552). But
   notwithstanding the declared preference of Theodore for the LXX., the
   Nestorians have always used the Peshitta, and there is no extant
   Nestorian version from the Greek.

   (c) Of Jacobite versions from the LXX. there were several. (1) Polycarp
   the chorepiscopus, who in the fifth century laboured upon a translation
   of the New Testament under the auspices of Philoxenus, the Monophysite
   Bishop of Mabug, is known to have rendered the Greek Psalter into
   Syriac. The margin of the Syro-Hexaplar [310] mentions a Philoxenian
   'edition' of Isaiah, to which two fragments printed by Ceriani [311]
   from the British Museum MS. Add. 17106 are believed to belong. The text
   of these fragments agrees on the whole with that of the Lucianic MSS.
   of the Prophets. (2) Another Monophysite, Jacob of Edessa, applied
   himself in 704-- 5 to the revision of the Syriac Old Testament, using
   for the purpose the Hexaplaric LXX. [312] , and the fragments of the
   other Greek translations. Some books of this revised version exist in
   MS. at London and Paris [313] , and a few specimens have been printed
   [314] .

   (d) From Melito downwards the Greek fathers refer occasionally to the
   Greek renderings of an interpreter who is called ho Suros The student
   will find in Field's prolegomena a full and learned discussion of the
   question who this Syrian interpreter was. Field inclines to the opinion
   that he was a bilingual Syrian, of Greek origin, who translated into
   Greek from the Peshitta [315] .

    6. THE GOTHIC VERSION.

   About the year 350 a translation of the Bible into the Gothic tongue
   was made by Ulfilas (Wulfila) [317] , the descendant of a Cappadocian
   captive who had been brought up among the Goths in Dacia, and was in
   341 consecrated Bishop of the Gothic nation, which was then beginning
   to embrace Arian Christianity. According to Philostorgius he translated
   the whole of the Old Testament except the books of Kingdoms, which he
   omitted as likely to inflame the military temper of the Gothic race by
   their records of wars and conquests (Philostorg. loc. cit.: metephrasen
   eis ten auton phonen tas graphas hapasas plen ge de ton Basileion hate
   ton men polemon historian echouson, toude ethnous ontos philopolemou).
   Unfortunately only a few scanty fragments of the Gothic Old Testament
   have been preserved, i.e., some words from Gen. v. 3-- 30, Ps. lii. 2--
   3, 2 Esdr. xv. 13-- 16, xvi. 14-- xvii. 3, xvii. 13-- 45. With the
   exception of the scrap from Genesis, they are derived from palimpsest
   fragments belonging to the Ambrosian Library which were discovered by
   Mai in 1817 and subsequently published at Milan by Mai and Castiglione;
   and they are printed in the great collection of Gabelentz and Loebe
   (Ulfilas: V. et N. Testamenti . . . fragmenta, Lipsiae, 1843) and in
   Migne P. L. xviii.; more recent editions are those of Uppstrom, Upsala,
   1854-- 7; Massmann, Stuttgart 1855-- 7; Stamm, Paderborn, 1865;
   Bernhardt, Halle, 1875, 1884; G. H. Balg, The First Germanic Bible,
   Milwaukee, 1891; Stamm-Heyne, 1896.

   Lagarde (Librorum V T. canonicorum pars i., p. xiv., 1883) shews by an
   examination of the Esdras fragments that Ulfilas probably used MSS. of
   the Lucianic recension, and the same view is held by A. Kisch, Der
   Septuaginta-Codex des Ulfilas (Monatschrift f. Gesch. u. W. des
   Judenthums, 1873), and F. Kauffmann, Beiträge zur Quellenkritik d.
   gothischen Bibelübersetzung (Z. f. d. Phil. 1896). Ulfilas was in
   Constantinople for some time about 340, and his MSS. of the LXX. were
   doubtless obtained in that city, which according to Jerome was one of
   the headquarters of the Lucianic LXX. ("Constantinopolis usque
   Antiochiam Luciani martyris exemplaria probat").

    7. THE ARMENIAN VERSION.

   Armenian writers of the fifth century ascribe the inception of the
   Armenian Bible to Mesrop (354-- 441) and his associates. The book of
   Proverbs was the first translated, whether because it stood first in
   the volume [318] on which the translators worked, or because its gnomic
   character gave it a special importance in their eyes. The work is said
   to have been begun at Edessa, but MSS. were afterwards obtained from
   Constantinople; and Moses of Khoren, a nephew and pupil of Mesrop, was
   despatched to Alexandria to study Greek in order to secure "a more
   accurate articulation and division" [319] of the text. Moses indeed
   affirms that the earliest translations of the O.T. into Armenian were
   from the Syriac, and his statement receives some confirmation from the
   mention of Edessa as the place of origin, and from the circumstance
   that Syriac was the Church-language of Armenia before the introduction
   of the Armenian alphabet [320] . On the other hand the existing
   Armenian version is clearly Septuagintal. It fits the Greek of the LXX.
   "as a glove the hand that wears it"; keeping so close to the Greek that
   it "has almost the same value for us as the Greek text itself from
   which (the translator) worked would possess [321] ." But, as Lagarde
   has pointed out [322] , the printed text is untrustworthy, and the
   collation made for Holmes and Parsons cannot be regarded as
   satisfactory. A fresh collation will be made for the larger edition of
   the Cambridge Septuagint [323] .

   The order of the books of the O.T. in Armenian MSS., as given by
   Conybeare [324] (Octateuch, 1--4 Regn., 1--2 Paralipp., 1 and 2 Esdr.,
   Esther, Judith, Tobit, 1--3 Macc., Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
   Canticles, Wisdom, Job [325] , Isaiah, the Minor Prophets, Jeremiah,
   with Baruch and Lamentations, Daniel, Ezekiel) is on the whole
   consistent with the grouping found in the oldest Greek authorities
   [326] , and seems to point to the use by the translators of good early
   codices.


   MSS. Few codices of the entire Bible are earlier than the 13th century;
   one at Edschmiatzin belongs to the year 1151. Holmes assigns his Arm. 3
   to A.D. 1063, but according to Conybeare it is a MS. of the eighteenth
   century.


   EDITIONS. Venice (Psalter), 1565; Amsterdam, 1666; Constantinople,
   1705; Venice, 1805 (the first edition which is of any critical value,
   by J. Zohrab); Venice, 1859-- 60 (by the Mechitarist fathers of San
   Lazzaro).

    8. THE GEORGIAN VERSION.

   The origin of this version is obscure. According to Moses of Khoren,
   the Georgian as well as the Armenian version was the work of Mesrop.
   Iberia seems to have received the Gospel early in the fourth century,
   if not before; but it may have possessed no translation of the
   Scriptures until the movement initiated in Armenia by Mesrop had
   communicated itself to the neighbouring region. That the Georgian Old
   Testament was based upon the Greek is said to be manifest from the
   transliteration of Greek words which it contains.


   MSS. A Psalter of cent. vii.--viii. is preserved at the monastery of St
   Catherine's, Mt Sinai, and at Athos there is a MS., dated 978, which
   originally contained the whole Bible, but has lost Lev. xii.--Joshua.
   Both the Sinai library and the Patriarchal library at Jerusalem are
   rich in Georgian MSS.


   EDITIONS. The Georgian Bible was printed at Moscow in 1743 and at St
   Petersburg in 1816 and 1818; the Moscow edition is said to have been
   adapted to the Russian Church Bible.

   de la Bibliothèque Nationale à Paris (without place or date, ? 1898).

    9. THE SLAVONIC VERSION.

   The Greek Bible was translated into Slavonic by the brothers Cyril and
   Methodius, from whom in the ninth century the Slavs received the faith.
   Of the Old Testament the Psalter alone was finished before the death of
   Cyril, but according to contemporary testimony Methodius brought the
   work to completion. As a whole this original version no longer exists,
   the codices having perished in the Tartar invasion of the thirteenth
   century; and the fragments of the Old Testament of Cyril and Methodius
   which are embedded in the present Slavonic Bible are "so mixed up with
   later versions as to be indistinguishable [327] ." The existing version
   has not been made uniformly from the Greek. Esther was translated from
   the Hebrew, while Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, and certain other
   books, were rendered from the Latin Vulgate in the fifteenth century.
   On the other hand the Octateuch, the books of Kingdoms, and the
   poetical books are from the Greek, and some of them, especially the
   Octateuch, contain old materials probably due, at least in part, to the
   work of Cyril and Methodius.

   A Psalter in the Glagolitic script, preserved at Sinai, has been edited
   by Geitler (Agram, 1883); and there is a critical edition of the
   Slavonic Psalter by Amphilochius (Moscow, 1874-- 9).

   So far as the Slavonic Old Testament is based on the LXX., its text is
   doubtless Lucianic; cf. Lagarde, Praef. in Libr. V. T. can. i. p. xv.
   "ni omnia fallunt Slavus nihil aliud vertit nisi Luciani recensionem,"
   and Leskien in Urtext, p. 215, "dass im allgemeinen der
   Kirchenslavischen Übersetzung der griech. Text der Lucianischen
   (Antiochenisch-Konstantinopolitanischen) Rezension zu Grunde liegt ist
   sicher."

  CHAPTER V.

    MANUSCRIPTS OF THE SEPTUAGINT.

   THE great edition of the Septuagint published by Holmes and Parsons
   ends with a complete list of the MSS. employed (vol. v. ad fin.,
   addenda). It enumerates 311 codices (I--XIII., 14--311), of which
   I.--XIII., 23, 27, 39, 43, 156, 188, 190, 258, 262, are written in
   uncial letters, or partly so, while the rest are in minuscule or
   cursive hands. Since 1827, the date of the publication of the last
   volume of the Oxford edition, the list of available codices or
   fragments has been largely increased, owing partly to the researches
   and publications of Tischendorf, partly to the progress which has
   recently been made in the examination and cataloguing of Eastern
   libraries, and the discovery in Egypt of fragments of papyrus bearing
   Biblical texts. In this chapter an effort has been made to present the
   student with a complete list of all the MSS. which have been or are
   being used by editors of the LXX., and of the important fragments so
   far as they are known to us. It is, however, impossible to guarantee
   either the exhaustiveness or the correctness in regard to minor details
   of information which has been brought together from many sources and
   cannot be verified by enquiry at first hand.


   SYSTEMS OF NOTATION. Two systems have been used to denote the uncial
   MSS. Holmes employed Roman numerals; Lagarde, the capitals of the Roman
   alphabet [328] . For the cursive MSS. Holmes used Arabic numerals,
   beginning with 14; but, as we have seen, several uncials were allowed
   to take rank among them. Later scholars have for the most part retained
   this method of notation for the cursives, excepting in the case of a
   few groups which are supposed to represent a particular recension; thus
   Lagarde adopted the symbols f h m p z for the Lucianic MSS. 82, 93,
   118, 44 [329] , whilst Cornill with a similar object substituted the
   small letters of the Greek alphabet for the Arabic numerals [330] .
   Uniformity in this matter can scarcely be expected until the cursive
   codices have been thoroughly examined and catalogued; meanwhile it is
   sufficient to call attention to the variety of practice which exists.


   Manuscripts of the LXX., whether uncial or cursive, rarely contain the
   whole of the Greek Old Testament. There are some notable exceptions to
   the general rule (e.g. A, B, C, S = '?, 64, 68, 106, 122, 131, and the
   number of these exceptions may be increased by adding MSS. which have
   been broken up into two or more separate codices (e.g. G, N + V). But
   the majority of the copies seem never to have included more than a
   particular book (as Genesis, or the Psalms, with or without the
   liturgical odai), or a particular group of books such as the Pentateuch
   (he pentateuchos [331] ) or the Octateuch (he oktateuchos =
   Gen.--Ruth), the Historical Books (1 Regn.--2 Esdr., Esth., Judith,
   Tobit), the three or five books ascribed to Solomon, the Minor Prophets
   (to dodekapropheton, the Major Prophets (hoi tessares), or the Prophets
   complete (to hekkaidekapropheton). Larger combinations are also found,
   e.g. Genesis--Tobit, the Poetical Books as a whole, or the Poetical
   Books with the Prophets.

   In reference to the date of their execution, the uncial MSS. of the
   LXX. range from the third century to the tenth, and the cursives from
   the ninth to the sixteenth. Their present distribution may be seen from
   the descriptions; an analysis of the list of Holmes and Parsons gives
   the following general results: Italy, 129; Great Britain and Ireland,
   54; France, 36; Austria, 26; Russia, 23; Germany, 13; Spain, 7;
   Holland, 6; Switzerland, 6; Denmark, 4. This summary conveys a general
   idea of the proportion in which the MSS. of the LXX. were distributed
   among European countries, Greece excepted, at the beginning of the
   nineteenth century. But the balance will be considerably disturbed if
   we add the acquisitions of Tischendorf and other discoverers, and the
   treasures of the libraries at Athens, Athos, Patmos, Smyrna, Jerusalem,
   and Mount Sinai, which are now within the reach of the critical
   student.

   A (III). CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. British Museum, Royal, I. D. v.--viii.


   A MS. of the O. and N. Testaments, with lacunae. The O. T. is defective
   in the following places: Gen. xiv. 14--17, xv. 1--5, 16--19, xvi. 6--9
   (leaf torn across and the lower portion lost); 1 Regn, xii. 18--xiv. 9
   (leaf missing); Ps. xlix. 19--lxxix. 10 (nine leaves missing). Slighter
   defects, due to the tearing of leaves, occur in Gen. i. 20--25, 29--ii.
   3; Lev. viii. 6, 7, 16; Sirach l. 21, 22, li. 5.

   The codex now consists of four volumes, of which the first three
   contain the O. T. in 639 leaves. The books are thus distributed: vol.
   i. Genesis--2 Chronicles; vol. ii. Hosea--4 Maccabees; vol. iii.
   Psalms--Sirach [334] . The first volume begins with a table of the
   Books, in a hand somewhat later than the body of the MS. The Psalter,
   which contains the psalmos idiographos (cli.) and the liturgical
   canticles, is preceded by the Epistle of Athanasius to Marcellinus, the
   hupotheseis of Eusebius, a table, and the canons of the Morning and
   Evening Psalms. The books of vol. iii. are written sticheros.

   The covers of the volumes bear the arms of Charles I. The codex had
   been sent to James I. by Cyril Lucar, patriarch successively of
   Alexandria and Constantinople, but did not reach England till after the
   succession of Charles. It had previously belonged to the Patriarchate
   of Alexandria, as we learn from an Arabic note at the beginning.
   Another but later Arabic note states that the MS. was the work of 'the
   martyr Thecla,' and Cyril Lucar has written on a leaf prefixed to vol.
   i.: "Liber iste . . . prout ego traditione habebam, est scriptus manu
   Theclae nobilis faeminae Aegyptiae ante MCCC annos circiter, paulo post
   concilium Nicaenum." But, apart from palaeographical considerations
   [335] , this date is discredited by the occurrence in the MS. of
   excerpts from the works of Athanasius and Eusebius, and the liturgical
   matter connected with the Psalter. It has been proposed to identify
   Thecla with a correspondent of Gregory of Nazianzus (see THECLA (10),
   D. C. B. iv., p 897); but this later Thecla seems to have belonged to
   Cappadocia, not to Egypt. Portions of the text of cod. A were printed
   by Patrick Young, 1637 (Job), Ussher, 1655 (Judges vi., xviii.), Walton
   in the polyglott of 1657 (facsimile of Ps. i.), Gale, 1678 (Psalter);
   and the MS. was used by Grabe as the basis of his great edition of the
   LXX. (1707--1720 [336] ). Baber in 1812 published the Psalter and in
   1816--1821 the whole of the O. T. in facsimile type. Finally, an
   autotype facsimile, which, as Gregory well says, leaves nothing to be
   desired, was issued in 1881--3 by order of the Trustees of the British
   Museum under the editorship of Mr (now Sir) E. Maunde Thompson, who has
   added brief but valuable prolegomena.

   The codex is written on leaves of fine vellum, arranged in quires
   usually of eight. The writing "varies in different parts of the MS.,
   though sufficient uniformity is maintained to make it difficult to
   decide the exact place where a new hand begins . . . the style of
   writing in vol. iii. is for the most part different from that of the
   other volumes [337] ." In a few of the superscriptions and colophons
   the occurrence of Egyptian forms of the Greek letters has been noted,
   "proving that the MS., if not absolutely written in Egypt, must have
   been immediately afterwards removed thither [338] ." The leaves measure
   about 32 centimetres by 26.3; each leaf contains two columns of 49--51
   lines, the lines usually consisting of 23--25 letters. Except in the
   third volume, the commencement of a new section or paragraph is marked
   by a large initial letter in the margin as well as by paragraph-marks.
   There are no breathings or accents by the first hand; an apostrophe
   occasionally separates words or consonants; here and there an asterisk
   is placed in the margin (e.g. Gen. xli. 19). Punctuation is limited to
   a single point, generally high. The abbreviations which occur are
   and   ,   (kai, mou, sou, -nai, -tai). There are numerous and lengthy
   erasures, over which a corrector has written the text which he
   preferred. The earliest corrector (A¹) was contemporary with the scribe
   or nearly so; the second corrector (A^a) may have lived a century
   later; a third and still later hand (A^b) has also been at work. But
   the question of the 'hands' in this MS. remains to be worked out, and
   calls for the knowledge of an expert in palaeography.


   B (II). CODEX VATICANUS (Vatican Library, Gr. 1209).


   A MS. of the Old and New Testaments, defective at the beginning and in
   some other places. The O. T. has lost its first 31 leaves, the original
   hand beginning at Gen. xlvi. 28 (with the words polin eis gen
   Rhamesse). Through the tearing of fol. 178 2 Regn. ii. 5--7, 10--13,
   has also disappeared, and the loss of 10 leaves after fol. 348 involves
   a lacuna which extends from Ps. cv. (cvi.) 27 to Ps. cxxxvii.
   (cxxxviii.) 6^b. The longer gaps have been filled by a recent hand.

   The present codex is a quarto volume containing 759 leaves, of which
   617 belong to the O. T. Every book of the Greek O. T. is included,
   except 1--4 Maccabees, which never found a place in the MS. The order
   of the books differs from that which is followed in cod. A, the
   poetical books being placed between the canonical histories and the
   Prophets; and there are variations also in the internal arrangement of
   the groups.

   Of the history of this MS. before the sixteenth century nothing is
   certainly known. A Vatican collection of Greek MSS. was already in
   existence in the middle of the fifteenth century, and the greatest
   treasure in the present library was among its earliest acquisitions. It
   finds a place in the early catalogues of the Vatican [339] ; reference
   is made to this MS. in letters addressed by the librarian of the
   Vatican to Erasmus in 1521 and 1533 [340] , and it formed the chief
   authority for the Roman edition of the LXX. in 1587. By this time its
   importance was already recognised, and it is amazing that an interval
   of nearly 300 years should have been allowed to pass before the actual
   text of the MS. was given to the world. A collation of B with the
   Aldine text was made by Bartolocci in 1669, and is still preserved at
   Paris in the Bibliothèque Nationale (MS gr. supplem. 53). With other
   treasures of the Vatican the codex was carried to Paris by Napoleon,
   and there it was inspected in 1809 by Hug, whose book De antiquitate
   codicis Vaticani (Freiburg, 1810) aroused fresh interest in its text.
   On the restoration of the MS. to the Vatican it was guarded with a
   natural but unfortunate jealousy which for more than half a century
   baffled the efforts of Biblical scholars. Neither Tischendorf in 1843
   and 1866 nor Tregelles in 1845 was permitted to make a full examination
   of the codex. Meanwhile the Roman authorities were not unmindful of the
   duty of publishing these treasures, but the process was slow, and the
   first results were disappointing. An edition printed by Mai in 1828--38
   did not see the light till 1857. It was followed in 1881 by Cozza's
   more accurate but far from satisfactory volumes in facsimile type. At
   length in 1890 under the auspices of Leo XIII. the Vatican Press issued
   a photographic reproduction worthy of this most important of Biblical
   MSS. [341]

   The codex is written on the finest vellum in a singularly beautiful
   hand [342] which "may be attributed to the fourth century," and
   probably to the middle of the century [343] , and bears a resemblance
   to the hand which is found in papyri of the best Roman period [344] .
   The leaves are arranged in quinions (gatherings of ten pages); each
   page exhibits three columns of 42 lines with 16--18 letters in each
   line. There are no breathings or accents in the first hand; a point
   occurs but rarely; initial letters do not project into the margin. The
   text is written in two contemporary hands, the transition being made at
   p. 335. The MS. has been corrected more than once; besides the scribe
   or contemporary diorthotes (B^1), we may mention an early corrector
   denoted as B^a, and a late instaurator, who has gone over the whole
   text, spoiling its original beauty, and preserving oftentimes the
   corrections of B^a rather than the original text.


   C. CODEX EPHRAEMI SYRI RESCRIPTUS PARISIENSIS. Bibliothèque Nationale,
   Gr. 9 (formerly Reg. 1905, Colbert. 3769).


   A folio consisting at present of 209 leaves, of which 64 contain
   portions of the O. T. The fragments are as follows: Prov. i. 2

   auto--xlvii. 23 Rhoboam, xlviii. 11--xlix. 12 Iesous huios. The
   distribution of the leaves is Proverbs 6, Ecclesiastes 8, Cant. 1, Job
   19, Wisdom 7, Sirach 23.


   The copy of the Greek Bible of which these fragments have survived
   unfortunately fell during the middle ages into the hands of a scribe in
   want of writing materials. Originally, as it seems, a complete Bible,
   written probably in the fifth century and, as Tischendorf believed, in
   Egypt, in the twelfth century it was taken to pieces, sponged, and used
   for other writings [345] . What became of the missing leaves we do not
   know; those of the Paris volume are covered with the Greek text of
   certain works of Ephrem the Syrian [346] . The book was probably
   brought to Florence early in the 16th century by Andreas Lascaris, the
   agent of Lorenzo de' Medici, and passing into the possession of
   Catharine de' Medici, accompanied her to France, where it found its way
   into the Royal Library. Here the value of the underlying text was
   recognised by Montfaucon, who called attention to it in his
   Palaeografihia Graeca, and gave a specimen from the fragments of the N.
   T. (p. 213 f.). The O. T. fragments were partly examined by Wetstein
   and Thilo [347] , but were not given to the world until in 1845
   Tischendorf, who had published the N. T. portion in 1843, completed his
   task by printing the LXX. text.

   This once noble MS. was written in single columns from 40 to 46 lines
   in length, each line containing about 40 letters [348] . The writing of
   the O. T. differs, according to Tischendorf, from that of the N. T.; it
   is more delicate, some of the letters (A, D, B, K, X, Ch, Ph) assume
   different forms in the two portions of the codex, and there are other
   palaeographical indications that the hand which wrote the earlier books
   did not write the later. Nevertheless Tischendorf regarded the two
   hands as contemporary, and believed the codex to have been originally
   one. A seventh century corrector has left traces of his work, but his
   corrections are not numerous except in Sirach. As to the order of the
   books nothing can be ascertained, the scribe who converted the MS. into
   a palimpsest having used the leaves for his new text without regard to
   their original arrangement [349] .


   S = '. CODEX SINAITICUS. Leipzig and St Petersburg.

   The forty-three leaves containing 1 Par. xi. 22--xix. 17, 2 Esdras ix.
   9--end, Esther, Tobit i. 1--ii. 2, Jer. x. 25--end, and Lam. i. 1--ii.
   20 were found by Tischendorf in a wastepaper basket at the Convent of
   St Catharine's, Mount Sinai, in 1844, and published by him in a
   lithographed facsimile under the name of Codex Friderico-Augustanus
   [350] (Leipzig, 1846); to these in Mon. sacr. ined., nov. coll. i.
   (1855) he was able to add Isa. lxvi. 12--Jer. i. 7 from a copy made
   during the same visit to Sinai. A second visit in 1853 enabled him to
   print in the next volume of the Monumenta (1857) two short fragments of
   Genesis (xxiv. 9, 10, 41--43). During a third visit to the Convent in
   1859, he was permitted to see the rest of the codex, including 156
   1eaves of the Old Testament, and ultimately succeeded in carrying the
   whole to St Petersburg for presentation to the Czar Alexander II. This
   final success led to the publication in 1862 of the Bibliorum Codex
   Sinaiticus Petropolitanus, containing a facsimile of the St Petersburg
   portion of the Sinaitic MS. Lastly in 1867 Tischendorf completed his
   task by printing in his Appendix Codicum certain fragments of Genesis
   and Numbers which had been discovered by the Archimandrite Porfirius in
   the bindings of other Sinai MSS. [351]

   This great Bible was written on leaves which originally measured 15 x
   131 inches, and were gathered, with two exceptions, into quires of
   four. Each column contains 48 lines, with 12--14 letters in a line; and
   in all but the poetical books each page exhibits four columns, so that
   eight lie open at a time [352] ; in the poetical books, where the lines
   are longer, two columns appear on each page, or four at an opening. The
   characters are assigned to the fourth century; they are well-formed and
   somewhat square, written without break, except when an apostrophe or a
   single point intervenes; a breathing prima manu has been noticed at
   Tobit vi. 9, but with this exception neither breathings nor accents
   occur. Tischendorf distinguished four hands in the codex (A, B, C, D),
   and assigned to A the fragments of Chronicles, 1 Macc., and the last 4½
   leaves of 4 Macc., as well as the whole of the N. T.; the fragments of
   Numbers and the Prophets are ascribed to B; the poetical books to C;
   Tobit and Judith and the rest of 4 Macc. to D, who is identified with
   the scribe to whom we owe the N. T. of Codex Vaticanus. He also
   detected traces of five stages in the correction of the MS., which he
   represented by the symbols '^a, '^c.a, '^c.b, '^c.c, '^d. The first
   symbol covers the work of the diorthotes and other nearly contemporary
   correctors; '^c.a, c.b, c.c are three seventh century hands, of which
   the last appears chiefly in the Book of Job, whilst the later '^d has
   occupied itself with retracing faded writing in the Prophets.

   After 1 Chron. xix. 17 cod. ' (FA) passes without break to 2 Esdr. ix.
   9, but the place is marked by the corrector '^c.a with three crosses
   and the note mechri toutou [tou] semeiou ton trion stauron estin to
   telos ton hepta phullon ton perisson kai me onton tou Esdra. Five of
   these leaves remain, and the two which preceded them probably contained
   1 Chron. vi. 50--ix. 27^a (H. St J. Thackeray in Hastings' D.B., i. p.
   762). Westcott (Bible in the Church, p. 307) supposes that the
   insertion of this fragment of 1 Chron. in the heart of 2 Esdras is due
   to a mistake in the binding of the copy from which the MS. was
   transcribed; comp. the similar error in the archetype of all our Greek
   copies of Sirach [353] . Whether 1 Esdras formed a part of cod. ' is
   uncertain, the heading Esdras b' does not prove this, since cod. '
   contains 4 Maccabees under the heading Makkabaion d' although it
   certainly did not give the second and third books (Thackeray, 1.c.).

   No uniform edition or photographic reproduction of this most important
   MS. has yet appeared [354] . The student is still under the necessity
   of extracting the text of ' from the five works of Tischendorf
   mentioned above. A homogeneous edition of the remains of the codex or a
   photographic reproduction of the text is one of our most urgent needs
   in the field of Biblical palaeography. (The N. T. has now appeared in
   collotype; H. and K. Lake, introd. by K. Lake, Oxford, 1911.)


   N (XI). CODEX BASILIANO-VATICANUS. Vatican Library, Gr. 2106, formerly
   Basil. 145 [355] .


   V (23). CODEX VENETUS. St Mark's Library, Venice, cod. Gr. 1 [356] .


   Dr E. Klostermann (Analecta, pp. 9 f., 33 f.) has produced good reasons
   for believing that these two codices originally formed portions of a
   complete copy of the Greek Old Testament.

   The Vatican portion now contains Lev. xiii. 59--Num. xxi. 34, Num.
   xxii. 19--Deut. xxviii. 40, Deut. xxx. 16--Jud. xiv. 16, Jud. xviii.
   2--1 Regn. xvii. 12, 1 Regn. xvii. 31--3 Regn. viii. 8, 3 Regn. xi.
   17--end of 2 Paralip., 2 Esdr. v. 10--xvii. 3, Esther. The Venice MS.
   yields Job xxx. 8 to end, Prov., Eccl., Cant., Sap., Sirach, the Minor
   Prophets (in the order Hos., Am., Joel, Ob., Jon., Mic., Nab., Hab.,
   Zeph., Hag., Zech., Mal.), Isa., Jer., Bar., Lam., Ezek., Daniel,
   Tobit, Judith, 1--4 Macc.

   The Venice folio measures 16½ x 11? inches, the Vatican at present a
   little less, but the breadth and length of the columns is identical in
   the two codices; in both there are two columns of 60 lines. The Venice
   MS. contains 164 leaves, the Vatican 132. The first leaf of the Venice
   book begins the 27th quire of the original MS., and on computation it
   appears that, if to the Vatican leaves were added those which would be
   required to fill the lacunae of the earlier books and of Job, the
   entire number would make up 26 quires of the same size [357] . As
   regards the history of the separated portions, it appears that the
   Vatican MS. was originally brought to Rome from Calabria by a Basilian
   monk [358] ; the Venice book was once the property of Cardinal
   Bessarion, by whom it was presented to St Mark's [359] .

   The handwriting of N and V is in the sloping uncials of cent.
   viii.--ix. Some use was made of V in the Roman edition of 1587, where
   it seems to have supplied the text of Maccabees; both codices were
   collated for Holmes and Parsons, who numbered V as a cursive.


    (B) Octateuch and Historical Books.

   (D) (T). CODEX COTTONIANUS. British Museum, Cotton MSS., Otho B. vi.
   5--6.

   A collection of fragments, the largest of which measures no more than 7
   x 5½ inches, containing portions of the Book of Genesis with vestiges
   of pictures executed in a semi-classical style.

   No other uncial codex of the LXX., of which any portion remains, has
   suffered so lamentable a fate. Brought to England from Philippi [360]
   in the reign of Henry VIII. by two Orthodox Bishops [361] , and
   presented to the English monarch, it remained in the Royal Library till
   the reign of Elizabeth, who gave it to her Greek tutor Sir John
   Fortescue, and from his hands after several vicissitudes it found its
   way into the Cotton collection. In 1731, while the codex was at
   Ashburnham House with the rest of that collection, it was reduced by
   fire to a heap of charred and shrivelled leaves. Even before the fire
   it had been imperfect [362] ; the beginning and end of the book had
   disappeared, and other leaves were defective here and there; yet 165 or
   166 leaves remained and 250 miniatures. The existing remains at the
   British Museum, though collected with the most scrupulous care, consist
   only of 150 mutilated fragments; to these must be added a smaller
   series preserved at the Baptist College, Bristol, to which institution
   they were bequeathed by Dr A. Gifford, formerly an Assistant Librarian
   at the Museum.

   Most of the London fragments were deciphered and published by
   Tischendorf in 1857 (Mon. sacr. ined., nov. coll. ii.); the rest,
   together with the Bristol fragments, are now accessible in Dr F. W.
   Gotch's Supplement to Tischendorf's Reliquiae cod. Cotton. (London,
   1881).

   Happily we have means of ascertaining with some approach to
   completeness the text of this codex as it existed before the fire.
   Although no transcript had been made, the MS. was more than once
   collated--by Patrick Young and Ussher for Walton's Polyglott, and
   afterwards by Gale, Crusius, and Grabe; and Grabe's collation, which is
   preserved in the Bodleian, was published by Dr H. Owen (Collatio cod.
   Cotton. Geneseos cum Editione Romana . . . , Londini, 1778). Some
   assistance can also be obtained from the Vetusta Monumenta published by
   the London Society of Antiquaries (vo1 i. 1747), where two plates are
   given depicting some of the miniatures, together with portions of the
   text of fragments which have since disappeared.

   Lastly, among the Peiresc papers in the Bibltothèque Nationale,
   transcripts have been found of Gen. i. 13, 14, xviii. 24--26, xliii.
   16, which were made from the MS. in 1606. They are printed in Mémoires
   de la Société Nationale des Antiquaires de France, liii. pp. 163--172
   [363] . As this discovery was overlooked when the second edition of The
   Old Testament in Greek, vol. i., passed through the press in 1895, it
   may be convenient to the student to have the new fragments placed
   before him in extenso.

   The vellum of the MS. is fine, but not so thin as in some other early
   uncials. The leaves were arranged in quires of four. Each page, where
   the writing was not broken by an illustration, contained from 26 to 28
   lines of 27 to 30 letters. The uncials are well formed, but vary to
   some extent in thickness and size. Initial letters are used, and the
   point is sometimes high, sometimes middle or low. On the whole the
   codex may probably be assigned to cent. v.--vi. The hands of three
   scribes have been traced in the fragments, and there appear to have
   been two correctors after the diorthotes; the earlier of the two, who
   seems to have lived in the eighth century, has retraced the faded
   letters.


   E. CODEX BODLEIANUS. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Auct. T. infr. ii. 1.


   The Bodleian volume contains the following fragments of Genesis: i.
   1--xiv. 6, xviii. 24 dikaion--xx. 14 kai apedoken, xxiv. 54
   ekpempsate--xlii. 18 eipen de au[tois]. Another leaf, now at the
   Cambridge University Library, contains xlii. 18 [au]tois te
   hemera--xliv. 13 ton hena kai, verso, to which xlii. 31--xliv. 13
   belongs, is written in (?) contemporary minuscules. It is now known
   that this text is carried on by more than one cursive MS. The St
   Petersburg cod. lxii. begins where the Cambridge fragment leaves off
   (at Gen. xliv. 13 Beniamin; ego men gar), and proceeds, with some
   lacunae, as far as 3 Regn. xvi. 28 ta loipa ton sumplokon). The largest
   of the lacunae (Jos. xxiv. 27--Ruth, inclusive) is supplied by the
   British Museum MS. Add. 20002, which once belonged to the same codex as
   E, the Cambridge fragment, and St Petersburg cod. lxii.

   The recent history of this MS. is both curious and instructive. The
   portions now at Oxford and London were brought from the East by
   Tischendorf in 1853; the Cambridge leaf and the St Petersburg portion
   followed in 1859. Tischendorf published the contents of the Bodleian
   volume in Monumenta sacra inedita, n. c. ii. (1857); the Cambridge leaf
   remained in his possession till his death in 1874, when it was
   purchased by the Syndics of the University Library. In 1891 it was
   recognised by the present writer and Mr H. A. Redpath as a continuation
   of the Bodleian Genesis [364] ; and its contents were at once
   communicated to the Academy (June 6, 1891), and were afterwards
   incorporated in the apparatus of the Cambridge manual LXX. (vol. i.,
   ed. 2, 1895). Finally, in 1898, Dr A. Rahlfs of Göttingen [365] proved
   that the Petersburg and London volumes originally formed a part of the
   codex to which the Oxford Genesis and the Cambridge leaf belonged. The
   entire MS. will be used for the apparatus of the larger Cambridge LXX.;
   a description by the Editors (Messrs Brooke and M^cLean) may be found
   in the Classical Review for May, 1899 (vo1. xiii., pp. 209--11).

   The Bodleian Genesis is written in large sloping uncials of a late form
   on 29 leaves of stout vellum; each page carries two columns of 37--44
   lines; in the earlier pages the letters are closely packed and there
   are sometimes as many as 28 in a line, but as the book advances the
   number seldom exceeds and sometimes fall below 20. Tischendorf was
   disposed to assign the writing to the 9th, or at the earliest the 8th
   century; but the debased character of the uncials, as well as the
   readiness of the scribe to pass from the uncial to the cursive script,
   point to a still later date [366] . According to the same authority the
   uncial leaves of the codex have passed through the hands of a nearly
   contemporary corrector, and also of another whose writing is more
   recent.


   F (VII). CODEX AMBROSIANUS. Ambrosian Library, Milan. A. 147 infr.


   The remains of this important Codex consist of the following fragments
   of the Octateuch: Gen. xxxi. 15 [allotri]ai--37 eraunesas, xlii. 14
   hoti kataskopoi--21 eisekousamen autou, 28 etarachthesan--xlvi. 6 ten

   adelphous autes, vii. 1 Zambri--ix. 27 tes semeron hem[eras], x. 37 en
   en aute--xii. 12 bas. Eglon [367] .

   An inscription on a blank page states that the fragments were "ex
   Macedonia Corcyram advecta, ibique Ill. Card. Fed. Borromaei
   Bibliothecae Ambrosianae Fundatoris iussu empta eidemque Bibliothecae
   transmissa sunt." They attracted the notice of Montfaucon (Diar. Ital.,
   p. 11, Pal. sacr. pp. 27, 186), and were collated for Holmes, but in an
   unsatisfactory manner. Ceriani's transcript (Mon. sacr. et prof. iii.,
   Mediol. 1864) supplies the text, for the accuracy of which the name of
   the Editor is a sufficient guarantee, and a learned preface, but the
   full prolegomena which were reserved for another volume have not
   appeared. A photograph is needed not only for palaeographical purposes,
   but to shew the marginal readings, many of which are Hexaplaric.

   The MS. is written on the finest and whitest vellum, the leaves of
   which are gathered in fours [368] ; three columns of writing stand on
   each page, and 35 lines in each column. The characters are those of
   cent. iv.--v.; initial letters are used, which project to half their
   breadth into the margin. Punctuation is frequent, and there is much
   variety in the use of the points; accents and breathings are freely
   added prima manu, a feature in which this MS. stands alone amongst
   early Uncials [369] . The colour of the ink changes after Deuteronomy,
   and the rest of the fragments seem to have been written by another
   scribe; but the work is contemporary, for the quire numbers have been
   added by the first scribe throughout. The MS. has passed through the
   hands of two early correctors, and the margins contain various
   readings, notes, and scholia.

   Voss. Gr. Q. 8. (2) Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, cod. Gr. 17,
   formerly Colbert. 3084. (3) St Petersburg, Imperial Library, v. 5.


   Of this codex Leyden possesses 130 leaves and Paris 22, while one leaf
   has strayed to St Petersburg. When brought together the surviving

   The Leyden leaves of this MS. are known to have been in the possession
   of Claude Sarràve, of Paris, who died in 1651. After his death they
   passed into the hands successively of Jacques Mentel, a Paris
   physician, who has left his name on the first page, and of Isaac Voss (
   1681), from whose heirs they were purchased by the University of
   Leyden. The Paris leaves had been separated from the rest of the MS.
   before the end of the 16tb century, for they were once in the library
   of Henri Memme, who died in 1596. With a large part of that collection
   they were presented to J. B. Colbert in 1732, and thus found their way
   into the Royal Library at Paris. Among earlier owners of the St
   Petersburg leaf were F. Pithaeus, Desmarez, Montfaucon [371] , and
   Dubrowsky. The text of the Leyden leaves and the St Petersburg leaf was
   printed in facsimile type by Tischendorf in the third volume of his
   Monumenta sacra (Leipzig, 1860); a splendid photographic reproduction
   of all the known leaves of the codex appeared at Leyden in 1897 [372] .

   The leaves measure 9? x 8? inches; the writing is in two columns of 27
   lines, each line being made up of 13--15 letters. In Tischendorf's
   judgement the hand belongs to the end of the fourth or the first years
   of the fifth century. There are no initial letters; the writing is
   continuous excepting where it is broken by a point or sign; points,
   single or double, occur but rarely; a breathing is occasionally added
   by the first hand, more frequently by an early corrector. Of the seven
   correctors noticed by Tischendorf three only need be mentioned
   here,--(A) a contemporary hand, (B) another fifth century hand which
   has revised Deuteronomy and Judges, and (C) a hand of the sixth century
   which has been busy in the text of Numbers.

   In one respect this codex holds an unique position among uncial MSS. of
   the Octateuch. It exhibits an Origenic text which retains many of the
   Hexaplaric signs. Besides the asterisk ( ) and various forms of the
   obelus ( , , , , and in the margin, --), the metobelus frequently
   occurs (:,  ·/,  /·,  ·/·). The importance of Cod. Sarravianus as a
   guide in the recovery of the Hexaplaric text has been recognised from
   the time of Montfaucon (comp. Field, Hexapla, i., p. 5); and it is a
   matter for no little congratulation that we now possess a complete and
   admirable photograph of the remains of this great MS.


   H. CODEX PETROPOLITANUS. In the Imperial Library at St Petersburg.


   This palimpsest consists at present of 88 leaves in octavo; in its
   original form there were 44 arranged in quaternions. Under the
   patristic matter which is now in possession of the vellum, Tischendorf
   detected a large part of the Septuagint text of Numbers. The fragments
   recovered contain chh. i. 1--30, 40--ii. 14, ii. 30--iii. 26, v.
   13--23, vi. 6--vii. 7, vii. 41--78, viii. 2--16, xi. 3--xiii. 11, xiii.
   28--xiv. 34, xv. 3--20, 22--28, 32--xvi. 31, xvi. 44--xviii. 4, xviii.
   15--26, xxi. 15--22, xxii. 30--41, xxiii. 12--27, xxvi. 54--xxvii. 15,
   xxviii. 7--xxix. 36, xxx. 9--xxxi. 48, xxxii. 7--xxxiv. 17, xxxvi.
   1--end of book. They are printed in Monumenta sacr. ined., nov. coll.
   i. (Leipzig, 1855).

   In Tischendorf's judgement the upper writing is not later than the
   ninth century; the lower writing he ascribes to the sixth; for though
   the characters are generally such as are found in fifth century MSS.,
   yet there are several indications of a later date, e.g. the numerous
   compendia scribendi and superscribed letters, and the occasional use of
   oblong forms. Chapters and arguments are noted in the margin--the
   chapters of Numbers are 207--and at the end of the book the number of
   stichi is specified (,gphla' = 3535); the scribe appends his name-- .


   K. FRAGMENTA LIPSIENSIA. Leipzig, University Library (cod. Tisch. ii.).


   Twenty-two leaves discovered by Tischendorf in 1844, of which seventeen
   contain under Arabic writing of the ninth century fragments of Numbers,
   Deuteronomy, Joshua, and Judges (Num. v. 17--18, 24--25; vii. 18--19,
   30--31, 35--36, 37--40, 42--43, 46--47; xv. 11--17, 19--24; xxvii.
   1--xxviii. 5, xxviii. 10--xxix. 2, xxxv. 19--22, 28--31. Deut. ii.
   8--10, 15--19, ix. 1--10, xviii. 21--xix. 1, xix. 6--9; xxi. 8--12,
   17--19. Jos. x. 39--xi. 16, xii. 2--15, xxii. 7--9, 10--23; Jud. xi.
   24--34, xviii. 2--20 [373] ).

   The Greek writing is not later than cent. vii. The fragments are
   printed in the first volume of Monumenta sacra inedita, n. c.


   L (VI). CODEX PURPUREUS VINDOBONENSIS. Vienna, Imperial Library.


   This MS. consists of 24 leaves of Genesis, with which are bound up two
   leaves of St Luke belonging to Codex N of the Gospels [374] .

   The Genesis leaves contain Gen. iii. 4--24, vii. 19--viii. 20, ix.
   8--15, 20--27; xiv. 17--20, xv. 1--5, xix. 12--26, 29--35; xxii.
   15--19, xxiv. 1--11, 15--20; xxiv. 22--31, xxv. 27--34, xxvi. 6--11,
   xxx. 30--37; xxxi. 25--34; xxxii. 1--18, 22--32; xxxv. 1--4, 8, 16--20,
   28--29, xxxvii. 1--19, xxxix. 9--18, xl 14--xli. 2, xli. 21--32, xlii.
   21--38, xliii. 2--21, xlviii. 16--xlix. 3, xlix. 28--33, l. 1--4.

   Like e great Cotton MS. the Vienna purple Genesis is an illustrated
   text, each page exhibiting a miniature painted in water-colours. The
   writing belongs to the fifth or sixth century; the provenance of the
   MS. is uncertain, but there are notes in the codex which shew that it
   was at one time in North Italy. Engravings of the miniatures with a
   description of the contents may be found in P. Lambecii Comm. de
   bibliotheca Vindobonensi, lib. iii. (ed. Kollar., 1776), and a
   transcript of the text in R. Holmes's Letter to Shute Barrington,
   Bishop of Durham (Oxford, 1795); but both these earlier authorities
   have been superseded by the splendid photographic edition lately
   published at Vienna (die Wiener Genesis herausgegeben von Wilhelm
   Ritter v. Hartel u. Franz Wickhoff, Wien, 1895).


   M (X). CODEX COISLINIANUS. Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Coisl. Gr. 1.


   A MS. of the Octateuch and the Historical Books, with lacunae; the 227
   remaining leaves contain Gen. i. 1--xxxiv. 2, xxxviii. 24--Num. xxix.
   23, xxxi. 4--Jos. x. 6, Jos. xxii. 34--Ruth iv. 19, 1 Regn. i. 1--iv.
   19, x. 19--xiv. 26, xxv. 33--3 Regn. viii. 40.

   This great codex was purchased in the East for M. Seguier, and brought
   to Paris about the middle of the seventeenth century. It was first
   described by Montfaucon, who devotes the first 31½ pages of his
   Bibliotheca Coisliniana to a careful description of the contents,
   dealing specially with the capitulation and the letters prefixed to the
   sentences. Facsimiles were given by Montfaucon, Bianchini (Evangelium
   quadruplex), Tischendorf (Monumenta sacr. ined., 1846), and Silvester,
   and a photograph of f. 125 r., containing Num. xxxv. 33--xxxvi. 13, may
   be seen in H. Omont's Facsimilés, planche vi. Montfaucon gives a
   partial collation of the codex with the Roman edition of the LXX., and
   a collation of the whole was made for Holmes; an edition is now being
   prepared by Mr H. S. Cronin.

   The leaves, which measure 13 x 9 inches, exhibit on each page two
   columns of 49 or 50 lines, each line containing 18--23 letters.
   According to Montfaucon, the codex was written in the sixth or at
   latest in the seventh century ("sexto vel cum tardissime septimo
   saeculo exaratus"), but the later date is now usually accepted. The
   margins contain a large number of notes prima manu [375] , among which
   are the excerpts from the N. T. printed by Tischendorf in the Monumenta
   and now quoted as cod. F^a of the Gospels [376] . The MS. is said by
   Montfaucon to agree frequently with the text of cod. A, and this is
   confirmed by Holmes as far as regards the Pentateuch. Lagarde (Genesis
   graece, p. 12) styles it Hexaplaric; hexaplaric signs and matter abound
   in the margins, and of these use has been made by Field so far as he
   was able to collect them from Montfaucon and from Griesbach's excerpts
   printed in Eichhorn's Repertorium.


   Z^a, d. FRAGMENTA TISCHENDORFIANA. Two of a series of fragments of
   various MSS. discovered by Tischendorf and printed in the first and
   second volumes of Monumenta sacra inedita, nov. coll. i. ii. (1855,
   1857).

   Z^a. Three palimpsest leaves containing fragments of 2--3 Regn. (2
   Regn. xxii. 38--42, 46--39; xxiii. 2--5, 8--10; 3 Regn. xiii. 4--6,
   8--11, 13--17, 20--23, xvi. 31--33, xvii. 1--5, 9--12, 14--17). The
   upper writing is Armenian, the lower an Egyptian-Greek hand of the 7th
   century, resembling that of cod. Q (v. infra).

   Z^d. Palimpsest fragment containing 3 Regn. viii. 58--ix. 1, also from
   the Nitrian MSS. There are two texts over the Greek of which the lower
   is Coptic, the upper Syriac; the Greek hand belongs to cent. v.

   Th. CODEX WASHINGTONIENSIS. See Additional Notes.


   II. FRAGMENTA TISCHENDORFIANA.

   Four leaves taken from the binding of Cod. Porfirianus Chiovensis (P of
   the Acts and Catholic Epistles [377] ), and published by Tischendorf in
   Mon. sacr. ined., nov. coll. vi. p. 339 ff. They yield an interesting
   text of portions of 4 Maccabees (viii. 6, 12, 15, 29; ix. 28--30,
   31--32). The writing appears to belong to cent. ix.


    (C) Poetical Books.


   I (13). CODEX BODLEIANUS. Oxford, Bodleian Library, Auct. D. 4. 1.


   A Psalter, including the Old Testament Canticles and a catena.
   Described by Bruns in Eichhorn's Repertorium, xiii. p. 177; cf.
   Lagarde's Genesis graece, p. 11, and Nov. Psalt. Gr. edit. Specimen, p.
   3. Parsons, who reckons it among the cursives, is content to say "de
   saeculo quo exaratus fuerit nihil dicitur"; according to Coxe
   (Catalogus codd. Biblioth. Bodl. i. 621), it belongs to the 9th
   century.


   R. CODEX VERONENSIS. Verona, Chapter Library.


   A MS. of the Psalter in Greek and Latin, both texts written in Roman
   characters. A few lacunae (Ps. i. 1--ii. 7, lxv. 20--lxviii. 3, lxviii.
   26--33, cv. 43--cvi. 2) have been supplied by a later hand, which has
   also added the psalmos idiographos (Ps. cli.). The Psalms are followed
   prima manu by eight canticles (Exod. xv. 1--21, Deut. xxxii. 1--44, 1
   Regn. ii. 1--10, Isa. v. 1--9, Jon. ii. 3--10, Hab. iii. 1--10,
   Magnificat, Dan. iii. 23 ff.).

   Printed by Bianchini in his Vindiciae canonicarum scripturarum, i.
   (Rome, 1740), and used by Lagarde in the apparatus of his Specimen and
   Psalterii Gr. quinquagena prima, and in the Cambridge manual Septuagint
   (1891). A new collation was made in 1892 by H. A. Redpath, which has
   been employed in the second edition of The 0. T. in Greek (1896); but
   it is much to be wished that the Verona Chapter may find it possible to
   have this important Psalter photographed.

   The codex consists of 405 leaves, measuring 10½ x 7½ inches; each page
   contains 26 lines. The Greek text appears at each opening on the
   left-hand page, and the Latin on the right.


   T (262). CODEX TURICENSIS. Zurich, Municipal Library.


   A purple MS. which contained originally 288 leaves; of these 223
   remain. The text now begins at xxvi. (xxvii.) 1, and there are lacunae
   in the body of the MS. which involve the loss of Pss. xxx. 2--xxxvi.
   20, xli. 6--xliii. 3, lviii. 24--lix. 3, lix. 9--10, 13--lx. 1, lxiv.
   12--lxxi. 4, xcii. 3--xciii. 7, xcvi. 12--xcvii. 8. The first five
   Canticles and a part of the sixth have also disappeared; those which
   remain are 1 Regn. ii. 6--10 (the rest of the sixth), the Magnificat,
   Isa. xxxviii. 10--20, the Prayer of Manasses [378] , Dan. iii. 23 ff.,
   Benedictus, Nunc Dimittis.

   Like Cod. R this MS. is of Western origin. It was intended for Western
   use, as appears from the renderings of the Latin (Gallican) version
   which have been copied into the margins by a contemporary hand, and
   also from the liturgical divisions of the Psalter. The archetype,
   however, was a Psalter written for use in the East--a fact which is
   revealed by the survival in the copy of occasional traces of the Greek
   staseis

   The characters are written in silver, gold, or vermilion, according as
   they belong to the body of the text, the headings and initial letters
   of the Psalms, or the marginal Latin readings. Tischendorf, who
   published the text in the fourth volume of his nova collectio (1869),
   ascribes the handwriting to the seventh century.

   The text of T agrees generally with that of cod. A, and still more
   closely with the hand in cod. ' known as '^c.a.


   U. FRAGMENTA LONDINENSIA. London, British Museum, pap. xxxvii.


   Thirty leaves of papyrus which contain Ps. x. (xi.) 2 [e]is
   pharetran--xviii. (xix.) 6, xx. (xxi.) 14 en tais dunasteiais
   sou--xxxiv. (xxxv.) 6 katadiok[o]n.

   These fragments of a papyrus Psalter were purchased in 1836 from a
   traveller who had bought them at Thebes in Egypt, where they had been
   found, it was said, among the ruins of a convent. Tischendorf assigned
   to them a high antiquity (Prolegg. ad V. T. Gr., p. ix., "quo nullus
   codicum sacrorum antiquior videtur"), and he was followed by Lagarde,
   who as late as 1887 described the London codex as "bibliorum omnium
   quos noverim antiquissimus" (Specimen, p. 4). But a wider acquaintance
   with the palaeography of papyri has corrected their estimate, and the
   fragments are now ascribed by experts to cent. vi.--vii. [379]

   The writing slopes, and the characters are irregularly formed; the
   scribe uses breathings and accents freely; on the other hand he writes
   continuously, not even breaking off at the end of a Psalm or
   distinguishing the title from the rest of the text. The hand is not
   that of a learned scribe or of the literary type [380] .

   It has been pointed out that the text of U corresponds closely with
   that of the Sahidic Psalter published by Dr Budge [381] .


   X (258). CODEX VATICANUS IOBI. Rome, Vatican Library, Gr. 749.


   A MS. of Job with occasional lacunae; the remaining portions are i.
   1--xvii. 13, xvii. 17--xxx. 9, xxx. 23--xxxi. 5, xxxi. 24--xxxiv. 35.
   There are miniatures, and a catena in an uncial hand surrounding the
   text. At the beginning of the book Hexaplaric scholia are frequent
   [382] .

   The text is written in a hand of the ninth century. It was used by
   Parsons, and its Hexaplaric materials are borrowed by Field [383] .


   W (43) CODEX PARISIENSIS. Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Gr. 20.


   A portion of an uncial Psalter containing in 40 leaves Ps. xci.
   14--cxxxvi. 1, with lacunae extending from Ps. cx. 7 to cxii. 10, and
   from Ps. cxvii. 16--cxxvi. 4. So Omont (Inventaire sommaire des mss.
   grecs, p. 4); according to Parsons (Praef. ad libr. Pss.), followed
   generally by Lagarde (Genesis gr. 15), the omissions are Ps. c. 4--ci.
   7, cx. 6--cxi. 10, cxvii. 16--cxviii. 4, cxviii. 176--cxxvi. 4.

   The codex was written by a hand of the ninth or tenth century, and
   contains paintings which, as Parsons had been informed, are of some
   merit.


   Z^c. See above under (B), p. 140.


   Fragments of the fourth or fifth cent. (Tisch.), containing Pss. cxli.
   (cxlii.) 7--8, cxlii. (cxliii.) 1--3, cxliv. (cxlv.) 7--13.

    (D) Prophets.

   O (VIII). FRAGMENTA DUBLINENSIA. Dublin, Trinity College Library, K. 3.
   4.


   Eight palimpsest leaves--in the original MS. folded as four--which are
   now bound up with Codex Z of the Gospels [384] and yield Isa. xxx.
   2--xxxi. 7, xxxvi. 19--xxxviii. 2.

   The original leaves of the Codex measured about 12x9 inches, and each
   contained 36 lines of 14--17 letters. The writing, which belongs to the
   early part of the sixth century, appears to be that of an Egyptian
   scribe, and Ceriani is disposed to connect the text of the fragments
   with the Hesychian recension [385] . They have been printed in
   facsimile type by Professor T. K. Abbott (Par palimpsestorum
   Dublinensium, Dublin, 1880), and are used in the apparatus of the
   Cambridge manual Septuagint.


   Q (XII). CODEX MARCHALIANUS. Rome, Vatican Library, Gr. 2125.


   A magnificent codex of the Prophets, complete, and in the order of cod.
   B (Hosea, Amos, Micah, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
   Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; Isaiah, Jeremiah with Baruch,
   Lamentations, Epistle, Ezekiel, Daniel (Theod.) with Susanna and Bel).

   This MS. was written in Egypt not later than the sixth century. It
   seems to have remained there till the ninth, since the uncial
   corrections and annotations as well as the text exhibit letters of
   characteristically Egyptian form. From Egypt it was carried before the
   12th century to South Italy, and thence into France, where it became
   the property of the Abbey of St Denys near Paris, and afterwards of
   René Marchal, from whom it has acquired its name. From the library of
   R. Marchal it passed into the hands of Cardinal F. Rochefoucauld, who
   in turn presented it to the Jesuits of Clermont. Finally, in 1785 it
   was purchased for the Vatican, where it now reposes.

   The codex was used by J. Morinus, Wetstein and Montfaucon, collated for
   Parsons, and printed in part by Tischendorf in the ninth volume of his
   Nova Collectio (1870). Field followed Montfaucon in making large use of
   the Hexaplaric matter with which the margins of the MS. abound, but was
   compelled to depend on earlier collations and a partial transcript. The
   liberality of the Vatican has now placed within the reach of all O.T.
   students a magnificent heliotype of the entire MS., accompanied (in a
   separate volume) by a commentary from the pen of Ceriani (1890). This
   gift is only second in importance to that of the photograph of Codex B,
   completed in the same year.

   Codex Marchalianus at present consists of 416 leaves, but the first
   twelve contain patristic matter, and did not form a part of the
   original MS. The leaves measure 11? x 7 inches; the writing is in
   single columns of 29 1ines, each line containing 24--30 letters. The
   text of the Prophets belongs, according to Ceriani, to the Hesychian
   recension; but Hexaplaric signs have been freely added, and the margins
   supply copious extracts from Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, and the
   LXX. of the Hexapla. These marginal annotations were added by a hand
   not much later than that which wrote the text, and to the same hand are
   due the patristic texts already mentioned, and two important note [386]
   from which we learn the sources of the Hexaplaric matter in the
   margins. The result of its labours has been to render this codex a
   principal authority for the Hexapla in the Prophetic Books.


   Y. CODEX TAURINENSIS. Turin, Royal Library, cod. 9.


   This codex consists of 135 leaves in quarto, and contains the
   dodekapropheton. The MS. is difficult to read, and there are many
   lacunae. The text, written according to Stroth [387] in the ninth
   century, is surrounded by scholia, and prefaced by Theodoret's
   hupotheseis to the various books.

   The Turin MS. does not appear to have been used hitherto for any
   edition of the LXX., nor has any transcript or collation been published
   [388] .


   Z^b, c. See above, under (B), p. 140.


   Z^b. Palimpsest fragments of Isaiah (iii. 8--14, v. 2--14, xxix.
   11--23, xliv. 26--xlv. 5). As in Z^a, the upper writing is Armenian;
   the Greek hand belongs apparently to cent. viii.--ix.

   Z^c. Palimpsest fragment of Ezekiel (iv. 16--v. 4) found among the
   Nitrian leaves at the British Museum. The Greek hand resembles that of
   Z^a, and is probably contemporary with it.


   G. CODEX CRYPTOFERRATENSIS. Basilian Monastery of Grotta Ferrata, cod.
   E. b. vii.


   This volume consists partly of palimpsest leaves which once belonged to
   a great codex of the Prophets. A scribe of the 13th century has written
   over the Biblical text liturgical matter accompanied by musical
   notation. Some portions of the book are doubly palimpsest, having been
   used by an earlier scribe for a work of St John of Damascus. About 130
   leaves in the present liturgical codex were taken from the Biblical
   MS., and the Biblical text of 85 of these leaves has been transcribed
   and published (with many lacunae where the lower writing could not be
   deciphered) in Cozza-Luzi's Sacrorum bibliorum vetustissima fragmenta,
   vol. i (Rome 1867) and iii. (1877).

   The original codex seems to have contained 432 leaves gathered in
   quires of eight; and the leaves appear to have measured about 10¾ x 8¼
   inches. The writing, which is in sloping uncials of the eighth or ninth
   century, was arranged in double columns, and each column contained
   25--28 lines of 13--20 letters.

   It cannot be said that Cozza's transcript, much as Biblical students
   are indebted to him for it, satisfies our needs. Uncial codices of the
   Prophets are so few that we desiderate a photographic edition, or at
   least a fresh examination and more complete collation of this
   interesting palimpsest.


   D. FRAGMENTUM BODLEIANUM. Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Gr. bibl. d. 2
   (P).


   A fragment of Bel in the version of Theodotion (21 gunaikon--41
   Daniel). A vellum leaf brought from Egypt and purchased for the
   Bodleian in 1888.

   Written in an uncial hand of the fifth (?) century, partly over a
   portion of a homily in a hand perhaps a century earlier.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The following uncial fragments have not been used for any edition of
   the LXX., and remain for the present without a symbolical letter or
   number.

   transcription is given by J. R. Harris, Biblical Fragments, no. 15 (cf.
   Mrs Lewis's Studia Sin. i. p. 97 f.). Cent. iv.

   (3) Another Sinaitic fragment, containing Num. xxxii. 29, 30 (J. R.

   xii. 7--xv. 4; see Athenaeum, Sept. 8, 1894, and Kenyon, Palaeography
   of Greek Papyri, pp. 109, 131. Cent. iii.

   (7) Part of a Psalter on a Berlin papyrus, containing Ps. xl. 26--xli.
   4; see Blass in Z. f. ägypt. Sprache, 1881 (Kenyon, op. cit., p. 131).

   (8) Nine fragments of a MS. written in columns of about 25 lines, one
   on each page. The fragments give the text of Ps. ci. 3, 4, cii. 5--8,
   cv. 34--43, cvi. 17--34, cviii. 15--21, cxiii. 18--26, cxiv. 3--cxv. 2.
   J. R. Harris, op. cit., no. 4. Cent. iv.

   (9) A vellum MS. in the Royal Library at Berlin (MS. Gr. oct. 2),
   containing Ps. cxi.--cl., followed by the first four canticles and

   given by E. Klostermann, Analecta, pp. 34 ff.

   (11) Portion of a leaf of a papyrus book, written in large uncials of
   cent. vii.--viii., exhibiting Cant. i. 6--9. This scrap came from the
   Fayûm and is now in the Bodleian, where it is numbered MS. Gr. bibl. g.
   1 (P); see Grenfell, Greek papyri (Oxford, 1896), pp. 12 f.

   (12) Palimpsest fragments of Wisdom and Sirach (cent. vi.--vii.),
   carried by Tischendorf to St Petersburg and intended for publication in
   the 8th volume of his Monumenta, which never appeared. See Nestle,
   Urtext, p. 74.

   (13) Two palimpsest leaves of Sirach belonging to cod. 2 in the
   Patriarchal Library at Jerusalem: cf. Papadopulos, Ieros. Bibl., i. p.
   14: ta anaplerotika phulla 27 kai 56 eisi palimpsesta hon he archike
   graphe anekei eis ton e' aiona . . . to palaion de auton keimenon esti
   distelon, kai en phul. 56 diakrinetai he epigraphe   . The leaves
   contain Sir. prol. 1--i. 14, i. 29--iii. 11. Printed by J. R. Harris,
   op. cit., no. 5.

   (14) Part of a Papyrus book which seems to have contained the Minor
   Prophets. The discovery of this fragment was announced in 1892 by W. H.
   Hechler, who gave a facsimile of Zach. xii. 2, 3 ('Times,' Sept. 7,
   1892; Transactions of the Congress of Orientalists, 1892, ii., p. 331
   f.). Mr Hechler claimed for this papyrus an extravagantly early date,
   but the hand appears to belong to the seventh century; see Kenyon,
   Pa1aeography of papyri, p. 118. This MS., which contains Zech.
   iv.--xiv., Mal. i.--iv., is now the property of the University of
   Heidelberg [389] .

   (15) Two leaves of a small vellum book, from the Fayûm, now Bodl. MS.
   Gr. bibl. e. 4 (P); the handwriting, "in small, fine uncials," yields
   the text of Zach. xii. 10--12, xiii. 3--5. "About the fifth century"
   (Grenfell, Greek papyri, p. 11 f).

   (16) A Rainer papyrus, assigned to the third century and containing
   Isa. xxxviii. 3--5, 13--16; see Nestle, Urtext, p. 74.

   (17) A portion of a leaf of a papyrus book, bearing the Greek text of
   Ezech. v. 12--vi. 3 (Bodl. MS. Gr. bibl. d. 4 (P)); see Grenfell, Greek
   papyri, pp. 9 ff. The text shews Hexaplaric signs; the writing is said
   to belong to the third century (Kenyon, Palaeography of papyri, p.
   107).

   (18) A fragment of a lead roll on which is engraved Ps. lxxix (lxxx).
   1--16, found at Rhodes in 1898. See Sitzungsberichte d. konigl. Preuss.
   Akad. d. Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1898 (xxxvii.) [390] .

    III. LECTIONARIES.

   From the second century the Greek-speaking Churches, following the
   example of the Hellenistic Synagogue, read the Greek Old Testament in
   their public assemblies.


   Justin, Apol. i. 67 ta sungrammata ton propheton anaginosketai. Const.
   ap. ii. 57 mesos de ho anagnostes eph' hupselou tinos hestos
   anaginosketo ta Moseos kai Iesou tou Naue, ta ton Kriton kai ton
   Basileion k.t.l. Ibid. viii. 5 meta ten anagnosin tou nomou kai ton
   propheton. Chrys. in Rom. xxiv. 3 ho maten entautha eiselthon, eipe tis
   prophetes, tis apostolos semeron dielechthe.


   At a later time the anagnoseis or anagnosmata were copied consecutively
   for ecclesiastical use. The lectionaries or fragments of lectionaries
   which survive, although frequently written in large and showy uncials
   [396] , are rarely earlier than the tenth or eleventh century; but a
   thorough investigation of their contents would doubtless be of
   interest, not only from a liturgical point of view, but for the light
   which it would throw on the ecclesiastical distribution of various
   types of text. Little has been done as yet in this direction, and our
   information, such as it is, relates chiefly to the N.T.


   See Matthaei, N. T. Gr., ad fin. vol. i.; Neale, Holy Eastern Church,
   General Intr., p. 369 ff.; Burgon, Last twelve verses of St Mark, p.
   191 ff.; Scudamore, art. Lectionary, D. C. A. ii.; Nitzsch, art.

   Faulhaber, Die Propheten-catenen nach röm. Handschriften (Freiburg i.
   B., 1899).


   The following list of MSS. [397] containing lections from the Old
   Testament has been drawn up from materials previously supplied by Dr E.
   Nestle. It will be seen that with few exceptions they are limited to
   those which are bound up with N.T. lections and have been catalogued
   under the head of N.T. lectionaries by Dr C. F. Gregory and
   Scrivener-Miller.

   The lists of MSS. given in this chapter must be regarded as tentative
   and incomplete. The student may supplement them to some extent by
   referring to recently published catalogues of MS. libraries, especially
   the following: V. Gardthausen, Catalogus codd. Graecorum Sinaiticorum
   (Oxford, 1886); Papadopulos Kerameus, Ierosolumitike Bibliotheke
   i.--iv. (St Petersburg, 1891--1899); Sp. P. Lambros, Catalogue of the
   Greek MSS. on Mount Athos (Cambridge, vol. i., 1895; vol. ii., with
   index, 1900). He may also consult with advantage J. B. Pitra, Analecta
   sacra, iii. (1883), p. 551 ff.; H. A. Redpath, in Academy, Oct. 22,

  CHAPTER VI.

    PRINTED TEXTS OF THE SEPTUAGINT.

   THE printed texts of the Septuagint fall naturally into two classes,
   viz. (1) those which contain or were intended to exhibit the whole of
   the Greek Old Testament; (2) those which are limited to a single book
   or to a group of books.


   I. COMPLETE EDITIONS.


   1. The first printed text of the whole Septuagint is that which forms
   the third column in the Old Testament of the great Complutensian
   Polyglott. This great Bible was printed at Alcalà (Complutum) in Spain
   under the auspices of Francisco Ximenes de Cisneros, Cardinal
   Archbishop of Toledo. Ximenes, who, in addition to his ecclesiastical
   offices, was Regent of Castile, began this undertaking in 1502 in
   honour of the birth of Charles V. (1500--1558), and lived to see the
   whole of the sheets pass through the press. He died Nov. 8, 1517, and
   the fourth volume, which completes the Old Testament and was the last
   to be printed, bears the date July 10, 1517. But the publication of the
   Polyglott was delayed for more than four years: the papal sanction
   attached to the N. T. volume is dated May 22, 1520, and the copy which
   was intended for the Pope seems not to have found its way into the
   Vatican Library until Dec. 5, 1521. The title of the complete work (6
   vols. folio) is as follows: "Biblia sacra Polyglotta complectentia V.T.
   Hebraico Graeco et Latino idiomate, N.T. Graecum et Latinum, et
   vocabularium Hebraicum et Chaldaicum V.T. cum grammatica Hebraica
   necnon Dictionario Graeco. Studio opera et impensis Cardinalis Fr.
   Ximenes de Cisneros. Industria Arnoldi Gulielmi de Brocario artis
   impressorie magistri. Compluti, 1514[--15, --17]."

   The O.T. volumes of the Complutensian Bible contain in three columns
   (1) the Hebrew text, with the Targum of Onkelos at the foot of the
   page, (2) the Latin Vulgate, (3) the Septuagint, with an interlinear
   Latin version--an order which is explained by the editors as intended
   to give the place of honour to the authorised version of the Western
   Church [399] . The prejudice which their words reveal does not augur
   well for the character of the Complutensian LXX. Nevertheless we have
   the assurance of Ximenes that the greatest care was taken in the
   selection of the MSS. on which his texts were based [400] . Of his own
   MSS. few remain, and among those which are preserved at Madrid there
   are only two which contain portions of the Greek Old Testament
   (Judges--Macc., and a Psalter). But he speaks of Greek MSS. of both
   Testaments which had been sent to him by the Pope from the Vatican
   Library [401] , and it has been shewn that at least two MSS. now in
   that Library (cod. Vat. gr. 330 = H.P. 108, and cod. Vat. gr. 346 =
   H.P. 248) were used in the construction of the Complutensian text of
   the LXX. [402] There is reason to suppose that a Venice MS. (S. Marc. 5
   = H.P. 68) was also employed; a copy of this MS. still exists at
   Madrid.

   The editors of the Complutensian Polyglott were the Spaniard Antonio de
   Nebrija, Professor of Rhetoric at Alcalà, and his pupil Ferdinando
   Nunez de Guzman (Pincianus); Diego Lopez de Zuñiga (Stunica); Juan de
   Vergara, Professor of Philosophy at Alcalà; a Greek from Crete, by name
   Demetrius; and three converts from Judaism, to whom the Hebrew text and
   the Targum were entrusted. The editing of the Greek LXX. text seems to
   have been left chiefly in the hands of Pincianus, Stunica and
   Demetrius.


   The Complutensian text is followed on the whole in the Septuagint
   columns of the four great Polyglotts edited by Arias Montanus, Antwerp,
   1569--72; B. C. Bertram, Heidelberg, 1586--7, 1599, 1616; D. Wolder,
   Hamburg, 1596; Michael Le Jay, Paris, 1645.


   2. In February 15 , after the printing of the Complutensian Polyglott
   but before its publication, Andreas Asolanus [403] , father-in-law of
   the elder Aldus, issued from the Aldine press a complete edition of the
   Greek Bible bearing the title: Panta ta kat' exochen kaloumena biblia,
   theias delade graphes palaias te kai neas. Sacrae scripturae veteris
   novaeque omnia. Colophon: Venetiis in aedib[us] Aldi et Andreae soceri.
   mdxviii., mense Februario.

   Like Ximenes, Andreas made it his business to examine the best MSS.
   within his reach. In the dedication he writes: "ego multis
   vetustissimis exemplaribus collatis biblia (ut vulgo appellant) graece
   cuncta descripsi." His words, however, do not suggest an extended
   search for MSS., such as was instituted by the Spanish Cardinal; and it
   is probable enough that he was content to use Bessarion's collection of
   codices, which is still preserved in St Mark's Library at Venice [404]
   . Traces have been found in his text of three at least of those MSS.
   (cod. ii = H.P. 29; cod. iii = H.P. 121; cod. v = H.P. 68).


   The Aldine text of the LXX. was followed on the whole in the editions
   of (1) Joh. Lonicerus, Strassburg, 1524, 1526; (2)? with a preface by
   Philip Melanchthon, Basle, 1545; (3) H. Guntius, Basle, 1550, 1582; (4)
   Draconites, in Biblia Pentapla, Wittenburg, 1562--5; (5) Francis du Jon
   (Fr. Junius) or (?) Fr. Sylburg, Frankfort, 1597; (6) Nic. Glykas,
   Venice, 1687.


   3. In 1587 a third great edition of the Greek Old Testament was;
   published at Rome under the auspices of Sixtus V. (editio Sixtina,
   Romana). It bears the title: E PALAIA DIAThEKE | KATA TOUS EBDOMEKONTA
   | DI AUThENTIAS | XUSTOU E' AKROU ARChIEREOS | EKDOThEISA | VETVS
   TESTAMENTVM | IVXTA SEPTVAGINTA | EX AUCTORITATE | SIXTI V. PONT. MAX.
   | EDITVM | ROMAE | EX TYPOGRAPHIA FRANCISCI ZANETTI. M.D.LXXXVI(I)
   [405] | CVM PRIVILEGIO GEORGIO FERRARIO CONCESSO..

   The volume consists of 783 pages of text, followed by a page of addenda
   and corrigenda, and preceded by three (unnumbered) leaves which contain
   (1) a dedicatory letter addressed to Sixtus V. by Cardinal Antonio
   Carafa, (2) a preface to the reader [406] , and (3) the papal
   authorisation of the book. These documents are so important for the
   history of the printed text that they must be given in full.


   (1) SIXTO QUINTO PONTIF. MAX. ANTONIUS CARAFA

   CARDINALIS SANCTAE SEDIS APOSTOLICAE BIBLIOTHECARIUS


   Annus agitur iam fere octavus ex quo Sanctitas vestra pro singulari suo
   de sacris litteris benemerendi studio auctor fuit beatae memoriae
   Gregorio XIII. Pont. Max. ut sacrosancta Septuaginta Interpretum
   Biblia, quibus Ecclesia tum Graeca tum Latina iam inde ab Apostolorum
   temporibus usa est, ad fidem probatissimorum codicum emendarentur. Quod
   enim Sanctitas V. pro accurata sua in perlegendis divinis scripturis
   diligentia animadvertisset, infinitos pene locos ex its non eodem modo
   ab antiquis sacris scriptoribus afferri quo in vulgatis Bibliorum
   Graecis editionibus ctrcumferrentur, existimassetque non aliunde eam
   lectionum varietatem quam a multiplici eaque confusa veterum
   interpretatione fluxisse; rectissime censuit ad optimae notae
   exemplaria provocandum esse, ex quibus, quoad fieri posset, ea quae
   vera et sincera esset Septuaginta Interpretum scriptura eliceretur. Ex
   quo fit ut vestram non solum pietatem sed etiam sapientiam magnopere
   admirer; cum videam S. V. de Graecis Bibliis expoliendis idem multos
   post annos in mentem venisse quod sanctos illos Patres Tridenti
   congregatos auctoritate ac reverentia ductos verae ac purae Septuaginta
   interpretationis olim cogitasse cognovi ex actis eius Concilii nondum
   pervulgatis. Huius autem expolitionis constituendae munus cum mihi
   demandatum esset a Gregorio XIII., cuius cogitationes eo maxime
   spectabant ut Christiana Religio quam latissime propagaretur, operam
   dedi ut in celebrioribus Italiae bibliothecis optima quaeque exemplaria
   perquirerentur atque ex iis lectionum varietates descriptae ad me
   mitterentur [407] . Quibus sane doctorum hominum quos ad id delegeram
   industria et iudicio clarae memoriae Gulielmi Cardinalis Sirleti (quem
   propter excellentem doctrinam et multiplicem linguarum peritiam in
   locis obscurioribus mihi consulendum proposueram) persaepe examinatis
   et cum vestro Vaticanae bibliothecae (cui me benignitas vestra nuper
   praefecit) exemplari diligenter collatis; intelleximus cum ex ipsa
   collatione tum a sacrorum veterum scriptorum consensione, Vaticanum
   codicem non solum vetustate verum etiam bonitate caeteris anteire;
   quodque caput est, ad ipsam quam quaerebamus Septuaginta
   interpretationem, si non toto libro, maiori certe ex parte, quam
   proxime accedere. Quod mihi cum multis aliis argumentis constaret, vel
   ipso etiam libri titulo, qui est kata tous hebdomekonta, curavi de
   consilio et sententia eorum quos supra nominavi, huius libri editionem
   ad Vaticanum exemplar emendandam; vel potius exemplar ipsum, quod eius
   valde probaretur auctoritas, de verbo ad verbum repraesentandum,
   accurate prius sicubi opus fuit recognitum et notationibus etiam
   auctum. Factum est autem providentia sane divina, ut quod Sanctitate
   vestra suadente sui Cardinalatus tempore inchoatum est, id variis de
   causis aliquoties intermissum per ipsa fere initia Pontificatus sui
   fuerit absolutum; scilicet ut hoc praeclarum opus, vestro Sanctissimo
   nomini dicatum, quasi monumentum quoddam perpetuum esset futurum apud
   omnes bonos et vestrae erga Rempublicam Christianam voluntatis et meae
   erga Sanctitatem vestram observantiae.


   (2) PRAEFATIO AD LECTOREM


   Qui sunt in sacrosanctis scripturis accuratius versati, fatentur omnes
   Graecam Septuaginta Interpretum editionem longe aliis omnibus quibus
   Graeci usi sunt et antiquiorem esse et probatiorem. Constat enim eos
   Interpretes, natione quidem Iudaeos, doctos vero Graece, trecentis uno
   plus annis ante Christi adventum, cum in Aegypto regnaret Ptolemaeus
   Philadelphus, Spiritu sancto plenos sacra Biblia interpretatos esse,
   eamque interpretationem a primis Ecclesiae nascentis temporibus tum
   publice in Ecclesiis ad legendum propositam fuisse, tum privatim
   receptam et explanatam ab Ecclesiasticis scriptoribus qui vixerunt ante
   B. Hieronymum, Latinae vulgatae editionis auctorem. Nam Aquila quidem
   Sinopensis, qui secundus post Septuaginta eosdem libros ex Hebraeo in
   Graecum convertit et multo post tempore sub Hadriano principe floruit,
   et eius interpretatio, (quod ea quae de Christo in scripturis praedicta
   fuerant, ut a Iudaeis gratiam iniret aliter quam Septuaginta vertendo,
   subdola obscuritate involverit) iamdiu est cum a recte sentientibus,
   licet in hexaplis haberetur, aliquibus locis non est probata. Hunc vero
   qui subsequuti sunt, Symmachus et Theodotio, alter Samaritanus sub L.
   Vero, alter Ephesius sub Imp. Commodo, uterque (quamvis et ipsi in
   hexaplis circumferrentur) parum fidus interpres habitus est: Symmachus,
   quod Samaritanis offensus, ut placeret Iudaeis, non unum sanctae
   scripturae locum perturbato sensu corruperit; Theodotio, quod Marcionis
   haeretici sectator nonnullis locis perverterit potius quam converterit
   sacros libros. Fuerunt praeter has apud Graecos aliae duae editiones
   incertae auctoritatis: altera Antonio Caracalla Imp. apud Hierichuntem,
   altera apud Nicopolim sub Alexandro Severo in doliis repertae. quae
   quod in octaplis inter Graecas editiones quintum et sextum locum
   obtinerent, quintae et sextae editionis nomen retinuerunt. Sed nec hae
   satis fidae interpretationes habitae sunt. His additur alia quaedam
   editio sancti Luciani martyris, qui vixit sub Diocletiano et Maximiano
   Impp., valde illa quidem probata, sed quae cum Septuaginta
   Interpretibus comparari nullo modo possit, vel ipsis etiam Graecis
   scriptoribus testantibus et Niceta confirmante his plane verbis in
   commentario Psalmorum: hemeis de kai ten toiauten ekdosin sebazomenoi,
   te ton hebdomekonta proskeimetha malista, hoti dieremenos ten tes
   dialektou metabolen poiesamenoi mian en hekastois ennoian kai lexin
   apodedokasin.

   Adeo Septuaginta Interpretum editio magni nominis apud omnes fuit;
   nimirum quae instinctu quodam divinitatis elaborata bono generis humani
   prodierit in lucem. Sed haec etiam ipsa, quod in hexaplis ita primum ab
   Origene collocata fuerit ut eius e regione aliae editiones quo inter se
   comparari commodius possent ad legendum propositae essent, deinde vero
   varietates tantum ex iis ad illam sub obelis et asteriscis notari
   essent coeptae, factum est ut vetustate notis obliteratis insincera
   nimis et valde sui dissimilis ad nos pervenerit: quippe quae insertis
   ubique aliorum interpretationibus, aliquibus autem locis duldici atque
   etiam triplici eiusdem sententiae interpretatione intrusa, male
   praeterea a librariis accepta, suum ob id nitorem integritatemque
   amiserit. Hinc illae lectionum penitus inter se dissidentes varietates
   et, quod doctissimorum hominum ingenia mentesque diu torsit, ipsae
   exemplarium non solum inter se sed a veteribus etiam scriptoribus
   dissensiones. Quod malum primo a multis ignoratum, ab aliis postea
   neglectum, quotidie longius serpens, principem librum, et a quo tota
   lex divina et Christiana pendent instituta, non levibus maculis
   inquinavit. Quo nomine dici non potest quantum omnes boni debeant Sixto
   V. Pont. Max. Is enim quod in sacris litteris, unde sanctissimam hausit
   doctrinam, aetatem fere totam contriverit, quodque in hoc libro cum
   veterum scriptis conferendo singularem quandam diligentiam adhibuerit,
   vidit primus qua ratione huic malo medendum esset; nec vidit solum, sed
   auctoritate etiam sua effecit ut summus Pontifex Gregorius XIII. Graeca
   Septuaginta Interpretum Biblia, adhibita diligenti castigatione, in
   pristinum splendorem restituenda curaret. Quam rem exequendam cum ille
   demandasset Antonio Carafae Cardinali, viro veteris sanctitatis et
   omnium honestarum artium cultori, nulla is interposita mora delectum
   habuit doctissimorum hominum qui domi suae statis diebus exemplaria
   manuscripta, quae permulta undique conquisierat, conferrent et ex iis
   optimas quasque lectiones elicerent; quibus deinde cum codice Vaticanae
   biliothecae saepe ac diligenter comparatis intellectum est, eum codicem
   omnium qui extant longe optimum esse, ac operae pretium fore si ad eius
   fidem nova haec editio pararetur.

   Sed emendationis consilio iam explicato, ipso quoque ratio quae in
   emendando adhibita est nunc erit apertenda, in primisque Vaticanus
   liber describendus, ad cuius praescriptum haec editio expolita est.
   Codex is, quantum ex forma characterum coniici potest, cum sit
   maioribus litteris quas vere antiquas vocant exaratus, ante millesimum
   ducentesimum annum, hoc est ante tempora B. Hieronymi et non infra,
   scriptus videtur. Ex omnibus autem libris qui in manibus fuerunt unus
   hic prae aliis, quia ex editione Septuaginta si non toto libro certe
   maiorem partem constare vises est, mirum in modum institutam
   emendationem adiuvit; post eum vero alii duo qui ad eius vetustatem
   proximi quidem sed longe proximi intervallo accedunt, unus Venetus ex
   bibliotheca Bessarionis Cardinalis, et is quoque grandioribus litteris
   scriptus; alter qui ex Magna Graecia advectus nunc est Carafae
   Cardinalis: qui liber cum Vaticano codice ita in omnibus consentit ut
   credi possit ex eodem archetypo descriptus esse. Praeter hos magno
   etiam usui fuerunt libri ex Medicea bibliotheca Florentiae collati, qui
   Vaticanas lectiones multis locis aut confirmarunt aut illustrarunt. Sed
   libri Vaticani bonitas non tam ex horum codicum miro consensu perspecta
   est, quam ex iis locis qui partim adducuntur partim explicantur ab
   antiquis sacris scriptoribus; qui fere nusquam huius exemplaris
   lectiones non exhibent ac reponunt, nisi ubi aliorum Interpretum locum
   aliquem afferunt, non Septuaginta. quorum editio cum esset nova
   emendatione perpolienda, recte ad huius libri normam, qui longe omnium
   antiquissimus, solus iuxta Septuaginta inscribitur, perpolita est; vel
   potius rectissime liber ipse ad litteram, quoad fieri potuit per
   antiquam orthographiam aut per librarii lapsus, est expressus. Nam
   vetus illa et iam absoleta eius aetatis scriptura aliquibus locis
   repraesentata non est; cum tamen in aliis omnibus, nisi ubi manifestus
   apparebat librarii lapsus, ne latum quidem unguem, ut aiunt, ab huius
   libri auctoritate discessum sit, ne in iis quidem quae si minus mendo,
   certe suspicione mendi videbantur non carere. satius enim visum est
   locos vel aliquo modo suspectos (nec enim fieri potest ut in quantumvis
   expurgate exemplari non aliqua supersit macula) quemadmodum habentur in
   archetypo relinqui quam eos ex alicuius ingenio aut coniectura
   emendari: quod multa quae primo vel mendosa vel mutilata in hoc codice
   videbantur, ea postea cum aliis libris collata vera et sincera
   reperirentur. Nam in libris Prophetarum, qui maxime in hoc exemplari
   (uno excepto Daniele) puram Septuaginta editionem resipiunt, mirum quam
   multa non habeantur; quae tamen recte abesse et eorum Interpretum non
   esse, intellectum est tum ex commentariis veterum scriptorum Graecis et
   Latinis, tum ex libris manuscriptis in quibus illa addita sent sub
   asteriscis.

   Atque haec ratio in notationibus quoque servata est, in quibus cum
   multa sint ex commentariis Graecis petita quae in codicibus
   manuscriptis partim mutilata partim varie scripta aliquibus locis
   circumferuntur, ea non aliter atque in archetypis exemplaribus
   reperiuntur descripta sunt, quo uniuscuiusque arbitratu adiuvantibus
   libris restitui possint. Nec vero illud omittendum, quod item pertinet
   ad notationes; non omnia in its repraesentata esse quae aut ad
   confirmandas lectiones Vaticanas e scriptoribus vulgatis, aut ad
   explenda quae in Septuaginta non habentur, ex aliorum editionibus
   afferri potuissent, quod in communibus libris cum legantur, inde sibi
   unusquisque nullo negotio ea parare possit. Quae vero in libris
   manuscriptis reperta, vel ad indicandas antiquarum tum lectionum tum
   interpretationum varietates (sub scholii illas nomine, quod ipsarum
   incerta esset auctoritas, nonnunquam relatas) vel ad stabiliendam
   scripturam Vaticanam et eius obscuriores locos illustrandos pertinere
   visa sunt, ea certe non sunt praetermissa.

   Ordo autem librorum in Vaticano exemplari cum idem fere sit cum eo qui
   apud Graecos circumfertur, a vulgatis tamen editionibus variat in hoc
   quod primo habet duodecim Prophetas et hos ipsos aliter dispositos;
   deinde reliquos quattuor, quemadmodum vulgo editi sunt. Atque hunc
   ordinem verum esse intelligimus ex eo quod illum agnoscunt et probant
   veteres Ecclesiastici scriptores. Et cum toto exemplari nulla capitum
   divisio sit, (nam in nova editione consultum est legentium commoditati)
   in libro tamen quattuor Prophetarum distinctio quaedam apparet
   subobscura, illi paene similts quam describit sanctus Dorotheus martyr,
   qui vixit sub Magno Constantino.

   Maccabaeorum libri absunt ab hoc exemplari, atque item liber Genesis
   fere totus; nam longo aevo consumptis membranis mutilatus est ab initio
   libri usque ad caput XLVII. et liber item Psalmorum, qui a Psalmo CV.
   usque ad CXXXVIII. nimia vetustate mancus est. Sed haec ex aliorum
   codicum collatione emendata sunt.

   Quod si aliqua videbuntur in hac editione, ut ait B. Hieronymus, vel
   lacerata vel inversa, quod ea sub obelis et asteriscis ab Origene
   suppleta et distincta non sint; vel obscura et perturbata, quod cum
   Latina vulgata non consentiant, et in aliquibus aliis editionibus
   apertius et expressius habeantur; eris lector admonendus, non eo
   spectasse huius expolitionis industriam ut haec editio ex permixtis
   eorum qui supra nominati sunt interpretationibus (instar eius quam
   scribit B. Hieronymus a Graecis koinen, a nostris appellatam Communem)
   concinnata, Latinae: vulgatae editioni, hoc est Hebraeo, ad verbum
   respondeat; sed ut ad eam quam Septuaginta Interpretes Spiritus sancti
   auctoritatem sequuti ediderunt, quantum per veteres libros fieri
   potest, quam proxime accedat. Quam nunc novis emendationibus
   illustratam et aliorum Interpretum reliquiis quae supersunt auctam, non
   parum profuturam ad Latinae vulgatae intelligentiam, dubitabit nemo qui
   hanc cum illa accurate comparaverit.

   Quae si doctis viris et pie sentientibus, ut aequum est, probabuntur,
   reliquum erit ut Sixto V. Pont. Max. huius boni auctori gratias agant,
   et ab omnipotenti Deo publicis votis poscant, optimum Principem nobis
   florentem quam diutissime servet. qui cum omnes curas cogitationesque
   suas in amplificandam ornandamque Ecclesiae dignitatem contulerit,
   dubitandum non est quin Rep. Christiana optimis legibus et sanctissimis
   institutis per eum reformata, religione ac pietate, revocatis antiquis
   ritibus, in suum splendorem restituta, in hoc quoque publicam causam
   sit adiuturus ut sacri veteres libri, hominum incuria vel improbitate
   corrupti, pro sua eximia benignitate ab omni labe vindicati, quam
   emendatissimi pervulgentur.

   The reader will not fail to note the intelligent appreciation of the
   LXX., and the wide outlook over the history of the Greek versions which
   are implied by these documents [408] . They shew that the Vatican had
   already learnt the true value of the Alexandrian Old Testament and, as
   a consequence, had resolved to place in the hands of the scholars of
   Europe as pure a text as could be obtained of the version which was
   used by the ancient Church, and was now felt to be essential to a right
   understanding of the Fathers and of the Latin Vulgate. The inception of
   the work was due to Pope Sixtus himself, who had suggested it to his
   predecessor Gregory XIII. in 1578; but the execution was entrusted to
   Cardinal Antonio Carafa and a little band of Roman scholars including
   Cardinal Sirleto, Antonio Agelli, and Petrus Morinus. Search was made
   in the libraries of Italy as well as in the Vatican for MSS. of the
   LXX., but the result of these enquiries satisfied the editors of the
   superiority of the great Vatican Codex (B = cod. Vat. gr. 1209) over an
   other known codices, and it was accordingly taken as the basis of the
   new edition. Use was made, however, of other MSS., among which were a
   Venice MS. which has been identified with S. Marc. cod. gr. 1 (H. P.
   23, Lag. V); a MS. belonging to Carafa, possibly cod. Vat. gr. 1252 (H.
   P. 63 + 129, cf. Klostermann, p. 12 f., and Batiffol, Bulletin
   critique, 15 Mars 1889), and certain Laurentian MSS. of which
   collations are still preserved in the Vatican Library (Vat. gr. 1241,
   1242, 1244; see Batiffol, La Vaticane, p. 90 f.). From these and other
   sources the editors supplied the large lacunae of Cod. B [409] . But
   they did not limit themselves to the filling up of gaps or even to the
   correction of errors, as will appear from a comparison of the Sixtine
   text with the photographic representation of the Vatican MS. The
   edition of 1587 is not an exact reproduction of a single codex, even
   where the selected MS. was available; but it is based as a whole on a
   great uncial MS., and it is the first edition of the LXX. which
   possesses this character. Moreover, criticism has confirmed the
   judgement of the Roman editors in regard to the selection of their
   basal MS. It is a fortunate circumstance that the authority of the
   Vatican was given before the end of the sixteenth century to a text of
   the LXX. which is approximately pure.

   Besides the text the Roman edition contained considerable materials for
   the criticism of the Greek Old Testament, collected by the labours of
   Morinus, Agelli, Nobilius, and others. These include readings and
   scholia from MSS. of the LXX., renderings from Aquila and the other
   non-Septuagintal Greek versions, and a large assortment of patristic
   citations.


   Editions based upon the Sixtine are very numerous. The following list
   is abridged from Nestle's Urtext (p. 65 ff.):

   1. Jo. Morinus, Paris, 1628, 1641. 2. R. Daniel, London, 4to and 8vo,
   1653; Cambridge, 1653. 3. B. Walton, London, 1657 (the third column of
   his Polyglott). 4. Field, Cambridge, 1665 (with the praefatio
   paraenetica of J. Pearson [410] , Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity,
   afterwards Bp of Chester). 5. J. Leusden, Amsterdam, 1683. 6. Leipzig,
   1697 (with prolegomena by J. Frick). 7. L. Bos, Frankfort, 1709. 8. D.
   Mill, Amsterdam, 1725. g. C. Reineccius, Leipzig, 1730. 10. Halle,
   1759--62 (with a preface by J. G. Kirchner). 11. Holmes and Parsons,
   Oxford, 1798--1827. 12. Oxford, 1817 (with introduction by J. [G.]
   [411] Carpzow). 13. F. Valpy, London, 1819. 14. London, 1821, 26, 31,
   51, 69, 78 (the LXX. column of Bagster's Polyglott). 15. Venice, 1822.
   16. Glasgow and London, 1822, 31, 43. 17. L. Van Ess, Leipzig, 1824,
   35, 55, 68, 79, 87 (prolegomena and epilegomena separately in 1887).
   18. London, 1837. 19. Didot, Paris, 1839, 40, 48, 55, 78, 82. 20.
   Oxford, 1848, 75. 21. A. F. C. von Tischendorf, Leipzig, 1850, 56, 60,
   69, 75, 80, 87.

   Of the above some are derived from the Sixtine indirectly, whilst
   others present a Sixtine text more or less modified, or accompanied by
   variants from other MSS.


   4. The example of Rome was followed in the 18th century by England,
   which had meanwhile acquired an uncial Bible only less ancient, and in
   the view of some scholars textually more important than the great
   Vatican MS. The variants of Codex Alexandrinus had been given in
   Walton's Polyglott under the Sixtine text [412] , but the honour of
   producing an edition on the basis of the English codex belongs to a
   Prussian scholar, John Ernest Grabe, an adopted son of the University
   of Oxford. This edition appeared ultimately in four folio volumes
   (1707--20), but only the first and fourth had been published when Grabe
   died (1712); the second and third were undertaken after his decease by
   Francis Lee, M.D., and William Wigan, D.D. respectively. Vol. i. (1707)
   contains the Octateuch, Vol. ii. (1719) the Historical Books, Vol. iii.
   (1720) the Prophets, Vol. iv. (1709) the Poetical Books. The title to
   the first volume runs: "Septuaginta | interpretum | tomus I | continens
   Octateuchum | quem | ex antiquissimo codice Alexandrino | accurate
   descriptum | et ope aliorum exemplarium, ac priscorum scriptorum |
   praesertim vero Hexaplaris editionis Origenianae | emendatum atque
   suppletum | additis saepe asteriscorum et obelorum signis | summa cura
   edidit | Joannes Ernestus Grabe S.T.P. | Oxonii, a theatro Sheldoniano
   | . . . MDCCVII."

   This title sufficiently indicates the general principles upon which
   this great undertaking was based. Like the Sixtine edition, Grabe's is
   in the main a presentation of the text exhibited in a single uncial
   codex; like the Sixtine, but to a greater extent, its text is in fact
   eclectic and mixed. On the other hand the mixture in Grabe's
   Alexandrian text is overt and can be checked at every point. He deals
   with his codex as Origen dealt with the koine, marking with an obelus
   the words, clauses, or paragraphs in the MS. for which he found no
   equivalent in the Massoretic Hebrew, and placing an asterisk before
   such as he believed to have been derived from Theodotion or some other
   non-Septuagintal source. If he constantly adds to his MS. or relegates
   its readings to the margin, such additions and substituted words are
   distinguished from the text of cod. A by being printed in a smaller
   type. So far as it professes to reproduce the text of the MS., his
   edition is substantially accurate. The prolegomena by which each volume
   is introduced are full and serviceable; and the work as a whole,
   whatever may be thought of the method adopted by the editors, is
   creditable to the Biblical scholarship of the age.

   Grabe's text was reproduced by Breitinger (Zurich, 1730--2), and
   Reineccius (in his Biblia sacra quadrilinguia, Leipzig, 1750--1); also
   in a Greek Bible issued at Moscow in 1821 under the authority of the
   Holy Synod. A more important work based upon this edition is the
   Septuagint published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge
   under the care of Dr Field (Vetus Testamentum Graece iuxta LXX.
   interpretes. Recensionem Grabianam ad fidem codicis Alexandrini
   aliorumque denuo recognovit . . . F. Field, Oxonii, 1859). But the
   purpose which the Society had in view forbade a critical treatment of
   the materials, and whilst the learned editor has removed many of the
   imperfections of Grabe's work, the text remains arbitrary and mixed,
   and the arrangement is alien from that of all LXX. MSS. the
   non-canonical books being relegated to an appendix as apokrupha.

   5. Each of the four great editions of the Septuagint already described
   (the Complutensian, Aldine, Sixtine, and Grabian) endeavoured to supply
   a text approximately representing either a group of MSS., or a single
   uncial of high antiquity. No attempt had been made as yet to offer an
   exact reproduction of a codex, or to provide a full apparatus criticus,
   the purpose of the editors in each case being practical rather than
   critical. This want was met in some degree in certain of the secondary
   editions; thus the Basle reprint of the Aldine text (1545) gave a short
   list of variants and conjectural emendations; in the London Polyglott
   the readings of Codex Alexandrinus were printed underneath the Sixtine
   text, and those of Codex Sarravianus were exhibited in the Septuagint
   of Lambert Bos. But the first comprehensive effort in this direction
   was made by Robert Holmes (1748--1805), Professor of Poetry at Oxford,
   and Canon of Christ Church, and, from 1804, Dean of Winchester. The
   preparations for his great work were begun in 1788. An appeal was made
   to the liberality of public bodies and private patrons of learning, and
   the task of collating MSS. was committed to a large number of scholars
   at home and on the continent, whose names are honourably mentioned in
   the opening pages of the first volume. From 1789 to 1805 an annual
   account was printed of the progress of the work [413] , and the
   Bodleian Library contains 164 volumes of MS. collations (Holmes MSS.
   A.D. 1789--1805, nos. 16455--16617) [414] which were deposited there
   during those seventeen years. In 1795 a specimen of the forthcoming
   work was published together with a transcript of the Vienna Genesis in
   a letter to the Bishop of Durham (Shute Barrington). Genesis appeared
   separately in 1798, followed in the same year by the first volume
   bearing the title: Vetus Testamentum Graecum cum variis lectionibus.
   Edidit Robertus Holmes, S.T.P., R.S.S., Aedis Christi Canonicus. Tomus
   primus. Oxonii: e typographeo Clarendoniano. MDCCXCVIII. This volume,
   which contains the Pentateuch, with a preface and appendix, was the
   only one which Holmes lived to complete. He died Nov. 12, 1805, and two
   years later the editorship was entrusted to James Parsons [415] , under
   whose care the remaining volumes were issued (Vol. ii., Joshua--2
   Chronicles, 1810; Vol. iii., 2 Esdras--Canticles, 1823; Vol. iv.,
   Prophets, 1827; Vol. v., the non-canonical books, 1 Esdras--3
   Maccabees, 1827). At the end of Vol. v. there is a list of the Greek
   MSS. collated for the work. Three hundred and eleven are enumerated.
   (i.--xiii., 14--311); a corrected estimate gives a total of 297
   separate codices, of which 20 are uncial. Besides the readings of this
   large number of Greek MSS., the apparatus of Holmes and Parsons
   exhibits the evidence of the Old Latin versions so far as it had been
   collected by Sabatier, and of the Coptic (Memphitic and Sahidic),
   Arabic, Slavonic, Armenian and Georgian versions, obtained partly from
   MSS., partly from printed texts. Use was also made of patristic
   citations and of the four great editions of the Septuagint, the Sixtine
   supplying the text, while the Aldine, Complutensian and Alexandrine
   (Grabian) are cited in the notes. In addition to these, Holmes employed
   the printed text of the catena of Nicephorus (Leipzig, 1772--3), and J.
   F. Fischer's edition of cod. Lips. 361 (Leipzig, 1767--8) [416] .

   The great work of Holmes and Parsons has been severely criticised by
   later scholars, especially by Hatch [417] and Lagarde [418] . A
   vigorous defence of the Oxford editors will be found in a recent
   article in the Church Quarterly Review (already quoted). It appears to
   be certain that every effort was made by Holmes to secure the services
   of the best scholars who were available for the work of collation.

   Among the collators of Greek MSS. employed by the Oxford editors were
   Bandini (Florence), C. F. Matthäi (Moscow), F. C. Alter (Vienna),
   Schnurrer (Tübingen), Moldenhawer (Copenhagen). "The Armenian Version
   was chiefly collated by Hermannus Breden-Kemp (1793) and F. C. Alter
   (1795--1804), the latter also taking the Georgian . . the Slavonic . .
   Coptic . . and Bohemian Versions. The Arabic Versions were undertaken
   by Paulus and Prof. Ford, and the Syriac quotations in the Horreum
   mysteriorum of Gregorius Bar-Hebraeus . . by Dr Holmes" (F. C. Madan,
   Summary catalogue, p. 640).

   But in so vast an accumulation of the labours of many workers it was
   impossible to maintain an uniform standard of merit; nor are the
   methods adopted by Holmes and his continuator altogether such as would
   commend themselves at the present day. The work is an almost unequalled
   monument of industry and learning, and will perhaps never be superseded
   as a storehouse of materials; but it left abundant room for
   investigations conducted on other lines and among materials which were
   not accessible to Holmes and his associates.

   6. The next step was taken by A. F. C. von Tischendorf (1815--1874),
   who in the midst of his researches in Eastern libraries and his work
   upon the text of the New Testament found leisure to project and carry
   through four editions (1850, 1856, 1860, 1869) a manual text of the
   Septuagint. Its plan was simple, but suggestive. His text was a revised
   Sixtine; underneath it he placed an apparatus limited to the variants
   of a few great uncials: "eam viam ingressus sum (he writes [419] ) ut
   textum per tria fere secula probatissimum repeterem, mutatis tantummodo
   quibus mutatione maxime opus esset, addita vero plena lectionis
   varietate ex tribus codicibus antiquissimis quos fere solos utpote
   editos confidenter adhibere licebat." The three MSS. employed by
   Tischendorf in his first edition (1850) were A (from Baber's
   facsimile), C (from his own facsimile), and FA, the portion of Cod.
   Sinaiticus which was published in 1846; in the third and fourth
   editions he was able to make further use of Cod. Sinaiticus, and to
   take into account Mai's edition of Cod. B.

   Since Tischendorf's death three more editions of his Septuagint have
   appeared--a fifth in 1875, a sixth and a seventh in 1880 and 1887
   respectively, the last two under the supervision of Dr Eberhard Nestle.
   Nestle added a Supplementum editionum quae Sixtinam sequuntur omnium in
   primis Tischendorfianarum, consisting of a collation of the Vatican and
   Sinaitic MSS. with the Sixtine text, the Vatican text being obtained
   from Vercellone and Cozza's facsimile, and the Sinaitic from
   Tischendorf's edition of '; an appendix contained a collation of Daniel
   (LXX.) from Cozza's edition of the Chigi MS. The Supplementum was
   reissued in 1887 with various enrichments, of which the most important
   was a collation of cod. A from the London photograph which appeared in
   1882--3. With these helps the reader of Tischendorf's Septuagint is
   able to correct and supplement the apparatus, and to compare the text
   with that of cod. B so far as it could be ascertained before the
   publication of the photograph.

   7. Another of the great Biblical scholars of the nineteenth century,
   Paul de Lagarde, commenced an edition of the Greek Old Testament, which
   was intended to be a definite step towards the reconstruction of the
   text. Lagarde's general plan was announced in Symmicta ii. (1880), p.
   137 ff., and in a modified and simpler form by a pamphlet published two
   years later (Ankündigung einer neuen Ausgabe der griechischen
   übersetzung des A.T., Göttingen, 1882). A beginning was made by the
   appearance of the first half of the text of the Lucianic recension
   (Librorum V.T. canonicorum pars prior Graece Pauli de Lagarde studio et
   sumptibus edita, Göttingen, 1883). Lagarde's untimely death in 1891
   left this work incomplete, and though his papers are preserved at
   Göttingen, it is understood that no steps will be taken to carry out
   the scheme, at least on the same lines. The published volume contains
   the Octateuch and the Historical Books as far as Esther. Of the last
   named book two texts are given, with an apparatus, but with this
   exception the text stands alone, and the reader knows only that it is
   an attempted reconstruction of Lucian, based upon six MSS. which are
   denoted a f h m p z (H. P. 108, 82, 19, 93, 118, 44). This is not the
   place to discuss Lagarde's critical principles, but it may be mentioned
   here that his attempt to reconstruct the text of Lucian's recension was
   but one of a series of projected reconstructions through which he hoped
   ultimately to arrive at a pure text of the Alexandrian version. The
   conception was a magnificent one, worthy of the great scholar who
   originated it; but it was beset with practical difficulties, and there
   is reason to hope that the desired end may be attained by means less
   complicated and more direct.

   8. In the spring of 1883 the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press
   issued a notice that they had undertaken " [420] an edition of the
   Septuagint and Apocrypha with an ample apparatus criticus intended to
   provide material for a critical determination of the text," in which it
   was "proposed to give the variations of all the Greek uncial MSS., of
   select Greek cursive MSS., of the more important versions, and of the
   quotations made by Philo and the earlier and more important
   ecclesiastical writers." As a preliminary step they announced the
   preparation of "a portable text . . . taken from the Vatican MS., where
   this MS. is not defective, with the variations of two or three other
   early uncial MSS." The suggestion was originally due to Dr Scrivener,
   who submitted it to the Syndics of the Press in the year 1875, but was
   ultimately prevented by many preoccupations and failing health from
   carrying his project into execution. After undergoing various
   modifications it was committed in 1883 to the present writer,
   instructed by a committee consisting of Professors Westcott, Hort,
   Kirkpatrick, and Bensly; to Dr Hort in particular the editor was
   largely indebted for counsel in matters of detail. The first edition of
   the portable text was completed in 1894 (The Old Testament in Greek
   according to the Septuagint, vol. i., Genesis--4 Regn., 1887; vol. ii.,
   1 Chron.--Tobit, 1891; vo1 iii., Hosea--4 Macc., r89q); the second and
   third revised editions [421] followed (vol. i., 1895, 1901; vol. ii.,
   1896, 1907; vol. iii., 1899, 1905 [422] ). The larger Cambridge
   Septuagint has been entrusted to the joint editorship of Dr A. E.
   Brooke, Fellow of King's College, and Mr N. McLean, Fellow of Christ's
   College; and of the Octateuch, which will form the first volume,
   Genesis appeared in 1906, Exod., Lev. 1909, Numb., Deut. 1911. It
   reproduces the text of the manual Septuagint, but the apparatus
   embraces, according to the original purpose of the Syndics, the
   evidence of all the uncial MSS., and of a considerable number of
   cursives "selected after careful investigation with the view of
   representing the different types of text"; the Old Latin, Egyptian,
   Syro-Hexaplar, and Armenian versions are also represented, whilst use
   is made of the quotations in Josephus as well as those in Philo and the
   more important Christian fathers. Such an apparatus falls far short of
   that presented by Holmes and Parsons, in regard to the quantity of
   evidence amassed; but efforts are being made to secure a relatively
   high degree of accuracy, and the materials are selected and arranged in
   such a manner as to enable the reader to study the grouping of the MSS.
   and other authorities. Thus the work proceeds upon the principle
   formulated by Lagarde: "editionem Veteris Testamenti Graeci . . .
   collatis integris codicum familiis esse curandam, nam familiis non
   accedere auctoritatem e codicibus, sed codicibus e familiis [423] ."

   A word may be added with regard to the text which will be common to the
   manual and the larger edition of the Cambridge Septuagint. It is that
   of the great Vatican MS., with its lacunae supplied from the uncial MS.
   which occupies the next plane in point of age or importance. For a text
   formed in this way no more can be claimed than that it represents on
   the whole the oldest form of the Septuagint to be found in any one of
   our extant MSS. But it supplies at least an excellent standard of
   comparison, and until a critical text has been produced [424] , it may
   fairly be regarded as the most trustworthy presentation of the
   Septuagint version regarded as a whole.

  CHAPTER I.

    TITLES, GROUPING, NUMBER, AND ORDER OF THE BOOKS.

   THE Greek Old Testament, as known to us through the few codices which
   contain it as a whole, and from the lists which appear in the Biblical
   MSS. or in ancient ecclesiastical writings, differs from the Hebrew
   Bible in regard to the titles of the books which are common to both,
   and the principle upon which the books are grouped. The two collections
   differ yet more materially in the number of the books, the Greek Bible
   containing several entire writings of which there is no vestige in the
   Hebrew canon, besides large additions to the contents of more than one
   of the Hebrew books. These differences are of much interest to the
   Biblical student, since they express a tradition which, inherited by
   the Church from the Alexandrian synagogue, has widely influenced
   Christian opinion upon the extent of the Old Testament Canon, and the
   character and purpose of the several books.

   1. The following tables shew (A) the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin titles of
   the canonical books of the Old Testament; (B) the order and grouping of
   the books in (1) lists of Jewish origin, (2) the great uncial MSS. of
   the Greek Bible, (3) patristic and synodical lists of the (a) Eastern,
   (b) Western Church.

   2. We may now proceed to consider the chief points which these tables
   illustrate.

   (1) THE TITLES OF THE BOOKS. It will be seen that the Hebrew titles
   fall into three classes. They consist of either (1) the first word or
   words of the book (Genesis--Deuteronomy, Proverbs, Lamentations); or
   (2) the name of the hero or supposed author (Joshua, Judges, Samuel,
   Kings, Isaiah and the other Prophets, Job, Ruth, Esther, Daniel, Ezra);
   or (3) a description of the contents (Psalms, Song of Songs,
   Chronicles). Titles of the second and third class are generally
   reproduced in the Greek; there are some variations, as when Samuel and
   Kings become 'Kingdoms,' and 'Diaries' (dvyhytym) is changed into
   'Omissions' (Paraleipomena [442] ), but the system of nomenclature is
   the same. But titles of the first class disappear in the Greek, and in
   their place we find descriptive names, suggested in almost every case
   by words in the version itself. Thus Genesis appears to come from Gen.
   ii. 4 haute he biblos geneseos ouraoou kai ges, Exodus from Ex. xix. 1
   tes exodoth ton huion Israel ek ges Aiguptou, Numbers from Num. i. 2
   kata arithmon ex onomatos, Deuteronomy from Deut. xvii. 18 grapsei auto
   to deuteronomion touto eis biblion [443] , Ecclesiastes from Eccl. i. 1
   rhemata ekklhsiastou.

   The Greek titles are probably of Alexandrian origin and pre-Christian
   use. Not only were they familiar to Origen (Eus. H. E. vi. 25), but
   they are used in Melito's list, although it came from Palestine. Some
   of them at least appear to have been known to the writers of the New
   Testament; cf. Acts ii. 30 en biblo psalmon, xiii. 33 en to psakno to
   deutero, Rom. ix. 25 en to Hosee legei [444] . Philo [445] uses
   Genesis, Leuitikon or Leuitike biblos, Dethteronomion, Basileiai,
   Paroimiai, but his practice is not quite constant; e.g. he calls Exodus
   he Exagoge [446] ; Deuteronomy is sometimes he Epinomis, and Judges he
   ton K?imaton [447] biblos, Similar titles occur in the Mishna [448] ,
   whether suggested by the Alexandrian Greek, or independently coined by
   the Palestinian Jews; thus Genesis is spr ytsyrh, Numbers s msprym,
   Proverbs s chkmh, Lamentations qynvt.

   Through the Old Latin version the Greek titles passed into the Latin
   Bible [449] , and from the Latin Bible into the later versions of
   Western Christendom. In three instances, however, the influence of
   Jerome restored the Hebrew titles; 1, 2 Kingdoms have become 1, 2
   Samuel, and 3, 4 Kingdoms, 1, 2 Kings, whilst 'Chronicles,'
   representing the Hebrew dvryhymym, has taken the place of
   Paralipomenon.


   Cf Hieron. Prol. Gal.: "tertius sequitur Samuel, quem nos Regnorum
   primum et secundum dicimus; quartus Malachim, id est Regum, qui tertio
   et quarto Regnorum volumine continetur . . . septimus Dabre aiamim, id
   est 'Verba dierum,' quod significantius Chronicon totius divinae
   historiae possumus appellare."

   The Greek titles vary slightly in different codices and lists. Besides
   the variations of cod. A which appear in Table B (2), the following are
   mentioned in the apparatus of Holmes and Parsons. Joshua: Iesous ho
   Naue, ho tou Naue, Judges: Kritai tou Israel, hai ton kriton praxeis.
   Chronicles: Paraleipomenon ton basileion Iouda. Psalms: Dauid prophetou
   kai basileos melos. When Nehemiah is separated from Ezra its title is:
   ta peri Neemiou or logoi N. huiou Hachalia. A few further forms may be
   gleaned from the patristic lists. As an alternative for Paraleipomenon
   the Apostolic Canons give tou bibliou ton hemeron, while Ezra is known
   to Hilary as sermones dierum Esdrae. The Psalter is sometimes biblos
   Psalmon, liber Psalmorum, or Psalterion Dabitikon, Psalmi David regis,
   Psalterium Daviticum. For Asma asmaton we have occasionally asmata
   asmaton--a form rejected by Origen (ap. Eus. H.E. vi. 25 ou gar, hos
   hupolambanousi tines, Asmata asmaton), but used by Pseudo-Chrysostom
   and John of Damascus, and found in cod. A and in several of the Latin
   lists [450] ; cf. the English Article VI. "Cantica, or Songs of
   Solomon." The lesser Prophets are hoi dodeka or dekaduo, ton dodeka
   propheton mia biblos, to dodekapropheton, prophetae xii; the greater,
   hoi tessares, prophetae iv, prophetae iv maiorum voluminum, or simply
   maiores; when the two collections are merged into one they become hoi
   dekaex or hoi hekkaideka, to hekkaidekapropheton, prophetae xvi.


   (2) THE GROUPING OF THE BOOKS. The methods of grouping adopted in the
   Hebrew and Alexandrian Greek Bibles differ not less widely than the
   nomenclature of the books. The Hebrew canon is uniformly tripartite,
   and "the books belonging to one division are never (by the Jews)
   transferred to another [451] ." Its three groups are known as the Law
   (tvrh), the Prophets (nv'ym), and the Writings (ktvvym). The Massora
   recognised, however, certain subdivisions within the second and third
   groups; the Prophets were classed as Former (r'svnym), i.e. Joshua,
   Judges, Samuel, Kings; and Latter ('chrvnym), and among the 'Latter'
   the Twelve minor Prophets formed a single collection [452] . Similarly
   'the five Rolls' (mglvt), i.e. Ruth, Canticles, Ecclesiastes,
   Lamentations, Esther, made a subsection among the Kethubim. The
   tripartite division of the canon was known at Alexandria in the second
   century B.C., for the writer of the prologue to Sirach refers to it
   more than once (1 f. tou nomou kai ton propheton kai ton allon ton kat'
   autous ekolouthekoton: 6 f. tou nomou kai ton propheton kai ton allon
   patrion biblion: 14 f. ho nomos kai hai propheteiai kai ta loipa ton
   biblion). It is also recognised in the New Testament, where the Law and
   the Prophets are mentioned as authoritative collections, and in one
   passage the 'Writings' are represented by the Psalter (Lc. xxiv. 44
   panta ta gegrammena en to nomo Mouseos kai tois prophetais kai
   psalmois). But the New Testament has no comprehensive name for the
   third group, and even Josephus (c. Ap. i. 8) speaks of four poetical
   books (probably Psalms, Job, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes) as forming with
   the Law and the Prophets the entire series of sacred books; the rest of
   the Hagiographa seem to have been counted by him among the Prophets
   [453] . At Alexandria the later books were probably attached to the
   canon by a looser bond. The writer of the De vita contemplativa appears
   to recognise four groups [454] (§ 3 nomous, kai logia thespisthenta dia
   propheton, kai humnous, kai ta alla hois episteme kai eusebeia
   sunauxontai kai teleiountai).

   Only the first of the three Palestinian groups remains undisturbed
   [455] in the Alexandrian Greek Bible, as it is preserved to us in MSS.
   and described in Christian lists. When the Law was translated into
   Greek, it was already a complete collection, hedged round with special
   sanctions, and in all forms of the Greek Bible it retains its
   precedence and has resisted any extensive intrusion of foreign matter.
   It is otherwise with the Prophets and the Hagiographa. Neither of these
   groups escaped decomposition when it passed into the Greek Bible. The
   Former Prophets are usually separated from the Latter, the poetical
   books coming between. The Hagiographa are entirely broken up, the
   non-poetical books being divided between the histories and the
   prophets. This distribution is clearly due to the characteristically
   Alexandrian desire to arrange the books according to their literary
   character or contents, or their supposed authorship. Histories were
   made to consort with histories, prophetic and poetical writings with
   others of their respective kinds. On this principle Daniel is in all
   Greek codices and catalogues one of the Greater Prophets, while Ruth
   attaches itself to Judges, and Canticles to Ecclesiastes.

   In many of the Greek patristic lists the Alexandrian principle of
   grouping receives express recognition. Thus Cyril of Jerusalem, Gregory
   of Nazianzus, and Leontius, divide the books of the Old Testament into
   (1) historical--12, including the Mosaic Pentateuch; (2) poetical--5;
   (3) prophetical--5. Epiphanius, followed by John of Damascus,
   endeavours to combine this grouping with a system of pentateuchs [456]
   --(1) legal, (2) poetical, (3) historical [457] , (4) prophetical --an
   end which he attains by relegating Ezra and Esther to an appendix.
   Pseudo-Chrysostom's arrangement is similar, though slightly different
   in some of its details; according to his view the Bible began with an
   Octateuch, and the stichera are broken up, the Psalter being placed
   with the Prophets, and the Salomonic books described as 'hortatory
   [458] ' (to suibouleutikon). Even in the eccentric arrangement of
   Junilius [459] the Greek method of grouping is clearly dominant.

   The relative order of the groups in the Greek Bible, being of literary
   and not historical origin, is to some extent liable to variation. The
   'five books of Moses' always claim precedence, and the 'rest of the
   histories' follow, but the position of the poetical and prophetical
   books is less certain. Codex B places the poetical books first, whilst
   in Codd. ' and A the prophets precede. But the order of cod. B is
   supported by the great majority of authorities both Eastern and Western
   (Melito, Origen, Athanasius, Cyril, Epiphanius (1, 3), Gregory,
   Amphilochius, the Laodicene and 'Apostolic' canons, Nicephorus,
   Pseudo-Chrysostom, the Cheltenham list, the African canons of 397, and
   Augustine). Two reasons may have combined to favour this arrangement.
   'David' and 'Solomon' were higher up the stream of time than Hosea and
   Isaiah. Moreover, it may have seemed fitting that the Prophets should
   immediately precede the Evangelists.


   (3) THE NUMBER OF THE BOOKS. In our printed Hebrew Bibles the books of
   the Old Testament are 39 (Law, 5; Former Prophets (Joshua--2 Kings), 6;
   Latter Prophets, 15; Hagiographa, 13). But Samuel, Kings,
   Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles [460] , were originally single books
   [461] , and the Minor Prophets were also counted as a single book. Thus
   the number is reduced to 24 (Law, 5; Former Prophets, 4; Latter
   Prophets, 4; Hagiographa, 11), and this answers to the prevalent Jewish
   tradition. On the other hand Josephus expressly limits the books to 22
   (Law, 5; Prophets, i3; Hymns and moral pieces, 4). He has probably
   included the historical Hagiographa among the Prophets, and treated
   Ruth and Lamentations as appendices to Judges and Jeremiah
   respectively.

   Both traditions were inherited by the Church, but the latter was
   predominant, especially in the East. In some lists indeed the
   twenty-two books became twenty-seven, the 'double books' being broken
   up into their parts (Epiph. 1) [462] ; in some a similar treatment of
   the Dodecapropheton raised the number to 34 (the 'Sixty Books'), and
   there are other eccentricities of numeration which need not be
   mentioned here.


   Josephus, c. Ap. i. 8: ou muriades biblion eisi par' hemin asumphonon
   kai machomenon, duo mona pros tois eikosi biblia . . . kai touton pente
   men esti Mouseos . . . hoi meta Mousen prophetai . . . sunegrapsan en
   trisi kai deka bibliois; hai de loipai tessares humnous eis ton theon
   kai tois anthropois hupothekas tou biou periechousin. He is followed by
   Origen ap. Eus. l.c. ouk agnoeteon d' einai tas endiathekous biblous
   hos Ebraioi paradidoasin, hosos ho arithmos ton par autois stoicheion
   estin; and Cyril. Hier. catech. iv. 33 anaginoske tas theias graphas,
   tas eikosi duo biblous tes palaias diathekes. Similarly Athanasius, ep.
   fest. 39 (Migne, P.G. xxvi. col. 1437). When another numeration was
   adopted, efforts were made to shew that it did not involve a real
   departure from the canon of twenty-two; cf. Epiph. haer. i. I. 8,
   hautai eisin hai eikosi hepta bibloi hai ek theou dotheisai tois
   Ioudaiois, eikosi duo de hos ta par autois stoicheia ton Ebraikon
   grammaton arithmoumenai dia to diplousthai deka biblous eis pente
   legomenas; dial. Tim. et Aq. (ed. Conybeare, p. 66), hautai hai bibloi
   hai theopneustoi kai endiathetoi, ks' men ousai, kb' de arithmoumenai
   dia to . . . ex auton diplousthai.

   On the other hand the numeration in 4 Esdr. xiv. 44 rests, if nongenti
   quatuor be the true reading, on a tradition which makes the Hebrew
   books 24. This tradition is supported by the testimony of the Talmud
   and the Rabbinical literature [463] , and the Canon is known in Jewish
   writings by the name kd sphrym, "the Twenty-Four Books." It finds a
   place in certain Western Christian writers, e.g. Victorinus of Petau
   comm. in Apoc.: "sunt autem libri V.T. qui accipiuntur viginti quatuor
   quos in epitome Theodori invenies [464] ." Victorinus compares the 24
   books to the 24 Elders of Apoc. iv., and the same fancy finds a place
   in the Cheltenham list ("ut in apocalypsi Iohannis dictum est Vidi
   XXIIII seniores mittentes coronas suas ante thronum, maiores nostri
   probant hoc libros esse canonicos"). Jerome knows both traditions,
   though he favours the former (Prol. Gal. "quomodo igitur viginti duo
   elementa sunt . . . ita viginti duo volumina supputantur . . . quamquam
   nonnulli Ruth et Cinoth inter Hagiograpba scriptitent et libros hos in
   suo putent numero supputandos et per hoc esse priscae legis libros
   viginti quatuor").


   Let us now turn to the ecclesiastical lists and see how far the Hebrew
   Canon was maintained.

   Our earliest Christian list was obtained from Palestine [465] , and
   probably represents the contents of the Palestinian Greek Bible. It is
   an attempt to answer the question, What is the true number and order of
   the books of the Old Testament? Both the titles and the grouping are
   obviously Greek, but the books are exclusively those of the Hebrew
   canon. Esther does not appear, but the number of the books is
   twenty-two, if we are intended to count 1--4 Regn. as two.

   The next list comes from Origen. It belongs to his commentary on the
   first Psalm, which was written at Alexandria [466] , i.e. before A.D.
   231. The books included in it are expressly said to be the twenty-two
   of the Hebrew canon eisi de hai eikosi duo bibloi kath' Hebraious
   haide). Yet among them are the first book of Esdras [467] and the
   Epistle of Jeremiah, which the Jews never recognised. With the addition
   of Baruch, Origen's list is repeated by Athanasius, Cyril, Epiphanius
   (1), and in the Laodicean canon; Amphilochius mentions two books of
   Esdras, and it is at least possible that the Esdras of Gregory of
   Nazianzus is intended to include both books, and that the Epistle, or
   Baruch and the Epistle, are to be understood as forming part of
   Jeremiah in the lists both of Gregory and Amphilochius. Thus it appears
   that an expansion of the Hebrew canon, which involved no addition to
   the number of the books, was predominant in the East during the fourth
   century.

   The Eastern lists contain other books, but they are definitely placed
   outside the Canon. This practice seems to have begun with Origen, who
   after enumerating the twenty-two books adds, exo de touton esti ta
   Makkabaika. Athanasius takes up the expression, but names other
   books--the two Wisdoms, Esther [468] , Judith, and Tobit [469] .
   Palestine was perhaps naturally conservative in this matter; Cyril will
   not allow his catechumens to go beyond the Canon, and Epiphanius
   mentions only, and that with some hesitation, the two books of Wisdom
   (eisi de kai allai par autois bibloi en amphilekto [470] . . . hautai
   chresimoi men eisi kai ophelimoi, all' eis arithmon rheton ouk
   anapherontai) [471] . And this was the prevalent attitude of the East
   even at a later time. There are exceptions; Pseudo-Chrysostom places
   Sirach among the Hortatory books of the canon; the Apostolic canons,
   while excluding Sirach, include three books of Maccabees. But John of
   Damascus reflects the general opinion of the Greek fathers when, while
   reckoning both books of Esdras [472] as canonical, he repeats the
   verdict of Epiphanius upon the two Wisdoms, Eearetoi men kai kalai,
   all' ouk arithmountai [473] .

   On the other hand the West, further from the home of the Hebrew canon,
   and knowing the Old Testament chiefly through the Latin version of the
   LXX., did not scruple to mingle non-canonical books with the canonical.
   Hilary and Ruffinus [474] were doubtless checked, the one by the
   influence of Eastern theologians, the other by the scholarship of
   Jerome; but Hilary mentions that there were those who wished to raise
   the number of the canonical books to twenty-four by including Tobit and
   Judith in the canon. From the end of the fourth century the inclusion
   of the non-canonical books in Western lists is a matter of course. Even
   Augustine has no scruples on the subject; he makes the books of the Old
   Testament forty-four (de doctr. Chr. ii. 13 "his xliv libris Testamenti
   Veteris terminatur auctoritas [475] "), and among them Tobit, Judith,
   and two books of Maccabees take rank with the histories; and the two
   Wisdoms, although he confesses that they were not the work of Solomon,
   are classed with the Prophets. His judgement was that of his Church
   (Conc. Carth. iii. can. xlvii. "sunt canonicae scripturae Salomonis
   libri quinque . . . Tobias, Judith . . . Machabaeorum libri duo"). The
   African Church had probably never known any other canon, and its belief
   prevailed wherever the Latin Bible was read.

   There can be little doubt that, notwithstanding the strict adherence of
   the Eastern lists to the number of the Hebrew books, the Old Latin
   canon truly represents the collection of Greek sacred books which came
   into the hands of the early Christian communities at Antioch,
   Alexandria, and Rome. When Origen and the Greek fathers who follow him
   fix the number of the books at twenty-two or twenty-four, they follow,
   not the earlier tradition of the Church, but the corrected estimate of
   Christian scholars who had learned it from Jewish teachers. An earlier
   tradition is represented by the line of Christian writers, beginning
   with Clement of Rome, who quoted the 'Apocryphal' books apparently
   without suspecting that they were not part of the Canon. Thus Clement
   of Rome [476] places the story of Judith side by side with that of
   Esther; the Wisdom of Sirach is cited by Barnabas [477] and the Didache
   [478] , and Tobit by Polycarp [479] ; Clement of Alexandria [480] and
   Origen appeal to Tobit and both the Wisdoms, to which Origen adds
   Judith [481] . Our earliest MSS. of the Greek Bible confirm the
   impression derived from the quotations of the earliest Christian
   writers. Their canon corresponds not with that of the great writers of
   the age when they were written, but with that of the Old Latin version
   of the LXX. Codd. B ' A contain the two Wisdoms, Tobit, and Judith;
   1--2 Maccabees are added in ', and 1--4 Maccabees in A; cod. C still
   exhibits the two Wisdoms, and when complete may have contained other
   books of the same class. Moreover, the position of the books shews that
   the scribes of these MSS. or of their archetypes lacked either the
   power or the will to distinguish them from the books of the Hebrew
   canon. In the light of the facts already produced, it is clear that the
   presence of the non-canonical books in Greek Bibles cannot be
   attributed to the skilled writers of the fourth and fifth centuries.
   They have but perpetuated an older tradition--a tradition probably
   inherited from the Alexandrian Jews.

   An explanation of the early mixture of non-canonical books with
   canonical may be found in the form under which the Greek Bible passed
   into the keeping of the Church. In the first century the material used
   for literary purposes was still almost exclusively papyrus, and the
   form was that of the roll [482] . But rolls of papyrus seldom contained
   more than a single work, and writings of any length, especially if
   divided into books, were often transcribed into two or more separate
   rolls [483] . The rolls were kept in boxes (kibotoi, kistai, capsae,
   sistae) [484] , which served not only to preserve them, but to collect
   them in sets. Now while the sanctity of the five books of Moses would
   protect the cistae which contained them from the intrusion of foreign
   rolls, no scruple of this kind would deter the owner of a roll of
   Esther from placing it in the same box with Judith and Tobit; the
   Wisdoms in like manner naturally found their way into a Salomonic
   collection; while in a still larger number of instances the two Greek
   recensions of Esdras consorted together, and Baruch and the Epistle
   seemed rightly to claim a place with the roll of Jeremiah. More rarely
   such a writing as the Psalms of Solomon may have found its way into the
   company of kindred books of the canon. It is not a serious objection to
   this hypothesis that Philo does not quote the Apocrypha, and has no
   certain allusion to it [485] . A great scholar would not be deceived by
   the mixture of heterogeneous rolls, which might nevertheless seriously
   mislead ordinary readers, and start a false tradition in an unlettered
   community such as the Christian society of the first century.


   (4) THE INTERNAL ORDER OF THE GROUPS. Even in Jewish lists of the
   Hebrew Canon there are variations in the internal order of the Prophets
   and the Hagiographa. The 'Great Prophets' occur in each of the three
   orders (1) Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel; (2) Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah;
   (3) Jeremiah, Isaiah, Ezekiel [486] . The order of the Hagiographa
   varies more extensively. In the printed Bibles they are arranged in
   three subdivisions: (1) Psalms, Proverbs, Job; (2) Canticles, Ruth,
   Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther (the five Megilloth); (3) Daniel,
   Ezra, Chronicles. The Talmudic order is as follows: Ruth, Psalms, Job,
   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther,
   Chronicles. The MSS. vary, many agreeing with the printed Bibles;
   others, especially those of Spanish provenance, following the order:
   Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Canticles, Ecclesiastes,
   Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra [487] .

   In the lists of the Greek Bible and the sequence of its MSS. the Law
   and the 'Former Prophets' generally retain their Hebrew order, with the
   noteworthy exception that Ruth is always attached to Judges. But there
   are also minor exceptions which are of some interest. Even in the
   Pentateuch Melito, Leontius, and the Cheltenham list reverse the common
   order of Leviticus and Numbers [488] . The sequence is broken in some
   lists after Ruth (Laod., Epiph. 1), or even after Joshua (Epiph. 3
   [489] ) or Deuteronomy (Epiph. 1). Occasionally Chronicles, which is an
   intruder from the Hagiographa, precedes 1--4 Regn. (Epiph. 2, Dial.
   Tim. et Aq.), or drops out altogether (Ps.-Chrys., Junilius, Cod.
   Clarom.). All these disturbances of the normal order may be ascribed to
   local or individual influences, and find no support in the uncial MSS.
   of the Greek Bible. But it is otherwise when we come to the 'Latter
   Prophets' and the Hagiographa. With regard to the Prophets, three
   questions of order arise. (1) There is the relative order of the Twelve
   and the Four. In the majority of patristic lists the Twelve precede
   (Ath., Cyr., Epiph., Greg., Amph., &c.), and this is also the order of
   Codd. A, B, N-V. But Cod. ' begins with the Four, and it is supported
   by other authorities, chiefly Western (Ruff, Chelt., Ps.-Gelasius,
   Cassiodorius, Nicephorus); whilst in a few the subdivisions are mixed
   (Melito, Junilius, Ebedjesu [490] ). (2) The internal order of the
   dodekapropheton in most of the MSS. and catalogues [491] where it is
   stated differs from the Hebrew order in regard to the relative
   positions of the prophets in the first half of the group; the Hebrew
   order being Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, but the Greek,
   Hosea, Amos, Micah, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah. The dominant Greek order may
   perhaps be due to "an attempt to secure greater accuracy in the
   chronological arrangement [492] ." (3) The Greek order of the Greater
   Prophets follows the oldest Hebrew tradition (Isaiah, Jeremiah,
   Ezekiel), but it appends Lamentations to Jeremiah, and enlarges the
   group by placing Daniel either before (Melito, Origen, Hilary, Chelt.,
   Augustine), or, more usually, after Ezekiel.

   The relative order of the Hagiographa in the LXX. is more perplexing.
   For Ruth, Lamentations, and Daniel we have already accounted; there
   remain Chronicles, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,
   Esther, and Ezra. Chronicles, in accordance with the theory enshrined
   in its Greek name, usually follows Kings. Psalms, Proverbs,
   Ecclesiastes, Canticles, for the most part hold together in that order,
   as a group of poetical books; but there are many exceptions. 'David'
   sometimes goes with the Prophets (Ps.-Chrys., Junilius, Augustine,
   Isidorus), and the group is then regarded as 'Salomonic,' or
   'hortatory.' Lists which admit the two books of Wisdom usually join
   them to this subdivision (Ebedjesu, Carth., Augustine, Innocent, Cod.
   Clarom., Ps.-Gelasius, Cassiodorius, Isidorus). The internal order of
   the Salomonic books varies (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles;
   Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Proverbs; Proverbs, Canticles, Ecclesiastes);
   the Wisdoms usually follow, but sometimes break the sequence of the
   three canonical books. Much difficulty seems to have been felt as to
   the place of Job; the book normally appears in connexion with the
   poetical books, either last or first, but it is sometimes placed among
   the histories (Augustine, Innocent, Cod Clarom., Ps.-Gelasius,
   Cassiodorius), or after the Prophets (Origen). The position of Esdras
   is not less uncertain; its normal place is after Chronicles, but it is
   also found before or after the Prophets (Melito, Epiph., John of
   Damascus, Cod. Barocc.), or in connexion with a group of the apocryphal
   histories (cod. A, Carth., Augustine, &c.). Esther is still more
   erratic; sometimes it follows the poetical books, sometimes the
   Prophets, sometimes the histories; not a few lists place it among the
   antilegomena, or omit it altogether. When admitted to a place in the
   Canon, it is usually to be found at or near the end (Origen,
   Epiphanius, Amphilochius, John of Damascus, Hilary, Carth., Cod.
   Clarom., Ps.-Gelasius, Cassiodorius), and in company with apocryphal
   books, especially Judith [493] and Tobit (codd. B'A, Chelt., Carth.,
   Augustine, and the later Latin lists [494] ). It seems as if the doubt
   which the Jewish authorities felt with regard to this book was
   inherited by many Christians. On the other hand Cyril, who represents
   the tradition of the Church of Jerusalem, makes it the twelfth of the
   canonical books, and in the Laodicene list it stands eighth.

   Except in cases where an old or well-defined tradition fixed the
   internal order of groups of books, there was clearly room for every
   possible variation so long as the books were written on separate rolls.
   The cista might serve to keep a group together, but it offered no means
   of fixing the relative order of its contents. In the codex, on the
   other hand, when it contained more than one writing, the order was
   necessarily fixed [495] , and the scribe unconsciously created a
   tradition which was followed by later copyists. The 'transition to
   vellum,' and the consequent transition from the roll to the codex, does
   not seem to have been general before the fourth century, although in
   the case of Biblical MSS. it may have begun a century earlier [496] ;
   and thus we may regard our earliest uncial codices as prototypes of the
   variations in order which mark the mass of later MSS. A single instance
   may suffice. It has been stated that Esther is frequently found in
   company with Judith and Tobit. But these books occur in varying order
   in the oldest MSS.; in B we have Esther, Judith, Tobit, but in ' A,
   Esther, Tobit, Judith; a favourite Western order is Tobit, Esther,
   Judith (Chelt., Augustine, Innocent, Gelasius, Cassiodorius, Isidorus);
   another, sanctioned at Carthage in 397, is apparently more common in
   MSS. of the Vulgate, viz., Tobit, Judith, Esther [497] . Such
   variations, resting on no obvious principle, are doubtless ultimately
   due to the judgement or caprice of a few scribes, whose copies supplied
   the archetypes of the later Greek MSS. and the daughter-versions of the
   Septuagint.

   [432] Origen includes Ruth with Judges under Saphateim.

   [433] Epiph. l.c.: esti de kai alle mikra biblos he kaleitai Kinoth

   [434] This list has been adapted from Ryle, Canon of the O.T. (table

   [436] Lagarde, l.c.: "ich widerhole sie, von mir redigiert."

   [437] The B.M. MS. counts Ruth as a separate book and after Daniel
   places the numeral le'.

   [438] "Quibusdam autem visum est additis Tobia et Judith xxiv libros
   secundum numerum Graecarum literarum connumerare."

   [439] Of the canonicity of these two books Augustine speaks with some
   reserve: "de quadam similitudine Salomonis esse dicuntur . . . qui
   tamen quoniam in auctoritatem recipi meruerunt inter propheticos
   numerandi sunt."

   [440] The text of Preuschen has been followed; it is based on a St Gall
   MS. which appears to be less corrupt than the Cheltenham MS. used by
   Mommsen and others.

   [441] See also the Latin list printed by Mr C. H. Turner in J. Th. St.
   i. 557 ff.

   [442] Or less correctly Paraleipomenoi, 'omitted books,' as in some
   lists.

   [443] On this rendering see Driver, Deuteronomy, p. i. The Massora
   calls the book msgh htvrh.

   [445] See Prof. Ryle's Philo and Holy Scripture, p. xx. ff.

   [446] So in Cohn-Wendland's edition (iii. 4, 57, 230); in ii. 271 this
   title is ascribed to Moses, although exagoge does not like exodos occur
   in the Alexandrian version of the book. He Exagoge was also the title
   of the Hellenist Ezekiel's poem on the Exodus (see below, p. 371).

   [447] Cf. the change from mlkym to Basileiai.

   [448] See Ryle, Canon of the O. T., p. 294.

   [449] Sometimes in a simple transliteration, as Genesis &c. Tertullian
   has Arithmi but in Cyprian the Latin Numeri is already used; see
   Burkitt, O. L. and Itala, p. 4.

   [450] The official Vulgate had Canticum, until the plural was adopted
   by Sixtus V.; see Nestle, ein Jubiläum der Lat. Bibel, p. 18.

   [454] Unless we omit the comma after humnous and regard hu. kai ta alla
   as = the Hagiographa; cf. Joseph. c. Ap. as quoted below, p. 220.

   [455] Yet even the Torah was not always kept apart in the Greek Bible,
   as the names Octateuch and Heptateuch witness.

   [456] Dr Sanday (in Studia Biblica, iii. p. 240) regards this as
   Palestinian, identifying it with Cyril's method. But Cyril begins with
   a dodecad (dodekate he Esther; kai ta men Historika tauta).

   [457] The term grapheia (ktvvym) or hagiographa is transferred to this
   group.

   [458] So Leontius ta tarainetika), but he classed the Psalter among
   them.

   [459] See Kihn, Theodor v. Mopsuestia u. Junilius, p. 356 f.

   [460] Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah appears to have been originally a single
   book. But while Ezra and Nehemiah are still joined in the Greek Bible,
   Chronicles stands by itself both in and , and in it follows Nehemiah
   and forms the last book of the Canon (cf. Mt. xxiii. 35, and see Barnes
   Chronicles, in the Cambridge Bible, pp. x.--xiii.).

   [461] The division probably began in the LXX.

   [462] Jerome, Prol. Gal.: "quinque a plerisque libri duplices
   aestimantur." As the twenty-two books answered to the twenty-two
   letters of the Hebrew alphabet, so these 'double books' were thought to
   correspond to the 'double letters,' i.e. those which had two forms (k
   ,m ,n ,ph ,ts). The 'double books were not always identical in
   different lists; see Sanday, op. cit. p. 239.

   [463] Cf. Ryle Canon, pp. 157 f., 222, 292; Sanday, op. cit. p. 236 ff.

   [464] Zahn offers a suggestion, to which Sanday inclines, that the
   writer refers to the Excerpta ex Theodoto which are partly preserved in
   the works of Clement of Alexandria.

   [465] Melito ap. Eus. H.E. iv. 26 epeide mathein ten ton palaion

   [466] Eus. H.E. vi. 24.

   [467] Already cited freely by Josephus as an authority for the history
   of the period. Origen, it should be added, regards 1, 2 Esdras as a
   single volume (Esdras prote, deutera en heni).

   [468] Cf. Melito's omission of Esther, and the note appended to the
   list of Amphilochius.

   [472] Like Origen, he explains that they form together but a single
   book (tou Esdra hai duo eis mian sunaptomenai biblon).

   [473] The non-canonical books (ta exo) are however carefully
   distinguished from real apocrypha when the latter are mentioned; e.g.
   in the stichometry of Nicephorus, and in the list of the 'Sixty Books.'

  CHAPTER II.

    BOOKS OF THE HEBREW CANON.

   THE books which are common to the Hebrew Bible and the Alexandrian
   Version [498] differ in regard to their contents as well as in their
   titles and order. Differences of contents may conveniently be
   considered under two heads, as they affect the sequence or the
   subject-matter.


   (A) DIFFERENCES OF SEQUENCE.


   1. The following table shews the principal instances in which the Greek
   and the Hebrew books are at variance in reference to the order of the
   contents. The chapters and verses in the left-hand column are those of
   the Cambridge Septuagint; the right-hand column follows the numeration
   of the printed Hebrew Bibles.

   2. Each of these contexts must be separately examined with the view of
   discovering the extent and the cause of the divergence. This can be
   done but briefly here; for further particulars the student is referred
   to the commentaries which deal with the several books.

   In the following pages = the Greek text, and ^A, B, etc. = the Greek
   text as given in cod. A, cod. B, or as the case may be; = the
   Massoretic text as printed in the Hebrew Bibles.


   GEN. xxxi. 46 ff. The passage is in some confusion; "vv. 45, 47, 51--54
   appear to embody E's account . . . vv. 46, 48--50 the account given by
   J [499] ." is loosely put together, and v. 50^b, which omits, is hardly
   consistent with vv. 48, 52. In the materials seem to have been
   re-arranged with the view of giving greater consistency to the
   narrative.

   GEN. xxxv. 16 ff. The transposition in appears to be due to a desire to
   locate Eder (Gader;) between Bethel and Bethlehem: see art. EDER in
   Hastings' D. B. (i. p. 644).

   EXOD. xx. 13--15. and represent here two distinct traditions with
   regard to the order of the Decalogue. For the order followed by ^B see
   Lc. xviii. 20, Rom. xiii. 9, Jas. ii. 11, Philo de x. orac. 10, de
   spec. legg. iii. 2; that of ^AF is supported by Mt., Mc., and Josephus.
   In Deut. v. 17--19 cod. B wavers between the two, but cod. A
   consistently agrees with [500] .

   EXOD. xxxv.--xl. is "the sequel to c. xxv.-xxxi., relating the
   execution of the instructions there communicated to Moses," the
   correspondence being so close that "in the main, the narrative is
   repeated verbatim--with the single substitution of past tenses for
   future [501] ." But whilst in c. xxv. ff. the LXX. generally follows
   the Massoretic order, in the corresponding sections at the end of the
   book "extraordinary variations occur in the Greek, some verses being
   omitted altogether, while others are transposed and knocked about with
   a freedom very unlike the usual manner of the translators of the
   Pentateuch [502] ."

   The passage deals with the building and furniture of the Tabernacle,
   and the attire of the Priesthood: The following rough table will enable
   the student to see how the detail are arranged in the LXX. and Heb.
   severally.


   Ornaments of the Ministers. Structure of the Tabernacle.
   Ephod (xxxvi. 9--12). Hangings (xxxvi. 8--19).
   Onyx stones (xxxvi. 13--14). Boards (xxxvi. 20--34).
   Breastplate (xxxvi. 15--29). Veils (xxxvi. 35--38).
   Robe of Ephod (xxxvi. 30--34)
   Linen vestments (xxxvi. 35--37). Furniture of the Tabernacle and its
   Court.
   Crown plate (xxxvi. 38--40). Ark (xxxvii. 1--9).
     Table (xxxvii. 10--16).
   Structure of the Tabernacle, and Court.  Candlestick (xxxvii. 17--24).
   Hangings (xxxvii. 1--2). Altar of incense (xxxvii. 25--29).
   Veils (xxxvii. 3--6). Altar of Burnt-offering (xxxviii. 1--7).
   Court (xxxvii. 7--18). Laver (xxxviii. 8).
     Court (xxxviii. 9-20).
   Furniture of the Tabernacle, &c. Ornaments of the Ministers.
   Ark (xxxviii. 1--8). Ephod (xxxix. 2--5).
   Table (xxxviii. 9--12). Onyx stones (xxxix. 6--7).
   Candlestick (xxxviii. 13--17). Breastplate (xxxix. 8--21).
   Altar of Burnt-offering (xxxviii. 22--24). Robe of the Ephod (xxxix.
   22--26).
   Oil and Incense (xxxviii. 25--26). Linen vestments (xxxix. 27--29).
   Laver (xxxviii. 17). Crown plate (xxxix. 30--31.


   It is clear from this comparison that both and follow a system, i.e.
   that the difference of sequence is due to a deliberate rearrangement of
   the groups. Either the Alexandrian translator has purposely changed
   their relative order, giving precedence to the ornaments of the
   priesthood which are subordinated in the M. T. of cc. xxxv.--xl., as
   well as in both texts of cc. xxv.--xxx.; or he had before him in c.
   xxxv. ff. another Hebrew text in which the present Greek order was
   observed. Many O. T. scholars (e.g. Kuenen, Wellhausen, Dillmann)
   regard cc. xxxv.--xl. as belonging to a "secondary and posterior
   stratum of P [503] ." Thus it is permissible to suppose that the Hebrew
   text before the original translators of Exodus did not contain this
   section, and that it was supplied afterwards from a longer Hebrew
   recension of the book in which the last six chapters had not yet
   reached their final form. That the translation of these chapters was
   not made by the same hand as the rest of Exodus has been gathered from
   the fact that the Hebrew technical terms which are common to xxv.--xxx.
   and xxxv.--xl. are in certain cases differently rendered in the two
   contexts [504] .


   NUMBERS i. 24 ff., xxvi. 15 ff. Each of these passages contains a
   census of the tribes, and in each the order of the tribes is slightly
   different in and . In both lists places Gad third, and Asher eleventh;
   whereas according to Gad is ninth in the first of the two lists, and
   sixth in the second, and in the second Asher is seventh. The effect of
   the sequence presented by is to bring Gad into close proximity to
   Asher, a position which this tribe occupies in i. 5--15 ( and ). For
   this there may have been genealogical reasons; see Gen. xxx. 10 ff.,
   xlix. 19.

   C. vi. 22 ff. Here obviously has the simpler and more natural order,
   and legontes autois at the end of v. 23 seems to shew that the Greek
   order, though supported by BA'*, is the result of an early accidental
   displacement in the Greek text.


   JOSHUA ix. 3 ff. In the present Hebrew text the ceremony at Ebal and
   Gerizim follows immediately upon the taking of Ai, but in it is
   separated from the latter incident by the hostile gathering of the
   western kings (ix. 1, 2) and placed immediately before the story of the
   Gibeonites. "involves a geographical difficulty, for Ebal lies
   considerably to the north of Ai, and until the intervening territory
   was conquered . . . it is difficult to understand how Joshua could have
   advanced thither [505] ." The situation however is scarcely improved if
   we adopt the order of , unless the gathering of the kings is taken to
   imply a further victory on the Israelite side which opened the way to
   central Palestine. Dillmann suggests that ix. 2 was once followed by
   the details of a battle. If so, it is possible that still preserves the
   original order, though in common with it has lost this record.

   C. xix. 47--48. On these verses, which exchange places in the Greek,
   see under (B) [506] .


   3 REGN. iv. 17 ff.

   The change of order in vv. 17--19 needs no discussion; the
   transposition may be due to an accident of transcription in the
   archetype of Cod. B, or, like the variations in Num. i., xxvi., to some
   consideration connected with the placing of the tribes. The real
   problem of the passage begins at iv. 20. Its nature may best be
   understood from a table of the contents. These consist of the details
   of Solomon's personal greatness and public works; the facts are
   arranged by ^B and respectively as follows:


   Provision for the royal table (iv. 20--23). Solomon's marriage (iii.
   1).
   Solomon's power (iv. 24). Provision for the royal table (v. 2f., 7f.)
   His wisdom (iv. 25--30). The King's power (v. 4).
   His marriage (iv. 31). His wisdom (v. 9--14).
   His wife's dowry (iv. 32 ff.). His negociations with King Hiram (v.
   15--25).
   His negociations with King Hiram (v. 1--12). His corvée of workmen (v.
   27--32).
   His corvée of workmen (v. 13--17). Foundations of the Temple laid (vi.
   1).
   Foundations of the Temple laid (vi. 1--5). Dimensions of the Temple
   (vi. 6).
   Dimensions of the Temple (vi. 6 f.). Details of the building (vi. 2, 7,
   36)

   Details of the building (vi. 8--34).         Building of the royal palaces
                                                (vii. 1--12).
   Work of Hiram the artist (vii. 1--37).       Work of Hiram the artist (vii.
                                                12--51).
   Building of the royal palaces (vii. 38--50). Solomon's wife's dowry
                                                (ix. 16 f.).


   As in the disturbed section at the end of Exodus, it is easy to see
   that each order follows a system: (1) Whilst places the marriage of
   Solomon to Pharaoh's daughter, and the use made by the king of his
   wife's marriage portion, in their historical settings, ^B brings the
   two incidents together, as the finishing strokes to the picture of
   Solomon's power. Again, whilst deals with the whole of Solomon's public
   works before it describes the skill of Hiram, ^B completes the history
   of the building of the Temple with the account of Hiram's labours
   before it describes the construction of the royal palaces.

   The above comparison is necessarily rough; it does not shew' the minor
   differences of order, or the omissions and additions of the Greek text.
   A closer examination leaves little doubt that ^B has been translated
   from a recension of the book earlier than that which is preserved in
   the Massoretic text [507] .

   C. x. 23--33. The text of ^B, Luc. here admits two passages which it
   had passed over in the earlier contexts, where they stand in (c. ix.
   15, 17--22, v. 1). Of ix. 10--28 Prof. Driver remarks that it "consists
   of a series of notices imperfectly connected together," and that its
   "literary form . . . is, for same reason, less complete than that of
   any other portion of the Books of Kings [508] ." Under these
   circumstances it is not surprising that some of these notices occupied
   another place in the text which was before the Alexandrian translator.
   C. v. 1^a, which in the Greek order is x. 30, belongs in to another
   similar collection of loosely-connected paragraphs. The arrangement
   followed by ^B is perhaps not materially better, but it probably
   represents an earlier stage in the formation of the book.

   C. xi. 3-8. Here ^B, Luc. presents a text which differs from ^A and
   both in order and in form. A comparison of ^B with ^A and will be found
   to be instructive; the latter is diffuse and repeats itself
   unnecessarily (3 eklinan gunaikes autou ten kardian autou . . . 4 hai
   gunaikes autou exeklinan ten kardian autou . . . 5 eporeuthe Salomon
   opiso tes Astartes . . . 7 tote okodomesen S. hupselon . . . te
   Astarte); former presents the facts [509] briefly and in a logical
   sequence. Here as elsewhere in this book Cod. A represents the
   Hexaplaric Greek, and not the original LXX. [510]

   Cc. xx., xxi. The relative order of these chapters is reversed in which
   justifies the change by prefacing the story of Naboth with the words
   vyhy 'chr hdvrym h'lh. "The dislocation may have been due to the desire
   to bring the prophecy of Ahab's death nearer to the account of its
   occurrence [511] ." Obviously wrong as the present Hebrew order is,
   Cod. A has adopted it, interpolating the inapposite egeneto meta ta
   rhemata tauta, which Origen had borrowed from Aquila; and even Lucian
   (if he is here rightly represented by Lagarde) has been led into the
   same error, though he seems to retain the true sequence of the
   chapters.


   PSALMS ix.--cxlvii.

   Throughout the greater part of the Psalter and follow different systems
   of numeration. This is due to certain consecutive Psalms in the Hebrew
   Psalter being counted as one in the Greek (ix. + x. Heb. = ix. LXX.;
   cxiv. + cxv. Heb. = cxiii. LXX.), and certain of the Hebrew Psalms
   being vice versa divided in the Greek into two (cxvi. Heb. = cxiv. +
   cxv. LXX.; cxlvii. Heb. = cxlvi. + cxlvii. LXX.).

   In the Heb. Psalms ix. and x. there are traces of an acrostic system
   which have been taken to indicate that the two Psalms were originally
   one [512] . Many Hebrew MSS. join Psalms cxiv., cxv. [513] , as in the
   LXX. For the division of Psalms cxvi. and cxlvii. it is less easy to
   account, but it may have been due to a desire to make up the number of
   the Psalms to 150 [514] .


   PROVERBS xxiv.--xxxi.

   In the first great section of this book (cc. i.--ix.) there is no
   important difference of order, nor does the second section (x.--xxii.
   1^b) or the third (xxii. 17--xxiv. 22) offer more than an occasional
   variation in the grouping of proverbs, combined with omissions and
   additions on either side. But at c. xxiv. 23 we enter upon a series of
   collections which seem at one time to have formed distinct books or
   cycles of proverbial teaching, and here and differ widely, as a
   comparison of the contents will shew.


   Words of Agur (xxiv. 24--37).             Sayings of the Wise (xxiv. 23--34).
   Sayings of the Wise (xxiv. 38--49).       Proverbs of Solomon (xxv. 1--xxix.
                                             21).
   Rest of the Words of Agur (xxiv. 50--68). Words of Agur (xxx. 1--33).

   Words of Lemuel (xxiv. 69--77).              Words of Lemuel (xxxi. 1--9).
   Proverbs of Solomon (xxv. 1--xxix. 27).      Praise of the Virtuous Woman
                                                (xxxi. 10--31).
   Praise of the Virtuous Woman (xxix. 28--49).


   Evidently the order of this portion of the book had not been finally
   settled when the Alexandrian translator did his work [515] . Moreover
   he has failed to understand the headings of the two sections attributed
   to Agur and Lemuel [516] , and has broken up Agur's collection, the
   unity of which he seems not to have recognised, placing the Sayings of
   the Wise between the fragments; unless, indeed, he found them divided
   in his Hebrew archetype.


   JEREMIAH xxv.-li. A glance at the table which stands near the beginning
   of this chapter will shew that the section c. xxv. 15--xlv. 5 ( )
   answers in a general way to c. xxxii. 1--li. 35 ( ), whilst c. xlvi.
   1--li. 64 ( ) is represented, though not without considerable
   interruptions of the present Hebrew order, by c. xxv. 14--xxxi. 44 ( ).
   Speaking roughly these two sections have exchanged places in the Greek
   text [517] . In the prophecies against the nations precede the parable
   of the intoxicating cup (xxv. 15 ff. = xxxii. 1 ff.); in they form the
   final section of the book, coming immediately before the historical
   appendix (c. lii.). If these prophecies were circulated in a separate
   form, the words of c. xxv. 13 might naturally have led an Alexandrian
   collector to place them where they stand in the LXX., whereas in
   Palestine they were treated as a postscript to the earlier collections
   and placed after xlv. 5. The two texts differ however not only in
   regard to the place which they assign to the section as a whole, but in
   the relative order of the prophecies. The order of the nations
   denounced is in Elam, Egypt, Babylon, Philistia, Edom, Ammon, Kedar,
   Damascus, Moab; but in , Egypt, Philistia, Moab, Ammon, Edom, Damascus,
   Kedar, Elam, Babylon. The prophecies had apparently been grouped in the
   Alexandrian collection after one manner, and after another in the
   collection which was current in Palestine.


   EZEKIEL vii. 3-9. Here the divergence of the LXX. from the Hebrew text
   was noticed by Jerome, who writes: "in hoc capitulo iuxta LXX.
   interpretes ordo mutatus est et confusus, ita ut prima novissima sint
   et novissima vel prima vel media, ipsaque media nunc ad extrema nunc ad
   principia transferantur." The transposition, to whichever side it is to
   be ascribed, may be explained by the genius of the passage which is in
   "a lyric strain such as is unwonted in Ezekiel [518] ." A full
   examination of the context may be seen in Cornill [519] , who justly
   describes it as "eine stark verderbte Stelle," and finds a solution in
   the hypothesis of a doublet (cf. vv. 3--4, 7--8).


   (B) DIFFERENCES OF SUBJECT-MATTER.


   1. A further comparison of the LXX. with the Massoretic Hebrew reveals
   the presence in each text of a considerable number of passages which
   are not to be found in the other. This fact was known to Origen, and
   frankly recognised by him (ep. ad African. § 3 kai en allois de pollois
   hagiois bibliois heuromen pe men pleiona par hemin keimena e par
   Ebraiois, pe de leiponta) and the Hexapla, as we have seen [520] , was
   the result of a mistaken endeavour to assimilate the LXX. to the
   current Hebrew text. Its remains are still invaluable as bearing
   witness to the condition of both texts in the second and third
   centuries after Christ. The student who would grasp the nature and
   extent of the problem must examine them in Field's great edition; in
   this place we will content ourselves with some notice of additions and
   omissions which extend to entire verses or paragraphs.


   PENTATEUCH. As a whole, the Law has escaped material changes in either
   direction. But there are a few important exceptions In Gen. iv 8 the
   LXX. supplies the words of Cain (dielthomen eis to pedion), which are
   wanting in the Hebrew Bible. The supplementary chapters of Exodus are
   on the whole shorter in than in ; the former has nothing to answer to
   c. xxxv. 8, xxxvii. 25--28, xl. 6--8, 11, and exhibits c. xxxvi. 8-34
   in an abridged form. In the Song of Moses the last four distichs are
   expanded in into eight, thus:

     [euphranthete, ouranoi, hama auto,

     kai proskunesatosan auto huioi theou;]

     euphranthete, ethne, meta tou laou autou,

     [kai enischusatosan auto pantes angeloi theou.]

     hoti to haima ton huion autou ekdikatai,

     [kai ekdikesei] kai antapodosei diken tois echthrois,

     [kai tois misousin antapodosei, ]

     kai ekkathariei [Kurios] ten gen tou laou.

   There is nothing in which corresponds with the bracketed words of the
   version. Yet they are present in all uncial MSS. of the LXX., and were
   probably in the earlier copies of Deuteronomy which passed into the
   possession of the Christian Church. Possibly the Song was circulated in
   a separate form in more than one translation. The present Greek text
   seems to be the result of conflation, lines 1 and 3, 2 and 4, 6 and 7,
   being doublets; line 2 = 4 appears to be an adaptation of Ps. xcvi.
   (xcvii.) 7.


   JOSHUA.. Besides innumerable smaller variations in this book which shew
   that it was not regarded by the translators as sharing the peculiar
   sanctity of the Torah [521] , there are in the last four chapters
   several important contexts in which and differ by defect or excess
   [522] .

   C. xix. 47--48 . The order of these verses is reversed in , so as to
   bring the words haute he kleronomia ktl. into juxtaposition with the
   list of the Danite towns (vv. 41--46); and to each of the verses which
   have thus exchanged places the LXX. attaches a rider, based apparently
   upon Judges ii. 34 f., and describing the relations between the new
   settlers and the Amorites.

   C. xx. 4--6. Omitted in . "It is probable that the ch. in its original
   form (P) has been enlarged by additions from the law of homicide in Dt.
   (c. 19) at a comparatively late date, so that they were still wanting
   in the MSS. used by the LXX. translators [523] ."

   C. xxi. 36-37, 42 a--d. The printed Hebrew Bibles omit vv. 36-37, which
   contain the names of the Levitical cities in the territory of Reuben,
   and they seem to have been obelised in the Greek by Origen. They are
   found, however, in the majority of Hebrew MSS. [524] , and are
   necessary to the completeness of the narrative. Vv. 42 a--c are little
   more than a doublet of c. xix. 50, 51b; 42 d appears to be based upon
   c. v. 3.

   C. xxiv. 30--33. V. 30a continues the story of the flint knives (v. 7,
   xxi. 42 d). , which omits v. 31, a doublet of Judges ii. 7, adds to the
   book a postscript, v. 33 a--b, based on v. 33, 1 Sam. iv. 3 ff., Judges
   ii. 6, 11 ff., iii. 14 [525] .


   1 SAMUEL (1 REGN.).

   C. ii. 9, 10. The closing stanza of this hymn, like that of the Song of
   Moses, is presented by in a modified and expanded form. Vv. 8 c, 9 a
   are omitted in , which substitutes didous euchen . . . dikaiou
   ("apparently an attempt to accommodate the Song more closely to
   Hannah's position [526] "), and inserts in the heart of v. 10 a passage
   from Jerem. ix. 23, 24, taken from the Greek version, but with
   variations which form an instructive study:--


   1 Regn. ii. Jer. ix.
   ho phronimos en te phronesei . . . ho dunatos en te dunamei . . . ton
   Kurion, kai poiein krima kai dikaiosunen en meso tes ges. ho sophos en
   te sophia . . . ho ischuros en te ischui . . . hoti ego eimi Kurios ho
   poion eleos kai krima kai dikaiosunen epi tes ges.

   It has been noticed that 1 Regn. ii. 11 a (kai katelipen auton ekei
   enopion Kuriou) probably corresponds to 1 Sam. i. 28 b (vystchv sm
   lyhvh). If so, the Song has been inserted in and at different points in
   the narrative [527] ; and it seems to be a reasonable inference that it
   was not in the original draft of the book. Such a hypothesis will
   account for the freedom with which it has been treated in .

   Cc. xvii--xviii. This is the most important of the contexts in which ^B
   differs from ^A in the way of defect. The omitted verses contain the
   story of David's visit to the camp of Israel (xvii. 12--31); David's
   interview with Saul and Jonathan (xvii. 55--xviii. 5); Saul's attempts
   upon David's life (xviii. 10--11, 17--19); besides occasional details
   of less importance (xvii. 41, 50; xviii. 30).

   These omissions have been variously explained. According to Wellhausen
   and Kuenen [528] , the Greek translator, or the scribe of the archetype
   followed by Cod B, has deliberately removed the missing verses, from a
   desire to harmonise. Certainly the result of their absence is to
   reduce, if not altogether to remove, the conflict between c. xvi. 14
   ff., which represents David as an experienced warrior with whose
   reputation Saul is already acquainted, and cc. xvii., xviii., where on
   a later occasion he appears as a shepherd lad of whom the king has as
   yet heard nothing. But, as Robertson Smith has pointed out, it is
   difficult to believe that simple omissions made without changing a word
   of what was left could produce a complete and consecutive narrative
   such as we find in . He concludes that the verses omitted by are
   "interpolations in the Hebrew text, extracts from a lost biography of
   David . . . not found in the text which lay before the LXX. translators
   [529] ." Driver [530] doubts whether the verses can have been
   interpolated in a strict sense, "for an interpolation would not insert
   anything at variance with the narrative interpolated." "We seem
   therefore (he adds) shut up to the conclusion that the verses omitted
   in the Vat. MS. belong to an independent narrative, which was in parts
   incorporated with the older account, but not in all MSS. existing when
   the LXX. translated the book."

   The omissions are supplied in ^A, ^Luc., but probably from a
   non-Septuagintal source; the passages are marked with an asterisk in
   the Hexaplaric MSS. 64, 92 [531] .

   C. xxiii. 11--12. Here ^B omits by homoeoteleuton the Heb. from yrd (v.
   11) to ysgyrv (v. 12). But it also omits qylh vydv bly, (v. 11), and
   Wellhausen conjectures with probability that ei apokleisthesetai was
   wanting in the original form of the LXX. [532]


   1 KINGS (3 REGN.). In this book ^B contains a large quantity of
   additional matter, of varying character and worth [533] .

   C. ii. 35 a--n, 46 a--l, are summaries of Solomon's personal history,
   which have been attached, probably by the accidents of transcription,
   to the verses which they severally follow. On examination each of these
   passages proves to be made up partly of translations from verses which
   are not represented in the true LXX., partly of fragments of the LXX.
   which occur elsewhere in their true order, partly of brief descriptions
   gathered from other parts of the book.


   Thus ii. 35 a--b = iv. 25--26, c = iv. 31, d = v. 15, e = vii. 10 ff.,
   f--g = ix. 24--25 ( ), h = v. 16, i--k = x. 23 ff., l--o = ii. 8--9.
   Similarly, ii. 46 a = iv. 20 ( ), b = v. 2 ( ), c = iii. 1 ( ), d = ix.
   18 ( ), e = iv. 22--23, f = iv. 24, g = v. 5 ( ), h = 2 ff., i--k = x.
   29--30.


   C. viii. 53 a is an addition of quite another character and of the
   highest interest. The true LXX. ( ^B) omits viii. 12, 13, which in cod.
   A are thus supplied from Aquila [534] : tote eipen Salomon Kurios eipen
   tou skenosai en gnopho. oikodomesa oikon katoiketeriou soi, hedrsma tes
   kathedras sou aionos. But after v. 53 gives the substance of these
   words in a poetical form which is expressly attributed to an older
   source:

     tote elalesen S. huper tou oikou hos sunetelesen tou oikodomesai
     aupon Helion egnorisen (Luc., estesen) en ourano Kurios; | eipen tou
     katoikein ek gnophou (A, en gnopho); | oikodomeson oikon mou, oikon
     ekprepe (A, euprepe) sauto | tou katoikein epi kainotetos. | ouk
     idou haute gegraptai en biblio tes odes;

   Though this occurs in cod. A and Lucian, it was wanting in the Hebrew
   text which was before the translators of the second century A.D., for
   in the Hexapla it appeared only in the LXX. column [535] . But (as its
   very errors shew) it is a translation of a Hebrew original, and the
   biblio tes odes from which it came is doubtless none other than the
   Book of Jashar (sphrhysr, read as s hsyr?) [536] . Here has preserved
   for us a precious relic, which in has been first misplaced and then
   partly lost [537] .

   C. xii. 24 a--z. The longest interpolation in the book, partly similar
   to the Greek additions in c. ii., but presenting greater difficulties.
   After rehearsing the facts connected with the death of Solomon, and
   summarising the reign of Rehoboam, the interpolator tells the story of
   the rise of Jeroboam and the revolt of Israel, going over the ground
   already covered in cc. xi--xii., and anticipating c. xiv. ( ).


   The parallels are xii. 24 a = xi. 43, xiv. 21--22; b = xi. 26--28; c =
   xi. 40; d--f = xi. 43^b; xii. 2--5 ( ); g--n^a = xiv. 1--20 ( ); n^b--z
   = xii. 3--24.


   But the passage is no mere cento of verses to be found elsewhere either
   in or ; it is a second and distinct recension of the story, resting
   equally with the first upon a Hebrew original. So different and indeed
   in some respects contradictory are the accounts that they "cannot
   possibly have stood from the first in the same volume." The same action
   is ascribed in the one "to Shemaiah, at Shechem, in the days of
   Rehoboam"; and in the other "to Ahijah, at Jerusalem, in the days of
   Solomon [538] ." In fact, the present Greek version of 1 Kings has
   preserved two ancient accounts of the dismemberment of the Kingdom of
   David and Solomon, and though one of these survives also in there is no
   a priori ground for deciding which of the two is the more trustworthy.
   It is worthy of notice that cod. B omits the reference to Jeroboam's
   residence in Egypt in xii. 2, and the visit of Jeroboam's wife to
   Ahijah as it is told in c. xiv. 1--20, though it gives the two
   irreconcilable accounts of the meeting of Jeroboam with the prophet
   (xi. 29 ff., xii. 24 o). The whole of the narrative, so far as it
   exists only in the Greek, is omitted by A and the Syro-hexaplar, but it
   seems to have been retained by Lucian [539] .

   C. xvi. 28 a--h consists of another recension of the summary of
   Jehoshaphat's reign which occurs in c. xxii. 41--44, 47-50, where the
   last four verses are omitted altogether in ^B. Lucian, who agrees with
   ^B in the interpolation at xvi. 28, omits xxii. 40 b--52.


   2 KINGS (4 REGN.).

   C. i. 18 a--d. An addition similar in character to that which follows 3
   Regn. xvi. 28. The summary of Joram's reign has attached itself to the
   beginning as well as to the end of the story of Elijah's ascension,
   whilst in it finds a place only at the end (iii. 1--3). In this
   instance, however, ^A, Luc. agrees with ^B in repeating the summary,
   though with some variations. The student will find a comparison
   instructive.


   1 CHRONICLES i. 10--16, 17b--23 are wanting in ^B, which thus shortens
   the genealogy by omitting (1) the posterity of Ham, except the
   Cushites, (2) the longer of two lists of the posterity of Shem. Both
   passages are supplied (from Gen. x. 13--18, 22--29) by cod. A, in a
   version which came from Hexaplaric sources (see Field, i. p. 704).


   2 CHRONICLES xxxv. 19 a--d, xxxvi. 2 a--c, 5 a--d, are versions of 2
   Kings xxiii. 24--27, 31b--33, xxiv. 1--4, based apparently upon a
   recension of the Hebrew which differs from , and only in part
   assimilated to .


   2 ESDRAS xxi, xxii. (Neh. xi, xii.). The lists of princes and Levites
   are much shortened in ^B, which omits altogether xxi. 16, 20, 21, 28,
   29, 32--35; xxii. 4--6, 9, 15--21, 38, 40, 41.


   PSALMS.

   In many of the Psalms receive titles, or additions to their titles,
   which are wanting in . The following is a list of those which occur in

   cl. Hallelouia. As in cxlix.


   On the questions raised by the Greek titles see Neubauer in Studia
   Bibl. ii. p. 1 ff., Driver, Intr. p. 348 ff., the commentaries, e.g.
   those of Perowne, Kirkpatrick, and Cheyne, and the last-named author's
   Origin of the Psalter. Valuable traditions are probably embodied in the
   liturgical notes which assign certain Psalms to particular days of the
   week te mia sabbatou, deutera s., tetradi s. [540] , eis ten hemeran
   tou prosabbatou (cf. Mc. xv. 42)), and in those which attribute others
   to the time of the Return (Zachariou, Hangaiou) or to the Dispersion
   (en te diaspora). On the other hand some of the Greek titles appear to
   be fanciful (pro tou christhenai, pros ton Goliad), whilst others are
   obscure (ekstaseos, anast?seos).

   For the Christian (mystical) interpretation of the Greek titles see
   Athan. de titulis Psalmorum (Migne, P. G. xxvii. 591 sqq.), the
   variorum prolegomena in Pitra's Analecta sacra ii. p. 411 sqq., and
   Corderii exp. Patr. Gr. in Psalmos, passim.


   Ps. xiii. (xiv.) 3 a--c. This, the only long interpolation in the Greek
   Psalter, is found upon examination to be made up of Pss. v. 10 b,
   cxxxix. (cxl.) 4 b, ix. (x.) 17 a, Isa. lix. 7, 8, Ps. xxxv. (xxxvi.) 1
   a, all taken or abridged from the LXX. version with slight variations.
   That it never formed a part of the Hebrew Psalm may be safely affirmed,
   yet it is quoted continuously in Rom. iii. 13--18, where it follows
   without break upon an abridgement of Ps. xiii. (xiv.) 1--3.

   The Greek addition had a place in the koine, according to Jerome praef.
   in Isa.; cf. Field, ad loc. Whether it was brought into the text of the
   LXX. from the Epistle [541] , or was already in the Greek Psalm as
   known to St Paul, cannot perhaps now be ascertained. But it doubtless
   had its origin in the Rabbinical practice of stringing together
   passages excerpted from various books of the Old Testament (Sanday and
   Headlam on Romans, l.c.), and it may have existed under this form in a
   collection of testimonia used by the Apostle (on such collections see
   Hatch, Essays, p. 203, Westcott, Hebrews, p. 476 ff.).

   Ps. cli. psalmos idiographos) [542] . The MSS. of the LXX. contain
   after Ps. cl. a Psalm which bears the title Houtos ho psalmos
   id?ographos eis Daueid kai exothen tou arithmou, hote emonomachesen to
   Goliad, O. L. hic psalmus sibi proprie scriptus est David, extra
   numerum, cum pugnavit cum Golia[th]. The letter of Athanasius to
   Marcellinus, which is incorporated in cod. A, speaks freely of this
   Psalm as the work of David, and as Ps. cli. (§ 14 hoi men kaucheseos
   tes en Kurio apangellontes logous eisi kb' kai ks', le' . . . rna':
   § 25 to eklexameno kurio didous doxan psalle kai su ton rna' idion onta
   tou Daueid); and it is quoted as a Psalm of David by the author of the
   pseudonymous letter of Mary to Ignatius (cent. iv.; Lightfoot,
   Ignatius, iii. 144, phesin gar pou autos hoti Mikros emen, ktl.).
   Moreover the scribe of Cod. ' regarded it as a part of the Psalter, for
   his subscription runs . In cod. A, however, it is carefully excluded
   from the Psalter proper (subscr. ; and the judgement of the Laodicene
   canon (biblos psalmon hekaton pentekonta) is upheld by the title which
   in all the MSS. pronounces this 'autograph' (idiographos work of David
   to be exothen or ektos tou arithmou, i.e. ton rn' psalmon.


   This Psalm is clearly based on 1 Kings xvi. 7, 11, 26, 43, 51; 2 Kings
   vi. 5; 2 Chron. xxix. 26; Ps. lxxviii. 70, lxxxix. 20. Its resemblance
   to the LXX. of those passages is not so close as to suggest a Greek
   original, but on the other hand there is no evidence that it ever
   existed in Hebrew. Whether it had a Hebrew or a Greek original, it was
   probably added to the Greek Psalter after the translation of the fifth
   book was complete.


   For the literature of Ps. cli. see Fabricius-Harles, iii. p. 749, and
   Fabricius, Cod. pseudepigr. v. 7², p. 905 ff.


   THE ECCLESIASTICAL CANTICLES.

   In certain uncial MSS. and a large proportion of the cursives the
   Psalms are followed by a collection of liturgical odai (cantica). The
   following table shews the sources and order of those which are given by
   codd. A, R, T.

  A                             R                  T
  1. Exod. xv. 1--19.           Exod. xv. 1--21.
  2. Deut. xxxii. 1--43.        Deut. xxxii. 1--44.
  3. 1 Regn. ii. 1--10.         1 Regn. ii. 1--10.
  4. Isa. xxvi. 9--20.          Isa. v. 1V9.
  5. Ion. ii. 3--10.            Ion. ii. 3--10.
  6. Hab. iii. 1--19.           Hab. iii. 1--19.   [6] 1 Regn. ii. [1]--10.
  7. Isa. xxxviii. 10--20.      Magnificat.        7. Magnificat.

  9. Dan. iii. 26--45.                             9. Prayer of Manasseh [544] .
  10.   "  "    52--88.                            10. Dan. iii. 26--45.
  11. Magnificat.                                  11.   "  "      52--56.
  12. Nunc dimittis.                               12.   "  "      57--90.
  13. Benedictus.                                  13. Benedictus.
  14. Morning Hymn.                                14. Nunc dimittis.
                                                   15. Morning Hymn.


   The nine Odes now sung at Lauds in the Orthodox Church are (following
   the order of cod. A) nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 + 13; the Roman
   Church uses at Lauds on successive days of the week 10, Isa. xii., Isa.
   xxxviii. 10--20, 3, 1, 6, 2, whilst 13, 11, 12 are recited daily at
   Lauds, Vespers, and Compline respectively [545] . The Mozarabic
   Breviary, as printed, provides no fewer than 76 scriptural canticles.
   Little has been done as yet to examine either the Greek or the Latin
   Psalters with the view of determining the local distribution of these
   canticles; but the student may refer to art. Canticles in DCA., and
   also to Martene, de ant. rit. eccl., p. 25, Neale, Hist. of the H.
   Eastern Church, ii. p. 834 f., Freeman, Principles of Divine Service,
   i. p. 124 f.; on the Canticles of the Latin Church he may consult with
   advantage Thomasius, opp. ii. pp. xv. sqq., 295 sqq.

   The text of the O. T. canticles in the Psalter of cod. A differs in
   places from that which is given by the same MS. where the canticles
   appear with their context in the books to which they severally belong.
   Thus we find the following variants: Exod. xv. 14 orgisthesan cant.
   ephobethesan: Deut. xxxii. 7 geneon geneais cant. geneas geneon: 18
   gennesanta, cant. poiesanta: 1 Regn. ii. 10^a phronesei, cant. sophia:
   10^b akra ges, cant. + dikaios hon. But the deviations are not
   numerous, and the text of the canticles appears on the whole to belong
   to the same family as that of the body of the MS.


   The division of the Psalter into books [546] seems to have been already
   made when it was translated into Greek, for though the Greek codices
   have nothing to answer to the headings sphr r'svn, etc., which appear
   in the printed Hebrew Bible, the Doxologies at the end of the first
   four books appear in the Greek as well as in the M. T. (Ps. xl. (xli.)
   14, lxxi. (lxxii.) 18--20, lxxxviii. (lxxxix.) 5, cv. (cvi.) 48).


   PROVERBS. The variations of and in this book are treated by Lagarde in
   his early book Anmerkungen zur griech. Übersetzung der Proverbien.
   There is a considerable number of Greek verses for which offers no
   Hebrew equivalent, and there are some Hebrew verses or half-verses for
   which there is no Greek. Of the Greek verses not in some (e.g. iv.
   27a--b, vi. 8a--c) appear to be of Greek, perhaps early Christian,
   origin; others have been collected from various contexts (e.g. iii. 16
   = Isa. xlv. 23a + Prov. xxxi. 26; xxvi. 1 = Sir. iv. 21), or are
   fragments of the book which have been accidentally inserted twice (iii.
   22a = iii. 8, 28c = xxvii. 1); others, again, seem to have arisen from
   the fusion of two renderings (xv. 18a, xvi. 17); but there remain not a
   few which probably represent genuine portions of the original
   collections, though wanting in the present Hebrew text, e.g. vii. 1a,
   viii. 21a, ix. 12a--c, 18a--c, xii. 11 a, 13 a, xvii. 6 a, xviii. 22 a,
   xxii. 8 a (cited in 2 Cor. ix. 7), xxiv. 22a--e, xxvii. 20a, 21 a.


   JOB. The LXX. text of Job current in Origen's time is known to have
   been very much shorter than the Greek text preserved in extant MSS. and
   the M.T.


   Ad African. 4 pleista te hosa dia mesou holou tou Iob par Ebraiois men
   keitai par hemin de ouchi, kai pollakis men epe tessara e tria; esth'
   hote de kai dekatessara kai dekaennea kai dekaex (for. leg. ennea kai
   hex [547] ). Cf. Hieron. praef. in Hiob: "cui [sc. libro Iob], si ea
   quae sub asteriscis addita sunt subtraxeris, pars maxima voluminis
   detruncabitur, et hoc duntaxat apud Graecos. ceterum apud Latinos . . .
   septingenti ferme aut octingenti versus desunt."

   The asterisks are preserved in certain cursive MSS. of the Greek Job
   [548] and in MSS. of Jerome's version, while the shorter form is
   represented by the earliest form of the O.L. and in the Sahidic
   version. Most of the extant Greek MSS., including the best uncials,
   offer a text in which the lacunae are supplied (chiefly from
   Theodotion), but which still falls short of the fulness of the
   Hexaplaric LXX. and of [549] .


   Dr Hatch [550] in his Essay On Origen's revision of the LXX. text of
   Job advocates the theory that the LXX. represents a shorter Hebrew text
   which was afterwards expanded into the longer form. Bickell, in his
   early book De indole ac ratione versionis Alexandrinae (p. 42),
   maintained that the omissions were chiefly due to the translator, and
   this view is supported by recent critics. The evident desire of the
   translator to follow classical models suggests that he was an
   Alexandrian Hellenist [551] who intended his version for general
   reading, rather than for use in the synagogue [552] . Under such
   circumstances he may have been tempted to reduce the length of his
   original, especially in passages where it did not lend itself readily
   to his treatment. On the other hand he has not scrupled here and there
   to add to the original. Thus in c. ii. 9 he seeks to heighten the
   effect and at the same time to soften the harshness of the words
   uttered by Job's wife (chronou . . . pollou probebekotos . . . legon
   Idou anameno ktl.) [553] .


   The two notes at the end of the Greek Job (xlii. 17a, b--e) scarcely
   profess to belong to the book. The first (gegraptai de auton palin
   anastesesthai meth' hon ho kurios anistesin may be either a Pharisaic
   or a Christian gloss, intended to balance the eteleutesen Iob of the
   previous hemistich, and arising out of xix. 26 epi ges anastesai(v. l.
   anastesei) to derma mou to which passage gegraptai seems to refer. The
   second note, which professes to come from an Aramaic source houtos
   hermeneuetai ek tes Suriakes biblou [554] ), confuses Job ('yvv) with
   the Edomite king Jobab (yvvv) (Gen. xxxvi. 33 f. = 1 Chron. i. 44 f.),
   and bases on this identification a pedigree of the patriarch, according
   to which he was 'fifth from Abraham,' and a descendant of Esau. Similar
   statements occur in a fragment of the Hellenistic writer Aristeas
   quoted by Polyhistor, and from Polyhistor by Eusebius (praep. ev. ix.
   25). From a comparison of this extract with the note attached to Job,
   Freudenthal was led to ascribe the note to Aristeas [555] . Beyond the
   geographical description of Uz (epi tois horiois tes Idoumaias kai
   Arabias), and the statements that Job's wife was an Arab woman and that
   her son's name was Ennon or Enon (v. l.), the note contains nothing
   new: 17c--d rests upon Gen. xxxvi. 32--35 (LXX.), and 17 e on Job ii.
   11 (LXX.).


   ESTHER. In the Greek Esther we reach the maximum of interpolation. Of
   270 verses, 107 are wanting in the present Hebrew text, and probably at
   no time formed a part of the Hebrew book [556] . The Greek additions
   are distributed through the book in contexts as long as average
   chapters [557] . In the Latin Bible they are collected at the end of
   the canonical book, where they fill several consecutive chapters (x.
   4--xi. 5 = F, xi. 2--xii. 6 = A, xiii. 1--7 = B, xiii. 8--xiv. 19 = C,
   xv. 4--19 = D, xvi. 1--24 = E). This arrangement is due to Jerome, who
   relegated the Greek interpolations to the end of the canonical book;
   but it has had the effect of making them unintelligible. In their Greek
   sequence they form part of a consecutive history; A, which precedes c.
   i., introduces the story by describing the events which led to the
   first advancement of Mordecai at the court of Artaxerxes; B and E,
   which follow iii. 13 and viii. 12, profess to give copies of the
   letters of Artaxerxes referred to in those verses; C and D, which come
   between c. iv. and c. v., contain the prayers of Mordecai and Esther,
   and a description of Esther's approach to the King; F is an epilogue,
   which completes the story by relating the institution of the feast of
   Purim. Such Haggadic accretions will not create surprise if it be
   remembered that Esther was among the latest of the Kethubim, and that
   its canonicity was matter of dispute in Jewish circles even in the last
   years of the first century A.D. [558] .

   A note attached to the last of the Greek additions professes to relate
   the circumstances under which the book was brought to Egypt: "in the
   fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said
   that he was a priest and Levite, and his son Ptolemy, brought the above
   Letter of Purim [559] , as they called it, which had been translated
   (so they said) by one Lysimachus, son of Ptolemy, a resident at
   Jerusalem." As Fritzsche remarks [560] , no fewer than four Ptolemies
   married a Cleopatra (Epiphanes, Philometor, Physcon, and Lathyrus), so
   that the date intended by the fourth year of Ptolemy and Cleopatra is
   by no means certain, though it is perhaps most naturally interpreted as
   = B.C. 178--7 (? 166--5), the fourth year of Philometor [561] . But the
   historical value of the note is more than doubtful [562] .


   The Greek text of Esther exists in two recensions (1) that of 'ABN 55,
   93 b, 108 a, 249 al., (2) that of 19, 93 a, 108 b; both are exhibited
   by Ussher (Syntagma), Fritzsche (Esther, 1848; libri apocryphi, 1871),
   and Lagarde (libr. canon. V. T. i., 1883). The recensions differ
   considerably in the Greek additions as well as in the version. On the
   date of the Greek Esther the student may consult Jacob, Das Buch Esther
   bei dem LXX. in ZATW., 1890 (p. 241 ff.).


   JEREMIAH. Besides the extensive transpositions already noticed, the
   LXX. text of Jeremiah differs widely from M.T. in the way of excess and
   defect. The subject has received careful treatment from Dr A. W.
   Streane (Double Text of Jeremiah, Cambridge, 1896), whose verdict is on
   the whole in favour of the LXX. text, especially with regard to its
   omissions. He points out that "the tendency to diffuseness,
   characteristic of later Judaism . . . [and] likely specially to affect
   the writing of Jeremiah, as a prophet whose memory was of marked
   interest to the post-exilic Jews . . . operated much more slightly
   among Egyptian Jews than with their brethren elsewhere [563] "; and
   concludes that "the 'omissions' to be observed in the LXX. of Jeremiah,
   speaking generally, exist only in consequence of its nearer
   approximation to the original form of the Hebrew text."


   The Greek additions, in Jeremiah, rarely exceed a few words in a verse
   (see the list in Streane, p. 19). Omissions are more numerous, and
   sometimes extend over several consecutive verses of ; the following are
   the most noteworthy: viii. 10^b--12, x. 6, 8, 10, xvii. 1--5^a, xxix.
   (xxxvi., LXX.) 16--20, xxxiii. (xl., LXX.) 14--26, xxxix. (= xlvi.,
   LXX.) 4--13, lii. 28--30. Of these passages viii. l0^b--12 seems to be
   based on vi. 12--15, and xxix. 16--20 on xxiv. 8--10; x. 6, 8, 10,
   xxxix. 4-13 and lii. 28--30 are probably interpolations in the M.T. On
   the other hand it is possible that the omission of xvii. 1--l5^a was
   due to homoeoteleuton, the eye of the translator or the scribe of his
   archetype having passed from yhvh (xvi. 21) to yhvh (xvii. 5^a). It is
   more difficult to account for the absence from of the Messianic passage
   xxxiii. 14--26. Dr Streane thinks that it must have been wanting in the
   Hebrew text which lay before the translators. Possibly the Messianic
   hope which it emphasises had less interest for a subject of the
   Ptolemies than for the Jews of Palestine.


   LAMENTATIONS. The Greek translator has prefixed a heading which
   connects the book with Jeremiah (kai egeneto . . . ekathisen Ieremias
   klaion ktl.),


   DANIEL. Like Esther the Book of Daniel in both its Greek forms [564]
   contains large contexts which have no equivalent in . There are three
   such passages in the Greek Daniel: (1) the story of Susanna (Sousanna,
   Sosanna), which in the version of Theodotion [565] as given by the
   great uncials precedes Dan. i. 1; (2) the story of Bel and the Dragon
   (Bel kai Drakoe) which follows Dan. xii. 13; (3) after Dan. iii. 23 a
   digression of 67 verses (iii. 24--90, LXX., Th.), consisting of (a) the
   prayer of Azarias (24--45), (b) details as to the heating of the
   furnace and the preservation of Azarias and his friends (46--51), (c)
   the Song of the Three (52--90). In the Greek MSS. no break or separate
   title divides these Greek additions from the rest of the text, except
   that when Daniel is divided into "visions," the first vision is made to
   begin at i. 1, Susanna being thus excluded from the number; Bel, on the
   other hand, is treated as the last of the visions (horasis ib' AQ).
   Internal evidence appears to shew that both these stories originally
   had a separate circulation; Susanna does not form a suitable prologue
   to Dan. i. [566] , for v. 6 introduces Daniel as a person hitherto
   unknown to the reader; and the position of Bel as an epilogue to the
   prophetic portion of the book is still less appropriate. From the
   Fathers, however, it is clear that in the earliest Christian copies of
   the LXX. both Susanna and Bel formed a part of Daniel, to which they
   are ascribed by Irenaeus and Tertullian, and implicitly by Hippolytus.
   The remarkable letter of Julius Africanus to Origen which throws doubt
   on the genuineness of Susanna, calling attention to indications of its
   Greek origin, forms a solitary exception to the general view; even
   Origen labours to maintain their canonicity.


   Iren. iv. 26. 3 "et audient eas quae sunt a Daniele propheta voces"
   (Sus. 56, 52 f.), iv. 5. 2 "quem et Daniel propheta . . . annuntiavit"
   (Bel 4f., 25). Tert. de idololatria, 18 (Bel 4 f.). Hippol. in Sus.
   (Lagarde, p. 145) haute men oun he historia gegenetai husteron,
   proegraphe de tes biblou protes. Africanus, ep. ad Orig. thaumazo de
   tos elathe se to meros tou bibliou touto kibdelon on ktl. Orig. ad
   African. par amphoterois (LXX. and Theodotion) ekeito to peri ten
   Sosannan (hos su phes) plasma, kai hai teleutaiai en to Daniel
   perikopai. It will be noticed that the extracts from Hippolytus and
   Origen shew that Susanna and Bel occupied in MSS. of the second and
   third centuries the same relative positions which they occupy in extant
   MSS. of the fourth and fifth.


   Notwithstanding the objection shrewdly based by Africanus on the
   paronomasia (schinos, schizein) in Sus. 54 f., Ball (Speaker's Comm.,
   Apocrypha, ii. p. 330 f.) has given reasons for believing that both
   Susanna and Bel once existed in an Aramaic or a new-Hebrew original
   [567] . The LXX. version represents Bel as a fragment of Habakkuk (cod.
   87, Syro-Hex., tit. ek propheteias Hambakoum huiou Iesou ek tes phules
   Leui), an attribution evidently due to v. 33 ff., but inconsistent with
   the place of the story in the Gk. MSS.

   The addition to Dan. iii. 23 is clearly Midrashic and probably had a
   Semitic original [568] . The two hymns contained in it found a place,
   as we have seen, among the Greek ecclesiastical Canticles, where they
   appear as the proseuche Azariou and the humnos ton pateron hemon (cod.
   A) or hu. ton trion paidon (cod. T).

   Besides these additions, which are common to both texts of Daniel, the
   text of the LXX. contains a large number of shorter interpolations,
   especially in c. iii.--vi. where "the original thread of the narrative
   is often lost in a chaos of accretions, alterations, and displacements
   [569] ." The student can easily test this statement by comparing the
   two versions as they stand face to face in the Cambridge LXX.,
   especially in c. iii. i--3, 46, iv. 14 (17), 19 (22), 29--34 (32--37),
   v. 13--23, vi. 2--5 (3--6), 12--14 (13--15), 22 (23). But the whole of
   this section of the book in the LXX. may be regarded as a paraphrase
   rather than a translation of a Hebrew text. In Susanna Theodotion has
   here and there a much longer text than the LXX. (cf. Sus. 14--27,
   42--50), and both in Susanna and Bel the two Greek versions sometimes
   diverge so widely as to exhibit the story in distinct forms which
   appear to represent different traditions.

  CHAPTER III.

    BOOKS NOT INCLUDED IN THE HEBREW CANON.

   THE MSS. and many of the lists of the Greek Old Testament include
   certain books which find no place in the Hebrew Canon. The number of
   these books varies, as we have seen; but the fullest collections
   contain the following: 1 Esdras, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Sirach,
   Judith, Tobit, Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah, i.--iv. Maccabees.
   We may add the Psalms of Solomon, a book which was sometimes included
   in MSS. of the Salomonic books, or, in complete Bibles, at the end of
   the Canon; and the Greek version of Enoch, although by some accident it
   has been excluded from the Greek Bible, on other grounds claims the
   attention of every Biblical student. There is also a long list of
   pseudepigrapha and other apocrypha which lie outside both the Hebrew
   and the Greek Canons, and of which in many cases only the titles have
   survived. The present chapter will be occupied by a brief examination
   of these non-canonical writings of the Greek Old Testament.


   1. 1 ESDRAS. In MSS. of the LXX. the canonical book Ezra-Nehemiah
   appears under the title "Esdras b', Esdras a' being appropriated by
   another recension of the history of the Captivity and Return. The
   'Greek Esdras' consists of an independent and somewhat free version of
   portions of 2 Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah, broken by a long context
   which has no parallel in the Hebrew Bible.


   Thus 1 Esdr. i. = 2 Chron. xxxv. 1--xxxvi. 2l; ii. 1--14 = Ezra i.; ii.
   15--25 = Ezra iv. 7--24; iii. 1--v. 6 is original; v. 7--70 = Ezra ii.
   1--iv. 5; vi., vii. = Ezra v., vi.; viii. 1--ix. 36 = Ezra vii. 1--x.
   44; ix. 37--55 = Neh. vii. 73^b--viii. 13^a. The Greek book ends
   abruptly, in a manner which suggests that something has been lost; cf.
   ix. 55 kai episunechthesan with 2 Esdr. xviii. 13 sunechthesan hoi
   archontes ktl. The student may compare the ending of the Second Gospel
   (Mc. xvi. 8).


   The context 1 Esdr. iii. 1--v. 6 is perhaps the most interesting of the
   contributions made by the Greek Bible to the legendary history of the
   Captivity and Return. We owe to it the immortal proverb Magna est
   veritas et praevalet (iv. 41 [570] ), and the story which forms the
   setting of the proverb is worthy of the occasion. But in its present
   form it is certainly unhistorical; Zerubbabel (iv. 13) belonged to the
   age of Cyrus, and it was Cyrus and not Darius (iv. 47 f.) who decreed
   the rebuilding of Jerusalem. It has been suggested that "this story is
   perhaps the nucleus of the whole (book), round which the rest is
   grouped [571] ." In the grouping chronological order has been to some
   extent set aside; the displacement of Ezra iv. 7--24 (= 1 Esdr. ii.
   15--25) has thrown the sequence of events into confusion, and the scene
   is shifted from the court of Artaxerxes to that of Darius, and from
   Darius back again to Cyrus, with whose reign the history had started.
   Yet Josephus [572] , attracted perhaps by the superiority of the Greek
   style, uses 1 Esdras in preference to the Greek version of the
   canonical Ezra-Nehemiah, even embodying in his narrative the legend of
   Zerubbabel [573] . He evades the difficulty arising out of the
   premature reference to Artaxerxes by substituting Cambyses [574] . In
   the early Church the Greek Esdras was accepted without suspicion; cf.
   e.g. Clem. Alex. strom. i. 21; Origen, in Joann. t. vi. 1, in Jos. hom.
   ix. 10; Cyprian, ep. 74. 9. Jerome, however (praef. in Ezr.), discarded
   the book, and modern editions of the Vulgate relegate it to an appendix
   where it appears as 3 Esdras, the titles 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras being
   given to the two parts of the canonical book Ezra-Nehemiah [575] .

   The relation of the two Greek recensions of Ezra to one another is a
   problem analogous to that which is presented by the two 'versions' of
   Daniel, and scarcely less perplexing. It has been stated with great
   care in Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible (i. p. 759 ff.), by Mr H. St
   J. Thackeray. He distinguishes three views, (1) that 1 Esdras is a
   compilation from the LXX. version of 2 Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah,
   (2) that it is based on an earlier Greek version of those books, and
   (3) that it is an independent translation of an earlier Hebrew text;
   and while refusing to regard any solution as final, he inclines to the
   second. The third has recently found a champion in Sir H. H. Howorth
   [576] , who adds to it the suggestion that 1 Esdras is the true
   Septuagintal (i.e. the Alexandrian) version, whilst 2 Esdras is later,
   and probably that of Theodotion. Mr Thackeray is disposed to regard
   this contention as "so far correct that [1 Esdras] represents the first
   attempt to present the story of the Return in a Gr[eek] dress," 2
   Esdras being "a more accurate rendering of the Heb[rew]" which was
   "subsequently . . . required and . . . supplied by what is now called
   the LXX. version [577] ."


   2. WISDOM OF SOLOMON. The Greek title is Sophia Salomonos (Salomontos,
   Solomontos, Salomon). But the book was often cited as he Sophia, he
   panaretos Sophia, a name which it shared with Proverbs and
   Ecclesiasticus; see Lightfoot on Clem. 1 Cor. 55. In the Muratorian
   fragment it is described as "Sapientia ab amicis Salomonis in honorem
   ipsius scripta." The Latin versions and fathers called the book
   Sapienta or Sophia Salomonis (Cyprian, O. L.), but also simply liber
   Sapientiae (Lactantius, Vulg.).

   No other book in the Greek Bible is so manifestly Alexandrian in tone
   and style. Some early Christian writers attributed it to Philo (Hieron.
   praef. in libros Salomonis: "nonnulli scriptorum veterum hunc esse
   Iudaei Philonis affirmant"), and it has been ingeniously conjectured
   that this view found a place in the Greek archetype of the Muratorian
   fragment [578] . But though Wisdom has strong points of likeness to the
   works of Philo, it is free from the allegorizing spirit of that writer,
   and its conception of the Logos is less developed than his [579] . On
   the other hand it clearly belongs to a period when the Jewish scholars
   of Alexandria were abreast of the philosophic doctrines and the
   literary standards of their Greek contemporaries. The author is
   acquainted with the Platonic doctrine of the four cardinal virtues
   [580] (c. viii. 7 ei dikaiosunen agapa tis, hoi ponoi tautes eisin
   aretai; sophrosunen gar kai phronesin ekdidaskei, dikaiosunen kai
   andreian), and with the Platonic sense of hule (c. xi. 17 ktisasa ton
   kosmon ex amorphou hules; cf. Philo, de victim. 13, de mund. opif. 12).
   His ideas on the subject of preexistence (c. viii. 20), of the relation
   of the body to the spirit (c. ix. 15), of Wisdom as the soul of the
   world (vii. 24), are doubtless due to the same source. His language is
   no less distinctly shaped upon Greek models; "no existing work
   represents perhaps more completely the style of composition which would
   be produced by the sophistic school of rhetoric [581] ," as it existed
   under the conditions of Greek life at Alexandria. This remark may be
   illustrated by the peculiar vocabulary of the book. Unusual words
   abound, e.g. akelidotos, ambrosios, exallos, zotikos, iobolos,
   kakomochthos, kinetikos, krustalloeides, homoiopathes, pantepiskopos,
   polumeres, protoplastos; agerochia, apaugasma, aporroia, eidechtheia,
   energeia, eudraneia, rhembasmos, sullogismos; metakirnan, metalleuein,
   prouphestanai [582] . In some of these we can trace the influence of
   philosophical thought, in others the laboured effort of the writer to
   use words in harmony with the literary instincts of the age and place
   to which he belonged.

   The object of the book is to protect Hellenistic Jews from the
   insidious influences of surrounding ungodliness and idolatry, but while
   its tone is apologetic and even polemical, the point of view is one
   which would commend itself to non-Jewish readers. The philosophical
   tendencies and the literary style of Wisdom favour the view that it is
   earlier than Philo, but not earlier than the middle of the second
   century B.C. As to the author, the words in which Origen dismissed the
   question of the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews may be applied
   to this pre-Christian writing--tis de ho grapsas . . . to men alethes
   theos oiden. It is the solitary survival from the wreck of the earlier
   works of the philosophical school of Alexandria which culminated in
   Philo, the contemporary of our Lord.


   3. WISDOM OF JESUS, SON OF SIRACH. In cod. B the title of this book is
   simply Sophia Seirach [583] , but codd. AC give the fuller and more
   accurate form Sophia Iesou huiou Seirach (Cf. C. L. 27 paideian . . .
   echaraxa en to biblio touto Iesous huios Seirach [584] ). Jerome had
   seen a Hebrew Sirach which shared with the canonical book the title of
   Proverbs (praef. in libros Salom.: "Hebraicum reperi . . . Parabolas
   mslym praenotatum"). The later name, Ecclesiasticus, which appears in
   Cyprian (e.g. testim. ii. 1 "apud Salomonem . . . in Ecclesiastico"),
   marks the book as the most important or the most popular of the libri
   ecclesiastici--the books which the Church used for the purpose of
   instruction, although they were not included in the Jewish canon.


   Cf. Rufin. in symb. 38: "alii libri sunt qui non canonici sed
   ecclesiastici a maioribus appellati sunt, id est, Sapientia quae
   dicitur Salomonis, et alia Sapientia quae dicitur filii Sirach, qui
   liber apud Latinos hoc ipso generali vocabulo Ecclesiasticus
   appellatur, quo vocabulo non auctor libelli sed scripturae qualitas
   cognominata est."


   The Wisdom of the Son of Sirach was the work of a Palestinian (c. L. 27
   Iesous ho Ierosolumeites), and written in Hebrew; the Greek version was
   made by the grandson of the writer during a visit to Alexandria
   (prolog., ll. 5, 18 ff.). This visit is said to have begun en to ogdoo
   kai triakosto etei epi tou Euergetou basileos--words which, simple as
   they seem, are involved in a double ambiguity, since there were two
   Ptolemies who bore the name Euergetes, and it is not clear whether the
   38th year is to be reckoned from the commencement of the reign of
   Euergetes or from some other point of departure. But, assuming that the
   Euergetes intended is Euergetes II., i.e. Physcon [585] , and that the
   translator is counting from the time when Physcon was associated in the
   government with his brother and predecessor Philometor, we arrive at
   B.C. 132 as the terminus a quo of the Greek version, and the original
   may have been composed some fifty years earlier.

   Fragments of the original are preserved in Rabbinic literature. These
   are in the dialect of the Talmud; but recent discoveries have brought
   to light a large part of the book in classical Hebrew. A comparison of
   the Greek version with the Hebrew text, so far as it has been printed,
   reveals considerable differences, especially when the Greek text
   employed is that of cod. B, which was unfortunately chosen for the
   purpose by the Oxford editors of the Hebrew fragments. It must be
   remembered that these fragments come from a MS. of the 11th or 12th
   century, which may present a corrupt form of the Hebrew text; and on
   the other hand, that there are considerable variations in the Greek
   text of Sirach, cod. B differing widely from the majority of the MSS.
   [586] Much remains to be done before the text of Sirach can be settled
   with any confidence. Meanwhile Professor Margoliouth has thrown doubt
   upon the originality of the Hebrew fragments, which he regards as
   belonging to an eleventh century version made from the Syriac with the
   help of a Persian translation from the Greek [587] . At present few
   experts accept this theory, but the question must perhaps be regarded
   as sub iudice.

   In all the known MSS. of the Greek Sirach [588] , there is a remarkable
   disturbance of the sequence. They pass from c. xxx. 34 to c. xxxiii. 13
   b, returning to the omitted passage after xxxvi. 16 a. The error seems
   to have arisen from a transposition in the common archetype of the
   pairs of leaves on which these two nearly equal sections were severally
   written [589] --a fact which is specially instructive in view of the
   large divergences in the Greek MSS. to which reference has been made.
   The true order is preserved in the Old Latin [590] , Syriac, and
   Armenian versions.


   4. JUDITH (Ioudeith, -dith, -deth, = yhvdyt, cf. Gen. xxvi. 34, where
   the same spellings are found in the cursives, though the uncials
   exhibit Ioudein, Ioudin, an historical romance, of which the scene is
   laid in the days of Nebuchadnezzar (c. i. 2). The date of its
   composition is uncertain. A terminus ad quem is provided by the fact
   that Clement of Rome knew the story (1 Cor. 55 Ioudith he makaria . . .
   paredoken Kurios Olophernen en cheiri theleias) [591] ; and the name of
   Judith's enemy has suggested a terminus a quo, for Olophernes [592]
   appears to be a softened form of Orophernes, the name of a Cappadocian
   king, c. B.C. 158, who may have been regarded as an enemy of the Jews
   [593] . The religious attitude of the author of Judith is that of the
   devout Pharisee (cf. e.g. viii. 6, x. 2 ff., xi. 13, xii. 7), and the
   work may have been a fruit of the patriotic feeling called forth by the
   Maccabean wars.

   Origen's Jewish teachers knew nothing of a Semitic original (cf. ad
   African. 13: Ebraioi to Tobia ou chrontai oude te Ioudeth, oude gar
   echousin auta kai en apokruphois Ebraisti, hos ap' auton mathontes
   egnokamen). Jerome, on the other hand, not only says expressly (praef.
   in Iudith): "apud Hebraeos liber Iudith inter apocrypha (v.l.
   hagiographa) legitur," but he produced a version or paraphrase from an
   Aramaic source ("ea quae intellegentia integra ex verbis Chaldaeis
   invenire potui, Latinis expressi") [594] . The relation of this Aramaic
   text to the original of the Greek book remains uncertain.

   The Greek Judith is said by Fritzsche [595] to exist in three
   recensions: (1) that of the Uncials and the majority of the cursives,
   (2) that of codd. 19, 108, and (3) that which is represented by cod.
   58, and is in general agreement with the Old Latin and Syriac versions,
   which are based upon a Greek text.


   5. TOBIT (Tobeit (-bit, -bet), Tobeith, Tobias, liber Tobiae, utriusque
   Tobiae), a tale of family life, the scene of which is laid at Nineveh
   and Ecbatana, the hero being an Israelite of the tribe of Naphtali, who
   had been carried into captivity by Shalmanezer. The book appears to
   have been written for Jewish readers, and in Hebrew or Aramaic. The
   Jews of Origen's time, however, refused to recognise its authority
   (Orig. de orat. 14 te de tou Tobet biblo antilegousin hoi ek peritomes,
   hos me endiatheko), or even to include it among their apocrypha (see
   above, under JUDITH); but it was accepted by the Church (ep. ad
   African. 1. c. chrontai to Tobia hai ekklesiai), and there is abundant
   evidence of its popularity among Christians (cf. Ps. Clem. 2 Cor. 16.
   4, Polyc. ad Smyrn. 10. 2, Clem. Alex. strom. ii. 23, vi. 12, Orig. de
   orat. 11, in Rom. viii. 11, c. Cels. v. 19, Cypr. testim. iii. 1, 6,
   62). Gnostics shared this feeling with Catholics; the Ophites placed
   Tobit among their prophetical books (Iren. i. 30. 11).

   Jerome translated Tobit as he translated Judith, from a 'Chaldee,' i.e.
   Aramaic, copy, but with such haste that the whole was completed in a
   single day (praef. in Tob. "exigitis ut librum Chaldaeo sermone
   conscriptum ad latinum stylum tradam . . . feci satis desiderio vestro
   . . . et quia vicina est Chaldaeorum lingua sermoni Hebraico, utriusque
   linguae peritissimum loquacem reperiens unius diei laborem arripui, et
   quidquid ille mihi Hebraicis verbis expressit, hoc ego accito notario
   sermonibus Latinis exposui [596] "). Thus, as in the case of Judith, we
   have two Latin versions, the Old Latin, based upon the Greek, and
   Jerome's rough and ready version of the Aramaic.

   The Greek text itself exists in two principal recensions, represented
   by the two great uncials B and '. In c. vi. 9--xiii. 18 Fritzsche adds
   a third text supplied by the cursives 44, 106, 107 [597] . The relation
   of the two principal texts to each other has recently been discussed by
   Nestle (Septuagintastudien, iii.) and by J. Rendel Harris (in the
   American Journal of Theology, iii. p. 541 ff.). Both, though on
   different grounds, give preference to the text of '. Harris, however,
   points out that while ' is probably nearer to the original Hebrew, B
   may exhibit the more trustworthy text of the Alexandrian version of the
   book.


   6. BARUCH and THE EPISTLE OF JEREMIAH Barouch, Epistole Ieremiou,
   [prophetia] Baruch) were regarded by the Church as adjuncts of
   Jeremiah, much in the same way as Susanna and Bel were attached to
   Daniel. Baruch and the Epistle occur in lists which rigorously exclude
   the non-canonical books; they are cited as 'Jeremiah' (Iren. v. 35. 1,
   Tert. scorp. 8, Clem. Alex. paed i. 10, Cypr. testim. ii. 6); with
   Lamentations they form a kind of trilogy supplementary to the prophecy
   (Athan. ep. 39 Ieremias kai sun auto Barouch, Threnoi, Ipistole, Cyril.
   Hier. catech. iv. 33 Ieremiou meta Barouch kai Threnon kai Epistoles
   [598] ). In some Greek MSS. the Epistle follows Baruch without break,
   and in the Latin and English Bibles it forms the sixth and last chapter
   of that book.

   The Epistle (anrigraphon epistoles hes apesteilen Ieremias pros tous
   achthesomenous [v.1. apachthentas] aichmalotous eis Babulona) seems to
   have been suggested by Jer. xxxvi. (xxix.) 1 (cf. 2 Kings xxv. 20 ff.).
   It is generally recognised that this little work was written in Greek
   by a Hellenist who was perhaps anterior to the writer of 2 Maccabees
   (cf. 2 Macc. ii. 1 ff.) [599] .

   The problem presented by Baruch is less simple. This book is evidently
   a complex work consisting of two main sections (1. i.--iii. 8, iii.
   9--v. 9) [600] , each of which may be subdivided (i. 1--14, historical
   preface; i. 15--iii. 8, confession and prayer; iii. 9--iv. 4,
   exhortation; iv. 5--v. 9, encouragement). Of these subsections the
   first two shew traces of a Hebrew original; cf. e.g. i. 10 manna =
   mnchh ii. 3 anthropon = 'ys, iii. 4 ton tethnekoton = mty (for mty)
   [601] ; the third has been held [602] to rest on an Aramaic document,
   whilst the fourth is manifestly Hellenistic.

   An investigation by Professor Ryle and Dr James [603] into the relation
   between the Greek version of the Psalms of Solomon and the Greek
   Baruch, led them to the conclusion that Baruch was reduced to its
   present form after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus; and the tone
   of Bar. iv. 30 seems certainly to point to that period. On the other
   hand it is difficult to understand the unhesitating acceptance of the
   book by Christian writers from Athenagoras (suppl. 9) until the time of
   Jerome, and its practical inclusion in the canon, if the Greek version
   in its present form proceeded from a Palestinian Jew, and was the work
   of the last quarter of the first century A.D. [604] As to its use by
   the Jews there are contradictory statements in early Christian writers,
   for while the Apostolical Constitutions [605] inform us that the Jews
   read Baruch publicly on the Day of Atonement, Jerome says expressly
   that they neither read it nor had it in their possession, and his
   statement is confirmed by Epiphanius.

   7. BOOKS OF MACCABEES (Makkabaion a', b', g', d', Machabaeorum libri;
   ta Makkabaika, Hippol. in Dan. iv. 3; Orig. ap. Eus. H. E. vi. 25). The
   four books differ widely in origin, character, and literary value; the
   bond which unites them is merely their common connexion with the events
   of the age which produced the heroes of the Hasmonaean or Maccabean
   [606] family.


   1 MACCABEES. This book seems to have been used by Josephus (ant. xii.
   6. 1 sqq.), but it is doubtful whether he was acquainted with its Greek
   form. On the other hand, the Greek 1 Macc. was undoubtedly known to the
   Christian school of Alexandria; cf. Clem. Alex. strom. i. § 123 to ton
   Makkabaikon Origen ap. Eus. l.c. ta Makkabaika haper epigegraptai
   Sarbeth sabanaiel (v.l. S. sabane el). Whatever may be the meaning of
   this title [607] , it is clearly Semitic, and may be taken as evidence
   that the book was circulated in a Semitic original. Jerome appears to
   have seen a copy of this Hebrew or Aramaic text (prol. gal.
   "Maccabaeorum primum librum Hebraicum repperi"), but it has long
   disappeared [608] , and the book is now extant only in versions. The
   Latin and Syriac versions are based upon the Greek; the Old Latin
   exists in two recensions, one of which has taken its place in the Latin
   Bible, whilst the other is preserved in a St Germain's and a Madrid
   MS.; a Lyons MS. gives a text in which the two are mixed [609] .

   The history of 1 Macc. covers about 40 years (B.C. 175--132). There are
   indications that the writer was removed by at least a generation from
   the end of his period (cf. c. xiii. 30, xvi. 23 f.). He was doubtless a
   Palestinian Jew, but his work would soon have found its way to
   Alexandria, and if it had not already been translated into Greek, it
   doubtless received its Greek dress there shortly after its arrival.


   2 MACCABEES. The existence of a book bearing this title is implied by
   Hippolytus, who quotes 1 Macc. with the formula en te prote biblo ton
   Makkabaikon anagegraptai, and by Origen, if we may trust the Latin
   interpretation (in ep. ad Rom., t. viii. 1 "in primo libro Machabaeorum
   scriptum est"); the title itself occurs in Eus. praef. ev. viii. 9 (he
   deutera ton Makkabaion). But the evidence goes further back. Philo
   shews some knowledge of the book in Quod omnis probus liber, § 13, and
   the author of the Ep. to the Hebrews has a clear reminiscence of its
   Greek (Heb. xi. 31 alloi de etumpanisthesan ktl., cf. 2 Macc. vi. 19,
   30).

   The writer is described by Clement of Alexandria (strom. v. 14) as ho
   suntaxamenos ten ton Makkabaikon epitomen. This is precisely what he
   claims to do (c. ii. 23 hupo Iasonos tou Kurenaiou dedelomena dia pente
   biblion, peirasometha di henos suntagmatos epitemein). The work of the
   Cyrenian has perished, whilst the Alexandrian epitome survives. For
   Alexandrian the epitomist probably was; "the characteristics of the
   style and language are essentially Alexandrian . . . the form of the
   allusion to Jason shews clearly that the compiler was not his fellow
   countryman [610] ." "The style is extremely uneven; at times it is
   elaborately ornate (iii. 15--39, v. 20, vi. 12--16, 23--28, vii. &c.);
   and again, it is so rude and broken as to seem more like notes for an
   epitome than a finished composition" (xiii. 19--26); indeed it is
   difficult to believe that such a passage as the one last cited can have
   been intended to go forth in its present form. That the work never had
   a Semitic original was apparent to Jerome (prol. gal. "secundus Graecus
   est, quod ex ipsa quoque phrasei probari potest"). The vocabulary is
   extraordinarily rich in words of the later literary Greek, and the book
   betrays scarcely any disposition to Hebraise [611] .

   The second book of Maccabees presents a striking contrast to the first.
   Covering a part of the same period (B.C. 175--160), it deals with the
   events in a manner wholly different. In 1 Maccabees we have a plain and
   usually trustworthy history; in 2 Maccabees a partly independent but
   rhetorical and inaccurate and to some extent mythical panegyric of the
   patriotic revolt [612] .


   3 MACCABEES. A third book of Makkabaika finds a place in some Eastern
   lists (can. Apost., Niceph. stichom.). A Greek book under that title is
   found in codd. AV and a few cursives [613] . There is a Syriac version,
   but no Latin, nor is the book mentioned in any Western list, although
   the stichometry of Cod. Claromontanus implies a knowledge of its
   existence, for it mentions a fourth book. Similarly cod. ' passes from
   the first book to the fourth, whether the omission of the second and
   third is due to the deliberate judgement of the scribe or to his want
   of an archetype.

   A more exact description of 3 Maccabees would be that which it seems to
   have borne in some circles--the Ptolemaica [614] . The story belongs to
   the reign of Ptolemy Philopator (B.C. 222--205), and the scene is laid
   at Alexandria. The king, infuriated by the refusal of the Jerusalem
   priesthood to admit him to the Holy of Holies, returns to Egypt with
   the intention of avenging himself on the Alexandrian Jews; but by the
   interposition of Providence his plans are defeated, and he becomes,
   like Darius in Daniel and Artaxerxes in Esther, the patron of the
   people he had purposed to destroy.

   There are reasons for believing that this romance rests upon some
   historical basis. "The author . . . evidently has good knowledge of the
   king and his history . . . the feast kept by the Egyptian Jews at a
   fixed date [c. vii. 11] cannot be an invention . . . that Philopator in
   some way injured the condition of the Jews, and that they were
   concerned in the insurrection of the nation, seems very probable [615]
   ." Moreover Josephus has a somewhat similar tale drawn from another
   source, and connected with another reign [616] (c. Ap. ii. 5). The
   present book is doubtless Alexandrian, and of relatively late origin,
   as its inflated style, "loaded with rhetorical ornament [617] ,"
   sufficiently testifies. Some critics (Ewald, Hausrath, Reuss [618] )
   would place it in the reign of Caligula, but the knowledge of earlier,
   Alexandrian life which it displays points to an earlier date, perhaps
   the first century B.C. [619]


   4 MACCABEES. According to Eusebius and Jerome this book was the work of
   Josephus [620] ,


   Eus. H. E., iii. 10 peponetai de kai allo ouk agennes spoudasma to
   andri (sc. Iosepo) peri autokratpros logismou, ho tines Makkabaikon
   epegrapsan to tous agonas ton en tois houto kaloumenois Makkabaikois
   sungrammasin huper tes eis to theion eusebeias andrisamenon Ebraion
   periechein. Hieron. de virr. ill. 13 "alius quoque libro eius qui
   inscribitur peri autokratoros logismou valde elegans habetur, in quo et
   Maccabeorum digesta martyria" (cf. c. Pelag. ii. 5).


   The book is a philosophical treatise upon the question, ei autodespotos
   estin ton pathon ho eusebes logismos But the greater part of it [621]
   is occupied by a rhetorical panegyric upon the Jewish martyrs, Eleazar,
   and the seven brothers and their mother, who perished in the Maccabean
   troubles. This portion appears to be based on 2 Macc. vi. 18--vii. 42,
   which it amplifies with an extraordinary wealth of language and a
   terribly realistic picture of the martyrs' sufferings. The rhetoric of
   the writer, however, is subordinated to his passion for religious
   philosophy. In philosophy he is a pupil of the Stoics; like the author
   of the Wisdom of Solomon he holds fast by the doctrine of the four
   cardinal Virtues (i. 18 tes de sophias eideai kathistasin phronesis kai
   dikaiosune kai andria kai sophrosune and he sternly demands that the
   pathe shall be kept under restraint by the power of Reason. In religion
   he is a legalist with Pharisaic tendencies; he believes in future
   punishment (ix. 9, xiii. 15), in the eternal life which awaits the
   righteous (xv. 3, xvii. 5, xviii. 23), and in the atonement for sin
   which is made by voluntary sacrifice (vi. 29, xxii. 22).

   The style of 4 Macc. abounds in false ornament and laboured periods.
   But on the whole it is "truly Greek [622] ," and approaches nearer than
   that of any other book in the Greek Bible to the models of Hellenic
   philosophy and rhetoric. It does not, however, resemble the style of
   Josephus, and is more probably a product of Alexandrian Judaism during
   the century before the fall of Jerusalem.


   8. To the books of the Hebrew canon (ta endiatheka, ta eikosiduo) and
   the 'external' books (ta exo), which on the authority of Jerome the
   reformed Churches of the West have been accustomed to call the
   Apocrypha, some of the ancient lists add certain apocrypha properly so
   named. Thus the catalogue of the 'Sixty Books,' after reciting the
   canonical books of the O. and N. Testaments, and ta peri (leg. pera)
   touton exo (the two Wisdoms, 1--4 Maccabees, Esther, Judith, Tobit),
   continues: Kai hosa apokrupha; Adam, Henoch, Lamech, Patriarchai,
   Proseuche Ioseph, Eldad, Diatheke Mouseos, Analepsis Mouseos, Psalmoi
   Solomontos, Eliou apokalupsis, Esaiou horasis, Sophoniou apokalupsis,
   Zachariou apokalupsis, Esdra apokalupsis. The Pseudo-Athanasian
   Synopsis and the Stichometry of Nicephorus count among the apokrupha
   tes palaias, together with certain of the above, Abraam . . . Barouch,
   Habbakoum, Ezekiel, kai Daniel, pseudepigrapha [623] . Ebed Jesu
   mentions also a book called Traditions of the Elders, the History of
   Asenath, and even the Fables of Aesop disguised under the title
   Proverbs of Josephus. Besides these writings the following are censured
   in the Gelasian notitia librorum apocryphorum: Liber de filiabus Adae
   Leptogenesis, Poenitentia Adae, Liber de Vegia nomine gigante, qui post
   diluvium cum dracone . . . pugnasse perhibetur, Testamentum Iob,
   Poenitentia Iambre et Mambre, Solomonis interdictio.

   Though the great majority of these writings at one time existed in
   Greek, they were not admitted into collections of canonical books. A
   partial exception was made in favour of the PSALMS OF SOLOMON. This
   book is mentioned among the antilegomena of the O.T. in the Stichometry
   of Nicephorus and in the Pseudo-Athanasian Synopsis. An earlier
   authority, the compiler of the catalogue at the beginning of Codex
   Alexandrinus, allows it a place in his list, although after the final
   summary of the books of the Old and New Testaments [624] . If the Codex
   itself contained these Psalms, they have perished together with a
   portion of Ps. Clem. ad Cor. ii., the book which in the list
   immediately precedes them. It has been conjectured [625] that they once
   had a place in Cod. Sinaiticus, which like Cod. A has lost some leaves
   at the end of the N.T. Their absence from the other great uncials and
   from the earlier cursives may be due to the influence of the Laodicean
   canon (lix.), hoti ou dei idiotikous psalmous [626] legesthai en te
   ekklesia oude akanonista biblia, alla mona ta kanonika tes palaias kai
   kaines diathekes. Happily the Psalms survived in private collections,
   and find a place in a few relatively late cursives of the poetical and
   the Sapiential books of the O.T., where they follow the Davidic Psalter
   or take their place among the writings attributed to Solomon [627] .

   The Psalms of Solomon are shewn by their teaching and spirit to be the
   work of the Pharisaic school, and internal evidence connects them with
   the age of Pompey, whose death appears to be described in Ps. ii. 30
   ff. [628] The question of the date of the Greek version turns upon the
   nature of the relation which exists between the Greek Psalms and the
   Greek Book of Baruch. Bishop Ryle and Dr James, who regard Baruch iv.
   36--v. 9 (Greek) as based on the Greek of Ps. Sol. xi., are disposed to
   assign the version of the Psalms to the last decade of the first
   century B.C. [629] . They observe that the Messianic passages contain
   "no trace of Christian influence at work." On the other hand there are
   interesting coincidences between the Greek phraseology of the Psalter
   and that of the Magnificat and other Lucan canticles [630] .

   One other apocryphon of the Greek Old Testament claims attention here.
   The BOOK OF ENOCH has since 1838 been in the hands of scholars in the
   form of an Ethiopic version based upon the Greek. But until 1892 the
   Greek version was known only through a few fragments--the verse quoted
   by St Jude (cf. 14 f.), a brief tachygraphic extract in cod. Vat. gr.
   1809, published in facsimile by Mai (patr. nov. biblioth. ii.), and
   deciphered by Gildemeister (ZDMG., 1855, p. 622 ff.), and the excerpts
   in the Chronographia of Georgius Syncellus [631] . But in 1886 a small
   vellum book was found in a Christian grave in Akhmîm (Panopolis), in
   Upper Egypt, ee which contained inter alia the first thirty-two
   chapters of Enoch in Greek--nearly the whole of the first section of
   the book. This large fragment was published by M. Bouriant in the ninth
   volume of Mémoires publiés par les membres de la mission archéologique
   Française au Caire (Paris, 1^er fasc. 1892; 3^e fasc. 1893).

   The newly recovered Greek belongs to the oldest part of Enoch, which
   may be regarded as in the main a Palestinian work of the second century
   B.C. [632] . The Greek version is the parent of the Ethiopic, and of
   pre-Christian date, since it was in the hands of St Jude. Thus it
   possesses a strong claim upon the attention of the student of Biblical
   Greek, while the book itself possesses an almost unique value as an
   exposition of Jewish eschatology.

   The Greek version of Enoch seems to have been circulated in the ancient
   Church; cf. Barn. 4. 16; Clem. Alex. ecl. proph. 2; Orig. de princ. i.
   3. 3, iv. 35, hom. in Num. 28. 2. The book was not accepted by
   authority (Orig. c. Cels. v. 54 en ta?s ekklesiais ou panu pheretai hos
   theia ta epigegrammena tou Henoch biblia: in Ioann. t. vi. 25 ei to
   philon paradechesthai hos hagion to biblia. Hieron. de virr. ill. 4
   "apocryphus est"), but opinion was divided, and Tertullian was prepared
   to admit the claims of a writing which had been quoted in a Catholic
   Epistle (de cult. faem. i. 3 "scio scripturam Enoch . . . non recipi a
   quibusdam quia nec in armarium Iudaicum admittitur . . . a nobis quidem
   nihil omnino reiciendum est quod pertineat ad nos . . . eo accedit quod
   E. apud Iudam apostolum testimonium possidet)." In the end, however, it
   appears to have been discredited both in East and West, and, if we may
   judge by the almost total disappearance of the Greek version, it was
   rarely copied by Catholics even for private study. A mere chance has
   thrown into our hands an excerpt made in the eighth or ninth century,
   and it is significant that in the Akhmîm book Enoch is found in company
   with fragments of a pseudonymous Gospel and Apocalypse [633] .

  CHAPTER IV.

    THE GREEK OF THE SEPTUAGINT.

   1. No thorough treatment of the Greek idiom of the LXX. is known to
   exist. Two ancient treatises upon the dialect of Alexandria, by
   Irenaeus (Minutius Pacatus) and Demetrius Ixion [636] , have unhappily
   disappeared. In modern times the ground has been broken by Sturz and
   Thiersch [637] , and within the last few years Deissmann [638] has used
   the recently discovered papyri of Egypt to illustrate the connotation
   or the form of a number of Septuagint nouns and verbs. Much has also
   been done by Dr H. A. A. Kennedy [639] and the Abbé J. Viteau [640] in
   the way of determining the relation of Septuagint Greek to the
   classical and later usage, and to the Greek of the N.T.; and the N.T.
   grammars of Winer-Moulton, Winer-Schmiedel, and Blass contain
   incidental references to the linguistic characteristics of the
   Alexandrian version. But a separate grammar of the Greek Old Testament
   was long a real want, and the time has now come for attempting to
   supply it. Biblical scholars have now at their disposal a store of
   trustworthy materials in the Oxford Concordance, and the larger
   Cambridge Septuagint will supply an accurate and sufficient textual
   guide. On the basis of these two works it ought to be possible for the
   workers of the twentieth century to prepare a satisfactory grammar and
   lexicon [641] . Meanwhile in this chapter nothing more can be attempted
   than to set before the beginner some of the linguistic problems
   presented by the Greek of the Septuagint, and to point out the chief
   features which distinguish it from other forms of the language.


   2. The student who enters upon this subject with some knowledge of the
   Greek New Testament must begin by reminding himself of the different
   conditions under which the two parts of the Greek Bible were produced.
   The Greek Old Testament was not like the New Testament the work of a
   single generation, nor are its books as homogeneous in their general
   character. The Septuagint is a collection of translations interspersed
   with original Greek works, the translations belonging partly to the
   third century B.C., partly to the second and first, and the original
   works chiefly to the end of this period. Even in the case of the
   Pentateuch we are not at liberty to assume that the translators worked
   at the same time or under the same circumstances. These considerations
   complicate our enquiry, and lead us to expect in the LXX., great
   varieties of manner and language. In the earlier work we shall meet
   with the colloquial Greek which the Jews learnt to speak shortly after
   their settlement in Egypt. Later translations will approximate to the
   literary style of the second century, except in cases where this
   tendency has been kept in check by a desire to follow the manner of the
   older books. Lastly, in the original writings, many of which are
   relatively late, and in which the writers were free from the
   limitations that beset the translator, the Greek will be nearly
   identical with that which was written by the Jewish-Alexandrian
   historians and philosophers of the time.


   3. We begin by investigating the literary conditions under which both
   the translators and the writers lived at Alexandria.

   In the middle of the second century B.C. Polybius [642] found
   Alexandria inhabited by three races, the native Egyptians, who occupied
   the site of the old seaport Rhacôtis, the mercenary class (to
   misthophorikon), who may be roughly identified with the Jews, and the
   Greeks of the Brucheion, a mixed multitude claiming Hellenic descent
   and wedded to Hellenic traditions (ei migades, Hellenes homou anekathen
   esan, kai ememnento tou koinou ton Hellenon ethous). This fusion of
   various elements in the Greek population of the city must have existed
   from the first. The original colony was largely made up of the veterans
   of Alexander's Macedonian army, volunteers from every part of Greece,
   and mercenaries from the Greek colonies of Asia Minor, and from Syria.
   Even in the villages of the Fayûm, as we now know, by the side of the
   Macedonians there were settlers from Libya, Caria, Thrace, Illyria, and
   even Italy [643] , and Alexandria presented without doubt a similar
   medley of Hellenic types. Each class brought with it a dialect or idiom
   of its own. The Macedonian dialect, e.g., is said to have been marked
   by certain phonetic changes [644] , and the use of barbarous terms such
   as ade = ouranos, bethu [645] = aer, danos = thanatos and of Greek
   words in unusual senses, as parembole, 'camp,' rhume, street [646] .
   Some of these passed into the speech of Alexandria, and with them were
   echoes of the older dialects--Doric, Ionic, Aeolic--and other less
   known local varieties of Greek. A mongrel patois, he Alexandreon
   dialektos, as it was called in the title of the treatise of Demetrius
   Ixion, arose out of this confusion of tongues.

   No monument of the Alexandrian 'dialect' remains, unless we may seek it
   in the earlier books of the Alexandrian Greek Bible. We have indeed
   another source from which light is thrown on the popular Greek of Egypt
   under the earlier Ptolemies. A series of epistolary and testamentary
   papyri has recently been recovered from the Fayûm, and given to the
   world under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy [647] ; similar
   collections have been published by Drs Grenfell and Hunt [648] . The
   Greek of these documents is singularly free from dialectic forms, owing
   perhaps to local circumstances, as Professor Mahaffy suggests; but the
   vocabulary has, in common with the LXX., many striking words and forms,
   some of which are rare elsewhere.


   The following list has been formed from the indices to the Flinders
   Petrie collection: anadendras, anaphalakros, anaphalantos,
   archisomatophulax, architektonein, achuron, basilissa, genema, diorux,
   epigone, ergodioktes, euilatos, ephidein, ephiorkein, theristron,
   oligopsuchein, ochuroma, opsonion, paidion, paradeixai, parepidemos,
   peridexion, periodeuein, praktor, presbuteroi, stenochorein, choma. The
   Berlin papyri yield many other such words, e.g. anametresis, glumma,
   dikaioma, hieropsaltes, himatismos, katalochismos, ktenotrophos,
   misoponeria, holoscheres, sumplerosis, hupomnematismos.

   The following letter of the time of Philadelphus will serve to shew the
   style of these documents, and at the same time the use in them of
   certain Septuagint words. It is addressed by the foremen (dekatarchoi)
   of a gang engaged in a stone quarry to the engineer of the works
   (architekton):

   Kleoni chairein. hoi dekatarchoi ton eleuther[on] latomon adikoumetha;
   ta gar homologethenta hupo Apolloniou tou dioiketou outhen ginetai
   hemin, echei de ten graphen Diotimos. spoudason oun hina katha
   exeilephamen ede, hupo Dionusiou kai Diotimou chrematisthe hemin, kai
   me ta erga enleiphthe, katha kai emprosthen egeneto. ean gar aisthontai
   hoi ergazomenoi outhen hemas eilephotas ton sideron enechura thesousin.
   [649]


   4. Simultaneously with the growth of the colloquial mixed dialect, a
   deliberate attempt was made at Alexandria to revive the glories of
   classical Greek. The first Ptolemy, who had been the companion of
   Alexander's early days, retained throughout his life a passion for
   literature and learning. Prompted, perhaps, by Demetrius of Phalerum,
   Soter founded at Alexandria the famous Museum, with its cloisters and
   lecture rooms and dining hall where scholars lived a common life under
   a warden appointed by the King [650] . To Soter is also attributed the
   establishment of the great library which is said to have contained
   400,000 MSS [651] . Under his successor the Museum and Library became a
   centre of literary activity, and the age to which the inception of the
   Greek Bible is usually ascribed produced Aratus, Callimachus, Herondas,
   Lycophron, and Theocritus. There is however no reason to suppose that
   the Jewish translators were officially connected with the Museum, or
   that the classical revival under Soter and Philadelphus affected them
   directly. Such traces of a literary style as we find in the Greek
   Pentateuch are probably due not to the influence of the scholars of the
   Royal Library, but to the traditions of Greek writing which had floated
   down from the classical period and were already shaping themselves
   under altered conditions into a type of Greek which became the common
   property of the new Hellenism.


   5. The later Greek, the koine or Hellenike dialektos--the dialect in
   general use among Greek-speaking peoples from the fourth century
   onwards [652] --was based on Attic Greek, but embraced elements drawn
   from all Hellenic dialects. It was the literary language of the
   cosmopolitan Hellas created by the genius of Alexander. The change had
   begun indeed before Alexander. Even Xenophon allows himself to make
   free use of words of provincial origin, and to employ Attic words with
   a new connotation; and the writings of Aristotle mark the opening of a
   new era in the history of the Greek language [653] . But the golden age
   of the koine begins in the second century with Polybius (c. B.C. 145),
   and extends a century or two beyond the Christian era, producing such
   writers as Diodorus Siculus (B.C. 40), Strabo (A.D. 10), Plutarch (A.D.
   90), and Pausanias (A.D. 160). The language used by the writers of the
   Greek Diaspora may be regarded as belonging to a subsection of an early
   stage of the koine, although, since the time of Scaliger, it has been
   distinguished from the latter by the term 'Hellenistic [654] .' A
   'Hellenist [655] ' is properly a foreigner who affects Greek manners
   and speaks the Greek tongue. Thus the Jewish Greek spoken in Palestine
   was 'Hellenistic' in the strictest sense. The word is often used to
   describe the Greek of such thoroughly Hellenised writers as Philo and
   Josephus, and the post-apostolic teachers of the ancient Church; but it
   is applied with special appropriateness to the Alexandrian Bible and
   the writings of the New Testament, which approach most nearly to the
   colloquial Greek of Alexandria and Palestine.


   6. Such were the local types of Greek upon which the Jewish translators
   of the O.T. would naturally mould their work. While the colloquial
   Greek of Alexandria was their chief resource, they were also
   influenced, in a less degree, by the rise of the later literary style
   which was afterwards known as the koine.

   We are now prepared to begin our examination of the vocabulary and
   grammar of the Alexandrian Bible, and we may commence by testing the
   vocabulary in the translated books. Let us select for this purpose the
   first three chapters of Exodus, 1 Kingdoms, 2 Chronicles, Proverbs, and
   Jeremiah, books which are, perhaps, fairly representative of the
   translation as a whole. Reading these contexts in the Cambridge manual
   edition, and underlining words which are not to be found in the Greek
   prose of the best period, we obtain the following results. In Exod.
   i.--iii. there are 19 such words; in 1 Regn. i.--iii., 39; in 2 Chron.
   i.--iii., 27; in Prov. i.--iii., 16; in Jer. i.--iii., 34; making a
   total of 135 later words in 15 chapters, or nine to a chapter. Of these
   words 52--considerably more than a third--appear to be peculiar to the
   LXX., or to have been used there for the first time in extant
   literature.


   The following are the Septuagintal words observed in the above-named
   passages. Verbs: andrioun, deuteroun, diodeuein, eneulogeisthai,
   exolethreuein, exouthenei [656] , euodoun, katakleronomein,
   kataskopeuein, katemblepein, katodunan, olethreuein, orthotomein,
   orthrizein, pneumatophoreisthai, ptochizein, skopeuein, sunedriazein,
   trietizein, tropheuein, philechthran. Nouns: agape, asunthesia,
   asphaltopissa, bdelugma, genema, doma, ergodioktes, thlimmos,
   katapetasma, krima, latomos, methusma, holokautoma, holokautosis,
   orophoma, pantokrator, pros?lutos proskomma, rhoiskos, suntrimma.
   Foreign words (a) with Greek terminations: habra, thibis, siklos; (b)
   transliterated: ailam, dabeir, ephoud bar, nebel, eloe sabaoth, oiphi,
   sersereth, cheroubeim.


   A similar experiment has been made by Dr H. A. A. Kennedy in reference
   to one of the books of the Pentateuch. Of 110 late words and forms
   observed in Deut. i.--x. he found that 66 belonged to Biblical Greek,
   16 of these being peculiar to the LXX.; of 313 such words in the entire
   book, 152 proved to be Biblical, and 36 peculiar to the Old Testament;
   nearly half belonged to the koine, and more than a fourth had been used
   by the writers of tragedy and comedy.

   A complete list of the late words in the LXX. is still desideratum.
   Lists which have been made for the N.T. shew that out of 950
   post-Aristotelian words about 314--just under one third--occur also in
   the Greek O.T. [657] But the writers of the N.T. have taken over only a
   part--perhaps a relatively small part--of the vocabulary of the LXX. As
   Dr T. K. Abbott has pointed out [658] , Psalm l. (li.) alone yields
   four important words (agathunein, akoutizein, anomema, antanairein)
   which find no place in the N.T. This fact is suggestive, for the Psalm
   is doctrinally important, and the words are such as would have lent
   themselves readily to N.T. use.


   The following LXX. words are condemned by Phrynichus as non-Attic:
   aichmalotizesthai, apotassesthai, basilissa, bounos, brechein (in the
   sense of huein), gregorein, eleusesthai, exadelphos, katorthoma,
   megistan, methusos, oikodome, paidiske, papuros, parembole,
   pepoithesis, plexai, rhapisma, rhume, skorpizesthai, sussemon. Some of
   these words are said to be provincialisms; e.g. bounos is Sicilian,
   skorpizesthai is Ionic, parembole and rhume are Macedonian [659] .

   As our knowledge of Alexandrian Greek increases, it may be that the
   greater part of the words which have been regarded as peculiar to the
   LXX. will prove to belong to the usage of Egyptian Greek. Deissmann has
   already shewn that many well-known Septuagintal words find a place in
   the Greek papyri of the Ptolemaic period, and therefore presumably
   belonged to the language of business and conversation at Alexandria.
   Thus gonguzein occurs in a papyrus of 241--239 B.C.; ergodioktes, 255
   B.C.; parepidemos, 225 B.C.; forms such as eltha, epelthosan, gegonan,
   oides, can be quoted from the papyri passim; anastrephesthai and
   anastrophe in an ethical sense, ?eitourgein in reference to the service
   of a deity, peritemnesthai of circumcision, presbuteros of an official,
   are shewn to have been in use in Egypt under the Ptolemies. In many
   cases however words receive a new connotation, when they pass into
   Biblical Greek and come into contact with Hebrew associations. As
   examples the following may suffice: angelos, grammateus, diabolos,
   eidolon, ethne, ekklesia, pantokrator, pentekoste, proselutos,
   christos.

   The forms of many words have undergone a change since the age of
   classical Greek. A few specimens may be given from the pages of
   Phrynichus:

   Attic Greek.  Greek of the LXX. Attic Greek.  Greek of the LXX.
   apokrinasthai apokrithenai      miaros        mieros
   apheileto     apheilato         mochlos       moklos (MSS.)
   achri, mechri achris, mechris   neossos, -sia nossos, -sia
   genesthai     genethenai        noumenia      neomenia
   glossokomeion glossokomon       orthrios      orthrinos
   dipsen        dipsan            oudeis        outheis [660]
   duoin         dusi              peinen        peinan
   edeito        edeeto            pecheon       pechon
   heurema       heurema           podapos       potapos
   katha         kathos            tachuteron    tachion
   katamuein     kammuein


   7. But the vocabulary of the LXX. is not its most characteristic
   feature. With no other vocabulary than that of the Alexandrian
   translators, it might be possible to produce a fairly good piece of
   Greek prose in the style of the later prose writers. It is in its
   manner, in the construction of the sentences and the disposition of the
   words, that the Greek of the LXX. is unique, and not only or chiefly in
   its lexical eccentricities. This may perhaps be brought home to the
   student most effectually by a comparison of the Greek Bible with two
   great Hellenistic writers of the first century A.D. (a) In the works of
   Philo we have a cultured Hellenist's commentary on the earlier books of
   the LXX., and as he quotes his text verbatim, the student can discern
   at a glance the gulf which divides its simple manner, half Semitic,
   half colloquial, from the easy command of idiomatic Greek manifested by
   the Alexandrian exegete. We will give two brief specimens.

   (b) Josephus is not a commentator, but a historian who uses the LXX. as
   an authority, and states the facts in his own words. We will contrast a
   few passages of the Greek Bible with the corresponding contexts in the
   Antiquities.

   apolesantas to andras einai, to Babulonio douleusontas basilei.


   Josephus, it will be seen, has rewritten each passage, and in doing so,
   has not only modified the vocabulary, but revolutionised the style. On
   turning from the left hand to the right hand column we pass from a
   literal translation of Semitic texts to an imitation of classical
   Greek. But the contrast is not entirely due to the circumstance that
   the passages taken from the Septuagint are translations, while the
   Antiquities is an original work. Translations, however faithful, may be
   in the manner of the language into which they render their original.
   But the manner of the LXX. is not Greek, and does not even aim at being
   so. It is that of a book written by men of Semitic descent, who have
   carried their habits of thought into their adopted tongue. The
   translators write Greek largely as they doubtless spoke it; they
   possess a plentiful vocabulary and are at no loss for a word, but they
   are almost indifferent to idiom, and seem to have no sense of rhythm.
   Hebrew constructions and Semitic arrangements of the words are at times
   employed, even when not directly suggested by the original. These
   remarks apply especially to the earlier books, but they are true to a
   great extent in regard to the translations of the second century; the
   manner of the older translations naturally became a standard to which
   later translators thought it right to conform themselves. Thus the
   grandson of Jesus son of Sirach writes his prologue in the literary
   style of the Alexandrian Jews of the time of Euergetes, but in the body
   of the work he drops into the Biblical manner, and his translation
   differs little in general character from that of the Greek version of
   Proverbs.


   8. From the general view of the subject we proceed to a detailed
   account of some of the more characteristic features of the language of
   the LXX. They fall under three heads--orthography, accidence, syntax.
   Under the second head a full list of examples from the Pentateuch will
   be given, with the view of familiarising the beginner with the
   vocabulary of the earlier books.


   I. ORTHOGRAPHY.


   In the best MSS. of the LXX. as of the N.T. a large number of peculiar
   spellings occur, of which only a part can be assigned to itacism and
   other forms of clerical error. In many of the instances where the great
   uncial MSS. of the Greek Bible persistently depart from the ordinary
   orthography they have the support of inscriptions contemporary with the
   translators, and it is manifest that we have before us specimens of a
   system which was prevalent at Alexandria [661] and other centres of
   Greek life [662] during the third and second centuries before Christ.

   To a considerable extent the orthography of the MSS. is the same in the
   LXX. and the N.T. The student may find ample information with regard to
   the N.T. in the Notes on Orthography appended to Westcott and Hort's
   Introduction, and in the best N. T. grammars (Ph. Buttmann,
   Winer-Moulton, Winer-Schmiedel, Blass). But even in MSS. which like
   'BAC originally contained the whole of the Greek Scriptures, the Greek
   Old Testament possesses an orthography which is in part peculiar to
   itself, and certain features which are common to both Old and New
   Testaments are found with greater frequency and with a wider
   application in the LXX. than in the N.T. The reader of the Cambridge
   manual LXX. who is interested in this question, can readily work out
   the details from the apparatus criticus, and more especially from the
   appendix, where he will find all the spellings of the uncial MSS.
   employed which were not thought worthy of a place in the footnotes to
   the text. For those to whom orthography is of little interest the
   specimens given below will probably suffice.


   Consonants. Assimilation neglected in compounds: engastrimuthos,
   sunkatakleronomein, sunseismos, enkainia, encheiridion. Assimilation
   where there is no composition: em meso, eg gastri. Use of n
   ephelkustikon before consonants (omission is rare, except in a few
   cases such as pasi before the art.); use of the final s in achris,
   mechris, houtos, antikrus. Retention of the m in fut. and aor. pass. of
   lambanein (lempsomai, elemphthen), and in words formed from it, e.g.
   proslempsis. Outheis, metheis (see p. 297, note) for oudeis, medeis. G
   dropped in the middle of a word between vowels, as kraue, olios,
   pheuein (especially in cod. '). Rh not doubled in compounds, e.g.
   epirantizein, koloboris, kataraktos, and reduplicated in the augment
   (rherantismenos); ss for tt in elasson, hesson, arsen, tharsein. In
   some verbal forms consonants are doubled, e.g. bennein, ktennein,
   chunnein. Rough and smooth consonants are occasionally exchanged, e.g.
   kuthra (1 Regn. ii. 14, B) for chutra.

   Vowels. Ei for i in syllables where i is long, e.g. Semitic words such
   as Leuei, Leueites, Daueid, Seion, and Greek words as trapezeites,
   geinesthai, geinoskein. Also (perhaps by itacism) in innumerable
   instances of ? [663] ; e.g. horeion, aletheinos, adikeia, kreinein. I
   for ei, e.g. tichos, litourgein, aliphein, alimma, kateliphthen,
   paradigma, danizein, ophiletes, aigios, and esp. in nouns in -eia,
   -eia, e.g. apolia, endia, paidia, Samaria, stratia, and those in eion,
   as danion, eidolion. A for e, as eraunan; e for a, as ekatheristhen,
   mieros, tesserakonta. Omission of a syllable consisting of i, as in
   pein, tameion. Prefixing of a vowel, as in echthes.

   Breathings. Rough breathing for smooth: e.g. ouch holigos, eph'
   helpidi, ephide, ouch heisakousomai (Jer. vii. 16), kath' hophthalmous
   (Ezech. xx. 14). Similarly we find halsos, halopex, heniautos Dt. xiv.
   20 (Nestle, Septuagintastudien i. p. 19, ii. pp. 12, 13, 20 f.). Smooth
   breathing for rough: ouk eneken (2 Regn. vii. 12), ouk uparchei (Job
   xxxviii. 26, A).


   Abnormal spellings such as these occur on every page of an uncial MS.
   of the LXX. and sometimes cause great perplexity to an editor of the
   text. So far as they correctly represent the written or spoken Greek of
   the period, their retention is, generally speaking, desirable. In some
   cases the MSS. are unanimous, or each MS. is fairly persistent in its
   practice; in others, the spelling fluctuates considerably. The
   Cambridge manual LXX. usually adopts a spelling which is persistently
   given by the MS. whose text it prints, and on the same principle
   follows the fluctuations of its MS. where they are of any special
   interest. But the whole question of orthography is far from having
   reached a settlement.

   archidesmophulax, archidesmotes, archiereus, archimageiros,
   archioinochoos, archisitopoios, epipemptos, euprosopos, kataloipos,
   kataxeros, paralios, parepidemos, peridexion, perilupos, perioikos,

   Compounded with a verb stem, and forming a fresh noun or a verb:
   anemophthoros, glossotmetos, ergodioktes, thanatephoros, therialotos,
   therobrotos, hippodromos, ischnophonos, ktenotrophos, numphagogos,
   sitopoios, sphurokopos, telesphoros, charopoios, dichotomein,
   zoogonein, klopophorein, kreanomein, lithobolein, limanchonein,
   neurokopein, ornithoskopein, sumbolokopein, teknopoiein, psoragrian.


   (ii.) Declension of nouns:


   Declension 1. Nouns in -r?, -uia, form gen. in es, dat. e, machaire,
   machaires Gen. xxvii. 40, Exod. xv. 9 ("vielfach bei A, bes. in
   Jerem.," W.-Schm.), kunomuies Exod. viii. 17, epibebekuies 1 Regn. xv.
   20

   Declension 2. Certain nouns in -ous end also in -os, e.g. cheimarros,
   adelphidos. The Attic form in -eos disappears; e.g. laos and naos are
   written for leos and neos--the latter however occurs in 2 Macc. (A).
   Nouns in -archos pass occasionally into the first declension, e.g.
   toparches Gen. xli. 34, komarches Esth. ii. 3, genesiarches Sap. xiii.
   3   osteon usu. contr. in nom. acc., uncontr. in gen. dat.

   Declension 3. Uncontracted forms are frequent, as bathea Job xii. 22,
   pecheon, cheileon, and in the plural nom. and acc. of neuters in -as,
   as kerata, perata. Geras makes gen. gerous dat. gerei. Metaplasmus
   occurs in some words, e.g. duo, dusi, pan with masc. noun, pule,
   pulesin (3 Regn. xxii. 11, A), sabbata, sabbasin, tessares tessarois,
   cheir, cheiran. Acc. in -an for -a, nuktan Exod. xiii. 21, tinan Nah.
   iii. 19, and freq. in ' and A [664] .

   Proper nouns. Many are mere transliterations and indeclinable, e.g.
   Adam, Abraam, Ioseph, Samouel, Daueid, Achaab, Eleiou, Eleisaie,
   Daniel. On the other hand some well-known names receive Greek
   terminations and are declined, as Mouses or Moses, Iesous, Hezekias,
   Esaias, Ieremias; while some are found in both forms, e.g. we have both
   Eleiou and El(e)ias, Manasse, and Manasses, Solomon indecl. and Solomon
   gen. -monos or -montos. But in the translated books the indeclinable
   forms prevail, and there is no appearance of the forms Abramos,
   Israelos, Iosepos, which are familiar to the reader of Josephus. In the
   case of local names transliteration is usual, e.g. Ierousalem,
   Bethleem, Baithel, Seion. A few however have Greek terminations, as
   Samareia or Samaria, Iordanos, and some names of foreign localities are
   Hellenised, as Babulon, Suria, he eruthra thalassa, Idoumaia, Aiguptos,
   and the two Egyptian towns Heroon polis (Gen. xlvi. 28), Heliou polis
   (Exod. i. 11). The declension of the Hellenised names presents some
   irregularities; thus we find Mouses, -se, -sei, -sen; Iesous, -sou,
   -soi, -soun; Manasses, -se.


   (iii.) Conjugation of verbs


   Augments. Doubled, as in kekaterantai Num. xxii. 6, xxiv. 9,
   apekatestesen Gen. xxiii. 16, paresuneblethe Ps. xlviii. 13, 21 (A).
   Prefixed to prepositions, e.g. epronomeusan Num. xxi. 1, Deut. ii. 35,
   epropheteusan Num. xi. 25 f., enotisanto 2 Esdr. xix. 30 (B).
   Lengthened, as emellon Sap. xviii. 4, eboulomen Isa. i. 29, xiii. 9,
   edunethen, edunasthen 2 Chr. xx. 37, Jer. v. 4. Omitted, as in anethe
   Jud. viii. 3, aphethe Isa. xxxiii. 24, autarkesen Deut. xxxii. 10,
   exolothreuen 1 Chr. xxi. 15, iden Gen. i. 4, katorthothe 2 Chr. xxxv.
   10.

   Tenses and Persons. (1) Verbs in -o. New presents, as amphiazo,
   gregoro, benno, ktenno. Futures and aorists [665] with reduplication:
   kekraxomai (Job vi. 5), ekekraxa (Num. xi. 2), epepoithesa (Jud. ix. 26
   A); cf. ekekragon, Isa. vi. 3. Contracted futures in -o from -aso: erga
   Gen. iv. 2, harpa Lev. xix. 13, ekdikatai Deut. xxxii. 43, enkaucha Ps.
   li. 3, sumbiba Isa. xl. 13, apodokimo Jer. xxxviii. (xxxi.) 37. Futures
   (and aor.) with short vowels, poneso, Isa. xix. 10. Irregular futures:
   edomai, phagomai, cheo (Exod. iv. 9). Second aor. forms with
   termination in -a: eidamen 1 Regn. x. 14, ephugan 2 Regn. x. 14,
   ephagamen 2 Regn. xix. 42, elthato Esth. v. 4. Person endings: 2nd p.
   s. pres. pass. or middle in -sai: piesai, phagesai (Ezech. xiii. 18,
   Ruth ii. 9, 14), apexenousai 3 Regn. xiv. 6. 3rd p. pl. imperf, and
   aor. act. in -osan: egennosan Gen. vi. 4, elthosan Exod. xv. 27,
   kateliposan Exod. xvi. 24, katenoousan Exod. xxxiii. 8, enomousan
   Ezech. xxii. 11; cf. the opt. ainesaisan Gen. xlix. 8, elthoisan Deut.
   xxxiii. 16. 3rd p. pl. aor. mid. in -ento: epelathento Jud. iii. 7 (A),
   Hos. xiii. 6 (B), Jer. xviii. 15 (B*A), &c. 3rd p. pl. perf. act. in
   -an: heorakan Deut. xi. 7; pepoithan, Judith vii. 10. 2nd p. s. 1st
   aor. and perf. act. in -es; apestalkes Exod. v. 22; edokes, 2 Esdr.
   xix. 10, Ezech. xvi. 21. (2) Verbs in -mi. From eimi we have emen,
   estha. From kathemai, kathou Ps. cix. (cx.) 1. From histemi,
   hestekenai, hestekos. From didomi, edideto Exod. v. 13 (A), Jer. xii.
   34; doi, Ps. xli. 3 (B), 2 Regn. iii. 39 (A).


   III. SYNTAX.


   Many of the irregularities which fall under this head are due to the
   influence of the Hebrew text or of Semitic habits of thought. These
   will be treated in the next section. In this place we shall limit
   ourselves to constructions which appear to be characteristic of the
   Greek idiom used by the translators.


   Cases and Numbers. Nom. for voc., e.g. ho theos for thee, Ps. xxi. 2,
   esp. in the phrase Kurie ho theos; thugater = thugater, Ruth ii. 2, 22,
   iii. 1, &c. Disuse of the Dual.

   Comparison. Use of a preposition with the positive for the comparative,
   e.g. megas para pantas, Exod. xviii. 11; agathos huper deka, 1 Regn. i.
   8.

   Numerals. Hepta = heptakis, Gen. iv. 24. Omission of kai when numbers
   are coupled, e.g. deka duo, deka hex, deka tente, &c.

   Verbs. Relative rarity of the optative mood [666] , and disappearance
   of that mood in dependent clauses. Periphrasis with eimi, e.g.
   pepoithos esomai, 2 Regn. xxii. 3; isthi pepoithos, Prov. iii. 5.
   Indicative with an: imperf. and aor., hotan eisercheto, Gen. xxxviii.
   9; hotan eperen, Exod. xvii. 11; hotan katebe, Num. xi. 9; heniaa an
   eiseporeueto, Jud. vi. 3; ean espeiran, Jud. vi. 2. Coordination of
   indicative with conjunctive: Exod. viii. 8 exapostelo autous, kai
   thusosi, Lev. vi. 2 psuche ean hamarte kai . . .paride . . . kai
   pseusetai, e edikesen . . . e heuren . . . kai pseusetai . . . kai
   omose ktl. Use of infinitive, with or without the article, to express
   object, purpose, subject, or result [667] ; e.g. (a) ezetei anelein,
   Exod. ii. 15: erxato tou oikodomein, 2 Chr. iii. 1; (b) paraginetai
   boethenai, 2 Regn. viii. 5; apesteilen tou idein, Gen. viii. 7; (c)
   sunebe kremasthenai, Gen xli. 13; to proskollasthai agathon Ps. lxxii.
   28; (d) ho theos ego tou thanatosai kai zoopoiesai, 4 Regn. v. 7.

   Connexion of the sentence. Use of gen. abs. in reference to the subject
   of the verb: e.g. poreuomenou sou . . . hora, Exod. iv. 21.
   Anacoluthon: idon de Pharao . . . ebarunthe he kardia Pharao, Exod. ix.
   7. Use of the finite verb where the classical language prefers to
   employ a participle.


   9. Besides the non-classical forms and constructions which may fairly
   be placed to the credit of Alexandrian Greek, the translated books of
   the Greek Bible naturally exhibit a large number of irregularities
   which are of Semitic origin. The following are examples.


   (a) Lexical.


   1. Transliterations, and Greek words formed from the Hebrew or Aramaic.

   2. Words coined or adopted to express Semitic ideas, as akrobustia,
   anathematizein, holokautoma, skandalizein, splanchnizein.

   3. Phrases answering to the Hebrew idiom: e.g. arton phagein = 'kl
   lchm, eleos poiein meta tinos = sh chsd m, enopion tou kuriou =
   lphnyyhvh, zetein psuchen = bqs nphs, thusia soteriou = slmym zvch,
   lambanein prosopon = ns' phnym, pasa sarx = klbsr, huios tesserakonta
   kai henos eniauton = bn'rbym v'cht snch.

   4. Words with a new connotation: hagios, hamartolos, arete, aphorisma,
   aphron, diabolos, diatheke, dikaiosune, ekklesia, eleemosune,
   exilasmos, kardia, Kurios or ho kurios, leitourgein, mataiotes,
   hosiotes, peirazein, prophetes, ptochos, sarx, phugadeuterion.


   (b) Grammatical [668] .


   Nouns. Repeated to express distribution, e. g. anthropos anthropos =
   'ys 'ys, Num. ix. 10; ethne ethne = gvy gvy, IV Regn. xvii. 29.
   Similarly duo duo, Gen. vi. 19; kata mikron mikron (AF), Exod. xxiii.
   30. Emphatic adverbs also are occasionally doubled after the Hebrew
   manner, as sphodra sphodra, Exod. i. 12, Ezech. ix. 9; cf. sphodra
   sphodros, Gen. vii. 19 (A).

   Pronouns. Otiose use, e.g. Gen. xxx. 1 teleuteso ego ('nky mth); Exod.
   ii. 14 su theleis ('th 'mr); Exod. xxxvi. 4 autos, autoi. To Semitic
   influence is also due the wearisome iteration of the oblique cases of
   personal pronouns answering to the Hebrew suffixes, e.g. Jer. ii. 26
   autoi kai hoi basileis auton kai hoi archontes auton kai hoi hiereis
   auton kai hoi prophetai auton. The fem. haute is occasionally used for
   touto after the manner of the Heb. z't, as in Gen. xxxv. 17, 27, xxxvi.
   1, Ps. cxvii. (cxviii.) 23; see Driver on 1 Sam. iv. 7. To the
   circumstance that the Hebrew relative is indeclinable we owe the
   pleonastic use of the pronoun after the Greek relative in such passages
   as Gen. xxviii. 13, eph' hes . . . ep' autes ('sr . . . lyh); Deut. i.
   22 di hes . . . en aute ('sr . . . bh); Prov. iii. 15 hon . . . auton.
   A similar redundancy occurs with relative adverbs: Deut. ix. 28, hothen
   . . . ekeithen (msm . . . 'sr); II Chr. i. 3, hou . . . ekei.

   Verbs. The following Hebraisms may be specially noted. Various phrases
   used to represent the Heb. inf. abs. when prefixed to a finite verb,
   e.g. Exod. iii. 7, idon idon (r'h r'yty); Deut. xxxi. 18, apostrophe
   apostrepso (hstr 'styr); also the Heb. idiom vysph l: e.g. Exod. xiv.
   13, ou prosthesesthe eti idein, 1 Regn. iii. 6 prosetheto kai ekalesen
   (cf. v. 8 proseth. kalesai, Job xxix. 1 prostheis eipen (vysph . . .
   vy'mr). Constructions with prepositions contrary to the Greek idiom:
   bdelussesthai apo (m?pny), Exod. i. 12; pheidesthai epi, Deut. vii. 16;
   eperotan en Kurio (s'l byhvh), 1 Regn. x. 22; eudokein en or epi
   (chphts b). Hebrew forms of adjuration as 1 Regn. iii. 14 ei ('m)
   exilasthesetai, ib. 17 tade poiesei soi ho theos, ean . . . A question
   standing for the expression of a wish: Num. xi. 29 kai tis doe panta
   ton laon Kuriou . . . ; Ps. lii. (liii.) 6 tis dosei ek Seion to
   soterion tou Israel; Ego eimi followed by an ind. (Jud. vi. 18 ego eimi
   kathisomai, 2 Regn. ii. 2 ego eimi poreusomai)--a construction limited
   in B to Judges, Ruth, 2--4 Regn. Periphrases such as esomai didonai
   (Tob. v. 15, BA). Pleonastic use of legon = l'mvr, often
   soloecistically: e.g. Gen. xv. 1 egenethe rhema Kuriou . . . legon,
   xlv. 16 dieboethe he phone . . . legontes.

   Particles. Pleonastic use of kai and de, (1) in an apodosis, e.g. Num.
   xv. 14, ean . . . prosgenetai, . . . , kai poiesei karpoma; Prov. i.
   28, estai hotan . . . ego de . . . ; (2) after a participle: Num. xxi.
   11, kai exarantes . . . kai parenebalon. Use of kai in a coordinated
   clause, where a dependent clause might have been expected; e.g. Num.
   xxxv. 2, suntaxeis tois huiois Israel, kai dosousin ktl.

   Prepositions. See under Verbs. Peculiar uses of the Heb. prepositions
   are often reflected in the Greek; e.g. 1 Regn. i. 24, anebe en moscho
   (bphrym); Lev. xxi. 10, ho megas apo ton adelphon autou (hgdvl
   m?'chyv). A number of new prepositions or prepositional phrases are
   used to express the Hebrew lphny, e.g. enanti, apenanti, katenanti,
   enopion, katenopion, apo, epi, pro, prosopou. Similarly opiso
   represents 'chry; en meso, ana meson, dia mesou = btvk, apo (ek) mesou
   = m?tvk; dia cheiros, eis cheiras, ek cheiros = byd ,m?yd; hodon = drk.
   The use of sunto express the prefix 't, which is characteristic of
   Aquila, occurs in codex A six times in 3 Regn., once in Esther (where
   it probably came from the Hexapla), and frequently in Ecclesiastes,
   where even cod. B shews this peculiarity, e.g. Eccl. ii. 17 emisesa sun
   ten zoen ('thchyym) [669] .


   10. Both the vocabulary and the syntax of the LXX. exhibit remarkable
   affinities with the modern language. Mr Geldart (Modern Greek Language,
   p. 102 f.) urges the study of modern Greek upon Biblical students on
   the ground that "the Greek of the present day affords a better
   commentary on the language of the LXX. and of the N.T. than the
   writings of contemporary historians, rhetoricians, grammarians and
   philosophers [670] ." He adds: "The phraseology of the LXX. is modern
   to an extent which is quite marvellous . . . let me mention a few
   well-known words common to the LXX. and modern Greek: episkeptomai,
   apokrinomai, epistrepho, proskuno, enopion, proskomma, peirazo,
   akoloutho, koimomai, holos, katoiko, kathezomai, kathizo, ta himatia,
   hup?ago . . . The Greek of the N.T. . . . is by no means so vulgar, so
   merely a vernacular, as that of the LXX." This estimate is perhaps
   overdone; certainly there are considerations which suggest caution in
   the use of modern Greek usage as a key to the meaning of the LXX. But
   the general similarity of the Alexandrian vocabulary and, to a less
   extent, of the Alexandrian syntax to those of the spoken language
   indicates a common affinity to the old colloquial Greek, which
   ultimately triumphed over the classical standards [671] . That the
   resemblance is less marked in the case of the New Testament is due to
   the different circumstances under which it was written. Bilingual
   Palestinian writers of the first century naturally possessed a more
   limited vocabulary and employed a more chastened style than Alexandrian
   translators of the time of Philadelphus and Euergetes, who had been
   born in the heart of a great Greek city teeming with a cosmopolitan
   population.


   11. Some of the non-canonical books of the Greek Old Testament, which
   were either (a) loosely translated or paraphrased from a Hebrew
   original, or (b) originally written in Greek, need separate treatment
   in regard to their lexical and grammatical character. Such are (a) 1
   Esdras, Daniel (LXX.), (b) Wisdom, 2--4 Maccabees.

   The lexicography of the 'Apocrypha' has been separately treated by C.
   A. Wahl (Clavis Abr. V. T. apocryphorum philologica, Leipzig, 1853),
   and with the help of the Oxford Concordance it may be studied
   independently. But, for the sake of the student who has not the
   necessary leisure to examine the subject in detail, it is desirable to
   notice here the more conspicuous words in each of the books referred to
   above.

   WISDOM.


   This book contains an unusually large vocabulary, consisting in great
   part of compound words. The following list, taken from c. i.--vi., will
   suffice to shew its lexical character [672] .


   agerochia (2, 3 Macc.) autoschedios
   adiaptotos             aphthonos
   athanasia (4 Macc.)    baskania (4 Macc.)
   akatamachetos          dekameniaios
   akelidotos (Ps.¹ )     diorthotes
   akoimetos              duschrestos (Isa.¹ )
   alazoneuesthai (Ps.¹ ) episphalos
   amarantos              epitedeios (1 Chr., 1--3 Macc.)
   amoluntos              epiphemizein (Deut.¹ )
   anapodismos            ergateia
   aneklipes              euklees (Jer.¹ )
   anexikakia             eukuklos
   anupokritos            eumorphia (3 Macc.)
   apemantos              eustochos
   apologia               thumeres
   apotomos, apotomos     idiotes (3 Macc.)
   atelestos              kakopragia
   atimetos (3 Macc.)     kakotechnos

   katadapanan                          polugonos (4 Macc.)
   katalupos                            pompeuein
   katachreos                           protoplastos
   makrobios (Isa.¹ )                   stephanephorein
   monoemeros                           sungnostos
   homoiopathes (4 Macc.)               sullogismos (Ex.¹ )
   hoplopoiein                          tekmerion (3 Macc.)
   paradoxos (Judith, Sir., 2, 4 Macc.) philanthropos


   In 2--4 Maccabees the reader finds himself at length face to face with
   the full richness of the Alexandrian literary style, as it was written
   by cultured Hellenists of the second and first centuries B.C. The
   writers, especially the writer of 4 Maccabees, may be said to revel in
   the use of compound words, many of which may have been of their own
   coinage. Specimens follow.

   In the style of the originally Greek books there is little to remind us
   of the Semitic origin of the writers. The Wisdom of Solomon follows
   generally the parallelisms of Hebrew poetry, and its language is
   moulded to some extent by the LXX., of the Psalms and of Proverbs. In
   1--4 Maccabees the influence of the canonical books appears in the
   retention of transliterated names such as Abraam, Israel, Daniel. But
   Ierousalem, has become Ierosoluma, and Eleazar is usually Eleazaros. Of
   Hebrew constructions or modes of thought there is only an occasional
   instance, whilst it is obvious that the writers lose no opportunity of
   exhibiting their skill in the literary style of contemporary
   Alexandrian Greek.

   accentuation, punctuation, and the abbreviations used in Biblical Greek
   MSS.; but within its own scope it is a serviceable book.

  CHAPTER V.

    THE SEPTUAGINT AS A VERSION.

   THE purpose of this chapter is to prepare the beginner for grappling
   with the problems presented by the Septuagint when it is regarded as a
   translation of the Hebrew Bible. Almost at the outset of his study of
   the Alexandrian version he will find himself confronted by difficulties
   which can only be met by a study of the general purpose and character
   of the work, the limitations by which the translators were beset, and
   the principles which guided them in the performance of their task.


   I. The reader of the Septuagint must begin by placing before his mind
   the conditions under which it was produced, and the relation of the
   original work to our present texts, Hebrew and Greek.


   1. (a) Strictly speaking the Alexandrian Bible is not a single version,
   but a series of versions produced at various times and by translators
   whose ideals were not altogether alike. Internal evidence [673] of this
   fact may be found in the varying standards of excellence which appear
   in different books or groups of books. The Pentateuch is on the whole a
   close and serviceable translation; the Psalms [674] and more especially
   the Book of Isaiah shew obvious signs of incompetence. The translator
   of Job was perhaps more familiar with Greek pagan literature [675] than
   with Semitic poetry; the translator of Daniel indulges at times in a
   Midrashic paraphrase. The version of Judges which appears in our oldest
   Greek uncial MS. has been suspected by a recent critic [676] of being a
   work of the 4th century A.D.; the Greek Ecclesiastes savours of the
   school of Aquila [677] . When we come to details, the evidence in
   favour of a plurality of translators is no less decisive. A comparison
   of certain passages which occur in separate contexts distinctly reveals
   the presence of different hands. The reader can readily form a
   judgement upon this point if he will place side by side in the Hebrew
   and the Greek 2 Regn. xxii. 2 ff. and Ps. xvii. (xviii.) 3 ff., 4 Regn.
   xviii. 17--xx. 19 and Isa. xxxvi. 1--xxxix. 8, or Mic. iv. and Isa. ii.


   A single specimen may be given from Ps. xvii. compared with 2 Regn.
   xxiii.

   Ps. xvii. 3--6. 2 Regn. xxii. 2--6.
   ^3Kurios stereoma mou kai kataphuge mou kai rhustes mou; ho theos mou
   boethos kai elpio ep' auton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ^4ainon
   epikalesomai Kurion, kai ek ton echthron mou sothesomai. ^5perieschon
   me odines thanatou, kai cheimarroi anomias exetaraxan me; ^6odines
   hadou periekuklosan me, proephthasan me pagides thanatou. ?^7kai en to
   thlibesthai me epekalesamen ton kurion, kai pros ton theon mou
   ekekraxa; ekousen ek naou hagiou autou phones mou, kai he krauge mou
   [enopion autou eiseleusetai] eis ta ota autou. ^2Kurie petra mou kai
   ochuroma mou kai exairoumenos me emoi; ^3ho theos mou phulax estai mou,
   pepoithos esomai ep' auto . . . . ^4aineton epikalesomai Kurion, kai ek
   ton echthron mou sothesomai. ^5hoti perieschon me suntrimmoi thanatou,
   cheimarroi anomias ethambesan me; ^6odines thanatou ekuklosan me,
   proephthasan me sklerotetes thanatou. ^7en to thlibesthai me
   epikalesomai Kurion, kai pros ton theon mou boesomai, kai epakousetai
   ek naou autou phones mou, kai he krauge mou en tois osin autou.

   One of these versions has doubtless influenced the other, but that they
   are the work of separate hands seems to be clear from the differences
   of method which appear e.g. in the renderings of
   mtsvdh sl in the first verse, and the use of the aorist and the future
   in vv. 6, 7.


   If further proof is needed it may be found in the diverse renderings of
   the same Hebrew words in different parts of the Canon. This argument
   must be used with caution, for (as we shall presently see) such
   diversities are to be found not only in the same book but in the same
   context. But after making allowance for variations of this kind, there
   remain abundant instances in which the diversity can only be attributed
   to a change of hand. Thus plstym is uniformly represented in the
   Hexateuch by Phulistieim, but in Judges and the later books by
   allophuloi; psch is phasek or phasech in Chronicles^(18) and
   Jeremiah^1, but pescha in all other books; 'vrym is delosis or deloi in
   the Pentateuch, but in Ezra-Nehemiah photizontes, photison; tmym is
   aletheia in Exodus, but in Ezra teleion; in Isaiah tsv't is sabaoth
   more than 50 times, whilst pantokrator, which in other books, is the
   almost uniform rendering of the word when it is used as a title of
   Deity, does not once occur; qhl is sunagoge in Gen., Exod., Lev., Num.,
   and again in the Prophets, but ekklesia in Deuteronomy (with one
   exception) and onwards to the end of the historical books. The singular
   [678] phrase ego eimi = 'nky is limited to Judges, Ruth, and 2--4
   Regn.; sun = 't of the object occurs in the true LXX. only in
   Ecclesiastes; amen is peculiar to Chronicles and Ezra, other books
   which contain the Heb. word (Num., Deut., 1 Regn., Psalms, Jer.)
   preferring genoito. Similar results may be obtained from a comparison
   of the forms assumed by the same proper names in different books.
   Elijah ('lyhv) is Eleiou in the Books of Kings, but Elias in Malachi
   and Sirach. The lists in Chronicles use the Hebrew form of Gentile
   names (Thekoei, Anathothei, &c.), where other books adopt the Greek
   (Thekoeites, Anathotheites, &c.). In Ezra 'chsvdvs becomes Assoueros,
   but Artaxerxes is substituted by the translator of Esther, and Xerxes
   by the LXX. translator of Daniel (ix. 1) [679] . It is difficult to
   resist the force of this cumulative evidence in support of a plurality
   of translators, especially when it is confirmed by what we know of the
   external history of the Septuagint.

   (b) Further it is clear that the purpose of the version in the later
   books is not altogether that which the translators of the Pentateuch
   had in view. The Greek Pentateuch, as we have seen, was intended to
   supply the wants of the Alexandrian Synagogue. The Book of the Twelve
   Prophets, and the three major Prophets, were probably translated with
   the same general purpose, but under a diminished sense of
   responsibility, since the Prophets, even after their admission to the
   Canon, were not regarded as sharing the peculiar sanctity of the Law.
   But the Hagiographa, excepting perhaps the Psalter, stood on a much
   lower level, and such books as Job, Esther, and Daniel were perhaps
   viewed by the Alexandrians as national literature [680] which was not
   yet classical and might be treated with the freedom allowed by custom
   in such cases to the interpreter and the scribe. Our estimate of the
   translator's work must clearly take account of his attitude towards the
   book upon which he is engaged.

   (c) It is important also to bear in mind the peculiar difficulties
   which beset the translators in their attempts to render the Hebrew
   Scriptures into Greek. To translate a Semitic book into the language of
   the West was a new venture when it was undertaken at Alexandria; the
   Greek Pentateuch "was the work of pioneers and necessarily had the
   defects of such work [681] ." No wonder if even in the later books the
   Hebrew idiom refused to lend itself to the forms even of Hellenistic
   Greek without losing to some extent its identity, as the translator of
   Sirach complains [682] . Moreover the majority of the translators had
   probably learnt the sacred language in Egypt from imperfectly
   instructed teachers, and had few opportunities of making themselves
   acquainted with the traditional interpretation of obscure words and
   contexts which guided the Palestinian Jew [683] . The want of a sound
   tradition is especially manifest in poetical passages and books, and it
   makes itself felt in the numerous transliterations, and in faulty
   readings and renderings of the text [684] . Such things may well make
   the reader smile at the claim of inspiration which was set up for the
   LXX., but they ought neither to mislead his judgement, nor to lessen
   his admiration for the courage and the general success of the
   Alexandrian translators.


   2. The student must also endeavour to realise the condition of the
   Hebrew text which lay before the Alexandrian translators.

   (a) The text of the Hebrew Bible has undergone no material change since
   the beginning of the second century A.D. A vast store of various
   readings has been collected from the MSS. by the diligence of Kennicott
   and De Rossi, but few among them appear to be more than the omissions
   or corruptions which spring from the accidents of transcription. All
   existing MSS. belong to one type of text, and it is, in the main, the
   type which was known to Jerome, to Origen, and to Aquila, and which is
   reflected in the Targums and the Talmud. But it is not that which was
   possessed by the Alexandrians of the third and second centuries, B.C.
   At some time between the age of the LXX. and that of Aquila a thorough
   revision of the Hebrew Bible must have taken place, probably under
   official direction; and the evidence seems to point to the Rabbinical
   school which had its centre at Jamnia in the years that followed the
   fall of Jerusalem as the source from which this revision proceeded
   [685] . The subject, as a whole, will be treated in a later chapter;
   meanwhile it is sufficient to warn the beginner that in the LXX. he has
   before him the version of an early text which often differed materially
   from the text of the printed Hebrew Bible and of all existing Hebrew
   MSS.

   (b) The palaeographical character of the MSS. employed by the
   translators requires consideration. It will be remembered that the
   newly discovered fragments of Aquila present the Tetragrammaton in
   archaic letters [686] . These letters belong to the old Semitic
   alphabet which was common to the Hebrew, Moabite, Aramaic, and
   Phoenician languages, and which appears on the Moabite stone and in the
   Siloam inscription and, with some modifications, in MSS. of the
   Samaritan Pentateuch, and on coins of the Maccabean period. The
   transition from this ancient character to the square letters [687]
   which are used in existing Hebrew MSS. and in the printed Bibles must
   have been practically complete in our Lord's time, since He refers to
   the yodh as the smallest letter, and to the kereai which are peculiar
   to the square alphabet (Mt. v. 18). That the change had begun in the
   MSS. employed by the Alexandrian translators [688] may be gathered from
   the fact that they repeatedly confuse letters which are similar in the
   square character but not in the archaic. Professor Driver holds that
   the alphabet of their MSS. was a transitional one, in which v and v ,y
   and ch h ,m and m, as well as v and d ,k and r were more or less
   difficult to distinguish [689] .


   A few examples may be given from Driver's list. (1) 1 Regn. ii. 29
   ophthalmo (yn, for vn ); xii. 3 apokrithete kat' emou (nv vy for yny
   vv); Ps. xxi. (xxii.) 17 oruxan (k'rv, for k'ry); Isa. xxix. 13 maten
   de sebontai me (vthv yr'tm 'ty, for vthy yr'tm 'ty). ?(2) 1 Regn. vi.
   20 dielthein (lvr, for lmd); Jer. xxvi. (xlvi.) 25 ton huion autes (vnh
   for mn')? [690] ; 1 Regn. iv. 10 tagmaton (dgly, for rgly), xxi. 7 Doek
   ho Suros (d'g h'rmy, for d h'dmy).

   Another cause of confusion was the scriptio defectiva in the case of v
   and y where they represent long vowels, e.g. 1 Regn. xii. 8 kai
   katokisen autous (vysyvm for vysvvm); Ps. v. tit. huper tes
   kleronomouses ('l hnchlt, for 'l hnchylvt); Job xix. 18 eis ton aiona
   (lm, for vylym); Jer. vi. 23 hos pur (k's, for k'ys). Abbreviations,
   also, probably gave rise to misunderstandings; see the instances in
   Driver, op. cit., pp. lxiii. f., lxx. note 2, and others collected from
   Jeremiah by Streane, Double Text, p. 20.

   In the case of numerals errors appear to have arisen from the use of
   similar letters as numerical signs: e.g. 2 Regn. xxiv. 13 tria ete,
   'seven years,' where v has been read for g. Here has the support of the
   Chronicler (1 Chron. xxi. 12): see König in Hastings' D.B., iii. p.
   562.


   Further, in the MSS. used by the LXX. the words seem not to have been
   separated by any system of punctuation or spacing. On the Moabite stone
   [691] and in the Siloam inscription [692] a point has been used for
   this purpose, but the Phoenician inscriptions are without punctuation,
   and so were probably the early Biblical rolls. The division adopted by
   the LXX. is frequently at variance with that of the Massoretic text,
   and is sometimes preferable to the latter, sometimes inferior; but the
   differences witness to the absence of divisions in the Hebrew MSS. and
   the non-employment of the final letters ts ph n m k.


   Thus Gen. xlix. 19, 20 auton kata podas. Aser . . . = qv 'sr ?(
   qv m'sr); Deut. xxvi. 5 Surian apebalen = 'rm y'vd ?( 'r#1502;y 'vd); ?
   1 Regn. i. 1 en Naseib = vnyv ? ( , vn tsvph); Ps. xliii. (xliv.) 5 ho
   theos mou ho entellomenos = 'lhy mtsvh ?( , tsvh 'lhym); Jer. xxvi.
   (xlvi.) 15 dia ti ephugen apo sou ho Apis = chph mdv nm ?( , mdv
   nschph); Zech. xi. 7 eis ten Chanaaniten = lknny ?( nyy lkn).


   Lastly, almost every page of the LXX. yields evidence that the Hebrew
   text was as yet unpointed. Vocalisation was in fact only traditional
   until the days of the Massora, and the tradition which is enshrined in
   the Massoretic points differs, often very widely, from that which was
   inherited or originated by the Alexandrian translators [693] .


   A few examples may suffice: Gen. xv. 11 kai sunekathisen autois = vysv
   'tm ?( , vysv 'tm); Num. xvi. 5 epeskeptai = bqr ?( , bqr); ?1 Regn.
   xii. 2 kathesomai = ysvty ?( , vsvty); Nah. iii. 8 merida Ammon = mnt
   'mvn ?( , mn' 'mvn) Isa. ix. 8 thanaton (dvr , ? , dvr) apesteilen
   Kurios epi Iakob. In proper names the differences of the vocalisation
   are still more frequent and apparent, e.g. Madiam (mdyn); Balaam (blm),
   Gomorra (mrh), Chodollogomor (kdrlmr), Phasga (psgh), Sampson (smsvn).


   (c) One other preliminary consideration remains. The student must not
   leave out of sight the present state of the Greek text. A homogeneous
   text is not to be found even in the oldest of our uncial MSS., and the
   greater number of Greek codices are more or less influenced by the
   Hexapla. The Lucianic text is subject to another vice, the Antiochian
   passion for fulness, which encouraged the blending or the accumulation
   of various renderings and thus created doublets [694] . Besides these
   recensional errors there are the mistakes, itacistic or other, which
   are incident to the transmission of ancient books. The state of the
   Greek text has been touched upon already, and will form the subject of
   a chapter in the third part of this book. Here it is sufficient to
   notice the presence of mixture and corruption as a factor in the
   problem which the student of the LXX. must keep in view.


   II. We are now prepared to deal with those features of the version
   which are not incidental but characteristic of the translators'
   principles and methods.


   1. The reader of the Alexandrian Greek Bible is continually reminded
   that he has before him a translation of a Semitic writing.


   (a) As a whole the version aims at fidelity, and often pursues this aim
   to the extent of sacrificing the Greek idiom. The first chapter of
   Genesis will supply instances of extreme literalness, e.g. v. 4 ana
   meson tou photos kai ana meson tou skotous; v. ?5? egeneto hespera kai
   egeneto proi, hemera mia; v. 20 herpeta psuchon zoson. As we proceed,
   we are still conscious of moving in an atmosphere which is Hebrew and
   not Greek. Hebrew constructions meet us everywhere; such phrases as
   aphikesthai heos pros tina, parasiopan apo tinos, prostithenai (tou)
   poiein, lalein en cheiri tinos, echthes kai triten, apo geneon eis
   geneas (heos geneas kai geneas, eis genean kai genean) may be found in
   the Prophets and Hagiographa as well as in the Pentateuch. Occasionally
   the translators set the sense at defiance in their desire to be true to
   what they conceive to be the meaning of the Hebrew, as when in 1 Regn.
   i. 26 they render by (deomai) by en emoi. In some books, especially
   perhaps in the Psalms and in Isaiah, entire sentences are
   unintelligible from this cause. Even when the Alexandrians have rightly
   understood their original they have generally been content to render it
   into Greek with little regard for rhythm or style, or the requirements
   of the Greek tongue.


   (b) To the same spirit of loyalty may be ascribed in part the
   disposition to transliterate words which present unusual difficulty.
   The number of transliterations other than those of proper names is
   considerable [695] , and they are to be found in nearly all the
   translated books. In some cases they are due to misunderstanding, as in
   Jud. i. 19 Rhechab diesteilato autois where h) vrzl) seems to have been
   read as hvrzl, and rkv consequently treated as a proper name; in
   others, the Hebrew form is purposely maintained (e.g. hallelouia,
   amen). But in the majority of instances transliteration may be taken
   for a frank confession of ignorance or doubt; it is clearly such, for
   example, in Jud. viii. 7 en tais abarkenein, 4 Regn. ii. 14 aphpho ('ph
   hv'), Jer. xxxviii. (xxxi.) 40 pantes hasaremoth heos nachal Kedron. As
   in the first and third of these specimens, the article is often
   included; and when a proper name is transliterated, the name is
   sometimes for this reason not easily recognised; thus Ramathaim (1
   Regn. i. 1) becomes Armathaim (hrmtym)? [696] . Similarly the h local
   is taken over in the transliteration, as in Gen. xxxv. 6 eis Louza =
   lvzh. Sometimes two words are rolled into one, as in Oulammaus = 'vlm
   lvz (Gen. xxviii. 19) [697] . A doublet is occasionally created by
   adding a translation to the transliterated Hebrew, e.g. in 1 Regn. vi.
   11 , 15, to thema ergab, vii. 4 ta alse Astaroth, xxiii. 14 en Maserem
   en tois stenois. In the case of a significant proper name, where it is
   necessary for the reader to be made aware of its meaning, the LXX.
   sometimes translate without transliterating, e. g. Gen. iii. 20
   ekalesen Adam to onoma tes gunaikos autou Zoe (hvh); xi. 9 eklethe to
   onoma autou Sunchusis (bvl); xiv. 13 apengeilen Abram to perate (hvry).


   2. The Alexandrian translators, however, while loyal to their original,
   sometimes even to a fault, manifest nothing like the slavish adherence
   to the letter with which Aquila has been charged. They often amplify
   and occasionally omit; they interpret, qualify or refine; they render
   the same Hebrew words by more than one Greek equivalent, even in the
   same context; they introduce metaphors or grammatical constructions
   which have no place in the Hebrew text and probably at no time had a
   place there, or they abandon figures of speech where they exist in the
   original.


   (a) Slight amplifications, which are probably not to be ascribed to a
   fuller text, occur frequently in all parts of the LXX.; e.g. the
   insertion of legon before a quotation, or of pronouns which are not
   expressed in the Hebrew, or of single words added in order to bring out
   the sense, as in Gen. xxxiv. 10 idou he ge plateia enantion humon, xl.
   17 apo panton ton genematon hon ho basileus Pharao esthiei, Deut. vii.
   16 phage panta ta skula ton ethnon (Heb. 'thou shalt eat all the
   nations'). The translators frequently manifest a desire to supply what
   the original had omitted or to clear up what was ambiguous: they name
   the subject or object when the Hebrew leaves it to be understood (Gen.
   xxix. 9 aute gar ebosken ta probata tou patros autes, Heb. 'fed them';
   xxxiv. 14 kai eipan autois Sumeon kai Leui hoi adelphoi Deinas huioi de
   Leias, Heb. 'and they said unto them'), or they add a clause which
   seems to follow as a necessary consequence (2 Regn. xii. 21 anestes kai
   ephages arton kai pepokas: xvi. 10 kai aphete auton kai houtos
   katarastho = yqll ?(kh q) ?ky, or they make good an aposiopesis (Exod.
   xxxii. 32 ei men apheis autois ten hamartian auton aphes). Less
   frequently they insert a whole sentence which is of the nature of a
   gloss, as in Gen. i. 9 kai sunechthe to hudor to hupokato tou ouranou
   eis tas sunagogas auton kai ophthe which is merely an expansion of kai
   egeneto houtos in the terms of the preceding command sunachtheto ktl.;
   or 1 Regn. i. 5 hoti ouk en aute paidion a reminiscence of v. 2 te
   Hanna ouk en paidion. On the other hand the LXX. not uncommonly present
   a shorter text, as compared with M.T., e.g. Gen. xxxi. 21 kai diebe ton
   potamon (Heb. 'he rose up and passed over'), ib. 31 eipa gar Me pote
   ktl. (Heb. 'Because I was afraid, for I said . . . '); 1 Regn. i. 9
   meta to phagein autous en Selo (Heb. 'after they had eaten in Shiloh
   and after they had drunk').


   (b) The translators frequently interpret words which call for
   explanation. Hebraisms are converted into Greek phraseology, e.g. bnnkr
   becomes allogenes (Exod. xii. 43), and bnsnh eniausios (Num. vii. 15);
   v'ny rl sphtym is rendered by ego de alogos eimi (Exod. vi. 12). A
   difficult word or phrase is exchanged for one more intelligible to a
   Greek reader; thus he eremos is used for hngv (Gen. xii. 9); 'Urim and
   Thummim' become he delosis kai he aletheia (Exod. xxviii. 26); in the
   Psalms antilemptor is written for mgn (Ps. iii. 4), boethos for tsvr
   (xvii. = xviii. 3), and glossafor kvvd (Ps. xv. = xvi. 9); similarly in
   Jer. ii. 23 to poluandrion 'the cemetery' stands for bgy', i.e. the
   valley of Hinnom [698] . An effort is made to represent Hebrew money by
   its nearest Greek equivalent; thus for sql we have didrachmon (Gen.
   xxiii. 15, Deut. xxii. 29, 2 Esdr. xv. 15) as well as siklos, and for
   grh obolos. Occasionally a whole clause is interpreted rather than
   translated; e.g. Gen. i. 2, ? he de ge en aoratos kai akataskeuastos,
   Exod. iii. 14 ego eimi ho on, Ps. xl. (xxxix.) 7 soma de katertiso moi.
   A dogmatic interest has been detected in some of these paraphrastic
   renderings, chiefly where the LXX. have endeavoured to avoid the
   anthropomorphisms of the original; examples are most frequent in the
   Pentateuch, e.g. Gen. xviii. 25 medamos su poieseis (Heb. 'that be far
   from thee'); Exod. iv. 16 su de auto ese ta pros ton theon (l'lhym);
   xxiv. 10 eidon ton topon hou heistekei ho theos tou Israel (Heb. 'they
   saw the God of Israel,' Aq. eidon ton theon Israel; ib. 11 ton
   epilekton tou Israel ou diephonesen oude heis; Num. xii. 8 ten doxan
   (tmnt) Kuriou eiden; Exod. xv. 3 Kurios suntribon polemous
   ('ys mlchmh); Deut. xiv. 23 ho topos hon an eklexetai Kurios ho theos
   sou epiklethenai (lskn) to onoma autou ekei; Jos. iv. 24 he dunamis tou
   kuriou (ydyhvh). Such renderings manifest the same spirit of reverence
   which led the LXX. to write ho kurios, or the anarthrous Kurios, or not
   infrequently ho theos for the Tetragrammaton, just as their Palestinian
   brethren read for it 'dny or 'lhym? [699] . In other places the LXX.
   appear to be guided by the Jewish Halacha, e.g. Gen. ii. 2 sunetelesen
   ho theos en te hemera te hekte (hsvyy, Aq. te hebdome); Lev. xxiv. 7
   epithesete epi to thema libanon katharon kai hala [700] ; xix. 7 ean de
   brosei brothe te hemera te trite, athuton estin (Heb. 'an abomination')
   [701] . Of Haggada also there are clear traces, as in Exod. xii. 40 en
   ge Aigupto kai en ge Chanaan, 1 Regn. i. 14 eipen aute to paidarion
   Elei [702] ; v. 6 kai meson tes choras autes anephuesan mues, kai
   egeneto sunchusis thanatou megale en te polei.


   (c) The LXX. render the same Hebrew word by more than one Greek
   equivalent, sometimes even in the same context. In some cases the
   change appears to be either arbitrary, or due to the desire of avoiding
   monotony; e.g. in Ps. xxxvi. (xxxvii.) rs is translated by hamartolos
   in vv. 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 32, 40, but by asebes in vv. 28, 35,
   38. In many others it may be ascribed to the circumstance that certain
   common Hebrew words take a special colouring from the contexts in which
   they occur, and must be rendered accordingly. Thus ntn, 'give [703] ,'
   which belongs to this class has received in the LXX. more than 30
   different renderings; sometimes it is translated by a paraphrase, e.g.
   Jos. xiv. 12 aitoumai se (tnh ly) Deut. xxi. 8 hina me genetai ('l
   ttn); when it is rendered directly, the following Greek verbs (besides
   didonai and its compounds) are used to represent it: agein,
   apostellein, apotinein, aphienai, deiknunai, doreisthai, ean,
   ektithenai, ektinein, ekcheein, elean, emballein, enkataleipein,
   epairein, epiballein, epitithenai, epicheein, ephistanai, histanai,
   kataballein, kathistanai, katatassein, kremazein, paratithenai,
   peritithenai, poiein, proekpherein, prosienai, prostithenai, sterizein,
   sunagein, pherein. This is a somewhat extreme instance, but a glance at
   Hatch and Redpath will shew that there are many which do not fall far
   behind it, and that in the majority of cases the ordinary words of the
   Hebrew Bible have more than one equivalent in the Greek of the LXX. The
   Alexandrian translators have evidently made an honest endeavour to
   distinguish between the several connotations of the Hebrew words. Thus,
   to take a few examples: qts is variously rendered by akron, arche,
   klitos, meros, peras, taxis, chronos; among the equivalents of dvr are
   apokrisis, eperotesis, krima, pragma, tropos, phone; for lv we have not
   only kardia, psuche, phren, nous, dianoia, stoma, phronesis, but
   stethos and even sarx; for phqd, apithmein, episkeptesthai, etazein,
   ekdikein; for tsdqh, dikaiosune, eleemosune, euphrosune. Conversely,
   the same Greek word often serves for several Hebrew words. Thus
   diatheke, which is generally the LXX. rendering of bryt, stands also
   for dvt (Exod. xxvii. 21, (xxxi. 7), tvrh (Dan. ix. 13, LXX.) and even
   dvr, (Deut. ix. 5); exairein, lutroun, rhuesthai are all used to
   represent g'l; eidolon appears in different contexts for psl ,tsv ,chmn
   ,chvl ,bl ,bmh ,'lyl ,'lvh ,'l ?trphym ,sqts ,tslm. Even in the same
   context, or verse this sometimes occurs. Thus in Gen. i.--iii. ge
   translates tsphr ,sdh ,'dmh ,'rts; in Exod. xii. 23 vr and phsch are
   both represented by parerchesthai; in Num. xv. 4 f. thusia is used both
   for mnchh and zvch. In such cases it is difficult to acquit the
   translators of carelessness; but they are far less frequent than
   instances of the opposite kind. On the whole the LXX. even in the
   Pentateuch shews no poverty of words, and considerable skill in the
   handling of synonyms.


   (d) In reference to metaphors the Alexandrians allow themselves some
   discretion. Thus in Gen. vi. 2 'the sons of God' become hoi angeloi tou
   theou; in Num. xxiv. 17 'a sceptre (svt) shall rise' is rendered by
   anastesetai anthropos; in Deut. x. 16 'the foreskin of your heart' is
   turned euphemistically into ten sklerokardian humon; in Isa. ix. 14
   megan kai mikron represents Heb. 'both branch and rush.' Occasionally
   the translators indulge in paronomasia, without authority from the
   Heb., e.g. Gen. xxv. 27 oikon oikian = yvsv 'hlym; xxvi. 18 kai
   eponomasen autois onomata vyqr' lhn smvt; Job xxvii. 12 kena kenois;
   xxx. 13 exetribesan triboi mou.


   (e) Lastly, the reader of the Septuagint must expect to find a large
   number of actual blunders, due in part perhaps to a faulty archetype,
   but chiefly to the misreading or misunderstanding of the archetype by
   the translators. Letters or clauses have often been transposed;
   omissions occur which may be explained by homoioteleuton; still more
   frequently the translation has suffered through an insufficient
   knowledge of Hebrew or a failure to grasp the sense of the context. It
   follows that the student must be constantly on his guard against errors
   which may easily result from too ready an acceptance of the evidence
   offered by the Alexandrian version. Taken as a whole, and judged in the
   light of the circumstances under which it was produced, it is a
   monument of the piety, the skill, and the knowledge of the Egyptian
   Jews who lived under the Ptolemies, and it is an invaluable witness to
   the pre-Christian text of the Old Testament. But whether for textual or
   for hermeneutical purposes it must be used with caution and reserve, as
   the experience of the Ancient Church shews. With this subject we shall
   deal in a future chapter; it is sufficient to note the fact here.


   III. The beginner, for whose use this chapter is chiefly intended, will
   now be prepared to open his Septuagint and his Hebrew Bible, and to
   compare the two in some familiar contexts. The following notes may
   assist him in a first effort to grapple with the problems which present
   themselves.


   GEN. xv. 1--6.

   1. Ta rhemata . . . rhema, Heb. dvrym . . . dvr. Legon = l'mr; cf. v.
   4, where, as elsewhere, Aq. renders, to legein. Huperaspizo sou, Heb.
   'am a shield to thee'; cf. Deut. xxxiii. 29, Prov. ii. 7, al. Ho
   misthos sou polus. Vulg., A.V., R.V. connect Heb. with the foregoing,
   supplying v. ?2. Despotes = 'dny, as in v. 8, and not infrequently in
   Jer. and Dan. (LXX.). Apoluomai ateknos--an interpretation rather than
   a literal rendering of hvlk ryry? [704] . Huios Masek tes oikogenous
   mou = vn msq vyty: cf. Hieron. quaest. in Gen. "ubi nos habemus Et
   filius Masec vernaculae meae, in Hebraeo scriptum est nvn msq vyty,
   quod Aquila transtulit ho huios tou potizontos oikian mou . . .
   Theodotio vero kai huios tou epi tes oikias mou." Damaskos Eliezer, a
   literal rendering of the Heb., leaving the difficulty unsolved. 3.
   Epeide = hn, and so in xviii. 31, xix. 19; did LXX. read 'm? Oikogenes
   here = bnhbyt. Kleronomesei me--a Hebraism, = kleronomos mou estai. 4.
   kaiuthus . . . egeneto = vhnh. Phone = rvr, as in xi. 1, but apparently
   not elsewhere. hos . . . houtos, 'sr . . . hv'. Ek sou, euphemism for
   Heb. m?myk, unless the LXX. read mmk. ?5. Pros auton, ^ Heb. 6. Kai
   episteusen = vy'mn (cf. Haupt ad loc.). Abram ^ to theo = byhvh.
   Elogisthe . . . eis dik., Heb. 'he counted it . . . for righteousness';
   possibly the LXX. read as in Ps. cvi. 31 (M.T.), where they have the
   same rendering. The N.T. follows LXX. here (Jas. ii. 23, Rom. iv. 3,
   Gal. iii. 6).


   EXOD. xix. 16--24.

   16. Egeneto de . . . kai egenonto = vyhy. . . vyhy. Genethentos pros
   orthron = bhyt hbqr. Ep' orous Seina, Heb. 'on the mountain.' Phone,
   cod. F with pr. kai. 17. Hupo to oros S. (om. S. AF), Heb. 'at the
   nether part (btchtyt) of the mountain:' 18. dia to katabebekenai, an
   idiomatic rendering of m?pny'sr yrd. Ton theon = yhvh, cf. 21. Ho
   kapnos, Heb. 'the smoke of it.' Exeste, Heb. as v. 16 where LXX.
   renders eptoethe. Ho laos = hm; M.T., hhr. ?19. Probainousai
   ischuroterai = hvlk vchzq. ?20. Ekalesen . . . Mousen, Heb. lmsh; the l
   after qr' is dropt in accordance with Greek idiom [705] . 21. Legon, ^
   Heb. Engisosin, a softening of the .Heb. 'break forth' (hrs); in the
   next verse engizein = ngs ni. 22. kai, Heb. 'and also' (vgm), usually
   kai ge, Aq. kai kaige (Burkitt, Aquila, p. 13). Kurio to theo a double
   rendering of 'l yhvh. Apallaxe ap' auton: another instance of
   euphemism: Heb. 'break forth upon them' (Aq. diakopse en autois). 23.
   Prosanabenai: the double compound occurs six times in Jos. xi.--xix.
   Aphorisai: the verb is here as in v. 12 the equivalent of gvl hi.
   'enclose,' but with the added thought of consecration which is latent
   in aphorizein, aphorisma, aphorismos (cf. Exod. xxix. 26, Ezech. xx.
   40). 24. Apolese, euphemistic, as apallaxe in v. 22; Aq. again,
   diakopse.


   NUM. xxiii. 7--10.


   7. Parabolee: here for the first time = msl. Lyons Pent., parabula.
   Mesopotamias, i.e. 'rm nhrym (Gen. xxiv. 10), or 'rm pdn (Gen. xxv.
   20): here an interpretation of the simple 'rm . Ap', legon, []Heb.
   Epikatarasai moi, and katarasomai in v. 8, represent zm, whilst arasai
   answers to 'rr, and arasomai (v. 8) to nqv, an unusual instance of
   carelessness or poverty of language on the part of the translator;
   oreon (v. 9) is equally unfortunate as a rendering of tsrym, while on
   the other hand opsomai, prosnoeso fairly represent the Heb. Prosnoein
   renders svr again in Job xx. 9, xxiv. 15. 10. Exaribazesthai (Num.^1,
   Job^1, Dan. LXX..^1), a late form for exakriboun in LXX. and Jos. To
   sperma, Heb.'the dust': did LXX. read zr, or have they glossed phr? Kai
   tis exarithmesetai, reading vmy ysphr. Demous Israel, Heb. 'the fourth
   part of Israel' (Aq. tou teturtou I.). He psuche mou, as Heb., whilst
   the next word is sacrificed to an alliteration (psuche, psuchais). To
   sperma mou is a gloss on 'chryty (cf. Brown, Heb. and Eng. Lex., p.
   31); hos to sperma touton, Heb. 'as he.'

   This passage illustrates both the greater freedom which the Greek
   translators allowed themselves in poetical contexts, and their
   comparative incompetence to deal with them.


   DEUT. vi. 1--9.


   1. Hautai hai entolai, Heb. 'this is the commandment.' Ho theos hemon,
   Heb. 'your God.' Houtos ^ Heb. Eisporeuesthe, Heb. 'go over'; the Greek
   has lost the local reference, as in iv. 14, 4 Regn. iv. 8. 2. Hina
   phobesthe . . . humon, Heb. 2nd pers. sing. Semeron, ^ . Hoi huioi
   ktl., Heb. 'thy son and thy son's son.'  Hina makroemereusete, Heb.
   'and that thy days may be prolonged'; makroemereuein (makroemeros
   ginesthai) represents this or a similar phrase in iv. 40, v. 30, xi. 9,
   21, xxxii. 47; makrochronios, makrochronizein also occur in iv. 40, v.
   16, xvii. 20, xxxii. 27. The group is not found elsewhere in the LXX.
   except in Exod.^1, Jud.^1, and in Sirach. 3. Dounai ^ M.T.; perhaps
   added to complete the sense of the Greek; yet see v. 10 (ltt lk). ?4.
   Kai tauta . . . Aiguptou ^ Heb; perhaps repeated from iv. 45 to form an
   introduction to Akoue ktl.. 5. Dianoias . . . psuches . . . dunameos.
   The readings vary; for dianoias AF Luc. read kardias, and the text of B
   is here super rasuram; for dunameos some texts give ischuos. The N.T.
   citations (Mt. xxii. 37 = Mc. xii. 29 ff., Lc. x. 27) present much
   diversity, giving both renderings of lvvk and both of m'dk; cf.
   Dittmar, V. T. in Novo, p. 50 f.  6. kai en te psuche sou, ^ Heb.; for
   'in thy heart' Heb. has 'upon,' "as it were imprinted there (Jer. xxxi.
   33) [706] ." 7. Probibaseis, Heb. 'shalt impress them upon'; Aq.
   deueeroseis, as if the root were snh. En autois = bm. Kathemenos ktl.,
   Heb. 'in thy sitting &c.'; en oiko, en hodo are inexact, Heb. 'in thy
   house,' 'in the way.' 8. Asaleuton (F, asaleuta) = lttpht, 'for
   frontlets,' circlets or tires for the head: Lyons Pent. (reading
   saleuta), mobilia. Asaleuton occurs in the same phrase in Exod. xiii.
   16, Deut. xi. 18. Aq. seems to have rendered the Heb. here and in Exod.
   by nakta, i.e. 'compressed,' 'tight,' which Field (Hexapla, i. 103)
   explains as the "thecas in quas schedulae membraneae . . .
   inferciebantur." The LXX. rendering may be an Alexandrian name for the
   phulakterion, but the whole subject is obscure.  9. Phlias = mzzvt, as
   in Exod. xii. 7 ff.


   JOS. x. 12--14.


   12. He hemera paredoken . . . hupocheirion--idiomatic rendering of
   byvm tt . . . lphny. The words that follow (henika . . . Israel) seem
   to be a gloss derived from v. 10. Kai eipen Iesous, Heb. 'and he said
   in the eyes of Israel.' Steto, Heb. 'be still.' Gabaon, 'Gibeon.'
   Ailon. 'Aijalon' ('ylvn); Cf. 2 Chron. xi. 10 A, Aialon. 13. En stasei
   = md, which is thus distinguished from the verb represented by este. Ho
   theos, Heb. gvy, Aq. to ethnos. Unless a primary error is to be
   suspected here, the LXX. has glossed its original, from motives of
   piety. After the stanza inserts a reference to the Book of Jashar,
   which is wanting in non-Hexaplaric texts of the LXX.; cod. G adds,
   ouchi touto gegrammenon epi bibliou tou euthous . Ou proeporeueto ktl.,
   a loose rendering of Heb.
   l' 'ts lvv' k?yvm tmym. ?14. Emera toiaute oude to proteron oude to
   eschaton, a good example of a conscientious compromise between
   idiomatic and literal modes of rendering (cf. Heb.). Anthropou, bqvl
   'ys. Sunepolemesen to I., Heb. 'fought for Israel.'


   JUD. v. 28--30 [707] .

   28. ^B here omits the difficult word vtyvv ( ^A, kai katemanthanen).
   ektos tou toxikou, 'forth from the loophole'; cf. Symm. in Ezek. xl. 16
   thurides toxikai: ^A dia tes diktuotes, 'through the lattice' (cf. 4
   Regn. i. 2, Ezek. xli. 16). Epiblepousa . . . Sisara in A appears to be
   a supplementary gloss. Heschunthe (B) confuses vss pOlel with vvs kal;
   the general sense of the former is given by eschatisen A. For
   eschatizein cf. 1 Macc. v. 53; has it been suggested here by its
   similarity to the word used in B? Podes: A more literally ichne, but
   pous represents pm elsewhere, e.g. Ps. lvi. (lvii.) 6, Prov. xxix. 5.
   29. Hai sophai archousai: A, again aiming at a literal rendering,
   ?sophai archouson. On the other hand B's apestrepsen logous autes
   heaute is close and yet idiomatic, while A's apekrinato en rhemasin
   autes goes too far afield; the latter appears to be a Hexaplaric
   correction (Field, ad loc.). 30. Ouch heuresousin auton diamerizonta
   skula; so ^BA; Heb. 'are they not finding, [are they not] dividing
   booty?' LXX. seem to have read mchlq for ychlqv. Oikteirmon oikteiresei
   B, philiazon philois A; both, while labouring to keep up the
   alliteration of the Heb., miss its point through ignorance of a rare
   use of rchm? [708] ; for philiazein cf. xiv. 20 B, 2 Chron. xix. 2. 2.
   Poikilton (A, poikilon) misses the dual 'embroidery on both sides' (R.
   V.), or 'a couple of pieces,' "precisely as rchmtym above" (Moore).
   Bathe in A seems to be an error for baphe, which is found in several
   cursives; see Field, ad loc., and Lagarde's Lucian. To trachelo autou
   skula = apparently ltsv'ryv sll; M.T. 'for the necks of the spoil.' ^A
   substitutes the usual anatole for the spirited and literal rendering of
   B (cf. Ps. xviii. = xix. 7), and appears to have read vgvrtyv; cf. Ps.
   xix. (xx.) 7.

   This passage is a severe test of the translator's knowledge and skill,
   and shews him perhaps at his worst.


   1 REGN. xvii. 37--43.


   37. begins vy'mr dvd, A, Luc. kai eipen D. Ek cheiros tou leontos . . .
   tes arkou, an exact rendering; cf. Gen. ix. 5 ek cheiros panton ton
   therion. Luc., Th., ek stomatos tou l. kai ek cheiros tes arkou. Tou
   aperitmetou, repeated from v. 36 (^ ). 38. manduan (Jud. iii. 16, 2
   Regn. x. 4): + autou, A, with . Perikephalaian ch peri ten kephalen
   autou: Luc. (A), with , p. ch. epetheken epi ktl., adding, kai enedusen
   auto thoraka. 39. Ezosen ton Daueid sc. Saoul (cf. v. 38); Luc., A,
   follow Heb. in making David the object of the verb ezosato Daueid).
   Ekopiasen peripatesas (A, peripatesai) hapax kai dis, 'more than once
   he wearied himself with walking (strove to walk) in them,' reading
   vyl', as in Gen. xix. 11 vyl'v LXX. pareluthesan (Wellhausen, Driver,
   H. P. Smith). Hapax kai dis occurs also in Deut. ix. 13 (where, as
   here, there is nothing in the Heb. to correspond), and in Neh. xiii.
   20, where it represents pm vstym. Aphairousin auta ap' autou, reading
   the verb probably as vysrm, and omitting dvd. ?40. Lithous teleious in
   B is obviously wrong, and A scarcely mends matters by omitting the
   adjective. Correct, with Lucian, lithous leious. En to kadio to
   poimeniko: kadion = kadiskos, here only in LXX., and perhaps unknown
   elsewhere: poimenikos (hrym) again in Zach. xi. 15. Eis sullogen
   apparently for lylqvt ?( vvylqvt, Aq. kai en analekterio). 41 is
   wanting in ^B, and probably belongs to the same recension of the story
   which has supplied the great gaps vv. 12--31, 55--xviii. 5. 42. Heb.
   'looked and saw'; so A, Luc. Kurrakes; cf. xvi. 12, Gen. xxv. 25. 43.
   Hosei, added by the translators to soften the opprobrious kuon. En
   rhabdo kai lithois, 'in (with) staves'; kai lithois is probably
   intended to make the question correspond to the statement of v. 40. The
   next words in the LXX. kai eipen Daueid Ouchi, all' e cheiro[n] kunos
   are evidently of the same character--a "singularly vapid reply"
   (Driver).


   4 REGN. ii. 11--18.


   11. Auton poreuomenon eporeuonto kai elaloun--an interesting attempt to
   combine Greek idiom with some reminiscence of the Heb. phrase; Lucian
   abandons the Heb., and corrects, auton poreuomenon kai lalounton.
   Hippos puros, Heb. 'horses of fire'; cf. hippeus, Heb. 'horsemen,' v.
   12. Ana meson (byv), cf. Gen. i. 7 diechorisen . . . ana meson.
   Anelemphthe, Heb. 'went up'; the Greek verb is apparently repeated from
   vv. 9, 10, where it = lqch. &gt;From this passage it has been borrowed
   by the translator of Sirach (xlviii. 9, 14, xlix. 14, B), and by two
   writers in the N.T. (1, Acts i. 2, 11); on its symbolical use see the
   writer's Apostles' Creed, p. 70 f. Hos, ^ Heb.; cf. 1 Regn. xvii. 43
   (above). 12. Pater pater, Heb. 'my father' bis. Dierrexen . .
   .rhegmata, after the Heb.: Lucian omits the noun, probably because of
   the harshness of the assonance. 13. Kai hupsosen = vyrm; Luc., kai
   aneilato. Meloten, 'sheepskin,' an interpretation of 'drt (Vulg.
   pallium ) wherever it is used of Elijah's characteristic raiment (3
   Regn. xix. 13, 19, 4 Regn. ii. 8 ff.); cf. Heb. xi. 37 perielthon en
   melotais. Epanothen, sc. autou (Heb., Luc.). Eleisaie, ^ Heb.; kai
   epestrepsen Eleisaie is Hexaplaric, and wanting in B*, but supplied by
   B^abA Luc. 14. Ho theos, yhvh 'lhy. Aphpho, a transliteration answering
   to 'ph hv' ( ); in x. 10 the same form = 'phv', which was perhaps the
   reading before the LXX. in this place. Aq. kaiper autos, but Symm. kai
   nun, whence Jerome etiam nunc . 15. kai hoi en Iereicho: ^ kai A Luc.
   with . 16. ys is not represented by ^AB; Luc. adds eisi. Huioi
   dunameos, bnychyl. En to Iordane, Eleisaie, ^ Heb., Luc. 18. In A Luc.
   Aq. Th. the verse begins 'And they returned to him'; cf. v. 13.


   PS. cix. (cx.) 1--4.


   1. [Ho] kurios to kurio mou, yhvh l'dny. Ek dexion, lymyny; in v. 5 the
   same Gr. is used for l ymyny. Hupopodion ton podon sou: hupokato is the
   reading of the best authorities in Mt. xxii. 44, Mc. xii. 36, but
   hupop. keeps its place in Lc.^ev. act., Hebrews. 2. kai katakurieue =
   vrdh apparently. 3. Meta sou, mk ?( , mk). He arche seems to point to a
   reading ndyvh or ndyvt (cf. Job xxx. 15, Isa. xxxii. 8); ton hagion
   (sou) = qdsym) qdsyk); Symm. en oresin (vhrry for vhdry) hagiois. Ek
   gastros pro heosphorou egennesa se, though not quoted in the N.T., had
   an important place in post-apostolic Christian teaching from Justin
   onwards (cf. Justin, Tryph. cc. 63, 76, 83; Tert. adv. Marc. v. 9;
   Cypr. test. 17, ep. 63); in the Arian age it was commonly cited on the
   Catholic side--see e.g. Cyril. Hierus., catech. vii. 2, xi. 5; Athan.
   or. c. Arian. iv. 27 sq.; de decr. 3, &c.; Hilar. de trin. vi. 16, xii.
   8. The O.L. seems to have rendered uniformly ex utero ante luciferum
   genui te, with the variant generavi in Tert. l.c.; Jerome's 'Hebrew'
   Psalter reads with quasi de vulva orietur tibi ros adolescentiae. The
   LXX. appear to have read their Heb. text as mrchm mschr yldtyk, perhaps
   dropping lktl as unintelligible. 4. Kata ten taxin, l dvrty Aq. Symm.
   kata logon. Cf. Heb. v. 6 ff., vii. 11, 15 (kata ten homoioteta). The
   translator probably had before him the LXX. of Gen. xiv. 18; he
   transliterates the unique name mlkytsdq in the same way.


   PROV. viii. 22--25, 30--31.

   22. Ektisen me. So ^'BA etc. O.L. ( condidit, creavit ); codd. 23 = V,
   252, with Aq. Symm. Th. Vulg. ( possedit ), give ektesato--both
   possible meanings of qnh. The former rendering supplied the Arians with
   one of their stock arguments (cf. Athan. or. c. Arian. ii. 44 sqq.).
   Eis erga autou, a loose and partial translation, probably a confession
   of inability to understand the Heb.; Th. pro tes ergasias apo tote. 23.
   Ethemeliosen me, reading apparently ysdny where has nskty; cf. Ps.
   lxxvii. (lxxviii.) 69. Pro tou ten gen poiesai, a poor rendering of
   Heb., probably adopted to bring this clause into line with v. 24 with
   which the LXX. seem to have connected it. 24. LXX. overlook chvllty and
   nkvdy, unless they intend to convey the general sense by poiesai and
   proelthein. 25. Panton, ^ 'I was brought forth.' 30. harmozousa =
   'mvn,  the word being referred by the translator to 'mn; similarly
   Symm. Th., esterigmene. He prosechairen implies the reading yvm yvm
   ;ssvyv is connected by LXX. with the next clause. 31. Hote . . .
   suntelesas: Heb. 'rejoicing in the world of his earth.' LXX. seem to
   have read mschq vtklyt, as Lagarde suggests; had tvl stood in their
   text, oikoumene would have been ready at hand as a rendering (cf. 2
   Regn. xxii. 16, Ps. ix. 9, &c.). Euphraineto, reading ssyv. Huioi
   anthropon = bny 'dm; cf. huious Adam, Deut. xxxii. 8; b 'dm is
   translated by this phrase in Ps. x. (xi.) 4, and repeatedly in the
   poetical books.


   JOB xix. 23--27.


   23. Tis gar an doe; See above p. 308; the phrase is repeated in the
   Hebrew, but the translator contents himself with using it once. 'phv is
   ignored; its usual equivalent in the LXX., is nun or oun, unless it is
   transliterated (p. 324). Eis ton aiona seems to represent ld, which in
   belongs to the next verse; Th. translates it eis marturion, reading the
   word as ld. ?24. B* omits en petrais engluphenai which appears to be
   necessary to the sense; in supplying it B^ab'A prefix e, a manifest
   gloss. 25. Aenaos estin ho ekluein me mellon, a paraphrase of Heb. 'my
   Goel lives'; aenaos in the LXX. elsewhere = lm, and g'l is anchisteus
   (Ruth iii. 9, etc.), or lutrotes (Ps. xviii. 14, lxxvii. 35). 25--26.
   Epi ges anastesai or anastesei appears to correspond with l phr ?(yqvm
   (yqym, and to derma mou to anantloun tauta with vry nqphv z't. ^A
   points to lchyvt vry mklkl z't (Siegfried in Haupt ad loc.). But the
   translator perhaps interprets his text in the light of the doctrine of
   the Resurrection, which was accepted from Maccabean times (cf. Job
   xlii. 17^a, and see Dan. xii. 2, 2 Macc. vii. 14, xii. 43); as cited by
   Clem. R. 1 Cor. 26 (anasteseis ten sarka mou tauten ten anantlesasan
   tauta panta), the words are brought into still nearer agreement with
   the faith of the Church; see Apostles' Creed, p. 89 f. Para gar Kuriou
   . . . sunetelesthe corresponds in position with words which divides and
   points as vm?bsry 'chzh 'lvh, but seems to be partly borrowed from the
   next verse. ^A suggests ?vm'lvh nsv ly 'lh (Siegfried). 27. Panta de
   moi suntetelestai; , klv klyty.


   MICAH v. 1 (iv. 14)--4 (3).


   1. Emphrachthesetai thugater emphragmo, i.e. ttgdry vt gdr. Tas phulas
   tou Israel: LXX. read svty ysr'l for spht y. ?2. Bethleem oikos tou
   Ephratha: did LXX. read ?bytlchm byt 'phrth? Oligostos ei tou einai
   'art little to be,' as Heb. The passage is quoted in Mt. ii. 6 in a
   Greek paraphrase [709] which substitutes oudamos elachiste for 'little
   to be,' and tois hegemosin ('lphy) for 'thousands' ('lphy). ?3. Heos
   kairou tiktouses texetai, apparently for heos kairou hou tiktousa
   texetai or he. k. tiktouses hote texetai. 4. Kai opsetai, to poimnion
   autou were obelised in Hex. and find no place in ; the former has
   perhaps originated in a misreading of vrh as vr'h, so that kai ops. kai
   poimanei is in fact a doublet. Kurios, subject; Heb. 'in the strength
   of J.,' the subject being the same as in v. 1. Huparxousin, vysvv; the
   LXX. read ysvv, connecting the verb with the previous words; for ysv =
   huparchein cf. Ps. liv. (lv.) 20 ho huparchon pro ton aionon.


   JEREM. xxxviii. 31--37 (xxxi. 30--36).


   Vv. 31--34 are cited in Heb. viii. 8--12, q.v. 31. Diathesomai, in
   Hebrews sunteleso, cf. Jer. xli. (xxxiv.) 8 suntelesai (krt) diatheken,
   and ib. 15. To oiko bis, in Hebrews epi ton oikon. 32. Diethemen, in
   Hebrews epoiesa: the writer appears to dislike the repeated
   alliteration in diatithesthai diatheken. En hemera epilabomenou mou,
   for the more usual tou epilabesthai me or hote (he) epelabomen. Hoti
   ouk enemeinan en . . . Heb. 'which . . . they broke'; emelesa auton,
   reading glty for vlty. ?33. he diatheke mou, Heb. 'the covenant' Didous
   doso, a Hebraism not represented in ; in Hebrews didous appears without
   doso, and so AQ in Jer. Eis ten dianoian auton, Heb. 'in their inward
   parts.' 34. vd 1° has no equivalent in the Greek; ton politen autou,
   Heb. 'his neighbours' (cf. Prov. xi. 9. 12, xxiv. 43 = 28), reminds us
   that we are dealing The paraphrastic character of the reference appears
   more distinctly in the second stanza ek sou . . . Israel, which blends
   Mic. v. 1^b, 3^a. It will be observed that cod. A reads hegoumenos with
   Mt. with an Alexandrian version. Apo . . . heos, l . . . vd; adikiais
   . . . hamartion, 'iniquity,' 'sin.' 35--37. In 36, 37 precede 35. 35.
   Phesin Kurios, Heb. 'thus saith J.' (at the beg. of the verse).
   Hupsothe, reading yrvmv for ymrv; tapeinothe, Heb. 'be searched.' Ouk
   apodokimo: apod. is a contracted future (cf. p. 305); ouk is inserted,
   because the drift of the verse has been misunderstood (cf. Streane, p.
   156 f.). To genos Israel, Heb. 'all the seed of I.'; genos = zr again
   in v. 37. 36. Selenen, , 'the ordinances of the moon' (but cf. hchqym
   in v. 35, Heb.). Kraugen, reading perhaps rgs or rgz for rg. ?37.
   Kurios Pantokrator = ?yhvh tsv'vt, as almost invariably in the Prophets
   [710] from Hosea xii. 5 (6) onwards, with the exception of Isaiah, who
   transliterates tsv'vt (Kurios sabaoth, Isa. i. 9, a1). See Thackeray,
   J. Th. St. IV. p. 245 ff.; this passage is from his "Jer. b."


   DAN. xii. 1--4.


   1. Choran (LXX.), probably a corruption for horan (cf. Bevan, p. 48);
   pareleusetai (LXX.), reading yvr for ymd (anastesetai, Th.). Ho angelos
   (LXX.), a gloss; Th. literally, ho archon. Epi tous huious (LXX., Th.),
   . . . l bny. Ekeine he hemera, LXX., estai kairos Th.; Th. is again
   more literal than LXX. Thlipsis hoia ou gegonen (cf. Mt. xxiv. 21, Mc.
   xiii. 19). Th. repeats the subject with the view of preventing
   ambiguity; in the sequel LXX. (as handed down to us) overlook gvy,
   while Th. adds en te ge or epi tes ges. Hupsothesetai LXX.; Bevan
   suggests a corruption for eksothesetai or some other compound of
   sothesetai; but hups. may be a gloss upon the tamer word which stood in
   the original. Th. rightly, sothesetai. Hos an heurethe,
   hnmts'--overlooked by Th., unless we accept the reading of AQ, ho
   heuretheis [ho] gegrammenos. 2. en to platei tes ges, LXX.; en ges
   chomati Th., Heb. 'in the ground of dust' (but see Bevan, p. 201 f.).
   Diasporan kai aischunen, LXX.; diasp. is perhaps a gloss on aisch.; for
   the word see Deut. xxviii. 25. 3. Hoi phosteres tou ouranou, LXX. a
   reminiscence of Gen. i. 14 (LXX.); cf. Sap. xiii. 2. hoi katischuontes
   tous logous LXX., reading mchzyqy dvrym for mtsdyqyhrbym; Th.
   translates mhtsdyqym hrbym. Ta astra tou ouranou (LXX.), the ordinary
   Biblical phrase, used in iii. 36, 63; Heb., Th. have 'the stars.' 4.
   Apomanosin (LXX.), didachthosin (Th.). Both senses have been found in
   the Heb.; cf. Bevan, ad loc. Plesthe he ge adikias LXX., reading rh or
   rt for dt.


   The student who has gone through these extracts, or who is able to
   dispense with help of this kind, is recommended to begin the careful
   study of some one book or group of books. For several reasons the Books
   of Samuel (1--2 Regn.) offer a promising field for work of this kind.
   They are on the whole the part of the Old Testament in which the value
   of the Septuagint is most manifest and most generally recognised [711]
   , and invaluable help in the study of both the Hebrew text and the
   versions is at hand in the commentaries of Wellhausen, Driver, and H.
   P. Smith [712] . But whatever book may be selected, the method and the
   aims of the reader will be the same. He will read the Greek in the
   first place as a version, and he will use all the means at his disposal
   for ascertaining the original text which lay behind it. But he will
   read it also as a monument of early Hellenistic Greek, and mark with
   growing interest its use of words and phrases which, originating at
   Alexandria in connexion with the work of translating the Hebrew
   Scriptures, eventually became the vehicle of a fuller revelation in the
   writings of the Apostolic age.

   transliterations of Hebrew consonants and vowel-sounds are expounded by

   [698] Similarly in Prov. xxii. 10, where the LXX. read vysv vt dyn, the
   last two words are rendered en sunedrio.

   [699] See W. R. Smith, O. T. in J. Church, p. 77. Aquila, as we gather

   Jerome renders pulcherrima feminarum.

   [709] The paraphrastic character of the reference appears more
   distinctly in the second stanza ek sou . . . Israel, which blends Mic.
   v. 1^b, 3^a. It will be observed that cod. A reads hegoumenos with Mt.

   [710] Zech. xiii. 2, Jer. xxvi. (xlvi.) 10 are the only exceptions, and
   in both cases the MSS. are divided.

   [712] If the student prefers to begin with Genesis, he will learn much
   as to the LXX. version from Spurrell's Notes (ed. 2, 1898). For more
   advanced study Proverbs will form a suitable subject, and here he may
   seek help from Lagarde's Anmerkungen, and Professor Toy's commentary in
   the 'International Critical' series.

  CHAPTER VI.

    TEXT-DIVISIONS: STICHI, CHAPTERS, LECTIONS, CATENAE.

   THE Greek Old Testament, as it appears in the editions of the last
   three centuries, is divided into chapters and verses which correspond
   generally with those of the printed Hebrew Bible.


   The traditional text-divisions of the Hebrew and the Greek Bible are
   not, absolutely identical. Besides the more serious differences
   described in Part II. c. i., it not unfrequently happens that a Greek
   chapter is longer or shorter than the corresponding chapter of the
   Hebrew by a verse or more, and that as a consequence there are two
   systems of verse-numeration throughout the succeeding chapter [713] .


   A system of verse-division [714] is mentioned in the Mishnah (Meg. 4.
   4, Kidd. 30. 1). The Massorets noted the number of verses (psvqym) at
   the end of each book and portion of the canon; thus Deuteronomy is
   stated to consist of 955 pesukim, and the entire Torah of 5888. Of
   chapter-divisions in the Hebrew Bible there are three kinds. (a) There
   is a pre-Talmudic division of the canon into sections known as phrsyvt.
   The parashahs are of two kinds, open and closed, i.e. paragraphs, which
   begin a new line, and sub-paragraphs [715] , which are preceded only by
   a space. They are still registered in the printed Bibles by the ph (for
   ptvchh, 'open') and s (for stvmh, 'closed') which occur at intervals
   throughout the Torah [716] . (b) A second system of parashahs breaks up
   the text into longer sections for the use of the synagogue. The Law was
   divided into 54 Sabbath lessons according to the Babylonian tradition,
   but into 154 according to the tradition of Palestine. With few
   exceptions [717] the beginning of a lesson coincides with that of an
   open or closed parashah; the coincidence is marked in the Torah by a
   thrice repeated ph or s. The Prophets were similarly divided for
   synagogue reading, but the prophetic lections were known as haphtaroth
   (hphtrvt) and were not, like the liturgical parashahs, distinguished by
   signs inserted in the text. (c) Lastly, the printed Hebrew Bibles are
   divided into chapters nearly identical with those of the English
   versions. This system of capitulation is relatively modern, and was
   applied first to the Latin Vulgate in the thirteenth century, probably
   by Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury ( 1228) [718] . It was
   adapted to the Hebrew Bible in R. Isaac Nathan's Concordance, a work of
   the fifteenth century, in which use was also made of the older division
   into verses or pesukim.

   Of printed editions the Bomberg Hebrew Bible of 1521 was the first to
   employ the mediaeval system of chapters; the verse-division found a
   place in the Latin version of Pagnini (1528), and the Latin Vulgate of
   Robert Stephen (1555), and finally in the Hebrew Bible of Athias
   (1661). Both chapters and verses were applied to the text of the
   Septuagint before the sixteenth century; the capitulation appeared in
   the Complutensian Polyglott and in the Aldine edition of 1518, and the
   verse-numeration in the Frankfort edition of the Aldine text [719] .

   Neither the verses nor the chapters of the existing text-division occur
   in MSS. of the Greek Old Testament, except in relatively later copies
   [720] , or in older MSS. where the numerals have been supplied by a
   recent hand. But the student who examines MSS. of the LXX. or their
   facsimiles finds himself confronted by other systems which are both
   interesting and in some respects important. To these the present
   chapter will be devoted.


   1. We begin with the shorter divisions, known as stichoi, kola, or
   kommata.

   (a) Stichos, Lat. versus, is properly a series of objects placed in a
   row. The word is used in the LXX. of the stones in the High Priest's
   breastplate (stichos lithon, Exod. xxviii. 17 ff.), the pomegranates
   wrought upon the capitals of the pillars in the Temple (stichoi rhoon,
   3 Regn. vii. 6), and the rows of cedar wood shafts (trion stichon
   stulon kedrinon, ib. 9). When applied to the art of writing, the word
   signifies a continuous line of letters or syllables. The extent of an
   author's literary work was measured by the stichi he had written; cf.
   e.g. Diogenes Laertius iv. 24, Krantor katelipen hupomnemata eis
   muriadas stichon treis: Dionysius Halicarn. vi. 1126 pente e hex
   muriadas stichon tou andros (sc. Demosthenous) kataleloipotos. The
   'line' might be measured in various ways, as by the limits imposed upon
   the scribe by the breadth of his papyrus, or in the case of poetry by
   the number of feet in the metre; or again it might be fixed in each
   instance by the requirements of the sense; or it might depend upon a
   purely conventional standard. Evidence has been produced [721] to shew
   that the last of these methods was adopted in the copying of Greek
   prose writings, and that the length of the prose stichus was determined
   by that of the Homeric hexameter, i.e. it was normally a line of
   sixteen syllables; in some instances the Iambic trimeter seems to have
   been the standard preferred, and the line consisted of twelve syllables
   [722] . The number of letters in the stichus was on the average 37--38
   in the one case, and 28--29 in the other. Such a system served more
   than one useful purpose. Besides facilitating reference, it regulated
   the pay of the scribe, and consequently the price of the book. The
   number of the lines in a book once determined, it might be written in
   any form without affecting the cost [723] . The compiler of the
   Cheltenham list explains that dishonest scribes at Rome and elsewhere
   purposely suppressed or mutilated the stichometry [724] . Thus the
   careful entry of the stichoi in the margins of ancient books, or the
   computation at the end of the number of stichoi contained in them, was
   not due to mere custom or sentiment, but served an important practical
   end.

   (b) Besides this conventional measurement there existed another system
   which regulated the length of the line by the sense. Sense-divisions
   were commonly known as kola or kommeta. The colon, according to Suidas,
   is a line which forms a complete clause (ho apertismenen ennoian echon
   stichos; the comma is a shorter colon [725] .


   This arrangement was originally used in transcribing poetry, but before
   Jerome's time it had been applied to the great prose authors; cf.
   Hieron. praef. ad Isa. [726] : "nemo cum prophetas versibus viderit
   esse descriptos, metro eos aestimet apud Hebraeos ligari, et aliquid
   simile habere de Psalmis vet operibus Salomonis; sed quod in Demosthene
   et Tullio solet fieri, ut per cola scribantur et commata, qui utique
   prosa et non versibus conscripserunt, nos quoque, utilitati legentium
   providentes, interpretationem novam scribendi genere distinximus";
   praef. in Ezech. [727] : "legite igitur et hunc iuxta translationem
   nostram, quoniam per cola scriptus et commata manifestiorem legentibus
   sensum tribuit." Cf. Cassiod. de inst. div. litt., praef. Hesychius of
   Jerusalem ( c. 433) treated the Greek text of the Dodecapropheton in
   the same way [728] : esti men archaion touto tois theophorois to
   spoudasma stichedon, hos ta polla, pros ten ton meletomonon sapheneian
   tas propheteias ektithesthai. houto toigaroun opsei men ton Dabid

   houto meristhenta tois stichois ta ton Asmaton asmata . . . ou maten en
   tais dodeka biblois ton propheton kai autos ekolouthesa.


   Specimens of colometry may be seen in Codd. ' B, where the poetical
   books are written in cola of such length that the scribe has been
   compelled to limit himself in this part of his work to two columns
   instead of dividing his page into three or four.


   Among the lists of the books of the O. T. canon printed in an earlier
   chapter of this book (Part II. c. i.) there are three which are
   accompanied by a stichometry. We will now collect their measurements
   and exhibit them in a tabular form.

   The figures given above correspond to those in the lists printed in c.
   i., which follow the text of Preuschen (Analecta, pp. 156 f., 142 ff.,
   138 f.). Some variants and suggested rectifications may be seen in
   Zahn, Gesch. d. NTlichen Kanons, ii., pp. 295 ff., 143 ff., and Sanday,
   Studia Biblica, iii., pp. 266 ff.


   Many MSS. of the Greek Bible contain more or less complete
   stichometries of the several books of the canon. Either the total
   number of stichi is registered at the end of the book, or a record is
   kept throughout the book by placing a figure or figures in the margin
   at the end of each centenary of lines. Some of our oldest MSS:
   reproduce in this form the stichometry of their archetypes; in other
   cases, a stichometry which has been copied into the margin by a second
   or later hand. Thus in Cod. B, the margins of 1--4 Regn. and Isaiah
   present a nearly complete record [732] of stichi written prima manu,
   and doubtless transcribed from the MSS. to which the scribe owed his
   copy of those books. A marginal register of stichi is also found in
   part of Cod. F, beginning with Deuteronomy, and in Cod. Q, where it is
   due to the hand which has added the Hexaplaric matter. The entries in B
   and Q agree generally in Isaiah; in both MSS. the last entry occurs at
   Isa. lxv. 19, where the number of stichi reaches 3500. But the famous
   Chigi MS. of the Prophets (Cod. 87) counts 3820 stichi in Isaiah [733]
   . This approaches the number given by Nicephorus, whilst the total
   number of stichi in BQ, 3600, agrees with the computation of the
   Claromontane list. The addition of 200 stichi in Nicephorus and Cod. 87
   is due, Ceriani suggests, to the greater length of the Hexaplaric and
   Lucianic texts [734] . There is a similar disparity between the
   stichometry of Nicephorus and the reckoning of Cod. F in Deuteronomy,
   where in F the stichi are 3000 [735] , but in Nicephorus 3100. On the
   other hand the later uncial K makes the stichi of Numbers to be 3535,
   which comes very near to the reckoning of Nicephorus [736] .

   Stichometrical variation is doubtless chiefly or largely due to
   divergent types of text. But other causes of disparity were at work. It
   was easy for scribes to misread the letters which represented the
   number of the lines, especially when they were mechanically copied from
   an archetype. The older signs may have been sometimes misunderstood
   [737] , or those which were intelligible may have been confused by
   careless copying. A glance . at the comparative table on p. 346 f. will
   shew that several of the larger discrepancies can only be explained in
   some such way.


   The following stichometry is derived chiefly from Dr E. Klostermann's
   Analecta [738] , giving the result of his researches among cursive
   MSS., with some additions supplied by the Editors of the larger LXX.

   2. No complete system of capitulation is found in any of our existing
   uncial MSS. of the Greek Old Testament. Yet even the Vatican MS., which
   is written continuously except in the poetical books, bears traces of a
   system of chapter-divisions which is older than itself [745] . It
   begins with Proverbs, and from that book onwards chapter-numbers appear
   in the margin of the canonical writings, whilst in some instances there
   is a double capitulation, as the following table will shew.


   Proverbs     61 16   Zephaniah                5
   Ecclesiastes 25 7    Haggai                   3

   Amos            6    Jeremiah        100      98
   Micah           7    Baruch                   9

   The figures in the left-hand column are prima manu; those on the right
   are in a hand of perhaps the eleventh century (? that of 'Clement the
   Monk,' the industrious instaurator who has left his name on pp. 238 and
   264 of the MS. [748] ). In Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song the
   capitulation of the later hand differs widely, as will be observed,
   from the system which the original scribe reproduced from his
   archetype. But in the Prophets the corrector seems simply to have
   followed the numbers inscribed in the margin by B ; the latter can be
   detected here and there under the large coarse characters of the later
   hand, and towards the end of Jeremiah and throughout Daniel the two
   sets of numbers are distinctly visible. In Jeremiah the instaurator
   here and there breaks away from the guidance of the first hand, and the
   totals are slightly different. But the difference is probably
   accidental, and it is certainly slight; whereas in the Salomonic books
   another system is followed, in which the chapters are three or four
   times as long as those of the older capitulation.

   Cod. A is broken into paragraphs throughout the prose books, the
   beginning of each paragraph being indicated not only by
   paragraph-marks, but by the use of a capital letter which projects into
   the margin. Besides the paragraphing certain books--Deuteronomy,
   Joshua, 3--4 Kingdoms, Isaiah--retain traces of a capitulation
   imperfectly copied from the archetype. In Deuteronomy chapter-marks
   occur at cc. i. 1, 9, 19; 40; ii. 1, 7, 14; in Joshua they begin at ix.
   1 (ib) and proceed regularly (x. 1, 16, 29, 31, 34, 36, 38; xi. 1, &c.)
   down to xix. 17 (le); in 3 Regn. the first numeral occurs at c. viii.
   22 (kb), and the last at xxi. 17 (nth); 4 Regn. returns only one or two
   numbers (e.g. th stands opposite to c. iii. 20). In Isaiah, again, the
   entries are few and irregular; b appears at c. ii. 1, and th at xxi. 1.

   Cod. ' seems to have no chapter-marks prima manu, but in Isaiah they
   have been added by '^c.c throughout the book [749] .

   Jeremiah, the Epistle of Jeremiah, and Ezekiel are capitulated in cod.
   Q, and in the two last-named books the capitulation of Q agrees with
   that of B. In Jeremiah, where the agreement is less complete, the
   chapters in Q do not proceed beyond c. xxiv., a circumstance which
   suggests a Hexaplaric origin [750] .

   Cod. M like cod. B exhibits two systems of capitulation [751] , one of
   which is accompanied by brief headings corresponding in general
   character to the titloi of the Gospels. The two capitulations, which
   are represented with more or less of completeness in the Hexateuch and
   in 1--3 Kingdoms [752] , differ considerably, as the following table
   will shew:


               Marginal Capitulation.   Capitulation accompanied by titles.
   Genesis     106                       99

   Numbers      53                       51
   Deuteronomy  65 [753]                 94 [754]


   Cod. Sin. I. (x.) is divided into kephalaia which number as follows:
   Genesis, 150; Exodus, 88; Leviticus, 63; Deuteronomy, 69; Joshua, 30; 1
   Regn., 66; 2 Regn., 63 [755] .

   A list of sections quoted by Dr Klostermann [756] from the cursive MS.
   cod. Barberini iii. 36 (cent. x. or xi.) exhibits another widely
   different scheme [757] :


   Genesis     26   3 Kingdoms 16   Habakkuk  2
   Exodus      8    4 Kingdoms 17   Zephaniah 3
   Leviticus   12   Hosea      5    Haggai    3
   Numbers     21   Amos       6    Zechariah 13
   Deuteronomy 35   Micah      6    Malachi   2
   Joshua      8    Joel       4    Isaiah    43
   Judges      4    Obadiah    2    Jeremiah  41
   1 Kingdoms  15   Jonah      3    Ezekiel   21
   2 Kingdoms  11   Nahum      2    Daniel    9


   It is clear that no induction can be drawn from the facts which are at
   present within our reach; nor can the various systems of capitulation
   be safely classified until some scholar has collected and tabulated the
   chapter-divisions of a large number of MSS. of varying ages and
   provenance [758] . It is probable, however, that the systems, which at
   present seem to be nearly as numerous as the capitulated copies of the
   LXX., will prove to be reducible to a few types reproduced by the
   scribes with many variations in detail.


   The 'titles' deserve separate consideration. In the few instances where
   we are able to institute a comparison these headings seem to be
   independent. In Numbers, e.g., the following table shews little
   correspondence between those in codd. K, M, even when the chapters
   coincide.

   b.  prote optasia pros Mousen en te bato.

   g.  peri tes sunanteseos met' (?) Aaron.

   d.  eisodos (?) Mouseos kai Aaron pros Pharao.

   z.  prote plege; metastrophe tou hudatos eis haima.

   e.  deutera plege, ton batrachon.

   th.  trite plege, ton sknipon. Ktl.


   Examples occur of longer headings, which aim at giving a comprehensive
   summary or a brief interpretation. (a) The preface to Hesychius's
   colometrical arrangement of the Minor Prophets is followed by a
   complete set of titloi for the Twelve Prophets and Isaiah [760] . The
   numbers are as follows: Hosea 20, Joel 10, Amos 17, Obadiah 3, Jonah 4,
   Micah 13, Nahum 5, Habakkuk 4, Zephaniah 7, Haggai 5, Zechariah 32,
   Malachi 10, Isaiah 88. The titles are with scarcely an exception
   polemical or dogmatic in character, e.g. Hosea: a?. Eikon tes ton
   Ioudaion sunagoges, ex hes ho Christos to kata sarka tiktetai, kai laou
   to men en apistia emeinen, to de husteron epistrephei kai sozetai. (b)
   The Syro-hexaplaric Daniel is divided into ten chapters, each headed by
   a full summary of its contents [761] .


   3. One class of sections calls for separate treatment. In Part I. c. v.
   (p. 168 f.) some account has been given of MSS. which consist of
   lessons taken from the Old Testament. Few of these lectionaries are
   older than the eleventh century, and only one goes back to the sixth or
   seventh. But the choice of passages for public reading in the services
   of the Church must have begun at a much earlier period. The public
   reading of the O. T. Scriptures. was an institution inherited by the
   Church from the Synagogue (Lc. iv. 16 ff., Acts xiii. 15, xv. 21; cf. 1
   Tim. iv. 13), and there is evidence that it was prevalent in Christian
   communities of the second and third centuries [762] . At one great
   Christian centre provision was made for the liturgical reading of the
   Bible on certain week-days as well as on Sunday. "At Alexandria (writes
   Socrates) on Wednesdays and Fridays the Scriptures are read and the
   clergy expound them . . . and this is at Alexandria a practice of long
   standing, for it was on these occasions that Origen appears to have
   given most of his instructions in the Church [763] ." Turning to
   Origen's homilies on the Old Testament we find allusions which shew
   that they were usually based on the lesson for the day, and we get
   light upon the length of the selected passages.


   In Hom. in Num. xv. Origen apologises to his hearers for not keeping
   strictly to the lesson for the day: "licet non ordo lectionum quae
   recitantur de illis dicere magis exigat quae lector explicuit, tamen
   quoniam nonnulli fratrum deposcunt ea potius quae de prophetia Balaam
   scripta sunt ad sermonem disputationis adduci, non ita ordini lectionum
   satisfacere aequum credidi ut desideriis auditorum." This homily
   probably belongs to Origen's life at Caesarea [764] , and if so, it is
   clear that at Caesarea as well as at Alexandria there was a
   well-defined order of Church lessons before the middle of the third
   century. In another homily, on the Witch of Endor (in 1 Sam. hom.
   iii.), Origen complains that the O.T. lesson for the day was too long
   to be expounded at a single sitting: ta anagnosthenta pleiona esti; kai
   epei chre epitemnomenon eipein, dusi perikopais anegnosthe ta peri
   Nabal . . . eita meta touto he historia he peri tou kekruphthai ton
   Dauid . . . eita ta exes he historia en trite, hote katephugen pros
   Achar . . . exes toutois en he historia he diaboetos huper tes
   engastrimuthou . . . tessaron ouson perikopon . .  . hoti pote bouletai
   ho episkopos proteinato. On this occasion the O.T. lesson seems to have
   extended from 1 Regn. xxv. 1 to xxviii. 25, including four perikopai or
   shorter sections, which, judging from the description, corresponded in
   length very nearly to our own chapters [765] .


   The lections to which Origen refers were doubtless those which were
   read in the pre-anaphoral portion of the Liturgy in the hearing of the
   catechumens as well as the faithful. In the liturgy of Apost. Const.
   ii., the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, the Kingdoms, the Chronicles,
   Ezra, Nehemiah, Job, the Salomonic books, and the sixteen Prophets, are
   all mentioned as books from which the Old Testament lection might be
   taken; i.e. all the books of the Hebrew Canon, with the exception of
   the Psalter and perhaps the Book of Esther, were employed for this
   purpose. The order in Book viii. names only the Law and the Prophets,
   but probably the scope is the same. The 'Prophet,' i.e. the Old
   Testament lesson, preceded the 'Apostle' (the Epistle) in the liturgy
   of Antioch as known to St Chrysostom at the end of the fourth century,
   and it held its place in the East generally till the seventh [766] . In
   the West the 'prophecy' was read by the North African Church of St
   Augustine's time, and it still holds its ground in the Mozarabic and
   Ambrosian rites [767] . In Egypt, as John Cassian tells us, the
   monastic communities read two lessons from Scripture both at Nocturns
   and Vespers, and (Saturdays and Sundays excepted) one of the two
   lessons was from the Old Testament [768] ; and the West generally
   adopted the custom of reading both the Old and the New Testament in the
   daily offices.

   Before the formation of Lectionaries the liturgical lessons were marked
   in the margins of Church Bibles by the words arche, telos, written
   opposite to the beginning and end of the perikope [769] . Such traces
   of adaptation to liturgical use are found even in cod. B, though not
   prima manu [770] . Whether any of the larger chapters which appear in
   certain MSS. (e.g. the later system in cod. B) are of the nature of
   lections, must remain doubtful until the whole subject has received the
   fuller treatment which it demands.

   The Psalter obviously needed no capitulation, nor was it ever read by
   the anagnostes in the lessons for the day. But special Psalms were
   recited or sung in the Church, as they had been in the Synagogue [771]
   , and in some early monastic communities arrangements were made for a
   regular recitation of the Psalter both in public and private [772] .
   The scribe of cod. A has copied into his MS. a list of Psalms for daily
   use, in which three are appointed to be said at each of the two public
   services, and one is selected for private use at each hour of the day
   and night. It is as follows:

   The existing order of the Orthodox Eastern Church divides the Psalter
   into 20 sections known as kathismata, each of which is broken by the
   recitation of a Gloria into three stasas. The larger sections are
   i.--viii., ix.--xvi,, xvii.--xxiii., xxiv.--xxxi., xxxii.--xxxvi.,
   xxxvii.--xlv., xlvi.--liv., lv.--lxiii., lxiv.--lxix., lxx.--lxxvi.,
   lxxxvii.--lxxxiv., lxxxv.--xc., xci.--c., ci.--civ., cv.--cviii.,
   cix.--cxvii., cxviii., cxix.--cxxxi., cxxxii.--cxlii., cxliii.--cl. In
   the later liturgical Greek Psalter the cathismata are divided by an
   ornamental band or some other mark of separation, and the staseis by a
   marginal (doxa, i.e. the Doxology, which was repeated at the end of
   each) [775] .


   (1) A few other text-divisions, peculiar to certain contexts or books,
   may be specified here. In Isaiah it was not unusual to mark in the
   margin the place where each of the books of Origen's commentary ended
   (tomos a'--ls', cf. Eus. H.E. vi. 36). Both in Isaiah and in Daniel
   certain prophetic horaseis were distinguished. Thus cod. Q^mg places
   opposite to Isa. vii. 1, and at c. xvii. 1. In Daniel cod. A marks 12
   horaseis, which begin respectively at Sus. 1, Dan. i. 1, ii. 1, iii. 1,
   iii. 98, v. 1, v. 30, vii. 1, viii. 1, ix. 1, xi. 1, Bel 1, and the
   same method of division is used in codd. QG. In Lamentations each
   stanza is preceded by a representation of the Hebrew letter with which
   it begins, e.g. aleph (alph, alpha [776] ), beth, gimel (giml), daleth
   (deleth, delt, delth), and so forth [777] . In the analogous case of
   Psalm cxviii. (cxix.), there are no signs of this treatment, except in
   the Graeco-Latin Psalters RT [778] .

   In the Song a marginal enumeration distinguishes the speeches of the
   interlocutors, and some MSS. (e.g. ' and V) add marginal notes after
   the manner of stage-directions, such as he numphe pros ton numphion,
   tais neanisin he numphe, hai neanides to numphio [779] .

   Small departures from the continuous or slightly paragraphed writing of
   the oldest MSS. are found in a few contexts which lend themselves to
   division. Thus even in cod. B the blessings of the tribes in Gen. xlix.
   3--27 are separated and numbered -- . A similar treatment but without
   marginal enumeration is accorded to Deut. xiv. 12--18 and 1 Paral. i.
   51--54, Eccl. iii. 1--8. The ten words of the Decalogue are numbered in
   the margins of codd. BA, but not prima manu; and the systems of
   numeration differ to some extent. Thus according to B^a, a' = prologue,
   b' = i + ii, g'=iii, d' = iv, e' = v, s' = vii, z' = viii, e' = vi, th'
   = ix, i' = x, while A¹ makes g' = iv, d' = v, e' = vi; the other
   numbers in A are effaced, or were never appended.


   (2) It would be interesting, if sufficient materials were available, to
   pursue the subject of text-division with reference to the
   daughter-versions of the LXX. On the stichometry and capitulation of
   the Latin Bible much information has been brought together by M. Berger
   (Histoire de la Vulgate, p. 307 ff.) and Wordsworth-White (Epilogus,
   p.733 ff.); for the stichometry see also Dr Sanday in Studia Biblica,
   iii. p. 264 f. But it remains doubtful whether these divisions of the
   Latin Bible belonged originally to Jerome's version or were transferred
   to it from the Old Latin [780] ; or, supposing the latter view to be
   correct, whether they came from the MSS. of the LXX. which were used by
   the early African or Italian translators. In referring to the N.T.
   Tertullian speaks of capitula not seldom (ad uxor. ii. 2, de monog. 11,
   de virg. vel. 4, de praescr. 5, adv. Prax. 20); but it is not clear
   that he uses the word to connote definitely marked sections.

   On the capitulation of the Coptic versions the student will find
   something in Wilkins, Pentat. praef., ad fin., and Lagarde, Orientalia,
   p. 125 ff.; on the Egyptian lectionary, he may consult the list of
   authorities collected by Brightman, Ancient Liturgies, p. lxix. For the
   Ethiopic version, cf. Dillmann's Ethiopic Pentateuch, I. ii., pp. 163
   f., 173. The stichometry of the Syro-Hexaplaric is discussed by
   Lagarde, Mittheilungen, iv. (1891), p. 205 f. A list of Church lessons,
   taken from the Palestinian-Syriac lectionary recently discovered by Mrs
   Lewis and Mrs Gibson, is given by Nestle in Studia Sinaitica, vi. p.
   xxix. ff.


   4. In connexion with the subject of text-division it will be convenient
   to mention the expositions which accompany and often break up the text
   in MSS. of the Greek Bible. The student will have observed that many of
   the codices enumerated in Part I. c. v. (pp. 148--168) contain
   commentaries, either original (comm.), or compiled (cat.). Of the Greek
   commentators something will be said when we come to consider the use of
   the LXX. by the Greek fathers; in this place we will limit ourselves to
   the relatively late compilations which are based on the exegetical
   works of earlier writers [781] .

   Such expositions were formerly described as eklogai or paragraphai, or
   as epitomai hermeneion, or exegeseis eranistheisai apo diaphoron
   pateron, or sunopseis scholikai ek diaphoron hupomnematon
   sullechtheisai, or by some similar periphrasis. The use of the
   technical term catena (seira) is of comparatively modern date. Catena
   aurea is a secondary title of the great compendium of comments on the
   Four Gospels brought together by Thomas Aquinas, and a Greek MS.
   Psalter of the 16th century (Vat. Gr. 2240) adopts the phrase,
   translating it by chruse halusis. Seira is used in this sense by the
   editor of the Greek catena of Nicephorus, which bears the title Seira
   enos kai pentekonta hupomnematiston eis ten Oktateuchon kai ta ton
   Basileion. The metaphor so happily expresses the principle on which
   such commentaries are constructed, that books of this description are
   now universally known as catenae or seirai. They are 'chains' in which
   each link is supplied by some ancient author, scraps of exegesis
   threaded together by the ingenuity or industry of a collector who
   usually elects to be anonymous.

   The catenists drew their materials from all sources within their reach.
   They laid under contribution Jewish writers such as Philo and Josephus,
   heretics like Basileides, Valentinus, and Marcion, suspects like
   Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea, Apollinarius, and Theodore of Mopsuestia,
   as well as the accepted teachers and Saints of the Catholic Church.
   Their range extended from the first century to the fifth or sixth, and
   they had access to a number of writers whose works have since
   disappeared. Hence their value in the eyes of patristic scholars and
   editors. But they are not without importance for the purposes of the
   biblical student. The text embedded in the commentary may be late [782]
   , but the commentary itself often preserves the witness of early
   writers to an old and valuable type.

   The catena is usually written in the broad margins which surround the
   text, or it embodies the text, which in that case is usually
   distinguished from it by being written in uncials or in coloured ink,
   or enclosed within marks of quotation. The names of the authors who
   have been pressed into the service of the catenist are commonly
   inserted in the margin at the place where their contributions begin:
   thus , , , , , , . If a second passage from the same author occurs in
   the same context it is introduced as ; an anonymous writer is .
   Unfortunately in the copying of catenae such attributions have often
   been omitted or misplaced, or even erroneously inserted, and as to this
   particular the student must be on his guard against a too unsuspecting
   acquiescence in the witness of his MS. Nor can he place implicit
   confidence in the verbal accuracy of the excerpts. The catenists
   evidently regarded themselves as free, while retaining the substance;
   to abbreviate and otherwise modify the language of their authors.


   The following is a list of the chief Greek catenae of the Old Testament
   which have appeared in type. Octateuch, Historical books: the Catena of
   Nicephorus, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1772--3; Psalms: B. Corderii expositio
   Graecorum patrum, 3 vols., Antwerp, 1643; Proverbs: Commentary of
   Procopius first printed by Mai, and in Migne, P. G. lxxxvii.; Song:
   Commentary ascribed to Eusebius and Polychronius (Meursius, Leyden,
   1617); Job: Catena of Nicetas of Serrae (P. Junius, i.e. Patrick Young,
   London, 1636); Isaiah: Commentary of Procopius (J. Curterius, Paris,
   1580); Jeremiah, with Lamentations and Baruch: Catena published by M.
   Ghisler, 3 vols., Leyden, 1623; Daniel: Catena published by A. Mai in
   Script. vet. nov. coll. 1. On these see Ch. Q. R. i. 99, pp. 36--42.


   The nineteenth century has added little to our collection of printed
   Greek catenae on the Old Testament, and the earlier editions do not
   always adequately represent the witness of the best MSS. Meanwhile a
   great store of MS. catenae awaits the examination of Biblical scholars.
   Some of these are at Athos, Athens, Smyrna and Jerusalem, but there is
   an abundant supply in libraries more accessible to Western students, at
   St Petersburg, Rome, Paris, and London. Perhaps no corner of the field
   of Biblical and patristic research offers so much virgin soil, with so
   good a prospect of securing useful if not brilliant results.


   The following LXX. MSS. amongst others contain catenae on one or more
   of the books which form their text: H.-P. 14, 17, 24, 25, 31, 33, 52,
   57, 73, 77, 78, 79, 83 87, 90, 91, 97) 98, 99; 109, 112, 128, 135, 147,
   181, 209, 238, 240, 243, 264, 272, 292, 302, 309; London B.M. Add.
   35123, Lambeth 1214; Paris, Coisl. gr. 5, 7, Reg. gr. 128, 129, 130,
   131, 132, 161; Zurich c. 11; Basle gr. iv. 56, vi. 8; Esc. S. i. 16;
   Leyden, 13; Munich gr. 82; Athos Vatop. 15, Ivér. 15; Athens, nat. 43;
   Constantinople 224; Smyrna, Ev. sch. 1; Patmos, 216, 217; Sinai 2;
   Jerusalem H. Sep. 3. Scholia are to be found in H.-P. 14, 16, 38, 52,
   56, 64, 70, 77, 79, 93, 128, 130, 131, 135, 159, 256, 310; Paris Ars.
   8415, Coisl. gr. 184.

   On the Paris O. T. catenae see H. Lietzmann, Catenen, p. 37 ff. Some of
   the Vatican catenae are handled by Pitra, analecta sacra 11,
   Klostermann, analecta, passim; a full and valuable account of Roman MS.
   catenae on the Prophets is given by Faulhaber (die Propheten Catenen).
   For lists of the catenae in the great libraries of Europe and the East,
   the student must consult the published catalogues, e.g. Montfaucon,
   Omont (Paris), Stephenson (Vatican), Lambeccius (Vienna), Lambros
   (Athos), Papadopulos (Jerusalem). The more important MSS. are
   enumerated by Harnack-Preuschen, and Heinrici, and in the older work of
   Fabricius-Harles. A Catenarum graecarum catalogus by G. Karo and H.
   Lietzmann is in progress (Nachrichten der K. Gesellschaft der
   Wissenschaften zu Göttingen (Philologisch-hist. Klasse), 1902 ff.


   5. Besides catenae and detached scholia the margins of LXX. MSS.
   frequently contain notes of various kinds, written oftentimes in
   perplexing abbreviations. Lists of abbreviations are given by the
   principal palaeographical authorities, such as Montfaucon's
   Palaeographia Graeca, Gardthausen's Griechische Paläographie, and Sir
   E. Maunde Thompson's Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography; but the
   subject can only be mastered by working upon the MSS. themselves or
   their facsimiles. It may be useful, however, to print here a few of the
   abbreviated notes and symbols which occur in the apparatus of the
   Cambridge manual LXX., or are of frequent occurrence in the principal
   codices.

   = Akulas.   , = Summachos.   th', the' = Theodotion.

   = ou keitai par Ebraiois. = hoi obelismenoi (stichoi) ou keintai par
   Ebraiois. = homoios tois ebdomekonta. = hoi treis, i.e. Aquila,
   Symmachus, Theodotion. p' = pantes. l = Loukianos (Field, Hexapla, 1.
   lxxxv.).    = hoi loipoi. MO^N = monos.    = horaion,    or = Origenes.
   For PIPI see above, p. 39 f.

   = semeiosai, semeioteon, semeion.   GR = grapson or graphetai.    =
   arche.   te' = telos.    = stichos.   ke' = kephalaion.    = kathisma.
      = anagnosma.    = diorthotai (i.e. 'corrected thus far'), a mark
   inserted by the diorthotes usually at the end of a book. For further
   particulars see Field, op. cit., p. xciv. sqq [783] .

   [736] The numeration of the stichi in the poetical books ascribed to
   the greater uncials in the Cambridge manual LXX. is derived from Dr
   Nestle's Supplementum² (Leipzig, 1887) and rests on an actual counting
   of the lines, and not on statements in the MSS. themselves.

   [745] Tischendorf (Mon. sacr. ined. n. c., i. prolegg., p. xxvii.)
   points out that Tertullian recognises a system of chapters in Numbers.

   [746] In this book the chapter-numbers correspond to the divisions
   indicated in the original by the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and in
   the recension by transliteration of the Hebrew alphabetic names.

   [747] This number includes the Greek additions.

   [752] Another Coislin MS. (Coisl. gr. 8) gives the following
   capitulation for some of the later histories: 1 Chron. 83, 2 Chron. 86,

   [753] Beginning at c. iv. 41.

   [754] In Judges there is no capitulation, but the periods of bondage
   are distinguished as , , &c., and the exploits of the successive judges
   by   , and so forth.

   not to the text of the books, but to that of the synopsis contained in
   the MS. Cf. also the kephalaia in Hab. iii. found in Barb. v. 45 (86,
   H.-P.).

   [757] Interesting traces of another old capitulation are to be found in
   the ekloge tou nomou printed in Cotelerii Eccl. Gr. Mon. i. p. 1. The
   chapters here are shorter and therefore more numerous than in any of
   the lists given above, e.g. Exod. xxii. 1--27 forms part of the 68th
   chapter and Deut. xxv. 11 ff. of the 93rd in their several books, while
   Leviticus apparently contains 150 chapters and Numbers 140.

   [758] Paragraphs or sections marked by capitals protruding into the
   margin or written in red ink, or (less frequently) distinguished by
   numbers, occur perhaps in the majority of cursives; the following list
   of cursives thus divided is taken from descriptions of MSS. made for

PART III.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    LITERARY USE OF THE LXX. BY NON-CHRISTIAN HELLENISTS.

   1. A HAPPY accident has preserved fragments of the lost literature
   produced by the Hellenised Jews of Alexandria between the inception of
   the Alexandrian Version and the Christian era. The Greek
   historiographer, Alexander Cornelius--better known as Polyhistor (ho
   poluistor), from his encyclopaedic learning--wrote a treatise On the
   Jews which contained extracts from Jewish and Samaritan Hellenistic
   writings [784] . Of these a few were copied from Polyhistor's book by
   Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea, in whose pages they may
   still be read. They consist of fragments of the historians Demetrius,
   Eupolemus, Artapanus, and Aristeas, the poets Philo, Theodotus, and
   Ezekiel, the philosopher Aristobulus, and Cleodemus or Malchas. There
   is reason to believe that Demetrius flourished c. B.C. 200; for the
   other writers the date of Polyhistor (c. B.C. 50) supplies a terminus
   ad quem, if we may assume [785] that he wrote the work attributed to
   him by Clement and Eusebius.


   The following references will enable the student to find the fragments:
   (1) Demetrius: Clem. Al. strom. i. 141. Eus. pr. ev. ix. 19(?), 21, 29.
   (2) Eupolemus: Clem. Al. strom. i. 141. Eus. pr. ev. ix. 17, 26 (=
   Clem. Al. strom. i. 153), 30--34, 39. (3) Artapanus: Eus. pr. ev. ix.
   18, 23, 27. (4) Aristeas: Eus. pr. ev. ix. 25. (5) Philo the poet: Eus.
   pr. ev. ix. 20, 24, 37 (cf. Clem. Al. strom. i. 154). (6) Theodotus:
   Eus. pr. ev. ix. 22. (7) Ezekiel the poet: Eus. pr. ev. ix. 28 (= Clem.
   Al. strom. i. 155), 29. (8) Aristobulus: Eus. pr. ev. viii. 10; ix. 6
   (= Clem. Al. strom. i. 22); xiii. 12. (9) Cleodemus or Malchas: Eus.
   pr. ev. ix. 20.


   Several of these fragments bear traces of a knowledge and use of the
   Greek Bible, and this evidence is not the less convincing because, with
   one exception, the purpose of the writers has kept them from actual
   quotation. They wished to represent their national history in a form
   more acceptable to their pagan neighbours; but while avoiding the
   uncouth phraseology of the Greek Bible they frequently betray its
   influence. A few extracts will make this plain.


   Demetrius: (a) ton theon to Abraam prostaxai auto; ton de anagagonta
   ton paida epi to oros puran nesai kai ton ?saak; de mellonta koluthenai
   hupo auto pros ten parastesantos [786] . (b) ekeithen de , enthen
   paragenesthai . . . kai teleutesai Rhachel ton Beniamin [787] . (c)
   phesi gar ton Abraam paidas epi katoikian pempsai; dia touto de kai
   eipein Mosen gemai [788] (d) me echonta de ekei gluku alla tou theou
   eipontos, ti ten pegen, kai genesthai gluku . ekeithen de elthein, kai
   heurein ekei men de [789] . (For other coincidences, see above, p. 18.)

   Eupolemus: ektisen, hos heileto anthropon chreston ek chrestou andros
   . . . kai architektona anthropo Turion ek metros Ioudaias ek tes phules
   Dan [790] .

   Aristeas: ton Esau gemanta Bassaran gennesai Iob; de touton chora
   genesthai de auton kai poluktenon, ktesasthai gar auton men de , [791]
   .

   Ezekiel (in his tragedy he Exagoge):

   Mariam d' adelphe mou katopteuen pelas;

   kapeita thugater basileos homou

   katelthe loutrois, chrota phaidrunai neon.

   apo sethen.

   dusphrastos, , hoste me logous

   emous genesthai basileos enantion [792] .

   Aristobulus: (a) ho [793] . (b) [794] kai en pasi .


   2. Besides these fragments, some complete books have survived the wreck
   of the pre-Christian literature of the Jewish colony at Alexandria.
   They are included in the Alexandrian Greek Bible, but may be employed
   as separate witnesses of the literary use of the canonical
   translations. And the evidence supplied by them is ample. Thus the
   writer of Wisdom knows and uses not only Exodus (Sap. xvi. 22 = Exod.
   ix. 24, and perhaps also Sap. xii. 8 = Exod. xxiii. 28) and Deuteronomy
   (Sap. vi. 7 = Deut. i. 17, Sap. xi. 4 = Deut. viii. 15), but Isaiah
   (Sap. ii. 12 = Isa. iii. 10, Sap. xv. 10 = Isa. xliv. 20). The
   translator of Sirach not only recognises the existence of the Greek
   Pentateuch and Prophets and 'the other books,' but shews everywhere the
   influence of the Greek phraseology of the LXX. [795] In 2 Maccabees
   vii. 6 we have a verbatim quotation from Deut. xxxii. 36, and in 4
   Maccabees xviii. 14 ff. a catena of references to the Greek Bible,
   including direct citations of Isa. xliii. 2, Ps. xxxiii. 19, Prov. iii.
   18, Ezek. xxxvii.4, Deut. xxxii. 39, xxx. 20--all from the LXX. The
   picture which the last-named passage draws of a Jewish father reading
   and teaching his children out of the Greek Bible (cf. 2 Tim. iii. 15)
   is a suggestive one, but the book, it must be remembered, is of
   uncertain date, possibly as late as the time of Josephus, to whom it
   was at one time ascribed [796] .


   3. The Jewish portions of the Sibyllines, notwithstanding the epic form
   in which they are cast, exhibit clear signs of the influence of the
   LXX. Thus in Sibyll. iii. 312 execheas is a reminiscence of Ps.
   lxxviii. 3, LXX.; ib. 606 cheiropoieta . . . en schismais petron
   katakrupsantes is borrowed from Isa. ii. 19 ff., Lxx.; ib. 708 ff. is
   probably modelled on the Greek of Isa. xi. 6 ff.


   4. There remains one Alexandrian Jewish writer, the greatest of the
   succession, whose extant works happily are numerous and throw abundant
   light on the literary use of the Septuagint at Alexandria.

   Philo's literary life probably coincided as nearly as possible with the
   first forty or five and forty years of the first century A.D.; in 40
   A.D. he could speak of himself as already an old man [797] , but his
   literary activity was not yet at an end, as appears from his account of
   the embassy to Rome in that year. Thus the evidence of his writings
   belongs to a period just antecedent to the rise of the earliest
   Christian literature, and his numerous quotations enable us to form a
   fair idea of the condition of the text of the LXX. in Alexandrian
   copies shortly before it passed into the hands of the Church.


   The following list of Philo's works may be useful for reference. Cohn
   and Wendland's order is followed so far as their edition has been
   published.


   A. Exegetical works. De opificio mundi (Gen. i.). Legum allegoriae (ii.
   1--iii. 19). De Cherubim etc. (iii. 24--iv. 1). De sacrificiis Abelis
   et Caini (iv. 2 f.). Quod deterius potiori insidiari soleat (iv.
   3--15). De posteritate Caini (iv. 16--26). De gigantibus (vi. 1--4).
   Quod Deus sit immutabilis (vi. 4--12). De agricultura (ix. 20). De
   plantatione Noe (ix. 20). De ebrietate (ix. 21--23). De sobrietate (ix.
   24). De confusione linguarum (xi. 1--9). De migratione Abrahami (xii.
   1--6). Quis rerum divinarum heres (xv.). De congressu eruditionis
   gratia (xvi. 1--6). De fuga et inventione (xvi. 6--14). De mutatione
   nominum (xvii. 1--22). De somniis i., ii. (xxviii. 12 ff., xxxi.
   11--13, xxxvii., xl., xli.). De Abrahamo. De Josepho. De vita Moysis.
   De decalogo. De circumcisione. De monarchia. De praemiis sacerdotum. De
   victimis. De sacrificantibus. De mercede meretricis. De specialibus
   legibus (3rd--10th commandments of the Decalogue). De iudice. De
   iustitia. De fortitudine. De humanitate. De creatione principum. De
   tribus virtutibus. De poenitentia. De nobilitate. De praemiis et
   poenis. De execrationibus. Quaestiones et solutiones (1) in Genesim,
   (2) in Exodum [798] . B. Philosophical works. De nobilitate. Quod omnis
   probus liber sit. De vita contemplativa. De incorruptibilitate mundo.
   De providentia. De ratione animalium. De mundo. C. Political works. In
   Flaccum. De legatione ad Caium.


   In his exegetical writings Philo quotes the LXX. directly, announcing
   each citation by a formula such as phesi, eipen, legei, legetai,
   gegraptai, or some more elaborate phrase [799] . In this way he
   reproduces a considerable portion of the Greek text of the Pentateuch,
   as well as a few passages from Joshua, Judges, 1, 3 Kingdoms, 1
   Chronicles, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and some of the minor
   Prophets. His Greek is, on the whole, clearly that of the Alexandrian
   version, which he regarded as the work of men divinely qualified for
   their task [800] . Nevertheless his quotations often differ from the
   Greek of the LXX., as it is found in our extant MSS., or in the oldest
   and best of them.


   5. The task of comparing Philo's quotations with the LXX. has been
   undertaken in Germany by C. F. Hornemann and C. Siegfried, and in
   England more recently by Professor Ryle; and from these investigations
   the student may derive a general acquaintance with the subject,
   although even the latest of them will need revision when the critical
   edition of Philo's works, now in course of being published, has reached
   completion. The following specimens will shew the extent to which Philo
   departs from the LXX.


   Gen. ii. 7 eis psuchen zoes (LXX. eis psuchen zosan) [801] . iv. 21
   houtos esti pater ho katadeixas psalterion kai kitharan (LXX., en ho
   k.). vi. 7 ethumothen (LXX. enethumethen). vi. 14 nossias nossias
   poieseis ten kiboton (nossias semel LXX.). ix. 25 pais oiketes doulos
   doulon estai (LXX. p. oiketes estai, and so Philo, ii. 225. 20). xv. 18
   heos tou potamou, tou megalou potamou Euphratou (LXX. potamou 2º) [802]
   . xviii. 12 oupo moi gegone to eudaimonein heos tou nun (LXX. omit to
   eud. and so Philo once, iii. 184. 28). Exod. iv. 10 ouch eimi eulegos
   (so Philo, apparently [803] : LXX. ouch hikanos eimi), xv. 17 hedrasma
   eis kathedran sou kateirgaso (LXX. eis hetoimon katoiketerion sou ho
   kat.). xx. 23 met' emou (LXX., humin autois). xxiii. 2 meta pollon
   (LXX., meta pleionon). Lev. xix. 23 xulon broseos (LXX., x. brosimon,
   and so Philo ii. 152. 8). Deut. viii. 18 alla mneia mnesthese (LXX. kai
   mnesth.). xxi. 16 klerodote (LXX., katakleronome B, kataklerodote AF,
   and these readings are found as variants in Phil. i. 209. 4).


   The student who is at the pains to examine the readings given above,
   will find that while some of them may be merely recensional, or even
   due to slips of memory, the greater part imply a different rendering of
   the Hebrew, or even in some cases a different Hebrew text from that
   which is presupposed by the LXX. (Gen. vi. 14, Deut. viii. 18), whilst
   in others we seem to have a conflation of two renderings (Gen. iv. 21,
   ix. 25), one of which is preserved in all extant MSS. of the LXX.,
   while the other agrees more nearly with the Hebrew. When the MSS. of
   the LXX. are at variance, Philo inclines on the whole to Cod. B [804] ,
   but the preponderance is not strongly marked. Thus in
   Exodus--Deuteronomy, he agrees with B against one or more of the other
   uncials sixty times, while in fifty-two places he takes sides against
   B. It has been observed that in several instances where Philo opposes
   the combined witness of the uncials, he goes with Lucian; e.g. Lev.
   xviii. 5 ho poiesas; Deut. xii. 8 hosa, xxxii. 4 + en auto.

   Besides substantial variants, Philo's quotations shew many departures
   from the LXX. which may be ascribed to inaccuracy, defects of memory,
   or the writer's method of citing. Thus (a) he omits certain words with
   the view of abbreviating; (b) he substitutes for a portion of his text
   a gloss or other explanatory matter of his own; (c) he exchanges
   Hebraisms and words or phrases which offend him for others in
   accordance with a correct literary style; (d) he forms a fresh sentence
   out of two or more different contexts.


   E.g. (a) Gen. xxiv. 20 kai dramousa epi to phrear hudreusato tais
   kamelois. (LXX., kai edramen epi to phrear antlesai hudor kai hudr.
   pasais tais kamelois). (b) Num. v. 2 exaposteilatosan ek tes hagiou
   psuches (LXX. ek tes paremboles) panta lepron. (c) Gen. xxviii. 13 he
   ge (v. l. he gen) eph' hes su katheudeis (+ ep' autes LXX.) soi doso
   auten (d) Gen. xvii. 1 + xxxv. 11 ego eimi theos sos; ego ho theos sou;
   auxanou kai plethunou (Pil. iii. 161. 4 f.).


   The majority of Philo's quotations from the LXX. are modified in one or
   other of these ways. Philo entertained the highest veneration for the
   Jewish canon, especially for the law, which he regarded as a body of
   Divine oracles [805] ; and his respect for the Alexandrian Version was
   at least as great as that with which the Authorised Version is regarded
   in England, and Luther's Version in Germany. Nevertheless he did not
   scruple to quote his text freely, changing words at pleasure, and
   sometimes mingling interpretation with citation. This method of dealing
   with a source, however high its authority, was probably not peculiar to
   Philo, but a literary habit which he shared with other Jewish writers
   of his age [806] . We shall have occasion to observe it again when we
   consider the use of the LXX. by the writers of the New Testament.


   6. The Alexandrian Version was also used by the Palestinian Jew,
   Flavius Josephus, who represents Jewish Hellenistic literature in the
   generation which followed Philo. He was born at Jerusalem within the
   lifetime of the great Alexandrian (A.D. 37--8). He was descended from a
   priestly family [807] ; his early education familiarised him with the
   learning of the Rabbis, and the opinions of the great schools of Jewish
   thought; in his nineteenth year he was enrolled a member of the sect of
   the Pharisees [808] . His earliest work, on the Jewish War, was written
   in Aramaic [809] , and when he desired to translate it into Greek, he
   was constrained to seek assistance (c. Ap. chresamenos tisi pros ten
   Ellenida phonen sunergois houtos epoiesamen ton praxeon ten paradosin).
   But the Antiquities of the Jews (hai Iosepou historiai tes Ioudaikes
   archaiologias), which appear to have been completed in A.D. 93--4, form
   an original Greek work which, so far as we know, was composed without
   material help. In it Josephus professes to interpret the Hebrew records
   for the benefit of Hellenic readers: Ant. i. proem. 1 tautn de ten
   enestosan enkecheirismai pragmateian, nomizon hapasi phaneisthai tois
   Hellesin axian spoudes; mellei gar periexein hapasan ten par hemin
   archaiologian kai diataxin tou politeumatos ek ton Ebraikon
   methermeneumenen grammaton. His chief source, therefore, was the Hebrew
   Bible, with which he was doubtless acquainted from boyhood [810] .
   Nevertheless, there is ample evidence in the Antiquities that the
   writer knew and, for the purpose of his work, used the Alexandrian
   Greek version. He does not, indeed, like Philo, quote formally either
   from the Hebrew or from the Greek, but he shews a knowledge of both.

   His indebtedness to the LXX. appears in a variety of ways. (a) He
   interprets proper names as they are interpreted by the LXX. e.g. Ant.
   I. 1. 2 Heua . . . semainei . . . panton metera (Gen. iii. 20); I. 2. 1
   Kais . . . ktisin (v. 1. ktesin) semainei (Gen. iv. 1); iii. 1. 6
   kalousi de Ebraioi to broma touto manna; to gar man ererotesis .. . ti

   follows a Heb. text different from the M.T., but represented by the
   LXX.; e.g. Ant. vi. 4. 1 esan ebdomekonta ton arithmon (1 Regn. ix. 22,
   k?slsm; vi. 11. 4 hupotheisa tois epiboliaiois hepar kvd aigos (1 Regn.

   in his own words the story of the Hebrew records, he falls from time to
   time into the peculiar phraseology of the Alexandrian version. A few
   examples will make this evident. Ant. i. 1 (Gen. i. 1 ff.), en arche

   There is evidence to shew that Josephus used 1 Esdras, which is known
   only in a Greek form, and the Book of Esther with the Greek additions.

   2--8 = 1 Esdr. iii.--iv. Esther. Ant. xi. 6. 6 = Esth. B; xi. 6. 8 ff.
   = C, D; xi. 6. 12 f. = E. The first Book of Maccabees was also known to
   Josephus in its Greek form [812] , which underlies his account of the
   Maccabean wars, just as the Greek translation of the canonical books is
   used in the earlier books of the Antiquities.

   A recent examination, by A. Mez, of Basle [813] , into the Biblical
   text presupposed by Josephus' history in Ant. v.--vii. has led to the
   following results, which are important for the criticism of the LXX.
   (1) The Josephus text of the LXX. has no affinity with the
   characteristic text of cod. B. (2) In Joshua it generally approximates
   to the text of . (3) In Judges it is frequently, but not constantly,
   Lucianic; in 1, 3 Kingdoms it agrees with Lucian so closely as to fall
   into the same omissions and misconceptions; only in four instances,
   other than proper names, does it contravene a Lucianic reading, and
   three of these are numerical differences, whilst in the fourth 'Lucian'
   appears to have undergone correction, and the reading of Josephus
   survives in cod. A. These investigations, so far as they go, point to a
   probability that in these books the Greek Bible of Palestine during the
   second half of the first century presented a text not very remote from
   that of the recension which emanated from Antioch early in the fourth.
   While Philo the Alexandrian supports on the whole the text of our
   oldest uncial cod. B, Josephus the Palestinian seems to have followed
   that of an 'Urlucian.'

  CHAPTER II.

    QUOTATIONS FROM THE LXX. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

   1. THE writings of the New Testament were the work of some nine
   authors, of different nationalities and antecedents. Six of them,
   according to the traditional belief, were Palestinian Jews; a seventh,
   though 'a Hebrew of Hebrew parentage,' belonged by birth to the
   Dispersion of Asia Minor; of the remaining two, one was possibly a
   Gentile from Antioch, and the other a 'Hellenist with Alexandrian
   proclivities.' Some diversity of practice as to the literary use of the
   Greek Old Testament may reasonably be expected in a collection of books
   having so complex an origin.

   With few exceptions, the books of the New Testament abound in
   references to the Old Testament and in quotations from it. An
   exhaustive list of these may be seen at the end of Westcott and Hort's
   New Testament in Greek (Text, p. 581 ff.), and in their text the
   corresponding passages are distinguished by the use of a small uncial
   type. But this device, though otherwise admirable [814] , does not
   enable the student to distinguish direct citations from mere allusions
   and reminiscences; and as the distinction is important for our present
   purpose, we will begin by placing before him a table of passages in the
   Old Testament which are formally quoted by New Testament writers.


   By passages formally cited we understand (1) those which are cited with
   an introductory formula, such as touto gegonen hina plerothe to rhethen
   (Mt.), houtos or kathos gegraptai, or gegraptai simply (Mt., Mc., Lc.,
   Paul), gegrammenon estin (Jo.),  Mouses (Daueid) legei or eipen, legei
   or eipen he graphe (Jo., Paul), or to hagion pneuma (Hebrews); (2)
   those which, though not announced by a formula, appear from the context
   to be intended as quotations, or agree verbatim with some context in
   the O. T.

   Dan. xii. 11 (ix. 27, xi. 31)   Mt.    xxiv. 15, Mc. xiii. 14


   Thus upon a rough estimate the passages directly quoted from the Old
   Testament by writers of the New Testament are 160. Of these 51 belong
   to the Pentateuch, 46 to the Poetical Books, and 61 to the Prophets.
   Among single books the Psalter supplies 40 and Isaiah 38; i.e. nearly
   half of the passages expressly cited in the N.T, come from one or other
   of these two sources.


   2. The table already given shews the extent to which the Old Testament
   is directly cited in the New. In that which follows the comparison is
   inverted, and the student will be able to see at a glance how the
   quotations are distributed among the several groups of writings of
   which the New Testament is made up.

   Some interesting results follow from an inspection of these lists. (1)
   The Synoptic Gospels have 46 distinct quotations (Mt. 40, Mc. 19, Lc.
   17), of which 18 are peculiar to Mt., 3 to Mc., 3 to Lc. There are 10
   which are common to the three, 3 common to Mt. and Mc., 4 to Mt. and
   Lc., but none which are shared by Mc. and Lc. to the exclusion of Mt.
   (2) Of the 12 quotations in the Fourth Gospel, 3 only are also in the
   Synoptists. (3) The 23 quotations in the Acts occur almost exclusively
   in the speeches. (4) The Johannine Epistles do not quote the O. T. at
   all, and the other Catholic Epistles contain few direct citations. (5)
   Of 78 quotations in St Paul, 71 are in the four first Epistles (Romans
   42, 1--2 Corinthians 19, Galatians 10); there are none in the Epistles
   of the Roman captivity, with the exception of Ephesians, which has
   five. (6) The Epistle to the Hebrews quotes 28 passages, of which 21
   are not cited in any other N. T. writing [816] . (7) The Apocalypse
   does not quote, but its language is full of O. T. phraseology to an
   extent unparalleled in the other books.


   3. Hitherto no account has been taken of the relation which the N. T.
   quotations bear to the Alexandrian version, although for the sake of
   convenience the references to the O. T. have been given according to
   the order and numeration of the Greek Bible. We may now address
   ourselves to this further question; and it may at once be said that
   every part of the N. T. affords evidence of a knowledge of the LXX.,
   and that a great majority of the passages cited from the O. T. are in
   general agreement with the Greek version. It is calculated by one
   writer on the subject that, while the N. T. differs from the Massoretic
   text in 212 citations, it departs from the LXX. in 185 [817] ; and by
   another that "not more than fifty" of the citations "materially differ
   from the LXX. [818] " On either estimate the LXX. is the principal
   source from which the writers of the N. T. derived their O. T.
   quotations.

   More may be learnt by patiently examining the details of the evidence.
   This cannot be done here in full, but we may point out the method to be
   pursued in such an investigation, and its chief results.

   Each group of the N. T. writings must be interrogated separately. (a)
   Beginning with the Synoptic Gospels, we observe that the quotations
   partly occur in narratives or dialogue which are common to the
   Synoptists or to two of them, and are partly due to the individual
   writer. Between these two classes of quotations there is a marked
   contrast. Citations belonging to the common narrative, or to sayings
   reported by all the Synoptists, or to two of them, with few exceptions
   adhere closely to the LXX., the differences being only textual or in
   the way of omission.


   Some examples will make this clear. (1) Citations common to Mt., Mc.,
   Lc.  Mt. xxi. 13 = Mc. xi. 17 = Lc. xix. 46 = LXX., Mc. alone
   completing the verse. Mt. xxi. 42 = Mc. xii. 10 = Lc. xx. 17 = LXX.,
   Lc. omitting para Kuriou ktl. Mt. xxii. 37 = Mc. xii. 29 f. = Lc. x.
   27^a = LXX., with variants [819] . Mt. xxii. 39 = Mc. xii. 31 = Lc. x.
   27^ b = LXX. Mt. xxii. 44 = Mc. xii. 36 = Lc. xx. 42 f., = LXX. with
   the variant hupokato in Mt., Mc. (2) Citations common to Mt., Mc.  Mt.
   xv. 4 = Mc. vii. 10 = LXX., cod. A. Mt. xv. 8 f. = Mc. vii. 6 = LXX.,
   with variants [820] . Mt. xix. 5 f. = Mc. x. 6 ff. = LXX., Mc. omitting
   proskolletheseeai ktl. Mt. xxiv. 15 = Mc. xiii. 14 = LXX. and Th.  Mt.
   xxvi. 31 = Mc. xiv. 27 (omitting tes poimnes) = LXX., cod. A, with one
   important variant not found in any MS. of the LXX.; cod. B has quite a
   different text [821] . (3) Citations common to Mt., Lc. Mt. iv. 4 = Lc.
   iv. 4 = LXX., Lc. omitting the second half of the quotation. Mt. iv. 6
   = Lc. iv. 10 f. = LXX., except that the clause tou diaphulaxai is
   omitted by Mt. and in part by Lc. Mt. iv. 7 = Lc. iv. 12 = LXX. Mt. iv.
   10 = Lc. iv. 8 = LXX.., cod. A.


   Thus it appears that of 14 quotations which belong to this class only
   two (Mt. xv. 8 f., xxvi. 31) depart widely from the LXX. But when we
   turn from the quotations which belong to the common narrative to those
   which are peculiar to one of the Synoptists, the results are very
   different.


   In Mt. there are 16 quotations which are not to be found in Mc. or Lc.
   (Mt. i. 23, ii. 6, 15, 18, iv. 15 f., v. 33, 38, 43, viii. 17, ix. 13 =
   xii. 7, xii. 18 ff., xiii. 14 f., 35, xxi. 4 f., 16, xxvii. 9 f.). Of
   these 4 (v. 38, ix. 13, xiii. 14 f., xxi. 16) are in the words of the
   LXX. with slight variants; 4 exhibit important variants, and the
   remaining 7 bear little or no resemblance to the Alexandrian Greek
   [822] . Neither Mc. nor Lc. has any series of independent quotations;
   Mc. ix. 48, xii. 32 are from the LXX., but shew affinities to the text
   of cod. A; Lc. iv. 18 f. differs from the LXX. in important
   particulars.


   It may be asked whether the quotations in the Synoptists which do not
   agree with our present text of the LXX., or with its relatively oldest
   type, imply the use of another Greek version. Before an answer to this
   question can be attempted, it is necessary to distinguish carefully
   between the causes which have produced variation. It may be due to (a)
   loose citation, or to (b) the substitution of a gloss for the precise
   words which the writer professes to quote, or to (c) a desire to adapt
   a prophetic context to the circumstances under which it was thought to
   have been fulfilled, or to (d) the fusing together of passages drawn
   from different contexts. Of the variations which cannot be ascribed to
   one or other of these causes, some are (e) recensional, whilst others
   are (f) translational, and imply an independent use of the original,
   whether by the Evangelist, or by the author of some collection of
   excerpts which he employed.


   The following may be taken as specimens of these types of variation.
   (a) Mt. ii. 18, xxi. 4f.; (b) Mt. ii. 6, xxvii. 9f.; (c) Mt. ii. 15;
   (d) Lc. iv. 18 f.; (e) Mt. xii. 18 ff., Mc. xii. 29f.; (f) Mt. xiii.
   35^b. But more than one cause of divergence may have been at work in
   the same quotation, and it is not always easy to decide which is
   paramount; e.g. in Mt. ii. 15 the substitution of ton huion mou for ta
   tekna autes may be due either to the Evangelist's desire to adapt the
   prophecy to the event, or to a correction of the LXX. from the Heb.
   (lvny).


   The three last-named causes of variation need to be considered at some
   length.

   (1) A few of the Synoptic quotations are manifestly composite. E.g. Mt.
   xxi. 4 f., which is mainly from Zech. ix. 9, opens with a clause from
   Isa. lxii. 11 (eipate te thugatri Sion Idou). Lc. iv. 18 f., which is
   professedly an extract from a synagogue lesson Isa. lxi. 1 ff., inserts
   in the heart of that context a clause from Isa. lviii. 6 (aposteilai
   tethrausmenous en aphesei). Still more remarkable is the fusion in Mc.
   i. 2 f., where, under the heading kathos gegraptai en to Esaia to
   prophete, we find Mal. iii. 1 + Isa. xl. 3 [823] . Here the parallel
   passages in Mt., Lc., quote Isaiah only, using Malachi in another
   context (Mt. xi. 10, Lc. vii. 27).

   (2) there is a considerable weight of evidence in favour of the belief
   that the Evangelists employed a recension of the LXX. which came nearer
   to the text of cod. A than to that of our oldest uncial B. This point
   has been recently handled in Hilgenfeld's Zeitschrift f.
   Wissenschaftliche Theologie [824] , by Dr W. Staerk, who shews that the
   witness of the N. T. almost invariably goes with codd. 'AF and Lucian
   against the Vatican MS., and that its agreement with cod. A is
   especially close [825] . It may of course be argued that the text of
   these authorities has been influenced by the N. T. [826] ; but the fact
   that a similar tendency is noticeable in Josephus, and to a less extent
   in Philo, goes far to discount this objection. Still more remarkable is
   the occasional tendency in N. T. quotations to support Theodotion
   against the LXX. [827] Some instances have been given already; we may
   add here Mt. xii. 18 = Isa. xlii. i:


   Mt. LXX. Th.
   idou ho pais mou hon heretisa, ho agapetos mou hon eudokesen he psuche
   mou. Iakob ho pais mou antilempsomai autou; Israel ho eklektos mou,
   prosedexato auton he psuche mou. idou ho pais mou, antilempsomai autou;
   ho eklektos mou hon eudokesen he psuche mou.


   Such coincidences lend some probability to the supposition that
   Theodotion's version bears a relation to the recension of the
   Alexandrian Greek which was in the hands of the early Palestinian
   Church.


   (3) Certain quotations in the First Gospel are either independent of
   the LXX., or have been but slightly influenced by it. These require to
   be studied separately, and, as they are but few, they are printed below
   and confronted with the LXX.


   Mt. ii. 6 Mic. v. 2, 4
   kai su, Bethleem, ge Iouda, oudamos elachiste ei en tois hegemosin
   Iouda· ek sou gar exeleusetai hegoumenos, hostis poimanei ton laon mou

   oudamos] me D | ek sou] ex ou (B*)'C(D) | om gar '* ex ou | ek sou B^
   b?cAQ | exeleusetai] + egoumenos A


   On the relation of the LXX. in this passage to the M. T. see above p.
   338. Chiliasin, hegemosin answer to different vocalisations of 'lphy,
   but oudamos elachiste ei and hegoumenos hostis p. ton l. mou are
   paraphrastic. The Evangelist has put into the mouth of the Scribes an
   interpretation rather than a version of the prophecy.


   Mt. iv. 15 f. Isa. ix. 1 f.
   ge Zaboulon kai ge Nephthaleim, hodon thalasses, peran tou Iordanou,
   Galeilaia ton ethnon, ho laos ho kathemenos en skotia phos eiden mega;
   kai tois kathemenois en chora kai skia thanatou phos aneteilen autois.
   chora Zaboulon, he ge Nephthaleim, kai hoi loipoi hoi ten paralian kai

   Here Mt. differs widely both from LXX. and M. T., yet he has points of
   agreement with both. The influence of LXX. is seen in ge Z., G. ton
   ethnon, chora [kai] skia. On the other hand hodon thalasses, eiden,
   autois agree with M.T. The writer quotes from memory, or from a
   collection of loosely cited testimonia.


   Mt. viii. 17 Isa. liii. 4
   autos tas astheneias hemon elaben kai tas nosous ebastasen houtos tas
   hamartias hemon pherei kai peri hemon odunatai.


   Mt.'s version is based upon Heb., from which the LXX. departs. Cf.
   Symm.: tas hamartias hemon autos anelaben kai tous ponous hupemeinen.


   Mt. xiii. 35 Ps. lxxvii. 2
   anoixo en parabolais to stoma mou; ereuxomai kekrummena apo kataboles.
   anoixo en parabolais to stoma mou; phthenxomai problemata ap' arches.
   kataboles] + kosmou '*CD


   V. 35^ a in Mt. follows the LXX. verbatim, while 35^ b is an
   independent rendering of the Heb. The departure from the LXX. in the
   second half of the text is not altogether for the sake of exactness; if
   ereuxomai is nearer to 'byh than phthenxomai, apo kataboles introduces
   a conception which has no place in mnyqdm, and in this sense the Greek
   phrase is practically limited to the N. T. (see Hort on 1 Pet. i. 20).


   Mt. xxvii. 9 f. [828] Zach. xi. 13
   kai elabon . . . ten timen tou tetimemenou hon etimesanto apo huion
   Israel, kai edokan auta eis ton agron tou kerameos, katha sunetaxen moi

   elabon . . . kai enebalon autous eis ton oikon Kuriou eis to
   choneuterion.
   edoken A*^ vid edoka ' edokimasthen B*^ fort'AQ


   Mt. has re-arranged this passage, and given its sense, without regard
   to the order or construction of the original. In doing this he has
   abandoned the LXX. altogether, and approximates to the Heb.; cf. Aq. he
   timen hen etimethen huper auton.


   In these five passages the compiler of the first Gospel has more or
   less distinctly thrown off the yoke of the Alexandrian version and
   substituted for it a paraphrase, or an independent rendering from the
   Hebrew. But our evidence does not encourage the belief that the
   Evangelist used or knew another complete Greek version of the Old
   Testament, or of any particular book. It is to be observed that he uses
   this liberty only in quotations which proceed from himself, if we
   except the references to the O. T. in the Sermon on the Mount (Mt. v.
   21, 27, 31, 33, 38, 43) which are hardly of the nature of strict
   citations; the formula errethe tois archaiois distinguishes them from
   that class, and suggests that they purport only to give the general
   sense.

   (b) The Fourth Gospel quotes the LXX. verbatim, or with slight
   variants, in cc. ii. 17, x. 34, xii. 38, xix. 24, 36; and more freely
   in vi. 31, 45, xv. 25. In other places the author takes a more or less
   independent course: e.g. in i. 23, quoting Isa. xl. 3 he writes
   euthunate ten hodon Kuriou for etoimasate t. ho. K., eutheias poieite
   tas tribous tou theou hemon (cf. Mt. iii. 3, Mc. i. 3, Lc. iii. 4); in
   xii. 40, Isa. vi. 9, 10 is paraphrased tetuphloken auton tous
   ophthalmous kai eporosen auton ten kardian, which agrees neither with
   the LXX. nor with M.T.; in xix. 37 opsontai eis hon exekentesan is a
   non-Septuaginta rendering of Zach. xii. 10, which was perhaps current
   in Palestine, since eis hon exekentesan appears also in Theodotion (cf.
   Aq., Symm., and Apoc. i. 7) [829] .

   (c) The quotations from the O. T. in the Acts are taken from the LXX.
   exclusively. With the exception of the perioche in c. viii. 32 [830] ,
   they occur only in the speeches. A few points deserve special notice.
   In vii. 43 (= Amos v. 26) the LXX. is followed against M.T. (Rhaipha(n)
   or Rhaiphan, kyvn). Similarly in xiii. 34 (= Isa. lv. 3) ta hosia
   Daueid is read with the LXX. for chsdy dvd. C. xiii. 22 is a conflation
   of Ps. lxxxviii. 21 + lxxi. 20 + 1 Regn. xiii. 14 + Isa. xliv. 28. C.
   xv. 16 ff., which is introduced by the formula touto sumphonousin hoi
   logoi ton propheton, kathos gegraptai, presents a remarkable instance
   of free citation accompanied by conflation, which calls for separate
   study.


   Acts xv. 16 ff. Jer. xii. 15 + Amos ix. 11 f.
   meta tauta anastrepso kai anoikodomeso ten skenen Daueid ten
   peptokuian, kai ta kateskammena autes anoikodomeso kai anorthoso auten,

   katestrammena] kateskammena ACD kateskammena] katestrammena A?^bO
     opos] + an A | anthropon] + ton kurion A


   The combination in this quotation of looseness with close adherence to
   the LXX. even where it is furthest from the Heb. (e.g. in hopos
   ekzetesosin ktl.) is significant, especially when it is remembered that
   the speaker is St James of Jerusalem.


   (d) The Catholic Epistles use the LXX. when they quote the O.T.
   expressly, and with some exceptions keep fairly close to the
   Alexandrian Greek. Thus Jas. ii. 8, 11 [832] , 23, iv. 6, 1 Pet. i. 24
   [833] , iv. 18, v. 5, are substantially exact. 1 Pet. ii. 6 differs
   from the LXX. of Isa. xxviii. 16. 1 Pet. iii. 10 ff., an unacknowledged
   extract from Ps. xxxiii. 12 ff., is adapted to the context by a slight
   change in the construction, but otherwise generally follows the LXX.:
   thelon zoen agapan kai idein hemeras agathas for thelon z., agapon id.
   hem. agathas is probably a slip, shewing that the writer was quoting
   from memory. In 2 Pet. ii. 22 (= Prov. xxvi. 11) kuon epistrepsas epi
   to idion exerama is nearer to the Heb. than k. hotan epelthe epi ton
   heautou emeton, and appears to be an independent rendering.

   (e) More than half of the direct quotations from the O.T. in the
   Epistles of St Paul are taken from the LXX. without material change
   (Rom. i. 17, ii. 24, iii. 4, iv. 7 f., 18, vii. 7, viii. 36, ix. 7, 12,
   13, 15, 26, x. 6 ff., 16, 18, 19, 20 f., xi. 26 f., 34f., xii. 20 f.,
   xiii. 9, xv. 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21; 1 Cor. iii. 20, vi. 16, x. 7, 26,
   xv. 32; 2 Cor. iv. 13, vi. 2, viii. 15, ix. 9; Gal. iii. 6, 10, 11, 12,
   iv. 27, v. 14; Eph. iv. 16; 2 Tim. ii. 19). A smaller proportion skew
   important variants (Rom. iii. 20 = Gal. ii. 16 pasa sarx for pas zon
   LXX.; ix. 9 kata ton kairon touton eleusomai, kai estai te Sarra huios
   for hexo . . . kata ton kairon touton . . . kai hexei huion Sarra LXX.;
   ix. 17 eis auto touto exegeira se for heneken toutou dieterethes, and
   dunamin for ischun LXX. [834] ; ix. 27 ho arithmos ton huion I., epi
   tes ges; xiv. 11 zo ego for kat' emautou omnuo, exomologesetai to theo
   for omeitai ton theon LXX.; 1 Cor. i. 19 atheteso for krupso LXX.; Gal.
   iii. 8 panta ta ethne for pasai hai phulai tes ges LXX.; iii. 13
   epikataratos (cf. v. 20) for kekataramenos LXX.; Eph. iv. 8 edoken
   domata tois anthropois for elabes d. en anthropo [835] LXX.; iv. 25
   meta tou plesion for pros ton pl. LXX.; v. 31 anti toutou for heneken
   t., om. autou 1º, 2º; cf. Mt. xix. 5 f., Mc. x. 7 f.; vi. 3 kai ese
   makrochronios for k. ina makrochr. gene).

   In other passages St Paul departs still further from the LXX., quoting
   freely, or paraphrasing, or fusing two distinct passages into a single
   citation, or occasionally deserting the Alexandrian version altogether.
   Examples of loose quotations or of paraphrases will be found in Rom.
   ix. 27, xi. 3, 4, 1 Cor. xv. 45, Gal. iv. 30; conflation occurs in Rom.
   iii. 10 ff. [836] , ix. 33, xi. 8, 9, 26 f.; 1 Cor. xv. 54 f., 2 Cor.
   vi. 16 ff.

   The following instances will shew how far reconstruction is carried in
   cases of conflation.


   Rom. ix. 33  idou tithemi en Sion lithon proskommatos kai petran

   kentron sou, hade;


   In some cases a wide departure from the LXX. is probably to be
   explained by the supposition that the Apostle quotes from memory; e.g.:


   Rom. xi. 2 ff. 3 Regn. xix. 14 ff.
   ouk oidate en Eleia ti legei he graphe . . . Kurie, tous prophetas sou
   apekteinan, ta thusiasteria sou kateskapsan, kago hupeleiphthen monos

   zetousi ten psuchen mou . . . kai eipen Kurios pros auton . . .
   kataleipseis en Israel hepta chiliadas andron, panta gonata ha ouk
   oklasan gonu to Baal.


   The following quotation also is probably from memory [841] , but the
   Apostle's knowledge of the original has enabled him to improve upon the
   faulty rendering of the LXX.


   1 Cor. xiv. 21 Isa. xxviii. 11 f.
   en to nomo gegraptai hoti En heteroglossois kai en cheilesin heteron
   laleso to lao touto, kai oud' houtos eisakousontai mou, legei Kurios
   dia phaulismon cheileon, dia glosses heteras; hoti lalesousin to lao
   touto . . . kai ouk ethelesan akouein.


   Jerome, quoting these words from St Paul, rightly adds, "Quod mihi
   videtur iuxta Hebraicum de praesenti sumptum capitulo." Aquila's
   rendering is remarkably similar, hoti en heteroglossois kai en
   cheilesin heterois laleso to lao touto. Theodotion unfortunately is
   wanting.


   (f) The Ep. to the Hebrews is in great part a catena of quotations from
   the LXX. "The text of the quotations agrees in the main with some form
   of the present text of the LXX. [842] " A considerable number of the
   passages are cited exactly, or with only slight variation (i. 5, 8 f.,
   13; ii. 6 ff., 13; iv. 4, v. 6, vi. 13 f., viii. 5, xi. 5, 18, 21; xii.
   5 f., xiii. 6). The writer usually follows the LXX. even when they
   differ materially from the Heb. (viii. 8 ff. [843] , x. 5 ff. , soma de
   katertiso moi, 37 ean huposteiletai, xi. 21 rhabdou, xii. 5 mastigoi
   [844] ). But he sometimes deserts both version and original,
   substituting a free paraphrase, or apparently citing from memory (i. 6,
   ix. 20 eneteilato, x. 30 [845] , xii, 19 f., 26). Some of his readings
   are interesting: in i. 7 we have puros phloga for pur phlegon [846] ;
   in i. 12 hos himation seems to be a doublet of hosei peribolaion.
   Notice also ii. 12 apangelo for diegesomai (perhaps after Ps. xxi. 31
   f.); iii. 9 en dokimasia for edokimasan ( for ) and iii. 10
   tesserakonta ete; dio prosochthisa for tess. ete prosochth.; x. 6
   eudokesas for hetesas B, ezetesas 'ART; xii. 15 enochle for en chole, a
   corruption supported even in the LXX. by B*AF*.

   In the Epistles, as in the Gospels, the text of the LXX. which is
   employed inclines to cod. A rather than to cod. B. But its agreement
   with the A text is not without exception; and these are other elements
   in the problem which must not be overlooked. As in the Gospels, again,
   we notice from time to time a preference for Lucianic readings, or for
   the readings of Theodotion. It has been reasonably conjectured that the
   writers of the N.T. used a recension which was current in Palestine,
   possibly also in Asia Minor, and which afterwards supplied materials to
   Theodotion, and left traces in the Antiochian Bible, and in the text
   represented by cod. A. We shall revert to this subject in a later
   chapter; for the present it is enough to notice the direction to which
   the evidence of the N.T. seems to point.


   4. We have dealt so far with direct quotations. But in estimating the
   influence of the LXX. upon the N. T. it must not be forgotten that it
   contains almost innumerable references of a less formal character.
   These are in many cases likely to escape notice, and it is not the
   least of the debts which we owe to the Westcott and Hort text, that
   attention is called to them by the use of uncial type. They will be
   found chiefly (a) in the words of our Lord (e.g. Mt. vii. 23 = Lc.
   xiii. 27, Mc. x. 21, 35 f. = Lc. xii. 52 f., xi. 5 = Lc. vii. 22, xi.
   21, 23 = Lc. x. 15, 28 f., xiii. 32 = Mc. iv. 32 = Lc. xiii. 19, xvii.
   17 = Lc. ix. 41, xviii. 16, xxi. 33 = Mc. xii. 1 = Lc. xx. 9, xxiv. 29
   ff. = Mc. xiii. 24 ff. = Lc. xxi. 25 ff., xxiv. 39 = Lc. xvii. 27,
   xxvi. 64 = Mc. xiv. 62 = Lc. xxii. 69; Mc. iv. 29, vi. 23, ix. 48, xvi.
   19; Lc. xii. 53, xxi. 22, 24, xxiii. 30, 46); (b) in the canticles of
   Lc. i.--ii.; (c) in St Stephen's speech, and, though more sparsely, in
   the other speeches of the Acts; (d) in the Epistle of St James [847]
   and the First Epistle of St Peter; (e) in the Epistles of St Paul;
   where, though not so numerous as the citations, the allusions to the
   LXX. are more widely distributed, occurring in 1, 2 Thessalonians,
   Philippians and Colossians, as well as in the great dogmatic Epistles;
   (f) in the Epistle to the Hebrews (ii. 16, iii. 5 f., vi. 7 f., 19 f.,
   vii. 1 ff., x. 29 ff., xi. 12 f., 17 f., 28, xii. 12--21, xiii. 11,
   20); and especially (g) in the Apocalypse, where references to the
   Greek Old Testament abound in every chapter.


   5. This summary by no means represents the extent of the influence
   exerted upon the N.T. by the Alexandrian Version. The careful student
   of the Gospels and of St Paul is met at every turn by words and phrases
   which cannot be fully understood without reference to their earlier use
   in the Greek Old Testament. Books which are not quoted in the N.T.,
   e.g. the non-canonical books of Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus and Maccabees,
   find echoes there, and not a few of the great theological words which
   meet us in the Apostolic writings seem to have been prepared for their
   Christian connotation by employment in the Alexandrian appendix to the
   Canon [848] . Not the Old Testament only, but the Alexandrian version
   of the Old Testament, has left its mark on every part of the New
   Testament, even in chapters and books where it is not directly cited
   [849] . It is not too much to say that in its literary form and
   expression the New Testament would have been a widely different book
   had it been written by authors who knew the Old Testament only in the
   original, or who knew it in a Greek. version other than that of the
   LXX.

  CHAPTER III.

    QUOTATIONS FROM THE LXX. IN EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITINGS.

   "THE quotations from the LXX. in the Greek Fathers are an almost
   unworked field [850] ." So wrote Dr Hatch in 1889, and the remark is
   still true. Indeed, this field can hardly be worked with satisfactory
   results until the editor has gone before, or a competent collator has
   employed himself upon the MSS. of the author whose quotations are to be
   examined. The 'Apostolic Fathers' can already be used with confidence
   in the editions of Lightfoot and Gebhardt-Harnack; the minor Greek
   Apologists have been well edited in Texte und Untersuchungen, and it
   may be hoped that the Berlin edition of the earlier Greek Fathers [851]
   will eventually supply the investigator with trustworthy materials for
   the Ante-Nicene period as a whole. But for the present the evidence of
   many Ante-Nicene and of nearly all later Greek Church-writers must be
   employed with some reserve. In this chapter we shall limit ourselves to
   the more representative Christian writers before Origen.


   1. The earliest of non-canonical Christian writings, the letter
   addressed c. A.D. 96 by the Church of Rome to the Church of Corinth,
   abounds in quotations from the O.T.; and more than half of these are
   given substantially in the words of the LXX. with or without variants.


   The following is a list of the exact or nearly exact quotations of the
   LXX. in Clem. R. ad Cor. Gen. ii. 23 (vi. 3), iv. 3 ff. (iv. 1 ff.),
   xii. 1 ff. (x. 3), xiii. 14 ff. (x. 4 f.), xv. 5 (x. 6), xviii. 27
   (xvii. 2); Exod. ii. 14 (iv. 9); Deut. xxxiii. 8 f. (xxix. 2); Ps. ii.
   7 f. (xxxvi. 4), xi. 5 f. (xv. 5), xvii. 26 f. (xlvi. 2), xviii. 2 ff.
   (xxvii. 7), xxi. 7 ff. (xvi. 15 f.), xxiii. 1 (liv. 3), xxx. 9 (xv. 5),
   xxxi. 1 f. (l. 6), 10 (xxii. 8), xxxiii. 12--20 (xxii. 1 ff.), xxxvi.
   35 f. (xiv. 5), xlix. 16 ff. (xxxv. 7 ff.), l. 3 ff. (xviii. 2 ff.),
   lxi. 5 (xv. 3), lxxvii. 36 (xv. 4), lxxxviii. 21 (xviii. 1), cii. 4
   (xxxvi. 3), cix. 1 (xxxvi. 5), cxvii. 18 (lvi. 3), 19 f. (xlviii. 2),
   cxxxviii. 7 f. (xxviii. 3), cxl. 5 (1vi. 5); Prov. i. 23 ff. (lvii. 3
   ff.), ii. 21 f. (xiv. 4), iii. 12 (lvi. 3 f.), 34 (xxx. 2), xx. 21
   (xxi. 2); Job iv. 16 ff. (xxxix. 3 ff.), v. 17 ff. (lvi. 6 ff.), xi. 2
   f. (xxx. 4), xix. 26 (xxvi. 2); Sap. xii. 12 + xi. 22 (xxvii. 3); Mal.
   iii. 1 (xxiii. 5); Isa. i. 16 ff. (viii. 4), vi. 3 (xxxiv. 6), xiii. 22
   (xxiii. 5), xxix. 13 (xv. 2), liii. 1 ff. (xvi. 3 ff.), lx. 17 (xlii.
   5), lxvi. 2 (xiii. 3); Jer. ix. 23 f. (xiii. 1); Ezech. xxxiii. 11
   (viii. 2); Dan. vii. 10, Th. (xxxiv. 6).


   The variants are often of much interest, as shewing affinities to
   certain types of LXX. text. The following are specially worthy of
   notice: Ps. xxi. 7 exouthenema, 'AR; xxxi. 1 f. hou, ' BA (ag. '^ c.a
   ho); xxxiii. 14 cheile tou, '^ c.aAR; 16 om. hoti, '^ c.aAR; xxxvi. 36
   exezetesa (H.P. 99, 183); xlix. 21 anome, 'o ; 22 harp. hos leon, R; l.
   17 to stoma . . . ta cheile; lxxxviii. 21 eleei, B ; Prov. ii. 21
   chrestoi esontai oiketores ges, akakoi de hupoleiphthesontai ep' autes,
   cf. '^ c.aA--a doublet wanting in B, whose reading "appears to shew the
   hand of an Alexandrian reviser" (Toy, cf. Lagarde); iii. 12 paideuei,
   'A; xx. 21 (27) luchnos, a reading found in A as a doublet (phos . . .
   e luchnos); Job iv. 21 eteleutesan (for exeranthesan), A; v. 17 ff. is
   without the additions of the A text, and nearly as in B; Isa. i. 17
   chera, B , ag. B^ ab'A, deute kai dielenchth. (dialechth. C^clem), 'AQ;
   liii. 5 hamartias . . . anomias tr., 'AQ; 6 huper ton hamartion hemon;
   8 hekei for echthe, Q^ mg, 62, 90 al., Syrohex.^ mg; 9 heurethe dolos
   '^c.aAQ (see Lightfoot's note); tes pleges, B (A, apo t. pl.; lx. 17
   archontas] episkopous | episkopous] diakonous; Ezech. xxxiii. 11
   hamartolou, A (B, asebous); Dan. vii. 10 eleitourgoun, Th. (LXX.
   etherapeuon) [852] .

   (a) A few readings imply correction from the Hebrew, or rather perhaps
   a Greek text with affinities to the translations of the second century;
   e.g. Ps. cxxxviii. 8 ean katastroso, A. S. ean stroso, (LXX. ean
   katabo); Isa. lxvi. 2 praon, A. (LXX. tapeinon). Others seem to be due
   to the imperfect memory of the writer, who has not verified his
   quotations by referring to his papyrus, e.g. Ps. lxxxviii. 21 en eleei
   aiomio: Mal. iii. 1 ho hagios [853] for angelos.

   (b) A large proportion of Clement's quotations are composite [854] ;
   sixteen passages may be thus described. Some of these consist of
   citations accurately given from the LXX. and strung together, with or
   without a formula citandi (e.g. lvi. 3--14 = Ps. cxvii. 18 + Prov. iii.
   12 + Ps. cxl. 5 (phesin) + Job v. 17--26 kai palin legei)). In other
   cases one of the citations is correctly given, and another quoted
   loosely (e.g. xiv. 4 = Prov. ii. 21 f. (A) + Ps. xxxvi. 38, confused
   with 21^ b). But more commonly in Clement's conflate quotations, texts
   are fused together without regard to verbal accuracy; cf. e.g. xxvi. 20
   legei gar pou Kai exanasteseis me kai exomologesomai soi; kai ekoimethe
   kai hupnosa; exegerthen, hoti su met' emou ei, where fragments of Pss.
   xxvii. 7, iii. 5, xxii. 4 are blended into an arabesque. Except in this
   class of quotations Clement is not often guilty of citing loosely; see
   however xx. 7 (Job xxxviii. 11), xxviii. 3 (Ps. cxxxviii. 7), xxxii. 3
   (Gen. xv. 5), xlii. 5 (Isa. lx. 17).

   (c) Special interest attaches to Clement's quotations of passages which
   are also quoted in the N.T. The following are the most instructive
   instances: (1) Gen. xii. 1 = Acts vii. 3 = Clem. x. 3: Clem. reads
   apelthe for exelthe (LXX. and Acts), but rejects kai deuro with AD
   against Acts and cod. E. (2) Exod. ii. 14 = Acts vii. 27 = Clem. iv.
   11: Clem. reads kriten for archonta--"perhaps from confusion with Lc.
   xii. 14" (Lightfoot). (3) Jer. ix. 23 f. (1 Regn. ii. 10) = 1 Cor. i.
   31, (2 Cor. x. 17) = Clem. xiii. 1; here the relation of Clement to the
   Biblical texts is best shewn by juxtaposition:


   Jer. l.c. 1 Regn. l.c. [855] Clem. l.c.
   me kauchastho ho sophos en te sophia autou, kai me kauchastho ho
   ischuros en te ischui autou, kai me kauchastho ho plousios en to plouto
   autou; all' e en touto kauchastho ho kauchomenos, suniein kai ginoskein
   hoti ego eimi Kurios ho poion eleos kai krima kai dikaiosunen epi tes
   ges. me kauchastho ho phronimos en te phronesei autou, kai me
   kauchastho ho dunatos en te dunamei autou, kai me kauchastho ho
   plousios en to plouto autou; all' e en touto kauchastho ho kauchomenos,
   suniein kai ginoskein ton kurion, kai poiein krima kai dikaiosunen en
   meso tes ges. me kauchastho ho sophos en te sophia autou, uede ho
   ischuros en te ischui autou, uede ho plousios en to plouto autou; all'
   e ho kauchomenos en Kurio kauchastho [856] , tou ekzetein auton kai
   poiein krima kai dikaiosunen.


   (4) Ps. xxi. 9 = Matt. xxvii. 43 = Clem. xvi. 15; Clem. agrees with
   LXX., Mt. substitutes pepoithen for elpisen, ton theon for Kurion, and
   ei for hoti. (5) Ps. xxxiii. 12 ff. = 1 Pet. iii. 10 ff. = Clem. xxii.
   1 ff.; Clem. agrees with LXX. against St Peter, who changes the
   construction (ho thelon . . . pausato ktl.). (6) Ps. cix. 1 = Mt. xxii.
   44 (Mc., Lc.), Acts ii. 34 f., Heb. i. 13 = Clem. xxxvi. 5: Clem. reads
   hupopodion with Lc., Acts, Hebr., against hupokato Mt., Mc. (BD). (7)
   Prov. iii. 12 = Heb. xii. 6 = Clem. lvi. 4: see above, p. 402. (8)
   Prov. iii. 34 = Jas. iv. 6, 1 Pet. v. 5 = Clem. xxx. 2: Theos (ho th.
   Jas., Pet.) against Kurios LXX.; M.T. hv', but with reference to yhvh
   in v. 33. (9) Isa. xxix. 13 [857] = Mt. xv. 8, Mc. vii. 6 = Clem. xv.
   1: again the passages must be printed in full:


   Isa. l.c. Mt., Mc. ll.cc. Clem. l.c.

   engizei moi ho laos houtos en to stomati autou, kai en tois cheilesin
   auton timosin me, he de kardia auton porro apechei ap' emou.

   om en to stom. autou kai en 'AQ.

   ho laos houtos (houtos ho laos Mc.) tois cheilesin me tima, he de
   kardia auton porro apechei ap' emou.

   apechei] Mc. aphesteken D apestin L 2^ pe

   Houtos ho laos tois cheilesin me tima, he de kardia auton porro apestin
   ap' emou.

   tois cheilesin] to stomati C^ clem.

   apestin] apechei C^ clem.


   Through constant citation, the context has taken more than one type;
   Clement's is close to that of the Evangelists, but has not been
   borrowed from them in their present form, as apestin shews. (10) Isa.
   liii. 1--12 = Clem. xvi. 3--14; cf. Jo. xii. 38 (Rom. x. 16), Mt. viii.
   17, Acts viii. 32 f., 1 Pet. ii. 22, Mc. xv. 28.

   The general result of this examination is to shew (a) that Clement's
   text of the LXX. inclines in places to that which appears in the N.T.,
   and yet presents sufficient evidence of independence; (b) that as
   between the texts of the LXX. represented by B and A, while often
   supporting A, it is less constantly opposed to B than is the New
   Testament; and (c) that it displays an occasional tendency to agree
   with Theodotion and even with Aquila against the LXX. It seems in fact
   to be a more mixed text than that which was in the hands of the
   Palestinian writers of the N.T. These conclusions harmonise on the
   whole with what we know of the circumstances under which Clement wrote.
   The early Roman Church was largely composed of Greek-speaking Jews, the
   freedmen of Roman families; and Clement himself, as Lightfoot has
   suggested [858] , was probably of Jewish descent and a freedman or the
   son of a freedman of Flavius Clemens, the cousin of Domitian. Under
   these circumstances it was natural that the text of Clement's copies of
   Old Testament books, while derived from Palestinian archetypes, should
   contain readings brought to the capital by Jewish-Greek visitors from
   other lands.


   2. Whatever the history of the so-called Second Epistle of Clement to
   the Corinthians, whether it is of Roman or of Corinthian origin, like
   the genuine Epistle it makes extensive use of the Greek Old Testament.
   The following quotations occur: Gen. i. 27 (xiv. 2); Mal. iv. 1 (xvi.
   3); Isa. xxix. 13 (iii. 5), xxxiv. 4 (xvi. 3), lii. 5 (xiii. 2), liv. 1
   (ii. 1), lviii. 9 (xv. 3), lxvi. 18 (xvii. 4 f.), 24 (vii. 6, xvii.
   24); Jer. vii. 11 (xiv. 1), Ezech. xiv. 14, 18, 20 (vi. 8). The last of
   these passages is cited very freely or rather summarised, although
   introduced by the words legei he graphe en to Ezeloel.. The writer
   follows Clement in the form of several of his quotations (iii. 5 =
   Clem. 1 Cor. xv. 2, xiv. 2 = Clem. 1 Cor. xxxiii. 5; in xiii. 2 he
   quotes Isa. lii. 5 as it is quoted by Polycarp (see below)).


   3. Another second century document, indisputably Roman, the Shepherd of
   Hermas, contains no quotation from the LXX. But Ps. ciii. 15 LXX. has
   supplied the writer with a phrase in Mand. xii. 3. 4, and Vis. iv. 2. 4
   supplies evidence that he knew and read a version of Daniel which was
   akin to Theodotion's. The passage runs: ho kurios apesteilen ton
   angelon autou ton epi ton therion onta, hou to onoma estin Segri [859]
   , kai enephraxen to stoma autou hina me se lumane. Compare Dan. vi. 22
   (23) Th., ho theos mou apesteilen ton angelon autou kai enephraxen ta
   stomata ton leonton, (LXX.. sesoke me ho theos apo ton leonton) kai ouk
   elumenanto me [860] .


   4. The Old Testament is quoted in the Epistle of Barnabas even more
   profusely than in the Epistle of Clement, but with less precision. The
   writer is fairly exact in well known contexts belonging to the Psalter
   or the Book of Isaiah [861] , but elsewhere he appears to trust to
   memory, and not to concern himself greatly about the words of his
   author. Even when preceded by a formula citandi his citations often
   wander far from the LXX., although they are clearly based upon it; e.g.
   Exod. xxxiii. 1--3 is quoted in Barn. vi. 8 after this manner: ti legei
   ho allos prophetes Mouses autois; Idou tade legei Kurios ho theos
   Eiselthate eis ten gen ten agathen, hen omosen Kurios to Abraam kai
   Isaak kai Iakob, kai katakleronomesate auten, gen rheousan gala kai
   meli. Similar liberties are taken even when which he is quoting: x. 2
   Mouses . . . legei autois en to Deuteronomio Kai diathesomai pros ton
   laon touton ta dikaiomata mou--a sentence which, though it has all the
   notes of a strict quotation, proves to be a mere summary of Deut. iv.
   1--23.


   The following analysis of the quotations in Barnabas may be found
   useful. (a) Exact or nearly exact: Gen. i. 28 (Barn. vi. 12), Exod. xx.

   (v. 12), xvi. 1 f. (xi. 3), xl. 3 (ix. 3), Isa. l. 6 ff. (v. 14, vi.
   1), lxv. 2 (xii. 4), Jer. iv. 3 (ix. 5), vii. 2 (ix. 2), ix. 26 (ix.
   5), Ezech. xi. 19, xxxvi. 26 (vi. 14). (d) Free, with fusion: Gen.
   xvii. 23 + xiv. 14 (ix. 8), Exod. xx. 8 + Ps. xxiii. 4 (xv. 1), Exod.
   xxxii. 7 + Deut. ix. 12 (iv. 8), xxxiv. 28 + xxxi. 18 (iv. 7), Ps. xli.
   3 + xxi. 23 (vi. 15), l. 19 + apocryphon (ii. 10), Jer. vii. 22 f. +
   Zech. vii. 10, viii. 17 (ii. 7 f.). (e) Free summary: Lev. xi., Deut.
   xiv. (x. 1), Deut. iv. 10 ff. (x. 2), Ezech. xlvii. (xi. 10). (f) Very
   loose citation: Gen. ii. 2 (xv. 3), xvii. 5 (xiii. 6), Exod. xvii. 14
   (xii. 9), xxiv. 18 + xxxi. 18 (xiv. 2), xxxiii. 1 ff. (vi. 8), Lev.

   Sir. iv. 31 (xix. 9) Isa. xlix. 17 (xvi. 3), Dan. vii. 7 f., 24 (iv.
   4), ix. 24 (xvi. 6).


   As the Epistle of Barnabas is not improbably a relic of the earliest
   Alexandrian Christianity, it is important to interrogate its witness to
   the text of the LXX. This can best be done, as we have seen, by
   examining its quotations from the Psalms and Isaiah.


   Ps. i. 1 epi kathedran, B' (ag. e. kathedra AR), 5 hoi asebeis,
   hamartoloi, B (ag. asebeis, hoi ham., A). xvii. 45 hupekousan, ' | mou,
   '^ c.a RU (ag. moi 1º B' A). xxi. 17 perieschen, H.-P. 81, 206. cix. 1
   Kurios, R | hupopodion (ag. hupokato, Mc. xii. 36, BD). Isa. iii. 9
   hoti, AG; v. 21 heauton, AQ; xxviii. 16 embalo, 'AQ; xlii. 7 kai
   exagagein | dedemenous ] pepedemenous (as Justin, Dial. 26, 65, 122).
   x1ix. 6 tetheika, 'AQ (ag. dedoka BQ^ mg), 7 lutrosamenos (for
   rhusamenos); liii. 5 anomias, hamartias, 'AQ, 7 tou keirontos auton, '^
   c.a AQ; lviii. 5 legei Kurios, Q, 6 idou haute he nesteia hen; 1xi. i
   tapeinois, ' ; lxvi. 1 he de ge, 'AQ | he (for kai 2º), 'A.


   The leaning in Isaiah towards the text of Q especially when found in
   company with A or 'A, is noteworthy, and it is worth mentioning that in
   Zech. xiii. 7, where the text of Barnabas does not seem to have been
   influenced by the Gospels, it agrees with A in adding tes poimnes.
   Occasionally the text used by Barnabas seems to have been revised from
   the Heb.; e.g. in Jer. ii. 12 exeste, ephrixen become ekstethi,
   phrixato in accordance with M.T.; in Gen. ii. 2 Barnabas has with M.T.
   en te hemera te ebdome where the LXX. read e. t. he. te hekte [862] .


   5. The Asiatic Christian writers of the second century, Ignatius of
   Antioch and Polycarp of Smyrna, afford a striking contrast to Clement
   of Rome and Barnabas of Alexandria, in the rarity of their appeals to
   the Old Testament. (a) The genuine Epistles of Ignatius quote it only
   twice with a formula citandi (Prov. iii. 34 = Eph. v. 3, xviii. 17 =
   Magn. xii. 1); two or three allusions (Ps. xxxii. 9 = Eph. xv. 1, Isa.
   v. 26 = Smyrn, i. 2, lii. 5 = Trall. viii. 2) complete the instances of
   a direct use of the LXX. by this writer. When he quotes or alludes, he
   is fairly close to the LXX., unless we may except the last instance,
   where di humas dia pantos to onoma mou blasphemeitai en tois ethnesin
   appears to be changed into ouai di hou epi mataioteti to onoma mou epi
   tinon blasphemeitai--a form which occurs also in Pseudo-Clement (2 Cor.
   xiii. 2) and Polycarp (Phil. x. 3) [863] . (b) Polycarp is no less
   sparing in his references to the O. T. than Ignatius. He quotes only
   Isa. lii. 5 [864] (x. 3), Tob. iv. 10 = xii. 9 (x. 2), Ps. iv. 5 (xii.
   1)--the last-named passage perhaps indirectly, from Eph. iv. 26--and
   Prov. iii. 4 (vi. 1). In Phil. vi. 1 there is an allusion to Ezech.
   xxxiv. 4, from which it may be gathered that Polycarp read there
   epistrepsate, with cod. A.


   6. Irenaeus may be taken next, for though he belonged to the next
   generation and his literary activity was connected with the West, his
   copies of the Old Testament writings were doubtless of Asiatic
   provenance. His method of quotation however differs widely from that of
   the earlier writers. He is a theologian and a controversialist, and he
   quotes the Scriptures to refute an antagonist or to support the
   traditional faith. Accordingly his citations are, with few exceptions,
   either exact extracts, or but slightly abridged and adapted, and he is
   almost wholly free from the habit of loose paraphrase. How copiously he
   cites, especially in Adv. haereses iii. iv., will appear from the
   following list [865] .

   The Latin version, in which the greater part of these quotations are
   clothed, appears to be exact where it can be tested (cf. e.g. Isa.
   xlvi. 9 (i. 5. 4), xlviii. 22 (i. 16. 3), Dan. xii. 9 (i. 19. 2)).
   Assuming that it is so throughout, it is obvious that in Irenaeus we
   have an important witness to the LXX. text of the second century. The
   following variants taken from Books iii., iv., will shew the general
   tendencies of his text:


   Gen. xlix. 10 cui repositum est (M^ mg ho apokeitai [866] ); 18 in
   salutem tuam sustinui te, Domine (cf. F^ corr mg ap. Field). Exod. xxv.
   40 facies omnia (F poieseis panta, Luc.) secundum typum eorum quae
   vidisti. Num. xxiv. 17 surget dux in Israel (cf. Heb. skt, S. skeptron;
   LXX. anthropos ex I.). Deut. v. 22 (19) scripsit ea in duabus tabulis
   lapideis (+ lithinas B^ abA Luc.); xxxii. 6 et fecit te et creavit te
   (+ kai ektisen se AF, + kai eplasen se Luc.). 1 Regn. xv. 22 auditus
   bonus super sacrificium (agathe Luc.). Ps. xxxix. 7 aures autem
   perfecisti mihi (possibly a correction from the Gallican Psalter, but a
   few cursives read after the Heb. otia or ota); xliv. 17 facti sunt tibi
   filii (B^ bART egenethesan, ag. B ' egenn.); xlix. 10 bestiae terrae
   (agrou '^ c.aA, drumou B' ), o15 in die tribulationis tuae (thlipseos
   sou '^ c.aAR); ci. 27 mutabis eos (allaxeis ' , helixeis B('^
   c.a)AR(T)); cix. i suppedaneum pedum tuorum (hupopodion, not hupokato);
   cxiii. 11 om. en tois ouranois (with '^ c.aAT). Mic. vii. 19 ipse

   iustificate viduam (cheran B^ a.b'AG ag. chera B Q ); xi. 4 arguet

   om. kai sosei hemas . . . hupemeinamen auto (with 'AQ , a hexaplaric
   addition, cf. Field, ad loc.); xxix. 13 populus hic labiis me honorat
   (om. with 'AQ en to stomati autou kai en); x1iii. 23 non servisti mihi
   in sacrificiis = ou[de] edouleusas moi en tais thusiais [sou] '^ c.a
   (AG), fecisti in (cf. A* ); lxv. i qui me non quaerunt (zetousin 'AQ,
   ag. eperotosin B). Jer. xliii. 31 inferam super eos (autous 'AQ , ag.
   auton BQ^ corr), locutus sum super eos (ep' autous AQ, pros aut. B').
   Bar. v. 2 laetitiae (LXX. dikaiosunes).


   A special interest attaches to Irenaeus' extracts from Daniel [867] .
   For the most part they follow the version of Theodotion quite closely,
   even in the Greek additions. Two exceptions are worth noting: Dan. vii.
   10 is quoted by Irenaeus as it is by Clement of Rome, in a form which
   agrees with neither LXX. nor Th.; Dan. xii. 9 is cited in the form
   Apotreche, Daniel; houtoi gar hoi logoi empephragmenoi eisin, heos hoi
   sunientes suniosi kai hoi leukoi leukanthosi, where apotreche is a LXX.
   reading, whilst empephragmenoi is from Th. and the rest of the sentence
   seems to be suggested by his version (cf. heos . . . ekleukanthosin,
   Th.). This quotation however is professedly taken from a Valentinian
   source, which may account for its freedom.


   7. Like Irenaeus, Justin quotes profusely, and his aim as an apologist
   and a controversialist compels him to cite his documents with some
   regard to verbal accuracy. For the criticism of the LXX. his writings
   afford even richer materials than those of Irenaeus, since his subject
   leads him, especially in the Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, to quote
   long extracts without break or interpolated matter; more than once an
   entire Psalm, or a passage exceeding in length one of our modern
   chapters, is copied into his pages, presumably as it stood in his text
   of the Greek Old Testament.

   been taken only of his undoubted writings. A. = the First Apology, D. =

   From the circumstances of Justin's life we are prepared to find in his
   writings an eclectic text of the LXX. Of Palestinian birth but of Greek
   parentage, he seems to have divided his maturer life between Ephesus
   and Rome; and each of these associations may have supplied textual
   peculiarities. The general result may be gathered from a few specimens
   of the readings exhibited by Justin's longer extracts from the O.T.

   To shew Justin's relation to the two recensions of Daniel, it is
   necessary to place some verses side by side with the corresponding
   contexts of the LXX. and Theodotion [869] .

   The student will notice that Justin's O.T. text is a mixed one. (a) In
   Genesis it contains many readings of D or DE where those later uncials
   depart from A; (b) in Deuteronomy it occasionally supports A or AF
   against B, and (c) in the Psalms the group ART, with the concurrence
   sometimes of ' , sometimes of '^ c.a; (d) in the Prophets it not seldom
   agrees with Q (AQ, 'AQ). In the Minor Prophets it is startling to find
   in Justin more than one rendering which is attributed to Symmachus; and
   as it is in the highest degree improbable that his text has been
   altered from the text of Symmachus, or at a later time from a
   Hexaplaric copy of the LXX., we are led to the conclusion that these
   readings belong to an older version or recension from which both Justin
   and Symmachus drew. It is at least possible that many of the readings
   in which Justin appears to stand alone may be attributable to the same
   origin.

   Justin's Daniel text requires separate notice. It will be seen to be in
   fundamental agreement with the LXX., but not without a fair number of
   Theodotion's readings. Eleitourgoun meets us here, as in Clement of
   Rome, and the phrases ta loipa theria metestathe tes arches, meta ton
   nephelon erchomenos, heos tou palaiou, prosegagon auton, are
   undoubtedly due to Theodotion, or rather to the version on which he
   worked. On the other hand echon peribolen, to trichoma, pur phlegon,
   apetumpanisthe, chronos zoes, hoi parestekotes, and the whole of v. 14
   as clearly belong to the Chigi text. That this mixture is not due to an
   eclectic taste or a fickle memory is clear from the fact that the same
   text meets us in the Latin version of the passage as given by
   Tertullian [870] .

   In a few instances Justin shews a disposition to criticise the LXX.
   reading. E.g. in Ps. lxxxi. (lxxxii.) 7, he probably proposed to read
   hos anthropos (k?'dm) for hos anthropoi [871] . Similarly in Deut.
   xxxii. 8 he realises that the LXX. has substituted angelon theou for
   bnyysr'l? [872] . He maintains that in Gen. xlix. 10 the reading of the
   LXX. is heos an elthe ho apokeitai, though according to the Jewish
   interpreters of his time the words should rather be rendered heos an e.
   ta apokeimena auto. His text of the LXX. contained some remarkable
   interpolations; thus he quotes Ps. xcv. (xcvi.) 10^ a in the form ho
   kurios ebasileusen apo tou xulou [873] , and ascribes to Jeremiah the
   words emnesthe de kurios ho theos apo Israel ton nekron autou ton
   kakoimemenon eis gen chomatos, kai katebe pros autous euangelisasthai
   autois to soterion autou [874] . He cites also some words which appear
   to have found a place in his copy after 2 Esdr. vi. 21: kai eipen
   Esdras to lao Touto to pascha ho soter hemon kai he kataphuge hemon;
   kai ean dianoethete kai anabe humon epi ten kardian hoti Mellomen auton
   tapeinoun en semeio, kai meta tauta elpisomen (? elpisete) ep' auton,
   ou me eremothe ho popos houtos eis hapanta chronon, legei ho theos ton
   dunameon; ean de me pisteusete auto mede eisakousete tou kerugmatos
   autou, esesthe epicharma tois ethnesi [875] . These passages appear to
   be of Christian origin, yet Justin is so sure of their genuineness that
   he accuses the Jews of having removed them from their copies.


   8. Hippolytus of Portus, as we learn from the inscription on the chair
   of his statue and from other ancient sources, was the author of a large
   number of Biblical commentaries [876] . These included works on the
   Hexaemeron and its sequel (ta meta ten hexaemeron); on Exodus, and
   portions of Numbers and Samuel; on the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
   and Song of Songs; on Zechariah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, parts of Ezekiel,
   and the Book of Daniel. Of these exegetical works there remains only
   the commentary on Daniel [877] , with fragments of most of the rest.
   The great treatise Adversus omnes haereses yields but little in the way
   of Scriptural quotations [878] , but the minor theological works
   collected by Lagarde [879] supply a considerable number of fairly long
   extracts from the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and the Prophets. The text of
   the LXX. which is exhibited in these passages is often of much
   interest, as a few specimens will shew.

   The text of Hippolytus, it will be seen, like most of the patristic
   texts, leans slightly to AF in the Pentateuch, ' or '^ c.a in the
   poetical books, and AQ in the Prophets. At the same time it is full of
   surprises, and often stands quite alone among existing witnesses.


   9. Our last witness is Clement of Alexandria. Clement had learnt the
   Christian faith during his early travels in Asia Minor and Magna
   Graecia, and he may have received copies of O.T. writings from his
   first Christian masters. Hence it must not be too hastily assumed that
   the text of his O.T. quotations is purely Alexandrian. On the other
   hand it is reasonable to suppose that during the period of his literary
   activity he was familiar with the Alexandrian text and used it when he
   quoted from his MS. On the whole therefore we may expect his quotations
   to be fairly representative of the Biblical text current at Alexandria
   during the generation preceding the compilation of the Hexapla.

   Clement quotes both the Jewish and the Christian scriptures profusely,
   but his extracts seldom extend beyond two or three verses, and are
   often broken by comments or copied with considerable freedom. His
   purpose was didactic and not polemical; even in the logos protreptikos
   he aims to persuade rather than to compel assent, whilst the Paedagogus
   and the Stromateis are addressed exclusively to persons under
   instruction, to whom the Scriptures were a familiar text-book. Hence he
   is exact only when verbal precision is necessary; often it is
   sufficient for his purpose to work into his argument a few words from a
   Scriptural context, giving the sense of the rest in his own words.
   Still it is possible even in these broken references to catch glimpses
   of the text which lay before him, and in the dearth of early Christian
   literature emanating from Alexandria, these are of no little value to
   the student of the Greek Bible [880] . A generally full and accurate
   index of Clement's Biblical quotations will be found in the edition of
   Potter; here it must suffice to give some specimens of the text which
   they exhibit in the Pentateuch, the poetical books, and the Prophets.

   10. This examination has been but partial, even within the narrow field
   to which it was limited. It has dealt only with direct quotations, and
   in the case of Hippolytus and Clement of Alexandria, only with a few of
   these. Moreover, the student who wishes to examine the whole of the
   evidence must not limit himself to the few great writers who have been
   named. Even if he adds the writings of Aristides, Tatian, Athenagoras,
   Theophilus, and the anonymous Teaching and Epistle to Diognetus, there
   will still remain the fragments collected in the Relliquiae Sacrae and
   by the researches of Pitra, and the Pseudo-Clementine, apocryphal, and
   Gnostic literature of the second century. Still more important help may
   be obtained from Latin Christian writers who quote the O.T. in the Old
   Latin version, e.g. Cyprian, Lucifer, Vigilius of Thapsus, the Donatist
   Tyconius, and the author of the Speculum [881] . This part of the
   evidence was collected for Holmes and Parsons, and will be presented in
   a more permanent form, if not at so much length, in the apparatus of
   the larger Septuagint.

   Much useful and interesting work might be done by following the lines
   of Dr Hatch's attempt to collect and compare the early evidence in
   reference to particular texts and constantly recurring extracts from
   the LXX. [882] Perhaps however it would be expedient to limit such an
   investigation to post-apostolic Christian writers, and to carry it
   beyond Justin. Moreover, Dr Hatch's proposal to estimate the value of
   MSS., "according as they do or do not agree with such early
   quotations," seems to be at least precarious. It is conceivable and
   even probable that the peculiarities of early patristic quotations may
   be partly due to corruption incident upon the process of citing,
   whether from memory or from a MS.; and for various other reasons the
   text of a fourth century MS. may on the whole present a purer text than
   that which appears in a second century writing. This point, however,
   must be reserved for fuller consideration in a later chapter [883] .


   11. With Origen the science of Christian Biblical criticism and
   hermeneutics may be said to have begun. In the Old Testament his
   interest was peculiarly strong; it supplied him with the amplest
   opportunities of exercising his skill in allegorical interpretation;
   and his knowledge both of the original and of the Greek versions
   prepared him to deal with the difficulties of his text. Unhappily there
   is no class of his writings which has suffered so severely. Of his
   great commentaries on the Old Testament, only fragments have survived;
   and the Homilies, with the exception of one on the Witch of Endor, and
   nineteen on the book of Jeremiah, have reached us only in the Latin
   translations of Rufinus and Jerome. But even fragments and versions of
   Origen are precious, and the following list of his O.T. remains [884]
   may be of service to the student of the LXX.


   Genesis. Fragments of Commentary (t. i., iii.), and notes from catenae.
   Homilies (17) in Latin, tr. by Rufinus. Exodus. Fragments of
   Commentary, and notes. Homilies (13) in Latin, tr. by Rufinus.

   tr. by Rufinus. Numbers. Notes from catenae. Homilies (28) in Latin,

   and notes from catenae, &c. Homilies (26) in Latin, tr. by Rufinus.
   Judges. Notes from catenae. Homilies (9) in Latin, tr. by Rufinus.
   Ruth. A note on Ruth i. 4. 1--4 Kingdoms. Homily huper tes
   engastrimuthou. Fragments. Homily in Latin on 1 Regn. i. ff. Psalms.
   Fragments of the Commentaries and Homilies; notes from catenae.

   Proverbs. Fragments and notes, Greek and Latin. Ecclesiastes. Notes
   from catenae. Canticles. Fragments and notes. Homilies (2) in Latin,
   tr. by Jerome. Commentary (prol., tt. i.--iv.) in Latin, tr. by
   Rufinus. Job. Notes from catenae. Fragment of a Homily, in Latin. The
   xii. Prophets. Fragment on Hosea xii. (in Philocal. 8). Isaiah.
   Fragments (2) of the Commentaries, in Latin. Homilies (9) in Latin, tr.
   by Jerome. Jeremiah. Homilies (19) in Greek, and notes from catenae.
   Homilies (2) in Latin, tr. by Jerome. Lamentations. Notes from catenae.
   Ezekiel. Fragments, and notes from catenae. Homilies (14) in Latin, tr.
   by Jerome.


   12. It is impossible within the limits of an Introduction to enumerate
   all the ecclesiastical writers who during the golden age of patristic
   literature quoted or commented upon the Greek Old Testament. But the
   student who is not a specialist in this field may be glad to have
   before him the names and dates of the principal Greek Fathers, with
   some notice of such of their extant works as are concerned with O.T.
   exegesis. The Roman numerals in brackets direct him to the volumes of
   Migne's Patrologia Graeca, in which the authors are to be found; in the
   case of a few writings which are not included in the Patrologia and
   some others, references are given to other editions.

  CHAPTER IV.

    THE GREEK VERSIONS AS AIDS TO BIBLICAL STUDY.

   I. No question can arise as to the greatness of the place occupied by
   the Alexandrian Version in the religious life of the first six
   centuries of its history. The Septuagint was the Bible of the
   Hellenistic Jew, not only in Egypt and Palestine, but throughout
   Western Asia and Europe. It created a language of religion which lent
   itself readily to the service of Christianity and became one of the
   most important allies of the Gospel. It provided the Greek-speaking
   Church with an authorised translation of the Old Testament, and when
   Christian missions advanced beyond the limits of Hellenism, it served
   as a basis for fresh translations into the vernacular [886] .

   The Septuagint has long ceased to fulfil these or any similar
   functions. In the West, after the fourth century, its influence receded
   before the spread of the Latin Vulgate; in the East, where it is still
   recited by the Orthodox Church in the ecclesiastical offices, it lost
   much of its influence over the thought and life of the people. On the
   other hand, this most ancient of Biblical versions possesses a new and
   increasing importance in the field of Biblical study. It is seen to be
   valuable alike to the textual critic and to the expositor, and its
   services are welcomed by students both of the Old Testament and of the
   New.


   A. As the oldest version of the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint claims
   especial attention from Old Testament scholars. It represents a text
   and, to some extent, an interpretation earlier than any which can be
   obtained from other sources.


   1. (a) The printed Hebrew Bibles give on the whole the Massoretic text,
   i.e. a text which has passed through the hands of the Massorets, a
   succession of Jewish scholars who endeavoured to give permanence to the
   traditional type.


   Massora (msvrt, msvrh, traditio) is already mentioned in the saying of
   R. Akiba, Pirqe Aboth, iii. 20  msvrh syyg ltvrh, 'tradition is a fence
   to the Law' [887] ; but the word is used there in reference to halachic
   rather than to textual tradition. It is probable, however, that Akiba
   and his contemporaries were concerned with the settling of the text
   which later generations protected by the 'Massora' technically so
   called. The work of the Massorets (vlyhmsrt), who flourished from the
   sixth century to the tenth, consisted chiefly in reducing to a system
   of rules the pronunciation of the text which had been fixed by their
   predecessors. The Massora [888] embodies the readings which tradition
   substituted for the written text (ktyv ,qry), the corrections known as
   the svphrym tqvn? [889] , and observations on the text tending to
   stereotype its interpretation in minute points. To the Massorets we
   also owe the perfecting of the system of vowel-points and accents. The
   labours of the Massorets culminated in the Western text of R. Ben Asher
   (cent. x.), and that which appeared about the same time in the East
   under the auspices of R. Ben Naphtali. The former has been repeated
   with minor variations in all Western MSS.


   The attitude of Christian scholars towards the Jewish traditional text
   has varied with the progress of Biblical learning. The question of its
   relation to the text presupposed by the Septuagint was scarcely present
   to the minds of Christian writers before the time of Origen [890] .
   Origen, when the problem forced itself upon him, adopted, as we have
   seen [891] , a middle course between the alternatives of rejecting the
   LXX. and refusing to accept the testimony of his Jewish teachers.
   Jerome took a bolder line; his new Latin version was based on the
   'original Hebrew,' and on textual questions he appealed with confidence
   to the verdict of contemporary Jewish opinion: prol. gal. "quanquam
   mihi omnino conscius non sim mutasse me quidpiam me Hebraica veritate
   . . . interroga quemlibet Hebraeorum cui magis accommodare debeas
   fidem." Like Origen he indignantly, and on the whole doubtless with
   justice, repudiated the charge which was laid by some Christians
   against the Jews of having falsified their MSS. [892] But neither
   Origen nor Jerome entertained a suspicion that the Jewish official text
   had, whether by accident or design, departed from the archetype.

   Mediaeval Europe knew the Old Testament almost exclusively through
   Jerome's Latin, as the Ancient Church had known it through the LXX.
   [893] When at length the long reign of the Vulgate in Western Europe
   was broken by the forces of the Renaissance and the Reformation, the
   attention of scholars was once more drawn to that which purported to be
   the original text of the Old Testament. The printing of the Hebrew text
   commenced among the Jews with the Psalter of 1477; the editio princeps
   of the Hebrew Bible as a whole appeared in 1488, and three editions
   followed before the end of the fifteenth century [894] . Meanwhile
   Christian scholars had once more begun to learn the Hebrew language
   from Jewish teachers, and in 1506 the publication of John Reuchlin's
   Rudiments placed the elements of Hebrew learning within the reach of
   the theologians of Europe. Under the circumstances it was not strange
   that the earlier Reformers, who owed their Hebrew Bible and their
   knowledge of the language to the Rabbis, should have, like Jerome,
   regarded the traditional text as a faithful reproduction of the
   inspired original. In the next century a beginning was made in the
   criticism of the Hebrew text by the Protestant divine Louis Cappelle
   (L. Cappellus, 1658), and the Oratorian Jean Morin (J. Morinus, 1659),
   who pressed the claims of the LXX. and the Samaritan Pentateuch. A
   furious controversy ensued, in the course of which the Swiss Reformed
   Churches committed themselves to an absolute acceptance not only of the
   consonantal text, but of the vowel points. This extreme position was
   occupied not only by theologians, but by experts such as the two
   Buxtorfs of Basle ( 1629, 1664), who maintained that the Massoretic
   text in its present state had come down unchanged from the days of Ezra
   and the 'Great Synagogue.'


   The views of Louis Cappelle were set forth in Arcanum punctuationis
   revelatum, Amsterdam, 1624; Critica sacra, Paris, 1650; those of J.
   Morin in Exercitationes ecclesiasticae in utrumque Samaritanorum
   Pentateuchum (Paris, 1631), and Exercitationes de hebraici graecique
   textus sinceritate (Paris, 1633). The younger Buxtorf answered Cappelle
   in his treatises De punctorum origine (1648) and Anticritica (1653):
   see Schnedemann, Die Controverse des L. Cappellus mit den Buxtorfen
   (Leipzig, 1879), Loisy, Histoire critique, p. 167 ff. The formula
   consensus ecclesiarum Helveticarum (1675) declared (can. ii., iii.):
   "Hebraicus Veteris Testamenti codex quem ex traditione ecclesiae
   Iudaicae, cui olim oracula Dei commissa sunt, accepimus hodieque
   retinemus, turn quoad consonas tum quoad vocalia, sive puncta ipsa sive
   punctorum saltem potestatem, et tum quoad res tum quoad verba
   theopneustos . . . ad cuius normam . . . universae quae extant
   versiones . . . exigendae et, sicubi deflectunt, revocandae sunt. Eorum
   proinde sententiam probare neutiquam possumus, qui lectionem quam
   Hebraicus codex exhibet humano tantum arbitrio constitutam esse
   definiunt, quique lectionem Hebraicam quam minus commodam indicant
   configere eamque ex LXX. seniorum aliorumque versionibus Graecis . . .
   emendare religioni neutiquam ducunt [895] ."


   Reference has been made to the place occupied by the Samaritan
   Pentateuch in this controversy. A Samaritan recension of the Law was
   known to Origen, who quoted it in the Hexapla (Num. xiii. 1 ha kai auta
   ek tou ton Samareiton Ebraikou metebalomen, xxi. 13 ha en monois ton
   Samareiton heuromen: see Field, Hex. 1. p. lxxxii. f.), and Jerome
   (prol. gal., comm. in Gal. iii. 10); reference is made to it also by
   Eusebius (Chron. 1. xvi. 7 ff.), and by so late a writer as Georgius
   Syncellus (cent. viii.), who attaches a high value to its testimony
   (Chronogr. p. 83 diaphonousi ta Ebraika antigrapha pros to Samareiton
   archaiotaton kai charaktersi diallatton; ho kai alethes einai kai
   proton Ebraioi kathomologousin). In the seventeenth century, after a
   long oblivion, this recension was recovered by a traveller in the East
   and published in the Paris Polyglott of 1645. The rising school of
   textual criticism represented by Morin at once recognised its
   importance as concurring with the Septuagint in its witness against the
   originality of the Massoretic text. Few questions, however, have been
   more hotly discussed than the relation of the Samaritan to the
   Alexandrian Pentateuch. Scholars such as Selden, Hottinger, and
   Eichhorn contended that the Greek Pentateuch was based upon Samaritan
   MSS. Samaritans were undoubtedly to be found among the early
   Palestinian settlers in Egypt. Of the first Ptolemy Josephus writes:
   pollous aichmalotous labon apo tes Samareitidos kai ton en Garizein,
   katokisen hapantas eis Aigupton agagon. It is significant that Samareia
   occurs among the names of villages in the Fayûm [896] , and a letter
   ascribed to Hadrian, and certainly not earlier than his reign, mentions
   Samaritans as resident at Alexandria. On the other hand the traditional
   account of the origin of the LXX. directly contradicts this hypothesis,
   nor is it probable that the Jews of Alexandria would have had recourse
   to the Samaritans for MSS. of the Law, or that they would have accepted
   a version which had originated in this manner. Moreover the agreement
   of the Greek and Samaritan Pentateuchs is very far from being complete.
   A careful analysis of the Samaritan text led Gesenius to the
   conclusion, which is now generally accepted, that the fact of the two
   Pentateuchs often making common cause against the printed Hebrew Bibles
   indicates a common origin earlier than the fixing of the Massoretic
   text, whilst their dissensions shew that the text of the Law existed in
   more than one recension before it had been reduced to a rigid
   uniformity.

   The prevalent belief in the originality of the Massoretic text appeared
   to receive confirmation from the researches of Kennicott [897] and De
   Rossi [898] , which revealed an extraordinary agreement in all existing
   MSS. of the Hebrew Bible. But as no MS. of the Hebrew Bible has come
   down to us which is earlier than the beginning of the tenth century
   [899] , this evidence merely shews the complete success of the
   Massorets and the Sopherim who preceded them in preserving the
   traditional text, and the question remains to be answered at what
   period the tradition was created. It may be traced in the fourth
   century, when Jerome received substantially the same text from his
   Jewish teachers in Palestine; and in the third, for Origen's Hebrew
   text did not differ materially from that of Jerome or of the Massorets.
   We can go yet another step further back; the version of Aquila, of
   which considerable fragments have now been recovered, reveals very few
   points in which the consonantal text of the second century differed
   from that of our printed Bibles [900] . Other witnesses can be produced
   to shew that, even if Hebrew MSS. of a much earlier date had been
   preserved, they would have thrown but little light on textual questions
   [901] . On the whole, modern research has left no room for doubting
   that the printed Hebrew Bible represents a textus receptus which was
   already practically fixed before the middle of the second century. But
   it is equally clear that no official text held undisputed possession in
   the first century, or was recognised by the writers of the New
   Testament. Thus we are driven to the conclusion that the transition
   from a fluctuating to a relatively fixed text took effect during the
   interval between the Fall of Jerusalem and the completion of Aquila's
   version. The time was one of great activity in Palestinian Jewish
   circles. In the last days of Jerusalem a school had been founded at
   Jamnia (Jabneh, Yebna) [902] , near the Philistine seaboard, by R.
   Jochanan ben Zaccai. To this centre the representatives of Judaism
   flocked after the destruction of the city, and here, until the fresh
   troubles of the war of Bar-Cochba (A.D. 132--5), Biblical studies were
   prosecuted with new ardour under a succession of eminent Rabbis. At
   Jamnia about A.D. 90 a synod was held which discussed various questions
   connected with the settlement of the Canon. At Jamnia also
   traditionalism reached its zenith under the teaching of R. Eliezer ben
   Hyrcanus, R. Joshua ben Chananya, and their more famous pupil R. Akiba
   ben Joseph, the author of the dogma that every word, particle and
   letter in the Hebrew Bible has a meaning, and serves some purpose which
   can be expressed by hermeneutical methods. From this canon of
   interpretation to the establishment of an official text is but a single
   step; a book of which the very letters possess a divine authority
   cannot be left to the unauthorised revision of scribes or editors.
   Whether the result was reached by a selection of approved readings, or
   by the suppression of MSS. which were not in agreement with an official
   copy, or whether it was due to an individual Rabbi or the work of a
   generation, is matter of conjecture. But it seems to be clear that in
   one way or another the age which followed the fall of Jerusalem
   witnessed the creation of a standard text not materially different from
   that which the Massorets stereotyped and which all MSS. and editions
   have reproduced [903] .


   (b) It is the business of the textual critic to get behind this
   official text, and to recover so far as he can the various recensions
   which it has displaced. In this work he is aided by the Ancient
   Versions, but especially by the Septuagint. Of the Versions the
   Septuagint alone is actually earlier than the fixing of the Hebrew
   text. In point of age, indeed, it must yield to the Samaritan
   Pentateuch, the archetype of which may have been in the hands of the
   Samaritans in the days of Nehemiah (c. B.C. 432) [904] ; but the
   polemical bias of that people, and the relatively late date of the MSS.
   on which the printed text depends, detract largely from the value of
   its evidence, which is moreover limited to the Torah.

   Some of the difficulties which beset the use of the LXX. as a guide to
   the criticism of the text have been stated already when its character
   as a version was discussed [905] ; others, arising out of the present
   condition of the version, will be noticed in the last chapter of this
   book. "The use of the Ancient Versions (as Prof. Driver writes [906] )
   is not . . . always such a simple matter as might be inferred . . . .
   In the use of an Ancient Version for the purposes of textual criticism,
   there are three precautions which must always be observed: we must
   reasonably assure ourselves that we possess the Version itself in its
   original integrity: we must eliminate such variants as have the
   appearance of originating merely with the translator; the remainder,
   which will be those that are due to a difference of text in the MS. (or
   MSS.) used by the translator, we must then compare carefully, in the
   light of the considerations just stated, with the existing Hebrew text,
   in order to determine on which side the superiority lies." "In dealing
   with the LXX. (Prof. Kirkpatrick reminds us) we have to remember . . .
   that the LXX. is not a homogeneous work, but differs very considerably
   in its character in different books, if not in parts of books [907] ."
   Moreover in the case of the LXX. the task of the textual critic is
   complicated by the existence of more than one distinct recension of the
   Greek. He has before him in many contexts a choice of readings which
   represent a plurality of Hebrew archetypes [908] .


   The following list of passages in which the LXX. reflects a Hebrew text
   different from will enable the student to practise himself in the
   critical use of the Version.


   Gen. iv. 8 does not give the words of Cain, though vy'mr leads the
   reader to expect them. supplies Dielthomen eis to pedion (nlkh hsdh),
   and this is supported by Sam., Targ. Jer., Pesh., Vulg.   xxxi. 29
   'vykm, ?   'vyk (tou patros sou); so Sam., cf. v. 30.    xli. 56
   'tkl'sr bhm,   pantas tous sitobolonas 'tsrt br? [909] , cf. Sam.,
   't kl 'sr vhm vr).   xlix. 10     heos an elthe ta apokeimena auto,
   perhaps reading 'sr lv =) slv) for   sylh; but see Ball in Haupt,
   Sacred Books, ad loc., and cf. the Greek variant ho apokeitai.   Exod.
   v. 9 vysv . . . ysv     merimnatosan . . . merimnatosan vysv . . .

   xiii. 31 sr schr,     thrix xanthizousa (sr schr).   Num. xxiv. 23
   prefixes kai idon ton Og ('tvg vyr'); cf. vv. 20, 21.   Deut. iv. 37
   bzrv 'chryv, i.e. Abraham's posterity (Driver, ad loc.);     to sperma
   auton met' autous humas, i.e. vzrm 'chrykm; so Sam.   Josh. xv. 59    +
   Theko . . . poleis hendeka kai hai komai auton. The omission of these
   names in     is doubtless due to homoioteleuton.   Jud. xiv. 15 byvm
   hsvyy   , as the context seems to require, en te hemera te tetarte
   (hrvyy); but see Moore in Haupt, Sacred Books, ad loc.   xvi. 13 f.
   6 supplies a long lacuna in     (kai enkrouses . . . tes kephales
   aupou) caused by homoioteleuton; on the two Greek renderings of the
   passage see Moore in Haupt, ad loc.   xix. 18    eis ton oikon mou ego
   poreuomai (
   'tbyt yhvh 'ny hlk). The final letter of vyty has probably been taken
   by     for an abbreviation of yhvh.   o1 Sam. i. 24 bphrym slsh,     en
   moscho trietizonti, dividing and pronouncing bphr msls.    ii. 33
   supplies vchrv (en rhomphaia) which     seems to have. lost.   iii. 13
       hoti kakologountes theon huioi autou, reading 'lhym for lhm.   iv.
   1. The first clause in     is irrelevant in this place, and must either
   be connected with iii. 21 or struck out altogether. In place of it
   has the appropriate introduction, kai egenethe . . . eis polemon (vyhy
   vymym ?hhm vyqvtsv phlstym lmlchmh l ysr'l). v. 6. For gvvlyh 't'sdvd
   v't     has kai meson tes choras autes anephuesan mues. Cf. vi. 4 f.,
   and see Driver and Budde (in Haupt's Sacred Books) ad loc. H. P. Smith
   would strike out the reference to mice in both contexts. vi. 19 ?vyk
   b'nsy vytsms.     kai ouk esmenisan hoi huioi Iechoniou en tois
   andrasin Baithsamus, where the first six words represent an original of
   which     preserves only three letters. Restoration is complicated by
   the fact that asmenizein is hap. leg. in the LXX. Klostermann suggests
   vl' chrv vny yknyhv   ix. 25 f.
   s'vl lhgg vyskmv vyrbr m.   ,  more in harmony with the context, kai

   the newly recovered Hebrew has ?nlm 'a secret gift,' leg. fort. nlym 'a

     supplies kai etapeinosen autous Aiguptos, omitted by     through
   homoioteleuton.   xiv. 18 hgysh 'rvn h'lhym,     prosagage to ephoud.
   "The Ephod, not the ark, was the organ of divination" (Driver). xiv. 41
   f.     hvh tmym.   ^Luc,  supplying the lacuna, Ti hoti ouk apekrithes

   Kurie ho theos Israel, dos delous ('vrym)· kai ei tade eipois En to lao

   words hon an kataklerosetai . . . tou huiou autou, which     has lost
   through homoioteleuton. See the note in Field, Hexapla, i. p. 510.
   xx. 19 'tsl h'vn h'zl,     para to ergab ekeino = 'tsl h'dgv hlz,

   follows.   xvii. 3   ,  hon tropon epistrephei he numphe pros ton andra

   eye of the scribe has passed from 'ys to 'ysh, and the sentence thus
   mutilated has been re-arranged.   xxiv. 6 v'l'rts tchtym chdsy. No

   (c) In dealing with such differences between the Greek version and the
   traditional Hebrew text the student will not start with the assumption
   that the version has preserved the true reading. It may have been
   preserved by the official Hebrew or its archetype, and lost in the MSS.
   which were followed by the translators: or it may have been lost by
   both. Nor will he assume that the Greek, when it differs from the
   Hebrew, represents in all cases another Hebrew text; for the difference
   may be due to the failure of the translators to understand their
   Hebrew, or to interpret it aright. His first business is to decide
   whether the Greek variant involves a different Hebrew text, or is
   simply another expression for the text which lies before him in the
   printed Hebrew Bible. If the former of these alternatives is accepted,
   he has still to consider whether the text represented by the LXX. is
   preferable to that of the Hebrew Bible and probably original. There is
   a presumption in favour of readings in which     and     agree, but, as
   we have said, not an absolute certainty that they are correct, since
   they may both be affected by a deep-seated corruption which goes back
   to the age of the Ptolemies. When they differ,     will usually deserve
   to be preferred when it (a) fills up a lacuna which can be traced to
   homoioteleuton in the Hebrew, or (b) removes an apparent interpolation,
   or (c) appears to represent a bona fide variant in the original, which
   makes better sense than the existing text. Its claims in these cases
   are strengthened if it has the support of other early and probably
   independent witnesses such as the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Targum,
   or of Hebrew variants which survive in existing MSS. of the Massoretic
   text, or in the Q'ri [910] .


   For guidance as to the principles on which the LXX. may be employed in
   the criticism of the Hebrew Text the student may consult Lagarde,
   Anmerkungen zur griech. Übersetzung der Proverbien, p. 1 ff.;
   Wellhausen, Der Text der Bücher Samuelis, p. 1 ff.; Robertson Smith, O.
   T. in the Jewish Church², p. 76 ff.; Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text
   of the Books of Samuel, p. xlviii. f.; H. P. Smith, Comm. on Samuel,
   pp. xxix. ff., 395 ff.; Toy, Comm. on Proverbs, p. xxxii. f. See also
   below, c. vi.


   2. In the field of O.T. interpretation the witness of the LXX. must be
   received with even greater caution. It is evident that Greek-speaking
   Jews, whose knowledge of Hebrew was probably acquired at Alexandria
   from teachers of very moderate attainments, possess no prescriptive
   right to act as guides to the meaning of obscure Hebrew words or
   sentences. Transliterations, doublets, confused and scarcely
   intelligible renderings, reveal the fact that in difficult passages
   they were often reduced to mere conjecture. But their guesses may at
   times be right; and in much that seems to be guesswork they may have
   been led by gleams of a true tradition. Thus it is never safe to
   neglect their interpretation, even if in the harder contexts it is
   seldom to be trusted. Indirectly at least much may be learned from
   them; and their wildest exegesis belongs to the history of
   hermeneutics, and has influenced thought and language to a remarkable
   degree.


   (a) The following specimens will serve to illustrate the exegesis of

   It may be added that slh? [912] (Pss. iii. 3, 5, iv. 3, 5, vii. 6, &c.,
   &c.) is uniformly diapsalma in the LXX.; Aq. renders it aei, Symm. and
   Th. agree with the LXX. except that in Ps. ix. 17 aei is attributed to
   Th. In the Psalm of Habakkuk (Hab. iii. 3) Symm. renders eis ton aiona,
   Th. eis telos, and in v. 13 eis telos has found its way into copies of
   the LXX. (cf. '^ c.a, and Jerome: "ipsi LXX. rerum necessitate compulsi
   . . . nunc transtulerunt in finem").


   (c) Exegetical help is sometimes to be obtained from a guarded use of
   the interpretation affixed by the LXX. (1) to obscure words, especially
   hapax legomena, and (2) to certain proper names. Some examples of both
   are given below.

   B. The Septuagint is not less indispensable to the study of the New
   Testament than to that of the Old. But its importance in the former
   field is more often overlooked, since its connexion with the N.T. is
   less direct and obvious, except in the case of express quotations from
   the Alexandrian version [913] . These, as we have seen, are so numerous
   that in the Synoptic Gospels and in some of the Pauline Epistles they
   form a considerable part of the text. But the New Testament has been
   yet more widely and more deeply influenced by the version through the
   subtler forces which shew themselves in countless allusions, lying
   oftentimes below the surface of the words, and in the use of a
   vocabulary derived from it, and in many cases prepared by it for the
   higher service of the Gospel.


   1. The influence of the LXX. over the writings of the N.T. is
   continually shewn in combinations of words or in trains of thought
   which point to the presence of the version in the background of the
   writer's mind, even when he may not consciously allude to it.


   This occurs frequently (a) in the sayings of our Lord, where, if He
   spoke in Aramaic, the reference to the LXX. is due to the translator:
   e.g. Mt. v. 3 ff. makarioi hoi ptochoi . . . hoi penthountes . . . hoi
   praeis (Isa. lxi. i ff., Ps. xxxvi. 11). vi. 6 eiselthe eis to tameion
   sou (Isa. xxvi. 20). x. 21, 35 epanastesontai tekna epi goneis . . .
   elthon gar dichasai . . . thugatera kata tes metros autes? ?kai numphen
   ktl. (Mic. vii. 6). xxi. 33 anthropos ephuteusen ampelona kai phragmon
   auto perietheken ktl. (Isa. v. 2). Mc. ix. 48 blethenai eis geennan
   hopou ho skolex auton ou teleuta kai to pur ou sbennutai. (Isa. lxvi.
   24). Jo. i. 51 opsesthe ton ouranon aneogota kai tous angelous tou
   theou anabainontas kai katabainontas (Gen. xxviii. 12); (b) in the
   translated evangelical record: Mc. vii. 32 pherousin auto kophon kai
   mogilalon . . . kai eluthe ho desmos ktl. (Isa. xxxv. 5 f., xlii. 7).
   xv. 29 hoi paraporeuomenoi eblasphemoun auton kinountes tas kephalas:
   cf. Lc. xxiii. 35 histekei ho laos theoron; exemukterizon de ktl. (Ps.
   xxi. 8, Isa. li. 23, Lam. ii. 15); (c) in the original Greek writings
   of the N.T., where allusions of this kind are even more abundant; 1
   Pet. ii. 9 meis de genos eklekton, basileion hierateuma, ethnos hagion,
   laos eis peripoiesin, hopos tas aretas exangeilete ktl. (Exod. xix. 5
   f., xxiii. 22 f., Isa. xliii. 20). iii. 14 ton de phobon auton me
   phobethete mede tarachthete, kurion de ton christon hagiasate en tais
   kardiais humon (Isa. viii. 12 f.). Rom. xii. 17 pronooumenoi kala
   enopion panton anthropon; cf. 2 Cor. viii. 21 pronooumen gar kala ou
   monon enopion Kuriou alla kai enopion anthropon (Prov. iii. 4; in Rom.
   l. c. this allusion is preceded by another to Prov. iii. 7). 2 Cor.
   iii. 3 ff.: Exod. xxxi., xxxiv. (LXX.) are in view throughout this
   context. Eph. ii. 17 euengelisato eirenen humin tois makran kai eirenen
   tois engus (Isa. lvii. 19, cf. lii. 7, lxi. 1). Phil. i. 19 ?oida gar
   hoti touto moi apobesetai eis soterian (Job xiii. 16). Heb. vi. 8 ge
   . . . ekpherousa . . . akanthas kai tribolous . . . kataras engus
   ((Gen. iii. 17).


   These are but a few illustrations of a mental habit everywhere to be
   observed in the writers of the N.T., which shews them to have been not
   only familiar with the LXX., but saturated with its language. They used
   it as Englishmen use the Authorised Version of the Bible, working it
   into the texture of their thoughts and utterances. It is impossible to
   do justice to their writings unless this fact is recognised, i.e.,
   unless the reader is on the watch for unsuspected references to the
   Greek O.T., and able to appreciate its influence upon his author's
   mind.


   2. To what extent the vocabulary of the N.T. has been influenced by the
   LXX. is matter of keen controversy. In a weighty essay On the Value and
   Use of the Septuagint Dr Hatch has maintained that "the great majority
   of N.T. words are words which, though for the most part common to
   Biblical and to contemporary secular Greek, express in their Biblical
   use the conceptions of a Semitic race, and which must consequently be
   examined by the light of the cognate documents which form the LXX.
   [914] " This statement, which has been hotly contested, may
   conveniently form the basis of our discussion of the subject.


   (a) "The great majority of N.T. words are . . . common to Biblical and
   contemporary secular Greek." This is certainly true. Thus Dr H. A. A.
   Kennedy [915] enumerates about 150 words out of over 4800 in the N. T.
   which are "strictly peculiar to the LXX. and N.T." The list is as
   follows:


   agathopoiein, agathosune, agalliasthai, agalliasis, hagiazein,
   hagiasmos, hagiosune, ainesis, akrogoniaios, aichmaloteuein, alisgema,
   hallelouia, allogenes, amethustos, amen, amphiazein, anazonnuein,
   anathematizein, anexichniastos, anthropareskos, antapodoma,
   apodekatoin, apokalupsis, apokephalizein, apophthengesthai, batos,
   bdelugma, bebeloun, broche, geenna, gnostes, gonguzein, gumnotes,
   dekatoun, dektos, diagonguzein, dolioun, dotes, dunamoun,
   hebdomekontakis, eirenopoiein, ekzetein, ekmukterizein, ekpeirazein,
   ekporneuein, ekrizoun, elegmos, elenxis, empaigmos, empaiktes, enanti,
   endiduskein, endoxazein, endunamoun, eneulogein, enkainizein, entalma,
   entaphiazein, enopion, enotizesthai, exapina, exastraptein,
   exolethreuein, exoudenoun, exupnizein, epaurion, episkope, epanapauein,
   epigambreuein, epiphauskein, eremosis, eudokia, ephemeria, hettema,
   thelesis, hierateuein, hierateuma, katharizein, katharismos,
   katakauchasthai, katakleronomein, katanuxis, katanussein, katenopion,
   katoiketerion, kauson, kauchesis, kludonizesthai, koros, krataioun,
   laxeutos, leitourgikos, lutrosis, makrothumein, manna, mataiotes,
   mataioun, megaleiotes, megalosune, metoikein, misthios, mogilalos,
   moichalis, nikos, olethreuein, oligopsuchos, holokleria, optanein,
   optasia, orthotomein, orthrizein, horkomosia, ouai, pagideuein,
   parazeloun, parapikrasmos, paroikia, parorgismos, patriarches,
   peirasmos, perikatharma, periousios, perisseia, plerophorein,
   proskomma, prosochthizein, proinos, rhantizein, rhantismos, sabaoth,
   sabbaton, sagene, satanas, saton, setobrotos, sikera, skandalon,
   sklerokardia, sklerotrachelos, stekein, stugnazein, sunegeirein,
   tapeinophron, hupakoe, hupantesis, hupolenion, huperopsoun, husterema,
   phoster, cheroubeim, psithurismos, otion.


   Since the publication of Dr Kennedy's book some of these words (e.g.
   gonguzein, leitourgikos [916] ) have been detected in early papyri, and
   as fresh documents are discovered and examined, the number of
   'Biblical' Greek words will doubtless be still further diminished.
   Indeed the existence of such a class of words may be almost entirely
   due to accidental causes, such as the loss of contemporary Hellenistic
   literature.


   (b) On the other hand it must not be forgotten that the Greek
   vocabulary of Palestinian Greek-speaking Jews in the first century A.D.
   was probably derived in great part from their use of the Greek Old
   Testament. Even in the case of writers such as St Luke, St Paul, and
   the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the LXX. has no doubt largely
   regulated the choice of words. A very considerable number of the words
   of the N.T. seem to have been suggested by that version, or in any case
   may be elucidated from it.


   E.g.: agathosune, agalliasthai, hagnizein, agrupnein, hainigma,
   hairetizein, alazoneuesthai, allogenes, adialeiptos, amarantos,
   amerimnos, amphiblestron, amphodon, apelpizein, aperitmetos, haplotes,
   apokruphos, bdelugma, glossokomon, gnorizein, diadema, didrachma,
   distomos, diulizein, dorean, enankalizesthai, entaphiazein,
   enotizesthai, heortazein, exephnes, exoudenoun, eukolos, euodoun,
   theosebeia, hikanousthai, hikanos, ikmas, historein, kammuein,
   katagelos, katadunasteuein, kataklusmos, katakurieuein, katapontizein,
   kataphilein, kauchasthai, klasma, korasion, kophinos, lithostrotos,
   likman, mesonuktion, mogilalos, mukterizein, neomenia, nikos,
   nustazein, oikoumene (he), homothumadon, ostrakinos, pagideuein,
   paidarion, paradeigmatizein, parakouein, parepidemos, paroikos,
   perikephalaia, perilupos, perichoros, peripsema, pera, pleonazein,
   polulogia, polupragmonein, proselutos, proskephalaion, rhapisma, rhume,
   sagene, sikera, sindon, skolops, stenochoria, sullogizesthai,
   sumbibazein, sumphutos, tam(i)eion, tetradrachmon, trumalia,
   tumpanizein, hupogrammos, phimoun, chortazein, chrematizein,
   pseudoprophetes. To these may be added a considerable class of words
   which are based on LXX. words though they do not occur in the LXX.;
   e.g.: aprosopolemptos, baptisma (-mos), daimonizesthai, pneumatikos,
   sarkikos, pseudochrostos.


   (c) The influence of the LXX. is still more clearly seen in the N.T.
   employment of religious words and phrases which occur in the LXX. at an
   earlier stage in the history of their use. The following list will
   supply illustrations of these:


   agape, agapetos, hagiazein, hagiasmos, adelphos, adokimos, hairesis,
   aistheterion, akrogoniaios, anathema, anazopurein, anakainizein,
   anastrophe, anatole, anexichniastos, aparche, apaugasma, aphesis,
   aphorizein, baptizein, bebaiosis, blasphemein, gazophulakion, geenna,
   grammateus, gregorein, daimonion, diatheke, dogma, ethne, eirenikos,
   eirenopoiein, ekklesia, ekstasis, eleemosune, energeia,
   exomologeisthai, exousia, eperotema, episkopos, episunagein,
   epiphaneia, epichoregein, hetoimasia, euangelizesthai, euarestein,
   eudokia, eulabeia, zelotes, zogrein, zoogonein, thelema, threskeia,
   hilasmos, hilasterion, Ioudaismos, katallage, katanuxis, kerugma,

   The non-canonical books have their full share in the contribution which
   the Septuagint makes to the vocabulary of the N.T. Many Biblical words
   either occur for the first time in the O.T. 'Apocrypha,' or reach there
   a further stage in the history of their use, or appear in new
   combinations. The following examples will repay examination: aion,
   apaugasma, apokalupsis, apostole, asunetos, aphesis, baptizein,
   basileia (tou theou), daimonion, diakonia, diaponeisthai, dikaioun,
   ekbasis, eklektos, embateuein, episkopos, epistrophe, epitimia,
   epiphaneia, eusplanchnos, eucharostia, idios, hilasmos, hilasterion,
   kanon, kleros, kleroun, koinos, koinoun, kosmos, ktisis, leitourgia,
   leitourgos, musterion (tou theou), nomos, parousia, pentekoste, semeia
   kai terata, skandalizein, sumpatheia, sumpathein, soter, charis kai
   eleos, christos.


   (d) "The great majority of N.T. words and phrases express . . . the
   conceptions of a Semitic race, and . . . must consequently be examined
   by the light of . . . the LXX." But the connotation will usually be
   found to have undergone considerable changes, both in ordinary words
   and in those which are used in a religious sense. In order to trace the
   process by which the transition has been effected the N. T. student
   must begin with an investigation into the practice of the LXX. Such an
   enquiry may be of service in determining the precise meaning which is
   to be given to the word in the N.T., but it will more frequently
   illustrate the growth of religious thought or of social life which has
   led to a change of signification. Dr Hatch indeed laid down as "almost
   self-evident" canons the two propositions (1) that "a word which is
   used uniformly, or with few and intelligible exceptions, as the
   translation of the same Hebrew word, must be held to have in Biblical
   Greek the same meaning as that Hebrew word"; and (2) that "words which
   are used interchangeably as translations of the same Hebrew word, or
   group of cognate words, must be held to have in Biblical Greek an
   allied or virtually identical meaning [917] ." These principles led him
   to some remarkable departures from the traditional interpretation of
   N.T. words (e.g. arete = hvd or thlh = doxa, epainos; diabolos = stn =
   'enemy'; homothumadon = ychd ,ychdv = 'together'; ptochoi = penetes =
   praeis = tapeinoi = 'fellahin'; poneros, malicious, mischievous;
   hupokrites, the equivalent of poneros, panourgos, and the like). A
   searching examination of these views will be found in Dr T. K. Abbott's
   essay On N. T. Lexicography [918] . The proton pseudos of Dr Hatch's
   canons lies in his use of the term 'Biblical Greek' as inclusive of the
   pre-Christian Greek of the Alexandrian translators, and the Palestinian
   Greek of the Apostolic age. While it is evident that the writers of the
   N.T. were largely indebted to the Alexandrian version for their Greek
   vocabulary, we cannot safely assume that they attached to the Greek
   words and phrases which they borrowed from it the precise significance
   that belonged to them in the older book. Allowance must be made for
   altered circumstances, and in particular for the influence of the
   Gospel, which threw new meaning into the speech as well as the life of
   men. One or two instances will shew the truth of this remark. Agape in
   the LXX. rarely rises above the lower sense of the sexual passion, or
   at best the affection of human friendship; the exceptions are limited
   to the Greek Book of Wisdom (Sap. iii. 9, vi. 18 [919] ). But in the
   N.T., where the word is far more frequent, it is used only of the love
   of God for men, or of men for God or Christ, or for the children of God
   as such. Ekklesia in the LXX. is the congregation of Israel; in the
   N.T., except perhaps in Mt. xviii. 17, it is the new community founded
   by Christ [920] , viewed in different aspects and with many shades of
   meaning. Euangelion in the LXX. occurs only in the plural, and perhaps
   only in the classical sense of 'a reward for good tidings' (2 Regn. iv.
   10); in the N.T. it is from the first appropriated to the Messianic
   good tidings (Mc. i. 1, 14), probably deriving this new meaning from
   the use of euangelizesthai in Isa. xl. 9, lii. 7, lx. 6, lxi. 1.

   Thus on the whole it is clear that caution must be used in employing
   the practice of the LXX. to determine the connotation of N.T. words. On
   the one hand the interpreter ought not to be led astray by visions of
   the solidarity of 'Biblical Greek,' for the Greek of the N.T., though
   in fact largely derived from the Greek of the LXX., has in not a few
   instances cast off the traditions of its source under the inspiration
   of another age. On the other hand, the student of the N.T. will make
   the LXX. his starting-point in examining the sense of all words and
   phrases which, though they may have been used in classical Greek or by
   the koine, passed into Palestinian use through the Greek Old Testament,
   and in their passage received the impress of Semitic thought and life.
   Bishop Pearson's judgement on this point is still fully justified:
   "LXX.viralis versio . . . ad Novum Instrumentum recte intelligendum et
   accurate explicandum perquam necessaria est . . . in illam enim omnes
   idiotismi veteris linguae Hebraicae erant transfusi . . . multa itaque
   Graeca sunt in Novo Foedere vocabula quae ex usu Graecae linguae
   intelligi non possunt, ex collatione autem Hebraea et ex usu LXX.
   interpretum facile intelliguntur [921] ."


   II. The Greek versions of the second century A.D. are in many respects
   of less importance to the Biblical student than the Septuagint. Not
   only are they later by two to four centuries, but they exist only in a
   fragmentary state, and the text of the fragments is often insecure. But
   there are services which they can render when rightly employed, and
   which the careful student will not forget to demand.


   1. Each of these versions has characteristics of its own, which must be
   taken into account in estimating its value.

   (a) Aquila represents the official Hebrew text in its earliest stage,
   and his extreme literalness and habit of translating etumologikos [922]
   render it easy to recover the text which lay before him. In the large
   fragments of 3 and 4 Regn. published by Mr Burkitt, Aquila's Hebrew
   text differs from that of the printed Bibles only in thirteen readings
   [923] , an average of one variant in every second verse. Still more
   important is Aquila's reflexion of the exegetical tradition of the
   school of Jamnia. Here as in his text he is often in direct opposition
   to the LXX., and serves as a useful makeweight against the influence of
   the Alexandrian interpretation. Especially is this the case in regard
   to the meaning of obscure words, which Aquila translates with a full
   knowledge of both languages and of other Semitic tongues [924] , whilst
   the LXX. too often depended upon guess-work. This merit of Aquila was
   recognised by Jerome, who makes use of his interpretations in the
   Vulgate [925] . Moreover the influence which his work has exercised
   over the text of the LXX. renders it important to the textual critic of
   the older Greek version [926] . (b) The paraphrasing manner of
   Symmachus hinders the free use of his version either for textual or
   hermeneutical purposes. But it is often interesting as revealing the
   exegetical tendencies of his school, and its fulness serves to correct
   the extreme literalness of Aquila. Jerome used it for his Vulgate even
   more freely than he used Aquila; cf. Field, Hexapla i., p. xxxiv.
   #34;quem tam presse secutus est magnus ille interpres Latinus . . . ut
   aliquando nobis successerit ex Hieronymi Latinis Symmachi Graeca . . .
   satis probabiliter extricare." (c) Theodotion, besides contributing a
   whole book to the textus receptus of the Greek Old Testament, preserves
   in his text of the other books traces of a recension of the LXX. which
   seems at one time to have had a wide circulation, since Theodotionic
   readings occur in the LXX. quotations of the N.T. and in those of other
   Christian writers before A.D. 150 [927] .


   2. All the post-Christian translators of the O.T., but especially
   Aquila, Symmachus, and the author of the Quinta [928] , appear to have
   been not only competent Hebraists, but possessed of a more or less
   extensive knowledge of Greek literature. These qualifications render
   them valuable allies to the interpreter whether of the New or of the
   Old Testament. (a) In the case of the O.T. they serve to confirm or
   correct the LXX. renderings, or to illustrate their meaning. The
   renderings of the earlier version are not infrequently retained, e. g.
   Gen. i. 2 mrchpht ?O' epephereto, A.S.Th. epipheromenon.   6 rqy, O'
   A.S.Th. stereoma.   10 mqvhhmym, ta sustemata (sustemata) ton hudaton.
   More often they are set aside in favour of other words which do not
   materially differ in signification, but seem to have been preferred as
   more exact, or as better Greek, e.g.   Gen. xlix. 19 gdvd O'
   peiraterion, A. euzonos, S. lochos.   Exod. v. 13 hngsym O' hoi
   ergodioktai, A. hoi eispraktai.   Jud. v. 16 chqrylv O' epsxetasmoi
   kardias, A. akribologiai k., S. exichniasmoi k.   Ps. lxxxviii. 8
   'l nrts bsvd qdsym O' ho theos doxazomenos en boule hagion, A. Ischuros
   kaischureuomenos en aporrheto ha., S. thee aettete en homilia a. At
   other times their rendering lies far apart from that of the LXX.,
   manifesting complete dissent from the Alexandrian version, e.g. Gen.
   xlvii. 31 hmth O' tes rhabdou, A.S. tes klines.   Num. xxiii. 21 (trvt
   (mlk O' ta endoxa, A. alalagmos, S. semasia, Th. salpismos.   1 Regn.
   xiii. 20 mchrstv, O' to theristron (A.Th. arotron, S. hunin) autou.
   Ps. ii. 12, nsqvvr O' draxasthe paideias, A. kataphilesate eklektos, S.
   proskunesate katharos. To these instances may be added others where the
   later translators substitute a literal rendering for a paraphrase or a
   gloss; e.g. in Deut. x. 16 A. has akrobustian kardias for the
   euphemistic sklerokardian of the LXX.; in Ps. xv. 9 A.S.Th. restore
   doxa for the interpretative glossa.

   (b) Dr Hatch points out [929] that "in a large number of instances the
   word which one or other of the translators substitutes for the LXX.
   word is itself used in other passages of the LXX. as the translation of
   the same Hebrew word"; and he draws the conclusion that "the words
   which are so interchanged are practically synonymous." But his
   inference must be received with reserve, for the interchange may not be
   so free as appears at first sight; so careful a translator as Aquila
   (e.g.) has probably regulated his use of words which are generally
   synonymous with a view to the requirements of the particular context.

   (c) Many of the words of the N.T. which are not to be found in the LXX.
   occur in the fragments of the later Greek versions, and receive
   important illustration from their use of them. Indeed, in not a few
   instances these versions supply the only or the best explanation of
   rarer words or connotations. The following are examples. Ademonein, A.,
   Job xviii. 20, S. Ps. lx. 3, cxv. 2, Eccl. vii. 17, Ezech. iii. 15;
   apokaradokia, cf. A. Ps. xxxvi. 7 (apokaradokei); daimonizein, A. Ps.
   xc. 6. enkakein, 'to faint,' S. Gen. xxvii. 46; embrimasthai, A. Ps.
   vii. 12, S. Isa. xvii. 13; enthumesis, 'thought,' S. Job xxi. 27,
   Ezech. xi. 21; epiblema, 'patch,' S. Jos. ix. 5; theomachos, S. Prov.
   ix. 18, xxi. 16 , Job xxvi. 5; katapheresthai, 'to drop asleep,' A. Ps.
   lxxv. 7; morphoun, A. Isa. xliv. 13 [930] . Even where the unusual word
   and meaning occur in the LXX., it will often be found that the later
   versions supply more abundant or more appropriate illustrations. Thus
   after the Septuagint these fragments, which are happily receiving
   continual additions from Hexaplaric MSS., offer the most promising
   field for the investigation of N.T. lexicography and one, moreover,
   which has been little worked.

   On the whole, perhaps, no sounder advice could be given to a student of
   the language of the N.T., than to keep continually at hand the
   Septuagint, the remains of the Hexapla as edited by Field, and the
   Oxford Concordance which forms a complete index to both. It is only
   when he has made some way with the evidence of the Greek versions of
   the Old Testament that he will be in a position to extend his
   researches to non-Biblical literature, such as the papyri, the remains
   of the Hellenistic writers, and the great monuments of the later Greek.

  CHAPTER V.

    INFLUENCE OF THE LXX. ON CHRISTIAN BIBLICAL LITERATURE.

   1. THE Church inherited from the Hellenistic Synagogue an entire
   confidence in the work of the Alexandrian translators. It was a
   treasure common to Jew and Christian, the authorised Greek Bible to
   which at first both appealed. When after the beginning of the second
   century a distrust of the LXX. sprang up among the Jews [931] ,
   Christian teachers and writers not unnaturally clung to the old version
   with a growing devotion. They pleaded its venerable age and its use by
   the Evangelists and Apostles; they accepted and often embellished the
   legend of its birth [932] , and, following in the steps of Philo,
   claimed for it an inspiration not inferior to that of the original.
   When the divergences of the Septuagint from the current Hebrew text
   became apparent, it was argued that the errors of the Greek text were
   due to accidents of transmission, or that they were not actual errors,
   but Divine adaptations of the original to the use of the future Church.

   i. 169, vi. 19; in Ps. cxxxv.; de civ. Dei viii. 44.)


   2. Under these circumstances the Septuagint Version of the Old
   Testament necessarily influenced the literature and thought of the
   Ancient Church in no ordinary degree. How largely it is quoted by Greek
   Christian writers of the first four centuries has already been shewn
   [934] . But they were not content to cite it as the best available
   version of the Old Testament; they adopted without suspicion and with
   tenacity its least defensible renderings, and pressed them into the
   service of controversy, dogma, and devotion. This remark applies also
   in effect to the Latin Christian writers before Jerome, who were
   generally dependent on a literal translation based upon the Greek Bible
   [935] . To Tertullian and Cyprian, as well as to Clement and Barnabas,
   Justin [936] and Irenaeus, the Septuagint was the Old Testament
   authorised by the Church, and no appeal lay either to any other version
   or to the original. Nor was this tradition readily abandoned by the few
   who attained to some knowledge of Hebrew. Origen, while recognising the
   divergence of the LXX. from the Hebrew, and endeavouring to reconcile
   the two by means of the Hexapla [937] , was accustomed to preach and
   comment upon the ordinary Greek text [938] . He even builds his system
   of interpretation on the LXX. rendering of Prov. xxii. 20 [939] .
   Jerome was long in reaching his resolve to adopt the Hebrew text as the
   basis of his new Latin version, and when at length he did so, his
   decision exposed him to obloquy [940] . Augustine, while sympathising
   with Jerome's purpose, thought it a doubtful policy to unsettle the
   laity by lowering the authority of the LXX. [941]


   The following examples of Christian interpretation based upon the LXX.
   will shew how largely that version influenced the hermeneutics of the
   Ancient Church. The exegesis is often obviously wrong, and sometimes it
   is even grotesque; but it illustrates the extent to which the authority
   of the LXX. became a factor in the thought and life of the Church both
   in ante-Nicene and early post-Nicene times. A careful study of these
   passages will place in the hands of the young student of patristic
   literature a key which may unlock many of his difficulties.

   From these specimens it is clear that the Ancient Church was profoundly
   influenced by the Greek Old Testament in a variety of ways. Two may be
   mentioned here. (1) The Alexandrian Greek with its daughter-version,
   the Old Latin, supplied the basis of a practical interpretation which,
   notwithstanding numerous errors of text and of treatment, ministered to
   the religious life of the Christian Society. It was from the LXX.
   version and not from the official Hebrew of the Synagogue that the
   pre-Hieronymian Church derived her devotional use of the Old Testament,
   as it is on the whole the Greek and not the Hebrew Bible which still
   supplies the Roman Breviary and the Anglican Prayer-book with the
   substance of their liturgical Psalters. The Alexandrian School based
   its exegetical work upon the LXX., and the errors and obscurities of
   the version often yielded materials peculiarly adapted to the
   requirements of the allegorists; whilst the School of Antioch was no
   less whole-hearted in its devotion to the old Alexandrian version [946]
   . This spirit of loyalty to the LXX. continued to the age of the later
   Greek expositors; it is reflected in the catenae, and it fundamentally
   affects the traditional interpretation of the Old Testament throughout
   the orthodox East. Even in the West, through the spread of the Greek
   exegesis, and the use of the Old Latin version by the earlier Latin
   fathers, it has acquired a predominant influence. Thus, for good or for
   evil, the popular interpretation of the O. T. has been moulded by the
   LXX. rather than by the Hebrew text. (2) The LXX. supplied the Ancient
   Church with controversial weapons at two great crises in her
   history--during the early struggle with the rival forces of Monotheism,
   Judaism, Marcionism, and the various schools of Gnosticism, and in the
   long conflict with Arianism. Arians as well as Catholics appealed to
   the Alexandrian version. Thus Arius did not hesitate to argue from Joel
   ii. 25, LXX. (he akris . . . he kampe he dunamis mou he megale) that
   the Son is the Power of God in no higher sense than any other agency by
   which great effects are wrought upon the face of nature [947] . Both
   parties had recourse to Prov. viii. 22, where the LXX. rendering of
   qnny by ektisen me seemed to Arius to justify the statement that the
   Logos Himself had a beginning of existence, like the created universe
   [948] . Unconvincing as such arguments are now, they had an
   overwhelming weight in the fourth century, and Hilary speaks as if the
   cause of orthodoxy might be saved by wresting this crucial passage out
   of the hands of the Arians (de Trin. xii. "hic hiemis eorum maximus
   fluctus est, haec tortuosa turbinis gravis unda est, quae excepta a
   nobis et securo navigio infracta, usque ad ipsum nos tutissimum portum
   optati litoris prosequetur"). Neither the controversies of the second
   nor those of the fourth century can be fully understood without an
   appreciation of the place which the Greek Old Testament occupied in the
   thought and language of the Ancient Church.


   3. Familiarity with the LXX. is not less essential to the student of
   the devotional life of the Early Church. The Greek Liturgies,
   especially perhaps in the oldest parts, are steeped in the language of
   the Greek Old Testament. (a) The prayers of the Psalter are worked into
   their text, often with little or no change; e.g. St Clement (B. 5)
   [949] dos autois kardian kainen kai pneuma euthes enkainison en tois
   enkatois auton (Ps. l. 12); ib. (B. 8) kai apodose autois ten
   agalliasin tou soteriou kai pneumati hegemoniko sterison autous (Ps. l.
   14); St James (B. 37) soson ho theos ton laon sou kai eulogeson ten
   kleronomian sou (Ps. xxvii. 9) [950] ; ib. (B. 55) epilabou hoplou kai
   thureou kai anastethi eis ten boetheian mou (Ps. xxxiv. 2); St Mark (B.
   117) exaposteilon to phos sou kai ten aletheian sou (Ps. xlii. 3) . . .
   kai tachu prokatalabetosan hemas hoi oiktirmoi sou, Kurie (Ps. lxxviii.
   8).   (b) Many of their magnificent addresses to God and to Christ are
   from the LXX. e.g. St Clement (B. 12) Kurie pantokrator, hupsiste, en
   hupselois, hagie en hagiois anapauomene, anarche, monarche (Isa. lvii.
   15 + 3 Macc. ii. 2); ib. (B. 24) ho megas, ho megalonumos (Jer. xxxix.
   19); St James (B. 44) ho en hupselois katoikon kai ta tapeina ephoron
   (Ps. cxii. 5 f.); St Mark (B. 137) ho kathemenos epi ton cheroubim (Ps.
   lxxix. 2); Sarapion (J. Th. St. i.) thee tes aletheias (Ps. xxx. 6);
   ton dunameon (Ps. lviii. 6); ton pneumaton (Num. xvi. 22).   (c)
   Passing allusions are made to the LXX., some times difficult to explain
   without its aid, e.g. St Clement (B. 6) ho ton anthropoktonon ophin
   desmoten paradous hemin hos strouthion paidiois (cf. Job xl. 14); ib.
   (B. 15) logon theon . . . angelon tes megales boules sou (Isa. ix. 6);
   St James (B. 55) ton to hagion sou thusiasterion kuklounton diakonon
   (Ps. xxv. 6); ib. (B. 57) en chora zonton (Ps. cxiv. 9); St Mark (B.
   126) eisodous kai exodous hemon en pase eirene katakosmeson (1 Regn.
   xxix. 6: Ps. cxx. 8); ib. (B. 133) ex hetoimou katoiketeriou sou (Exod.
   xv. 17; 3 Regn. viii. 39 ff.); St Basil (B. 335) he elpis ton
   apelpismenon (Judith ix. 11); Sarapion: ho thanaton kai zoogonon (1
   Regn. ii. 6).   (d) Much of the technical phraseology of the Liturgies
   is from the LXX.: e.g. ta hagia (Lev. xxii. 2), anaphora (Num. iv. 19),
   dora (Gen. iv. 4), thusia (Gen. iv. 3), leitourgia (Exod. xxxvii. 19),
   thusia aineseos (Lev. vii. 3 f., Ps. xlix. 14, 23), prothesis (Exod.
   xxxix. 18), prokeimena (Lev. xxiv. 7), prosphora (3 Regn. vii. 34),
   teleioun (Exod. xxix. 9).   (e) The same is true with regard to some of
   the oldest Eucharistic formulae, e.g. the Preface and Sanctus [951]
   which are based on Isa. vi. 2--3, the Kyrie eleison (Psalms, passim),
   the Gustate (Cyril H. myst. v. 20) [952] .


   4. The Greek terminology of Christian Doctrine is largely indebted to
   the Alexandrian translators. It is true that in this case most of the
   technical language of theology has passed through the New Testament and
   received there a fuller preparation for the use of the Church: and the
   influence of Greek philosophy and of Gnostic speculation must also be
   borne in mind by the student of the language of dogma. But it is
   perhaps even more important that he should trace it back to its source
   in the Greek Old Testament, which was far more familiar to Christian
   teachers of the first three centuries than the writings of Plato or of
   the schools of Basileides and Valentinus. The patristic use of such
   terms as hades, anastasis, eikon, ekklesia, ephodion, thusia,
   thusiasterion, Kurios, logos, monogenes, xulon, ousia, pantokrator,
   pantodunamos, paradeisos, pneuma hagion, pistis, prosphora, sarx,
   sophia, hupostasis, phusis, phos, charis, can best be understood by the
   student who begins by investigating their use in the Septuagint.

   Indirectly, but not less extensively, the earliest Latin theology drew
   a store of theological language from the LXX. Such words as aeternalis,
   altare, benedictio, congregatio, converti, daemonium, eleemosyna,
   exomologesis, glorificare, hostia, iustitia, misericordia, oblatio,
   propitiatio, sacerdos, sacrificium, salvare, testamentum, unicus,
   viaticum, are examples which might easily be multiplied. In the case of
   some of these terms (e. g. sacerdos = episcopus, sacrificium =
   eucharistia) the choice contributed largely to the development of
   doctrine, and it is reasonable to suppose that they entered the
   vocabulary of the Western Church through the Latin version of the
   Septuagint, and not directly from Pagan use. It is noteworthy that
   Cyprian, whose own style has been said to shew "small respect for the
   language of the Latin Bible [953] ," persistently used these O. T.
   words in reference to the Christian ministry and the Eucharistic
   offering.


   5. One great monument of ancient Christianity, which still exercises a
   direct influence over the vast Latin communion, seemed at one time
   likely to serve as a counteracting force to the Septuagint. It was the
   deliberate purpose of Jerome to set aside in the West the authority of
   a daughter-version of the LXX., and to establish in its place, by means
   of his new Latin Bible, that of the official Hebrew text. Nevertheless,
   through a variety of causes, the Vulgate, as it is now read by the
   Latin Church, perpetuates many of the characteristic features of the
   LXX. (a) The Psalter of the Vulgate, as we have seen, is taken from
   Jerome's second revision of the Old Latin, and not from his Psalterium
   Hebraicum, or translation of the Hebrew text; and the books of Wisdom,
   Sirach, Baruch, and 1, 2 Maccabees, are given in the Old Latin forms
   [954] . (b) The rest of the Old Testament retains, in the Clementine
   Vulgate, numerous traces of Septuagint readings and renderings. A few
   examples may be given: Gen. iii. 15 "tu insidiaberis (tereseis)
   calcaneo eius"; iv. 8 "dixitque Cain ad Abel fratrem eius Egrediamur
   foras" (dielthomen eis to pedion); vi. 5 "non permanebit (ou me
   katameine) "Spiritus meus in homine"; xlix. 10 "ipse erit expectatio
   (prosdokia) gentium"; Num. xxiv. 24 "vastabuntque Hebraeos"; Isa. vii.
   14 "ecce virgo concipiet"; Lam. iv. 20 "Spiritus oris nostri Christus
   dominus"; Zech. iii. 8 "adducam servum meum Orientem" (Anatolen). It
   must indeed be remembered that loans from the LXX. are not always of
   Jerome's borrowing; some of them have made their way into the text of
   the Vulgate during the course of its transmission (see Vercellone,
   Variae lectiones vulgatae Latinae bibliorum editionum, ii. p. viii
   sqq.). But they hold their place in the authorised Latin Bible of the
   West, and represent there to this day the influence of the Alexandrian
   Greek version. (c) Many of the words of the Vulgate are more or less
   complete transliterations of the Greek words used by the LXX. in the
   same contexts, survivals in great part from the O. L., where they had
   familiarised themselves to Latin ears [955] . Thus we have arceuthinus
   (2 Chr. ii. 8), azyma, azymi (Gen. xix. 3, Exod. xii. 8), blasphemare
   (Lev. xxiv. 11), cartallus (Deut. xxvi. 2), cataplasmare (Isa. xxxviii.
   21), cauma (Job xxx. 30), choerogryllus (Lev. xi. 5), christus (1 Regn.
   ii. 10), chytropus (Lev. xi. 35), cidaris (Lev. xvi. 4), creagra (2
   Chr. iv. 11), doma (Jer. xix. 13), ecclesia (1 Regn. xvii. 47),
   gazophylacium (Ezech. xl. 17), holocaustum (Lev. i. 3), laganum (Exod.
   xxix. 23), latomus (3 Regn. v. 15), luter (3 Regn. vii. 17 = 30),
   naulum (Jon. i. 3), nycticorax (Deut. xiv. 17), sabbatum (Exod. xvi.
   23), synagoga (Num. xxvii. 21), theristrum (Gen. xxxviii. 14), thymiama
   (Exod. xxx. 1), zelotes (Exod. xx. 5), zelotypta (Num. v. 15). If we
   turn to the books which are directly derived from the O. L., such forms
   are of course even more numerous; it is enough to specify acediari
   (Sir. vi. 26), acharis (Sir. xx. 19 = 21), allophyli (Ps. lv. 1),
   artaba (Bel 2), decachordus (Ps. xci. 4), diplois (Ps. cviii. 29),
   eleemosyna (Tob. xi. 14 = 22), Iudaismus (2 Macc. viii. 1), neomenia
   (Ps. lxxx. 4), palatha (Judith x. 5), pentapolis (Sap. x. 6), poderis
   (Sap. xviii. 24), rhomphaea (Sir. xxi. 4), tympanistria (Ps. lxvii.
   26), zelare (Ps. lxxii. 3). Several of these words belong to ordinary
   post-Augustan Latin, but their use in the Vulgate may fairly be
   ascribed to the influence of the LXX., usually through the O. L. The
   same may be said of many Vulgate reproductions of Hebrew names, e.g.
   Moyses, Balaam, Gomorrha, Gabaon, Ierusalem, Pharao, where the LXX.
   spelling or pronunciation has been retained, no doubt because of its
   familiarity.

   The influence of the other Greek versions over Jerome's great work, if
   less subtle and widely diffused, has been more direct, and in the
   matter of interpretation more important. Thus it was from Aquila that
   Jerome borrowed the following readings [956] : Exod. ii. 5 in papyreone
   (A. en meso tou papureonos); Deut. xxxiii. 12 quasi in thalamo
   morabitur (A. pastosei); Job xiv. 12 donec atteratur caelum (A. heos an
   katatribe ho ouranos); Amos ii. 13 ego stridebo subter vos, sicut
   stridet plaustrum (A. trizeso . . . trizei); Jer. xlix. (xxix.) 19 ad
   pulcritudinem robustam (A. pros euprepeian sterean). His debts to
   Symmachus are still more numerous, and only a few can be given here
   [957] ; Num. xxv. 8 in lupanar (S. eis to porneion); Jos. x. 42 uno
   cepit impetu (S. echmaloteusen mia horme); Jud. xv. 19 molarem dentem
   (S. ten mulen); 1 Regn. ix. 24 quia de industria servatum est tibi (S.
   hoti epitedes teteretai soi); 4 Regn. ii. 14 ubi est Dominus deus Eliae
   etiam nunc? (S. kai nun); Isa. liv. 8 in momento indignationis (S. en
   atomo orges); Ezek. viii. 10 in circuitu per totum (S. kuklo diolou).
   It may be added that not a few of the Greek words retained in the
   Vulgate are from the later versions and not from the LXX.; e.g.
   grabatus (Amos iii. 12, A.), laicus (1 Regn. xxi. 4, A. S. Th.),
   lecythus (3 Regn. xvii. 12 ff.), tristegum (Gen. vi. 16, S.).

   The subject is too large to be adequately handled in a single chapter.
   But enough has been said to indicate the nature and extent of the
   influence which the Greek versions and the Septuagint in particular
   have exercised over Christian thought and letters, both in East and
   West, and the consequent importance of these translations for the
   student of ecclesiastical history and literature. Bishop Pearson's
   judgement as to the serviceableness of the LXX. to patristic students
   will always remain true: "si Graecos patres consulueris, quis eos de
   rebus divinis disserentes intelliget, qui normam quam semper in animo
   dum scriberent habuere non ante cognitam atque perspectam habeat? . . .
   sed ad Latinos patres non minus quam Graecos recte intelligendos LXX.
   viralis versio frequens utilis est, imo necessaria [958] ." He might
   have added that in the Latin Christendom of to-day the influence of the
   Greek versions is not extinct; the echoes of their text, their
   renderings, and their interpretations are still to be heard in the
   Bible, the worship, and the theology of the Western Church.

  CHAPTER V.

    TEXTUAL CONDITION OF THE LXX., AND PROBLEMS ARISING OUT OF IT.

   1. WHEN the work of the Seventy-two had been accomplished, the Jews of
   Alexandria (so the legend goes) were bidden to invoke curses, after
   their manner, upon any who should dare to add to the version or take
   from it, or alter it in other ways (Aristeas ad fin.: ekeleusan
   diarasasthai, kathos ethos autois estin, ei tis diaskeuasei prostitheis
   e metapheron ti to sunolon ton gegrammenon e poioumenos aphairesin).
   The imprecation, it has been acutely observed, may point to an early
   deterioration of the text of the Greek Pentateuch, which the
   Pseudo-Aristeas desired to check. This inference is insecure, for the
   story is sufficiently explained by a reference to such passages as
   Deut. iv. 2, xii. 32 [959] ; but it is certain that textual corruption
   began before the Christian era. There are traces of it in the writings
   of Philo, which cannot be due to blunders in Philo's own text.


   E.g. in quis rer. div. her. 56 Philo quotes Gen. xv. 15 in the form now
   universal in MSS. of the LXX. (met' eirenes trapheis en gerei kalo),
   adding the comment: oukoun . . . to teleion genos . . . eirene kai
   eleutheria bebaiotate entrephomenon ktl. This is perhaps the most
   convincing example, but we may add Gen. xvi. 14 Barad = en kakois (de
   fug. 38), i.e. Barak (Luc.); xxi. 6 ou charieitai moi (de mut. nom. 24,
   where however, as in legg. all. ii. 21, iii. 78, quod det. pot. insid.
   sol. 33, Cohn and Wendland read sunch. moi with cod. A^ phil); Exod.
   xvii. 6 hesteka pro tou se epi tes petras enchorein (de somn. ii. 32,
   cf. B pro tou se [960] . . . en Choreb, AF pro tou elthein . . . en
   Ch.). Similar corruptions probably exist in some of the N.T. citations,
   e.g. soma [961] in Heb. x. 5 (Ps. xxxix. = xl. 7), and enochle [962]
   for en chole in Heb. xii. 15 (Deut. xxix. 18 (17)). It may be added
   that double renderings already appear in Philo. E.g. in citing Deut.
   xix. 14 his MSS. give hoi pateres sou (B) in de post. Caini 25, but hoi
   proteroi sou (A) in de justitia 3.


   Justin, as we have seen [963] , charges his Jewish contemporaries with
   the deliberate excision of numerous passages in the LXX. which were
   favourable to their Christian antagonists (dial. 71 pollas graphas
   teleon perieilon apo ton exegeseon ton gegenemenon hupo ton para
   Ptolemaio gegenemenon presbuteron) [964] . But of the four passages
   produced in proof of his assertion three are mere glosses, probably of
   Christian origin; while the fourth, a genuine part of the book of
   Jeremiah (xi. 19), is now found in all MSS. of the LXX. The charge,
   though made in good faith, seems to have rested on no better foundation
   than a natural distrust of the Jews, who in Justin's time were active
   and bitter opponents of the Church. It is equally improbable that the
   Greek O.T. was wilfully interpolated by Christians, or that, if they
   attempted this, the existing text has been affected by it to any
   appreciable extent. A few traces may be found of the accidental
   influence of N. T. citations, e.g. the interpolation in Ps. xiii. 3,
   and perhaps also the reading soma in Ps. xxxix.; but apart from these,
   the Septuagint, during the first two centuries after Christ, suffered
   little from Christian hands beyond errors of transcription. What Dr
   Hort has written in reference to the N.T. is doubtless true also of the
   LXX.: "accusations of wilful tampering with the text are . . . not
   unfrequent in Christian antiquity . . . but with a single exception,
   wherever they can be verified they prove to be groundless, being in
   fact hasty and unjust inferences from mere diversities of inherited
   text [965] ."

   Accidental corruptions [966] , however, and variations of reading and
   rendering grew apace, and in the third century Origen complains of the
   uncertainty of the Biblical text in both its parts [967] (comm. in
   Matt. t. xv. 14 delonoti polle gegonen he ton antigraphon diaphora,
   eite apo rhathumias tinon grapheon eite apo tolmes tinon mochtheras tes
   diorthoseos ton graphomenon eite kai apo ton ta heautois dokounta en te
   diorthosei prostithenton e aphairounton [968] ). Besides intentional
   changes he notices elsewhere (1) double renderings: hom. in 1 Regn., i.
   4 "non me latet . . . quod in aliquibus exemplaribus habetur erat vir
   quidam anthropos tis en, codd. M, 44, &c.), sed in his exemplaribus
   quae emendatiora probavimus ita habetur, erat vir unus (A, egeneto
   anthropos heis)"; (2) transpositions: on Jer. x1vii. 4 he has the note
   he ton o' en tisi topois metatetheisa hoste ta prota hustera kai ta
   hustera prota genesthai; (3) errors of transcription: in Jer. xv. 10,
   where most of his copies read, as ours do now, ophelesa, ophelesen, he
   maintains that this reading is a graphikoe hamartema for opheilesen.
   Such faults were specially common in the case of proper names: in
   Joann. t. vi. 41 to d' homoioon [969] peri ta onomata sphalma pollachou
   tou nomou kai ton propheton estin idein, hos hekribosamen apo Ebraion
   mathontes, kai tois antigraphois auton ta hemetera sunkrinantes.

   In these criticisms Origen makes no attempt to distinguish between
   supposed errors which are properly textual, and those which belong to
   the translation itself. His sole criterion of error was divergence from
   the official Hebrew, and he assumed that all divergences were textual
   only, the translation having been originally exact. Nevertheless there
   can be little doubt that in the course of four centuries many actual
   corruptions such as he describes must have accumulated in the MSS. of
   the LXX. The koine ekdosis [970] , as the uncorrected MSS. were called,
   needed revision, and the literary activity of the third century
   endeavoured to supply it. At Caesarea in Palestine, at Antioch, in
   Egypt, independent attempts were made to restore the Septuagint to its
   primitive purity. But the remedies which were adopted unhappily
   increased the disease. "The Hexapla, from its very nature, encouraged
   the formation of mixed texts [971] "; the Hexaplaric recension,
   divorced from the rest of the work, accentuated this tendency, and the
   other recensions had a similar effect, although they aimed at the
   simpler task of correcting the errors of the koine,


   2. Of the Hexaplaric, Lucianic, and Hesychian recensions some account
   has been given already [972] . In this place we have only to consider
   how far it is possible to employ them in the criticism of the text.
   Their importance to the critic of the LXX. lies in the fact that they
   were based upon copies of the koine, as it was read in Palestine,
   Syria, and Egypt during the third century. But in order to recover from
   them this unrevised text, two preliminary tasks have to be undertaken.
   The recensions themselves must first, as far as possible, be restored
   from existing materials, and we must then proceed to eliminate from
   them such elements as are recensional, or are due to the reviser's
   hand.

   As to the first of these processes, the materials from which it is
   proposed to recover the recensions are fairly abundant and varied, but
   there is much uncertainty as to the attribution of some of them; whilst
   others present a particular recension only in certain books or portions
   of books, or with more or less of mixture. The principal authorities
   for each recension have already been mentioned, but it may be well to
   collect them here in a compact form.

   The fragments of the Hexapla have been collected by the labours of a
   succession of scholars such as P. Morinus, Drusius, Montfaucon, and
   especially Field, in whose Origenis Hexaplorum quae supersunt may be
   found all the remains of Origen's works which were available in 1875.
   These editions do not aim at restoring the text of the Hexaplaric LXX.
   in a connected form. Such a restoration, however, has been attempted in
   the case of Lucian's recension by Lagarde [978] , who desired to see a
   similar work accomplished for the recension of Hesychius, and an
   edition in which the two texts should appear facing one another on
   opposite pages. When this had been done, he proposed (1) to eliminate
   from these any Hexaplaric matter, by comparing them with the fragments
   of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion; and (2) to collect the readings
   which departed most widely from the M. T. By this process he hoped that
   a point of departure would be reached from which the reconstruction of
   the LXX. might begin [979] .

   This scheme is worthy of the great scholar who initiated it, and it was
   the first serious effort to grasp the problem of scientific
   reconstruction. But its progress has been checked and perhaps finally
   stopped by its author's premature death, and its successful
   accomplishment under any circumstances was at least problematical. So
   long as no MS. or version presents an unmixed text of either Lucian or
   Hesychius, and much uncertainty remains as to the exact sources from
   which they are to be recovered, restorations of this kind cannot be
   regarded as more than tentative or provisional. Meanwhile, such
   attempts are not free from danger. Since the publication of Lagarde's
   edition, there has been a tendency on the part of Biblical students to
   cite it as 'Lucian,' without reserve. Lagarde himself is careful not to
   claim finality for his work; he describes it as "editionem . . . in
   gravioribus omnibus satis fidam," and looks forward to a more exact
   representation of Lucian's text: "conlatis codicibus versionibusque eam
   praebentibus et patrum ea utentibus excussis efficiendum erit ut etiam
   in minutioribus adcurate edita dici merito possit [980] ." But this
   hope has not been fulfilled, and an edition of Lucian which falls short
   of exactness in smaller details cannot be directly used for the
   critical editing of the LXX. It has rendered valuable services in other
   departments of Biblical study, exhibiting sufficiently the
   characteristics of this recension, and repeatedly offering, especially
   in the four books of Kingdoms, renderings of a Hebrew text distinct
   from [981] . But in the delicate task of reconstructing the Greek text,
   recourse must be had to the actual evidence which lies behind Lagarde's
   work. For this purpose it would seem to be more important to provide
   texts based upon groups of MSS., somewhat after the manner of the
   Collection of four important MSS. (the Ferrar-group) published by Dr T.
   K. Abbott. Doubtless such groups would mainly follow the lines of the
   ancient recensions, but the identification would not be complete, and
   the student would have before him not only the general result, but the
   whole of the evidence upon which it was based.


   3. Perhaps a more lasting service was rendered to the textual criticism
   of the Septuagint by the axioms and principles which Lagarde's long
   study of the problem enabled him to lay down for the guidance of the
   student and the future editors. His early book Anmerkungen zur
   griechischen Übersetzung der Proverbien (1863) starts with the
   following axioms: (1) Since the MSS. of the LXX. are all directly or
   indirectly the result of an eclectic process, any attempt to restore
   the original text must also proceed on eclectic principles; and the
   critic must chiefly depend upon (a) his acquaintance with the style of
   the several translators and (b) his faculty of referring readings to a
   Semitic original or, when they are not of Semitic origin, recognising
   them as corruptions of the Greek archetype. (2) Where the critic has to
   make choice between two readings, he will do well to prefer (a) a free
   translation to one which is slavishly exact, and (b) a translation
   based upon another Hebrew text to one which represents the M. T. In the
   preface to his Lucianic Septuagint, published twenty years later, three
   principles are asserted: (1) A critical text of the Greek O. T. cannot
   be based on the authority of any one MS. or without regard to the
   grouping of MSS.; (2) the restoration of the text common to any one
   family must not be regarded as more than a step forward in the right
   direction; (3) even a critical text, when reached by these or other
   means, will not be free from the element of uncertainty.


   Lagarde's own words are as follows: Anmerkungen, p. 3: "nur drei axiome
   schicke ich voraus: I. die manuscripte der griechischen übersetzung des
   alten testaments sind alle entweder unmittelbar oder mittelbar das
   resultat eines eklektischen verfahrens: darum muss, wer den echten text
   wiederfinden will, ebenfalls eklektiker sein. Sein maasstab kann nur
   die kenntniss des styles der einzelnen übersetzer, sein
   haupthilfsmittel muss die fähigkeit sein, die ihm vorkommenden lesarten
   auf ihr semitisches original zurückzuführen oder aber als
   originalgriechische verderbnisse zu erkennen. II. wenn ein vers oder
   verstheil in einer freien und in einer sklavisch treuen übertragung
   vorliegt, gilt die erstere als die echte. III. wenn sich zwei lesarten
   nebeneinander finden, von denen die eine den masoretischen text
   ausdrückt, die andre nur aus einer von ihm abweichenden urschrift
   erklärt werden kann, so ist die letztere für ursprünglich zu halten."
   Libr. V. T. can. i. p. xvi.: "tenenda tria esse aio: [1] editionem
   veteris testamenti graeci curari non posse ad unius alicuius codicis
   auctoritatem, sed conlatis integris codicum familiis esse curandam: nam
   familiis non accedere auctoritatem a codicibus, sed codicibus a
   familiis: [2] unius alicuius familiae editionem nihil esse nisi
   procedendi ulterius adminiculum: [3] errare qui si quando ipsa manus
   veterum interpretum inventa sit, in ea legenda adquiesci debere
   perhibeant, quum conlatis vetera emendandi periculis omnibus indagandum
   sit quae explicationis veteris testamenti per quatuor saecula fata
   fuerint, ut tandem aliquando pateat quam incerta in hoc literarum
   genere omnia sint, et quam multa nulla alia re nisi coniectura nitantur
   sciolorum, superstitiosorum, desperantium."


   4. These principles have been stated at length, because they are
   fruitful in themselves, and they mark an important step in the progress
   of LXX. textual criticism. But it is obvious that they do not form a
   complete and coherent code of critical canons. Indeed, Lagarde's later
   axioms to some extent limit and correct the earlier, for the
   recognition of the principle of grouping the MSS. and taking their
   evidence according to families evidently serves as a check upon the
   extreme eclecticism recommended in the first axiom of 1863.
   Nevertheless the series forms an excellent starting-point for a brief
   discussion of the problems which lie before the future critical editor
   of the LXX. and the principles by which he must be guided.

   By a singular accident the first two printed editions of the Greek Old
   Testament exhibit on the whole the Lucianic and Hesychian texts
   respectively [982] , whilst the Roman edition of 1587 and the Oxford
   edition of 1707--20 are roughly representative of the two great uncial
   codices, B and A. Thus the earlier editors anticipated, though
   imperfectly and (in the case of the Complutensian and Aldine
   Septuagints) unwittingly, the two methods of editing the Greek O. T.
   which are still in use. Of the advantages and disadvantages of the
   recensional method, enough has been said. The other, which consists of
   printing the text of a single MS., with or without an apparatus
   criticus, is clearly desirable only in the case of a MS. which
   sufficiently represents an important type of text, and may thus be
   profitably used as a standard of comparison. Such are the two great
   uncials already mentioned.

   Cod. B, as was pointed out by Dr Hort [983] , "on the whole presents
   the version of the Septuagint in its relatively oldest form." Taken as
   a whole, it is neutral in its relation to the recensions of the third
   and fourth centuries; its text is neither predominantly Lucianic nor
   Hesychian [984] nor Hexaplaric. Cornill, indeed, was at one time led by
   certain appearances in the B text of Ezekiel to believe that in that
   prophet at least the scribe of B had extracted his text from the fifth
   column of the Hexapla, or rather, from the edition of Eusebius and
   Pamphilus [985] . Lagarde, however, at once pointed out the
   difficulties which beset Cornill's theory [986] , and Hort, in a letter
   to the Academy (Dec. 24, 1887), dismissed it with the remark, "What
   Cornill does seem to me to have proved is that in Ezekiel B and the
   LXX. text of the Hexapla have an element in common at variance with
   most other texts"; adding, "The facts suggest that B in the Septuagint
   was copied from a MS. or MSS. partially akin in text to the MS. or MSS.
   from which Origen took the fundamental text for the LXX. column of his
   Hexapla [987] ." Eventually Cornill withdrew his suggestion, observing
   that the forms of the proper names in B shew no sign of having been
   influenced by Origen's corrections [988] .

   If we accept Dr Hort's view, which at present holds the field, the
   Vatican MS. in the O. T. as a whole carries us back to the third
   century text known to Origen, and possibly to one much earlier. In
   other words, not only is the Vatican MS. our oldest MS. of the Greek
   Bible, but it contains, speaking quite generally, the oldest text. But
   it would be an error to suppose that this is true in regard to every
   context or even every book, and a still graver error to treat the text
   of B as necessarily representing everywhere the original Septuagint. As
   Mr Burkitt has pointed out [989] , "the O. L. and the Hexaplar text
   convict B here and there of interpolation, especially in Isaiah."
   "Certainly (he writes in another place [990] ) in the books of Kings it
   is free from some of the gross interpolations which have befallen most
   other MSS. But it cannot claim to transmit to us an unrevised text of
   the koine ekdosis. Many of its readings shew marks of irregular
   revision and the hand of an editor. As a result of this critical
   process, B sometimes tends to agree with the Massoretic text where
   other LXX. authorities represent a widely different underlying Hebrew.
   B also contains a certain number of widely spread corruptions that are
   of purely Greek origin, which are absent from earlier forms of the LXX.
   such as the Old Latin [991] ." In certain books the general character
   of B breaks down altogether, i.e. the archetype of B in those books was
   of another kind. Thus in Judges B was formerly suspected of
   representing the Hesychian recension [992] , whilst a living scholar
   has hinted that it may give the text of a translation not earlier than
   the fourth century A.D. [993] The Cambridge editors of the A text of
   Judges wisely content themselves with "the surmise that [as regards B
   and A in this book the true text of the Septuagint is probably
   contained neither in the one nor in the other exclusively, but must be
   sought for by comparing in detail, verse by verse, and word by word,
   the two recensions, in the light of all other available evidence, and
   especially of the extant remains of the Hexapla [994] '--a remark which
   is capable of a much wider application [995] .

   Cod. A, the great rival of cod. B, "exhibits a text which has been
   systematically corrected so as to agree more closely with the Hebrew
   [996] ." "In all four books of Kings and in some other parts A has been
   conformed to the Hexaplar text . . . In fact A is often little more
   than a transcript of the fourth column of the Hexapla, but without the
   critical signs by which Origen's additions were marked off from the
   rest [997] ." In other words, adaptation to the Hebrew has been
   effected not by direct use of the official Hebrew text, but through the
   medium of Origen's work. Thus, if B represents in part the text which
   lay before Origen when he began his task, A, at least in the historical
   books, answers roughly to the result at which he arrived.

   Yet A is very far from being, even in the earlier books, a mere
   reproduction of the Eusebian recension. It has been extensively
   hexaplarised, but it possesses a large element of ancient readings
   which are not Hexaplaric, and which it shares, to a great extent, with
   the Lucianic family. Moreover, as we have already seen, the citations
   of the LXX. in the N. T. and by Christian writers of the first three
   centuries, often support the readings of A with a remarkable unanimity
   [998] . These phenomena point to the presence in A of an underlying
   text of great antiquity, possibly a pre-Christian recension made in
   Syria [999] . It must be observed, however, that the text of this MS.
   is not homogeneous throughout. The Psalms are evidently copied from a
   Psalter written for ecclesiastical use, and it is interesting to notice
   how constantly A here appears in company with the later liturgical
   Psalters R and T, and with the seventh century corrector of ' known as
   '^ c.a. In the Prophets 'AQ are in frequent coalition against B, and in
   agreement with the group which is believed to be representative of the
   Hesychian recension.

   As to cod. ' it is more difficult to form a judgement. We are still
   dependent for its text on Tischendorf's facsimiles. Moreover, with the
   exception of a few fragments of Genesis and Numbers, larger portions of
   1 Chronicles and 2 Esdras, and the Books of Esther, Judith and Tobit, 1
   and 4 Maccabees, this MS. is known to us only in the poetical and
   prophetical books. Notes at the end of 2 Esdras and Esther claim for
   the MS. that in those books it was corrected by the aid of a copy of
   the Hexaplaric text written under the supervision of Pamphilus [1000] .
   But the first hand of ' often agrees with A against B, and the
   combinations 'ART in the Psalms, 'AC in the other poetical books, and
   'AQ in the Prophets, are not uncommon. In Tobit, as we have seen, '
   follows a recension which differs widely from B. On the whole, however,
   it comes nearer to B than any of the other uncials, often confirming
   its characteristic or otherwise unique readings. Cod. C is yet more
   fragmentary and its fragments are limited to the poetical books which
   follow the Psalter.

   Thus if a single uncial MS. is to be adopted as a standard of
   comparison, it is obvious that either A or B must be chosen for the
   purpose, and B is to be preferred as being freer from Hexaplaric
   interpolations and offering generally a more neutral text. The latter
   MS. has therefore been employed by recent editors, and this course is
   probably the best that can be followed. But the method of editing the
   text of a single MS. leaves much to be desired, for, as Lagarde rightly
   insists, no single MS. and no single family of MSS. can be regarded as
   a trustworthy or sufficient representative of the original LXX.


   5. There remains the alternative of constructing a critical text. This
   can only be done by the scientific use of all existing materials [1001]
   . The task which lies before the critical editor of the LXX. is partly
   similar to that of the N. T. editor, and partly sui generis. The
   general principles which will guide him are those which have been
   expounded by Dr Hort in the second part of Introduction to the N. T. in
   Greek [1002] . The documents moreover fall into the same three classes:
   (1) MSS., (2) versions, (3) literary citations; although in the case of
   the LXX., the versions are 'daughter-versions' and not based upon an
   original text, and the citations are not limited to post-apostolic
   Christian writers, but may be gathered also from Philo, Josephus, and
   the New Testament. But in the application of the principles of
   criticism to these documents the critic of the LXX. must strike out a
   path for himself. Here his course will partly be shaped by the fact
   that he is dealing with a version and not with an original text [1003]
   , and by the history of the transmission of the version; which is only
   to a limited extent identical with that of the transmission of the
   Greek New Testament.

   (a) The first business of the critic of the LXX. is to review the
   documentary evidence which is available for his use. This has been
   already described at some length (MSS., pp. 122--170; Versions, pp.
   87--121; Citations, pp. 369--432). The preliminary work of preparing
   these materials for use is still in progress. We now have access to
   photographic reproductions of codd. ABGLQTh, facsimiles or printed
   texts of 'CDEFHKO RTUYZGP, and collations of the remaining uncials, and
   of a large number of the cursives. But the facsimiles are more or less
   inadequate, and the older collations of unpublished MSS. need careful
   verification. To turn to the versions, the fragments of the Old Latin
   are now for the most part accessible in carefully edited but scattered
   texts, and the more important of the Egyptian and Syriac versions have
   received much attention; but the Armenian, Ethiopic, Arabic, Georgian
   and Slavonic are still but partially explored. Good progress is being
   made in the editing of Philo, Josephus, and the Christian fathers, both
   Greek and Latin. Thus, while much remains to be done in the way of
   perfecting the apparatus criticus of the Greek O. T., there is an
   abundance of materials ready for immediate use, and every prospect that
   in a few years the store will be largely increased.

   (b) When an editor has been found who is competent to undertake
   reconstruction, he will probably desire to limit himself to that one
   task, after the example of the editors of the New Testament in Greek
   [1004] , and his resources, if not as abundant as those of the N. T.
   editors, will be both sufficient and trustworthy. But with the
   materials thus ready to his hand, how is he to proceed? As in the case
   of the New Testament, he will begin by interrogating the history of his
   text. Here there are certain landmarks to guide him at starting. As we
   have seen, the three recensions which in the fourth century had a
   well-defined local distribution, have been connected with groups of
   extant documents--two of them quite definitely, the third with some
   probability. Other groups representing less clearly recognised families
   have emerged from recent enquiries, such as that which yields the text
   characteristic of the catenae (H. P. 14, 16, 28, 52, 57, 73, 77, Paris
   Reg. Gr. 128, and many others), the pair H. P. 54, 75, with which Th
   and 59 may also to some extent be classed, and the codices which
   correspond more or less closely with cod. A and cod. B respectively. It
   is probable that as the collation and examination of MSS., versions,
   and fathers proceed, other groups, or other members of the groups
   already mentioned, will come to light, leaving an ever diminishing
   number of documents which present a text either too mixed or too
   peculiar to be classified.

   (c) In operating upon the groups thus obtained the critical editor will
   possess two chief aids towards the discrimination of ancient elements
   from those which are later or recensional. (1) While the East in
   Jerome's time was divided between the Lucianic, Hesychian, and
   Hexaplaric texts, the great Western dioceses, Carthage, Milan, and
   Rome, read the LXX. under the guise of a Latin version, beneath which
   originally lay a Greek text anterior to the Hexapla itself.
   Consequently, the Old Latin, in its purest types, carries us behind all
   our existing MSS., and is sometimes nearer to the Septuagint, as the
   Church received that version from the Synagogue, than the oldest of our
   uncial MSS. Readings which have disappeared from every known Greek MS.
   are here and there preserved by the daughter-version, and in such cases
   the 0. L. becomes a primary authority for the Greek text [1005] . But
   besides these occasional contributions of a direct nature, this version
   is of the highest value as enabling the critical editor to detect
   pre-Origenic readings and to distinguish them from those which are
   later or recensional. In regard to the latter point the test is not an
   absolute one, because it is always possible that the reading on which
   an O.L. rendering is based was one of two or more that were both
   current in the koine before Origen's time. (2) But the 0. L. is not our
   only witness to the readings of the koine. Its evidence may often be
   checked and confirmed by that of the Syro-Hexaplar and the fragments of
   the Hexaplaric Greek, where the obeli and asterisks distinguish
   readings which existed in Origen's MSS. from those which were
   interpolated from other sources, or rewritten with their aid [1006] .

   (d) By such means the critic may often satisfy himself that he has
   reached the text of the Septuagint as it was found in Christian MSS. of
   the third, perhaps even of the second century. It is another question
   how far the koine ekdosis of the Christian Church was identical with
   the pre-Christian text or texts of Alexandria and Jerusalem. Early
   citations from the LXX. suggest a diversity of readings and possibly
   the existence of two or more recensions in the first century, and lead
   us to believe that many of the variations of our MSS. have come down
   from sources older than the Christian era.

   Here our documentary evidence fails us, and we have to fall back upon
   the 'internal evidence of readings.' The variants which remain after
   eliminating Hexaplaric matter, and recensional changes later than the
   Hexapla, resolve themselves into two classes; viz. (1) readings which
   affect merely the Greek text, such as (a) corruptions obvious or
   possible, or (b) doublets, whether brought together in a conflate text,
   or existing in different MSS.; and (2) readings which presuppose a
   difference in the original. In dealing with both classes much help may
   be obtained from Lagarde's earlier axioms [1007] . In detecting
   corruptions the student must chiefly depend on his faculty of
   recognising a Semitic original under Greek which does not directly
   suggest it; in deciding between double renderings, he will set aside
   that which bears marks of correction or of assimilation to the official
   Hebrew or to later Greek versions based upon it, choosing that which is
   freer, less exact, and perhaps less grammatical, as being probably
   nearer to the work of the original translator. Lastly, when the
   variants imply divergent Hebrew texts, he will prefer, ceteris paribus,
   that which departs from the Massoretic text. The application of these,
   rules, however, calls for knowledge and judgement of no ordinary kind
   [1008] .


   6. It cannot be doubted that the future will produce a school of
   critics competent to deal with the whole question of Septuagint
   reconstruction, and that a critical edition of the Old Testament in
   Greek will hereafter take its place on the shelves of the scholar's
   library by the side of the present New Testament in Greek or its
   successor. Meanwhile some immediate wants may be mentioned here. (1)
   Several important uncial MSS. still need to be reproduced by
   photography, particularly codd. ', F, R, V, T; and the process might
   well be extended to some of the weightier cursives. (2) Texts of which
   photographs have been published, or of which verified transcripts or
   collations exist, deserve in some cases detailed examination, with the
   view of determining their precise character in the several books or
   groups of books, and their relation to one another and to a common
   standard; such as the text of B. (3) The stores of fresh Hexaplaric
   matter which have accumulated during the interval of years since the
   publication of Field's great book [1009] , will soon be sufficient to
   form a supplementary volume, which might also contain the corrections
   supplied by photography and by the more exact collation of Hexaplaric
   MSS. (4) Is it too much to hope that the University which has the
   honour of having issued from its Press the Septuagint of Holmes and
   Parsons may see fit to reprint at least the apparatus of that
   monumental work with such emendations and abbreviations as it may be
   possible to adopt without seriously interfering with the scope and
   method of the edition? It is improbable that a collection of all the
   evidence on so vast a scale will ever be attempted again, and until
   this has been done, Holmes and Parsons cannot be superseded as a
   storehouse of facts. (5) A proposal was made by Dr Nestle at the London
   Oriental Congress of 1892 to compile a 'Variorum Septuagint,' giving
   the text of B with marginal variants sufficient to correct the errors
   of that MS. There can be little doubt that such an edition would be
   serviceable, especially if the scheme could be so far extended as to
   include a selection from all the variants, after the manner of the
   English 'Variorum Bible.' (6) Every student of the Old Testament will
   wish success to the undertaking which is now in progress at the
   Cambridge Press. Although the text of the Larger Septuagint will be
   simply that of the standard MS. employed in the manual edition, its
   apparatus will for the first time present to the critical scholar the
   essential documentary evidence, verified with scrupulous care, and
   arranged in a form at once compendious and helpful to research.

   [966] A good example of corruption in the Greek is to be found in Num.
   iii. 24, where all Greek MSS. and the O.L. (Lyons Pentateuch) read Dael
   Dael for Lael (l'l). The name of Joshua's father in the LXX. is Naue
   (0. L. Nave), probably in the first instance an error for Naun (NAUE
   for NAUN) = nvn). Another well-known instance is the A text of Jud. v.
   8 skepe neanidon siromaston anephthe kai siromastes, which, as Ewald
   pointed out, conceals the doublet (1) skepen ean ido kai siromasten,
   (2) skepen ean ophthe kai siromastes. In 1 Esdr. v. 34 Saphag B is an
   orthographical error (cf. A).

   [967] Though he is referring especially to MSS. of the N.T. his next
   words shew that the remark is meant to include the LXX.: ten men oun en
   tois antigraphois tes palaias diathekes diaphonian ktl.. (see, for the
   rest, above, p. 60).

   [968] The gravest instance of aphairesis was found in the book of Job;
   see above, p. 255.

   [969] In the context Origen refers to the apparent confusion of Gadara
   and Gergesa in the Gospels.

   [970] He koine ekdosis was also used of the LXX. as compared with the
   Hebrew text and the other Greek versions: see Nestle in Hastings, D.B.
   iv. 438.

  ADDITIONAL NOTES.

   P. 10ff. The 'Letter of Aristeas' can now be read in Mr H. St J.
   Thackeray's English translation (J.Q.R. XV. April 1903, and separately
   reprinted by Macmillan, 1904), which is furnished with a short
   introduction and notes, taking account of Wendland's edition and
   translation. The ostensible date of the writing is about 250 B.C.; or
   earlier, for Philadelphus is apparently spoken of as still living, and
   the references to his father (§§ 12, 22) would suggest that his reign
   was not very far advanced. Nor is anything said to imply the death of
   Eleazar, whose high priesthood is usually dated 292--277 B.C. (see
   §§ 125, 321). The writer professes, as a Greek at Philadelphus' court
   (§ 40, cf. 173), to regard the Jews, their country, and their customs,
   from an outsider's point of view (§§ 3, 6, 112, etc.). But it remains
   generally agreed, that he betrays himself to be in reality a Jew,
   writing at a later time. There is, however, some difference of opinion
   as to the actual date of writing. Schürer, placing it as early as 200
   B.C., is supported by Herriot (Philon le Juif); Wendland from 96 to 63,
   rather towards the earlier date; Willrich (in Judaica, 1900) as late as
   A.D. 33; but this view is not generally accepted. Hart (Ecclesiasticus
   in Greek, 243 ff., 263 ff.) finds evidence that the author knew and
   used the Prologue to the Greek Sirach; which, however, he dates early,
   some little time after 247 B.C. Wendland also sees some connexion, but
   accepts the more usual date of the years following 132 B.C. for
   Ecclesiasticus. Thackeray, who thinks that Hart makes too much of some
   identities of language, pronounces, on the strength of some linguistic
   details, as well as on internal grounds, for a date not earlier than
   the middle of the second century B.C., and perhaps between 140 or 130
   B.C. for the earlier, and 80 B.C. for the later limit. Probably 100--80
   B.C. fairly represents the resultant of his view and Wendland's.

   On the other hand, Mr L . Abrahams (J.Q.R. XIV. p. 321 ff., Jan. 1902)
   defends a date practically the same as Schürer's. He points out that
   the writer, though a Jew, draws his historical information, and his
   description of Palestine, from non-Jewish sources, and his
   'Table-discourses,' §§ 187--292, from Greek learning and not from
   Jewish gnomic wisdom. (On this latter point, however, opinions will
   still differ, as in the case, e.g., of Ecclesiastes.) He adds further,
   that, though there may be error, if not fraud, in the part assigned to
   Demetrius Phalereus, yet the 'Letter' has been exposed, through the
   additions made to the story by Christian writers, to some unfair
   suspicion; and that the story, as Josephus read it, appears to have
   presented nothing incredible to his mind. This is, perhaps, as far as
   anyone can now go in rehabilitating the credit of the 'Letter,' in
   which, however, a considerable substratum of fact is usually allowed to
   exist. The view of Wendland and Thackeray probably now commands the
   most general assent; though some adhere to the position of Schürer and
   Abrahams.

   P. 23. That Aristeas speaks only of the Law may be seen in §§ 3, 10,
   46, 171, 176; while the statement of Epiphanius is implicitly
   contradicted by § 302.

   P. 24. If the usual dates for Ecclesiasticus and its Prologue are
   accepted, a little time must be allowed after B.C. 132, the date of the
   writer's arrival in Egypt, before he could produce his work. Nor need
   the collections of the Prophets and Hagiographa, though in existence,
   have been finally completed when he wrote. See Thackeray, Grammar of O.
   T. in Greek, pp. 13, 15 ff.; also in J. Th. Stud. VIII. 262 ff.

   P. 34 f. Besides these portions of Aquila, the Amherst Papyrus, I. iii.
   c., contains Gen. i. 1--5, Aquila as well as LXX. The Rainer fragments
   of Ps. lxviii. 13, 14, 30--33, lxxx. 11--15 (C. Wessely in Mélanges
   Chatelain, 1910) have been shown by P. Capelle (Revue Benedictine,
   1911, p. 64 ff.) to be certainly not Aquila, and most probably
   Symmachus. Dr Nestle (Exp. Times, May 1911) also pronounced for
   Symmachus.

   P. 39, note 4. On the possible connexion of abbreviations in MSS. with
   these methods of writing the Divine Name, see L. Traube, Nomina Sacra
   (Munich, 1907): Bd 2 of Quellen und Untersuchungen zur lateinischen
   Philologie des Mittelalters.

   P. 47 f. The appearance of Theodotion's renderings before his reputed
   time (as in the N.T. quotations) is not yet satisfactorily explained;
   see Thackeray, Gramm. O. T. in Greek, p. 15: 'Critics have . . . been
   forced to the conclusion that there must have been, in addition to the
   loose Alexandrian paraphrase, a third version, resembling that of A,
   but made before his time and in use in Palestine in the first century
   B.C.' Nestle, in ZNTW, Nov. 1907, remarks on Schürer's Dilemma, p. 48,
   note 3: '"entweder . . . vor Theodotion gegeben" muss dahin ergänzt
   werden "oder ist das Dilemma falsch gestellt, and hat Theodotion das
   N.T. benützt, nicht umgekehrt"'

   P. 55, cf. p. 63. Prof Burkitt, on 'The so-called Quinta of 4 Kings'
   (Proc. Soc. Bibl. Archaeology, June 1902), says: 'I venture therefore
   to make the conjecture that the Quinta in 4 Kings is . . . a collection
   of variants set in the margin of the Hexapla, and that this collection
   contained, among other things, some notable readings of the genuine
   LXX.' And above: '. . . the fragments of the Hexapla in the Ambrosian
   Library at Milan preserve just such a collection of detached readings
   in a fifth column.'

   P. 66. On Eusebius, and the Quinta and Sexta, see Mercati, Studi e
   Testi 5, v. p. 51 ff.; on the Hexapla see also Kenyon, Our Bible and
   the Ancient MSS., p. 54 ff., and appendix, p. x, in third edition.

   P. 69 ff. For twenty years after Field's great work on the Hexapla
   appeared, the question of the existence of critical marks in the
   Hexapla itself remained as he left it. With this is bound up the
   further question of Origen's actual method; whether the LXX. text in
   the Hexapla was a revised one, or unrevised. Field pronounced for the
   former alternative, and for the presence of the critical marks in the
   Hexapla. His words are (vol. I. p. lii):


   'Non desunt quidem qui existiment Origenem priorem viam iniisse:
   videlicet, ut distinctiones praedictas non in editionem hexaplarem
   introduceret, sed in aliam seorsim adornatam, qualem hodieque exhibent
   codex Graecus Sarravianus, et versio P. Telensis Syrohexaplaris. Sed,
   ut Hieronymi declarationem taceamus, in scholiis Graecis innumera
   exstant loca, quae contrarium aperte probant; nempe ed. ton O';
   hexaplarem non diversam fuisse ab ea quam in exemplaribus modo
   memoratis hodie manu terimus.'


   (Jerome's words are to be found on page 69, note 3, of this book.)

   Of late, however, fresh doubts have arisen, perhaps stimulated by the
   discovery of the Cairo and Milan fragments of copies of the Hexapla
   itself. The work was so huge (see p. 74) that it had scarcely been
   suspected that copies had been made; but it is not proved that the
   fragments represent more than portions, or single books.

   Mercati, the discoverer of the Milan palimpsest, gives the first hint
   of doubt (1896, Atti d. Accad. d. Scienze, Torino, XXXI. p. 656):

   'Aggiungasi the Origene l'aveva arrichitta di prolegomeni a di scolii,
   per non dire degli obeli a degli asterischi, coi quali s' ingegnò di
   rendere anche più visibili le singole parole a particelli crescenti o
   mancanti nei LXX., rispetto all' Ebraico, se pure questa operazione non
   fu ristretta alle Tetraple od al testo dei LXX., estratto dall' una
   delle due collezioni mentovate, secondo che altri ha voluto,' with a
   note 'E veramente distribuito il testo, come lo è nel palimpsesto
   Ambrosiano delle Esaple non rimane più tanto necessaria questa aggiunta
   d' obeli a di asterischi per quanto riguarda l'Esaple, cfr. i prol. dal
   Field.'

   Lietzmann, in his review of the first edition of this work (G.G.A. May
   1902), raises some similar points; the following is an English
   rendering of some of his remarks:


   'Had the Urhexapla, in its LXX. column, the koine without corrections
   or additions, or a text already revised, [and] provided with obeli and
   asterisks; that is, with the additions from Theodotion? One inclines to
   take the former view as correct, reflecting that the Hexapla was meant
   to be the foundation for [future] critical work. Swete depends on
   Field. . . . Field refers to "iunumera loca," but quotes none
   expressly; and to the difficulty in regard to the transpositions, . . .
   which he does not thresh out. . . . Eusebius and Jerome say nothing
   about critical marks in the fifth column; Jerome, indeed, says
   something which points the other way (praef. Dan., ep. 57, 11, and ep
   106). Still the other view may be right . . . but caution is still
   imperatively needed.'


   The arguments, then, appear to run much as follows:

   (1) No critical marks have been found in the fragments discovered; and
   this though Jerome has them in the 'Gallican' Psalter, and the 'codices
   hexapl.' have them. (2) Eusebius and Jerome do not mention them. (3)
   Field gives practically no examples to support his view. (4, Mercati)
   The marks were less needed in the Hexapla, where the texts could be
   seen side by side. (5, Lietzmann) The Hexapla, as a foundation for
   critical labour, should preferably have had the pure text. (6) The
   variety of numbers named, Tetrapla, Quintupla, etc., up to eight,
   indicates a variety of works and copies at any rate in Psalms. (7) The
   Milan fragment is not an exact copy; its last column is not Theod., but
   Quinta. It had, however, notes and a catena, descending from Origen
   himself.

   To these arguments it may be replied (1) that critical marks may have
   disappeared in the copies as they notoriously did in other cases, in
   course of transmission. But as Jerome certainly knew of them, he might
   well use them. (2) The passages referred to by Field may be taken as
   mentioning them. (3) In default of specific quotations, Field's long
   work at the Hexapla gives great weight to his impressions. As the
   question was not specially prominent in his day, he may have thought he
   had said enough; but he can hardly have used a phrase such as 'innumera
   loca' at random. Lietzmann says he finds only one passage in the margin
   of the MS. Vat. 754 on Ps. cxxxi. 4 . . . en de to oktaselido para
   monois tois o' ekeito obelismenon--which appears to support Field; but
   it would be scarcely safe to assert that no more are forthcoming. (4)
   Origen's motives, and his judgement, can scarcely be determined.
   Collection of information was then thought more of than a pure text as
   we should now consider it, and he may have aimed at massing all the
   facts he could in his great work. The suggestion that the Tetrapla, or
   an extracted LXX. text, should have received Origen's critical
   treatment, and not the Hexapla, whether right or not, appears
   arbitrary. (6) The varying number of columns mentioned can be simply
   explained as on pp. 66, 67: 'Hexapla' was the standing number, and the
   normal name; the others might be applied when more, or fewer, columns
   were used. The Psalms can hardly be taken, in any case, as a normal
   specimen of the O.T. (7) If the Milan fragment is not an exact copy, it
   affords less certain ground for argument.

   On the whole, the arguments against Field's view are not yet completely
   convincing, even if he based it on impressions rather than definite
   proof. It may however be well to keep the other possibility in mind,
   and to suspend judgement, at least until the Milan fragments have been
   published in full and duly considered.

   Perhaps it is worth while to add, that Professor K. Lake, in his
   Introduction to the photograph of the Sinaitic N.T., suggests that
   there may have been only one MS., that of Pamphilus, between a
   corrector of Cod. F--A = Sin and the original Hexapla; in which case
   the texts of ' and B do not bear witness to a purely pre-Hexaplar text
   in the Hexapla generally.

   P. 76. An enlarged edition of the collection of Nobilius was embodied
   in the Latin translation of the Editio Sixtina (1588), reprinted by P.
   Morinus, 1624. Montfaucon's work was abridged by Bahrdt (2 vols.,
   Leipzig, 1769). The Oxford concordance, suppl. fasc. ii., takes account
   of fresh matter available since the appearance of Field's work, which
   however is not likely, so far as it extends, to be superseded for years
   to come.

   P. 82. On 'Lucian' as the koine see A. Rahlfs, Septuaginta-Studien,
   II&gt; pp. 134, 170 f. Jerome's words (Ep. cvi. 2) are:


   'In quo illud breviter admoneo ut sciatis aliam esse editionem quam
   Origenes et Caesariensis Eusebius omnesque Graeciae tractatores koine,
   id est communem appellant, atque vulgatam, et a plerisque nunc
   Loukianos dicitur; aliam Septuaginta interpretum quae in Hexaplois
   codicibus reperitur et a nobis in Latinum sermonem fideliter versa est,
   et Jerosolymae atque in Orientis ecclesiis decantatur.'


   P. 85. Since the publication of Lagarde's work (see page 188) the
   Lucianic Text has received much attention. See A. Rahlfs,
   Sept.-Studien, II. III., Göttingen, 1907, 1911; F. C. Burkitt, Rules of
   Tyconius, pp. cviii., cxvi f.; The O.L. and the Itala, p. 9; art. Text

   larger Cambridge LXX. for materials in the Old Latin and other
   versions, see below, on p. 170. Some of these materials may be
   mentioned under the particular books of the Bible they contain.

   P. 96. L'ancienne Version Latine du Cantique I--III. 4 is treated by D.
   A. Wilmart in Revue Benedictine XXVIII. 11--36.

   P. 97. There has now appeared Die Konstanz-Weingartener Propheten
   fragmenta in phototypischen Reproduction (W. N. Du Rieu; introd. Paul
   Lehman), 1912.

   P. 100. A discovery of much interest has lately been made at Monte
   Cassino, where Dom Amelli has found a revised Latin Psalter, of a kind
   hitherto unknown, and edited it (Collectanea Biblica Latina cura et
   studio Monachorum S. Benedicti. Vol. I. Liber Psalmorum iuxta
   antiquissimam latinam Versionem . . . ex Casinensi Cod. 557 curante D.
   Ambrosio M. Amelli O.S.B. Rome, 1912).

   The MS., of the twelfth century, contains the Psalter in four versions
   (cf. the fourfold Psalters noted below, on p. 165); (i) Jerome's
   'Hebrew' Psalter, (ii) the 'Gallican,' and (iv) the 'Roman'; (iii) is
   the newly discovered revision. It appears to have been made upon an Old
   Latin or non-Vulgate foundation, with renderings apparently from the
   Hebrew, and even some transliterations. Professor Burkitt (in J. Th.
   St. XIV. 55) thinks that the various renderings, following in turn Aq.,
   Symm., and especially Theodotion, are best accounted for if the reviser
   worked from a copy of the Hexapla. In this case the transliterations,
   if not due to Theodotion, may have been taken from the column
   containing the Hebrew in Greek characters; and similarly can be
   explained a few places where the reviser follows the LXX. against the
   three later versions. Professor Burkitt, indeed, thinks it possible
   that the work might have been done by one ignorant of the actual Hebrew
   letters. Perhaps this is rather far to go; but it is pointed out that
   among the 'readings derived from the Hebrew text' no case of confusion
   between d and r is recorded: certainly an unusual circumstance. It is
   possible, however, that the reviser may not have been exactly ignorant
   of Hebrew or the Hebrew script, even though when at work he 'only used
   the Greek transliteration found in MSS. of the Hexapla.'

   P. 107. The store of available Coptic material for the O.T. has been
   much enriched of late years. The Coptic Version of certain O.T. books
   from a Papyrus, edited by Sir Herbert Thompson (Oxford, 1908), gives a
   fragment of Job xxxix, and large portions of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
   Canticles, Wisdom and Sirach. The papyrus (Pap. Or. 5984) was acquired
   by the British Museum in 1901. The leaves, preserved in 62 frames
   between glass, are of large size for papyri in codex form. Slight
   verbal differences from Lagarde's Turin MS. are found; the British
   Museum text being considered inferior to it in Wisdom, but superior in
   Sirach. It is dated sixth to seventh century (or seventh to eighth,
   according to W. E. Crum in J. Th. Stud. April 1910).

   A Coptic Palimpsest, by the same transcriber and editor (1911), is
   dated by him in the earlier half of the seventh century. [B.M. Add.
   17183, obtained from the Nitrian valley in 1847.] The upper writing is
   Syriac. This MS., a parchment, was noticed by Lagarde, Orientalia,
   1879; and small portions had previously appeared. It contains Josh.,
   Judg., Ruth, Judith, Esther; originally 228 1eaves, of which 42 are
   missing. The writing is a plain square uncial. The text in Joshua shows
   independence: in Judg. and Ruth the text is akin to B.

   Dr E. A. Budge has edited and transcribed Pap. Or. 7594 (Coptic
   Biblical Texts in the Dialect of Upper Egypt, 1912) containing
   Deuteronomy, with gaps, Jonah all but complete, as well as the Acts of
   the Apostles. There are papyrus fragments in the cover, one of which
   contains Dan. i. 17, 18, in Theod.'s version. The leaves have been
   rubbed, making the text illegible in places. The editor considers that
   Deuteronomy is a copy made for private use; the text of Jonah,
   apparently by the same hand, agrees in some small points with AQ. Dr
   Budge assigns the papyrus to the fourth century; but it is possibly a
   century later than this. Out of 133 leaves, 24 are missing. The papyrus
   was acquired by the British Museum in April 1911, and published barely
   a twelvemonth after.

   In the Catalogue of Coptic MSS. in the British Museum, by W. E. Crum,
   Nos. 1--59 and 932--955 contain portions of the O.T. in Sahidic; 59 is
   Habak. iii, 940 is a complete volume, containing 151 Psalms. Nos.
   493--496 are Middle Egyptian O.T., and 712--731 Bohairic. 712 gives 364

   P. 108. The earlier editions of this book stated that 'of the Sahidic
   fragments, those that belong to the book of Job yield a pre-Origenic
   text': but Professor Burkitt, in the article referred to in note 4, has
   come to the conclusion that the facts require this to be modified, as
   it now appears. L. Dieu, however, in Muséon, 1912, p. 147 ff. (Nouveaux
   Fragments préhexaplaires du livre de Job en copte sahidique) supports
   the previous view, in opposition to Professor Burkitt and Mr Crum (on
   No. 939 in his Catalogue).

   P. 125. CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. Professor Burkitt, in J. Th. Stud. XI. (p.
   603), suggests that there is no reason for identifying the Athanasius
   who signs the Arabic note at the beginning of the MS. with the
   Patriarch (III.) of that name, since he does not sign in Patriarchal
   style. He concludes that the MS. was not necessarily in Egypt before
   1616; that it came from Athos, and is therefore Constantinopolitan, not
   Alexandrian. The question must probably be regarded as an open one,
   until more general attention has been paid to it; but Professor
   Burkitt's suggestion is apparently regarded with favour by Professor
   Souter (see his note in the Novum Test. Graece, Oxford, 1910, p. vii.).

   P. 130. CODEX SINAITICUS. The N.T. of this MS. has now been issued in
   collotype reproduction (by H. and K. Lake, Oxford, 1911). Professor K.
   Lake's Introduction draws attention to several interesting details.
   According to him, the MS. was at Caesarea between the beginning of the
   fifth and that of the seventh century A.D. He quotes Harnack's remark
   on the resemblance of its Psalter to the Psalms in the (Coptic) text of
   the Pistis Sophia: 'Dieser Text steht dem Cod. Sin. wie ein
   Zwillingsbruder nahe.' With regard to the four hands distinguished by
   Tischendorf in the MS., Professor Lake considers that the corrector A¹
   is probably, and A² almost certainly, identical with the scribe D, and
   that Cod. Vaticanus was not written by this scribe. The corrector, C,
   of the FA portion of the MS. used, he thinks, a copy corrected by
   Pamphilus himself, which alone 'intervenes between [him] and the
   original Hexapla.' See above, on p. 69 ff.

   P. 132. CODEX ZUQNINENSIS. Two Syriac MSS., Vat. Syr. 162, at Rome, 122
   leaves, and B.M. Add. 14665 foll. 1--7, five leaves, contain, under a
   valuable chronicle, including that of 'Joshua the Stylite,' palimpsest
   fragments which are assigned to six Greek uncial MSS., distinguished by
   the editor as under:


   Z¹, cent. vi, portions of Judges xvi--xxi. The text is Lucianic, to be
   compared with K 54 59 75 82.

   Z², cent. vi, portions of 3 Reg. ii--viii. and xxi. Lucianic, akin to
   82 93 rather than 19 108. (Part in Brit. Mus.)

   Z³, cent. v, a single leaf, in Brit. Museum, containing 3 Reg. viii.
   58--ix. 1. Egyptian, not Lucianic, in text. This is referred to on p.
   141 as Z^d. Doubly palimpsest; the liturgical writing above the
   biblical text and below the Syriac, is, according to Tisserant, not, as
   was thought, Coptic but Greek.

   Z^4, cent. vi, large portions of Pss. viii--xxxvii. Lucianic? the text
   is said to be of a character between A and '^c.a.

   Z^5, sloping uncials of cent. vii--viii. Large fragments of Ezek. i,
   iii--ix, xxii--xxvi, xxviii, xxxv--xlviii. Lucianic. (Part in. Brit.
   Mus.)

   Z^6, cent. vi--vii. Fragments of later chapters of Ezek., and Dan. iii.
   2--15. Lucianic.


   The MSS. are named from Zu?nin, a village near Amid. The Biblical
   fragments have been transcribed and edited with great care by Eugène
   Tisserant in Studi e Testi 23 (Cod. Zuqninensis rescriptus Veteris
   Test., Rome, 1911).

   P. 141. Th. WASHINGTON CODEX. For full information, see the
   Introduction by Professor H. A. Sanders, to the reproduction of the MS.
   (University of Michigan Studies, Humanistic Series, Vol. 8).

   This is an uncial MS. containing Deuteronomy and Joshua, almost entire.
   It was bought, on Dec. 19, 1906, y Mr C. L. Freer, at Gizeh, from a
   dealer named Ali. (Three other MSS. were bought at the same time,
   containing the Psalms, the Gospels---Gregory's and Souter's W--and the
   Pauline Epistles.) It is intended that it shall find a home in the
   Smithsonian Institute at Washington; meantime it remains at Detroit,
   Michigan. Professor Sanders remarks that many stories have been told of
   it, which are untrue; that it had not been often shown before the
   purchase was made. When first examined in America, the desert sand was
   still in the folds. The vellum is 'moderate'; the hand an upright,
   square uncial. The size of the leaves varies, from 30 to 31?9 x 25?5 to
   26?1 centimetres: average, 30?6 x 25?8, or about 12 x 10 1/6 inches.
   There is a lacuna in Deuteronomy from v. 16 ho theos sou to vi. 18 ten
   gen ten agathen, and in Joshua from iii. 3 to lao legontes to iv.
   10--lato Kurios. Deut. i. 3-5, 17 are fragmentary. There are 102
   leaves, with 3 blank pages: two columns on the page, with 31 lines, of
   13 to 14 letters in each. The text of Deuteronomy seems to resemble
   that of the cursives 54 and 75 (see p. 493); in Joshua it is somewhat
   akin to A. There is a small Hexaplaric element. Professor Sanders
   assigns the MS. to the fifth century, probably the first half; Mr
   Brooke (in J. Th. Stud. XIII. 458 ff.) perhaps to the sixth century, at
   any rate not later. Professor Sanders suggests that this and the three
   companion MSS. 'perhaps originated in a Greek monastery, were united in
   a Coptic one, and found in the ruins of one.' Dr A. S. Hunt (The Year's
   Work in Class. Studies, 1908) says that 'in all probability they belong
   to a group of Greek and Coptic MSS., proceeding eventually from the
   White Monastery near Sohag, of which another portion has been obtained
   for Berlin by C. Schmidt. Of the Berlin section the most valuable item
   seems to be an early copy on papyrus of part of the Book of Genesis.
   . . .'

   P. 141. C. Poetical Books.

   Here may be noticed the Leipzig papyrus (Univ. Lib. Pap. 39), called l
   by Heinrici (Beiträge zur Geschichte and Erklärung des N. T., IV.
   Leipzig, 1913), and L by Rahlfs, Sept.-Studien, II. p. 5. It comes from
   Ashmunên, in Middle Egypt, and contains Ps. xxx. 5--xxxi. 1, xxxii.
   18--lv., with gaps in the earlier part. Rahlfs dates it later than A.D.
   338, but within the fourth century. It may be compared with U [B.M.
   Pap. 37], see p. 142. It must not be confused with the Munich MS., Gr.
   251, of the Psalter, called L by Lagarde, in his Novae Psalt. gr.
   editionis specimen, which is assigned to the tenth century: Rahlfs, op.
   cit. p. 14; see p. 164, note. Rahlfs mentions some other uncial
   Psalters, still awaiting complete collation: Paris, Arsenal 8407;
   Jerusalem, Patr. Lib. 96, containing Ps. xx. 10--cxlviii. 6, six leaves
   at St Petersburg; Berlin, Royal Lib. Harn. 552 (Graeco-Latin); one at
   Moscow (Rumjantzowski Museum), see Tischendorf V. T. Gr. proleg. 45;
   and one at Uspenskoe, dated A.D. 862, described by Amphilochius
   (Amfilokhy, Archimandrite) in his critical edition of the Slavonic
   Psalter. All these are of the ninth century; later are Trier 7, a Latin
   text with interlinear Greek version of Ps. i.--liv.; and incomplete
   Graeco-Latin MSS. at Würzburg, Cues, St Gall, and Essen.

   P. 144. In 1904, at Turin, there was destroyed by fire an uncial MS. of
   the Psalms; which is now represented only by a few photographs,
   fortunately taken a few weeks before, and now in the possession of
   Professor Swete and Dr Oesterley (who writes of this 'Lost Uncial
   Codex' in Exp. Times, vol. XVII. p. 353 ff., May 1906). It was a
   well-written MS. of the eighth or ninth century, with a catena, which
   included passages from Modestus and Cosmas Indicopleustes, but not
   Cyr., Epiph., Greg. Nyss., Greg. Naz. Its text bore some resemblance to
   that of Cod. R. A brief description was contained in Pasini's Codices
   Manuscripti Bibliothecae Regii Taurinensis Athenaei (Turin, 1749).

   P. 145. Y. CODEX TAURINENSIS.

   This MS. has been transcribed by Dr Oesterley, and published with
   select apparatus (J. Th. Stud. VI.--VIII., reprinted by H. Frowde,
   1908). It is not an uncial, only the headings being in uncial letters.
   The body of the MS. is written in a fairly upright cursive hand, many
   letters not joined; the writing is continuous, with capitals sometimes
   at the beginning, sometimes in the middle of lines or words. The MS.
   was damaged in a fire in 1666, but escaped with slight damage in 1904
   (see above); it is now said to consist of 93 leaves of fine vellum,
   with a polished surface. The date is given as the ninth or tenth
   century.

   P. 146. A portion of the same MS. as G is at Rome (Vat. Gr. 1658). From
   this (not palimpsest) come the readings for Zach. iv. 3--viii. 16 in
   The O.T. in Greek, vol. iii.

   P. 146 ff. Among the fragments more recently discovered, the following
   may be noticed: several have been used for the apparatus of the larger
   Cambridge LXX., see below, on p. 170:

   P. 158. The cursive 67, Mr Thackeray points out, is a near relative of
   206 (Gonv. and Caius Coll. 348; cf. M. R. James, Descriptive Catalogue,
   I. p. 392). Another MS. by the scribe of 206 is Trin. Coll. Camb. O. 3.
   14. See J. Rendel Harris, Origin of Ferrar group of MSS., p. 24. The
   Trin. Coll. MS. has no titles; 206 has none after Ps. lxxvii. See
   Holmes and Parsons on Ps. lxxviii.

   P. 162. The Barberini MSS. have apparently been renumbered since the
   time of Holmes and Parsons, who gave their 226 and 227 as Barber. 1 and
   2. The present Barber. 1 and 2 are not Psalters; this information comes
   from Dr Mercati to the Rev. J. Mearns, who suggests that when the
   collations were received at Oxford, the MSS. were without numbers, and
   were simply distinguished as 1 and 2 by the editor. He thinks the
   present Barberini catalogue may date from 1830 or somewhat earlier, but
   not from as early as 1790.

   P. 163. Mr Thackeray notes that 272 ends with Ps. lxxvi. (H.-P. give
   readings to verse 17), and 287 begins with the following Psalm.

   P. 165. To list (C) add Psalms, Rome, Vat. Gr. 754, from Rahlfs, II. p.
   23. Also:

   Leipzig, Univ. Lib. Tisch. V, complete from Ps. xvii. 35 onward: and
   five Psalters with Greek text in Roman letters: viz.,

   Paris, Bibl. Nat. N. acq. Lat. 2195.

   This and the following are akin to W and Z on p. 164, note 1. W
   contains four texts, viz., Jerome's 'Gallican,' 'Roman,' and 'Hebrew'
   Psalters, and the Greek; this MS. has them in the same order.

   Valenciennes, no. 14. Another fourfold Psalter. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Lat.
   15198. Threefold, 'Heb.' 'Rom.' Greek. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Suppl. Gr.
   188. Latin interlinear version. Camb., C.C.C. 468. Also a Latin text.

   P. 166. 62 and 147 have something in common; they form, in fact, a
   sub-group, akin to, but distinct from, the Lucianic MSS. of the
   Prophets generally. See Burkitt, Tyconius, p. cviii, and Oesterley,
   Studies in . . . Amos, pp. 9ff., 17 ff. They are also among the four
   MSS. which give a peculiar version of Habak. iii.; see on p. 247,
   below.

   P. 170. The symbols used by the editors of the larger Cambridge LXX.
   are here brought together, so far as they are yet published:

   P. 182. Field's Cambridge edition of 1665 was reissued by John Hayes in
   1684, still under Field's name. 'page for page, and I suppose line for
   line,' as Dr Brett says in his Letter (see p. 340) quoted by Dr Nestle
   in Exp. Times, vol. 17, p. 380. 'By which he put a Cheat upon the
   World,' Dr Brett continues; but from inquiries made by Dr Bethune-Baker
   (J. Th. Stud. VI. 612 ff.) it would seem that Field's remaining sheets
   may have been issued without intending 'a Cheat'

   P. 186. The text of Holmes and Parsons seems to have been based to some
   extent on that of Bos; as Nestle in Hastings' D.B. (IV. 449) says, 'The
   text in the work is a reprint of b [the Sixtine]; but as it seems,
   after a copy of Bos, corrected, but not everywhere, according to an
   original copy.' H. Lietzmann, reviewing the first edition of this
   Introduction in G.G.A. May 1902, pleads for a 'friendly word' on
   Lambert Bos's edition, with its variants from the Aldine and
   Complutensian, and collection of the Hexaplaric material then known; as
   useful even now, and 'nicht antiquiert.'

   P. 192. Professor Meinhold and Professor Lietzmann have issued Amos in
   Hebrew, a corrected text, side by side with the text of Q (Materials
   for Theological Lecturers and Students, Nos. 15, 16, Cambridge, 1906).

   P. 200. Professor A. R. S. Kennedy, in Exp. Times, XXII. 9, p. 321 ff.
   June 1911, points out that a Heb. MS. at Edinburgh, which he regards as
   important, has the order Jer. Ezek. Isa.

   P. 239. Mr Thackeray thinks that 3 Regn xxii. may have originally been
   joined to 4 Regn. Thus xx. and xxi. would have been at the end of the
   book, where transposition might have more easily taken place than in
   the middle.

   P. 242. With regard to the order of Jeremiah's prophecies in and , Mr
   Thackeray has investigated the Greek text, and finds evidence that the
   book was divided between two translators (J. Th. Stud. IV. 14, p. 253
   ff., Gramm. of O. T. in Gr., p. 11 ff.). He places the division between
   Jer. a and b at the end of chap. xxviii.; and L. Köhler (Beobachtungen
   am hebräischen and griech. Text von Jeremia, Leipzig, 1908)
   substantially agrees, but places the division about a chapter later.
   Thackeray also finds signs of division in Ezekiel, and--so far as
   concerns transcription--in Exodus and Leviticus. In the Books of
   Kingdoms he distinguishes translators of different dates. In Isaiah, on
   the contrary, he finds no clear trace of division, though Mr Gray (J.
   Th. Stud. XII. 46, p. 286) thinks otherwise. On these questions see
   also Schäfer in Theologie und Glaube, 1909, 3, Ist das Buch Ezekiel in
   der Septuaginta von einem oder mehreren Dolmetscher übersetzt? and Mr
   Thackeray's other articles in J. Th. Stud., IV. p. 398 ff., 578 ff.,
   VIII. p. 262 ff., IX. p. 88 ff.

   P. 247. Mr H. St J. Thackeray (in J. Th. Stud. XI. 44, July 1910) has
   closely examined the passage 3 Regn. viii. 53a, and has reconstructed
   the underlying Hebrew text. Professor Burkitt had already (J. Th. Stud.
   X. 39, April 1909) surveyed it with a like object m view, and decided
   that Luc. estesen was an attempt to correct LXX. egnorisen, not, as had
   generally been said, reading hkyn for hvyn, but without reference to
   the Hebrew, which must almost certainly be hvdy. Mr Thackeray, taking
   this evidence to the letters of the original Hebrew, proposes to divide
   them differently, and instead of

           sms hvdy vsmym
   to read sms hvr yv smym


   The Lucianic alteration may have been caused by the awkwardness of the
   preposition which now disappears. Reading ek gnophou, he takes ek as =
   m, preferably meaning 'without,' 'away from'; and the result is a
   fairly consistent stanza, of a character which modern critics would
   accept as older in form than that of the M.T. in vv. 12, 13, and as
   better placed here:

     'Sun, glory beclouds the heaven:

     Jahve bath promised to dwell without the thick darkness.

     Build Thou my house, A celestial Palace for Thyself.'

   Possibly, according to Mr Thackeray, this represents a development from
   an original 'popular incantation in times of eclipse,' as Josh. x. 12
   from a sun-staying incantation. Further links of connexion appear
   between these passages, as in the reference in each to the Book of
   Jashar; referred to also in the lament of David over Saul and Jonathan,
   2 Regn. i. 19 ff., where 'nature allusions' again appear. These
   references, however, are differently attested; in Joshua it is a
   Hexaplar addition to the Greek; probably also in 2 Regn., where it is
   read by AB, etc. but not, according to H.-P., by N, 64, 71, 92, 106,
   119, 242. In 3 Regn. it stands in LXX., but not in M.T. (probably
   excised, Mr Thackeray thinks).

   There remains the difficult line tou katoikein epi kainotetos. The link
   between kainotes and what might be expected to correspond from the M.T.
   in v. 13 (Cf. 2 Chron. vi. 2), namely vlmym 'for ever,' is found in
   lvmym, 'youth'; epi is l; tou katoikein is lsvt, which can better be
   rendered 'for the Sabbath'; and emending lvmym to lmvt, in the light of
   such titles to the Psalms as those of ix. and xlvi. (cf. also the end
   of xlviii. and 1 Chron. vi. 20), and taking account of renderings by
   Aquila and other versions, we get, instead of the puzzling close to the
   stanza, a liturgical or musical direction, lsvt llmvt; i.e.:

   For the Sabbath. On Alamoth ('for soprano voices').

   Mr Thackeray is inclined to connect 'Jashar' with syr 'sing' rather
   than with ysr 'upright'; in which case the LXX. biblion tes odes here
   is more right than had been supposed. He points to the opening words,
   'Then sang . . .' of Exod. xv., Numb. xxi. 17; this, however, is not
   material to his general argument.

   Another illuminating discovery, by the same writer, on a kindred
   matter, concerns the difficult 'Psalm of Habakkuk' (Hab. iii.), and
   appeared in J. Th. Stud. XII. 46, Jan. 1911. This is the chapter where
   alone, outside the Psalter, the word 'Selah,' LXX. diapsalma, occurs.
   Four MSS., namely V(= H.-P. 23), 86 (Rome, Barber. V. 45), and the
   Oxford MSS. 62 and 147, have in this single chapter a widely different
   Greek version from that contained in the other MSS. (On 62 and 147 see
   above, on p. 166.) This text has been commented on by Dr Sinker (The
   Psalm of Habakkuk, Cambridge, 1890) and by Dr E. Klostermann, who
   prints the texts of the Barberini MS. with variants in his Analecta
   (Leipzig, 1895), p. 50 ff.

   In v. 9 of the 'Psalm' occurs a clause so difficult that, it is
   commonly said, more than a hundred renderings have been proposed: svvt
   mtvt 'mr, A.V. 'According to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word,'
   R.V. 'The oaths to the tribes were a sure word,' Sinker, Gesenius and
   others, 'Sworn were the chastisements (rods) of thy word,' etc. The
   difficulty lies in the shortness of the clause, the absence of
   construction, and the variety of possible renderings of the three
   unpointed words. The first word may be 'oaths,' 'seven,' 'weeks,' etc.;
   the second, 'tribes' or 'rods' (not, properly, 'shafts' or 'arrows');
   and the third 'saith' (verb) or 'word' (noun). The ordinary text of the
   LXX. has epi [ta] skeptra legei [kurios, a gloss]: Sinker, and Nestle
   (ZATW. 1900, p. 167 f.), suggested hepta for epi ta. But the Barberini
   text, which Mr Thackeray believes to be the oldest Greek version, has
   echortasas [tas] bolidas tes pharetras autou.

   The details must be sought in his paper; here it can only be pointed
   out that he shows how echortasas (= sbt) and bolidas (= mtvt) support
   the consonants of M.T., while LXX. legei suggests 'mr. (Kurios is
   obelized in Syro-hex.) He deduces that we have here a lectionary note,
   which has been merged in the text: WEEKS (or SEVEN)--RODS--SAITH.
   'Weeks' is the key or catchword for the lesson from the Law, to be read
   when Hab. iii. was the Haphtarah or Prophetical lesson, namely, Deut.
   xvi. 9 ff.; 'Rods' similarly directs to Numb. xvii. or 'Tribes' to
   Numb. xxx. 2; and 'saith' to Gen. xii. Again, tes pharetras autou
   stands for ytrv, Job xxx. 11; but it should be Jethro, indicating Exod.
   xviii.--xx. For the Primitive Lessons from the Law, the Triennial
   Cycle, and the later, Babylonian, annual Cycle of Lessons, see the
   paper by Dr Adolf Büchler in J. Q. R., V. 424, and Jewish Encycl., vol.
   XII. The variety of lessons provided by the catchwords, and the varying
   length of the lesson from Habakkuk, are thus explained. Having dealt
   with other readings, and with the Selahs, v. 3, 13, 19, Mr Thackeray
   arrives at the conclusion that Hab. iii., or part of it, besides being
   used as a canticle, was read from very early times as a lesson at
   Pentecost, being an integral part of the book perhaps by the third
   century B.C. The Babylonian cycle had it for a lesson on the second day
   of the extended Pentecost festival (see the note in printed Hebrew
   Bibles at Hab. ii. 20). The 'Director of Music,' whose date must be
   about 250 B.C., adopted it as a canticle, adding the Selahs. In
   something like this state the text found its way to Egypt, about 200
   B.C., and the Barberini version was made from it not long after; but
   the lectionary notes were not understood by the translator, whose
   version was intended for use as lesson at Alexandria. Later, when
   Ezekiel and the minor Prophets as a whole were translated, the
   Barberini version was ignored; but as a short lesson, ending v. 3,
   continued to be read in some districts, a conflate text of these verses
   arose for synagogue interpretation. The result, among other things, is
   to show that here, at any rate, the consonantal text has come down
   almost uncorrupted.

   of the Church, p. 46 ff.

   P. 256. See Professor Burkitt in Encycl. Bibl. on the Sahidic Job, as

   P. 262 ff. The more recent volumes of the 'Westminster Commentaries'
   and the International Critical Commentary are usually worth consulting,
   but they vary considerably in the amount of attention bestowed on the
   LXX. Many of the small volumes in the Century Bible series deal here
   and there with the readings of the LXX.; e.g. Professor Bennett's
   Genesis and Professor Skinner's 1 and 2 Kings. To these should be

   P. 267. Sir H. Howorth has expressed his views further in Proc. Soc.
   Bibl. Arch. 23, 24, and J. Th. Stud. V. 19, and holds that Chronicles
   also is the work of Theodotion. Thackeray is now (Gramm. of O.T. in
   Greek, p. xx) inclined to agree with regard to 2 Esdras, but has his
   doubts about Chronicles. See, however, Torrey, Ezra Studies, p. 66 ff.,
   and Apparatus for Text. Crit. of Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah. Thackeray is
   also of opinion that the hand of the writer of 1 Esdras may 'be traced
   in the earlier chapters of the Chisian text of Daniel' (Gramm. O.T.G.
   p. 12). Sir H. Howorth's views were to some extent anticipated by
   Pohlmann in the Tübingen Quartalschrift, 1859.

   P. 268. On the style of Wisdom, see Thackeray on Rhythm in Wisdom, J.
   Th. Stud. VI. p. 232 ff.; with which may be coupled his article on The
   Poetry of the Greek Book of Proverbs, ibid. XIII. 49, p. 46 ff. He
   dates Wisdom, on grounds of spelling, between 132 and 100 B.C. (Gramm.
   O.T.G. p. 62).

   P. 270. Mr J. H. A. Hart (Ecclesiasticus in Greek, p. 259 ff.) fixes
   the date of the grandson's arrival in Egypt as 247 B.C., interpreting
   the Greek phrase as 'in the eight-and-thirtieth year, under King
   Euergetes'; i.e. in the thirty-eighth year of Philadelphus, in which he
   had been succeeded by Euergetes I. He urges that under Euergetes II. no
   Jew could have worked in Egypt. (See above, on p. 10 ff.) Dr Oesterley
   combats this view in his Introduction to the book in Camb. Bible for
   Schools; but it deserves careful examination. It is curious that the
   names, which might have been expected to fix the date of composition of
   the book, admit of alternative explanations.

   P. 271. Professor Margoliouth's theory concerning the extant Hebrew of
   Ecclesiasticus cannot be said to be gaining ground. Yet, on the other
   hand, there is a tendency to agree that the Hebrew text, as we possess
   it, is not the original of the Greek, which, assuming it to be
   translated from Hebrew, must have followed two other recensions. The A.
   V. follows mainly the text of 248 and the cursives resembling it; the
   R. V. that of the uncials, which is considerably shorter. The Hebrew
   now extant comes from four MSS. dating about the eleventh century. They
   include the greater part of the book, from iii. 6 onward, except xxvii.
   6--xxx. 11. Some verses occur in two MSS., a few even in three; there
   is some variety, and considerable corruption in some places.

   P. 273. Mozley, Psalter of the Church, p. xii, remarks on Jerome's
   method: 'So that nether his eyes saw the page of the original, nor his
   fingers held the pen.' Oxyrh. Pap. 1076, containing Tobit ii. 2, 3, 4,
   8, appears to give a third recension. Dr J. Rendel Harris points out a
   connexion between Tobit and the Book of Jubilees; he holds that
   whichever borrowed from the other did so in Hebrew or Aramaic. The '
   text seems to show traces of Aramaic influence in the forms of proper
   names.

   P. 275. Baruch a (i. 1--iii. 8) is 'beyond a doubt,' Thackeray thinks,
   'the production of the translator of Jeremiah b' (J. Th. Stud. IV. p.
   261 ff.; Gramm. of O. T. G. p. 12; cf. p. 276, note 1). Schürer thinks
   this part was composed in Hebrew, and later translated, and the second
   part added. Thus he dates iii. 9--iv. 4 about 70 A.D., while Marshall
   places it, in its original form, nearly 400 years earlier.

   P. 279, note 2. Wendland (Aristeas, p. 133) says: 'equidem censeo
   Ptolemaika esse Aristeae, qui ex Ptolemaei ephemeridibus se hausisse
   testatur.'

   P. 283. It is possible that the Odes of Solomon, of which the Syriac
   text was discovered by Dr Rendel Harris, and published in 1910 (ed. 2,
   1911), have no real title to be mentioned here, as they may be
   Christian productions of a time which would remove them from any list
   of O.T. apocryphal writings. In view, however, of their possibly close
   connexion with the Psalms of Solomon, they may receive a passing
   notice. The Syriac text contained 17 (or 18) Psalms and 42 Odes. These
   latter have been variously estimated and explained; some, at first,
   thinking them to be the work of a Jewish Christian, others to be
   Jewish, but with Christian interpolations. The question turns mainly on
   the fourth and sixth Odes. The latest published theory is that of the
   Bishop of Ossory, who holds them to be hymns sung by (Eastern)
   Christians on the occasion of their public baptism. In this case, the
   date would be about the end of the first century A.D., while the view
   that their origin was Jewish admits a date as early, perhaps, as 100
   B.C. Dr Bernard's view, which has already gained some adherents, is
   published in the Cambridge Texts and Studies, vol. VIII. no. 3; and the
   Syriac text of the Odes has also been published separately.

   P. 285. To the list in the footnote may be added the Story of A?i?ar
   (from the Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, Ethiopic, Greek, and Slavonic
   Versions, edited by F. C. Conybeare, J. Rendel Harris, and Agnes Smith
   Lewis, Cambridge, 1898), and The Book of the Secrets of Enoch (or 2
   Enoch), though extant only in a Slavonic version. It may be convenient
   also to refer here to the Pistis Sophia, a Gnostic work known from a
   Coptic MS. in the British Museum (ed. J. H. Petermann, Berlin, 1851;
   and examined by A. Harnack, in O. von Gebhardt's and A. Harnack's Texte
   und Untersuchungen, Band VII. 2, Leipzig, 1892); the canonical Psalter
   is freely quoted in it, with a text bearing marked resemblances to that
   of Cod. '; and until Dr Rendel Harris's recent discovery, the Odes of
   Solomon were chiefly known from its quotation of them.

   P. 289. During the last ten to twenty years, students have devoted
   great and increasing attention to the Greek language of those centuries
   during which the books of the Greek Bible, translated or original,
   appeared. Large quantities of papyri, literary and familiar, have been
   discovered and examined; including many Biblical fragments. The
   Oxyrhynchus, Tebtunis, Amherst, Rylands, and other collections--many of
   them edited with admirable skill by Drs Grenfell and Hunt--form a rich
   store, which will doubtless continue to grow. The study of these
   materials has brought about a certain shifting in the estimate formed
   of the language of the Greek Bible, to which Professor Deissmann and
   Professor Moulton have given a strong impulse. They urge that the
   difference between the language of the Greek Old and New Testaments,
   and other contemporary Greek, is shown by the study of the papyri to
   be, lexically and grammatically, almost non-existent; they bring
   forward parallels from the papyri to almost every construction and
   phrase formerly termed a 'Hebraism'; and account for them as
   colloquial, ordinary, or illiterate Greek of the period, rather than as
   Semiticised, or as specially Egyptian or Alexandrian. They make an
   exception as regards what they call 'translation Greek'; but the
   student whose interest lies mainly in the Septuagint may think that so
   large a portion of it comes under this head, that the exception may
   carry them further from their main position than they are in fact
   prepared to go. Against t heir view Wellhausen (in his Einleitung in
   die drei erste Evangelien, 1905) speaks strongly for Aramaism in the
   N.T. itself; and others (e.g. G. C. Richards in his review of Moulton's
   prolegomena to his Grammar of the New Test. in Greek, in J. Th. Stud.
   X. 38, p. 283 ff. Jan. 1909) feel the Semitic tone or cast of much of
   the Greek Bible, and of particular expressions in it, to be so marked,
   that even the appearance of parallel or identical expressions in the
   papyri does not entirely convince them that Semitic influence is out of
   the question as the cause that produces them where they stand, and in
   the quantity that is present. On the whole, there is a natural tendency
   for those who are mainly New Testament scholars and Greek philologists
   to favour what may be called the purely Greek theory, while the Semitic
   influence is more prominent in the minds of those whose life's study
   has been chiefly concerned with Hebrew and Aramaic. But a general
   survey of the question suggests that the difference is rather a matter
   of terms and of aspect than of real divergence as to the main mass of
   facts. The balance is very fairly held by the author of the Grammar of
   the Old Testament in Greek: see pp. 25 ff., 31 ff. He speaks of . . .
   'a general recognition that the basis of the language of the Greek
   Bible is the vernacular employed throughout the whole Greek-speaking
   world since the time of Alexander the Great. The number of "Hebraisms"
   formerly so called has been reduced by phenomena in the papyri, the
   importance of which Deissmann was the first to recognise': but follows
   this with a caution: 'the emphasis which has been laid upon the
   occurrence of certain words and usages in the Egyptian papyri which are
   exactly equivalent to, or bear a fairly close resemblance to, phrases
   in the Greek Bible hitherto regarded as "Hebraic" is likely to create a
   false impression, especially as regards the nature of the Semitic
   element in the LXX.' He points out the slightness of
   dialect-differences in the koine, and dismisses the theory of a
   '"Jewish-Greek" jargon, in use in the Ghettos of Alexandria'; but adds,
   'Notwithstanding that certain so-called "Hebraisms" have been removed
   from that category . . . it is impossible to deny the existence of a
   strong Semitic influence in the Greek of the LXX.? He agrees in the
   main with Dr J. H. Moulton as to 'the overworking of . . . certain
   correct, though unidiomatic, modes of speech, because they happen to
   coincide with Hebrew idioms.' Once more: 'The Hebraic character of
   these books [the Pentateuch and some other of the earlier versions]
   consists in the accumulation of a number of just tolerable Greek
   phrases, which nearly correspond to what is normal and idiomatic in
   Hebrew.'

   The present writer must content himself with a reference to his Isaiah
   according to the Septuagint, vol. I. p. 35 ff., 'Methods of Rendering,'
   for a slightly different view of the subject. But it may be of interest
   to quote a passage from a book published so long ago as 1875 (A. Carr,
   Notes on St Luke, Introduction, p. 9 ff.) to show how far it was
   possible even then, before the discovery and study of the papyri had
   made much progress, to estimate the nature of the Greek of the
   Alexandrian and New Testament periods. Most of the following passages
   might have been written yesterday.

   'When the books of the New Testament were written, Greek had become the
   literary language of the world. . . . The Greek dialect which the
   Evangelists and Apostles adopted or found is a far less exact
   representative of thought than the Greek that was handled by Thucydides
   or Euripides--the middle voice is rapidly disappearing, the dual number
   is never employed, the tenses of verbs are losing their distinctive
   force, and the aorist is beginning to be used . . . to the exclusion of
   the synthetic perfect. . . . The Attic dialect . . . was in a sense
   limited and peculiar. Its fastidious nature made it impatient of
   foreign intrusion. Hellenistic Greek, on the contrary, was
   all-embracing in its sympathies. . . . The purest Attic appears on the
   same page with an antiquated Aeolic form or a modern barbarism. The
   campaigns of Alexander . . . the luxury of eastern satraps, the schools
   of Alexandria, . . . the Homeric enthusiasm of the grammarians, . . .
   have contributed to store the rich though barbarous magazine of
   Hellenistic Greek.

   It will be seen that Hellenistic Greek did not grow degenerate in the
   lips of natives, but was corrupted by foreigners; and, just as the
   waters of a stream are coloured by the soil over which they flow, so
   the Greek language in the New Testament is strongly influenced by
   Aramaic forms of expression. It is, indeed, often simply Aramaic thinly
   disguised by a Greek dress. But, on the other hand, there has been,
   perhaps, too great a tendency to set down every idiom that offends the
   scholar's ear as a Hebrew mode of expression. This strangeness of idiom
   is frequently to be referred to other causes. Sometimes it is the
   influence of Latin; sometimes the idiom will be found to be Greek as
   well as Hebrew, but Greek of a kind that had been heretofore confined
   to the speech of the vulgar.'

   The publications on the kindred study of Inscriptions are widely
   scattered, largely in periodicals, and so numerous that only a small
   selection can be mentioned here:


   E. S. Roberts and E. A. Gardner, Introduction to Greek Epigraphy, vol.
   1 (out of print), vol. 2, 1905; W. Larfeld, Handbuch der Griechischen
   Epigraphik, Leipzig, vol. I., 1908, vol. 2, 1902; E. Schwyzer (formerly

   Inschriften, Upsala, 1903; O. Kern, Die Inschriften von Magnesia am
   Maeander, Berlin, 1900; F. Hiller von Gaertringen, Inschriften von
   Priene, 1906.

   The Berlin Inscriptiones Graecae now extend to twelve volumes; there
   are also four vols. of Inscr. Gr. ad res Romanas pertinentes, Paris;
   and the Recueil d'Inscriptions grecques, ed. C. Michel (Brussels, 1900,
   suppl. i. 1911).


   (The study of the Inscriptions is important, because they range over
   the whole of the Greek-speaking territory, while papyri are chiefly
   confined to Egypt. Hence they. are used to establish the position that
   the koine was, in the main, homogeneous and free from dialectical
   differences. Their style is, naturally, more elevated than that of
   letters and local documents, but they belong to the koine, and are not
   altogether remote from the more 'vulgar' Greek which is found in the
   bulk of papyri.)

   P. 317. genoito also occurs in Isa. xxv. 1, where the Hebrew word has
   presumably been taken for 'mn by LXX., though M.T. points it
   differently.

   P. 319. The spelling of the Hebrew Bible is perhaps based on that of a
   MS., no longer extant, of about A.D. 135.

   P. 321. Other cases of possible confusions are between:

   k and d, see 4 Regn. v. 19, where kvrt is transliterated debratha.

   r and v, Isai. xxviii. 10, 13, thlipsis (r) for tsv.

   r and h, Isai. viii. 12, skleron = qsh for qsh 'conspiracy.'

   m and m, Isai. iii. 10, desomen, root 'sr for 'mr.

   Cf. the strong remarks in Driver's Hebrew Tenses (p. xiii. in first
   ed.) on the worthlessness of LXX.'s evidence as between v and y, with
   numerous instances.

   P. 324. With Ien emoi of 1 Regn. i. 26, cf. ep' emoi, Isai. xxi. 2, for
   ly, "Go up.'

   (b). On transliteration, Thackeray (Gramm. O.T.G. p. 31) points out
   that it is rare in the Pentateuch, Isaiah, Jerem. a, and the Minor
   Prophets; and absent altogether from Ezek. b, Proverbs, Psalms (except
   in titles, and allelouia), and from Job, apart from the Hexaplar
   additions from Theodotion. In Isaiah, moreover, only two instances
   occur, of which sorech, v. 2, is possibly a proper name; while
   nechotha, xxxix. 2, is in a passage that runs parallel with 4 Kingdoms;
   the transliteration occurs in both places in the Greek, and in Isaiah
   is not impossibly a doublet.

   P. 327. The LXX. appear to avoid the familiar metaphor of a 'Rock' in
   nearly all cases;


   See Deut. xxxii. 5, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37; 2 Regn. xxiii. 3; Ps. xvii. 2,
   32 (= 2 Regn. xxii. 2, 32), xxx. 3, lx. 2, lxi. 6; Habak. i. 12; Isai.
   xvii. 10, xxx. 29, xxxii. 2, xliv. 8; but not xxxi. 9. Gen. xlix. 24 is
   hardly a certain instance, Heb. being different.


   P. 330. Gen. xv. 1--6.


   1. polus estai. Heb. has here Hiphil inf. abs., used predicatively.

   2. apoluomai. For this sense of the verb, cf. Soph. Antig. 1265, 1314;
   also in Polybius. Can hlr have the sense of 'depart this life'? See
   xxv. 32; Eccles. v. 15; Isai. xxxviii. 10; Ps. xxxviii. 14.

   3. kleronomesei. This sense is found also in the later literary Greek.

   4. Ek sou. Cf. Exod. i. 5.

   P. 333. Josh. x. 13. H.-P. give G.'s reading wrongly as ethnous.

   P. 336. 4 Regn. ii. 14. kai dierragesan, Luc. kai ou dierethe, Vulg. et
   non sunt divisae.

   Consult throughout this passage Burney's Notes on the Hebrew Text of
   the Books of Kings.

   prefix ain and phe in the order now usual. Conversely, in Prov. xxix.

   P. 387. The phrase chloros chortos, Mark vi. 39, is curious. It is not
   given by Westcott and Hort as a reference to the Old Testament; but,
   whereas it is peculiar to Mark's account, it is found in the LXX., Gen.
   i. 30, Isa. xv. 6, xxxvii. 27 A.

   P. 398. In Zech. xii. 10 the LXX. verb is katorchesanto, i.e. rqdv for
   dqrv (see Bp Lightfoot, Biblical Essays, p. 136).

   P. 418. Rahlfs (Sept.-Studien, II. p. 206) regards Justin's quotations
   as having been corrected by scribes from texts of the LXX.; as also
   those of the Fathers, e.g. Theodoret (p. 175) and Clem. Rom. (p. 201).
   He refers to Hilgenfeld, in Baur and Zeller's Theolog. Jahrbücher,
   1850, and Bousset, Die Evangeliencitate Justins d. Märtyrers, p. 19
   ff.: also Hatch, Essays in Bibl. Greek, p. 186 ff.

   P. 424. The question has been raised (in correspondence, by Mr R. B.
   Girdlestone) whether there are to be found any distinctively Jewish, as
   opposed to Christian, MSS. of the LXX. It is not easy to answer
   categorically. But, in view of the dates when the translation appears
   to have been made, and the fact that the latest books to be translated
   offer, in general, the smallest opportunities for changes to be made by
   Christian hands, it would seem that the translation, originally purely
   Jewish, can have suffered very little in this way. (See p. 30 ff.) For
   instance, the famous addition in Ps. xcv. 10, though widely current in
   Christian literature, has practically almost no support in MSS. of the
   LXX.; and the reading aromen in Isa. iii. 10 has actually none,
   occurring as it does in Justin, D. 136, 137. Clem. Alex. Strom. V. 14,
   auferamus Tert. adv. Marc. III. 22. All existing MSS. give what Justin
   calls the Jewish reading, desomen; while, as Hatch, Essays, p. 197,
   points out, neither reading corresponds with the Hebrew as we have it.
   In Josh. xv. again, the LXX. text after v. 59 appears to represent an
   accidental, and very natural, omission in the Hebrew; cf. xxi. 36, 37.
   It is not even necessary to suppose that the words haute estin
   Baithleem are a Greek interpolation,

   The just conclusion seems to be that, previous to Origen, the text was
   scarcely affected, if at all; and Origen's intentions were certainly
   not such as to impair the Hebraica veritas; so that if any Christian
   additions have slipped here or there into the text, they are probably
   few and slight; there is no trace of anything that approaches to
   deliberate Christianising of the text. The times when such a thing
   might have been possible were not those when the LXX. text passed
   through its main vicissitudes. See Kenyon, Our Bible and the Ancient
   Manuscripts, p. 89 ff., and his conclusion that 'the vast majority of
   the differences between the Hebrew and the Greek throughout the Old
   Testament could have had no possible partisan motive whatever.'

   See also page 479.


   P. 427. Mr Thackeray (J. Th. Stud. XIII. 49), writing on The Poetry of
   the Greek Book of Proverbs, finds an astonishing number of metrical and
   quasi-metrical passages. He now adds that 'Clem. Alex.'s text of
   Proverbs . . . occasionally preserves the metrical and probably
   original forms which have disappeared from other texts, e.g.:

   Prov. ii. 21. hoti eutheis kataskenosousi gen]

   Clem. Al. Strom. II. 19, 483^p

   chrestoi de esontai oiketores ges,

   ? orig. text  chrestoi d' esontai tesde ges oiketores ,

   Cf. Cod. V, Arm. and Clem. Rom.; also the readings of 'A.

   vi. 23 b. kai elenchos kai paideia]

   Strom. I. 29, 247^p

   hodous gar biotetos elenchei paideia,

   ? orig. paideia gar hodous biotetos elenchei.

   biotes = bios is else a hapax leg. in Prov. v. 23.

   Similarly Chrysostom is possibly right in reading, in Prov. xv. 17b:

   e parathesis moschon meta echthras

   e bous apo phatnes.'


   P. 432. Literature: add Constantinus Oikonomus, vol. IV.

   P. 442. There is an excursus on Gen. xlix. 10 in the earlier editions
   (previous to the fourth) of Cheyne's Prophecies of Isaiah.

   Th. Stud. XI. 44, referred to above, on p. 247.

   P. 486. In 1907 Professor Rahlfs developed a provisional plan for a
   scientific edition of the LXX.: the Academy of Berlin, the Royal
   Society of Göttingen, and the Prussian Ministerium of Instruction to
   cooperate. MSS. were to be collated, in Greek, Coptic, Ethiopic,
   Syriac, Armenian, Georgian and Slavonic. The Latin MSS. to be left to
   the Pontifical Commission for the revision of the Vulgate. The Fathers
   to be examined by various scholars; Dr E. Hautsch taking Theodoret. See
   Erster Bericht über das Septuaginta-Unternehmen, 1908 (Nachrichten d.
   k. G. d. W. zu Göttingen); Geschäftliche Mitteilungen, 1909, Heft I.

   See also a brief account by Dr Nestle in A. J. Th. XIV. 2 (April 1910);
   as well as his Die grosse Cambridger Septuaginta (Verhandlungen der
   XIII. Internationalen 0rientalistenkongresses, 1902).

   P. 490. Both A and B, as has been seen, show here and there signs of
   considerable Hexaplaric addition. It is therefore fortunate that, owing
   to the varying character of the books in our great Greek Bibles, this
   influence seldom affects both MSS. equally in the same passages. On
   Job, see Burkitt, 0. L. and Itala, pp. 6 ff., 32 ff. Even within the
   same book, Rahlfs finds the character of A different in what remains of
   Psalms xxx.--ciii. and at the beginning and end of the book. On Cod. '
   see Professor Kirsopp Lake's Introduction to the photograph of the N.T.
   (cf. above, on p. 130). On the text of the Prophets see O. Procksch,
   Stud. z. Geschichte der Sept. (below). His verdict is in favour of A's
   text, with Q near to it; ' he places next, and B akin to it. This
   latter text, though inferior to AQ, he considers to be that on which
   Origen worked. The text underlying the hexaplaric cursives comes, he
   thinks, between AQ and 'B, but nearer to the latter. The pre-hexaplar
   cursives approximate to A. The history of the Septuagint is 'the story
   of its removal from the maximum to the minimum distance from the M.T.'
   This account is mainly based on an excellent survey in A. J. Th. XIV.
   p. 493.

   L. Dieu (Muséon, 1912, p. 223 f.) who has investigated the text of Job
   from various points of view--see above, on p. 108--considers that A in
   that book is mainly Lucianic. This he deduces from the intrinsic
   character of its text ('corrections d'après 1'hébreu, doublets,
   remaniements d'après des passages parallèlles, corrections destinées à
   éclaircir le sens ou compléter la phrase, tendances à l'atticisme': cf,
   Rahlfs, Sept. Stud. II. p. 230, 236, III. p. 158, 172, 281 ff.), as
   well as from its associates, which are here rather curious; an
   anonymous Arian commentary on ch. i.--iii., known only in a Latin
   translation; a commentary formerly attributed to Origen, but assigned
   by Dr H. Usener to Julian of Halicarnassus; and another, in the
   Laurentian Library at Florence, attributed, though somewhat doubtfully,
   to Chrysostom. To these are to be added V, in the first, the cursives
   249 and 254, in the second, and 55, 68, 106, 261 in the third degree of
   closeness. Some of these, especially 68 and 106, are held to give a
   Hesychian text in other books; and in Isaiah, for instance, 106 goes
   very closely with A, and is, perhaps, the more markedly Hesychian. For
   55, see Rahlfs, II. p. 235.

   M. Dieu considers that A's text in Job is nearer to the original than
   that of 'B; he calls the Sahidic to witness; but see above, on pp. 85,
   108. He also adduces in support the marginal readings of Cod. Gothicus
   Legionensis: see Rahlfs, III. 158, and Notices et Extraits, XXXIV. pp.

    THE LETTER OF ARISTEAS














   [blank page]



     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION.

   The so-called letter of Aristeas to Philocrates appeared first in print
   in a Latin translation by Matthias Palmerius of Pisa (Rome, 1471). The
   editio princeps of the Greek text was not published until 1561, when
   Simon Schard brought out at Basle a text based on a MS. hitherto
   supposed to be lost, with a few readings taken from a second (Vatican)
   MS. Wendland in his recent edition (1900) has made it practically
   certain that Schard's principal MS. was Codex Monacensis 9, which at
   that time was at Tübingen and easily accessible to him. As to his
   second MS., there exists in the Library at Basle (MS. O. IV. 10, no. 21
   in Omont's Catalogue of Swiss MSS.) a MS. presented to it by Schard,
   which is beyond a doubt a copy of the Vatican MS. denoted by K in the
   present text; and a list of readings appended to Schard's edition under
   the heading 'castigationes in Aristeam juxta exemplar Vaticanae'
   appears to be a scanty selection of the readings of K. Schard's edition
   was followed by others in the seventeenth century based upon his work;
   but it does not appear that any fresh collation of MSS. was undertaken
   [1010] . Until 1870 the latest edition of the text was that which Hody
   prefixed to his work De Bibliorum Textibus, published at Oxford in
   1705. This was merely a reprint of the text of Schard, Hody naïvely
   confessing in his preface that he did not consider the work of
   collating MSS. of a work of such doubtful authenticity to be worth the
   trouble. "Non me fugit servari in Bibliotheca Regia Parisina, aliisque
   quibusdam, exemplaria istius MSS. Sed de tali opusculo, quod tanquam
   foetum supposititium penitus rejicio, Amicos solicitare, et in Partes
   longinquas mittere, vix operae pretium existimavi. Eas curas relinquo
   illis, quibus tanti esse res videbitur."

   The first step towards a critical edition of the text was taken by
   Moriz Schmidt, who in 1870 brought out in Merx's Archiv (Band 1.) a
   text based on a complete collation of two Paris MSS., which he denoted
   by B and C, and a partial collation of a third, A, which was used to
   supply the opening of the letter which was missing in B and C.
   Schmidt's edition, though a valuable beginning, is far from
   satisfactory. A full use was not made of the evidence for the text
   afforded by the paraphrase of Josephus and the extracts of Eusebius.
   Moreover a large number of MSS. of the letter is now known to exist;
   and fresh light has been thrown on the language by the papyri of the
   Ptolemaic period which have at various times been discovered in Egypt.

   The valuable help which these papyri offer as an illustration of the
   letter, shewing that the writer possessed an accurate knowledge of the
   official titles and phraseology of the Ptolemaic court, was first
   pointed out by Prof. Lumbroso. He says [1011] , 'Depuis quarante ans,
   un rayon de lumière inattendu a jailli des inscriptions et des papyrus,
   qui jette sur elle un jour nouveau; chose frappante: il n'est pas un
   titre de cour, une institution, une loi, une magistrature, une charge,
   un terme technique, une formule, un tour de langue remarquable dans
   cette lettre, il n'est pas un témoignage d'Aristée concernant
   l'histoire civile de l'époque, qui ne se trouve enregistré dans les
   papyrus ou les inscriptions et confirmé par eux' [1012] . A close
   examination of the larger evidence from the papyri now available will
   probably corroborate the opinion, to which other evidence seems to
   point, that the letter was written under some one of the later
   Ptolemies. In any case the evidence of the papyri is an important
   factor to be taken into account in establishing a text.

   Another illustration of the text is afforded by a kindred work, also
   dealing with the history of the Jews of Egypt under the Ptolemaic rule,
   the third Book of Maccabees [1013] .

   Prof. Lumbroso further supplemented Schmidt's work upon the text by
   collating the Paris MS. A throughout, and also a MS. in the British
   Museum (F), and one at Venice (G); he a1so indicated the existence of
   five MSS. in the Vatican, but it does not appear that he has published
   any collations of these Roman MSS.

   In 1893 the want of an edition of the letter was represented to the
   present writer, and in a journey to Italy in the autumn of that year he
   collated the five Vatican MSS. mentioned by Lumbroso (HKLIM), and one
   in the library of the Barberini palace (P), and revised the collations
   which had already been made of the MSS. at Venice (G) and Paris (ABC);
   at Paris he also collated the fragment Q and the MS. D, so far as was
   necessary to establish the fact that it was a copy of A. He has since
   collated a MS. at Florence (T) and another at Zurich (Z). On his
   learning subsequently that Prof. Mendelssohn of Dorpat had for many
   years been preparing an edition of the letter, which was nearly ready,
   the work which he had begun was put aside. Prof. Mendelssohn's death
   postponed the appearance of the expected German edition; a fragment
   only, consisting of the text of about a fifth of the letter with
   commentary but without introduction, was published soon after his death
   [1014] . The remainder of his work was placed in the hands of Prof.
   Wendland, who has now brought out a text on which no pains have been
   spared, followed by the testimonia critically edited, and full and
   valuable indices [1015] . The present writer had, before the appearance
   of the German edition, been entrusted by Dr Swete with the preparation
   of a text of the letter from such materials as he had at hand. In this
   second edition he has made free use of Wendland's work, as also of his
   translation of the letter in Kautzsch's Apokryphen und Pseudepigraphen
   des Alten Testaments. The apparatus criticus will show how many
   obscurities have been cleared up by the acute conjectures of
   Mendelssohn, Wendland, and their collaborateurs. For one happy
   emendation (§ 105, p. 538) the writer is indebted to the Rev. H. A.
   Redpath. For convenience of reference Wendland's sections have been
   inserted in the margin. It must be added that one early MS. (Cod.
   Monacensis 9), which stands by itself, and is probably the parent of
   Schard's edition, is unrepresented in the present text.

   The following genealogical table will show approximately how the MSS.
   which have been used are related to each other.


   The MSS. denoted in the above table are as follows:

   H Vat. 747,                   M Ottobon. 32.
   A Paris 128.                  Q Paris 950.
   D Paris 130.                  T Florence Laur. Acquisti 44.
   F Brit. Mus. Burney 34.       B Paris 129.
   L Vat. 746.                   C Paris 5.
   K Vat. 383                    P Barberini IV. 56.
   R Basle O. IV. 10 (Omont 21). S Vat. 1668
   I Palat. 203.                 Z

                                   Zurich Bibl. de la Ville C. 11 (Omont 169).


   It will be seen that the MSS. fall into two main groups, which may for
   convenience be described as the A and B groups, the A group again
   falling into two smaller groups HKA and GIM, and the B group into two
   smaller groups TB and CPSZ. The real problem in fixing the text is to
   determine the relative value of the A and B groups. An examination of
   the readings shows, in the opinion of the present writer, that the B
   group, which was followed by Schmidt, while presenting a specious text,
   is in reality based on a recension, although in a few passages it has
   kept the original readings; in the A group no correction has taken
   place, and though the text which has here been handed down is by no
   means free from corruption, yet the true reading is in most cases
   rather to be looked for here than in the revised B text.

   A beautiful MS., in clearly written cursive characters, which hang from
   ruled lines, containing coloured illustrations throughout (five in the
   Aristeas portion), ornamental red head-pieces and red initial letters
   in the margin. Single column, 48 lines in a page: size of page 14 x 10½
   in., of writing 11¼ x 7¾ in.

   The Catena is apparently by the same hand as the Aristeas, the LXX.
   text being in the same size of writing as the Aristeas, and the
   marginal Catena m smaller writing (80 lines in a page). There is one
   large omission in the Aristeas, two leaves of the MS. apparently having
   been lost. The verso of fol. 3 ends with ten trapezan (p. 530. 8), and
   leipei is written in an early hand at the foot of the page; fol. 4
   begins with men pedinon (538. 11) and ÷ is written in the margin.

   Size of page 12¾ x 9 in., of writing 10½ x 7¼ in.: 38 lines in a page.
   The leaves at the beginning are soiled and worm-eaten. The words hang
   from ruled lines: the right-hand margin is irregular, the writing going
   beyond the perpendicular line in places. The writing is upright with
   very thick strokes, clear, but rather untidy.


   R, CODEX BASILEENSIS. Basle. Codd. Gr. O. IV. 10 (Omont [1016] 21).
   This MS., written in the sixteenth century, apparently for Schard's
   edition, but only very sparingly used by him in an appendix of
   readings, is clearly a direct transcript of the preceding MS. This may
   be shown by the following instances out of many: ou KR (on cett.) p.
   5I9. 4, diathesis kathara KR (kath. diathesis cett.) p. 519. 8,

   Single column: words hang from ruled lines, 47 lines in a page: a neat
   writing in brown ink, initial letters in crimson: size of page 14½ x
   10¾ in., of writing 11 x 7 in. A hand of the fourteenth century
   (Lumbroso [1017] ) has added some marginal notes (on Theopompus and
   Theodectes, a saying of Alexander the Great, etc.), many of which are
   rubbed and almost illegible, but they may he read in D which has copied
   them. Montfaucon (Bibl. Bibliothecarum, II. 725) mentions this MS., and
   describes it as written 'manu XII. circiter saeculi.' On p. 610 is
   written a note, + isin en (?) tauta eis doxan | thu kai tes agias
   triados phi|la [? phulla] triakosia g etoi (?) t  g +.

   The rest of the Catena and the remaining matter contained in A are to
   be found in MS. Paris 132, written by the same hand as D. Omont's
   Catalogue describes the MS. as 'copied by George Gregoropoulus'; Omont
   takes this apparently from the 1740 catalogue which says 'videtur a
   Gregoropulo exaratus'; the name of the scribe does not seem to occur in
   the MS. A clearly written MS. in a hand similar to that of M (of the
   same century). Page 13¾ X 9½ in.: writing 9 x 5½ in. Another hand has
   underlined in red ink passages where there are clerical errors and has
   corrected the text to that of A. This MS. was not collated throughout,
   as it appeared certain from an examination of a few passages that it
   was a copy of A (see below).

         12.    Theodoret to Hypatius.

         13.    Catena on Genesis and Exodus.


   The portion of the MS. containing the Catena is certainly old (eleventh
   or twelfth century) and possibly a copy of H or of an ancestor of H.
   There are the same illustrations of O.T. history as in H, better
   preserved but not so beautifully painted. The writing too is rougher,
   not so neat as in H, but in the same style. The Aristeas (together with
   the letter to Hypatius and the first page of the Catena) is supplied by
   a much later hand on white shiny unruled parchment, the Catena being on
   a browner parchment, and the letters there hanging from ruled lines.
   The Aristeas is written in a single column: size of page 13 x 11 in.,
   of writing 11¾ x 8¾ in., the number of lines in a page varying from 21
   to 43. It is written apparently in two different hands; pp. 1--3 are
   written rather diffusely; from eisi de protes phules p. 528. 10) the
   writing becomes more compact and neat, with more lines in a page: with
   the words ta sumbainonta tois philois (p. 565. 14.) the diffuse writing
   comes in again. The beginning of the Aristeas is lost; the MS. begins
   with -maton o basileu (p. 521. 24.). It ends with risteas ilokratei
   (sic). This ending marks a peculiarity of the MS.; the rubricator has
   omitted to fill in the initial capital letters, hence we find ai for
   kai, ros for pros, ambanein for lambanein, etc.


   HKA. It is clear from their general agreement in readings that these
   MSS. form one group. Notice the omissions which they have in common:


   (1)    p. 564. 1. pros tout--poiesesin epiteloi (50 letters) om
   HKA(DFL) ins GIM and B group.

   (2)    p. 566. 10. estin epiteleia--diatereis tes (53 letters) om
   HKA(DFL) ins GIM and B group.

   (3)    p. 559. 19. kathos upo--dioikeitai kata (51 letters) om
   HKA(DFL)GIM ins B group.


   From the first two of these omissions it appears that HKA must be
   derived from an original (g) which omitted these lines, an ancestor of
   g having probably had lines of the length of 50 letters; from the
   evidence of GIM we deduce that this group, while connected with the HKA
   group, is not derived from g. H and A are more closely connected than H
   and K; notice 551. 18 anapto (sin sup lin) H anapto A ; 562. 20 apan H
   (t suprascr H^corr) apan A.


   ADFL. That these MSS. form a united group within the HKA group is shown
   by their almost universal agreement. Notice e.g. the readings 536. 1
   chromenoi ADFL (sunchromenoi cett.), 537. 4 eiseleluthenai ADFL
   (eleluthenai cett.), 547. 3 eulogias ADFL (logias cett.), 569. 21
   epauepausato (sic) ADFL, and the omissions which they have in common:


   539. 27. outos de exeisin--Azotion choran     } om ADFL.
   550. 21. gar on anthropos--sunestrose de panta
   554. 8.  pros euphropunen--eluthe te de


   That D is a direct transcript of A is proved by its omitting exactly a
   line of A, so that on p. 558. 9 it reads metadoremena (sic) soi
   diamene, where the lines in A are divided thus: metado|tikos on kai
   megalomeres oudepot an arolipoi doxes ina de ta proei|remena soi
   diamene. Moreover, certain marginal notes in A, which are there almost
   illegible, have been copied by D, where they are all clear: e.g. on
   553. 25 ho kai Alexandros eipen erotetheis pos en oligo megala
   katorthosen, hoti, phesin, oudepote pragmata epibalon emelethe. At 541.
   11 sumbouleuonto of A (the stroke over the o being very faint) has
   become sumbouleuonta in D. That F is a direct transcript of A is proved
   by its repeating a line of A twice over, reading at 550. 16 a men eti
   kai nun ekaston apotelein; en gar outo diatetagmenon upo tou basileos a
   men eti kai nun oras; osai gar k.t.l. The lines in A are arranged thus:
   ekeleuse ten etoimasian eis | ekaston apotelein; en gar outo
   diatetagmenon upo tou basileos a men eti kai nun | oras; osai gar
   k.t.l. Lastly, that L is a direct transcript of A is made practically
   certain [1018] by 529. 21, where L omits the words sunidein
   pragmaton--lkallonen ekeleuse which form exactly a line in A. Just
   below (530. 1) L negligently inserts in the text (where it is quite
   unsuitable) after tou chrusou a gloss which occurs in the margin of A,
   and which is quoted in the apparatus criticus.

   These cases appear to put the parentage of these three MSS. beyond a
   doubt, and their evidence has therefore not been recorded in the
   apparatus. The few deviations from their parent MS. which they exhibit
   may be neglected.


   The group GIM(Q).

   This group presents few substantial variants from the HKA text. It
   differs chiefly from that text in matters of orthography, the frequent
   use of itacisms, etc. Its retention of two lines which are omitted by
   HKA (see above) proves that it is not derived from the immediate parent
   of those MSS., while its omission of another line in common with HKA is
   proof that both groups go back to a common ancestor rather higher up in
   the line.

   Size of page 12¼ x 9½ in., of writing 9¾ x 7 in. It is written in
   minuscules hanging from ruled lines in one column containing 67 closely
   packed and closely written lines, the whole of the Aristeas being
   compressed into 5¼ leaves. The Aristeas with the Theodoret seems to
   have been tacked on to the MS. later, as there is a second numbering of
   pages (a, b, g, etc.) beginning on fol. 7, but it is by the same hand
   as that which wrote, at any rate, the first few lines of the Catena;
   the text of the Septuagint appears to have been the work of several
   hands. The Aristeas is very much stained and blotted, especially the
   first leaf, which has been in parts rewritten, but in places the
   writing is utterly illegible. In the Venice Catalogue it is placed
   first in an 'Appendix Graecorum Codicum ex legato Jacobi Contareni, Jo.
   Bapt. Recanati Aliorumque'; a note in the catalogue adds 'catenam hanc
   in Bibliotheca Julii Justiniani D. M. Procuratoris vidit Montfauconius

   It is written in double columns, the words hanging from ruled lines the
   size of page being 14¼ x 10½ in., of writing 11½ x 3½ in. The Aristeas
   and the Catena are by the same hand. The bookplate (apparently common
   to all the Palatine collection) has the words 'Sum de bibliotheca, quam

   Maximilianus utriusque Bavariae Dux etc. S. R. I. Archidapifer et

   Size of page 14½ x 9½ in., of writing 9¼ x 5 in.; the writing is in
   single column, bounded by two vertical lines, but no horizontal lines
   are visible. The contents are all written by the same neat hand in
   which the tall t is the chief characteristic; the Aristeas sheets are
   rather broader than the rest. On the first leaf is written a list of
   the contents and the name of a former owner of the MS.: 'Anonymi
   Geographia, Philosophia anonym., Palladius de rebus et moribus Indicis,
   Aristeas. Ex codicibus Ioannis Angeli Ducis ab Altaemps [1020] .'


   GIM agree in almost all cases, including omissions such as 528. 10 om
   asphalos GIM, mistakes such as 529. 14 katathekousas GIM (kathek.
   cett.), 534. 1 megalois GIM (megaloi cett.), 552. 26 dunamenon GIM
   (dunameon cett.), and peculiarities of spelling and vocalization. They
   almost always insert n ephelkustikon before consonants, write iota
   adscript, interchange o and o (proteuousa, paschomen [= paschomen],
   metapheron [= -on]) and iand e (philikoos, dapselos, tinikauta,
   prodilos), and use itacisms such as boulesthe for boulesthai, airein

   It appears that G and I are copied from one and the same MS.; their
   contemporary date and a few cases where they are at variance (e.g. 520.
   12 e paideia aute G, paideias diagoge I) make it improbable that either
   is a transcript of the other.

   M is undoubtedly a direct copy of I. With the exception of some slight
   corrections or blunders on the part of M, they are in entire agreement.
   Notice e.g. 531. 5 pros ten chresin ten trapezan IM (ten trap. pros ten
   chr. cett.), 540.7 meta IM (metalla cett:), 541. 3 gegraptai IM
   (gegraphenai cett.), 543. 25 broton IM (broton cett.), 571. 24 graphes
   IM (metagraphes cett.). At 573. 21 M omits the words kai ta akoloutha
   panta, which form exactly a line in the double-column MS. I. The
   readings of M have therefore not been recorded in the apparatus.


   We may mention here:


   Q, CODEX REGIUS. Paris. Bibl. Nat. Gr. 950, saec. xiv. bombycinus, 576
   pagg.


   This MS. contains a very miscellaneous collection of fragments
   beginning with (p. 1) an anonymous fragment on the resurrection, (p. 2)
   a fragment of Athanasius on the heresy of Paul of Samosata, and
   including (p. 111) a fragment on the ten feasts of the Jews, and (p.
   217) an anonymous work on the measurement of the earth. On p. 341 occur
   the letters of Abgarus and Christ, on p. 343 a fragment of Photius, 'de
   termino vitae et de Spiritus Sancti processione,' on pp. 351--371 the
   fragments of Aristeas, followed on p. 371 by the treatise already
   included peri ton deka eorton (here given at greater length), and other
   fragments which need not be enumerated. The Aristeas fragments are not
   a sixth part of the letter; they are (p. 351) 520. 15 inc. katastatheis
   epi tes--521. 9 upocheiria poioumenos, and (p. 353) 529. 24 inc. duo
   pecheon to mekos--537. 21 prokathemenou pros theorian. They are
   introduced by the heading epistoles Aristeos pros Philokraten
   ekphrasis. chruses trapezes en epoiesen o basileus Ptolomaios kai
   apesteilen eis Ierousalem pros ton tote archierea Eleazaron. Omont's
   catalogue merely calls the fragments 'De Ptolemaeo rege et lege
   mosaica'; the folio catalogue of 1740 more correctly describes them as
   'fragmenta ex Aristea.'

   There are 24 lines in a page; the writing is rough and untidy with
   thick strokes, and very rough red initial capitals. Some of its
   readings and spellings connect it with the GIM group e.g. 532. 28 (lian
   for leian), 534. 8 anastasin (for anatasin), 535. 4 smixin (for
   smexin), but its text bears a closer relation to that of the otherwise
   solitary Codex Monacensis. Its evidence has not been recorded in this
   edition.


   The group TBCPSZ.


   We now come to a group which presents considerable variations from
   those which we have considered. The readings of this group are at first
   sight attractive and have the appearance of representing a purer text.
   A closer examination will however, show that a certain amount of
   revision must have gone on here, not only in some common ancestor of
   the group, but also in the individual members of it. We find that
   various members of the group have sometimes corrected the text in
   different ways, that even where they are consistent in their readings,
   they seldom have the support of Eusebius, who has introduced other
   slight alterations of his own into the text, and again we find that in
   places the reading of the HKA and GI groups, which the B text has
   rejected, is corroborated by the usage of Alexandrian papyri which are
   contemporary or nearly contemporary with the pseudo-Aristeas. While,
   then, in some places it is possible that the B text has retained or has
   successfully restored the right reading, the text of this group is
   usually to be regarded with suspicion, as an ingenious attempt to
   remove the obscurities of a Greek which had become unintelligible. The
   group is here spoken of as the B group, because the MS. B is that on
   which Schmidt's text was based, and it is also the MS. which exhibits
   the greatest number of variants; but a far older member of the group
   and one which exhibits the Aristeas text entire has now come to light,
   namely the Florence MS. T, which we will describe first.


   T, CODEX LAURENTIANUS. Florence. Bibl. Mediceo-Laurent. Acquisti 44.


   According to the Catalogue of Rostagno the date of the Aristeas,
   Pentateuch and Catena is the tenth century, of Joshua and the remaining
   books about the thirteenth. It seems doubtful whether the former part
   is earlier than the eleventh century. The material is parchment: number
   of leaves 384: size of page 14½ x 12 in. There are quires of 8 leaves
   with signatures of the (?) thirteenth century. To the end of the
   Pentateuch the writing is in single column with 46 lines in a page; in
   the latter part there are two columns with 65 lines to a page. The
   writing hangs from ruled lines.

   It is written in double columns: size of page 13¼ x 9¼ in., of writing
   10½ x 3¼ in.; the writing is enclosed by vertical lines, but there are
   no horizontal lines except at the top and bottom of the page. The
   Aristeas is in bad condition, being torn and stained. There are a few
   plain red initial letters. The writing is rather sloping, and fairly
   large and clear. Schmidt says, 'This MS. has been subsequently collated
   most carefully with its original by the rubricator, when the writer
   himself had already performed this duty quite conscientiously. Hence
   all corrections of the rubricator and of the first hand are equivalent
   to the authority of the original MS.' A later hand has added a few
   headings in the margin (peri tou Iordanou, etc.). The Catena is
   apparently by the same hand as the Aristeas, but has more ornamentation
   and red initials. In some places part of a leaf has been cut or torn
   away.

   The Aristeas is written in a single column: the size of page being 12½
   x 9 in., of writing varying from 9 x 7 in. to 7¾ x 5¾ in. The Aristeas
   and the introduction to O.T. are by the same hand, a large square
   upright writing with thick strokes and red initials in the margin: the
   page is unruled. In the latter part of the MS., foll. 45--60 are
   written in double columns in a rougher hand; at fol. 61 the first hand
   begins again, and the remainder is sometimes in single, sometimes in
   double columns, text and commentary coming alternately and the order of
   books being confused (Judges, Joshua, Deuteronomy, Numbers). The
   fragments of Aristeas contained are less than half the letter; they are
   528. 17 Sabbataios--532. 17 duo men esan te, 553. 10 o de eipen

   This MS. escaped notice when the other Roman MSS. were examined and has
   consequently not been collated in full; but some collations of selected
   passages kindly made by Mr N. McLean, Fellow of Christ's College, are
   sufficient to show that it belongs to this group.


   Z, CODEX TURICENSIS. Zurich. Stadtbibliothek C. 11 (169 Omont's

   p. 1. Aristeas.

   p. 669. Ieronumou epistole pros Dextron eparchon praitor? apo romaik
   eis ellenika metabletheisa ('S. Hieronymi liber de viris illustribus a
   Sophronio graece versus,' Omont). It is written in single column, the
   size of page being 13½ x 9 in., and the writing hangs from ruled lines.
   The Aristeas portion is badly preserved; a hole passes through the
   twenty pages which contain it, causing lacunae. There are several
   marginal readings, some of which are obviously conjectural (e.g. isos
   philophronesesi, isos mallon). The Jerome is not by the hand which has
   written the remainder of the MS.


   That the above MSS. form a single group appears primarily from their
   omissions. The following lines are omitted by all [1022] the members of
   the group which are extant at the several passages referred to.


   (1) 523. 9.     enkrateis egenonto--kai ten choran (78 letters) om BTZ.

   (2) 529. 11.   boulesthai kai--distazein de (51 letters) om BCTZ.

   (3) 532. 17.   apo tes baseos--toreia kai (48 letters) om BTZ.

   (4) 533. 13.   thesin ethelen--os an tis (41 letters) om BTZ.

   (5) 547. 12.   kai kakopoiousi--trophen alla (48 letters) om BPTZ.

   (6) 548. 13.   -tas emera thusiazein--oi prospheron- (46 1etters) om
   BPTZ.

   (7) 552. 13.   genoio--te peri seauton (47 letters) om BPTZ.

   (8) 564. 25.   theou de--tois axiois (45 letters) om BPTZ.

   (9) 566. 24.   esan gar ikanoi presbeis (20 letters) om BPTZ.


   Also at 533. 4 the words pros ten tes aletheias--tethenton (48 letters)
   are omitted by T^txtSZ (C and P do not contain the passage); but they
   are inserted in the margin of T, apparently by the first hand, and are
   found in B. These omissions show that an ancestor of the group was
   written by a careless scribe who dropped several lines (averaging 48
   1etters) of his archetype. From the last instance quoted, and from
   numerous other passages, it appears that B and T bear a specially close
   relationship; indeed it is conceivable that B is a copy of T, but in
   that case it has introduced several corrections of its own, not found
   in the parent MS. [1023]

   As to the value of the readings of this group, it appears that the
   'singular' readings of B are in nearly all cases due to a correction of
   the text. Instances of these are 522. 18 the insertion of en logo
   before brachei, 525. 12 ean oun phanetaisoi ennomon B (ean oun phanetai
   cett., ean oun phainetai Eus.). The phrases ean phainetai soi and ean
   phainetai are abundantly attested by the Alexandrian papyri in
   petitions of subordinates to high officials, but the insertion of
   ennomon receives no support. Again we have 526. 13 charisterion B
   (charistikon cett. Eus.), 527. 18 andres ton tetimemenon para soi
   Andreas kai Aristeas B (Andreas ton tet. para soi kai Ar. cett.: B has
   misunderstood the genitive), 529. 18 oida gar os dapsilous tes ules
   autois ouses B (eti gar epi ta tes ouses cett. Eus.), 538. 1 schema, B
   (chuma = 'size' cett.: B has removed a characteristic word of Aristeas,
   cf. 521. 17, 567. 11). The readings of BT, where the other members of
   the group are opposed to them, are also generally to be rejected: e.g.
   525. 25 nomismata BT (nomismatos cett. Eus. Jos.), 526. 25 dunamenous
   BT (dunatous cett. Eus.): they have occasionally corrected the order of
   words, 551. 19 diateloie echon BT (ech. diat. cett.), 569. 5 ton
   idioton tines BT (tioes t. id. cett.). Where however the members of the
   group unite as against the HKA and GI groups, the reading gains in
   probability, and more especially is this the case where the group has
   the support of either Eusebius or the GI group. Thus in 526. 2
   anaspastous BTZGI Eus¹ (anarpastous HKA), 526. 6 proontas B^corrTZ Eus.
   (parontas cett.), 547. 7 ins kai poton PZGI Eus¹ (om cett.), the B
   reading is right. But to some places the whole group has been affected
   by correction. Thus in 519. 11 TSZ (the only extant members at this
   point) read eautous proedokamen eis ton proeiremenon andra presbeian,
   but the reading eautous epedokamen k.t.l. of the other MSS. is
   corroborated by the usage of the papyri of the second century B.C.
   (Paris Pap. 49 katapepeiramai . . . eis pan to soi chresimon emauton
   epididonai, Par. Pap. 63 col. 6 prothumos eautous epididonton,
   Grenfell, Erotic Fragment, etc. XLII. 6 eis te pan to parangellomenon |
   prothum]os eautous epidedokoton).

   A few instances where correction is seen at work may be quoted. At 550.
   10 HKAGI read panta dunamin eipe parestai kathekontos, ois
   sunchresesthe (-sesthe), kamoi meth umon. Panta dunamin, which is
   clearly wrong, is corrected by BTZ to pasan dunamin, by P to pant(=
   panth)a dunaimen; parestai is further corrected by BT to parestanai and
   kamoi to kame, corrections which give a grammatical but hardly an
   intelligible sentence. The slight alteration of d' umin for dunamin (a
   correction of Mendelssohn, which had also suggested itself to the
   present writer) restores sense to the passage, and the B text is seen
   to be due to conjecture. Similarly at 555. 1 B and P have corrected in
   different ways the characteristic word apephenato ('answer'), B reading
   eipe and P apekrinato: a little before (553. 21) B reads apokrinesthai
   where the remaining MSS. have apophainesthai. At 527. 1 BTZ read
   archisomatophulaka (B at first wrote somatophulaka: ton
   archisomatophulakon cett.), thus removing an idiomatic use of the
   genitive, frequently attested by the papyri. The above instances will
   afford sufficient proof that a good deal of recension has gone on in
   this group. At the same time it is clear that in other places it has
   escaped the corruptions which the other groups have undergone, though
   it is sometimes difficult to say whether a reading of this group is
   primitive or due to correction. The agreement of the group with
   Eusebius (where his evidence exists) is, as was said, sometimes a test;
   but in the majority of cases the B text is not corroborated by
   Eusebius, and in a few instances where one or two members only of the
   group agree with Eusebius, this appears to be due to a fortuitous
   coincidence in emendation. Such a passage is 527. 4 graphe BT Eus.
   (graphon cett.). In this instance Eusebius altered the form of the
   sentence by reading graphe and inserting gar after kecharismenos; in BT
   the change to graphe was due to kecharismenos ese having become
   corrupted to kai charisamenos ese; the participle graphon is
   corroborated by Josephus (epistellon peri hon an theles poieseis
   kecharismena).


   The extracts of Eusebius, consisting of about a quarter of the letter,
   are contained in the eighth and ninth books of the Praeparatio
   Evangelica (VIII. 2--5, 9, IX. 38). The Eusebian MSS. which are to be
   followed in these books are, as Heikel [1024] has shown, I (Codex
   Venetus Marcianus 341) and O (Codex Bononiensis 3643). The extracts
   from Aristeas in these two MSS. have been collated for the present
   text, anti their evidence is quoted as Eus¹ and Eus². For the other
   Eusebian MSS. the text of Gaisford (Oxford, 1843) has been used; O was
   unknown to Gaisford, and his collation of I was incomplete. The Venice
   MS. by its general agreement with the Aristeas MSS. shows itself to be
   far the best text of Eusebius; the Bologna MS. or one of its ancestors
   has been very carelessly copied, and there are numerous omissions which
   did not always appear worthy of record in the apparatus to the present
   text. With regard to the value of the Eusebian text, it may be well to
   quote the verdict of Freudenthal [1025] on the general character of his
   extracts from earlier writers. He says, 'Eusebius shows himself more
   reliable in the text (Wortlaute) of his originals than in the names and
   writings of the excerpted authors. It is true that he occasionally
   allows himself small alterations in the text, most frequently in the
   opening words of the extracts. He often abbreviates his originals,
   drops repetitions (beseitigt Doppelglieder), omits individual words and
   whole sentences, and no small number of inaccuracies of other kinds are
   also to be met with. On the other hand it is only in extremely rare
   cases that he inserts additions of his own, and the cases in which we
   meet with fundamental alterations of the text are still more uncommon.'
   This estimate is quite borne out by the Eusebian extracts from
   Aristeas, where there are frequent instances of slighter alterations
   and omissions, which the paraphrase of Josephus often helps us to
   detect. Among omissions we have 520. 16 ei dunaton om Eus. (ins Jos.
   Ar. codd.), 525. 10 kai politeuomenon om Eus. (ins Ar. codd. Jos.
   however omits the words in his paraphrase, and they may be a gloss). Of
   alterations we may note out of numerous instances 525. 24 where the
   strange word riskophulakas is altered to chrematophulakas (Jos.
   paraphrases tous phulakas ton kiboton, en hais etunchanon hoi lithoi),
   526. 17 epikrinon katestesa (a bad correction, because the royal plural
   used throughout the rest of the letter of Ptolemy is dropped), 572. 9
   akribos (ekribomenos Ar. codd.), 573. 2 kata de ten aiteesin (kata de
   ten anesin Jos. Ar. codd.). In a few cases a rather longer addition is
   made; at 544. 22 before ton sungenikon the words oute ton upobebekoton
   oute are possibly, and at 546. 14 the words epi ton poleon kai oikeseon
   dia to skepazesthai are certainly to be attributed to the hand of
   Eusebius; just before the last passage (546. 11) sunterountas tas
   archas kai mesotetas kai tleutas is an unintelligible [1026] alteration
   of the correct reading kai suntepountos. Among passages where Eusebius
   is certainly right may be mentioned 526. 2 anaspastous Eus¹ GIBTZ
   (anarpastous cett.), 542. 10 endeiktikos (endikos Ar. codd.), 547. 7
   the insertion of kai poton Eus¹ GIPZ, and lastly 541. 21. The readings
   in this passage are instructive:


   (1) pros ta di mon epizetethenta Eus.

   (2) pros di emon epizetethenta GIMZ*.

   (3) pros emon epizetethenta HKADFL.

   (4) pros de emon epizetethenton BPTZ^corr.


   Eusebius preserves the true text; the ta then dropped out, and while in
   the HKA group the reading was still further corrupted, in the B group
   sense was restored to the passage by a conjectural emendation. Passages
   where Eusebius and Josephus unite as against the Aristeas MSS. are 524.
   18 anagraphes (antigraphes Ar.), 525. 5 tetucheke (teteuche Ar.), 526.
   8 omission of the negative, ? 528. 7 the perfect apestalkamen (Jos. has
   the perfect pepomphamen: apesteilamen Ar.), 572. 20 poieton Jos. Eus. B
   (poietikon or poietikos Ar. cett.); in such cases the patristic reading
   should generally be followed. On the whole the Eusebian evidence is of
   the greatest importance; it tends to show that the GI group, especially
   if supported by any member of the B group, is nearest to the primitive
   text.

   Lastly, with regard to the evidence of Josephus, he gives in the
   twelfth book of the Jewish Antiquities a paraphrase of about two-fifths
   of the letter, omitting the central portion, namely the visit to
   Palestine, the discourse with Eleazar and the seventy-two questions and
   answers. He has taken the trouble to reshape nearly every sentence,
   while retaining many of the characteristic words of Aristeas. Under the
   circumstances it is not always possible to reconstruct his text, and at
   some of the most difficult passages his evidence is uncertain; in some
   cases the text was certainly unintelligible to him. He is however often
   useful in enabling us to detect the alterations which have been
   introduced into the text by Eusebius or the B group. It is needless to
   add that Niese's text of Josephus has been followed.

   Beside the MSS. of Aristeas above mentioned the following are known to
   the present writer, which he has not had the opportunity of collating:
   Codex Monacensis 9 (saec. xi.), quoted in Wendland's edition, Codex
   Atheniensis 389 (circa saec. xv., chart., foll. 328, Aristeas and
   Catena) [1027] , Codex Scorialensis S. 1. 6 (dated 1586, and written
   cheiri Nikolaou Tourrianou kai basilikou antigrapheos, Aristeas and
   Catena on Genesis and Exodus) [1028] .

   The collations here given are not absolutely complete. Itacisms and
   other orthographical details have not been generally recorded, neither
   have all the slight omissions of the Codex O of Eusebius; but apart
   from these no substantial variants have, it is hoped, been omitted. The
   dates of the various correctors' hands have not been accurately
   ascertained; the symbol B¹, T¹ has been used to denote a correction
   probably by the first hand or a hand nearly contemporary with the date
   of the MSS. B and T. Words are enclosed within daggers where the MS.
   reading is left in the text, although possibly corrupt: angular
   brackets denote emendations of, or insertions introduced into, the
   reading of the MSS.; square brackets [ ] signify that words found in
   the MSS. are probably to be omitted.

   to in the Venice Catalogue; but Montfaucon does not appear to mention
   that it contained Aristeas.

   [1020] The library of Colonna was bought by Jean Ange duc d'Altemps in
   1611; in 1689 part of the collection was transferred to the Ottobonian
   palace. See Batiffol, La Vaticane de Paul III. à Paul V. (Paris, 1890),
   pp. 57--59.

   [1021] The greater part of this MS. was collated from the original. The
   collation of the last few pages has been made from photographs, for
   which the writer is indebted to the courtesy of the Librarian, Dr
   Hermann Escher.

   [1022] S omits (1), (3), and (7). It has not been tested for the other
   passages.

   [1023] The divergence of the two subdivisions of the B group is seen in
   the difficult passage (531. 6) where BT omit the words oste kai ten ton
   kumaton thesin, while CSZ retain them and add pepoiesthai kath o an
   meros.

   [1024] De Praeparationis Evangelicae Eusebii edendae ratione
   (Helsingforsiae, 1888).

   [1025] Hellenistische Studien, Alexander Polyhistor (Breslau, 1875) p.
   7 f. See also the note on p. 203 on Eusebius and Pseudo-Aristeas.

   [1026] Wendland suggests that the words are an interpolation from
   Plato, Legg. 715 E, ho men de theos, hosper kai ho palaios logos,
   archen te kai teleuten kai mesa ton onton apanton echon k.t.l.

   [1027] Katalogos ton cheirographon tes ethn. bibl. tes Ellados hupo
   Ioannou Sakkelionos kai Alk. I. Sakkelionos (Athens, 1892).

   [1028] E. Miller, Catalogue des Manuscrits Grecs de la Bib1. de
   l'Éscurial (Paris, 1848). An examination of a few pages of this MS.
   which the Rev. P. M. Barnard, B.D., kindly made for the writer in 1894
   shows that it agrees most often with the GI group. Passages where it
   stands alone are 548. 15 om tou, 549. 8 poseon, 549. 21 mia phone (for
   upo m. ph.), 550. 14 proskeleusamenos, 572. 20 om ton istorikon, 573.

       Scripturae libros, quibus salutaris doctrina continetur, ab omnibus
       maculis expurgatos integros purosque pervulgari. Id nos in
       inferiori gradu constituti, quantum potuimus, studio et diligentia
       nostra praestitimus, et in hac altissima specula a Deo collocati
       assidue mentis nostrae oculis spectare non desistimus. Cum itaque
       superioribus annis piae recordationis Gregorius Papa XIII.
       praedecessor noster, nobis suggerentibus, Graecum Vetus Testamentum
       iuxta Septuaginta Interpretum editionem, qua ipsi etiam Apostoli
       nonnunquam usi fuerunt, ad emendatissimorum codicum fidem
       expoliendum mandaverit; eius rei cura dilecto filio nostro Antonio
       Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Presbytero Cardinali Carafae, et ad id
       per eum delectis eruditis aliquot viris demandata, et iam expolitio
       huiusmodi, permultis exemplaribus ex diversis Italiae bibliothecis
       et praecipue ex nostra Vaticana diligenter collatis matureque
       examinatis, absoluta sit: Volumus et sancimus ad Dei gloriam et
       Ecclesiae utilitatem, ut Vetus Graecum Testamentum iuxta
       Septuaginta ita recognitum et expolitum ab omnibus recipiatur ac
       retineatur, quo potissimum ad Latinae vulgatae editionis et veterum
       Sanctorum Patrum intelligentiam utantur. Prohibentes ne quis de hac
       nova Graeca editione audeat in posterum vel addendo vel demendo
       quicquam immutare. Si quis autem aliter fecerit quam hac nostra
       sanctione comprehensum est, noverit se in Dei Omnipotentis
       beatorumque Apostolorum Petri et Pauli indignationem incursurum.:
       [14156]1
     * Adeo Septuaginta Interpretum editio magni nominis apud omnes fuit;
       nimirum quae instinctu quodam divinitatis elaborata bono generis
       humani prodierit in lucem. Sed haec etiam ipsa, quod in hexaplis
       ita primum ab Origene collocata fuerit ut eius e regione aliae
       editiones quo inter se comparari commodius possent ad legendum
       propositae essent, deinde vero varietates tantum ex iis ad illam
       sub obelis et asteriscis notari essent coeptae, factum est ut
       vetustate notis obliteratis insincera nimis et valde sui dissimilis
       ad nos pervenerit: quippe quae insertis ubique aliorum
       interpretationibus, aliquibus autem locis duldici atque etiam
       triplici eiusdem sententiae interpretatione intrusa, male praeterea
       a librariis accepta, suum ob id nitorem integritatemque amiserit.
       Hinc illae lectionum penitus inter se dissidentes varietates et,
       quod doctissimorum hominum ingenia mentesque diu torsit, ipsae
       exemplarium non solum inter se sed a veteribus etiam scriptoribus
       dissensiones. Quod malum primo a multis ignoratum, ab aliis postea
       neglectum, quotidie longius serpens, principem librum, et a quo
       tota lex divina et Christiana pendent instituta, non levibus
       maculis inquinavit. Quo nomine dici non potest quantum omnes boni
       debeant Sixto V. Pont. Max. Is enim quod in sacris litteris, unde
       sanctissimam hausit doctrinam, aetatem fere totam contriverit,
       quodque in hoc libro cum veterum scriptis conferendo singularem
       quandam diligentiam adhibuerit, vidit primus qua ratione huic malo
       medendum esset; nec vidit solum, sed auctoritate etiam sua effecit
       ut summus Pontifex Gregorius XIII. Graeca Septuaginta Interpretum
       Biblia, adhibita diligenti castigatione, in pristinum splendorem
       restituenda curaret. Quam rem exequendam cum ille demandasset
       Antonio Carafae Cardinali, viro veteris sanctitatis et omnium
       honestarum artium cultori, nulla is interposita mora delectum
       habuit doctissimorum hominum qui domi suae statis diebus exemplaria
       manuscripta, quae permulta undique conquisierat, conferrent et ex
       iis optimas quasque lectiones elicerent; quibus deinde cum codice
       Vaticanae biliothecae saepe ac diligenter comparatis intellectum
       est, eum codicem omnium qui extant longe optimum esse, ac operae
       pretium fore si ad eius fidem nova haec editio pararetur.: [14157]1

       infinitos pene locos ex its non eodem modo ab antiquis sacris
       scriptoribus afferri quo in vulgatis Bibliorum Graecis editionibus
       ctrcumferrentur, existimassetque non aliunde eam lectionum
       varietatem quam a multiplici eaque confusa veterum interpretatione

     * Qui sunt in sacrosanctis scripturis accuratius versati, fatentur
       omnes Graecam Septuaginta Interpretum editionem longe aliis omnibus
       quibus Graeci usi sunt et antiquiorem esse et probatiorem. Constat
       enim eos Interpretes, natione quidem Iudaeos, doctos vero Graece,
       trecentis uno plus annis ante Christi adventum, cum in Aegypto
       regnaret Ptolemaeus Philadelphus, Spiritu sancto plenos sacra
       Biblia interpretatos esse, eamque interpretationem a primis
       Ecclesiae nascentis temporibus tum publice in Ecclesiis ad legendum
       propositam fuisse, tum privatim receptam et explanatam ab
       Ecclesiasticis scriptoribus qui vixerunt ante B. Hieronymum,
       Latinae vulgatae editionis auctorem. Nam Aquila quidem Sinopensis,
       qui secundus post Septuaginta eosdem libros ex Hebraeo in Graecum
       convertit et multo post tempore sub Hadriano principe floruit, et
       eius interpretatio, (quod ea quae de Christo in scripturis
       praedicta fuerant, ut a Iudaeis gratiam iniret aliter quam
       Septuaginta vertendo, subdola obscuritate involverit) iamdiu est
       cum a recte sentientibus, licet in hexaplis haberetur, aliquibus
       locis non est probata. Hunc vero qui subsequuti sunt, Symmachus et
       Theodotio, alter Samaritanus sub L. Vero, alter Ephesius sub Imp.
       Commodo, uterque (quamvis et ipsi in hexaplis circumferrentur)
       parum fidus interpres habitus est: Symmachus, quod Samaritanis
       offensus, ut placeret Iudaeis, non unum sanctae scripturae locum
       perturbato sensu corruperit; Theodotio, quod Marcionis haeretici
       sectator nonnullis locis perverterit potius quam converterit sacros
       libros. Fuerunt praeter has apud Graecos aliae duae editiones
       incertae auctoritatis: altera Antonio Caracalla Imp. apud
       Hierichuntem, altera apud Nicopolim sub Alexandro Severo in doliis
       repertae. quae quod in octaplis inter Graecas editiones quintum et
       sextum locum obtinerent, quintae et sextae editionis nomen
       retinuerunt. Sed nec hae satis fidae interpretationes habitae sunt.
       His additur alia quaedam editio sancti Luciani martyris, qui vixit
       sub Diocletiano et Maximiano Impp., valde illa quidem probata, sed
       quae cum Septuaginta Interpretibus comparari nullo modo possit, vel
       ipsis etiam Graecis scriptoribus testantibus et Niceta confirmante
       his plane verbis in commentario Psalmorum: : [14390]1
     * Quibus sane doctorum hominum quos ad id delegeram industria et
       iudicio clarae memoriae Gulielmi Cardinalis Sirleti (quem propter
       excellentem doctrinam et multiplicem linguarum peritiam in locis
       obscurioribus mihi consulendum proposueram) persaepe examinatis et
       cum vestro Vaticanae bibliothecae (cui me benignitas vestra nuper
       praefecit) exemplari diligenter collatis; intelleximus cum ex ipsa
       collatione tum a sacrorum veterum scriptorum consensione, Vaticanum
       codicem non solum vetustate verum etiam bonitate caeteris anteire;
       quodque caput est, ad ipsam quam quaerebamus Septuaginta
       interpretationem, si non toto libro, maiori certe ex parte, quam
       proxime accedere. Quod mihi cum multis aliis argumentis constaret,

     * omnibus autem libris qui in manibus fuerunt unus hic prae aliis,
       quia ex editione Septuaginta si non toto libro certe maiorem partem
       constare vises est, mirum in modum institutam emendationem adiuvit;
       post eum vero alii duo qui ad eius vetustatem proximi quidem sed
       longe proximi intervallo accedunt, unus Venetus ex bibliotheca
       Bessarionis Cardinalis, et is quoque grandioribus litteris
       scriptus; alter qui ex Magna Graecia advectus nunc est Carafae
       Cardinalis: qui liber cum Vaticano codice ita in omnibus consentit
       ut credi possit ex eodem archetypo descriptus esse. Praeter hos
       magno etiam usui fuerunt libri ex Medicea bibliotheca Florentiae
       collati, qui Vaticanas lectiones multis locis aut confirmarunt aut
       illustrarunt. Sed libri Vaticani bonitas non tam ex horum codicum
       miro consensu perspecta est, quam ex iis locis qui partim
       adducuntur partim explicantur ab antiquis sacris scriptoribus; qui
       fere nusquam huius exemplaris lectiones non exhibent ac reponunt,
       nisi ubi aliorum Interpretum locum aliquem afferunt, non
       Septuaginta. quorum editio cum esset nova emendatione perpolienda,
       recte ad huius libri normam, qui longe omnium antiquissimus, solus
       iuxta Septuaginta inscribitur, perpolita est; vel potius rectissime
       liber ipse ad litteram, quoad fieri potuit per antiquam
       orthographiam aut per librarii lapsus, est expressus. Nam vetus
       illa et iam absoleta eius aetatis scriptura aliquibus locis
       repraesentata non est; cum tamen in aliis omnibus, nisi ubi
       manifestus apparebat librarii lapsus, ne latum quidem unguem, ut
       aiunt, ab huius libri auctoritate discessum sit, ne in iis quidem
       quae si minus mendo, certe suspicione mendi videbantur non carere.
       satius enim visum est locos vel aliquo modo suspectos (nec enim
       fieri potest ut in quantumvis expurgate exemplari non aliqua
       supersit macula) quemadmodum habentur in archetypo relinqui quam
       eos ex alicuius ingenio aut coniectura emendari: quod multa quae
       primo vel mendosa vel mutilata in hoc codice videbantur, ea postea
       cum aliis libris collata vera et sincera reperirentur. Nam in
       libris Prophetarum, qui maxime in hoc exemplari (uno excepto
       Daniele) puram Septuaginta editionem resipiunt, mirum quam multa
       non habeantur; quae tamen recte abesse et eorum Interpretum non
       esse, intellectum est tum ex commentariis veterum scriptorum
       Graecis et Latinis, tum ex libris manuscriptis in quibus illa
       addita sent sub asteriscis.: [14688]1
     * omnium elegantissimus . . . cum optimis Graecis suae aetatis

     * "entweder . . . vor Theodotion gegeben" muss dahin ergänzt werden

       benützt, nicht umgekehrt": [14815]1
     * Dieser Text steht dem Cod. Sin. wie ein Zwillingsbruder nahe.:

     * Wortlaute: [14818]1
     * als Abfassungszeit wird man den Zeitraum von Pompejus bis Vespasian
       annehmen dürfen.: [14819]1

       erweisen.: [14822]1
     * dass im allgemeinen der Kirchenslavischen Übersetzung der griech.
       Text der Lucianischen (Antiochenisch-Konstantinopolitanischen)
       Rezension zu Grunde liegt ist sicher.: [14823]1
     * die letzte Columne ist nicht, wie man anfangs glaubte, Theodotion,
       sondern die Quinta mit Interlinearvarianten.: [14824]1

       griechischen übersetzung des alten testaments sind alle entweder
       unmittelbar oder mittelbar das resultat eines eklektischen
       verfahrens: darum muss, wer den echten text wiederfinden will,
       ebenfalls eklektiker sein. Sein maasstab kann nur die kenntniss des
       styles der einzelnen übersetzer, sein haupthilfsmittel muss die
       fähigkeit sein, die ihm vorkommenden lesarten auf ihr semitisches
       original zurückzuführen oder aber als originalgriechische
       verderbnisse zu erkennen. II. wenn ein vers oder verstheil in einer
