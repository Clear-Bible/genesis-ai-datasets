      Scope of the Present Publication

   In this volume are contained the thirty-seven Sermons of John Tauler,
   which form the Third Part of the complete editions published at
   Frankfort in 1826 and at Prague (ed. Hamberger) in 1872. These are the
   Sermons for Festivals (de sanctis), while the First and Second Parts
   contain the Sermons for the Christian Year (de tempore); the total
   number being 145. Should this volume of the Festal Sermons meet with a
   favourable reception, the Sermons for the Christian Year may follow in
   two or three volumes. Up to the present time only twenty-seven of
   Tauler's sermons have appeared in English, these being contained in
   Miss Susanna Winkworth's well-known but now scarce volume, to which
   Charles Kingsley contributed a preface. [1] Of the thirty-seven Festal
   Sermons Miss Winkworth translated only three (nos. 4, 12, and 31 in the
   present volume) so that thirty-four of those now presented to the
   reader appear here for the first time in English. The Sermons for the
   Christian Year were translated into French by M. Charles Sainte-Foi,
   and were published in Paris in 1855; but he did not include the Sermons
   de sanctis. They are to be found, however, together with all else that
   is rightly or wrongly ascribed to Tauler, in the Latin version, or
   rather paraphrase, by Laurentius Surius, a Carthusian, [2] which was
   based on the Cologne German edition of 1543, and which was reprinted at
   least twelve times before the end of the seventeenth century, while it
   was also translated into Italian, French and Dutch.

   Until the appearance of Hamberger's edition (Prague, 1872), the
   standard German edition of the Sermons was that published at Frankfort,
   in 1826, without an editor's name. This was used by Miss Winkworth, and
   also by M. Sainte-Foi; and it forms the basis of the present
   publication, as I have only been able to refer to Hamberger's edition
   in the British Museum. In the anonymous Introduction are indicated the
   MSS. sources on which the earlier standard German editions (Leipzig,
   1498; Augsburg, 1508; Basle, 1521; Halberstadt, 1523; Cologne, 1543;
   Frankfort, 1565; Amsterdam, 1588; Antwerp, 1593; and Hamburg, 1621)
   were based. The original Leipzig edition (1498) was printed from MSS.
   at Strasburg, said to be contemporary with Tauler, and to have been
   corrected by him. The eighty-four sermons in this edition may therefore
   be reckoned as authentic, with the exception of four, which are known
   to have been Eckhart's. To the Basle edition of 1521 forty-two sermons
   were added, the editor, John Rymann, saying of them that "they have
   been more recently discovered and collected with great care and
   diligence. Although there may be a doubt about some of them, let not
   that offend thee, for it is certain that they have been written by a
   right learned man of that age, and are all based on one foundation,
   namely, true self-surrender and the preparation of the spirit for God."
   Some of these are probably to be ascribed to Eckhart, Suso or
   Ruysbroek. Such of them as are found in this volume are distinguished
   by the mark * in the Table of Contents. Of this Basle edition it should
   be noted that it was issued in the interests of the Reformation; and
   the article on Tauler in the new edition of the Kirchenlexicon (1899)
   seems to ignore these forty-two additional sermons altogether, and to
   admit as authentic only five of those added to the Cologne edition
   presently to be referred to. Something is said below as to the sense in
   which alone Tauler can be described as "a Reformer before the
   Reformation"; but it may be convenient here to note that Luther, who in
   1517 put forth an edition of the Theologia Germanica, the work of one
   of Tauler's contemporaries, had in the previous year written to
   Spalatin a commendation of Tauler's sermons, of which, as a recognition
   of their Protestant tendency, too much has certainly been made. The
   fact that the words were written when Luther was still Prior of
   Wittenberg, and before there was any breach with Rome, should have
   sufficed to secure them from such misinterpretation. [3] Finally, to
   the Cologne edition of 1543 (the standard for all subsequent ones)
   Petrus Noviomagus, the editor, added twenty-five sermons more, which he
   had found chiefly in the library of St Gertrude's Convent in Cologne;
   and the authenticity of these is in a general way supported, both by
   internal evidence, and by the fact that to the nuns at St Gertrude's
   Tauler frequently preached. Of the Festal Sermons contained in this
   volume, eighteen are to be found in the original Leipzig edition,
   fifteen form part of the Basle supplement, and four are of those that
   were added to the Cologne edition. Miss Winkworth, selecting from the
   whole number of 145 sermons, took eleven from the original edition,
   eleven from the Basle supplement, and five from the Cologne supplement.
   Of the Festal Sermons she selected only three, her principle of
   selection being rather edification than authenticity.

   But, on the general question of authenticity, it must be confessed that
   not one of the 145 sermons can claim such as it would have possessed
   had it been written by Tauler's own hand and been put forth by him as
   representing what he said or desired to say on the occasion. His
   sermons were always spoken; and the MSS. are at best only the reports
   of those who heard him; and such reports, it is hardly necessary to
   say, do not reproduce the sermons as they actually were delivered;
   though the way in which the sermons have thus come down to us explains
   the differences of reading in various editions and also the obscurity
   of certain passages. A critical edition of Tauler's Sermons by a
   competent hand is doubtless a thing to be desired; but it would be a
   misfortune, from the point of view of edification, if, in such an
   edition, matter otherwise admirable found no place, on account of the
   uncertainty of its authorship.

   The scope of Miss Winkworth's edition of Tauler's Sermons differed from
   that of the present publication. She had learnt to admire them by
   hearing some of them read in German Protestant households as a part of
   domestic worship; and her idea was to introduce a previously unknown
   preacher to an English audience, compiling "a volume of sermons for the
   Sundays and Holy-days of the year, such as any head of a family might
   read to his household, or any district visitor among the poor." But as
   she was very properly anxious to publish in their entirety such sermons
   as she selected, she felt compelled to omit such as, either in whole or
   in part, were "too much imbued with references to the Romish ritual and
   discipline to be suitable for the Protestant common people." I cannot
   say that any of the sermons strike me as particularly suitable for such
   a purpose. They contain, indeed, many thought that have become pulpit
   commonplaces since Tauler's day, and other thoughts that might very
   well acquire such acceptance; but for such a use as Miss Winkworth
   contemplated, the sermons need more than mere translation. Their spirit
   must first be made his own by any man who is to expound it profitably;
   and this he then must do in his own language. My idea has therefore
   rather been to present these sermons of Tauler's in such a form as may
   aid towards a more accurate historical appreciation of the man and his
   teaching. I have had no thought of either pruning or adapting his
   words. He was a Dominican friar of the fourteenth century, and he held
   all the beliefs of his age and of his Church without any trace of
   reserve. The ardour of his Marian devotion is especially noticeable;
   and it would be as improper to omit this or to tone it down in a
   translation, as it would be to correct any other illustrations of his
   beliefs and practices, crude and almost grotesque as some of them
   undoubtedly are. [4] Indeed, in order to preserve throughout the
   impression of a Catholic preacher addressing a Catholic congregation, I
   have even gone out of my way to give the English translation of the
   Scripture texts from the Douai version; since, though that did not
   exist in Tauler's day any more than our own Authorized Version, it is a
   faithful translation from the Vulgate, which Tauler used in the pulpit,
   translating it into German for the benefit of his hearers. Such at
   least has been my intention; though, from inadvertence and a greater
   familiarity with King James' version, I may not have adhered to it
   throughout. To the lady, by her own desire anonymous, to whose patient
   labour the bulk of the translation of the Sermons is due, I desire here
   to record my most sincere thanks. Tauler's sentences are sometimes
   obscure because they are so long; and that obscurity the translator has
   in many cases succeeded in removing by breaking up a sentence into two
   or more; but it has not been found possible to remove in all cases the
   obscurity of the original. (See, at the end of this Introduction, an
   illustration of the methods used by some earlier translators of
   Tauler.) The version here presented will, however, be found as a whole,
   readable and easy; and it should serve to render more familiar one of
   the most notable figures in the history of the Christian Church; one
   whose teaching shows how essential is the unity that underlies a
   spiritual conception of the Christian Creed, however much its exponents
   may differ as to matters of form.

   A word must be said in explanation of the title, "The Inner Way," which
   the present volume bears. It is used merely by way of convenience, at
   the urgent request of the publishers. For myself, I had thought that
   "Tauler's Festal Sermons" would have amply sufficed to identify the
   contents of the volume for all those whom it is likely to interest; and
   that any additional title might even cause perplexity, especially to
   those who know that all the spiritual works, except the sermons, once
   attributed to Tauler, are now generally regarded as unauthentic. But it
   appears that, in book selling regarded as a business, the word
   "Sermons" bears a fatal significance, and must be avoided at any cost.
   Thus urged, I have selected a title which marks the general character
   of Tauler's teaching, and which will not, I trust, give rise to any
   misconception as to what the volume professes to be.

   Studies, II., 128) which certainly suggests that the two have a common
   source in traditions contained in some now lost Apocryphal Gospel. The
   Gnomes are at present only available in two Coptic MSS.; the supposed
   date of the treatise is c.400.

      Some Notes on Tauler's Life

   The historical criticism of the nineteenth century did not leave Tauler
   undisturbed. When Miss Winkworth published her "History and Life of the
   Reverend Doctor John Tauler" in 1857, no one had questioned, save on
   grounds of religious sentiment, that he was the "Master in Holy
   Scripture" who was converted by the "Friend of God from the Oberland,"
   as is narrated in that quaint and edifying legend. The story in
   question had, in fact, been printed in every edition of Tauler's
   Sermons, and was regarded as an authentic and almost contemporary
   document. Quetif and Echard, in their Scriptures Ordinis Praedicatorum,
   had suggested, early in the eighteenth century, that the legend should
   be regarded as an allegory; [5] and this view was supported by Weiss,
   in his article on Tauler in the Biographie universelle (1826) already
   referred to. But it was reserved to H.S. Denifle, a learned Dominican
   of our own day, to point out that the story, as applied to Tauler,
   involves grave historical difficulties, and is barely reconcilable with
   certain matters of ascertained fact. [6] His criticisms would seem to
   have settled the question; but to him Preger, a Protestant, whose life
   has been largely devoted to the study of the German mystics, and who
   was selected to be the biographer of Tauler in the "Universal German
   Biography," has made a detailed reply in the third volume of his
   Deutsche Mystik (1893); and many will hold that he has succeeded in
   rebuilding the edifice which Denifle was thought to have destroyed. The
   latter's criticisms are however ably reinforced in the article on
   Tauler by Von Loe, also a Dominican, in the eleventh volume (1899) of
   the new edition of the Kirchenlexicon; and it would be impossible for
   anyone who had not made a prolonged and independent study of the
   question to decide between the disputants.

   Moreover, the controversy is mixed up with a further question, as to
   whether Tauler did or did not submit to the Papal interdict, under
   which Strasburg (and other cities that espoused the cause of the
   Emperor Louis the Bavarian) lay for many years after 1329. The evidence
   certainly seems to point to the conclusion that Tauler, and the
   Dominican house at Strasburg, did submit. But Preger holds it as proved
   that a certain Merswin, a layman who had withdrawn from a distinguished
   civic position and led a penitential life as one of the "Friends of
   God," received the sacraments from Tauler during the interdict.
   Specklin, however, the Strasburg chronicler, on whom Preger relies for
   this assertion, also says that Tauler wrote a book (or two books) in
   which he protested against people being allowed to die without the
   sacraments during the interdict, and in obedience to it; and that his
   book was condemned as heretical. To this his Catholic apologists reply
   that such a thing was impossible, since such administration of the
   sacraments during an interdict was not prohibited by the ecclesiastical
   law at that date. It is a pity that so admirable a legend should have
   proved the occasion for so keen a controversy.

   Proceeding now to sketch the undisputed facts of Tauler's life, we note
   that he was born at Strasburg, about the year 1300, of a respectable
   citizen family, dwelling in a house "near the Miller's Bridge." At an
   early age (Preger says at fifteen) he entered the Dominican convent at
   Strasburg as a novice; and he was through life a brother of that "Order
   of Preachers," known in England as the "Black Friars." He passed the
   two years of his novitiate and the eight years of his preliminary study
   in his native city; and then, as a brother of much promise, he was sent
   to the studium Generale at Cologne for a further period of four years.
   It is interesting to note that, during those early years at Strasburg,
   the nave of the Cathedral, as we now see it, was fresh and white from
   the mason's chisel, while the great western facade was in process of
   erection. There he would have heard the sermons of his master, Eckhart,
   usually reckoned the most intellectual of the German mystics and the
   founder of German philosophy. He would have heard him again at Cologne,
   where Eckhart had the misfortune to be accused of Pantheism, but was
   acquitted after trial by the Inquisition. At Strasburg Tauler would
   also have known the mystic, John of Sternengassen, and the theologian,
   John of Dambach; and he would have studied the authors he most
   frequently quotes, Augustine, Gregory, Bernard, Hugo and Richard of St
   Victor, Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus. Logic, Scripture, and the
   Sentences of Peter Lombard formed part of the regular curriculum of his
   preliminary training; and it is supposed that, when he proceeded to
   Cologne at the age of twenty-five, he had already been ordained priest,
   and had definitely adopted that mystical standpoint in religion by
   which he will always be distinguished.

   At this date the Dominican order occupied a position similar to that of
   the Jesuits two or three centuries later. It was the nursery of great
   preachers and theologians, and royal confessors were usually chosen
   from it. At Cologne Tauler would come to know several of the more
   learned men of his order; and it was there that his training was
   probably completed. From a passage in one of his sermons: it has been
   inferred that he proceeded to Paris; but there is no certain trace of
   him in the Acta of that University; and it is more likely that he
   returned direct from Cologne to Strasburg. Neither is there any
   evidence that at Cologne he took the degree of "Master in holy
   Scripture," (a degree equivalent to that of "Doctor in Theology"); and
   this he could only have done either at Paris or Cologne. In all the
   MSS. previous to the fifteenth century he is described simply as
   "Brother John Tauler"; and this is evidence against his being the
   anonymous "Master of Holy Scripture" whom the lay "Friend of God"
   converted. Only in virtue of that indification has he been described as
   "Dr. John Tauler."

   He would have returned to Strasburg about the year 1329, when the city
   was laid under an interdict by John XXII. The validity of the interdict
   was disputed among the city clergy, great pressure being put upon them
   by the municipal authorities not to observe it. Even among the regulars
   (Dominicans and Franciscans) there was a party that contended for its
   non-observance. The General Chapter of the Dominicans admitted its
   validity; but, according to Preger, not all the German houses--there
   were about 100--accepted the decision. The Strasburg convent, he
   maintains, did not submit to it until 1339; and the friars were
   thereupon expelled for three years by the City Council. But before this
   date Tauler appears to have been sent to Basle, where, though the city
   was imperialist, the clergy were not called upon by the civil
   authorities to defy the interdict, and where, moreover, the Pope
   relaxed its observance from time to time. Here Tauler made a
   considerable stay, and presumably delivered some, at least, of those
   sermons which were included in the Basle edition of 1521. Here, too, he
   met Henry of Nordingen, a secular priest who had come to Basle from
   Constance for the same reason that Tauler had come there from
   Strasburg. He was a man of much piety and influence, and he numbered
   many regulars among his spiritual children, one of them being Margaret
   Ebner, a Dominican nun and an ecstatica, with whom Tauler had later
   some correspondence, now lost. [7] He returned to Strasburg not much
   later than 1346; and it was in the years following that his sermons
   there attracted general attention and admiration. In 1357 he again
   visited Cologne, and addressed a series of discourses to the nuns at St
   Gertrude's in that city. Some of these were presumably the originals of
   the sermons added to the Cologne edition of 1543. Four years later he
   died in Strasburg (the date on his tomb is June 16, 1361), and was
   buried in the convent of his order. He had died, however, outside the
   convent, in the guest-house of an adjoining nunnery, over which his
   sister presided. A manuscript at Colmar, giving an account of Tauler by
   one who had known him personally, describes him as "a gifted and holy
   Friend of God"; but adds that he was detained six years in purgatory
   for sundry faults, one of these being that on his death-bed he allowed
   himself to receive too much attention from his sister, "in whose
   guest-house he died." Other faults ascribed to him are that he was
   irritable, that he was wanting in submission to his superiors, and that
   he extolled too highly the "Friends of God," while towards others he
   was harsh. According to the legend already referred to, the lay "Friend
   of God," to whom he had owed his conversion, was with him again at his
   death-bed, and received from "the Master" the notes of his conversion,
   to be published after his death, describing him as "the Master,"
   without any other name.

   I have failed to obtain any portrait of Tauler, and I am doubtful
   whether any vera effigies of him exists. But I have heard of a
   conventional likeness, in which he is represented in the Dominican
   habit, holding in his left hand the Holy Bible, stamped with the Agnus
   Dei, while he points to it with his right. On his breast are the
   letters I H S and beneath them a T, an allusion perhaps to his name or
   to his preaching of the Cross.

   She followed with the deepest attention the strife betwen the Pope and
   the Emperor Louis, having great loyalty and affection for the latter,
   as her own countryman. In 1346, Clement VI. renewed the excommunication
   of Louis - Dei ira is hoc et in futuro saeculo exardescat in ipsum -
   and in the year following the Emperor died suddenly out hunting. But,
   none the less, Margaret (who died in 1351, aged sixty) believed that in
   one of her visions the Child Jesus assured her of his predestination to
   eternal life. Her diary and her correspondence with Henry of Nordlingen
   were edited by Strauch in 1882.

      Notes on Tauler's Teaching

   Only to Tauler's Sermons must recourse be had to ascertain his
   teaching; and even of these, as has been noted, a critical edition is
   desirable. The other works once attributed to him, and printed as his
   in the Latin version of Surius, are now accounted doubtful, if not
   certainly spurious. These works are: 1. "The Following of the Poor Life
   of Christ"; 2. "Exercises on the Life and Passion of our Saviour Jesus
   Christ"; and 3. "Divine Institutions," also called "The Marrow of the
   Soul." All these are spiritual works of high value, and they deserve a
   place in any library of devotion; but, as attributed to Tauler, they
   are not authentic. Such at least is the present verdict of the critics.

   Judged then solely by his Sermons, Tauler is described by Von Loe, his
   latest biographer, as "one of the foremost among the medieval German
   mystics and preachers, uniting the intellectual depth of Eckhart with
   the interior spirituality of Suso and the fervour of Berthold of
   Ratisbon." The first-named was mystical; the last-named was practical;
   Suso was both; but he was rather a director than a preacher. Tauler
   also was both, and, like Berthold, he preached for his times. Herder
   criticizes him, saying that to have read two of his sermons is to have
   read them all; but this is hardly a verdict to be accepted; for his
   method varies largely, and the Sermon numbered xi. in this volume, for
   the most part so dull and in places barely intelligible, would strike a
   critic as not the work of the same author as the Sermon numbered xv.
   which the German editors have described as "a most precious and
   thoughtful exhortation," and perhaps the best example of Tauler's
   method. Sometimes moreover he expounds a text like a homilist;
   sometimes his text is barely referred to, and becomes a mere peg on
   which to hang a discourse on a subject of which he was full. No doubt
   there are readers to whom his allegorical interpretation of Scripture
   will be distasteful. Kingsley admits that it is "fantastic and
   arbitrary"; and the method is, of course, one that can easily be
   abused, especially when the interpretation of numbers is in question.
   But it has its justification, both in the fact that it is in accordance
   with Christian tradition--it is found in St Paul, in the early Fathers
   (as Keble's Tract lxxxix. made abundantly clear), and in the offices of
   the Church, whether those for the choir or those for the altar, and
   traces of it are left in the Anglican Prayer Book--and also in the
   experience of sympathetic souls, who find light and consolation in its
   use. But Tauler's mysticism (of which more is said below) by no means
   exhausted itself in the allegorical interpretation of Scripture. To
   him, as to Keble and to Kingsley, the book of Nature was full of
   parables of things spiritual; and, beyond that again, he clearly
   enjoyed (for he was no hypocrite) an intuition of things divine,
   wherein he found more light and certitude than in mere submission to
   the dogmatic magisterium of the Church.

   Further, as to his manner, he is eager and earnest in his presentation
   of his subject; he uses homely illustrations from daily life, yet
   without loss of dignity, and when he disparages, as he often does,
   "outward works," he is saying nothing against the performance of the
   duties, even the humblest, of ordinary life; he is merely protesting
   against reliance on ecclesiastical routine, such as fasting,
   self-discipline, long prayers, and such-like; and this protest is of
   course quite compatible with Catholic orthodoxy; nor is it unnecessary
   for these times any more than for his own. But the manner of his
   sermons, as they have come down to us, is sometimes hard and even
   menacing; and readers may not always find it easy to reconcile his
   frequent use of the words "dear children" with such an apparent lack of
   tenderness and sympathy. But, likely enough, this defect of manner was
   less noticeable in the discourses as delivered, than it is in the
   reports as now read.

   Readers will also find it necessary to bear in mind that the mystical
   standpoint in religion does not by itself free a man from contemporary
   views and prepossessions. The mystic is of his own age and race; and it
   is amply evident that the articles of Tauler's creed were just those of
   any other Catholic believer of his time. There is throughout a
   spiritual element in his teaching; but it does not exclude the use of
   what we should now account popular and conventional language about the
   fall of man, the pains of hell, and so forth. True, he says in one
   place, what indeed any Catholic preacher may say, that the chief pain
   of hell is the consciousness of being excluded from the Presence of
   God; but he does not go on to suggest, as a spiritually-minded teacher
   might now, that all other language about the pains of hell, "the worm
   that dieth not and the fire that is not quenched," is merely figurative
   of that one pain, and that such language was and is necessary to bring
   home men,--to all men in different degrees,--the exceeding greatness of
   that pain or penalty, as it will hereafter be realised. He is liberal
   indeed in extending to the spiritually-minded heathen a sufficient
   knowledge of things divine. He holds that in the "inner ground" [8]
   Plato and Proclus apprehended the Holy Trinity; he things that in Plato
   can be found the whole meaning of the opening verses of St John's
   Gospel, though in veiled words. He teaches that a king, remaining such,
   may yet rise to the height of "interior poverty," if there is nothing
   that he is not ready cheerfully to resign to God's Fatherly love. He
   extols the "evangelical counsels"; but teaches also that the highest
   perfection is attainable by a married cobbler working to maintain his
   family. His doctrine of Purgatory does not differ from that usually
   held by Catholics; but he regards it more as a place for the purging
   away of self-will than for the expiation of sin. In his sermon for the
   second Sunday in Lent there is a passage somewhat in disparagement of
   the invocation of Saints. A good soul, he says, once prayed to the
   Saints; but they were so lost in God that they did not heed her. Then
   she betook herself humbly to God direct, and straightway she was lifted
   far about all media into the loving abyss of the Godhead. But perhaps
   he comes nearest to the Protestant position in his language about the
   "Friends of God." They are, he teaches, the true pillars of the Church,
   and without them the world could not stand. In his sermon for Laetare
   Sunday he bids his hearers "beg the dear Friends of God to help them
   (in the way of perfection), and to attach themselves simply and solely
   to God and to his chosen Friends." And there is a similar passage in
   the sermon for All Saints (see pp. 218-222, and cf. pp. 93 and 174).
   But, in his teaching, the "Friends of God" do not form, as they would
   have formed for the later Puritans, "the Church invisible"; they
   constitute rather a second visible Church, to which the hierarchical
   Church is in some respects inferior. Some thirty years after Tauler's
   death the Inquisition at Cologne condemned as heretical certain
   propositions of Martin of Mayence; one of which was that these "Friends
   of God" (who were laymen) understood the Gospel better than some of the
   Apostles, even better than St Paul; and another was that submission to
   their teaching was necessary to perfection. But Tauler never went so
   far as this.

   It may be added that, from the modern Christian social point of view,
   Tauler's limitations are obvious. True, that in his sermon for
   Septuagesima he exhorts his hearers to use "natural gifts" for God. But
   his conception of "nature" is a very narrow one. Rightly it should
   include, besides those natural gifts which constitute personal
   character, such social virtues as patriotism, love for the community
   and for the family, a desire to master the earth and to make it the
   seat of a well-ordered Christian society, a realization of the Kingdom
   of God on earth. But Tauler manifests no conception of anything of
   this. For the social elevation of mankind, here and now, he has nothing
   whatever to say.

   Nevertheless, whatever were our author's limitations, Preger's judgment
   on the value of Tauler's sermons is one to command general
   assent:--"Their strength lies in the fact that Tauler knew how to put
   into them his whole heart, the fulness of his moral being. So utterly
   and completely is he penetrated by love of God and of Christ, so
   happily is the sublime and unworldly zeal of the orator blended with
   gentleness and freedom, that he masters the will unawares, and lays the
   heart open to the demands he makes upon it ...His sermons will never
   cease to hold their place among the most perfect examples of pure
   German speech, of fervid German faith, and of German spirituality in
   all its depths.

      Tauler and Mysticism

   It may be convenient to some of those into whose hands this little
   volume will come, if a brief account is here given of that "Mysticism"
   to which repeated reference has been made, and to which reference must
   be made, when the significance of Tauler's teaching is under
   consideration. Although the subject is now much better understood than
   it was in 1856, when Robert Vaughan published his "Hours with the
   Mystics," a notable book, queerly put together, interesting in its
   facts, but irritating in its manner, and one that was sympathetically
   reviewed by Kingsley in "Fraser's Magazine," [9] there is still need to
   point out what mystics are not, more perhaps than what they are.
   Mystics are not dreamers; they are not fanatics; they are not fools;
   they are not a sect; and mysticism is not a religion. As a rule,
   mystics are so termed by others; they do not use the term of
   themselves. But thousands and millions of Christian believers have been
   and are mystics, without themselves knowing the word. In fact, as Dr.
   Bigg says, "mysticism is an element in all religion that is not mere
   formalism"; and it is confined to no one form of Christianity. A
   Carthusian hermit, prostrate on the floor of his cell in meditation,
   may or may not be a mystic; but so may also be a grocer's assistant who
   occasionally attends a Methodist chapel. When Cardinal Newman taught
   that in the act of faith the conclusion is more certain than the
   premises, he (perhaps inadvertently) proclaimed himself a mystic; and
   so, I think, did Ritschl, in spite of himself, when he affirmed the
   certitude of the "value-judgment" by which a man lays hold on the
   historic Christ; for mysticism is such a way of apprehending spiritual
   truth; it is a way that is neither purely intellectual, nor purely
   emotional; but one that employs, in one act, all the powers of a man's
   soul. The mystical attitude towards truth is thus in harmony with
   Matthew Arnold's lines:--


   "Affections, Instincts, Principles and Powers,


   Impulse and Reason, Freedom and Control -


   So men, unraveling God's harmonious whole,


   Rend in a thousand shreds this life of ours.


   Vain labour! Deep and broad, where none may see,


   Spring the foundations of that shadowy throne,


   Where man's One Nature, queen-like, sits alone,


   Centered in a majestic unity."

   It is true that mysticism has to do with mystery; and that is why the
   term is popularly held in disrepute. But the mysteries with which
   mysticism chiefly has to do are neither numerous nor fantastic: they
   are God, and the Soul, and Revelation; the last being the making known
   of the One to the other: and, beyond this, Christian mysticism views
   the Eternal as approached through Jesus Christ, the Door; a few texts
   from St Paul and St John sufficing to state the whole case. Individual
   mystical writers have, no doubt, gone far beyond this, and have said
   extravagant things; but the essence of the whole lies herein; and
   (again to quote Dr. Bigg), "the Church can never get rid of the mystic
   spirit; nor should she attempt to do so, for it is, in fact, her life.
   It is another name for conscience, for freedom, for the rights of the
   individual soul, for the grace and privilege of direct access to the
   Redeemer, for the presence of the Divine Spirit in the heart." [10]

   And further, most people are now familiar with the distinction between
   the dreamy, unpractical mysticism of the East and the vigorous variety
   of the same mode of thought in the West. In both cases it produces the
   same consciousness of certitude and of interior peace; but in the one
   case that tends to mere contemplation and self-introspection, while in
   the other it inspires a Tauler of a Cromwell or a Coleridge; and from
   the latter's mysticism, movements that are vigorous to-day have derived
   their spiritual energy, though but few of those whom the movements
   affect may be aware of the fact. It is also necessary to distinguish
   between mysticism as a way of holding spiritual truth, and mysticism as
   an interpretation, sometimes fantastic, of the world and of man; and
   again between this interpretation and the mystical interpretation of
   Scripture, already referred to, which is apt, indeed, to allegorise
   wantonly, though its fancies are almost always of service in securing a
   broader and more edifying interpretation for texts which, if regarded
   as mere history or legon, would lack religious significance. The
   evolution of these other aspects of the subject from that first
   mysticism, which is the apprehension of spiritual things by the soul, a
   few moments reflection will make clear. The mystic, who sees God in all
   things and all things in God, recognises more in nature than mere
   natural phenomena, and more in the Word of God than its first literal
   significance. To him every thing, every event, every person, is a
   vision from the Unseen, a voice from the Inaudible. He lives in a world
   of parables, full of spiritual significance; and, while for him there
   is a Real Presence everywhere, he finds it also most truly and
   effectively where it is most clearly discerned by faith. Nothing that
   might be accounted magical is required to produce it, for it is there
   and everywhere already. So too, in his interpretation of the Book,
   which contains, with whatever admixture, the fullest record of that
   which has been revealed to man as necessary for the salvation of his
   soul, he sees more than the mere student of the letter. In God's
   dealings with man from first to last he perceives a harmony that
   implies a foreshadowing of the last in the first, of the whole in the
   part; and in this way he can find an interpretation of spiritual value
   even in the thoughts of good men, who have pictured to themselves,
   inaccurately, it may be, as to matters of fact, God's earlier work in
   the creation of the world and of man. And, thus broadly understood,
   mysticism is now "in the air," and is becoming recognised as a force
   that makes for unity among Christians, who differ somewhat as to dogma,
   and more as to their methods of external expression. Happily however,
   its interior and reserved character will always hinder mysticism from
   being degraded, as external religion can be and is, to the position of
   a mere badge or cry of an ecclesiastical party. [11]

   Not to know anything about mysticism is, according to Professor Royce,
   not to know anything about a large part of human nature; for mysticism
   is the philosophy of experience; the mystics are the only
   thorough-going empiricists in the whole history of philosophy; and the
   realm of experience is that which is decisive of truth. A complete
   history of mysticism would cover a very large field in the history of
   the world; and that not only of the world of thought; for, in the West
   at any rate, the mystics have repeatedly built the platform on which
   great dramas have been played; and in this sense (but in this sense
   only) Tauler and the "Friends of God" were "precursors of the
   Reformation," much as the Puritans were the precursors of the modern
   Revolution. It may be quite possible to show that Tauler was an
   orthodox Catholic friar, and that his obedience to the Church was
   throughout irreproachable; but, none the less, his mystical doctrine of
   the inner and outer, of the letter and the spirit, tended irresistibly
   towards the overthrow of Catholicism, so far as in his day is consisted
   in mere formalism and obedience to external rule. The same doctrine in
   the teaching of St Paul made short work of the Jewish Law; and again in
   our own day (for there are symptoms of its revival) it will either
   destroy or will newly inspire modern Catholicism, whether Roman or
   Anglican, which, without the mystic spirit, must inevitably degenerate
   into mere Byzantinism, the religion of credulity and of ceremonial
   routine.

   The earliest home of mysticism was in the East; but before the
   Christian era it had passed over into Europe, or had an independent
   origin there. So at least is the alternative stated by Professor Royce.
   But its independent origin in the West, in the mystical teaching of
   Jesus Christ, as we recognize it in the language used by St Paul and St
   John, must surely be acknowledged as beyond question, save by those who
   hold that the Prophet of Nazareth acquired mystical doctrines in the
   farther East, perhaps by residence there; and of this there is at
   present absolutely no evidence that can be termed historical. According
   to Professor Seth, it is a mode of thought or of feeling, from its very
   nature insusceptible of exact definition, in which reliance is placed
   on spiritual intuition or illumination, believed to transcend the
   ordinary powers of the human understanding. In this sense Plato (whom
   Eckhart quaintly describes as "the great Parson"--der grosse Pfaffe),
   was a mystic. It is the endeavour of the human soul (in its own
   judgment successful) to grasp the Divine Essence, or the ultimate
   Reality of things, and to enjoy the blessedness of actual communion
   with the Highest. Thus, mystical theology is that knowledge of God and
   of things divine, which is derived, not from observation or from
   argument, but from conscious spiritual experience; and, being thus
   based, it possesses, for the individual who holds it, an irrefragable
   certainty.

   From Plato and from Aristotle's account of God's inner life, the Greek
   mysticism, as a stream distinct from the mysticism of the New Testament
   (i.e. of St Paul, and of the writings attributed to St John), passed
   into Plotinus, and so, through Philo and the neo-Platonists, it became
   an element in Christian theology; and the writer known as
   "pseudo-Dionysius" was its chief prophet in the early Church. It would
   take long to trace, so far as it can be traced, the filiation of the
   doctrine from the age of the neo-Platonists to the fourteenth century;
   and it must suffice to say that there existed in Tauler's day at least
   four Latin versions of the works of Dionysius, that of Scotus Erigena
   being the one with which he was most likely to be familiar. Dionysius
   was also commented on by the greatest scholastics, incidentally even by
   St Thomas Aquinas, who sought to deal justly with the mystics without
   endangering orthodoxy. Eckhart, whose disciple Tauler in some sense
   way, had been trained in the school of St Thomas; but he gradually
   emancipated himself from the scholastic yoke; and he is commonly
   reckoned the spiritual ancestor of Kant and Hegel. Indeed, in other
   ways and by a more direct descent, mysticism at this day largely
   affects multitudes to whom its very name is unknown. The favourite
   devotional books of all the churches, and many of our most popular
   hymns, are essentially mystical. It has been defined above as
   philosophical empiricism; but it is more than that, and much more than
   mere sentimentality. Again to quote Professor Royce:--"It is the
   conception of men whose piety has been won after long conflict, whose
   thoughts have been dissected by a very keen inner scepticism, whose
   single-minded devotion to an abstraction has resulted from a vast
   experience of painful complications of life...It has been the ferment
   of the faiths, the forerunner of spiritual liberty, the inaccessible
   refuge of the nobler heretics, the inspirer, through poetry, of
   countless youth who know no metaphysics, the teacher, through the
   devotional books, of the despairing, the comforter of those who are
   weary of finitude; it has determined directly or indirectly, more than
   half of the technical theology of the Church."

   With the above eloquent passage, written only the other day, may be
   compared Kingsley's lament, written in 1856, that mysticism was a form
   of thought and feeling then all but extinct in England. The Anglican
   divines, he said, looked on it with utter disfavour; they used the word
   always as a term of reproach; and they interpreted the mystical
   expressions in the Prayer-book (chiefly to be found in the collects) in
   accordance with the philosophy of Locke, being ignorant that these
   collects were really the work of Platonist mystics. But meanwhile, he
   pointed out, it was the mysticism of Coleridge "the fakir of Highgate,"
   that had originated both the Oxford Movement and Emersonian
   free-thought; while Carlyle, "the only contemporary mystic of any real
   genius," was exercising more practical influence, and was infusing more
   vigorous life into the minds of thousands of men and women, than all
   the other teachers of England put together. If he had also mentioned
   Wordsworth, Tennyson, Browning and Ruskin, he would have made still
   clearer how immense has been the power of our latter-day mysticism;
   while the names of Neale and of Keble, of Faber and of Newman, can
   speak for the same potent influence among those who were ecclesiastics
   by profession.

   This perhaps may suffice, if any need there was to secure or those who
   read Tauler's sermons now for the first time, sympathy with him instead
   of suspicion on account of his reputation as a mystic. There is no need
   to follow him when he becomes subtle or extravagant; but of his
   generally broad and spiritual teaching no one can doubt the wholesome
   influence. Ritschl, in his zeal for his new rational Lutheranism, is
   bitter against the mystics; yet even he admits that Tauler did good
   service in inculcating interior as compared with mere ceremonial
   religion, and in lessening the great medieval distinction between
   clergy and laity. There was in Tauler's day a great need for a revival
   of the religion of the heart--when is there not such a need?--but it
   was also necessary that the established methods of religion should be
   respected and remain intact; for there existed no other social bond
   equally fitted to hold men together. And this was the secret of
   Tauler's influence. He was able to fill the old bottles with new wine
   from an ancient vineyard without bursting them. Recent historical
   criticism may have destroyed some of the romance with which his name
   was associated. But if, as it now appears--and Harnack as well as
   Ritschl agree with Denifle in this--he was not a "Reformer before the
   Reformation," and was not the subject of a singular conversion in the
   midst of his successful career as preacher, he still remains, and will
   always remain, a striking and venerable figure in the medieval Church,
   a reformer at any rate of practical abuses, and a prophet of
   righteousness in days that were corrupt as well as stormy.

      The Versions of Tauler's Sermons

   That the editors and translators of Tauler have also been perforce to
   some extent his interpreters, may conveniently be illustrated by the
   following passage from his first Sermon for the Fourth Sunday after
   Easter, on the words Espedit vobis ut ego vadam, etc. I give the
   passage, first as it stands in the archaic German of the original
   edition (1498); then in the Latin version of Surius (1548); then in the
   modernised German of Hamberger's edition (1872); then in the French
   translation of Sainte-Foi (1855); and finally in the English
   translation of Archdeacon Hare, in his notes to "The Mission of the
   Comforter," reproduced in Miss Winkworth's volume (1857).

   In the edition of 1498; Sermon XX. fol. 60

   "Kinder yr sollet nicht fragen nach grossen hoen Kunsten. dan ghet
   einfeldiglichenn in eweren grunt inwendig. ufi lernet euch selber
   erkenne. im geist un in natur. Und fraget nicht nach der verborgeheit
   gotes. von seinenn aussflussen un einfliessen un dem icht in dem nicht

   einen ware ganzen einfeldigen glaube in einem got in dreyfeldikeit detr
   Pson un nicht manigfel digliche sundern einfeldiglichen und
   leuterliche."

   From the Latin Version of Surius (1548).

   "Et vos, charissimi, non ad subtilium sublimiumque artium et
   scientiarum cognitionem aspiretis: sed in ipsum interiorem fundum
   vestrum simpliciter ingredientes, illic vosipsos cognoscre discite:
   nihil vobis magnopere curae sit scire secreta Dei, influxus et effluxus
   illius, de esse et non esse, et quid sit animae scintilla in sua
   existentia. Non vobis commissum est scire arcana Dei. Nihil plane
   utilius est quam ut veram integram et simplicem fidem de uno Deo in
   personarum Trinitate, non multipliciter sed simpliciter et pure
   retineamus."

   From Hamberger's edition, "in die jetzige Schriftsprache ubertragen"
   (1872).

   "Kinder, ihr sollet nicht fragen nach hohen grossen Kunsten. Gehet
   einfaltig in euern Grund inwendig, und lernet euch selber erkennen in
   Geist und in Natur, und fraget nicht nach der Verborgenheit Gottes, von
   seinem Ausfliessen, und Einfliessen, und von dem Icht (Etwas) in dem
   Night (Nichts), und von dem Funken der Seele in der Istigkeit (dem
   Wesen der Seele in ihrem Seyn): denn Christus hat gesprochen: "Euch ist
   nicht noth zu wissen von der Heimlichkeit Gottes." Darum sollen wir
   halten dem wahren, ganzen, einfaltigen Glauben, an den einem Gott, in
   Dreifaltigkeit der Person, und nicht mannigfaltighich (nicht mit
   verwirrender Spitzfindigkeit), sondern einfaltiglich."

   From the French translation of Sainte-Foi (1855).

   "Il ne s'agit point, mes enfants, d'affecter de grands airs. Entrez
   simplement dans votre fond; apprenez a vous connatre tels que vous
   etes, et spirituellement et naturellement: ne cherchez point a
   connaitre les secrets de Dieu, tels que le flux et le reflux de I'etre
   au non-etre, l'essence de l'ame. Car le Christ a dit que vous n'avez
   pas besoin de connaitre les secrets de Dieu. Ayons une foi simple,
   vraie et entiere en un seul Dieu en trois personnes, en un Dieu
   parfaitement simple, exempt de toute multiplicite."

   From Archdeacon Hare's "Mission of the Comforter," apud Winkworth
   (1857).

   "Children, ye shall not seek after great science. Simply enter into
   your own inward principle, and learn to know what you yourselves are,
   spiritually and naturally, and do not dive into the secret things of
   God, asking questions about the efflux and reflux of the Aught into the
   Naught, or the essence of the soul's spark; for Christ has said: "It is
   not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put
   in His own power." Therefore, let us maintain a true, entire, simple
   faith in one God in a Trinity of Persons, and yet not as manifold but
   as one and simple."

THE INNER WAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  SERMON I

      ON THE FEAST OF ST ANDREW THE APOSTLE

   Of Christ as our Master, and of the good things He will teach us in a
   few words, such as will lead us on to the highest Perfection. Then, of
   where His Dwelling is, how and where we may find Him, Who calls and
   invites us all to come and see; as is clearly shown in what follows.

   Rabbi (quod est interpretatum Magister) ubi habitas? dixit eis: Venite
   et videte.

   Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest
   thou? He saith to them, Come and see.

   We read in St John's Gospel that St John the Baptist was standing, and
   two of his disciples, (one of them being Andrew, Simon Peter's
   brother), and, when he saw Jesus pass by, he said: "Behold the Lamb of
   God." The two disciples heard that, and saw them following, and said
   unto them: "What seek ye?" They said unto Him, "Rabbi (which is to say,
   being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?" He saith unto them;
   "Come and see."

   These words teach us three things, first, the overflowing Wisdom of
   Christ in the words of the Master, secondly, the Dwelling-place of His
   inscrutable Being, the stronghold of all beings, for they said: "Where
   dwellest thou?" and thirdly, the Comfort given to us by the invitation
   of God to seek Him in spirit, in the resting-place of His Godhead, and
   to learn at the Source of wisdom, that is, in the school of the Holy
   Trinity. He thus speaks of it: "Come, O soul, abide with Me and in Me;
   and look that thou mayest learn; I will open unto thee the depths of My
   Divine Heart, that thou mayest learn and see all that is for thine
   eternal good."

   Now listen first to the Master: O Master, teach these daughters for me,
   that not one of them may remain amongst the five foolish virgins. Then
   He answered and said: Daughter, learn of Me that thou mayest be meek
   and lowly of heart, as He also said to St Andrew and the other
   disciples. Now, if thou bethinkest thyself again, this teaching is too
   hard for me; for sloth, care, anger, cowardice and such-like resist me
   and afflict my heart, so that I lose all meekness of spirit. Christ our
   Master replied: "How much will it help thee, O man, if in thy service
   thou gainest the whole world and losest thine own soul?" For from
   thence will many sorrows come upon thee, agitation of mind, anguish and
   bitterness of heart, vexation in all good works, indolence of mind,
   whereby the soul loses all meekness of temper. Thus it comes to pass
   that the overflowing Spirit of Christ cannot pour joy or consolation
   into the soul; for His tenderness cannot suffer the bitterness of thy
   soul; for He is sweeter than honey. Therefore he that will have nought
   to do with the deceitful comfort of man must receive the sweetness of
   this Spirit. And therefore, dear child, begin manfully, follow this
   Master, and cast thyself down before Him in the depths of humility, and
   say in thine heart: "Lord, I am the least of all the creatures that
   Thou hast made," and compose thyself in meekness of spirit; and then
   shalt thou know that God is a short word which has a long meaning.
   Exercise thyself diligently therein, grow not weary; and then shalt
   thou perceive that which before was hidden from thee.

   At another time the soul will be attracted by the Dwelling-place of the
   Divine Nature of our Master. Now, know that this question is one sought
   out by all creatures; and therefore they long for the same nature
   themselves, that they may find out the Nature of God; for all natural
   works are but a seeking after and a questioning after the
   Dwelling-place of God. If it were not so, the heavens and the elements
   could no longer exist. Dear child, what askest thou outside thyself,
   and why seekest thou God in the strange lands of mortal things? Thou
   canst not truly find Him; they all deny Him, and point thee away from
   themselves. "We are not God," they say. But Augustine writes: "Exalt
   thyself above us to the things eternal: for there is God."

   Now, mark that God may be found in many ways in which the soul receives
   instruction. First, the soul finds God her Creator on the heights of
   penance or penitence. Therefore the soul must, above all things, exert
   all her strength to subdue her own free will, ready, for God's sake, to
   learn to give up all things both great and small, to do hard penance,
   and to punish herself for following the will she had forsaken. The more
   the soul exercises herself in these works, the more will she find God
   in her, and herself in God. This is shown in the Book of Love; for the
   Well-beloved says: "I will get me up to the mountain of myrrh, and will
   speak unto my love." The mountain of bitter myrrh is the height of the
   exalted spirit, which transforms into bitterness the desire for all
   personal gratification and deceitful delights in all things that are
   not according to God's Will. Thus God speaks in spirit to the soul:
   "Thou art all fair my love, pure and undefiled, there is no spot in
   thee." But he who lives according to his own will, for his own
   pleasure, cannot thus find God, but will find Him as his adversary in
   all his works. Thus man will spoil all that he begins; for the works of
   the flesh will help but little, if the will and the affections of the
   heart are not first subdued. A Psalm, said by one who has subdued his
   will, is worth many Psalms: that is, the least work done by such a man
   is more pleasing to God than the greatest work done by a man who
   follows his own way.

   At another time man finds God in the wilderness, in the burning bush,
   as Moses found Him. The bush in the wilderness signifies such a temper
   or spirit that, withdrawn and estranged from all creatures, puts forth
   leaves or blossoms on the heights of the Eternal Godhead. As the Divine
   Being comprises within Himself three Persons, so also this spirit has
   laid hold of God in His threefold powers, as the bush laid hold of the
   flames in its blossoming branches; and this is of grace. This putting
   forth of leaves causes the soul to grow steadily in light, in godlike
   virtues, day by day without ceasing, until she, with the vision of
   angels, beholds God in Zion. Now, mark, in the measure that thou hast
   found God, in that measure also wilt thou find in thyself the divine
   training and virtues--more to-day than yesterday. But he who will thus
   find God here, must cast off all carnal desires, and, with Moses, he
   must come under the dominion of self-restraint and the light of reason;
   for flesh and blood cannot posses the Kingdom of God. I believe, dear
   children, that nearly all your daily shortcomings proceed therefrom;
   that ye follow by word or deed the sudden impulses that thrust
   themselves into the heart from without, before the light of
   self-restraint can shine therein.

   Thirdly, God may be found on the mountain, in the cloud; for the union
   (Testament) of Divine Light and of the commandment was written on the
   stone by the finger of God. The mountain is like a high-minded,
   large-hearted man, who has no pleasure in any of his works, neither can
   he find any rest in them, unless, like St Paul, he is confirmed in all
   his works by an express sign of the Will of God; so that the will of
   the soul does not even carry on human actions according to his own
   will, but after the manner appointed by the Divine Will, divinely. Thus
   the soul by her works sanctifies the body, so that when the body does
   the soul does also; and again, on the other hand, the works of the
   Divine Will and the works of the soul are at one; so that the soul can
   say: I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; I work, yet not I, but
   the power of Divine Being worketh in me. This takes place in the cloud,
   in the eternal splendour of the Divine Light, for the light of all
   creatures is as night compared with the Divine Light.

   Then God may be found in the cave with the prophet Elias. We read that
   the prophet came into the wilderness, and that in his soul he longed
   that he might die, for he had become weary in spirit with the turmoil
   of this world. While he slept, an angel came, and placed at his head a
   cake baken on the coals and a pitcher of water, and bade him arise and
   eat, because he had still a long way before him that he must go. And he
   went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights, until he
   came to the place where he found God.

   Then a strong wind came rushing by, which rent the rocks and the
   stones; but God was not in the wind; for God shows the spirit which is
   moved by stormy winds to be like those which Daniel saw contending in
   the sea of this world; that is in a worldly heart, in inordinate fear,
   hope, joy and scorn; for all these things blind the light of the spirit
   with which a man ought to seek after God. The stormy wind also
   signifies to us the restless heart of a man, who in all things, both in
   his words and works, behaves so unkindly and impatiently towards his
   fellow Christians, that it might grind the stones to powder; that is,
   that large-minded men are often robbed of their soul's peace thereby.
   Dear children, with God's help, beware of such violence. Keep watch
   over yourselves; subdue your unmortified nature, that it may not break
   out as violently as that of the wild, untamed beasts. It is indeed a
   dreadful thing to see such a man, endowed with reason, to whom God of
   His goodness has given so much light, and in whose nature He has
   implanted that kind of courage which enables him even to tame the wild
   beasts, if he chooses to exert his will, and follow the promptings of
   his own integrity. Alas! sometimes we are even wilder than the bears
   and lions, and a disgrace in the sight of God our Creator; living
   contrary to the nature He gave us, as though the light of His
   countenance had never shone upon us. I tell you in truth that we shall
   have to give an account to God for all that we ruin by such storms. It
   may be that we shall ruin ourselves (as often happens with the
   wrathful) or our neighbour, who is not only disturbed thereby, but also
   angered, and hindered in much that is good--and of this we are guilty.
   Then, when we say it grieves us, but it is our nature, and we are
   obliged to do it, we are excusing ourselves falsely, and we never learn
   to die unto ourselves. Verily, if we turned to God in earnest fervent
   prayer and humble submission, these infirmities of our nature would not
   overpower us, nor, as we say, oblige or force us to commit such faults.

   Then came a fire, and God was not in the fire. Fire is a thing which
   can never say "Enough;" and it represents the heart of a man who is
   never satisfied, either with his goods or with the gifts of God; but is
   always burning to increase without measure those things which are
   neither divine nor pure; desiring to receive comfort or other temporal
   things, and to find love and pleasure in them. All this is a sign that
   the Spirit of God is not there. I mean also all those people who make
   light of and belittle all the gifts of God, as though God had never
   done them any good, and who say: "Why did God make me? since I am so
   empty and barren of all that is good;" and who do not perceive that God
   has preserved them from many a fall, and protected them from many sins
   into which they would have fallen, if He had not so carefully watched
   over them, and called them away from the world to a spiritual state, in
   which they might have been pillars of all Christendom, if only they had
   lived in accordance with that state.

   I tell thee, dear child, that such unthankfulness might well have dried
   up the springs of love, of Divine Grace. Therefore, I beseech you, by
   the Eternal Love of God, that ye be not quickly moved by the desire for
   these things, as I have taught you all, with heartfelt earnestness, and
   as God knows; and if any other spirit teach you otherwise, it is at the
   peril of your salvation in the sight of God; as St Paul says to the
   Galatians: "If any man preach to you a gospel beside that which we have
   preached to you, even though it were an Angel from heaven, let him be
   anathema."

   There came a still small voice, like unto the sweet breezes of May; and
   in that voice came God; for so saith the Scripture. This signifies to
   us one who walks with God, in the eternal words of God, and whose
   thoughts and words are holy according to the Word of God, and whose
   longing spirit communes with God. Then it is that God comes; for in
   such spiritual sunbeams a steady blessed light is borne in upon the
   soul from God. They are not worthy of this blessedness, who, by strange
   forms of man's words (or even of an Angel, As St Paul says) are drawn
   away from the good desires they had received from God. This it is that
   the soul longeth after in the Book of Songs, when she says to God that
   the north wind should depart and go away; meaning thereby all that
   entereth into the spirit from the flesh, from whence all evil comes. So
   saith also the prophet Jeremias; for he saw that in the seething-pot
   all the budding spiritual gifts of God boiled and withered away when it
   was turned towards the north wind. Then his spirit was troubled within
   him, and he could no longer hold fast to the inner savour of the north
   wind. Therefore, when the soul longs for God, she says: Come, O south
   wind, (for it is sweet) blow through my garden, and let the aromatical
   spices thereof flow; that is, that my works may have a godly savour.

   Fourthly, God is found above the Angels; for the soul must be exalted
   above all Angels (though by nature below the Angels) if she would find
   God. Therefore she finds Him in the Father; for thus the soul must
   bring all her works, free from all self-seeking, as the Eternal Word
   uplifts Himself eternally to God, if she would find Him, as he was
   found by the soaring Seer of God, John the Evangelist, when he said:
   "In the beginning was the Word." Then Andrew, and the loving souls that
   were with him, ask with earnest longing: "Master, where dwellest Thou?"
   John answers: "In the Beginning was the Word;" for in words we shall
   not find God, if we do not lift up our souls in the Beginning.
   Therefore we must pierce through all things that are beneath God and
   are not God, and the Beginning (from which we have our being) seek
   earnestly again; for therein alone is our dwelling and the future
   resting place of our eternal bliss. This must be done by turning
   earnestly to the vision of the Divine Being and union with Him. As He
   said to those two disciples: "Come and see;" as though He had said:
   Come, that is turn away from the things by which ye are inordinately
   troubled and absorbed, that hinder your eternal peace; for ye must be
   emptied of all works, understanding and carnal desires. And see that ye
   come to the knowledge that God the Lord is empty and bare of all; so
   that your spirits may be guided to that pure and holy Being. For of
   necessity the soul must be empty and bare of all, that would enter into
   the secret Presence. Therefore man must divest himself of all those
   things of which he is conscious. Dionysius said to Timothy: "O dear
   friend, we must no longer listen with our outward ears to the sweet and
   loving words of our dear master, Paul; but we must go to God, emptied
   of all things." This we can only do when our eyes are blinded and our
   inmost desires are raised on high, in order that we may learn to know
   His hidden Unity. May God help us all to this. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SERMON II

    ON ST BARBARA'S DAY, OR THAT OF ANY OTHER HOLY VIRGIN

   Of some ways by which man may with certainty attain to Union with God,
   and may also have unceasing Communion with Him. How he may have peace
   with the world, the evil enemy and his own flesh.

   Dilectus meus loquitur mibi, surge, propera, amica mea.

   "My beloved speaketh to me: arise, make haste, my love."

   Thus spake the Bride in the Book of Love. Now, he who wishes to be the
   friend, and to know whether he be the spouse of our Lord, must take
   note of the following marks, and see whether he possesses them. If he
   possesses them, then he is, undoubtedly, a chosen spouse.

   The first is that he must have peace with our Lord, so that no created
   being can disturb his inner peace. Thus saith the prophet: "He will
   give you true peace in this place." [12] The spouse of our Lord must so
   comport herself, that she readily renounces all things in humble
   confidence, retaining her divine peace unimpaired within, and
   renouncing all things in Him and by Him. Now wouldest thou ask, with
   whom thou shalt have peace? With the world, the enemy, and thine own
   flesh. But how? With the world, by not heeding what the world may do
   unto thee, either taking thee or leaving thee; to this thou mayest
   attain with patience.

   Secondly, that thou mayest be at peace with the enemy; but man can
   scarcely ever attain to this. The enemy is constantly striving with
   him, and is always interfering in all man's works and actions in order
   to hinder him. There is nothing by which man can so completely quench
   the fiery darts of the enemy as by fervent and devout prayer; for it
   burneth and chaseth him away, and forceth him to flee with all his
   lusts. Therefore, when man is conscious of the fiery arrows which are
   shot at him, and which would deprive him of his spiritual peace, let
   him at once betake himself to secret prayer with all his might, and
   take no heed of hindrances; and thus he will be rid of all hindrances,
   while nothing more grievous can happen to the enemy. Thus we read of St
   Bartholomew, that he prayed, and then the devil cried our: "Oh, thou
   burnest me with thy prayers, and thou hast bound me with fiery bands."

   Thirdly, thou must have peace with thyself. But how? Thou must in all
   things subject thy body to thy spirit, that in all things thou mayest
   have dominion over it, that it may not hinder the in any work that God
   requires of thee. Thus did the holy saints: for they had dominion over
   their own bodies, and trained them so well, that that which the spirit
   desired, the body sprang forward to do, as though it would say: "Here I
   am before thee." We read that it was so with the humble Francis. There
   are four things that a man must do, in order to acquire this dominion
   over his own body. First, thou must deprive thy body of all that
   pleases it, whether eating, drinking, sleeping or waking, and of all
   comfort. When thou seest that it is ready to rebel, bridle it with a
   discipling that is still more severe. Secondly, thou must renounce all
   thirst for and all the consolation of the world, and all worldly things
   and cares. Let the dead bury their dead; follow thou God. If thy friend
   dies; or joy, grief, honour or riches, or whatever it may be, is thy
   portion or comes to thee, bear all patiently in God. A saint once said:
   "With whomsoever thou rejoicest, and with whomsoever thou sorrowest,
   with him wilt thou also be judged." St Paul says: "Reckon yourselves to
   be dead unto the world." The dead man careth not whether he be praised
   or blamed, whether goods are given him or withheld. A dead or a dying
   man careth nothing for gold or jewels, for honour, friends, joy or
   consolation. Thou must do as one of the old Fathers did, who dwelt in a
   wood. His own brother came to him and said: "Dear brother, I am in
   great distress; a cart of mine, laden with goods, has fallen into the
   water, help me to drag it out;" and he cried and wept and besought him
   urgently. The old Father replied: "Go, and ask that brother, who still
   dwells in the world, for help. Why comest thou to me?" Then the man,
   who was a merchant, said: "That brother has been dead a whole year."
   Then said the old man. "So have I been dead for twenty years;" and thus
   he dismissed him, and troubled himself no more.

   Thirdly, thy mind must be always fixed on God. Thou must be always in
   the Presence of God. Verily, if thou desirest to have the Creator of
   all creatures, thou must renounce all creatures; for it cannot be
   otherwise, but only insomuch as thy soul is emptied and bared; the less
   of the creature, the more of God: this is but a bargain. St Augustine
   says: "That man is far too covetous who is not satisfied with God; for
   what canst thou desire that thou canst not find in Him? Remember that
   whatever such a heart can desire is to be found a thousandfold in Him.
   Desirest thou love or faithfulness, or truth, or consolation, or His
   constant Presence?--all, all can be found without measure in Him.
   Desirest thou beauty? He is of all the most beautiful; desirest thou
   riches? He is of all the richest; desirest thou power? He is of all the
   most powerful. Whatever thy heart can desire, may be found a
   thousandfold in Him; for in God alone canst thou find the best
   blessings." Therefore drive out all creatures with all their
   consolations. Say: "Get thee away: thou art not He Whom I seek; Whom I
   desire, Whom I love." Whether it be honour, or riches, or joy, or
   friendship, say: "Get thee away, flee from me, let me alone, let me be,
   I heed thee not."

   Whence comes it that God is so strange to thee, and that His loving
   Presence is so often lost or withheld? There is but one reason; that
   thy mind is not emptied and bared, and that thou troublest thyself
   about the creature, and art corrupted thereby. St Bernard says
   contemplation is nothing else than a cleaving to God, a forgetfulness
   of all earthly things. St Augustine says: "He can contemplate who is
   free from all earthly thoughts, and thinks of the things that are of
   God." and he also says: "O good Jesus, my soul longs unspeakably for
   Thy love. I beseech Thee that I may be enraptured with the vision, the
   Cross, and the most holy sweetness of Thy Humanity. May I be able to
   withstand the vanity and the temptations of the world, and long to be
   caught up into heaven, to fathom the mystery of the Sacraments of God.
   May I so increase in spiritual things that I may be caught up, as it
   were, to gaze on Thy Divine and Holy Trinity, so that in all my works I
   may acknowledge Thy Divine Will, and be united with Thee. And, though I
   sometimes let down to the first or second stage, may I have no
   difficulty in rising up again; so that, when I see or hear of earthly
   things, I may not heed them, but die unto them and live alone unto
   Thee. There is one thing that thou must know; wert thou only freed from
   the likeness of the creature thou mightest have God unceasingly; for He
   could not refuse thee, either in heaven or in earth. He must come to
   thee. Had He sworn, He must change His word, and come to thee, and
   completely fill thy soul, if He found it empty; for, do what thou wilt,
   as long as the creature reigns in thee, thou must do without God and
   remain in vanity. If thou withholdest the least part of thyself from
   Him, assuredly He will take much from thee of that which He is, an
   immense portion.

   There was once a fair and beautiful woman, who bare a child, that was
   as black as a Moor. Master Albertus was told of this great trouble. He
   found a picture of a Moor that the woman had seen and he said to her:
   "Woman, I have found the father of your child." And he compared the
   matter to a hen that was set in sight of a sparrow hawk, and all her
   young were fashioned after the likeness of sparrow hawks. Thus all who
   are born after the Divine Likeness are divine; and all that are born
   after the flesh are carnal.

   Fourthly, thou must subdue thy natural senses, and at all times hold
   the mastery over them; thou must see, and yet not see, and never raise
   thine eyes, nor listen with thine ears, nor open thy mouth, without
   good cause. Thy hands, thy feet and all thy members must never be
   allowed their own way. Thou must guard them carefully and keep them
   securely, that nothing may suggest itself to them, or be heard or seen
   by them that is not divine. For, St Augustine says: "We must die and
   yet not die, we must keep under our nature and our senses by force."
   Then God will rule over us, and without doubt we shall also rule over
   ourselves. Amen.

  SERMON III

      On the Conception of Our Lady, also on Her Birth

   How men, when they are advancing, may learn to know their infirmities
   and secret evil inclinations; how they may die unto them and be freed
   from them; whether it be from the delights of things pertaining to the
   senses or the mind, or to the powers of the soul, or whatever else it
   may be. How the likeness of past habits must be driven out by the
   Likeness of the Life of Jesus Christ, so that men may come to
   understand with all the saints, the Height, the Depth, the Breadth and
   the Length of God.

   Transite ad me, omnes qui concupiscitis me.

   "Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.
   For my spirit is sweet above honey and the honeycomb."

   Dear children, in the last sermon on these words, which were spoken (of
   the Virgin Mary) by the Eternal Wisdom, I told you that these words
   referred to our Lady, whose dignity and honour can in nowise be
   expressed by man in words, for they surpass all knowledge in value. I
   described the works and ways which were necessary to the man who,
   rising up, desired to enter into the way of truth; then, what was
   necessary to him during his progress; and then, how the perfect man
   might arrive at the goal, and what his end would be.

   I told you how man must first put away all crying sins, such as pride,
   impurity, covetousness, anger, and all the evil growths of the world,
   with all foolish desires; and, above all, everything that pertaineth to
   the flesh, whether of things animate or inanimate. In short, the man
   who does not turn bravely to God with all his heart and with all his
   mind, who does not love God from the bottom of his heart, and intend
   above all things to serve Him, and to be found at his death in Him,
   will never come to God; even though, as St Paul says, he were to do so
   as many good works as all men now living, and were so wise that he
   spake with the tongue of Angels, and allowed his body to be burned, and
   gave all his goods to feed the poor. Now, how have they turned to God
   with all their love and with all their minds, who give their hearts, of
   their own free will, to created beings, although they know that they
   are thus occupying the places where God should dwell, and of which they
   are consciously depriving Him? God careth not for works, when He is
   deprived of the heart and of love. Of what use is the chaff to Him, if
   another has the wheat?

   Now when these grosses sins are cut off in the growing man with a
   diligence which is like unto a sharp steel, and of which I have already
   spoken, he will be sharpened like a sharp knife, and whetted by the
   great righteousness of God, which lets no word nor deed, however small
   they may be, pass by unpunished. He must remember the secret and
   terrible judgments of God; for no one knows how it will be with him;
   for no one knows whether he is the subject of God's anger, or of His
   favour. Now, when this man has begun be cutting off all wicked vices,
   he must then take heed of that which is left in the bottom of his
   heart, namely the inclination thereto, which is the result of old
   habits. For these old habits make excuses for themselves, and strive to
   appear as though they were virtues; and yet they are only counterfeits;
   when pride, which a man fondly imagines he had overcome, lies hidden in
   his heart. For instance, care about dress and such-like matters
   remains, and it is called cleanliness; or pleasure is found in things
   pertaining to the senses, such as food or drink; and it is called
   necessity. Then some men are so angry and wrathful, longing to inform
   against every man and to judge him; and they are so suspicious and
   impatient; and then they call it justice; while pure laziness is called
   illness.

   Children, if you insist on any of these things, and glory in your own
   kindness and in your own judgment, and in your own lofty and wise works
   and ways--when the end comes, the Devil will come and take away those
   with him who fondly imagine that all is well with them. This will be
   the case, especially, with those who conceal their pride beneath the
   appearance of humility, and who, wise in their own conceit, should of
   right stand under Lucifer's banner; for the higher they stand in their
   own esteem, the deeper will they fall into the abyss.

   Children, look to yourselves. This is not a question of small things.
   If ye were to be kept in a hot room a night and a day, ye would think
   it very hard; I say nothing of burning heat for many a year, or perhaps
   for all eternity. Therefore commune with your own selves, for the
   kingdom of God is within you. See with whom ye associate, with whom ye
   readily stay; and examine the reasons and the tendency to all evil
   habits. For if a man gives way to a fault for a year or two, that fault
   takes such deep root in his heart, that he can scarcely overcome it
   with all his might. Therefore young men should guard themselves
   carefully, so that no evil tendencies may take root in them. They must
   root out all infirmities at the beginning, when it is far more easy to
   do so than later. Now there are four things, especially, which man must
   guard against, four powers which are so injurious and evil that they
   are like jagged teeth.

   The first is the love of visible things; and in this lies the strength
   of desire. It is scarcely possible to imaging or describe the harm men
   do to themselves thereby. Men who desire to be good, begin with this or
   that, with one thing or another, and are so occupied with the
   seed-sowing, that they do not keep to the full truth. They do not look
   into their own hearts, which are closed up, like some unknown thing a
   thousand miles off; there outward and visible things are of more
   importance to them. Thus they go on avoiding themselves, so that they
   do not know where they are.

   The second power is anger. This is used inordinately; for it should
   never be used outwardly, except in those things which are displeasing
   to God. In itself it is a noble power; but in many men it produces very
   evil growths. They suddenly fall with vehemence on anything whatsoever;
   and in false righteousness desire to censure it, to judge of all works
   and ways; and thus they deceive themselves and other men with their
   violence, their unrestrained and bitter anger, and their loud, harsh,
   unkind and angry words.

   The third evil is to be found in the power of the light of reason, to
   which many men trust to their own hurt. They trust in their own reason
   and glory in it, and they compare themselves with the all-wise and
   living and essential Truth; for he, who says he possesses it, possesses
   it not. Thus many a man deceives himself and imagines he possesses all
   things, because he sees them in his own imagination, while they are
   hundreds of miles away; and thus he misses that noble treasure, deep
   humility; and accepts the counterfeit before him and also before other
   men.

   The fourth evil is the secret delight which is often taken in talent.
   This holds sway in many men; they are deceived by its good appearance,
   and pleasure attracts them more than divine love; they take pleasure
   for God, and that which they imagine God is only pleasure. Thus, if
   their pleasure were to vanish, so also would their diligence. Look well
   to yourselves; for many a thing which seems as though it came from
   divine love, has so many additions, that the enjoyment, the taste and
   the circumstances excite us more than we imagine. Sometimes this arises
   from new emotions, from inclination, or from fear of hell, or from the
   desire to be blessed; and this is man's natural desire. Know, children,
   that those who do not seek God from the heart, God will neither be
   their end nor their reward. All these things of which ye have heard
   must be diligently cut off, as with a sharp knife, which must be
   whetted on the severe judgments of God, and on His unchangeable
   righteousness, which lets nothing escape.

   Now, when these outward infirmities have been cut off, there still
   remains beneath the tendency to sin, the likeness of past habits; and
   this must be driven out by the Likeness of Jesus Christ. As one nail
   must be driven out by another, so must man imprint this Likeness
   devoutly and firmly on the ground of his heart, so that all
   inequalities in him may be done away and extinguished. Now, as God has
   given great power to minerals and herbs, to drive out disease, by what
   power do ye believe that the Son of God will drive out all the diseases
   of the soul, but by His holy Sufferings, His Death, and His sacred
   Likeness. Now, because man can do nothing by himself, he must exercise
   himself in holy suffering by means of prayer; he must cast himself down
   secretly at the feet of the heavenly Father, and beseech Him for the
   sake of His well-beloved Son, and by all His sufferings, to help him;
   for without Him he cannot attempt or succeed in anything. He must train
   himself never to allow the sacred Sufferings, nor the Likeness of his
   Lord to forsake his heart; and he must allow no strange likeness to
   find a place there. In order to do this, he must lift up his heart and
   mind to the heights of the glory of the Godhead, on which he must gaze
   with holy fear and longing desire. When he lays his dark and miserable
   ignorance before God, he will understand what Job said: "A Spirit went
   before me." [13] This leading of the Spirit causes a great disturbance
   in the heart of the man. The clearer, the truer, the plainer this
   leading is, the stronger, the quicker, the truer and the plainer will
   be the work, the strength and the conversion of the man; and he will
   more plainly recognise his place of abode. Then the Lord comes in a
   quick glance, and lights up the heart of the man, and will be Lord of
   all his work. When the man becomes conscious of the Lord's Presence, he
   must let his work alone and worship Him; all his powers must be still,
   and there must be calm. Otherwise the works of man would be but a
   hindrance, and his good works also; for he must do nothing but submit
   himself to God. But when man is again left to himself, and he is no
   longer conscious that God is working in him in any way that he can
   clearly recognize, then he must begin again to work diligently, and to
   discipline himself in holiness. Thus the man will sometimes work, and
   sometimes rest, as he is moved of God and entreated; everyone must do
   as seems best to him, either working or resting, so that he may be
   drawn to God. But he who cannot rest alone must make use of sacred
   pictures, and of discipline, so that he may be rooted and grounded in
   holy love, and may comprehend with all saints the height, the length,
   the depth and the breath.

   To understand all this is impossible; but it is possible to cling to it
   with love and pure intentions. The mind must lift itself up above all
   visible things, and above all the lower things of sense, and realise
   that God, Who can do all things, did not choose to make a creature so
   noble, that with the help of his natural understanding he could attain
   to the knowledge of the very essence of the Being of God. For the depth
   of the divine abyss cannot be fathomed by deep humility. Therefore our
   Lady, taking no heed of all the great blessings that God had poured out
   upon her, spake only of her lowliness, for which all generations should
   call her blessed, because God had regarded her only.

   The breadth of God must be understood as the universal love which He
   manifests in all places, in all lands, and in all the works and ways
   that are good. There is nothing so broad or so universal as God, nor so
   near to the inmost heart of man; he who will seek Him there, shall find
   Him. Thus every day we find Him in the Blessed Sacrament, in all the
   Friends of God, and in all creatures. This breadth must be sought with
   an earnest, fervent mind, that is, a mind that is empty and untroubled
   by all other things, and that has secretly yielded itself up with all
   its powers in the Presence of God. To that man will be given freedom of
   spirit and supernatural grace; he will be exalted in mind above all
   forms and fashions, and will soar above all created things. St Gregory
   speaks of it thus: "If we would come to the knowledge of invisible
   things, we must look beyond all things that are visible."

   The length is eternity, where there is no before and no after; but
   where all is still and unchanging, and in which all things exist, in a
   steady unchanging vision of Him, in whom all things exist. This length
   must be sought by man in a steady, unchanging and humble spirit;
   unchanging in God, and renouncing all love, all sorrow and all
   creatures, that he man be satisfied in God, may rest in peace, and may
   leave all things to God. Thus the noble word: Transite, will be
   accomplished; for man will overcome all things, and will be filled with
   the divine Birth of this lovely, noble Virgin, to whom all men should
   pay great honour. However highly they may be exalted, they should give
   time and trouble to honour and serve her. May we also follow her, that
   we may also come to that Birth by the help of God. Amen.

  SERMON IV

      On the Feast of St Stephen or of St Lawrence

   Of the three Grades of those who learn here to die to themselves in
   Nature and Spirit, that they may (like the Grain of Wheat) bring forth
   much fruit; viz. of those who are beginning, of those who are
   advancing, and of those who are perfect.

   Nisi granum frumenti cadens in terram mortuum fuerit, ipsum solum
   manet.

   "Unless the grain of wheat, falling into the ground, dieth, itself
   remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."

   By the Wheat we understand our Lord Jesus Christ, Who by His Death has
   brought forth much fruit for all men, if they are but willing, not only
   to reign with Him, but also, and in the first place, desire to follow
   Him in a dying life. For this may be called a dying life, when a man
   for the love of God refuses to gratify his senses and take his natural
   pleasure, and follow his own will; and as many lusts as he dies to, so
   many deaths does he offer to God, and so many fruits of life will he
   receive in return. For in what measure a man dies to himself, and grows
   out of himself, in the same measure does God, Who is our Life, enter
   into him.

   Now mark, dear children, that the path of a man thus dying may be
   divided into three stages. Those who have entered on the lowest stage
   do acts of self-denial from fear of hell and for the hope of heaven,
   with some love to God mingled therewith, which leads them to shun the
   most flagrant sins; but the love of God seldom works strongly in them,
   except it be stirred up by the contemplation of hell or heaven: for by
   reason of their blind self-love these men are terribly afraid of death,
   and are by no means eager to set their hand to the work of mortifying
   their undisciplined nature which shrinks therefrom; and they have
   little faith, which is the cause of this timorous weakness, that leads
   them to be ever fearing for their own safety; thus, just as formerly
   they sought and loved themselves in all kinds of carnal enjoyments and
   worldly vanities, and avoided bodily pain and inconvenience out of
   self-love, so now is the same motive at work, leading them to shun sin
   on account of punishment, in order to escape hell and obtain the
   rewards of heaven. And when they are still young in the love of God,
   they are apt to taste little sweetness in loving God, save when they
   hope to enjoy something from His love; as, for instance to escape hell
   and get to heaven; and if sometimes they meditate on the Sufferings of
   our Lord, and weep over them with strong emotion, it is because they
   think how He was willing to suffer so much for their sakes, and to
   redeem them by His bitter Death, still (because their love is small)
   they are much more inclined to dwell upon the bodily sufferings that He
   endured in His human nature, than to reflect how He manifested by His
   death the highest perfection of all virtue, as humility, love and
   patience, and therein so greatly glorified His Heavenly Father. For
   this sort of persons set out and begin to die while as yet they love
   themselves far too well; hence they are not yet able to see truly what
   it is to resign themselves to God, and to maintain a spirit of
   submission; and, although God does all things for the best, yet this
   they will never believe, and it is a perpetual stumbling-block to them.
   Thus they often ask and wonder why our Lord chose to suffer so much and
   why He leads his friends and followers to himself along such a path of
   suffering. And when they are at the beginning of a dying life, and only
   half-way inclined towards true perfection, nor perceive as yet wherein
   this consists, they oft-times torment themselves with watching and
   fasting and an austere way of life; for whatever is outwardly painful
   to the flesh they fancy to be greatly and mightily regarded and prized
   by God. So, when they eagerly take upon themselves all the hardships
   they can, then they think they have reached the summit of perfection,
   and judge all other men, nay, even those who are much more perfect then
   themselves, and think meanly of all who do not practice outward
   austerities, calling them low-minded and ignorant in spiritual things;
   and those who do not feel as they do they think to have gone astray
   altogether from a spiritual course and desire that all men should be as
   they are: and whatever methods of avoiding sin they have practised and
   still make use of by reason of their infirmity, they desire, nay,
   demand that everyone else should observe; and, if any do not do so,
   they judge them and murmur at them, and say that they pay no regard to
   religion.

   Now, while they thus keep themselves and all that belongs to them as it
   were working in their own service, and in this self-love unduly regard
   themselves as their own property, they cut themselves off from our
   Lord, and from the universal charity. For they ought to cherish
   continually a general love toward all men, both good and bad; but they
   remain absorbed in their partial and separate affections, whereby they
   bring upon themselves much disquiet, and remain a prey to their
   besetting sin of always seeking and studying themselves. And they are
   very niggardly of their spiritual blessings towards their fellow
   Christians; for they devote all their prayers and religious exercises
   to their own behalf; and, if they pray or do any other kind act for
   others, they think it a great thing, and fancy they have done them a
   great service thereby. In short, as they look little within, and are so
   little enlightened in the knowledge of themselves, so also they make
   little increase in the love of God and their neighbour; for they are so
   entangled with unregulated affections that they live alone in heart,
   not thoroughly commingling their soul with any in the right sort of
   thorough love. For the love of God, which ought to unite them to God
   and all mankind, is wanting in them; and, although they appear to keep
   the ordinances of God and of Holy Church, they do not keep the law of
   Love. What they do is more out of constraint and fear than from hearty
   love; and, because they are inwardly unfaithful to God, they dare not
   trust Him; for the imperfection which they find in themselves makes a
   flaw in their love to God. Hence their whole life is full of care, full
   of toil and ignoble misery; for they see eternal life on the one side,
   and fear to lose it, and they see hell on the other, and fear to fall
   into it; and all their prayers and religious exercises cannot chase
   away their fear of hell, so long as they do not die unto themselves.
   For the more they love themselves and take counsel for their own
   welfare, the more the fear of hell grows upon them; insomuch that, when
   God does not help them forward as much as they wish, they complain; and
   they weep and sigh at every little difficulty they encounter, however
   small, such as being tempted to vanity, wandering thoughts, and the
   like. They make long stories of what is of no consequence, and talk
   about their great difficulties and sufferings, as if they were
   grievously wronged; for they esteem their works, although small, to be
   highly meritorious, and that God Almighty owes them great honour and
   blessings in return. But our Lord will tell them (as He does in fact
   afterwards, when He has enlightened them with His grace) a poor fool
   loves his own wooden stick, or any other little worthless article, as
   much as a rich and wise man loves his sword, or any other great and
   precious thing.

   All such are standing on the lowest steps of a mortified life; and, if
   they do not die to themselves more, and come to experience more of what
   a mortified life is, it is to be feared that they will fall back from
   that little whereunto they have attained, and may plunge into depths of
   folly and wickedness, from which God keep us all! But before a man
   comes to such a fall, God gives him great spiritual delight; and upon
   this he is so greatly rejoiced that he cheerfully endures all sorts of
   austerities and penances; and then he weepeth that he hath arrived at
   perfection, and begins to judge his neighbours, and wants to shape all
   men after his own model, so greatly does he esteem himself in his own
   conceits.

   Then God comes in His mercy to teach him what he is, and shows him into
   what error he has fallen and permits the Enemy to set before him and
   make him taste the sweetness of sin; and then, when he has thus tasted,
   he conceives an inclination to one sin after another, and he cannot rid
   himself of these inclinations. Then he wishes to flee sin that he may
   escape hell, and begins to do outward good works; and yet it is a
   dreadful toil to perform these good works as a mere labour, and to put
   himself to pain; thus he is brought into an agonizing struggle with
   himself, and does not know which way to turn; for he dimly sees that he
   has gone astray. Then must God of His mercy come and raise him up, and
   he shall cry earnestly to God for help; and his chief meditation shall
   be on the Life and Works and especially the Sufferings of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   The second degree in which the grain of wheat dies is when a man is
   called upon to endure insult, contempt, and such-like deaths; and, so
   long as his grace lasts, he would fain continue to suffer; for by the
   sense of undeserved injury all his powers are but quickened and raised
   into a higher state of activity. But when he is bereft of this gracious
   sense of the Divine Presence, forasmuch as he is still far from
   perfection, he cannot bear up under this spiritual destitution, and,
   through his infirmity, falls a prey to mistrust of God, and fancies
   that God has forsaken him, and is not willing to help him towards
   perfection. Often he is in a hundred minds what to do or not do; and,
   if our Lord show him some kindness, then he feels as if all were well
   between his soul and God, and he feels himself so rich, as if he could
   never more be poor, and thinks to enjoy the Presence and Savour of God
   (though s yet he is quite untried); just as if the Almighty were his
   own personal, special Friend; and he is ready to believe that our Lord
   is, so to speak, at his disposal, will comfort him in adversity, and
   enrich him with all virtues. But, forasmuch as our gracious Lord sees
   that such a man will be very apt to rely upon his imagined powers, and
   thus to fall grievously, and sees also that the best and ripest fruit
   is being lost, inasmuch as the man has not yet attained to that
   perfection to which our Lord desires to lead him, therefore in due tine
   He withdraws from him all that He had revealed to him, because the man
   was too much occupied with himself, with thinking about his own
   perfection, wisdom, holiness and virtues; He thus brings him through
   poverty to dissatisfaction with himself, and a humble acknowledgement
   that he has neither wisdom nor worthiness; then does he begin to
   reflect within himself how justly Almighty God has stayed His hand from
   bestowing any sensible tokens of His mercy, because he fancied that he
   was something; now he sees clearly that he is nothing. He was wont to
   care for his good name and honour in the world, and to defend them as a
   man stands up for his wedded wife, and to count them who spoke evil of
   him as enemies to the common good. He was wont to desire and thirst
   after the reputation of holiness, like a meadow after the dew of
   heaven. He weaned that men's praises of him and proceeded altogether
   from real goodness and sympathy of heart, and by God's ordination, and
   had wandered so far from self-knowledge as not to see that he was in
   himself unsound from head to foot; he fancied that he was really as he
   stood in man's opinion, and knew nothing to the contrary.

   Here we must mark that he who wishes to heal himself of such-like
   grievous mistakes, and subdue such an unmortified nature, must take
   note of three points in himself. First, how much he has striven to
   endure cheerfully, for the sake of goodness, all the rebuke, slander
   and shame that has come upon him, patiently enduring it in his heart
   without outward complaint. Secondly, how much in the time of his
   rebuke, shame and distress he has praised and glorified God and his
   fellow-men, and shown kindness to his neighbour in all ways, in spite
   of all contradiction against himself. Thirdly, let him examine himself
   whether he have loved with cheerful and willing heart the men or
   creatures who have thus persecuted him, and sincerely prayed for them;
   and, if he finds that he has not done so, and is unwilling to do so,
   but is hard and bitter in his grief, then he may surely know, and ought
   to feel certain, that there is something false in him, and some resting
   in the praise of men and in his own spiritual pride, and that he is not
   dead. He has not yet come to the second step in a dying life.

   But our kind Lord, like a tender mother who is full of love, or a wise
   physician who desires to restore a sick man to perfect health by his
   powerful remedies, suffers him to fall many times that he may learn to
   know himself; and thus he falls into fleshly unspiritual temptations,
   such as he never experienced in those past days, in which he fancied
   himself very good and spiritual-minded. Our of mercy God deprives him
   of all understanding, and overclouds all the light in which he walked
   aforetime, and so hedges him in with thorns of an anguished conscience,
   that he thinks nothing else but that he is cast off from the light of
   God's countenance; and he moans greatly, and often with many tears
   exclaims: "O my God, why hast thou cast me off, and why go I thus
   mourning all the days of my pilgrimage?"

   And when he finds himself thus, from the crown of his head to the sole
   of his foot, unlike God and at variance with Him, he is filled with the
   sense of his own unworthiness, and with displeasure at himself,
   insomuch that he can hardly abide himself; and then he thinks many
   miserable things about himself from passages of Holy Scripture, and
   sheds many tears in the sense of his sinfulness, till he is weighed
   down to the earth with the pressure of God's hand, and exclaims with
   the prophet: "My sins are more in number than the sands of the sea;
   they have taken hold upon me that I am not able to look up; for I have
   stirred up God's anger against me, and done much evil in His sight."
   These things he saith, and more the like. And at times he is not even
   able thus to weep and lament, and then he is still more tormented with
   tribulation and assaults; for on the one hand he feels a strong desire
   to cast himself down humbly, and die to himself, and on the other he is
   conscious of great pride and arrogance about himself, till he is so
   exasperated at himself that, but for the dishonour to God, he would
   fain kill himself. I believe that all such conflict greatly wears out
   the intellectual and natural powers for it is so excessive, that one
   would rather suffer oneself to be put to death than endure it. Yet one
   grace is left him, namely, that he looks on it all as of no moment,
   whatever may be poured out over him, if only he may not knowingly
   offend God. After a while the grace of tears comes back to him, and he
   cried to God and says: "O Lord, rise, why sleepest thou?" and asks Him
   why He hath sealed up the fountains of His mercy; he calls upon the
   holy Angels and blessed spirits to have pity on him. He asks the
   heavens why they have become as brass, and the earth wherefore she is
   as iron, and beseeches the very stones to have compassion on his woes.
   He exclaims: "Am I become as the blasted hill of Gilboa, which was
   cursed of David that no rain or dew should fall on it? And how should
   my wickedness alone vanquish the invisible God, and force Him to shut
   up His mercies, Whose property it is to have mercy and to help?"

   In the second stage of the dying life God leads the soul through these
   exercises and operations of His hand, as through fire and water by
   turns, until the workings of self-sufficiency are driven out from all
   the secret corners of the spirit, and the man henceforward is so
   utterly ashamed of himself, and so casts himself off, that he can never
   more ascribe any greatness to himself, but thoroughly perceives all his
   own weakness, in which he now is and always has been; and whatever he
   does or desires to do, or whatever good thing may be said of him, he
   does not take it to his own credit, for he knows not how to say
   anything of himself but that he is full of all manner of infirmity.
   Then he has reached the end of this stage; and he who has arrived at
   this point is not far from the threshold of great mercies, by which he
   shall enter into the Bride-chamber of Christ. Then, when the day of his
   death shall come, he shall be brought in by the Bridegroom with great
   rejoicing.

   It is hard to die. We know that little trees do not strike their roots
   deep into the earth, and therefore they cannot stand long; so it is
   with all humble hearts, who do not take deep root in earth, but in
   heaven. But the great trees which have waxed high, and are intended to
   endure long upon the earth, these strike their roots deep, and spread
   them out wide into the soil. So it is with the men who in old times and
   now at this present have been great upon earth; they must needs through
   many a struggle and death die unto themselves, before all the
   self-sufficiency of their heart can be broken down, and they can be
   surely and firmly rooted for ever in humility. It does however happen
   sometimes that the Holy Spirit finds easier ways than those of which we
   have spoken, whereby He brings such souls to Himself.

   The third degree in which the grain of wheat dies belongs only to the
   perfect, who with unflagging diligence and ceaseless desire are ever
   striving to approach perfection. These men's state is one of mingled
   joy and sorrow, whereby they are tossed up and down; for the Holy
   Spirit is trying and sifting them, and preparing them for perfection
   with two kinds of grief and two kinds of joy and happiness which they
   have ever in their sight. The first grief is an inward pain and an
   overwhelming sorrow of heart, in the sense of the unspeakable wrong
   done to the Holy Trinity by all creatures, and specially by the bad
   Christians, who are living in mortal sin. The second grief consists in
   their fellow-feeling for and experience of all the grief and pain which
   the Human Nature of Christ has undergone.

   The first of the two joys lies in this dying; it is clear intuition and
   a perfect fruition to which they are raised in Christ by the power of
   the Holy Spirit, that they may enjoy the fruition of Him, and triumph
   in all the joys which they hope and believe after this life to behold
   in all their perfect fullness. The second triumph is that they are
   fulfilled in all the joys which the Human Nature of Christ possessed.
   This joy such a man hopes to share as a member of Christ; and, even if
   he cannot fathom the Abyss of God, he rejoices therein, for he sees
   that the overflowings of God's mercy are unspeakable, and feels that it
   is good for him that he is vanquished in the effort to comprehend God's
   power, and bends down beneath God in his self-dying.

   To this state a man cannot attain except he unite his will with God,
   with an entire renunciation and perfect denial of himself and all
   selfish love of himself; and all delight in having his own will be
   over-mastered and quenched by the shedding abroad in his heart of the
   Holy Spirit in the Love of God; so that it seems as if the Holy Spirit
   Himself were the man's will and love, and he were nothing and willed
   nothing on his own account. Yea, even the Kingdom of Heaven he shall
   desire for God's sake and God's glory, because Christ hath earned it in
   order to supply his needs, and chooseth to bestow it on him as one of
   His sons. When in this stage, a man loveth all things in their right
   order, God above all things--next the blessed (Human) Nature of Christ,
   and after that the blessed Mother of Christ, and the Saints of all
   degrees, each according to the rank which God hath enabled him to
   attain. When his affections are thus regulated, he sets himself in the
   lowest place at the wedding-feast of the Bridegroom. And when the
   Bridegroom comes Who has bidden him to the feast, He saith unto him:
   "Friend, go up higher." Then is is endowed with a new life, and
   illuminated with a new light, in the which he clearly perceives and
   sees that he alone is the cause of his own evil, that he cannot with
   truth throw the blame either on nature, the world, or the devil. Yea,
   he confesses that God has appointed him all these exercises and
   assaults out of His great love, in order that he may glorify God in
   overcoming these, and deserve a higher crown. Further, he perceives and
   sees that it is God alone Who has upheld him and stayed his steps, so
   that he has no longer an inclination to sin, and Who has removed the
   occasion to sin that he might not fall. Yea, what is still worse, he is
   forced to confess that he has often been dissatisfied that he was not
   able to derive more enjoyment from his sins. Thus all his being is
   swallowed up in sorrow and remorse for that he is still laden with his
   boundless infirmity.

   But he hath delight and joy in that he seeth that the goodness of God
   is as great as his necessities, so that his life may well be called a
   dying life, by reason of such his griefs and joys which are conformable
   and like unto the Life of our Lord Jesus Christ, which from beginning
   to end was always made up of mingled grief and joy. Grief, in that he
   left His heavenly throne and came down into this world; joy, in that He
   was not severed from the glory and honour of the Father. Grief, in that
   He was a Son of Man; joy, in that He nevertheless was and remained the
   Son of God. Grief, because He took upon Him the office of servant; joy,
   in that He was nevertheless a great Lord. Grief, because in human
   nature He was mortal, and died upon the Cross; joy, because He was
   immortal according to His Godhead. Grief, in His birth, in that He was
   once born of His Mother; joy, in that He is the only-begotten of God's
   Heart from everlasting to everlasting. Grief, because He became in time
   subject to time; joy, because He was eternal before all time, and shall
   be so for ever. Grief, in that the Word was born into the flesh, and
   hath dwelt in us; joy, in that the Word was in the beginning with God,
   and God Himself was the Word. Grief, in that it behooved Him to be
   baptized like any human sinner by St John the Baptist in the Jordan;
   joy, in that the voice of His Heavenly Father said of Him: "This is my
   beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased." Grief, in that like others,
   sinners, He was tempted of the Enemy; joy, in that the Angels came and
   ministered unto Him. Grief, in that He oftentimes endured hunger and
   thirst; joy, because He Himself the Lord of men and Angels. Grief, in
   that He was often wearied with His labours; joy, because He is the rest
   of all loving hearts and blessed spirits. Grief, forasmuch as His holy
   life and sufferings should remain in vain for so many human beings;
   joy, because He should thereby save His friends. Grief, in that He must
   needs ask to drink water of the heathen woman at the well; joy, in that
   He gave to that same woman to drink of living water, so that she should
   never thirst again. Grief, in that He was wont to sail in ships over
   the sea; joy, because He was wont to walk dry-shod over the waves.
   Grief, in that He wept with Martha and Mary over Lazarus; joy, in that
   He raised their brother Lazarus from the dead. Grief, in that He was
   nailed to the Cross with nails; joy, in that He promised Paradise to
   the thief by His side. Grief, in that He thirsted when hanging on the
   Cross; joy, in that He should thereby redeem His elect from eternal
   thirst. Grief, when He said: "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken
   Me?" joy, in that He would with these words comfort all sad hearts.
   Grief, in that His soul was parted from His body; and He died and was
   buried; joy, because on the third day He rose again from the dead with
   a glorified body.

   Thus was all His life, from the Manger to the Cross, a mingled web of
   grief and joy. Which life He hath left as a sacred testament to His
   followers in this present time, who are converted unto His dying life,
   that they may remember Him when they drink of His cup, and walk as He
   hath walked. May God help us so to do! Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SERMON V

      On St John the Evangelist's day

   How men must receive all that God gives, and ordains for those who
   truly seek him in all things, as from His Hand, and as for the best.
   How willingly God gives great gifts, when, in lowliness of mind, we
   esteem ourselves of small repute; and how all things are as nothing
   without God.

   Hic est discipulus ille, quem diligebat Jesus.

   "This is that disciple whom Jesus loved."

   Dear children, though God is no respecter of persons, and loves all the
   things that He has made, still He has His Friends (those who are most
   conscious of His favour, and turn to Him with all their might) who are
   especially dear to Him; and it is not His fault that all men do not
   turn to Him of their own free will. He is always ready to receive us;
   and He lets the sun of His grace shine on the good and on the evil.

   Now St John especially was conscious of the grace of God from his
   youth, and was always the dearly loved disciple of our Lord, on account
   of his virginal purity, his perfect love, his keen vision, and all his
   other virtues. If therefore we would be the dear disciples of God, we
   must first follow St John by dying wholly to ourselves, by resigning
   ourselves and all our affections to God; and by receiving all things
   from His hand; we must deny ourselves all pleasure in the love of
   created things apart from God. Those men who thus resign themselves,
   and submit entirely to God, seek earnestly all that God gives them; for
   it is, and it seems to them the best. Thou mayest (as truly as God
   lives) be certain that it must of necessity be the very best, and that
   no other way could be better than it is, though another might appear
   so; yet it would not be so good for thee, for God has chosen this and
   no other way; therefore it must needs be the best. It may be sickness,
   poverty, hunger or thirst; whatever it may be that God ordains or does
   not ordain, it is still the best for thee. It may be devotion or
   fervour, or that thou art to possess neither, as long as it is not
   caused by thine own neglect; only make up thy mind to seek God's honour
   in all things, in all that thou hast or hast not, then all that He
   sendeth thee will be for the best.

   Now thou mightest say perhaps: "How do I know whether it is the will of
   God or not?" Know this, that if it were not the will of God, it could
   not happen. Thou hast neither days of sickness, nor anything else,
   except it be the will of God. Now, if thou knowest it is God's will,
   thou oughtest to have so much pleasure and delight therein, that thou
   wouldest not heed pain as pain, even though it were extreme. It would
   be wrong for thee to be sensible of pain or suffering; for thou
   oughtest to accept it from God as the very best for thee. It is His
   very life, to desire only the best; therefore I ought to desire it, and
   nothing ought to please me better. Now, if there were a man whom I was
   most desirous to please, and I knew for certain that I should please
   him better in a gray garb than in any other, however good it might be,
   that gray garb would seem to be more desirable than any other though it
   were ever so good. Oh! take heed to yourselves, see how your love is
   fashioned! If ye truly loved God, nothing would delight you more than
   doing that which pleased Him best, and desiring that His will should be
   fully accomplished in us. However severe pain and discomfort may seem,
   if thou hast not as great delight in them as in comfort and pleasure,
   all is not well with thee.

   There is one thing which I am wont to say constantly, and which is also
   true, that we cry out every day and say in the Lord's Prayer: "Lord,
   Thy Will be done!" but then we feel angry, and are not so content with
   His will as that all He does should seem for the best. They who do
   accept it as the best, are kept in perfect peace in all things. Now,
   sometimes ye say: "Oh! if it had only been otherwise it would have been
   better," or, "if it had not happened thus it might have happened
   better." As long as thou art of this mind, thou wilt never attain to
   peace; thou must accept all as the very best.

   Now, mark, God is the Giver of all gifts, and all things that are best
   and highest are His real and most peculiar gifts. God gives nothing so
   willingly as great gifts, for it is natural to Him to give great
   things; therefore, the better things are, the more of them there are,
   the noblest creatures, the Angels, are especially wise; they have no
   bodily nature, and there are more of them in number than of all other
   created beings. Great things are really great gifts; and they are what
   I can best make my own and most desire.

   I speak also of that which may actually be expressed in word, and which
   must come out from within quite freely; it must not come from without
   into the heart; but that must come out from within, which really dwells
   in the inmost heart. There all things are present unto thee, and live
   and move and have their being, in Him, who is the Holy and Sovereign
   God. Why dost thou not find it thus? Because thou are not at home
   there. The nobler a thing is, the commoner it is. I have my natural
   sense in common with animals; and life in common with trees; and my
   being, which is still more to me, in common with all creatures. Heaven
   is more than all that is thereby; therefore it is also nobler. The
   nobler things are, the commoner they are. Love is noble, because it is
   universal. It seems hard to do that which our Lord has commanded, and
   to love our neighbours as ourselves. Common people say, "We ought to
   love them as we love God; for we love ourselves too well." But no, it
   should be otherwise. We must therefore love them very much, just as we
   love ourselves; and this is not hard; for, if ye would only see it,
   this command is more of a reward than a command. A command seems hard,
   but a reward is desirable. He, who loves God as he ought to love Him,
   yea, and as he must love Him, whether he will or no, and as all
   creatures love Him, must love his neighbour as himself. He must joy in
   his joys, as though they were his own; he must be as desirous for his
   honour as though it were his own; and he must treat a stranger as
   though he were dear unto him. Then that man will be always rejoicing,
   always useful, and always honourable. It will seem like heaven to him;
   and he will have far more joy, that if he rejoiced only in his own
   good.

   Now, know of a truth, that if thine own honour is of more importance to
   thee, and dearer than that of another man, thou doest wrongfully. Know
   this, that if thou seekest something that is thine own, thou seekest
   not God only; and thou wilt never find Him. Thou art acting as though
   thou madest a candle of God to seek for something; and, when thou hast
   found it, thou castest the candle away. Therefore, when thou doest
   this, that which thou seekest with God, whatever it may be, it is
   nothing; gain, reward, fervour, or whatever it may be, thou seekest
   nothing, therefore wilt thou find nothing. There is no other cause for
   finding nothing, but that thou seekest nothing. All creatures are
   absolutely nothing. That which has no being is nothing. And creatures
   have no being, because they have their being in God; if God turned away
   for a moment, they would cease to exist. He who desired to have all the
   world with God, would have nothing more than if he had God alone. All
   creatures have, without God, nothing more than a man has, who has a
   mite, or absolutely nothing, without Him; neither more nor less.

   Listen, I beseech you, to a true saying. A man might give a thousand
   marks to build churches and monasteries, and it would be a great gift;
   but he who careth nought for a thousand marks has done more and given
   more. When God created all creatures, they were so vile and mean that
   He could not live and move in them. Then He made the soul of man, like
   unto and in harmony with Himself, that unto him He might give Himself;
   for all else that He gave him, man heeded not. God must give Himself to
   me as my own, as He is in Himself, or I have nothing and care for
   nothing. He, who would receive God in full measure, must give himself
   wholly to God; he must go our of himself. He will receive the like from
   God, all that He has as his own, as God Himself has it, and as He has
   given it to our Lady and to all that are in heaven. Those who have thus
   gone forth, and have given themselves, shall also, all alike, receive
   all in all and nothing less.

   Now know, that of ourselves, we have nothing; for this and all other
   gifts are from above. Therefore he who would receive from above, must
   of necessity place himself beneath, in true humility. And know of a
   truth, that if he leave anything out, so that all is not beneath, he
   will have nothing and receive nothing. Dost thou trust to thyself, or
   to anything else, or anybody else? thou art not beneath, and wilt
   receive nothing; but if thou hast placed thyself beneath, then Thou
   wilt receive all things fully. It is God's nature to give; and He lives
   and moves that He may give unto us when we are humble. If we are not
   lowly, and yet desire to receive, we do Him violence, and kill Him, so
   to speak; and, though we may not wish to do this, yet we do it, as far
   as in us lies. That thou mayest truly give Him all things, see to it,
   that thou castest thyself in deep humility at the Feet of God, and
   beneath all created beings; that thou exaltest God in thy heart, and
   that thou confessest Him. The Lord our God sent His only-begotten Son
   into the world. God sent His Son in the fulness of time, for the sake
   of our souls, and that we might be filled with Him. When a soul is
   freed from place and time, the Father sends His Son into that soul to
   be born there. Nothing can hinder God in us, or us in God, if in our
   hearts we neither hang on to, nor cleave to time and place, nor exalt
   ourselves above time and place in Eternity, which is God Himself. Amen.

  SERMON VI

      Of the Feast of the Holy Virgin St Agnes

   How outward purity of body, and inner chastity of mind, may be attained
   and preserved. Especially, how purity of mind may be preserved, in
   spite of the outward attacks of human love and imaginations; and that
   no man, however spiritually minded he may be, can ever be sure, while
   he is still here in the body, that his frail nature has been completely
   killed, so that he can never be tempted to impurity. Of three snares
   that are laid for those who are spiritually minded, into which they may
   fall and against which they must guard themselves, be they never so
   perfect.

   Virgo cogitat, quae Domini sunt, ut sit sancta et corpore et spiritu.

   "A virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both
   in body and spirit."

   A virgin, says St Paul, thinks and meditates on the things of the Lord,
   that she may be holy in body and soul. Four things are needful for
   virgins, that they may be pure in body and pure in spirit. To purity of
   body pertain spotlessness of the flesh, and moderation in the use of
   all bodily necessaries, in eating or drinking, sleeping or waking. A
   virgin must refrain from talking; she must be modest in all her ways;
   she must abstain from mixing in dissolute society or amusements, and be
   lowly and simple in her daily life; industrious in good and seemly
   work, or in works of penance and such-like; for all these things tend
   to external chastity. He who seeks to perfect or preserve his chastity
   in any other way, will find he has been deceived; for that which is
   visible must be visibly overcome; or else the impurity of the flesh
   will overcome the purity of the spirit. It is plain that he who tries
   to tame the flesh by the flesh will not effect much. And now we will
   say no more of this, but say a little about the chastity of the spirit,
   how it may be lost or preserved; and this is a useful subject, which
   all those who are spiritually minded will do well to consider and
   remember.

   Purity of spirit consists in a clean, pure and humble conscience; for a
   humble conscience is a pure mind and a clean heart. A pure mind is to
   be gained by exercise in the Holy Scriptures. From thence come holy
   meditations which fill the heart of man; and therefore it is the sooner
   freed from all vain and wicked thoughts. Be sure, nothing doubting,
   that the man, who devotes himself to diligent study of the Holy
   Scriptures, will be preserved and guarded from the grosser temptations
   to impurity. This is shown by St Jerome, when he says: "Love to search
   the Scriptures, and then ye will not care for the lusts of the flesh,
   nor delight in them." But a clean heart must be gained by driving out
   all desire for the creature, and especially for man; for a good and
   holy man is so easily grieved and disturbed in his heart by the
   inordinate love of man, that it often takes him a long time to drive
   out that love from his heart, which had entered in a moment. Therefore,
   unless man shuns the causes which minister to the flesh, he can get no
   further, and he must receive a hurt that will grieve him. It is here
   that man is most easily wounded, on account of his natural
   short-sightedness, which is so deeply rooted in inordinate desire, that
   he will be kept occupied all the days of his life; though many a man,
   who does not realize it, is as bold and joyful as though he had
   conquered in every strife and had overcome.

   Now, dear children, though ye had conquered in a thousand fights, and
   had gained the victory, ye must not trust to it; for as long as body
   and soul are joined together, to none is freedom assured on earth. That
   which may not happen in a hundred years, often comes in one moment; so
   that many a good and pure man has been tempted and led astray in such a
   manner that he hardly knew how it came about. Not that such men are
   spotted by outward deeds, or fall into open carnal sins, though
   sometimes even this occurs; but then they are molested by the charm of
   evil desire, dangerous, transitory and carnal love, which darkens their
   understanding and judgment, and the fervour which they had before
   experienced; and they are cast into a hell of distress and scorn, and
   feel the gnawings of conscience. Thus man seems to be going to the
   gates of hell and of external darkness, just like one who is about to
   be killed, and, who in great fear and horror of death, loses his senses
   and reason. This comes from lack of watchfulness; but it is at times
   also ordained by God, that the man may ground himself in true humility,
   and may learn to know his own infirmity, and may be able to feel for
   other men in theirs. This is especially the case with those who afflict
   themselves, in order to overcome and to kill the inner, reasoning and
   upright man, because they long to attain to absolute poverty of spirit.
   It is necessary that they, more than all men, should guard themselves
   in the presence of those who are unlike them. For the Tempter, who
   never rests, does not forget his cunning when he finds a good
   opportunity. Now if such men strive diligently to destroy the inner man
   absolutely, and to walk in all singleness of heart, they will exert
   themselves to overcome all inner troubles, so that they may
   uncomplainingly and unresistingly submit themselves to God in all
   things, whenever and however it may please Him. They must not endeavour
   to get their own way in His work, but must desire that His will may be
   done, without any choosing on their part. See, by this means, man will
   attain to such simplicity of heart, and such peace, both outwardly and
   inwardly, and also in his nature, that he will be scarcely conscious of
   any resistance in himself. Neither is he conscious of any shame, nor
   yet of the burden of a guilty conscience; and, to use a simile, it
   seems as though he had returned to his original ignorance and
   innocence, and were like a young child who follows the dictates of
   nature without shame. In the same way a child might thus naturally go
   his own way, and grow up, according to nature, taking no care or pains
   to tame his unruly passions. Thus it would come to pass that his
   passions would grow stronger and stronger; and, as understanding and
   desire increased, sin also would increase. This might also happen to a
   pure and spiritually-minded man, however child-like his innocence might
   be, who had long lived a life of seclusion, and who seemed to have so
   conquered his outer and lower nature that he was scarcely conscious at
   any time of temptation, either sleeping or waking; and who, were the
   occasion to arise, or where he incited to it, would take no pleasure in
   it, but would imagine he could easily withstand all these attacks and
   temptations. Yea, it would even seem to him as though for him in such
   things, than there would be for a man who was dead; in seeing, hearing,
   speaking, or in anything else possible. Now see, nature seems quite
   dead; and yet none should put their trust in it, either men or women,
   however sure of themselves they may be, and even satisfied as to their
   condition. Now, however perfect and holy the man in truth may be,
   however dead he may seem to all these things, if he will not flee from
   temptations, his heart will of necessity be wounded by sensual desires;
   and it will be agitated and tempted by the love of a friend, more for
   one than for another.

   Now mark, dear children, how this takes place, and how by degrees man
   falls into such snares. First of all, love is felt for people on
   account of their grace, their piety and their spirituality; and this is
   all-sufficing to the heart, and seems to be all spiritual, and is
   accepted with great thankfulness to God and to these men. If man does
   not continue to strive to chase away these emotions, the longing creeps
   in to show these people outwardly a little kindness out of pure
   friendliness. He recognises them by pleasant words and gestures, by
   laughing and bowing, by touching their clothes, or taking them by the
   hand, or embracing them, or by bowing the head to them, and by many
   such like things. These are all signs of natural human love, and show
   that the heart has been wounded by unregulated love. It may be, if the
   man does not shun it, that he will be still more deeply wounded; and it
   may go so far, that spiritual pleasure is turned into carnal pleasure;
   and the man, thus entangled in this net of the devil's and of carnal
   desires, cannot easily escape from it without great injury and danger
   of sin in his heart. Yea, it may even go so far that he dallies with
   such pleasure till at last he consents to it; and that would be a sin
   unto death; and, if even then he did not become conscious of it, he
   might fall into great spiritual sin without any opposition on his part.

   See, dear children, a good man may thus fall into all kinds of sin, if
   he does not at once resist the temptation. Yea, and even though he had
   attained to the highest and most perfect state of virtue, if he does
   not flee from these sins, he may stand in great danger from them,
   greater danger than he was ever in before. Never was it more necessary
   for him to shun them than it would be now; for no one is free from
   these temptations and incitements, as long as his breath is in his
   body; and, however holy he may be, it is possible for him to fall into
   sin and to endanger his salvation, unless he keeps watch over himself.

   As all teachers point out to us, three snares are laid for the
   spiritually-minded, into which they may fall. The first is a man's
   holiness. The second is when people are of one family, and belong to
   each other by birth and nature, or are related, that as being brothers
   and sisters, and so forth. The third snare is personal holiness, and
   that in the long practice of virtue, so that the occasion of sin is not
   shunned. This carnal affection sometimes exists between persons of
   different sex, between a man and a woman. They fall in love with each
   other, and seek distraction and diversion together, asking each other
   how they are, and about their station and place in life. Ye will see
   that this must in the end bring trouble and come to a bad end, and
   cause sorrow and heaviness of heart. This is especially the case when
   people of unequal rank start such a friendship together. This cannot be
   tolerated by anyone with a good conscience; for thence arise contempt,
   suspicion, irritation and the destruction of inner spiritual peace.
   Therefore all those who are obliged by necessity, or their office, to
   speak to people who are not of the same rank as themselves, must do so
   as little as possible, and go away as soon as possible; and this will
   be good for their own consciences, and also for their inferiors or
   equals, who will be the less angered or tempted thereby. Whoever,
   therefore, wishes to be preserved in such a case, or from other sins,
   must, as Bonaventura says, seat himself and speak openly, as though he
   wished everyone to see how he treats such persons, and that he no more
   desires to carry on improper relations with them than with anyone else.
   Neither must he set his heart on any other person, to such a degree
   that he is absorbed in that person. He must never be outwardly too
   friendly to anyone, especially to people of different sex, either in
   kindly or spiritual intercourse; but he must behave gravely towards
   them, and hurry straight away, exchanging only short words with them.

   Now ye see, dear children, that if even a good and pious man can thus
   fall into unchastity from such causes as I have mentioned, how it will
   be with those who, either in thought, or will, or deed, do not tear
   themselves away from all such temptations, and who are not ready to die
   to all superfluity, pleasure, effeminacy, fastidiousness and unruly
   mirth, and to all the other causes of sin that are evident. Oh! if even
   a good man is thus tempted to impurity, how will it be with a man who
   is dilatory, wilful, fastidious, lazy and idle, dull and dead to all
   spiritual things? Will he not revel in them and be corrupted? This is
   known alone to the Lord God, Who trieth the reins and the hearts. But
   may God have mercy upon us, poor sinners, and preserve us from those
   troublesome snares of unchasity; that we may be found pure and clean in
   His sight, in body and soul; pure in conscience; from from all vain
   thoughts and from all evil desires; resting not in the creature, but in
   God only, and loving Him alone and above all things. May God help us
   thereto. Amen.

  SERMON VII

      Our Lady's Candle-Mass

   How we may offer ourselves, night and day, unto God in holy discipline;
   in prayer, in meditation, in beholding God, and by thanking God and
   praising Him; thereby following the example of the blessed Mother of
   God.

   Ecce ego mitto angelum meum ante faciem meam.

   "Behold I send My Angel, and he shall prepare the way before My Face.
   And presently the Lord, Whom ye seek, and the Angel of the Testament,
   Whom ye desire, shall come to His temple."

   To-day we would commemorate the fact, that the Lord, to Whom all time
   belongs, and by Whom the Law was made, subjected Himself to time and
   law, and offered Himself for us in the temple of His heavenly Father.
   It was not necessary that He, like any other firstborn son, should be
   sanctified; for all holy seasons and festivals, places and temples, are
   made holy by Him. Neither was it necessary for His blessed Mother to be
   purified, like other women, for she was shielded from all sin, and
   conceived and bare the Son of God by the operation of the Holy Ghost,
   remaining ever a virgin and adorned with all purity. Her purity was
   much greater than that of all Angels; for it is impossible to imagine
   greater purity apart from God. And yet she also subjected herself to
   the austere law, and offered her dear Child to the heavenly Father at
   the hands of the priest, and herself, not her Son, as a living
   sacrifice and to the praise of God, for the salvation of all men.

   Now, by this we are taught that we must, at all times, repress
   ourselves and become absorbed in deep humility, as those who have
   nothing and can do nothing of themselves, but that which is evil; and
   that in the inner temples of our souls we must offer up ourselves, our
   own wills, and all that we have and are, in complete resignation to God
   at all times, with the Son in the Father, as an eternal sacrifice of
   praise. All that the Father has He gives to His Son; so dear is the
   Son, that the Father loves nothing but the Son; and those whom He finds
   united with the Son, He loves in the Son. Therefore, we must exert all
   the powers of our souls, and offer them to the Father in the Son, that
   they may be loved by Him in the Son, after the perfect pattern of Mary,
   the most holy Virgin and Mother of God. Now, to-day, I will tell you
   something about her, how we may copy her holy life; because she was
   full of grace and virtue, and the mirror and exact reflection of all
   holiness.

   This gentle Virgin spent the whole of her life in such perfect love to
   God, in the inner temple of her heart, that she never loved any other
   creature beside God. Neither did any image ever come into her mind that
   interposed between her and her love of God. Her love to God was
   undivided, and she loved all creatures in Him. With all her powers she
   communed with herself in the depths of her heart, wherein the Divine
   Image lay hidden; there she dwelt in the innermost temple of her soul,
   and turned all her powers within, and prayed there to the one God in
   spirit and in truth. She confessed that she could not worthily praise
   God; therefore she desired that He would praise and magnify Himself in
   her. She was so conformed to God from the very bottom of her heart,
   that if any one could have looked into it, he would have seen God in
   all His glory, and would have actually seen the procession of the Son
   and of the Holy Ghost; for her heart never turned away from God.

   Now, shall I tell you something about the devotional exercises of this
   Holy Virgin? They are, however, so divine and superhuman, so high and
   unfathomable, that they surpass the understanding of men and of Angels.
   But of her lesser devotions ye shall know that she always got up at
   midnight, and lifted up her heart to the heavenly Father, in such rapt
   devotion, that it forced its way through heaven, and rested only in the
   Father's Heart; and thus she stood absorbed in prayer till break of
   day. Oh! how blessed is he with whom she shares her gentle prayers, and
   for whom, with especially motherly love, she intercedes with her Son.

   Now, learn, that she knew that she was beloved and endowed above all
   other creatures by God; therefore, when she got up at midnight, she
   fell on her knees in lowliness, and thanked God for His rich bounty,
   which He had poured out upon her. Then she offered herself and all that
   she had to God in prayer, and gave herself into God's gentle keeping,
   that He might begin and accomplish His will in her, and in all that was
   hers. Thirdly, she prayed for all the members of the Holy Church, that
   all things might be ordered therein for the best in all godly honour;
   and for all sinners, that they might truly turn again unto salvation.
   And then she turned in her prayer to all the poor souls in purgatory,
   for whom she had especial love, and besought God to set them free.
   Fourthly, she talked with God as a child might talk with his father, or
   one dearly loved to her beloved; and then often, by the eye of faith
   she beheld the Divine Being, unveiled, in all His glory and beauty, and
   God spake with her as with His dear and chosen spouse. Fifthly, she
   began to praise God in her prayer with such lively praise, that it
   seemed to come forth from a divine and blossoming garden that had been
   tended by God. Her praise was sweeter and purer, and more pleasing to
   God, than when He had created heaven and earth, the morning stars and
   the children of God praised Him. Sixthly, she sank down in her prayer
   into her own nothingness, and confessed that she could not worship the
   great God, nor praise Him according to His worthiness; and she desired
   of Him that He would be magnified in her; and then she let all her
   powers sink down to the lowest depths, whence alone the Eternal God
   receives the prayer and praise that He loves best.

   Know also that, when she thus prayed, she withdrew her mind from all
   that was external, from all forms and figures, and continued thus, her
   whole mind being absorbed. Afterwards she meditated on the greatness
   and glory of the Lord, with Whom she desired to hold converse, though
   in her own sight she was a worthless creature. Then she fell down at
   the Feet of the glorious God, and prayed in deep humility, and in
   earnest, fervent love and desire, and with heartfelt trust in the
   boundless love of God, that He would hear her, not according to her own
   will, but according to His. And she continued in prayer from midnight
   till dawn, and from that time till Prime she devoted herself to holy
   meditations, in the best way that any creature ever did. First of all
   she meditated on the greatness and almightiness of the great God, whom
   she confessed as above all Angels. Then she sank down in her own
   littleness, in deep humility. Secondly, she meditated on the mysterious
   and unfathomable judgments of God, and on His wisdom, which is hidden
   from all creatures. Thirdly, on the fathomless goodness of God in His
   eternal love, which is the loving source of all that is good and
   gracious. Fourthly, she meditated on the overflowing sweetness of God,
   from whom she had received so much sweetness; for, had she not been
   overshadowed by the Holy Ghost, her divine heart must have burst with
   love. Fifthly, she meditated with tearful eyes on the humility of her
   Child, Who had humbled Himself, and had so trodden the path of
   humiliation that it was impossible for Him to humble Himself any more.

   Sixthly, she meditated on the sufferings of her Child, how great and
   manifold they were; and this she did with great compassion, for the
   meditation smote like a sword through her virgin heart and soul.
   Therefore hers was a martyr's reward, as much as that of any other
   martyr. Then she meditated on the sufferings of her Child, desiring to
   imitate Him; for she bethought herself how, at all times, her Child had
   been despised and had suffered; therefore she devoted all her life to
   suffering and to bearing oppression. She so entirely submitted herself,
   that she never prayed to God that her suffering might be shortened or
   lessened. She spent her life in suffering, and bore it to the end with
   willing submission, willing even to suffer throughout eternity, if such
   were the will of God. Then she meditated again on the sufferings of her
   Child; how He had borne His suffering with great patience, without
   murmuring, rejoicing in spirit, because of His burning love and desire
   for us. Thus she also bore her suffering without murmuring and with
   burning love and joy.

   At the hour of Prime she went into the Temple, and betook herself to a
   corner with downcast eyes, and stayed there till mid-day. Mentally
   reaching out into eternity, she meditated on the commands and
   discourses of the Lord; then her soul was exalted, as in a divine
   vision, above all knowledge, and she was transfigured in spirit above
   all powers. Her memory shed a pure light, and remained in the unity of
   the spirit above all carnal suggestions. Her mind was transfused with
   clearness, so that she understood and discerned all the virtues, the
   ways, the discipline and the mysteries of Scripture with judgment. Her
   will was set alight with fervent heat, in silent love, passing beyond
   all created things. In this state of exaltation she was above all
   wisdom and all judgment. Here she received the outpouring of Divine
   Love, in silence, her spirit was steeped in the immaterial Spring,
   without any exercise of her own power. Here, above all things, she
   reposed in God, and, surrounded by Love unfathomable, she lost herself
   in the obscurity of the Godhead. She was united, without any
   intervention, and made one Spirit with God, above all created gifts,
   graces and lights, in one single light that renewed itself unceasingly
   in the depths of her heart, in the highest exaltation of spirit. In
   this she had some conception of future blessedness, and she loved God
   with eternal, uncreated love. All created gifts, virtues, works and
   discipline, with all that pertained to the creature, must here remain
   without, for she was moulded herein with divine brightness above all
   sense and imagination. She saw the eternal lights and scenes, as they
   were beholden in eternity, with unspeakable and divine joy and
   pleasure. Know that, were all the delights and joys of the world melted
   down altogether, they would be nothing but bitterness, compared with
   the least divine joy such as that ever received by the Mother of God.

   Now, know, that the Blessed Virgin possessed one grace above all other
   human beings; to whatever heights she might be caught up and entranced,
   beholding God in the light of God, she saw, none the less, all other
   things, and attended to them. Thus she could even order her outer life
   in calm and holy conduct, without disturbing her inner life; for her
   highest powers communed directly with their Source, and were united
   thereto, so that the lowest were obedient to the highest, as those of
   Adam had been in Paradise. This grace was hers, because she never
   inherited original sin; for she had been preserved from this by her
   Child; so that never for an instant had she been the child of wrath, or
   an unclean vessel, under the power of the Devil, like the rest of
   mankind. The Eternal Wisdom prevented and would not allow this chosen
   Temple to be thus defiled. Therefore, during this inner vision and
   absorption in God, she could listen with her outward ears, with
   diligence and devotion and deep humility of heart, to Divine Service;
   it gave her no trouble, but was delightful and desirable above all
   things to her at this time. Then, when towards mid-day she went home,
   she was often fed by the Angels.

   In the afternoon, if it was not a Holy day, she worked, till Vespers,
   with her blessed hands, and did everything, however small it might be,
   with especial intention to the glory of God. But, if it was a Holy day,
   after she had praised God, she went to hear the Word of God, and
   listened to it with great humility, however plainly it might be spoken,
   and though she understood it better herself; and she stamped it
   earnestly in her pure heart, earnestly desiring to experience the least
   as well as the greatest. When the Word of God was not preached, she
   spoke or listened to others, speaking of God and of the Divine Life; or
   she read the Scriptures till Vespers. Then she sang her Psalms and said
   her prayers till Compline.

   Then, when night came on, she communed with herself in holy meditation,
   and meditated on the perfect Life of her Child and her Lord, and on
   this sweet doctrine; and her heart was filled with joyful and eternal
   sweetness. Afterwards she would thank God on her knees that He had so
   graciously looked upon her on that and every day; and then, in meekness
   and thankfulness, the blessed Virgin Mary laid herself to rest. Hosts
   of Angels surrounded her holy bed, so that no evil spirits might
   torment her; therefore she had no vain fancies or evil dreams, nor any
   other vision that that which God Himself gave to her; for the Holy
   Trinity was ever her defense and shield. The blessed Virgin never lay
   down without first dedicating her sleep with her whole heart to the
   glory of God; and, thus united with God, she bowed her blessed head on
   the Heavenly Father's Breast, and rested in peace. At midnight she
   began to pass the day again, as she had passed it before, in all
   holiness and virtue.

   This is related of a portion of her holy life, as in a mirror, that we
   may place it before us as our example, and, following it, may also
   remain faithful to God, and offer up ourselves wholly in the inner
   temples of our souls, according to our power. But that we may be able
   to do this, we must call on God unceasingly for His divine grace and
   help, and also on His dear Mother, to whom we should, at least once
   every day, give especial honour and service. She will then, on her
   part, help us faithfully in our need, and especially in our last trial;
   for she is a mother of mercy and cannot reject any sinner who desires
   her help. Therefore St Bernard says: "He alone can keep silence about
   thy mercy, O blessed Virgin, who has called upon thee in his distress
   and has been forsaken by thee. For we, thy unworthy servants, rejoice
   with thee in thy other virtues, but in this virtue we rejoice for
   ourselves. We praise thy virginity, we marvel at thy lowliness, but we
   embrace thy mercy more willingly; the oftener we think of it, the
   oftener we appeal to it. Thou upholdest us, and forsakest not the
   miserable sinner, until thou seest that the terrible Judge is
   propitiated." May we thus honour and follow this blessed Virgin and her
   Child, that we may attain to a portion with them in eternity. May God
   help us thereto. Amen.

  SERMON VIII

    On the Feast of St Agatha, or the Holy Virgins

   That which is needful for a true virgin, that she may be pleasing unto
   God, for Whose sake she has despised the kingdom of the world; that
   which may be sung of every holy virgin.

   Regnum mundi, et omnem ornatum saecus contempsi, propter

   amorem Domini mei, Jesu Christi.

   "The kingdom of this world and all secular adornments have I held in
   contempt, for the love of my Master Jesus Christ."

   These words are sung by the Holy Church in the person of every
   spiritual spouse of Christ, who has given herself to Him that she may
   be ever faithful in doing His will and service. Now mark, dear
   children, what qualifications such a bride and virgin of God must
   possess, who desires to be pleasing and acceptable unto God; so that,
   at last, He may espouse her unto Himself for ever; when her soul will
   be so completely united with Him, that she will never again be parted
   from Him throughout eternity, nor He from her.

   The first qualification is, that a virgin cannot please God, unless she
   despises the kingdom of this world and all its pomp. She must
   diligently guard against pride, vain-glory, the desire to please people
   outwardly, either in her person with the adornment of clothes, or with
   any fleeting things. She must leave all these for God's sake; and not
   only the things pertaining to the body, but also to the mind; the
   spiritual world and all its adornments, which consist of pride,
   vain-glory, a good outward appearance, and spiritual words out of a
   worldly heart; in excessive joys of the heart in spiritual gifts or
   virtues, or satisfaction in personal goodness. These things happen to
   and befall the virgins of Christ in so many ways, that it is not easy
   to say how the Enemy dares to deceive these pure hearts.

   The second qualification is, that she must guard herself diligently
   against worldly customs and conduct, and against all harmful habits,
   both outwardly and inwardly. She must not be proud in heart of haughty
   in bearing before other people; she must not boast nor hold herself in
   high esteem because she is wise or prudent, nor try to defend herself
   when she is despised or oppressed; but with modest and soft words and
   demeanour, and in all lowliness, she must set herself to acknowledge
   and cure her faults.

   The third qualification is, that it is not enough for her to know that
   she must suffer; she must also resign herself completely in all that
   vexes her and brings her trouble. She must help to work in God's
   vineyard with patience, in the pure ground of a humble heart, in which
   God only dwells; for God only dwells in the heart of a virgin who
   abases herself, from the ground of her heart, in humility, beneath God
   and all men, and, if it must be, even unto death. By this complete
   self-annihilation a human being may win from and obtain from God all
   that he needs; and more still; for God comes to meet such with all His
   grace, and exalts them with all the honour with which He has honoured
   His Saints.

   The fourth qualification. It is necessary for a good virgin, in this
   life, to be chastened, despised, rejected, ill-used and rebuked, even
   as the Canaanitish woman was treated by Christ. And thus He treats,
   even now, all His chosen ones, who are especially dear to Him, and on
   whom He will lavish His especial grace. Inwardly He will chastise them
   severely, and treat them hardly; and outwardly also He ordains that
   they shall be trodden under foot by everyone; men shall speak evil of
   them; and they shall be despised in their own eyes with wanton
   falsehood. Then will the virgin of Christ despise herself utterly, and
   suppress herself in true humility, and rejoice in it for the sake of
   God, and think of herself as unworthy of all this suffering, thanking
   God that He has thus especially endowed her as His own.

   The fifth qualification. It also appertains to such a virgin, that she
   would not only be despised here of men, but that she should also
   despise herself, and suffer patiently all that happens to her,
   concealing it in her heart and complaining to no one. We often see
   virgins ready in words to despise themselves before men, saying: "We
   are all sinners," who would nevertheless take it very ill, if anyone
   else said it of them; and thus we discover that it is all pride. A
   virgin who is not humble at heart may be known, when anything happens
   to her untowardly, though it were only a word; for she is indignant at
   once, she is offended with what is said to her, and begins to excuse
   herself immediately. She cannot bear anyone to say anything that is
   insulting to her honour, or that would cause her to be despised; and
   yet she wishes to be considered humble. No, dear child, all the
   contempt and scorn that a man is ready to pour out upon himself has no
   real ground in humility; but, when he is despised and scorned by
   another who is his equal, or still more, by one who is his inferior, he
   is cut to the quick; and then a man will learn to know how little
   humble and patient he really is.

   The sixth qualification. A good virgin never wastes her time by any
   neglect or carelessness; but, her heart filled with longing and
   devotion, she meditates on the Sufferings of her beloved Lord Jesus,
   and His Five Wounds; she knows of nothing better that she can do; for
   nothing can be more useful to her than to spend her time in meditation
   on the Life and Sufferings of our Lord, for Whom she has forsaken all
   things. It is the nature of all good virgins to spend the whole of
   their lives in work, both outwardly and inwardly, for the glory of God;
   to pray for the salvation of all men; and to offer themselves up for
   the infirmities of the common people, both the evil and the good. If
   the virgin of Christ be left to herself, all love and devotion to God
   being withdrawn from her; if thus, bare, poor and miserable, she still
   serves God; then God is honoured by her, and has peculiar delight in
   her.

   The seventh qualification. She must look to God, and think only of Him
   in all her occupations; and she must be indifferent to all outward
   things; and she must do what is right, as though she did nothing, while
   she looks upon all real afflictions as though they did not concern her.
   Such an handmaid of the Lord desires to suffer shame and scorn from all
   men, to the glory of God, and desires neither power nor honour. She
   cannot exempt herself from anything, for the Holy Ghost directs her. At
   times such people are obliged to take precedence of others; but then
   they do it with great courtesy and great humility, and carry out that
   which Christ said: "Let him that is the greater among you become as he
   that serveth."

   The eighth qualification. This virgin of Christ must fight against all
   earthly transitory things, honour and desires. As soon as these desires
   begin to lose their strength in her heart, she will be attacked by
   spiritual pride; that is by self-satisfaction, and the desire for
   temporal honour, which can really be driven out by none other but by
   God. For, however holy a man may be, he will have to fight to the end,
   and chiefly against spiritual pride. Although in these truly humble
   virgins neither pride nor covetousness, nor hatred can find a
   resting-place, yet they are nevertheless much tempted at times by
   idleness, appetite and unholy thoughts, which arise from their nature,
   and are the temptations of the flesh, which have not as yet been
   overcome; and this temptation is very useful to them. For, because
   these lovers of God care for nothing but suffering, shame, and all that
   is painful, both outwardly and inwardly, for the sake of the love of
   Christ, and seek only visions of God and inner delight, finding therein
   more joy and satisfaction than in all the eternal consolation that all
   created things could give them, therefore no temptation can be hurtful
   to them. Neither will any impulse to sin from lower motives affect
   them, for their will and their desire is that they may always have
   something to suffer, and that in true humility they may be found
   well-pleasing unto God, Who loves them. That we may thus preserve this
   state of virginity, may God help us. Amen.

  SERMON IX

      On The Annunciation of our Lady

   How we must commune with God and commit ourselves to Him; that we may
   conceive God and bear Him in our spirits, souls, and bodies, after the
   example of the blessed Mother of God.

   Ave, gratia plena, Dominus tecum, Benedicta tu in mulieribus.

   "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among
   women."

   This festival is one of great dignity, and shows the eternal fervent
   love whereby the God of Gods and Lord of Lords, the Son of God had
   compassion on us poor sinful and accursed brands of hell. When He was
   in His Divine Glory, He "thought it not robbery," as St Paul says, "to
   be equal with God; but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant,
   being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man, He
   humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the
   Cross." [14] None can speak enough of this love, nor praise God, nor
   thank Him enough for it; for it is beyond the understanding of men and
   of Angels that our Lord, our God and Supreme Judge, should become our
   Father, our Brother, and our Husband. He has taken our guilt and
   condemnation upon Himself, and has redeemed us by His bitter Death, and
   has made us the children of everlasting life, and has brought us back
   to our first glory. Yea, and beyond, for we have become like unto the
   Angels; and we now posses more righteousness and are nearer akin unto
   God than the Archangels.

   O, the goodness of God! Who can so withstand this great love, that he
   does not love and praise Thee with all his powers? This work of our
   redemption makes Thee dear to us above all things. It is a work which
   has no like; humility unbounded, grace undeserved, a gift without
   return. This work claims our love, draws our wills gently, and unites
   our desires firmly and justly to Thee. But what can we give to Thee,
   dear Lord Jesus, in return for all the great goodness that Thou hast
   shown to us? In return for my destruction of the soul Thou gavest me by
   creation, Thou hast given it back to me by redemption; so that I am
   doubly indebted to Thee, to give it wholly again to Thee. But what can
   I return to Thee, dear Lord Jesus, for that Thou hast given Thy Soul
   for mine? For, if I could give my soul again to Thee a thousand times,
   how should I thereby be any the more like unto my Lord, Who gave
   Himself even unto death for me?

   Dear children, this great love can never be repaid by us; but we must
   do our best, and give to Him again, on our own account, all that we
   are, all that we have, and all that we can do; like His dear Mother,
   the blessed Virgin, who did this most faithfully and most perfectly. I
   will tell you something about this in a figure, that ye also may become
   the mothers of our Lord in spirit, and that ye may commit yourselves
   unto God, that he may be conceived and born in your souls.

   Now, learn, how the blessed Virgin was prepared when she should
   conceive the Son of God, though her holiness cannot be perfectly
   comprehended even by the understanding of Angels. According to the
   meaning of the letters of her name, Mary, she was raised up in the
   three highest powers of her soul unto God, she became one spirit with
   God, and she was taught by Him; for she resigned herself as a fitting
   instrument to His dear Will, in fervent love for His glory. She was
   poor in spirit, and always bore herself in God with deep humility and
   self-annihilation; for she had no desires, no will, and was as passive,
   as though she were uncreated. And thus an entrance was made for God
   into her spirit, soul and body. She was pure in spirit, for she never
   clung with delight to the gifts of God, and did not use them for her
   own pleasure. She was pure in soul, for she never delighted in any
   creature, but her soul was adorned with all virtues. She was pure in
   heart and body, for she was never moved to sin; and thus she was like
   unto the bright and shining Angels. Although she was the most beautiful
   of all women, yet none could look upon her with evil desires, because
   of her angelic purity. She was fervent in spirit, for her sweet ecstasy
   and longing so moved the Divine Godhead that the fervent love of the
   Holy Trinity welled forth and was poured out upon her. She was fervent
   in soul, for all the powers of her soul were always lifted up in the
   praise of God. She was fervent in heart, for her heart was opened unto
   the Lord, and it penetrated with fervent longings the incomprehensible
   depths of the Godhead; for she found there that which she most loved;
   and, by her inner sweetness, she was well-pleasing unto the Almighty,
   clinging to the Eternal Goodness by her love to fill her with all
   things and to give her power over all that he had; for she lived not to
   herself but to Him alone, Who is the Life of all living. From first to
   last all that she did was done in God, and was full of a pure and
   godlike intention; for she was at all times united with God, and never
   turned away for an instant from His Presence. Therefore the likeness of
   no creature was ever found in her or had access to her; for, with the
   Angels, she looked on all things simply in God; and found God alone at
   all times in the depths and very being of her soul, in the innermost
   parts of her spirit. Therefore she did not go forth with all her powers
   to seek for greatness and variety, but at all times she abode simply
   outside herself in God and God in her. Most perfectly and with all her
   powers she meditated on the Source from Which she came. Poor, pure,
   fervent and divine, she was more like a heavenly creature than an
   earthly one; in spirit she was the Heaven of God; in her soul the
   Paradise of God; in her body the Palace of God; and she was filled with
   the Divine Brightness, so that she needed no mediator with God.

   Now, ye shall know, further, that God desired to be conceived and born
   of this Holy Virgin in three ways; that is in her spirit, soul and
   body. She would not have been so blessed by the birth of the body only,
   as St Augustine says, and as our Lord also implies in the Gospel, when
   He answered: "Blessed are they who hear the Word of God and keep it."
   [15] Therefore she first conceived and bare God in her spirit; for by
   her purity she was well-pleasing unto God; by her lowliness she made a
   place for God; and by her love she constrained God, so that He took up
   His abode in the depths of her spirit, in calm and absolute freedom and
   silence. God united Himself with her spirit, and spake to her His
   secret Word, and bare His only Son in her spirit with unspeakable love
   and joy. This is the Eternal Birth in Mary; and the darkness of night
   in her spirit, where the understanding is darkened. Where the uncreated
   light arises, no created light can abide; for night is turned into day;
   that is, the created light of the soul is transformed into the Light of
   Eternity. Thus Mary yielded up her spirit to the uncreated Being of the
   Godhead, and her soul sank down in deep humility.

   Thereby she drew down the sweet stream and light of Eternal Wisdom into
   her soul; and the Father begat His only Son in her soul, and fashioned
   her anew in Himself. The Father required of her that she should consent
   thereto that His only Son should take His Human Nature upon Himself in
   her, and should be born of her in body, by the working of the Holy
   Ghost. She was afraid in true humility, and answered Him in spirit with
   fear: "I am not worthy, for I would gladly be the handmaid of such a
   mother." But God willed that she herself should be the Mother; then she
   sank down in utter self-abasement, and it was made known unto her that
   she had been chosen thereto; God required this of her and not anything
   else. Then the Holy Trinity shone upon her with a supernatural light
   and transparent clearness, and with a ray or dart of Divine Love she
   was transfixed in the inmost parts, so that she humbly and lovingly
   consented to be the Mother of God.

   At the same instant the angel Gabriel stood by her and found her
   exalted in spirit. He greeted her reverently, saying: "Hail, full of
   grace, the Lord is with thee." [16] She was troubled by this lofty
   greeting, because of her deep humility, and also because she was
   entirely absorbed in God. Then, when she spake: "Behold the handmaid of
   the Lord," [17] the Holy Ghost took of the purest blood of her virgin
   heart, that had been set alight by the powerful flame of love, and
   created therewith a pure and perfect little Body, with all its members,
   and a pure and holy Soul, and united them together. This, the Person of
   the Son of God, who is the Eternal Word, and the Brightness of the
   Glory of the Father, took unto Himself and united it with Himself in
   Unity of Persons, and out of true love and mercy for our salvation.
   Thus, "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."

   This is the third birth that took place in the virgin body of Mary,
   without hurt to her virginal purity; and thus she became the Daughter
   of the Father; the Mother of the Son; the Bride of the Holy Ghost; the
   Queen of Heaven; the Mistress of the world and of all creatures; the
   Mother of all men who desire her help; the Temple of God, wherein God
   has rested as a Bridegroom in His chamber in great bliss; for the
   Virgin's body was as a garden full of sweet-smelling herbs and of all
   kinds of virtues and graces. With these virtues she caused the Heaven
   of the Holy Trinity to flow with honey for us poor sinners. She has
   brought forth the Sun of Righteousness, she has chased away the curse
   of Eve, and bruised the head of the wicked serpent. This second Eve,
   with her Child, has restored all that the first Eve had lost and
   destroyed; she has, besides, brought much more grace and wealth. This
   is the noble Star which arose out of Jacob, which was prophesied in a
   Book of Moses, whose light shall lighten the whole world. "Therefore,"
   says Bernard, "in all thy need, fix thine eyes on this Star, call on
   Mary, and then thou wilt not despair, follow Mary and thou canst not go
   astray. She will hold thee up, by the power of her Child, so that thou
   will not fall; she will protect thee, so that thou wilt not despond;
   she will lead thee to her Child, so that thou mayest overcome." She has
   the power, indeed; for the Almighty God is her Child; she is indeed
   willing to do this, for she is merciful. For who can doubt that a child
   would honour his mother, or that she overflows with love, in whom God
   Himself has dwelt.

   He, therefore, who desires to commune more and more with himself; and
   to find himself in his Source, in God, and to be conscious of God in
   his heart (which is conformed to God and inclines to Him, and cleaves
   to God, as a ray to the sun) he must copy the likeness and the bright
   mirror of our Lady, and comport himself as she did, both outwardly and
   inwardly; then he will become conscious in himself of great help from
   her, both in spirit and in nature. First, he must turn away from all
   transitory things, and gather up the powers of his mind, and commune
   with himself, and pass over out of self into God, Who is present within
   him, in the innermost parts of his spirit, wherein are the three
   highest powers of the soul, that there he may be united with and become
   one spirit with God; and there God will work in him. His memory will be
   made fruitful, his understanding will be transfigured, his will
   inflamed and inebriated with Divine Love. God Himself becomes the Food
   of his spirit, the Life of his soul, and the Preserver and Guardian of
   his body. Therefore at all times we ought to commune with the image or
   the ground of our souls, where the three powers of our souls are one
   with God, that we may be united with God, poor in spirit, soul and
   body, fervent, and communing with God with all our powers, so that we
   may begin and end all our works with a pure intention to the glory of
   God; for thus it was written beforetimes of the blessed Mother of God.
   Thus we must remain empty, bare and dead to all around us, that all the
   powers of our souls may continue in the place appointed for them, and
   our wills, desires and intentions may be obedient to God in all things,
   that God may work with us according to His dear will. Then man will be
   lifted up in himself by God above all powers into the wilderness of the
   Godhead, his spirit will sink deep in the Divine Union, and his whole
   being will be saturated with the Divine Being, so that the Divine Birth
   will take place without let or hindrance in our spirits, in our souls,
   and also spiritually in our bodies, from the gifts which break forth
   and overflow from soul and spirit into the body.

   That we may now and later, receive blessings through the intercession
   of the dear Mother of God, let us call on her with St Bernard, who
   says: "Through thee must we find an entrance to thy Son, O blessed
   finder of grace, bearer of life, mother of holiness, that He may
   receive us through thee, Who was given to us through thee. Thy purity
   must exonerate the guilt of our uncleanness in His sight, and thy
   humility, so pleasing unto God, must win pardon for our vanity, thy
   overflowing love must cover the multitude of our sins. Thy honourable
   fruitfulness gains for us the fruitfulness of they merits. O, elect
   Lady, our mediator and intercessor, commend us to thy Son, intercede
   for us with thy Son. Do thou see to it, O blessed one, by the grace
   that thou hast found, the election that thou hast earned, and the mercy
   that thou hast borne, that He Who condescended through thee to take our
   sicknesses and our misery upon Him, may also by His intercession enable
   us to participate in His glory and blessedness," Jesus Christ, Who with
   Father and the Holy Ghost is blessed for ever. Amen.

  SERMON X

      On the Nativity of John the Baptist the First Sermon

   Of the spiritual Birth of Divine Grace in man from the ground of
   humility and the acknowledgment of his own frailty. How man may ever
   attain more and more to a Birth so full of Grace.

   Johannes est nomen ejus.

   "John is his name."

   To-day we read of and celebrate the birthday of Saint John the Baptist.
   The birthday of no other saint is kept in this way, only that of this
   holy Baptiser of God. The name of John means one in the state of grace.
   This must always precede the birth of grace.

   I spoke yesterday of two kinds of affliction. The first is in our
   nature, and results from the first Fall of man; the second in an
   affliction of blindness. Man is prone to sin from the beginning; it is
   rooted in his nature. This affliction ought always to be repugnant to
   man; and he should turn away from it with all his might, because it is
   hateful to God. The second kind of affliction is the result of the
   first; it is pain and misery. When this kind of affliction falls upon
   man, it ought to be acceptable and pleasing unto him, so that he may be
   able to follow therein the Example of our Lord, Who throughout His
   whole life always endured great and grievous sufferings.

   Now God often allows the affliction of frailty to come upon men, that
   in their downfall they may learn to know themselves better, and to love
   and remain willingly in the way of blindness, in them. Children, it
   were good for them to resolve to remain in this way. Man must always
   learn to abase himself in this most blessed way of blindness, in
   disease, in doing nothing and in being nothing. Oh! he who would thus
   exercise himself in this way and understand it, disciplining himself
   only by despising unceasingly his own want of power; in this man,
   verily, would the grace of God be born. Man possesses nothing of
   himself; all comes from God only, without any intervention; all things
   both great and small come from Him; not from man himself; for he
   corrupts all that is good, both outwardly and inwardly; and, if there
   be anything good, it is none of his. Man must never forget this; he
   must look into his own nothingness and see how inclined he is to all
   that is evil, whenever nature is allowed her own way. He must be very
   diligent in learning to know himself; on what foundation he rests, his
   opinions, his love, his diligence; whether, perchance, ill weeds have
   grown up in his heart. The heart must be pure, only revealing itself to
   God; and it must have no thoughts but of Him. Also, thou must examine
   thine outer walk, thy words and works, thy customs and position, thy
   clothes and thy companions, from all sides. Wherever thou findest that
   something or other has gone wrong in thy life, thou must in sorrow
   bewail it unto God, and acknowledge thy guilt, and send up a sigh to
   God; and thus it is immediately condemned. This inner groaning from the
   depths of the heart is very useful and good. The Apostles did not
   experience it on account of their sins, but on account of all the evil
   that remained in man; and they exercised it unceasingly, because of the
   many ways by which they came to God. Thus, when a glimpse and taste of
   unity )with God) is made known unto man, an inner groaning is born in
   him, which passes out through his outer senses. This is truly the altar
   which stands outside, before the Holy of Holies, where the goats and
   oxen are offered to God. Thus man also offers his flesh and blood to
   Jesus Christ. By this contemplation of his own frailty, man must humble
   himself, casting himself down at the Feet of God, that He may have
   mercy on him. He must hope that God will pass over his guilt; and thus
   John, that is grace, is born out of the ground of humility; for the
   lower we get the higher we shall be. St Bernard says: "All acts of
   discipline that are done outwardly are in no wise to be compared to
   those which man does in the valley of humiliation." In this valley row
   meekness, goodness calmness and patience; and this is truly the right
   way. Those who do not walk in this way must assuredly go astray. And,
   however much they may do in outward discipline, it will not really help
   them at all; they will anger God much more than they will appease Him.

   Now we will proceed with the Gospel. Here is a portion of it. Zacharias
   was the high priest. He and his wife were barren; and this was a great
   disgrace to him. Zacharias went into the Holy of Holies, and the people
   remained without, standing, while he executed the priestly function.
   Then the angel Gabriel stood by the altar and announced to him that a
   child should be born unto him who should be called John, which means
   that he was given grace. Zacharias did not fully believe this;
   therefore he became dumb till all had been fulfilled.

   The word Zacharias means "thinking of God," or "the remembrance of
   God." This godly man, that is a spiritual man, must be a priest, and
   must go into the Holy of Holies while the people remain without. Now,
   mark, what his nature is, what his office is, and whose priest he is.
   The office of the priest is to offer God's only-begotten Son to His
   heavenly Father for the people. Now I fear, and it is most probable,
   that all priests are not perfect; and, if some priests were to
   represent Christianity in their own persons, they would be more likely
   to hinder and lead others astray than to help them; and they would
   anger rather than appease God. But they execute their holy office in
   the person and in the place of the Holy Catholic Church; therefore they
   execute their office sacramentally; and in this way it can be done by
   men only. They, and no others, as clergy, may consecrate and bless the
   sacred Body of our Lord; inasmuch as they are priests in all that
   belongs to their office, that is to the sacrifice. In a spiritual sense
   it may be done as well by a woman as by a man. If a woman does it in
   this way, she enters into the Holy of Holies, and the common people
   remain without. She must enter in alone; she must collect her thoughts,
   and commune with her own heart; and she must leave all things
   pertaining to the senses without, and offer to the Heavenly Father, the
   Sacrifice of Love; namely, His dear Son, with all His Words, His Works,
   His Suffering and Holy Life, that she may obtain all that she desires
   and all that is her intention. This she must do in deep devotion,
   including all men, all poor sinners, the good, and those who are
   imprisoned in the fires of purgatory; for by this means she will have
   great power.

   Albertus Magnus writes that the custom of the high priest was as
   follows: "He went into the Holy of Holies, and took with Him the blood
   of a red heifer, and fire that was burning. When he entered in, he put
   the blood on all the golden vessels, and made a heap of the finest
   herbs, and lighted it; and a sweet smelling savour arose therefrom,
   like unto a mist; then God came and spake with him."

   This high priest is the inner man, who thus enters into his inmost
   soul, bearing with him the Sacred Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   the fire of devotion and love, and all the golden vessels which are
   marked with this Blood, even all those who have received the grace of
   God, and all those who shall yet receive it, and the poor souls who
   still wait in purgatory. All shall be comforted and uplifted by this
   priestly office. Children, ye know not how sweet this is. This man
   shall also raise himself up thereby, even unto the Heart of the Father,
   and His Fatherly Will; and in Him he shall do whatever pleases Him in
   time and eternity.

   Some say: "If we commune with our hearts after this inward fashion, we
   shall allow the image of our Lord's Sufferings to escape us." No,
   children, ye must look into your own hearts, where grace only can be
   born in truth; and there the Life and Sufferings of our Lord will gleam
   and shine in upon you, in sweet love and simplicity, in a single
   vision. It will seem as though all stood before you; not in its own
   many-sidedness, as I might see you all in one glance, but as though
   each one stood alone before me. This vision will be more useful to
   thee, than standing for five months in thought, striving to understand.
   During this sacred priestly office, when the man has entered alone, and
   is standing in silence, with all his powers on the alert, Gabriel, the
   Angel of God, is standing by the altar, where the divine and holy
   office is to be performed. Gabriel means the divine power that will be
   given to this priest, that he may be able to do all things in our Lord.
   This priest makes a heap of herbs, and sets it alight; and a smoke
   arises therefrom in which God speaks to him. This heap represents a
   collection of holy virtues, such as humility, meekness, and many other
   virtues of that description; for the life of a man who has no virtues,
   and does not strive to get them, either in the lowest, the middle, or
   the highest grade, is all false and worthless. A fire is kindled in
   this collection by the flame of love; and a mist and darkness arise, in
   which thy spirit will be caught away, perhaps for the space of half an
   "Ave Maria," and thou wilt be robbed of thy senses and of thy reason.
   In this darkness God will speak to thee in truth, as it is written: Dum
   medium silentium, etc. For, when silence reigned over all things, and
   the night of darkness had run its course, these words were sent from
   above from the kingly Throne. Here a secret word was spoken, and the
   ears caught the sound thereof. Here was foretold the birth of him, who
   was to be great and at whose birth many should rejoice. He was to be
   born of Elizabeth; which means that there would be a divine fulfilment;
   for thus it had been prophesied, that this joyful birth should take
   place. But all this took place in the lowest powers. Now come those who
   are wise in their own eyes, and whose empty, bare, uncultured hearts
   are lighted only by the light of nature; for they have nothing but the
   light of nature, and that which pertains thereto; it is to them as God,
   and yet it is nothing but their nature. There is however, more delight
   therein than in all sensual delights; and when they act thus
   themselves, and are endowed with these qualities, they become the worst
   and the most harmful of men. They may be known by the following signs.
   They do not walk in the paths of virtue and the discipline which
   belongs to a holy life. They give no heed to the destruction of vice;
   for they love their own false poverty, which has never been tested by
   real love, either from within or from without; and they have long ago
   parted with its likeness. Then the Devil comes, and lures them with
   false sweetness and false light; and thus he leads them astray, that
   they may be lost eternally. He leads them into whatsoever he finds them
   most inclined to by nature: unchastity, or covetousness, or pride; and
   they speak of their inner experiences and the lights which the Devil
   holds before them, as though they were of God; and they will not allow
   themselves to be separated from that which they have made their own.
   Thus, seeking those things to which they are inclined by nature, they
   fall into unholy license. These men must be shunned even more than the
   Enemy; for, as far as man can see, in their outward appearance they are
   so like righteous men, that it is hard to distinguish them. But the
   righteous differ from them by walking in the paths of virtue--humility,
   fear, resignation and meekness. They are full of fear, and dare not
   allow themselves any liberty. They never trust in themselves; they are
   in much perplexity and difficulty, and long for the help of God. But
   those who think themselves to be free are bold, wilful, contentious and
   impatient; and any one who approaches them soon finds that they are in
   difficulties, full of bitterness, angry words, and pride, and will
   neither be despised nor disparaged. Oh! what marvellings and
   lamentations there will be over that which now looks so beautiful, in
   another world, where they will not be able to turn either one way or
   the other, where they must burn for ever. I counsel you in all
   faithfulness to guard yourselves from this.

   Oh! dear children, turn your eyes inwardly, where this birth must
   really be born, which will cause great joy throughout Christendom. Now,
   ye need no longer be anxious whether ye are right or wrong. Ye have had
   the difference clearly placed before you, if ye will consider whether
   ye have chosen the right or the crooked path; whether ye have taken it
   in the lowest, the middle, or the highest grade. When this birth takes
   place, there is such great joy of heart, that none can express it. May
   God preserve all, so that none may be led astray; and be drawn away and
   diverted. Our Lord says in the Book of Love: "I adjure you, by the roes
   and the harts of the fields, that ye make not My beloved to awake till
   she please." [18] Again, they must not question unwise teachers, who
   might prove so misleading, that some might be tempted away, and never
   return for forty or fifty years. These men must give heed to
   themselves; for this joy is so great that it wells up like wine
   fermenting in the barrel. It is better that it should burst forth, than
   that nature should be too weak, and blood should pour from nose and
   mouth. But this is still far removed from the highest grade, still
   remaining below in the senses.

   But the Angel said that he who should be born, must "drink no wine nor
   strong drink;" which means that the man in whom this birth was to be
   born would be led by the upper way, in the highest grade; for he should
   be good, better and the very best. These men must not drink anything
   that can intoxicate, like those, of whom we have already spoken, who
   were intoxicated by pleasure, which was poured out for them, either in
   a real or imaginary way, either by sight or by use; but they are placed
   in and led along a narrow way, which is also dark and dreary. There
   they find themselves unbearable oppressed, so that they cannot get out;
   and, whichever way they turn, they find fathomless misery, and all is
   desert, dark and dreary. They must face it, and in all their ways trust
   in the Lord, as long as it pleases Him; and, lastly, the Lord makes as
   though He knew nothing of their pain and torment; all seems unbearable
   need and great longing; but still they are resigned. This is a thorough
   cleansing, which corresponds to the highest reward; for other men there
   are corresponding rewards.

   St Thomas says of this: "Great external works, however great they may
   be, inasmuch as they are works, have their own reward. But when the
   Spirit looks within, to the Spirit of God, from the ground of the
   heart, where man, empty and bare of all works, seeks God only, far
   above all thoughts, works and reason, it is truly a thorough
   conversion, which will ever met with a corresponding reward, and God
   will be with him." Another conversion may take place in an ordinary
   external way, whenever man turns to God, thinking wholly and entirely
   of Him, and of nothing else but of God for Himself and in Himself. But
   the first turning is in an inner, undefined, unknown presence, in an
   immaterial entrance of the created spirit into the uncreated Spirit of
   God. If a man could only once in his life thus turn to God, it would be
   well for him. Those men whose God is so powerful, and Who has been so
   faithful to them in all their distress, will be answered by God with
   Himself. He draws them so mysteriously unto Himself and His own
   blessedness; their spirits are so lovingly attracted, while they are at
   the same time so filled and transfused with the Godhead, that they lose
   all their diversity in the Unity of the Godhead. These are they to whom
   God makes their work here on earth a delight; so that they have a real
   foretaste of that which they will enjoy for ever. These are they on
   whom the Holy Christian Church rests; and, if they did not form part of
   Christianity, Christianity could no longer exist; for their mere
   existence, what they are, is infinitely worthier and more useful than
   all the doings of the world. These are they of whom our Lord has said:
   "He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of Mine eye." Therefore, take
   heed that ye do them no wrong. May God help us. Amen.

  SERMON XI

      On the Feast of the Nativity of St John the Baptist

      The Second Sermon

   How man must prepare himself and hold himself in readiness to bear
   witness to the true Divine Light which shines into his heart, in the
   lowest and highest powers, and on which depend his Salvation and
   Blessedness.

   Hic venit in testimonium, ut testimonium perbiberet de lumine

   "This man came for a witness to give testimony of the light."

   To-day the Church celebrates the Feast of St John the Baptist. To bless
   and to praise him in words only would be but a little thing for us to
   do, because our Lord Himself has praised him worthily, and has said of
   him: "There hath not risen among them that are born of woman a greater
   than John the Baptist." [19] He also said of him: "But what went ye out
   to see? a man clothed in soft garments? or did ye go out into the
   desert to see a reed shaken with the wind?" No, he was none of these
   things. Jesus said of him: "He is a voice of one crying in the desert,
   Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths!" [20] We sing
   of him that he was a burning lamp. St John the Evangelist, who is
   likened unto a soaring eagle, wrote of him that "he bore witness to the
   light."

   Dear children, how could we praise this exalted prince of Heaven
   better, or more worthily, than with these words, "that he was a witness
   to the true Light?" This true Divine Light shines into the very depths
   of man's heart; and when this Divine Light and witness comes to man and
   commends itself inwardly unto him, he turns quite away from the pure
   ground. He ought verily to await it; but he does just the reverse,
   running first one way and then another, so that he cannot receive the
   true witness because of his shallowness. "He came unto His own, and His
   own received him not." Such men are opposed to the true Divine Light.
   Their hearts are worldly; and, as the Baptist said to the hypocrites:
   "They are a generation of vipers." These men are opposed to all those
   who love the true Divine Light, and they give good cause for alarm, for
   they seem, as it were, scarcely to hang by a thread to light and faith.

   Now, we must show here, how shortsighted and diseased nature is, and
   how of itself it can do nothing that is good. God has therefore given
   it supernatural help and strength, even the light of grace, which lifts
   nature far up above itself, and supplies it with all it needs in this
   way. The uncreated Light of Glory shines above, even the Divine Light;
   and this Light is God Himself. Therefore, if we would truly know God,
   it must be by God and with God, in God and by God. As the prophet says:
   "Lord, in thy light we shall see light," that is a supernatural light.
   The same Divine Light, "lightens every man who comes into the world,"
   and shines on all men, both on the evil and on the good, as the bright
   sun shines on all creatures. It is their own fault if they are blind.
   For in the same way that a man in a dark room could get light, if he
   found a window open, by putting his head outside, so may men also come
   to this light, and bear witness to it.

   Now, we must mark diligently how a man shall first bear himself towards
   this witness, so that he may truly receive it. He must flee and
   separate himself from all that is temporal and transitory; for the true
   witness is given both to the lowest and highest powers of the soul. The
   lowest power is that of passion and desire. Desire is the love of
   pleasure, which this witness must take away. This power must first
   separate itself from the lusts of the flesh, whatever they may be, in
   which the man finds satisfaction; either in human beings or clothing;
   in short, in whatever his senses find delight. God does not grudge man
   the necessaries of life; but this is verily a wilderness in which the
   voice of God cries; and it is called a life of seclusion. It is a
   separation from all the spiritual and natural pleasures, both outwardly
   and inwardly.

   Second, this witness is given in the power of passion in the soul, that
   man may learn true steadfastness and strength; that he may become, if
   he has received this witness aright, immovable as a mountain of iron.
   As Christ testified of St John, man must not allow himself to be shaken
   to and fro like a reed; neither must he be like unto one who wears soft
   clothing; by which we may understand one who loves, desires and seeks
   his bodily ease. Now, many a man may be found who despises all this for
   the sake of God, but who is so like a bending reed that it is quite
   pitiful. Such a man is as much moved and disturbed by some absurd
   mockery, or by a hard word, as the reed is in the water. Now, dear
   friend, how can a word harm thee, which can in nowise hurt thy soul?
   But then comes the Evil One and suggests first one thing and then
   another to thee, till thou art sore troubled; but all this ought not so
   to be, if otherwise thou wert firm in the faith. Later, this witness is
   given in the highest power of all, in the reason, the will and the love
   of man; for it is a prophet to the reason of man's soul; a prophet
   means one who sees far off. Reason, in fact, sees so far that it is a
   perfect marvel. If an enlightened man existed, who yet was not standing
   on this ground, who heard secret, divine things, his heart would bear
   him witness thereof, and it would speak to him within.

   Now, Jesus Christ said that John was more than a prophet, even in that
   ground where reason cannot come. For there truly man sees light in
   light, in the inner light of the soul; for there the Divine Light may
   be seen and understood by the light of grace. First, in a hidden way.
   The powers of the soul cannot attain to this divine ground; and the
   great wastes to be found in this divine ground have neither image, nor
   form, nor condition; for they are neither here nor there. They are like
   unto a fathomless abyss, bottomless and floating in itself. Even as
   water ebbs and flows, up and down, now sinking into a hollow, so that
   it looks as if there was no water there, and then again, in a little
   while, rushing forth as though it would engulf everything, so does it
   come to pass in this Abyss. This, truly, is much more God's
   Dwelling-place than heaven or man. A man, who verily desires to enter
   in, will surely find God here, and himself simply in God, for God never
   separates Himself from this ground. God will be present with him, and
   he will find and enjoy eternity here. There is no past or present here;
   and no created light can reach unto or shine into this divine ground;
   for here only is the Dwelling-place of God and His sanctuary. Now this
   Divine Abyss can be fathomed by no creatures; it can be filled by none,
   and it satisfies none; God only can fill it in His Infinity. For this
   abyss belongs only to the Divine Abyss, of which it is written: Abyssus
   abyssum incocat.

   He who is truly conscious of this ground, which shone into the powers
   of his soul, and lighted and inclined its lowest and highest powers to
   turn to their pure Source and true Origin, must diligently examine
   himself, and remain alone, listening to the voice which cries in the
   wilderness of this ground.

   This ground is so desert and bare, that no thought has ever entered
   there. None of all the thoughts of men, which, with the help of reason,
   have been devoted to meditation on the Holy Trinity, (and some men have
   occupied themselves much with these thoughts), have ever entered this
   ground. For it is so close, and yet so far off, and so far beyond all
   things, that it has neither time nor place. It is a simple and
   unchanging condition. A man, who really and truly enters, feels as
   though he had been here throughout eternity, and as though he were one
   therewith; whereas it is only for an instant, and the same glance is
   found and reveals itself in eternity. It shines forth; and God thus
   bears witness that man existed in God from all eternity, before his
   creation; that is, he was in God, and thus man was God in God. For St
   John says: "All things were made by Him," that means one life in Him.
   That which man was in himself when created, that he was eternally in
   God. As long as a man does not attain to the purity with which he came
   forth, when first created out of nothing, he will never truly come to
   God. For all inclinations, propensities, and self-esteem, all that can
   defile the ground in our own possession, must assuredly be cast out;
   and also, all that we have ever possessed with delight and our own
   consent in soul and body; all that we have ever received by knowledge
   or inclination, all, all must first be rooted out, so that we may be as
   we were when we first came forth from God. Because we do not act thus,
   we never return to the Source from which we sprang; neither is purity
   enough, unless our spirits are transformed by the Light of Grace. Now,
   if we willingly sought after this transformation, and communed with
   ourselves in our inmost hearts, ordering our conversation aright, at
   such a time our souls and spirits might well experience a bright
   glimpse of the highest transformation; although no one can come to God,
   nor know God, except in Uncreated Light, which is God Himself. The holy
   prophet says: Lord, "in Thy light we shall see light." Therefore, if a
   holy man communes often in his inmost heart in secret, many a glimpse
   will be vouchsafed to him in his inmost heart; and what God is will be
   made much clearer and plainer to him, than the natural sun is to his
   bodily eyes.

   This pure ground was hidden from the heathen; therefore they despised
   all temporal and transitory things, and went in search of it. But
   afterwards the great masters, such as Proclus and Plato, arose, and
   they gave a clear description of it, to those men who could not find it
   of themselves. Therefore St Augustine said that Plato had fully taught
   the holy Gospel, "in principio erat verbum," even unto the words: "Fuit
   homo missus a Deo;" but this was in veiled words. These same heathen
   masters discerned also the Holy Trinity; and all this came from the
   inmost ground, for which they lived and waited. It is a great disgrace
   and shame, a miserable and pitiful thing, that we, poor blinded people,
   who are left, should go on through long years, even unto death, like
   blind creatures, not knowing ourselves, nor what is concealed in us,
   knowing nothing about ourselves. Yet we are Christians, and are so
   called, and have great and exceeding help from the Grace of God,
   besides possessing the holy faith and the Blessed Sacrament, and many
   other great and divine helps. Now this is caused entirely by the great
   fickleness and superficiality, which pervert and trouble us. We are
   always anxious to occupy ourselves with outward things; our own
   efforts, our many prayers, readings, studies and so on, which are all
   of our own self-seeking, with which we occupy ourselves, and which keep
   us back, so that we cannot commune with ourselves, bare and empty in
   the inmost depths of our hearts. And yet, he who does not fill the
   noble vessel of his soul with fine balsam, will fill it with bad wine.
   Truly, if man would do this, it would be much pleasing unto God, Who
   desires to receive from him his best and noblest works.

   There is yet another witness in the highest powers, the power of love,
   which is in the will. Have we not this week sung of St John the
   Baptist: Lucerna lucens et arden, etc. "He was a burning and shining
   light." A lamp gives heat and light; thou canst feel the heat with thy
   hand; and yet thou canst not see the fire, unless thou lookest at it
   from above; and thou seest not the light, unless thou seest it through
   the shade. He who marked this meaning well, and was then conscious of
   the light and heat, would know that this is wounded love, which shall
   truly guide thee into this ground. Therefore, when thou comest into
   this ground, thou must wrestle and struggle with love, and set thy bow
   upon the Most Highest.

   But if thou comest into imprisoned love, into that secret, deep abyss,
   thou must yield thyself in the depths of love entirely; thou hast lost
   all power over thyself; for there thou wilt find neither thought, nor
   exercise of power, nor the works of virtue. But, if thou findest there
   so much space, and thou art so bare that a thought comes to thee, and
   thou fallest again into imprisoned love, then thou must brace thyself
   at once, and raise thyself up, and wrestle vehemently with love; and
   desire, beseech and importune love. If thou canst not speak, think and
   long; and then speak as St Augustine spoke: "Lord, Thou commandest me
   to love Thee with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my strength
   and with all my mind; therefore, grant, O Lord, that I may love Thee
   above all things." If thou feelest so dull that thou canst not think
   thus, open thy mouth and say so. Those men, who make no effort, but sit
   down, as though all were accomplished, never attain to this exalted
   love. After this comes the love which wells forth.

   Fourthly comes stormy, raging love. Love has perished quite, and reason
   has taken its place. Man is never so reasonable as he now generally
   becomes; for stormy, raging love may be compared to a lamp; man becomes
   conscious of the heat of that love, for it causes a disturbance in all
   his powers. Man always longs for this love; and when he has it he does
   not know it himself; for it consumes the blood and marrow in his bones.
   Therefore, heed thyself diligently, that thou mayest not destroy thy
   natural powers with all thy efforts. If love is to do her work, so that
   thou canst not withdraw thyself from her, thou must follow her through
   all her storms, and in all her external works. Some men say they will
   guard themselves from all these storms, that they may not be disgraced;
   for such doings are not in keeping with their position. Therefore, when
   irrational love comes, all human work is swallowed up, and God comes
   and speaks to those men. This word is more useful than hundreds of
   thousands of words that could be spoken by any man. St Dionysius says:
   "When the external word has been uttered in the depths of the soul, and
   the ground has been so prepared and made ready, that it can receive the
   word in all its dignity and entirety, and can bring it forth, not only
   partially but completely, that ground becomes one with the word; and
   yet it retains its own essential being, even in that union." Our Lord
   Jesus Christ bore witness to this when He said: "That they all may be
   one, as Thou, Father, art in Me and I in Thee." As He also said to St
   Augustine: "Thou shalt be changed into Me, and not I into thee." Dear
   children, I tell you of a truth, that none can attain to this but by
   the path of love.

   Now St John the Baptist said, that he was "a voice in the wilderness,
   to prepare the way of the Lord;" that is, the path of virtue; that path
   is very plain. He said also: "Make straight His paths." Paths are often
   more even than ways. Therefore, whoever can really find the right path,
   which leads to the true ground of God, while at the same time he is
   conscious of his own ground, he must, before all things, remain alone,
   and diligently seek the footpath, which is very wild, dark, rough,
   unknown, distant and strange to him. For the man who diligently gives
   heed to all these things, no calamity or perplexity, either external or
   internal, is too great or too small; neither any infirmity which may
   befall him; for they will guide, allure and urge him on to the right
   ground.

   The paths must also be made straight from within; we must seek them
   diligently; our spirits in God and God in us; for the paths are dark
   and unknown. Many men go astray, running after external works and
   discipline. They act like one who, in going to Rome, ought to ascend;
   whereas, if the road diverged, the further he went, the further he
   would go astray. It is thus that these men act; for often, when they
   come back from external exercises, they have become old and ill, and
   their heads ache; and there is not enough of this love in their works,
   because of their passions.

   Therefore, when a man finds himself in this storm of love, he must not
   think of his senses, or of humility, or of anything else, but only,
   whether in his works he has enough love. Man struggles also in love
   against coldness, indifference and harshness. Man should devote himself
   entirely to love, and render full allegiance, being poor and miserable
   in all that is not love. Herein must thou have a steady ardent desire
   and full trust in God; and thou must keep thy heart pure for the Love
   of God; then thou wilt find such great and noble things in the Love of
   God, that thou wilt not be able to give utterance to them. Therefore,
   all men, whose faith and trust in God are not quite pure, will sink
   lower; love will be extinguished in their hearts, and their lives will
   be fruitless. I say unto thee, if thou hadst all the marks thou
   couldest possess here below, and this witness to the Love of God was
   wanting, all would be lost. Therefore the Evil One readily leaves all
   other virtues to man, as long as he does not posses the witness of true
   love. He will allow thee to have deceitful love, so that thou mayest
   imagine thou hast true love; but, if thou couldest see into the depths
   of thy heart, thou wouldest soon find out how it stood with thy love.
   Therefore, know, that all that is lacking in you, is nothing else but
   that you have not entered into the right ground; for, if ye truly
   entered there, ye would find the Grace of God, and it would exhort you
   unceasingly to lift up your minds above yourselves. This divine
   exhortation is constantly resisted by many men, and that so often, that
   they become unworthy of Divine Grace thereby; so that perhaps they will
   never become partakers of it; for they spoil it altogether with their
   lives which seem to them so good. Were they obedient to the glance of
   the Grace of God, they would be led thereby, and be brought into such
   Divine Union, that even in this life they would experience that which
   they will enjoy everlastingly in the life to come. This has been the
   experience of many holy men, who have been led by God along this lofty
   way; and He still leads others by it, who open their hearts to Him. God
   grant that this also may be our experience. Amen.

  SERMON XII

      On the Feast of St Timothy, or the Memorial of St Peter

   Of brotherly rebuke and admonition, how far it is advisable and seemly
   or not; and especially how Prelates and Governors ought to demean
   themselves towards their subjects.

   Argue, obsecra, increpa, in omni patientia et doctrina.

   "Reprove, entreat, rebuke, in all patience and doctrine."

   This is the lesson which St Paul gives to his beloved disciple Timothy,
   whom he set to rule over men; and it equally behoves Father-confessors
   and all Magistrates to possess these two things, patience and doctrine.
   First, it is their office to rebuke all open sinners whom they may
   possibly bring to a better way, and especially those over whom they are
   set in authority, that they may reveal the truth unto them; for this is
   needful, and in many places Scripture doth tell us how we ought to
   teach, entreat and rebuke those who are committed to our charge, each
   according to the office which he holds; as St Gregory has sufficiently
   shown and set forth in his book on "Pastoral Care;" wherefore we will
   refrain for the present from saying more on that point.

   But we will rather turn to the second point, which is more spiritual;
   teaching a man to look within and judge himself; seeing that he who
   desires to become a spiritual man must not be ever taking note of
   others, and above all of their sins, lest he fall into wrath and
   bitterness, and a judging spirit towards his neighbours. My children,
   this works such great mischief in a man's soul as it is miserable to
   think of; wherefore, as you love God, shun this evil temper, and turn
   your eyes full upon yourselves, and see if you cannot discover the same
   fault in yourselves, either in times past or now-a-days. And, if you
   find it, remember how that it is God's appointing that you shall now
   behold this sin in another, in order that you may be brought to
   acknowledge and repent of it; and amend your ways and pray for your
   brother, that God may grant him repentance and amendment according to
   His Divine Will. Thus a good heart draws amendment from the sins of
   others, and is guarded from all harsh judgment and wrath, and preserves
   an even temper; while an evil heart puts the worst interpretation on
   all that it sees, and turns it to its own hurt. Thus is a good man able
   to maintain inviolate a due love and loyalty towards his fellow-men.

   Further, this generous love makes him hold others innocent in his
   heart; even when he sees infirmity or fault in his neighbour, he
   reflects that very likely all is not as it seems on the outside, but
   the act may have been done with a good intention; or else he things
   that God may have permitted it to take place for an admonition and
   lesson to himself; or again, as an opportunity for him to exercise
   self-control, and to learn to die unto himself by the patient endurance
   of and forbearance towards the faults of his neighbours, even as God
   has often borne many wrongs from him and had patience with his sins.
   And this would often tend more to his neighbour's improvement than all
   the efforts he could make for it in the way of reproofs or
   chastisements, even if they were done in love, (though indeed we often
   imagine that our reproofs are given in love, when it is in truth far
   otherwise). For I tell thee, dear child, if thou couldst conquer
   thyself by long-suffering and gentleness and the pureness of thy heart,
   thou wouldst have vanquished all thine enemies. It would be better for
   thee than if thou hadst won the hearts of all the world by thy writings
   and wisdom, and hadst miserably destroyed thine own soul by passing
   judgment on thy neighbours; for the Lord says, "And why beholdest thou
   the most that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam
   that is in thine own eye?"

   In thus speaking, I except those who are bound by their office in the
   Holy Christian Church to rebuke others. Let them wisely beware how they
   reprove, and for what causes, so that they rebuke none with an
   irritable demeanour, or with harsh and angry words, from which much
   trouble and toil do spring; for that they have no right to do; but it
   is permitted to them to reprove those who are under them for their own
   amendment. But, alas! it happens for the most part now-a-days that
   those who occupy the highest places do often and greatly forget
   themselves in these respects; and hence their rebukes do not produce
   any amendment, but only anger and alienation of heart. For, if they
   were to instruct those who are under their care in the fear of God, in
   such wise that the people could mark and be sure that it was done
   solely for the saving of their souls, they would be much the more ready
   to set themselves to amend, and would be content. But now, alas! they
   see that their superiors are only seeking their own glory and profit,
   and are taking upon themselves wrongfully to keep them down and defraud
   them of their just rights; and therefore reproof only makes them the
   more refractory and indignant. And there are many in authority who do
   really believe that they rebuke those under them from a reverence for
   righteousness; and yet are doing it from a wrathful, domineering and
   arrogant spirit; and what they think they are doing from hatred to sin,
   they are doing from hatred to men.

   But I beseech you examine yourselves, whether you do in truth love
   those whom you are punishing so bitterly, out of reverence and zeal for
   righteousness, as you suppose. For when we see men punishing and
   oppressing with such vehemence those who are under them, or treating
   them so harshly, with sharp words and sour looks, it is to be feared
   that there is more reproof given out of crabbed impatience than for the
   sake of righteousness from the true ground of charity and kindness,
   especially by those who have not yet experienced the inward joy of
   hearty sweetness and godly love; for the soul that has not yet
   experienced inward love and divine sweetness, does not know how to hold
   a discreet mien and just language in rebuking; but genuine love teaches
   us how we ought to treat those who are worthy of punishment.

   Now, let him who has to punish, in virtue of his office, first take
   account of God's dishonour and the injury done to the soul of his
   flock; and then rebuke with sweet, loving words, and patient demeanour
   and gestures; so that the weak shall be able to mark that he is seeking
   and purposing their welfare alone and nothing else. And, if in the
   dispensations of God's Providence it should happen that those who are
   subject should at times rise up and offend by license and presumptuous
   irreverence against their superiors, the latter ought not in any wise
   to regard or revenge it, so far as that may be without scandal to the
   rest of their subjects; for, if they revenge themselves, they fall
   under suspicion of selfish motives; and it is likely that God will not
   be able to work any fruit through them; but they must rather treat such
   offenders with more patience, kinder words and acts, than they do
   others. For this is commonly the greatest temptation which befalls
   those in authority, by which they for the most either win or lose the
   greatest reward of their labours; wherefore they should ever be on
   their guard; for gentleness and a readiness to forgive injuries is the
   best virtue that a ruler can possess.

   They shall show no partiality in their affections; neither for their
   own glory, nor yet towards particular persons; but they shall embrace
   all their flock in the arms of a common love, as a mother does her
   children. To the weak they should ever show the greatest love and care,
   and without ceasing lift up their hearts unto God in prayer, earnestly
   beseeching Him to guard and defend the people committed to their
   charge, and not indulge in any self-glorification. Likewise, so far as
   it rests with them, let them be the first to do such works as they
   would wish to see their people do; for so it stands, that, with the
   help of God, all may be accomplished to a good end, when those in
   authority are inclined to virtue; for then their subjects must needs
   follow as they lead, even though they have been beforehand inclined to
   all evil and vice, and hostile to their superiors.

   But for those who have received no commission to govern other men, but
   stand in a private character without office; it is needful that they
   secretly judge themselves inwardly, and beware of judging all things
   without, for in such judgments we do commonly err; and the true
   position of things is generally very far otherwise from that which
   appears to us, as we often come to discover afterwards. On this point
   remember the proverb: "He is a wise man who can turn all things to the
   best."

   May God help us so to do! Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SERMON XIII

      On the Feast of St Paul the Apostle

   Of an absolute dying unto self and to all things. Of the use of
   suffering; of the Love, the Suffering and the Blood of Christ.

   Vivo autem, jam non ego, vivit vero in me Christus.

   "And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me."

   St Paul had so completely died unto himself and to all things, and was
   so transformed into true love for God and for all men, that he would
   willingly have died a thousand deaths for the salvation of men; and had
   even so forgotten self, that he knew nothing save Christ crucified; and
   desired nothing, but to win all men to Christ, as though he had
   begotten all men, and were their earthly father. There are four things
   besides other virtues which will be especially useful to us, if we
   desire to imitate this exalted Apostle in true love and resignation,
   and to please God. First, we must absolutely banish and separate
   ourselves from all created things outside God. Secondly, we must forget
   and ignore all creatures. Thirdly, we must be constantly looking back
   to our origin, which means that, in God, we must long after and desire
   God with strong crying. Fourthly, we must labour that we may be more
   deeply impressed with, and fashioned in the Likeness of Christ.

   Absolute poverty is thine when thou canst not remember whether anybody
   has ever owed thee or been indebted to thee for anything; just as all
   things will be forgotten by thee in the last journey of death. If thou
   desirest in time to live above time, and to be separated from all
   creatures, thou must learn to forget thy own powers, and all that
   nature can accomplish. A constant return to thy origin means, that the
   presence of all things, in which thou canst not find God, will seem
   like a wound to thee. The labour, by which Christ is more deeply
   imprinted and formed in thee, takes place within, where Christ ever
   receives the Person, Nature and Being of His Father. The more Christ
   sees man thus choosing Him, the more clearly will Christ be found in
   him. All, who are like unto Christ in pain, bitterness and patience,
   will also be elected and chosen to be with Him, where He at all times
   partakes of the Being and Nature of His Heavenly Father. He who can
   kill and destroy his infirmities will also receive new strength from
   God; therefore in him, who devotes all the powers of his human nature
   unto Christ, Christ will pour the power of His Divine Nature. The
   loving Heart of God will be satisfied if thou diest to thy very self.

   A holy soul, which has become barren and empty of all created things,
   and which cannot form nor mould in itself anything that is of the
   creature, moves God to draw it to Himself, to the very centre of His
   Divine Being. The exit of all created things out of thy heart, brings
   about the entering in, and pouring in of all the riches of His Almighty
   Power. No one can enjoy the Presence of God, and His Likeness, like the
   man who is dead to all things, and who is as dead in heart and will as
   a thing that never possessed any being.

   The next way is to die to all things and to live to God alone. He who
   always dies to self, is always beginning to live unto God, and that
   without ceasing. In the truest death of all created things, the
   sweetest and most natural life lies hidden. There is no more natural or
   more real way of procuring Eternal Life, than by killing and dying in
   heart to all created things, and by the subjection, the submission and
   destruction of self, as beneath all creatures.

   A man once thought that God drew some men even by pleasant paths, while
   others were drawn by the path of pain. Our Lord answered him thus:
   "What think ye can be pleasanter or nobler than to be made most like
   unto Me? that is by suffering. Mark, to whom was ever offered such a
   painful and troubled life as to Me? And in whom can I better work, in
   accordance with My true nobility, than in those who are most like Me?
   They are the men who suffer. No man ever suffered so bitterly as I; and
   yet no man was ever so pure as I. When was I more mocked than when I
   was most glorifying My Heavenly Father? Learn that My Divine Nature
   never worked so nobly in human nature as by suffering; and because
   suffering is so efficacious it is sent out of great love. I understand
   the weakness of human nature at all times, and, out of love and
   righteousness, I lay no heavier burden on man than he can bear. The
   crown must be firmly pressed down that is to bud and blossom in the
   Eternal Presence of My Heavenly Father. He who desires to be wholly
   immersed in the fathomless sea of My Godhead, must also be deeply
   immersed in the deep sea of bitter sorrow. I am exalted far above all
   things, and work supernatural and wonderful works in Myself; the deeper
   and the more supernaturally a man crushes himself beneath all things,
   the more supernaturally will he be drawn far above all things.

   A man desired to know when man's nature became absolutely dead. Our
   Lord replied: "When all sins are as impossible and as hateful to thee,
   as they are to the high estate of My Divine Nature." Then the man said:
   "Ah! dear Lord, but what can cause this death?" Answer: "The presence
   of My death and of My Dying Life, during which I was always working out
   the salvation of the human race. My Death was always present to Me, and
   a consuming thirst that I might suffer for the sake of man the very
   bitterest sufferings that had been ordained for Me. It was not
   sufficient for Me to be rejected by all men; those, also, who
   acknowledged and confessed Me, must be hated and tormented as well. The
   burning thirst I felt for all men, caused the welling up of My precious
   streaming Blood; for it would have been far more bitter to Me than the
   death I suffered, had one drop of blood or water remained in my Heart,
   that I should not have poured forth for the salvation of man. As the
   seal impresses its form on the wax, so the love, with which I have
   loved man, has power to impress his form on My Hands, My Feet and My
   Divine Heart, so that I can never forget him. Even so My wounds were
   pierced with the sharp nails and pointed spear, so have I filled them
   up again with the sweet balsam of My Divine Nature, so that it may
   always freely flow forth into the weakness of human nature. My Blood is
   always a bath, boiling over in the flame of My Divine Nature, in which
   man may wash away his sins.

   "What can be sweeter and more satisfying than to work the like in him
   for whom I have suffered, and to bring forth fruit and increase in My
   dear members? Nothing is more pleasing to Me than that it should be
   made manifest how supernaturally in the power of My Love, I have worked
   and suffered for man."

   A holy man once bethought himself how painful it must have been to God
   to have been seen by his enemies when he was taken prisoner. Our Lord
   answered him: "My enemies appeared unto Me in my presence as friends,
   who wished to help me in carrying out the sweetest and most desirable
   work that I ever worked in my life." God appeared most miserable unto
   man, when, exhausted and overwhelmed, He was taken away from the column
   or pillar, and said: "Behold, how love for man has exhausted Me, ought
   it not to be sweet to Me to drink at his hand the recompense of My
   Martyrdom? See how many precious signs man may see in Me, if he looks
   upon the numberless wounds of love in Me and meditates upon my Sacred
   Passion."

   The soul is so nobly united to God, and, at first, in such a
   supernatural way, that man might justly shun, like death, every thought
   that could interfere with this union. The thought, which is to receive
   God into itself, can endure nothing strange. Therefore desire only
   invisible and inexpressible things. All will be forgotten by thee that
   can be spoken in words. "Keep silence on all that I work in thee; for I
   am precious to all creatures, because I am absolutely hidden from all
   creatures. It is natural to Me to dwell in the Heart of my Father; so
   also is it natural and dear to Me to dwell in the soul, in which I find
   rest and the likeness of my bleeding Wounds, and which I have won by
   the eternal tokens of my Fatherly Heart; and these Wounds shall
   flourish eternally in that soul before my Divine Eyes. For him for whom
   I have ordained a painful life in this world, I have also ordained the
   enjoyment in eternity of the sweetest honey of My Divine Nature. I
   cannot really enter into a man's soul until he resigns himself, and
   yields himself up in all humility, and until the old man be driven
   out." May God grant that we may follow St Paul perfectly in this, and
   in all other good exercises. Amen.

  SERMON XIV

      On the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin, or on the Octave of Her
      Nativity

   Of two ways in which men come to the Blessed Virgin. Of the temptations
   that attack men living in seclusion. Of that which they must learn by
   experience, and make their own, before they can attain to the highest
   degree of real perfection.

   Transite ad me, omnes qui concupiscitis me.

   "Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits."

   To-day we celebrate the eighth day after the Birth of our Lady. St
   Bernard and other Saints confess that they cannot praise her enough,
   and that they must perforce be silent on all the riches of her praise.
   St Bernard says: "Dear Lady, although thou hast been exalted to the
   kinship of the Godhead, forget not thy kinship with our poor human
   nature. Be not so entirely lost in the Abyss of the Godhead, that thou
   canst not also remember that human weakness by which thou also hast
   been tempted, and the many holy prayers which have been offered unto
   thee by me and by many holy Saints."

   There are two ways in which she has been treated by men. Some will not,
   and say that they cannot pray, because they desire and also must needs
   trust themselves to God's keeping, that He may do as He sees fit with
   them and all theirs. Others pray fervently to our Lady and to other
   Saints about all their affairs. There may be defects in both of these
   ways. The first err by not realising that the Holy Church has ordained
   that all men should pray. Our dear Lord taught us this Himself, and
   gave us an example and a model of prayer; for He Himself prayed to His
   Heavenly Father. These men justify their foolish notion, by saying that
   they need not worship, and that they will yet be heard, if their
   intentions are not evil. But there are some things which the Lord will
   only do in answer to prayer. Now, mark, God often allows man to fall
   into trouble, that he may be provoked unto prayer. Then God helps him,
   and hears his prayer, in order that his love may be stirred up yet
   more, and that by means of the answer he may receive comfort.

   The others also err who pray because they are impatient, and expect
   that all the things for which they pray must come to pass. They ought
   indeed to pray, but with true resignation, that in all ways and in all
   things they may gladly accept the Will of God. Now, we have lately said
   much of the way in which men, who are beginning to do better, must cut
   off all gross, course sins and all growing evil inclinations, while
   those men who have in some measure attained to perfection must root out
   their inner besetting sins.

   Now, those men, who have gone into retirement, fixing their hearts on
   God alone, desiring only to love God, and to think only of Him, are
   brought into such great temptations by the Evil One, that a man in the
   world would be terrified thereby. Temptation is common to all these
   men; and yet in each case the origin is very different. Temptation
   comes to a worldly man from an unmortified heart, from his nature, from
   flesh and blood. The temptation overpowers him, his work is destroyed;
   therefore there is nothing left for the Enemy to do, and he blazes it
   abroad. But a good man holds fast in his integrity, temptation comes to
   him from without and but little from his own heart. Thus the Enemy
   finds out some tendency in a man, even though he be pure. For instance,
   a man may naturally be inclined to anger; the Enemy discovers this, and
   attacks him with all his cunning, full of wicked deceit. He need not
   give himself so much trouble with a worldly man, for such an one
   follows immediately. He can entangle him in his toils at once, winding
   them round and round him till he is quite helpless. This is the way in
   which the Enemy treats a man whom he finds inclined to anger. He first
   of all suggests one image to him, and then another, which will rouse
   him, so that at last the man becomes angry, and he cries and clamours,
   as though he desired to beat and stab every one. But if he then comes
   to himself, and casts himself down before God in the very depths of
   humility, desiring no confessor, but making peace with man and giving
   due satisfaction, he can then cast himself down in his unworthiness and
   great sin, and then his sin will vanish from the sight of God like snow
   before the sun; all will be atoned, and the Enemy will depart thence in
   sorrow. If a man desire to act wisely in this, he must be very sincere
   and ready to get free.

   Now we must notice one sense in which this does not affect all men; and
   we poor, weak, feeble creatures, who have not experienced them, may
   well fear to speak and hear of such exalted things. For it is just
   those, who know about them, who find it is so utterly impossible to
   speak of them. Job said: "A Spirit passed before my face, when I was
   trembling; it stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof."
   [21] St Gregory understood this to mean the Sacred Humanity of our
   Blessed Lord Jesus Christ. The Form, which he saw, and did not
   recognise, was the unknown Godhead which is concealed from all
   creatures and is unknown to them. To this he added that which is
   written in the third of Kings. The Angel told Elias to go forth and
   stand upon the mount till the Lord came. When he went up, an awful
   tempest came, which was so strong that it overturned the mountain, the
   hard rocks were broken and the mountains were rent asunder; but in that
   the Lord did not come. Then there was a great and terrible earthquake;
   but in that the Lord did not come. Then there was a fierce fire; but
   neither in that did the Lord come. After all these things there was a
   still small Voice, a soft rustling like a gentle breeze; and in that
   came the Lord. Elias stood at the door of the cave, and wrapped his
   face in his mantle. In none of these ways--neither in the wind, nor the
   earthquake, nor the fire, did the Lord come; but, as St Gregory says,
   they were all a preparation and the road therein. These high mountains
   are like lofty, great minds; and the hard rocks and the earthquake are
   like minds wanting in self-control; and men who thing well of
   themselves, who hold fast to their own devices, and are self-willed and
   uncontrolled, they make great plans and do great deeds, but all in
   their own way. When the Lord comes to such men, He must first send a
   great earthquake, which will upset all that is in them.

   But, alas, there are not many such men. The reason is that men content
   themselves with the things of this life, and cleave to their evil
   nature; and thus they remain, given up to the pleasures of sense. But
   those who are rightly stirred up, either more or less (and I have seen
   many such men), have feared over and over again, that in that hour they
   must lay down their lives. A man asked our Lord what he ought to do,
   because it seemed to him, day and night, as if he must lose his life in
   this way, and whether he ought thus to endanger it. Our Lord answered
   him: "Canst thou not risk and suffer that internally, which I suffered
   without measure in My body, in My Hands and Feet and in all My Body?"

   Children, some men cannot bear this; so they seek here, there and
   everywhere for rest; and find it not, till they cast themselves down
   into the depths of suffering. How, think ye, should death be met?
   Children, if a man were as pure as when first baptized, and had never
   fallen into sin, still, if he desired to attain to the next truth, he
   must pass through this earthquake, and by this way into true
   resignation, or he will get no further.

   After this earthquake came the fire; and in that the Lord came not.
   This means fiery love, which consumes the bones and the marrow, and by
   means of which a man is brought outside himself. A man was once so
   greatly inflamed by this fire that he never trusted himself to go near
   straw, thinking that his very heat must set it alight. Another man,
   because of this heat, could only sleep in winter when it had been
   snowing; he then lay down in the snow and slept, and the snow
   immediately melted around him, far and near. See, children, fiery love
   penetrates by the spirit into the body, and yet in this the Lord comes
   not.

   After this came a sweet, gentle breeze, a soft wind like a murmur; and
   in that came the Lord. How was it, think ye, that must be, when the
   Lord comes to man in all these ways which are sudden and violent, and
   which cause such great disturbances that all that there is in his poor
   nature and in his spirit is consumed, so that then the Lord Himself
   comes? Know this, that if God did not preserve man's nature in a
   supernatural manner, he would be unable, even if he had the strength of
   a hundred men, to bear the joy and the wonder; and yet it is only a
   glimpse. This glimpse was so excessively sudden that Elias stood in the
   door of the cave, and wrapped his face in his mantle. This cave is
   human weakness; but the entrance is nothing less than the vision of the
   Godhead by man. Elias wrapped his face in his mantle; which means that,
   however short and swift the vision was, still it was a glimpse that
   transcended nature, and was insupportable and incomprehensible to the
   natural man. Children, it was verily God the Lord Who was here. His
   sweetness is far above that of honey and the honey-comb, which are the
   sweetest things known to the world. But this reaches far beyond all
   powers, even unto a fathomless abyss. As weak eyes cannot bear the
   brightness of the sun, so a thousand times less can nature endure this
   condition in her weakness. All that we can say of this is that however
   well and fully we may be able to comprehend it with our minds, express
   it in words, or grasp it with the understanding, still it is all as
   utterly unlike the reality as it would be were I to say of a piece of
   black coal: "Look, here is the bright sun which lightens all the
   world." Here true peace is brought forth; that peace which passeth all
   understanding; and thus a man may here be established in that true
   peace, which no man taketh from him.

   Now the Form which Job saw and did not recognise, was the second Person
   of the Godhead, the Son of God; the soft, gentle Breeze in which the
   Lord came was the Holy Ghost. St Gregory says that this means that He
   came in this gentle breeze, and at Whitsuntide in a rushing wind. The
   reason was that He came to the outward man in a visible way, that he
   might carry on the work for the benefit of Christendom. Job needed it
   not after this fashion, therefore the Spirit came to him. Blessed are
   the sons of men who can attain to this great good for an instant even
   before death. But know that, however great and good this may be, it is
   as unlike all the sweetness that will be ours in Eternal Life, as the
   least drop of water is to the fathomless sea.

   Now, what becomes of all those men before whom this joy is held forth
   and made known? They sink down in their absolute nothingness, in an
   inscrutable manner, as though they desired to be annihilated for a
   hundred hours out of love and praise to Him. It would be joy to them in
   the Presence and in awe of that great Being, out of very love, to
   attain to a state of non-existence; and they would gladly cast
   themselves down into the deepest abyss; for the more they acknowledge
   His Majesty, the more they acknowledge their own littleness and
   worthlessness. By this annihilation they have so absolutely separated
   themselves from themselves, that even if God wished to give none of
   this consolation and this experience they would not desire it, but
   would flee from it. And, if of their own free will they desired none,
   it would not be good for them, and it might easily lead them into sin,
   for which they would afterwards have to suffer in purgatory; and it
   would also be a sign that all was not well with them. Therefore the
   power of love must ever be thirsting; while moderation and discretion
   flee away.

   These men have a most consuming thirst for suffering. They look upon it
   as their consolation and joy, given to them by God, that they may
   follow the blessed example of Christ. They desire to may come to them
   in the most ignominious and painful manner in which it can be borne.
   They thirst for the Cross; and, with love and fervent longings, they
   bend beneath the Cross of their beloved Lord. Here the Holy Cross is
   exalted indeed on the sacred Day of the Cross. The sufferings and the
   example of our Lord are followed here with true dignity. St Paul, who
   was exalted even unto the third heaven, said: "God forbid that I should
   glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." [22] Job said: "My
   soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones death." [23] This he chose
   as the best that God had given him. This hanging on the Cross is pain
   to most men, because their God hung on the Cross for their sakes,
   therefore God ordains that man should experience horrible darkness, and
   be forsaken in his great misery. How can the power of love, which was
   kindled by the flame of love, sustain itself when thus cut off from all
   consolation in such a perceptible way? Integrity and moderation come
   and speak to the power of love: "See, beloved one, this is the
   inheritance that He has left to those who love Him; a soul full of God
   and a body or nature full of suffering." As love burns more or less
   brightly, so this inheritance is ever more valued, and is sweeter than
   any other consolation could be. This is the longed-for inheritance that
   our Lord promised to His Friends by the Prophets. The more nobly they
   posses this inheritance and love it, the more they will also posses
   that blessed and heavenly inheritance that our Lord extolled to His
   friends. They will posses it ever in fuller measure throughout
   eternity. The holy Martyrs have attained to this inheritance by their
   great love. They think they are only just beginning life; they feel
   like men who are beginning to grow. May God have mercy on those who
   neglect this ever increasing, true and holy blessing for vile, corrupt
   things, and may we ever confess this to Him. Amen.

  SERMON XV

      On the Feast of St Mary Magdalene

   A most precious Sermon and thoughtful Exhortation, which covers the
   whole ground of the Teaching and Preaching of the celebrated Doctor
   Tauler. Of the true resignation and seclusion by which we may come to
   real peace and to the highest state of perfection. It is founded on the
   words of Christ which he spake, in praise of Mary Magdalene, to her
   sister Martha.

   "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and art troubled about many things.
   But one thing is necessary; Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall
   not be taken away from her."

   In our dear Lord Jesus Christ, and in His holy and fruitful Coming, I
   greet you, faithful children of God, who are assembled here to learn of
   the Divine Word, and of the best way to eternal salvation. Amen.

   Dearly beloved and elect, listen to the Voice of God in your hearts,
   earnestly and diligently, that ye may not be led astray and blinded by
   transitory things and your own natural tendencies. If ye heartily
   desire to become the dearest Friends and Disciples of our beloved Lord
   Jesus Christ, ye must rid yourselves of all that pertains to the
   creature, and especially free yourselves, as much as possible, of all
   that can be rightly and honestly called necessary. Ye must look to Him
   alone as the Source of all things, for He needs the help of none. Ye
   must keep yourselves cut off and freed from all superfluous and
   unnecessary conversation and outward delight in human beings, and from
   all images, both external and internal, that are pleasing in any way to
   the natural man, or of which ye are conscious. This ye must do, like
   the beloved Mary Magdalene; so that God may work His wonderful works in
   you, according to His dear Will, and may pour out upon you His fervent,
   ardent Love and Divine Grace, that ye may acknowledge, as ye fall at
   His Sacred Feet, that all that may befall you is needful and His Divine
   Decree.

   Now mark, if we were inwardly conscious of it, we should well
   understand, how very often we may be blinded, to our own hurt, by
   unnecessary and external works of love, which prevent our perceiving
   the divine inspiration and our own infirmities. Although such works may
   have been done in love, both great and godlike, and may not be really
   evil in themselves, still they are not that which is best and most
   perfect. Our Lord Jesus Christ praised Mary Magdalene for her absolute
   separation from all things, when He said: "She hath chosen the best
   part," [24] and He rebuked Martha, because she was too careful in her
   anxiety and great and loving service, for she loved Him and His chosen
   disciples, with ardent, fervent love; and that in itself was right and
   proper. Therefore, if we especially desire to receive from God
   consolation and teaching that will be useful to us and bear fruit in
   us, and a true and perfect separation from all needful things, both
   bodily and spiritual, it is very necessary that we should decide at
   once to cut ourselves off from all unnecessary works and ways, in our
   words, works and all things that are more than absolutely necessary,
   either in bodily or spiritual matters, following therein the teachings
   of God and of our own consciences. It is especially necessary that we
   should shun and flee from all those persons who desire to lead us
   astray, and suggest thoughts to us of outward things, however holy
   those persons may be, or may seem to be; for they are not our true
   friends in sincerity and truth, whether they be Father Confessors or
   whosoever they may be, either spiritually or worldly-minded people. We
   shall never find God anywhere so perfectly, so fruitfully and so truly
   as in retirement and in the wilderness; like the Blessed Mother of God,
   St John the Baptist, and Mary Magdalene, and other saints and
   patriarchs. They all fled from the world, from society, and all the
   cares and anxieties of the creature, and went into the forests and into
   the desert, or wherever they could find the greatest solitude. Oh!
   verily, much intercourse with society, and much outward conversation
   and necessary business lead up to an evil old age, and drive out God,
   however good the intentions may have been. For, when we fill our hearts
   with the creature, and with strange, useless images, God must of
   necessity remain outside, neither desires He to enter there. A barrel
   that has been filled with refuse or with decaying matter, cannot
   hereafter be used for good, generous wine or any other pure drink. Oh!
   verily, we may turn where and to whomsoever we will in this life, and,
   in all outward things, we shall find nothing but falsity,
   unfaithfulness and dissension. Where we imagine we shall be able to
   seek and to find great consolations and delight, we lose entirely all
   inward consolation, and are robbed entirely of that peace of mind which
   is had taken us a long time to attain in solitude. We cannot regain it,
   and we become greatly discontented, offending by unnecessary,
   superfluous and untrue words; we waste our time, and do many other
   things which cause our hearts to grow cold and extinguish our love.
   Conscious pricks us, and we are easily stirred up and urged on to
   impatience and anger. Woe be to us! could we only realise this, we
   should find that in God only can we have peace or consolation, or truly
   perfect joy and delight.

   Let us turn to God with all our hearts, and wait upon Him in meekness
   and patience, as did the holy Prophets and Patriarchs, aforetime, in
   the old Covenant (Testament); for they indeed waited patiently for His
   coming in Hades, for many thousand years before they were redeemed. Oh!
   surely, we ought to be more ready to wait for Him, when, for a time, He
   withdraws His consolation and sweetness, of which we are quite
   unworthy, and hides Himself from us. He thinks only of what is best and
   most useful for us, that He may kindle and stir up our love and our
   longing for Him, ever more and more. For in His love and great mercy He
   neither wills nor desires to refuse, or to take from us, anything that
   is useful and necessary either in body or spirit; He knows surely what
   is best for us.

   O God, how greatly we need Thy mercy! for we are so foolish and
   senseless, that we often allow little things to keep us back, imagining
   that we are pleasing God, when we sing His praise with many
   high-sounding words; though the words used by the Saviour and His dear
   disciples were short and simple. Or again, we think we are pleasing God
   and helping our neighbour by an unjustifiable waste of time and much
   outward sorrow. Or again, we think it is good and useful for us to
   carry on much unnecessary business and to delight in our fellow
   creatures (however holy they may be or appear to be). Thus even the
   blessed Form of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, and His faithful, fatherly
   and fruit-bringing Presence became harmful to His dear disciples and
   hindered them and led them astray, as He Himself said: "It is expedient
   for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not
   come unto you." Or again, we think we may have and hold many things
   with delight, and as our own, without spiritual harm; either temporal
   goods, company, familiar intercourse with relations or spiritual
   friends, while at the same time we are pleasing our dear Lord and
   continuing in His love; though He was despised, He was sorrowful and
   poor, and said Himself: "There is no man that hath left house, or
   brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
   lands for My sake, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this
   time, and in the world to come eternal life."

   He says also in another place: "He who hateth not his father and mother
   and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and his own life
   also, he cannot be My disciple."

   O God! could we but see into the depths of the loving teaching of our
   dear Lord, we should surely acknowledge at once that all our life is
   unholy, and that it is not at all that which we imaging it to be.

   If we ever are to attain to true Divine Peace, and be completely united
   to God, all that is not absolutely necessary, either bodily or
   spiritually, must be cast off; everything that could interpose itself
   to an unlawful extent between us and Him, and lead us astray; for He
   alone will be Lord in our hearts, and none other; for Divine Love can
   admit of no rival.

   Oh! let us praise the Death of our dear Lord Jesus Christ and his
   inestimable merit, and ponder on the short transitory nature of this
   miserable life, and the delusions of this faithless, treacherous and
   deceitful world. Remember how dangerous it is to hold intercourse with
   any, whether clergy or laity, and how short our time is here, and that
   we must be preparing for the day of our death which is ever drawing
   nearer. If ye keep watch over your hearts, and listen for the Voice of
   God and learn of Him, in one short hour ye can learn more from Him than
   ye could learn from man in a thousand years. Dear children, use this
   short but more precious time wisely and profitably; and let none cause
   you to err, neither deceive you, that ye may not, to your own hurt,
   neglect your own salvation. We may lose much of our worldly goods, but
   we may also recover them again, though they will be of no further use
   to us when this short fleeting life is over. But if we lose but one
   little hour of this precious time, or vainly waste it, we can never
   recover it again; and we shall be in need of it throughout eternity,
   and be deprived of the exceeding great and eternal joy and reward,
   which we might otherwise have earned.

   I fear, indeed, that there is great cause for anxiety, both on my
   account and on that of all those who cling too much to their
   fellow-creatures, and who are led astray and needlessly troubled by
   asking, hearing and talking too much about strange and useless tales.
   It comes to pass, too, that when, through His great and endless mercy,
   God preserves us from great and coarse sins, He nevertheless allows us
   to persist in fruitless outward imaginings, in a cold, thoughtless,
   foolish state of blindness, so that we neither can make, nor desire to
   make any progress towards a state of perfection, and shall have in
   consequence, to endure the fires of purgatory. We are like unto foolish
   asses, which never learn any form of speech than their own braying, or
   seek any other comfort or sweetness, but only rough, tasteless
   thistles, while they have to endure scorn and many a hard and cruel
   blow, which they really do not deserve. Surely, if we are not willing
   to give up outward attachments and distractions, simply for the sake of
   God and our own eternal salvation, yet we ought to be able to do so
   readily for the sake of that great peace of heart, which, even in this
   world, would be ours; and because we should be freed from much painful
   and unmerited oppression and perplexity. Verily, the man who wishes to
   prove himself always in the right, in everything that he does, sees,
   hears and discusses, and who will not give way and be silenced, will
   never be at peace in himself, and will have a barren, sullen and
   wandering mind; he will prey upon himself, even though he be left in
   peace by all, and is tried by no outward pressure. We must commend all
   that we posses both in body and spirit in full confidence to God, and
   allow Him to work in us according to His Will; and then we shall attain
   to perfect peace. He can guide and prepare us far better in all things,
   both bodily and spiritual, and for our own good both in body and
   spirit, if He finds that we have desired and sought honestly His praise
   and glory alone in all things. This indeed should suffice us; we need
   no longer be careful or troubled about anything, either without or
   within, but must seek only to give ourselves into His keeping entirely,
   in all humility. If it seem good to Him, He can show us in many ways
   what we ought to do and what we ought to leave undone; for He only
   knows what is really needful for us, and He only desires that which is
   best for us, would we but trust ourselves entirely to Him.

   But we want to order our own ways, and to do that which we think best,
   just as we fancy and it pleases us, perhaps solely in the light of
   nature. We want to be wiser than God, Who is the Source of all Wisdom,
   and we imagine that, could we but rid ourselves of this sorrow or of
   that person, or could we be at such and such a court or society, it
   would be to our profit and advantage. Truly, if we could but see it, we
   should find that the Evil Spirit willingly deceives us and leads our
   hearts astray, making us restless and discontented. Steadfastness is
   not only one of the sources, but also shares in all other virtues;
   therefore the Evil One always endeavours, whenever he gets a chance, to
   prevent men from holding fast to this virtue. But if we strove more
   diligently to find him out, we should realise that we are seeking
   secretly and ignorantly by the light of nature. We imagine things, and
   lie to ourselves and are ready to flee from the Cross, and to cast it
   away, before God sees fit to remove it. Verily, this should not and
   ought not so to be; for our dear Lord, in His great love and mercy
   towards His chosen ones, afflicts and crucifies them unceasingly in
   this world, in many secret, strange ways, often unknown to them. He
   would not have them love anything too well in this life, that evil
   spirits may never gain any power over them. Our dear Lord afflicts and
   crucifies one man in one way, and another man in another way; one more,
   another less, according to the needs of each, and of the power of each
   to receive the Grace of God, and to draw nearer to His own Will in all
   things. Therefore we must be ready to suffer and submit, as much in one
   kind of suffering and need as in another, just as God sees fit to
   afflict us. We must not think at once that if we could have some really
   divine witness or testimony from God, or from His Friends, that we then
   should be more at peace; for often, when we strive to avoid some slight
   suffering or discipline, we only fall into it all the more deeply.

   Woe be unto us! Were we only not so foolish, but recognised instead how
   very much the smallest suffering or affliction purifies us and unites
   us to God, and in God; how great our eternal reward will be; and how
   quickly it drives and chases away the Evil Spirit from us, so that he
   can have no power over us, surely, we should be ready to run miles to
   the Cross, and should earnestly thank all those who in any way
   afflicted or tried us. We should turn towards the road that they take
   from real joy and thankfulness, and we should be glad, beyond all
   measure, that we had been able to find and to carry so heavy a Cross.
   So did the holy Apostle, St Andrew; he rejoiced exceedingly in the
   Cross, and longed for it with fervent love and desire; because he
   craved in some measure to be like unto his God and Lord Who was
   crucified for our sakes. Oh! even in this life how great and enduring
   is the reward that we might gain, if we only yielded ourselves wholly
   and joyfully to the Will of God. Suffering and all kinds of affliction
   are indeed most precious and fruitful and make men so like Him, that
   our Lord will not leave any of His Friends without suffering. For,
   rather than that His chosen ones should be undisciplined and
   unprepared, He is ready to create suffering out of nothing, and allows
   them to be tried by all sorts of irrational and dishonest things that
   by means of them they may be prepared.

   But, alas! in these times, we are altogether unworthy of these fruitful
   gifts of God; we are careless and unreceptive. We protect ourselves
   from them, and struggle against them as much as lies in our power; for
   we will not suffer anyone to try us or to afflict us either by word or
   deed. When anyone attacks us, we fly at him at once, like angry dogs;
   we assert ourselves, and excuse ourselves in words, or in our own
   minds, by thinking that we were right or wrong, and that we ought not
   to allow ourselves to be oppressed in any way. Alas! why is our nature
   so untamed, so wild and unmortified; and why are we so foolish? We
   ought to think of suffering and affliction as necessary for us, though
   we are unworthy of them, and we should at all times thankfully and
   humbly receive the good gifts of God in silence, humility, meekness and
   patience, like that upright and steadfast Job. We should always feel
   that we are guilty and suffer justly, however unjustly we may have been
   treated according to our own view; neither ought we to justify
   ourselves. Thus we may attain to true Divine Peace and stir up our
   fellowmen to all virtues. This would be more praiseworthy and
   well-pleasing unto God, than any outward discipline that we could
   devise or carry out for ourselves.

   Know this, dear children, that if all our teachers were buried, and all
   our books were burned, we should still find enough teaching and
   contrast to ourselves in the Life and Example of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   wherever we might need it, if we only diligently and earnestly learn
   how He went before, in silent patience, in gentleness, in adversity, in
   temptations of the Evil One, in resignation, in scorn, in poverty, and
   in all manner of bitter suffering and pain. Surely, if we oftener
   examined ourselves in this most useful and salutary Mirror, we should
   more readily and joyfully suffer affliction and adversity, and be
   better able to overcome and resist temptations and evil suggestions, in
   whatever way they attacked us or encountered us. All suffering and all
   work would be much lighter and easier to suffer and to bear, and then
   all the things that we see and hear would tend only to our good.

   For, if we wish to attain to great and fruitful peace in God, in
   nature, but not of this world, we must first diligently and earnestly
   learn to make the best of all things, and to endure, kindly and meekly,
   the behaviour of all kinds of men, their ways and customs; for they
   will often try and afflict us. The behaviour of other men and their
   ways will often vex and displease us; it will seem to us as though one
   person talked too much, another too little; one was too indolent,
   another too energetic; one erring in one way, another in another.
   Customs and fashions are so many and so various, that they assail us in
   many secret and unsuspected ways. We must learn to withstand them all
   vigorously, that they may take no root in us. By reason of weakness we
   cannot always keep our hearts free; yet we can at least vigorously
   check any outbreak in words, so that we shall neither condemn nor judge
   others, nor talk much of the lives and doings of others, either openly
   or in secret, however much we may be tempted. By acting thus we shall
   be great gainers; we shall be much less likely to break out; for we
   shall be more inclined to peace and kindliness, and be better able to
   endure. Our dear Lord Jesus Christ set us an example by so gently and
   meekly suffering the traitor Judas, and all those who hated Him, to
   remain near Him, although He knew all the hatred and unfaithfulness
   that they bore towards Him, and for which He, Who was Himself without
   guilt and sin, might justly have punished them. No one in this world is
   so perfect that if he were to examine his own heart, he would not find
   sin enough of which to rid himself, so that he would not be able justly
   to reprove others.

   Therefore, dear children, learn from my weaknesses to know your own,
   and rid yourselves of them. Take all my words, not my works, as from
   God; for I have studied them all in the book of my transgressions; take
   them earnestly to heart as a gentle warning and exhortation, not as an
   instruction; for I know that I need really to be taught by you and all
   men. He who does not occupy himself at home with a collected mind and
   pure heart in true humility cannot withstand temptation vigorously, nor
   acknowledge truth in all sincerity. Voluntary poverty is better than
   all the goods of this world, and union with God than heaven and earth
   full of blessings given by the command of God. May the everlasting
   peace of God be with you throughout all time and eternity. Amen.

  SERMON XVI

      On the Feast of the Holy Martyr, St Laurence

   Who, the true Servants of God are, who serve Him in truth, and follow
   Him, however, and wherever, He may lead them. Of the causes of
   wandering thoughts and a discontented mind on account of outward
   things. How a man in the service of God ought to be assured of his
   entrance into Eternal Life, and not only to presume it. How he should
   train himself in this life, that he may gain more knowledge and draw
   ever nearer.

   Qui mihi ministrat, me sequatur.

   "If any man minister to me, let him follow me."

   These words are full of truth and instruction. They make known to us
   simply who the true servants of God are, who serve God and follow Him
   in truth, and how and whither He leads them. God does not lead all His
   servants by one road, nor in one way, nor at one time; for God is in
   all things; and that man is not serving God aright, who can only serve
   Him in his own self-chosen way. If such men do not follow their usual
   course, they can do nothing properly; and when God would lead them by
   another way, they turn back, and waste their affections on the things
   which surround them. They are not the servants of God, for they turn
   away from God, Whom alone they ought to serve, at all times, in all
   places, and by all their actions. Because God is in all things, and
   they do not in all things serve Him solely and entirely, and do not set
   Him truly and sincerely before them, they fritter away their
   opportunities, and are discontented with all their works and ways, with
   all men and with all places.

   What is the cause of this distraction and discontent? The first cause
   is that God has not entered into thy heart, and is not rooted there;
   and thou hast, instead, thought out for thyself and made thee a God,
   whom thou desirest to have in thy being, but who does not exist.
   Therefore, when thy imagination departs, the presence of God fails
   thee. The second cause is that man devotes himself and clings to things
   which are apparent to the senses. He who desires to keep himself
   unspotted, must let all outward visible things pass by, and must force
   his way on, as through things that he heeds not, while he makes use of
   nothing that is not absolutely needful for the present time. But, if
   even then he finds there is anything that he does not need, he must
   keep away from it, and give neither time nor place to any being that is
   not in God. He does rightly, who acts as though he said: "I think of, I
   seek for, and I follow after, God only." He should greet all those whom
   he meets, and bless God, going on his own way; for what could be more
   like hell or the Devil to him, than want of love for Him Whom all
   creatures long for? Man should press onwards, with all his might,
   through all obstacles, overcoming them in God. He must not trouble
   himself too much about anything that detains him, either love or
   sorrow; and he must not repeat what does not concern him; that God may
   manifest Himself to him in all things, and that he may remain
   undisturbed in his own mind. Man can only do this by setting his
   affections on God alone, and on nothing else.

   But if, against thy will, anything which is not solely of God as thou
   art aware of it, bestir thyself, and turn thy ship round with the
   rudder of discretion. When the servant of God acts in this way, however
   much that is distracting may enter into his works and ways, most
   certainly he will neither be confused nor led astray. Even if he be not
   conscious of the Presence of God within him, yet God is undoubtedly
   there; so that, if neither sin nor the creature banish Him, the man
   will not be disturbed by any works or unexpected events. But if his
   works and ways rob him of his peace, he will, of a truth, find out for
   himself, or from others, that the true foundation is wanting, or has
   been destroyed; his works have not been done aright, and all his
   actions have not been truly centred in God. But if the man finds that
   God is not within him, he must feel after Him with all his might, that
   he may find Him; and he must put away all that might cause him to err,
   whatever it may be, or however it may be called. He will be, otherwise,
   like a man who has a dart in his body which he cannot pull out without
   giving himself pain; and who, if he does not pull it out, will have to
   suffer still greater pain and distress.

   Verily, if anything else is clearer to thee than God alone, or of which
   He is not the true Source, it must find no place in thee. If thou canst
   not bear the first suffering, whatever it may be, then greater
   suffering will follow; and then woe after woe will come, even more than
   man can conceive. Thy mind must be empty of all else, pure and seeking
   God only, filled only with Him, and with nothing else, as though thou
   wert ready to say: "Dear Lord, could I but only show Thee some measure
   of love in all places, and in the sight of all men, I would set myself
   to do it in all humility." But, if man is inclined to choose that which
   is next to God, let him strive to gain love, choose flight from all
   distractions, and, diligently and with all his might, turn his thoughts
   within. Man must serve God in all things, both outwardly and inwardly,
   and in all his actions, not according to his own will, but according to
   God's dear Will. For if a man has not God in his heart, he walks
   uncertainly and insecurely; as the Holy Scriptures say: "Woe to him
   that is alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up." [25]
   That man is indeed alone who has not God always within him, in his
   heart and in all his ways. But if he were first of all to take refuge
   with our Lord, then his castle, that is, his heart and soul, would be
   well garrisoned and protected, and his enemies would be unable to
   prevail against him. The man who lays hold on God, and desires Him
   only, will find that He is all-sufficient. All things will be but the
   road to God for him; and, content with whatever may come, he will
   attain to peace with himself and all mankind.

   Thus those men, to whom in truth God is present everywhere, will make
   greater progress, and attain all virtues more quickly than when there
   is greater equality. For when men stand on the same level, they must
   keep diligent watch over their own minds, and must examine closely how
   they respond in all their actions, their love and sorrow. But, when men
   are unequal, it is not so; them it comes to pass of itself, through
   man's depravity and subjection; and, in this response of inequality,
   man will surely become conscious whether he be really the faithful
   servant of God. If it should come to pass that the man himself should
   fail, he would not remain long in that condition; but, laying the blame
   on his own littleness and worthlessness, he would quickly turn gain in
   all humility to God, his true Foundation. Should he linger long in his
   failing, and want to find out how he came to give way, and whether he
   ought to have done this or that, he would only be held back the longer
   by unrighteousness. If thou desirest to be safe, turn at once in thy
   emptiness to God. If thou hast been inconsistent again than in God
   only? How canst thou better escape death than by the true, real Life,
   which is God Himself? Where can a man warm himself better than by the
   fire? So it is in God. Man must bring all that concerns him to God, and
   leave all with Him. God will provide for him in the best of ways. He
   must trust all things to God; and, in that trust, he must be ready to
   accept all things, as for the best, and rest in peace.

   But if man will not fully cast himself on God, and trust in Him, but
   wants to busy himself about everything and is full of care, God often
   lets him fall into misery and distress, that he may see how far he can
   get in his own strength. But if he trusts himself to God in all things
   in full confidence, then most certainly God will provide for him, both
   outwardly and inwardly, far better than any creature could. For God is
   full of grace and truth; and whatever we ask of Him, in full
   confidence, we shall assuredly receive; for just as it is impossible
   for us to love God too well, so also it is impossible for us to trust
   Him too much, if otherwise our intentions are right and good. This true
   peace is found by man in the depths of his own heart, which is the true
   Dwelling-place of God. When he first turns to God, he must needs be
   empty, he must have leisure, time and place for Him. There, in the
   innermost heart of man, this tree will grow up, with all its branches
   and fruits. For within, emptied of all else, ways and means of coming
   to God will be revealed to man; and he will also learn to understand
   God's dealings with him; the more he yields himself to this knowledge,
   the more clearly will God's ways be made known unto him.

   When a man finds that in himself, or in other men, this is wanting, he
   must understand that the way thereto has been destroyed, so that
   neither time, place nor leisure has been given to God, and that
   assuredly he has not sought this knowledge from within.

   Know, that such men depend all their lives long on the appearance of
   spirituality in their own actions; while all the time they know not
   themselves, and never find themselves in God; they let that alone. They
   make themselves believe that they are resigned, whereas they are
   showing criminal heedlessness; then other things come to pass which rob
   God of His rightful place; they fill it with themselves, or else with
   something belonging to them. It is just as impossible for man to posses
   God without love, as it is impossible that a man can exist without a
   soul, whether he be conscious of it or not. Thus a man goes on blindly
   and fearlessly, trusting to his appearance of spirituality, or to the
   good works that he does, avoiding self-examination, and imagining that
   he has taken the right road. When such a man comes to his end, he finds
   that it is eternal death; for he did not go by that Way which is Christ
   Himself, who has said: "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life." He
   who goeth not by that Way, goeth astray. It is indeed a disgrace, and a
   great crime, that a man learns and knows about so many other things
   while he neither knows, nor wishes to know himself.

   Dear children, no one ought to allow himself to be in doubt of his own
   eternal life; he ought to be sure of it, and not only imagine it. That
   to be sure of it, and not only imagine it. That is, he ought to know
   whether he has God within him, in his heart; and, on the other hand,
   whether he really longs for God. If he does not posses this true
   knowledge, then let him seek it of wise and holy men, that he may know,
   for certain, and not only imagine how things are with him. All the
   Saints, as well as the Virgin Mary, and all creatures, could not win
   for such a man, even with tears of blood, one moment more from God than
   he had deserved in this present life. Those who were ready went in
   joyfully to the marriage with the Bridegroom; while to those who were
   not ready, but who wanted to prepare themselves, He said with an oath:
   "Amen, I say to you, I know you not." Where was it that He knew as His
   own in the Kingdom of Heaven, and who stand in His Presence before His
   Face; He knew them not amongst those heavenly hosts; for they came too
   late. However loudly they knocked, yet the Lord opened not the door
   unto them.

   St Augustine says: "Nothing is so certain as death, and nothing is so
   uncertain as the hour of death." For, wherever and however it may come,
   of the time and the hour knoweth no man. Therefore nothing can be more
   necessary than that we should be ready at all times, and that we should
   know that we are, and not only hope so. We have been placed in this
   life, not only to do the works, but also that we may know, so that our
   works may grow out of knowledge, as fruit grows out of the tree.
   Therefore our work in this life is to gain more knowledge, and so to
   come nearer to God. He who has forced his way through, and who,
   according to the Will of God, can lift up his mind above this world,
   and who has ordered his life and his secret thoughts aright, will not
   be confused, distracted or hindered by the things that pertain to this
   life; but they will only serve to drive him to God. Therefore, if a
   man's mind and inward inclinations are steadfastly fixed on God with
   pure intentions, and his ways are ordered in peace, while he remains
   undisturbed in all good works, it is a sure sign that he is a righteous
   man, and that all his works are pure and true. This he seems to desire
   earnestly at all times; for he is like a corpse buried in the ground,
   that his soul may be buried in the depths of the Godhead. We have been
   placed in this world for this reason, and for none other. Whatever we
   neglect here will be lost to us for all eternity. To him whose
   superscription is on the penny, will the penny most certainly be given.
   Therefore every man should often search out his own heart, and seek
   diligently till he find whose superscription is there; what it is that
   he most loves and thinks of, whether it is God, or himself, or created
   beings, either living or dead. That which most fills his mind, his
   heart and his soul; that to which he most joyfully responds, whether
   from without or from within, will claim the penny with the
   superscription, and will receive it without any questioning. The man
   who searches out these things with real care, will assuredly learn to
   whom he belongs; it will not only be guess-work. For, if in thy heart
   thou thinkest of and lovest something which is not truly and only of
   God, and of which He is not the Source, but thou thyself; whatever it
   is, and however small, if thou knowingly and intentionally allowest it
   to remain in thee, God will never truly dwell in thee. Even thou wert
   to weep as many tears as there are drops in the ocean, it would be of
   no avail; thou wilt lack His Presence as long as eternity lasts.

   O, children! what are poor men about, when, having eyes that see, they
   allow themselves to be blinded by the creature, and will not guard
   against their own deceitful nature, which is so secretly absorbed with
   itself and with other things. Therefore examine your own minds, both
   outwardly and inwardly; desire God only; give Him free, empty and
   untroubled hearts, in which ye truly have no place yourselves, that He
   may work His noble work in you, and that He and none other may find a
   place there. May God help us to keep ourselves thus empty and free.
   Amen.

  SERMON XVII

      Of the Assumption of our Lady

   That we ought not to rest with delight in any earthly or spiritual
   things, but only in our unknown God. How we ought to dwell in the
   Divine Inheritance, so that we may attain to that which is Eternal; or
   how we ought to share, with love and thankfulness, in the sufferings
   and life of our Lord in this life, that we may attain to the Glorified
   Inheritance of His precious Godhead.

   In omnibus requiem quaesivi, et in haereditate Domini morabor.

   "In all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of
   the Lord."

   The wise man spake these words, and we interpret them of our dear Lady,
   who well might say: "In all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in
   the inheritance of the Lord."

   These words may not be most suitably used of our dear Lady, for in mind
   she soared above the heavens, into the very depths of hell, into the
   deep sea and over the whole surface of the globe, and yet found no
   rest. No one in this life should strive to soar so high, but every one
   should fix an hour every day, at which he should offer unto our Lady
   special service and praise, and beseech her earnestly to guide us, draw
   us and help us in coming to her dearly-beloved Child; for her worth
   transcends all estimation and measure.

   What a marvel it is that she should have laid her Creator and her God
   in her bosom; loving Him intensely above all imagining; and yet that
   she should never have doubted, but was always certain, that He was her
   God. She could behave to Him as His Mother, and He walked with her as
   her Child; and yet, never for one moment in all her life was she
   content with this; but in mind she soared ever above, and was lost in
   the Divine Abyss, in which alone she found her rest, her inheritance
   and her dwelling-place.

   Children, the poison of the first Fall has sunk into the very depths of
   our nature. We have been made and placed between the two ends; time and
   Eternity. Time for us ought to be nothing more than a passage to the
   end; and Eternity should be our aim and our dwelling place. Now poor
   man, unhappily, because of his fallen nature and his blindness, is
   attacked by everything on his weakest side; he rests himself by the way
   and forgets his true destiny. His nature clings to everything with
   which it comes into contact; it clutches at whatever it may be, and
   seeks rest therein, either bodily or spiritual, internal or external.
   It is quite apparent how worldly men seek their rest and pleasure; and
   they will surely find out hereafter how things stand with them. But
   those who hide worldly hearts under a spiritual appearance, and find
   rest in temporal things, whoever they may be, and whatever may be the
   cares which oppress them, would find, if they only knew it, what would
   make their hearts shrivel up in terror. God made all things that are
   needful, not for our satisfaction or pleasure, but for Himself alone.

   Children, I should be quite misunderstood were I to be supposed to have
   said: "I will not hear anyone's confession unless he promises to do
   what I want." It would be very wrong to say, "what I want." I require
   nothing from any one beyond that which is written; and I beg that no
   one will make me this promise. I can absolve no one that is not sorry
   for his sins, neither can the Pope himself, unless the man desires to
   amend his life and to guard against sin, and also against the causes of
   sin, as much as lies in his power. Some men cling willingly and
   consciously to the causes of sin, and then go to confession and receive
   the Lord's Body, while they will not acknowledge their sin. Because
   they do not steal and are not unchaste they go on as they are. They
   must judge for themselves how they an be absolved; they must find out,
   indeed, what repentance and sorrow there can be, when they thus look
   for rest and peace, while seeking for satisfaction, apart from God,
   either in their fellow-creatures, in clothes, in food or in creature
   comforts. Such men also seek for peace in spiritual matters and in
   things which look good; when such men have done anything wrong, they
   hurry off to make an outward confession, before they have confessed to
   God in their hearts, and have humbly pleaded guilty. They seek for
   natural repose in this outward confession, that they may get peace, and
   that the blame and reproofs of their own consciences may be stilled and
   silenced; for, when men have confessed, their minds are at ease and
   they are content. Confession and rebuke are like a fresh wound; they
   rub and scrub away the blight of sin.

   Now, nature also seeks for rest in spiritual exercises. Some men hold
   so fast to their inner works and ways, to their exercises and secret
   discipline, that these good things lead them to wander from the Lord to
   lesser truths. In short, all in which man seeks for rest, and which is
   not wholly in God, is corrupt, however good it may be or seem to be,
   whether without form, or void, or senseless, or endowed with sense and
   usefulness. All that man rests in with delight, and possesses, is
   corrupt. Seek only for simple immersion in that bare, single, unknown,
   unnamed secret Good, which is God, denying self and all that may be
   found in self. As St Dionysius says: "God is not only that which thou
   canst receive of Him. He is above all wisdom, above all beings, above
   all goodness, above all that thou canst receive or know of Him. He is
   more than and higher than anything that man's understanding can
   conceive; higher and yet lower, more and yet more, and far above all
   things." Seek thy rest in this unknown God, but expect neither taste
   nor sight. Act like a dog, which comes and finds a good piece of meat;
   though he dares not touch it, and flees; for he is so used to hard
   blows. Hereafter thou wilt find that thus it really is; only bear
   thyself humbly in thy absolute nothingness, which is verily thy true
   condition. If anything is there, it is His, not thine; and turn not
   aside to all that seems plain to thee; though it be without form or
   sense, and is supernatural. Men say: "It is all real to me; and this
   proves that it is God." Dear child, turn not there for rest; let it
   alone, whatever it may be; ask no more, but keep thyself under; sink
   beneath thine ignorance, neither desire to know. Keep thyself poor in
   thy hidden unknown God; and believe that thou art not the man who could
   in any way understand the great, unknown and hidden God. Rest in Him,
   and dwell in Him, and not in tasting and seeing.

   It is written in the prophet Ezekiel: "The men that go into the
   sanctuary...shall have no inheritance; I am their inheritance."
   Although this refers primarily to the priesthood, yet in a spiritual
   sense it refers to all men who desire to enter into the Holy of Holies,
   that is unto the secret Mystery of God. They are to have no
   inheritance, because the Divine, unknown, nameless, secret Being of God
   shall be their inheritance. They shall not bow their heads before
   anything else, either external or internal, or it will become corrupt.
   Turn not to it as though all were bad. Take that which is rough and
   uneven, rather than tasting and feeling. My dear child, rest not, seek
   not that which is thine own. As God chose to create and to make all
   things, before Him there was nothing but nothing. He did not make all
   things out of something, but out of nothing. When God chooses to work
   alone, He needs nothing but nothing. That which is nothing is more
   receptive of His works than that which is something. If thou desirest
   to be unceasingly susceptible of all that God may give, may work in and
   desire to see in the life and being of His most chosen Friends; and if
   thou desirest, especially, that He may pour out upon thee all His
   gifts; see to it, above all things, that in truth, in the very depths
   of thy heart, thou art nothing; for our self-assertion and
   self-pleasing hinder the work of God in us. The holy Job was praised by
   our Lord, Who said that he was upright, and perfect, and that his equal
   was not to be found, and that he had never spoken a foolish word; and
   yet Job said: "All that I have shall go down into the deepest pit."

   This holy man did not mean by this to refer to himself, and all that
   belonged to him, as created out of nothing, because man has no part in
   this; but he referred to himself, and all who belonged to him, who had
   come to nought, through their sins. This righteous man desired on
   account of his guilt to descend into the very lowest depths of the
   abyss, into the greatest suffering and deepest darkness of hell, as
   though he were speaking wisely either of his sins, or of the guilt that
   he had incurred, as though it were possible to do enough; he desired to
   suffer the severest and sharpest pain, and never to escape from it,
   till he had given satisfaction for this load of guilt.

   One of our brethren, named Wigmann, spake in like manner. He was so
   conscious of his own nothingness that he could find no place for
   himself but in the lowest depths of hell, in the domains of Lucifer. As
   he lay there, he heard a voice calling from the highest heavens, which
   said: "Wigmann, come up to the highest Throne, the Father's Heart."
   Gregory says, that these men seek death and find it not. This love in
   fathomless annihilation answers to the life in truth, unsought,
   undesired, unintended; for the lower, the higher, and the less, the
   more.

   Now let us take these words of our dear Lady. "I shall abide in the
   inheritance of the Lord." There are two inheritances in which we ought
   to live. One is temporal, a worthy life with suffering in the Likeness
   of our Lord. The other inheritance, that for which we wait, is the
   glorified inheritance of the Blessed Godhead; the promise is made unto
   us that we shall be joint-heirs with Him, and members of His household
   throughout eternity. If we possess this temporal inheritance in faith,
   love, and thankfulness (even the Sufferings and Life of our Lord), in
   the same measure, in which we have disciplined ourselves, shall we also
   possess the Eternal Inheritance,--only more richly and blessedly.

   The wounds of our Lord are all healed, except the Five Wounds, which
   will remain open until the Judgment Day; the Brightness of the Godhead
   which shines forth from them, and the blessedness which the Saints and
   Angels receive from them, is inexpressible. These five Doors should be
   our inheritance here; and we must enter through them into our Eternal
   Inheritance, our Fatherland. The Holy Ghost is the Porter, the
   Door-keeper of these doors. His dear love is ever ready to open unto us
   when we knock, and to let us in, that we may enter through them into
   the Inheritance of the Father; and, assuredly, no man can go astray who
   enters thereby.

   These Five Wounds should teach us five lessons, which will guide us to
   all remedies; they are Suffering, Silence, Abstinence, Contempt and
   Self-denial in true resignation. Fall down before the left Foot, and
   draw from it strength to avoid all the pleasures and gratifications
   that thou hast, or desirest to have, apart from Him. Then immerse
   thyself with all thy power in the wound in the right Foot, and learn to
   suffer whatever may come upon thee, either from within or from without,
   and from whatever cause. Then draw sweetness from the right Hand, and
   beseech God to enable thee to keep silence, both outwardly and
   inwardly. No evil can ever befall him who possess these virtues, and
   keeps silence about all things. Then draw from the left Hand strength
   to despise all temporal things, both outwardly and inwardly, and all
   the changes and chances that thou lovest and carest for in spite of
   Him. Then flee, with all that thou hast, to His dear Heart that He has
   opened for His great Love; and then shall they receive of His
   eternally. Then man must learn to be ever denying himself in all ways;
   in love and sorrow, in possession and in want, in time and in eternity,
   as the Lord wills, and as it pleases Him that it shall come to pass in
   thee and in all creatures.

   Thus, and in many holy meditations, ye must exercise yourselves in this
   blissful inheritance, and enter into this Eternal Inheritance by this
   safe Gate. Offer His guiltless Suffering to the Heavenly Father for
   your guilty suffering, His guiltless Thoughts for your guilty ones, and
   His Holy Word for your guilty words; and in like manner all His
   Actions, His Humility, His Patience, His Meekness and His Love, for all
   that is wanting in you, both without and within. If you thus possess
   this inheritance here with Him, the future inheritance is assured to
   you, that ye may dwell and rest for ever in the Inheritance of the
   Lord. Amen.

  SERMON XVIII

      On the Feast of St Augustine

   How man should keep strict watch and guard over all his life and his
   discipline. How wonderfully God exalts those who truly wait for Him,
   far above all temporal things; and then, for their good, smites and
   humbles them with all manner of troubles and temptations, that they may
   be driven and helped along the safest road to everlasting Salvation.

   Vigilate, quia nescitis, qua hora Dominus vester venturus sit.

   "Watch ye therefore, because you know not what hour your Lord will
   come."

   St Augustine says: "Ye must be watching, for ye know not when the Lord
   will be coming to the marriage.

   The Enemy exerts all his cunning and dexterity unceasingly that he may
   destroy us everlastingly. He is always looking out to find an hour or a
   moment, when we are not diligent in our meditations, and have forgotten
   a window open in our imaginations, and are not standing on our guard;
   then he creeps in at once and steals all our goods. Therefore guard
   your windows, and watch, that he may not undermine your house like a
   thief; therefore watch unceasingly with all thy strength and with a
   collected mind. For as soon as a man gives place to pride, and is
   well-pleased with himself, and becomes presumptuous and self-willed,
   the Enemy is immediately on the spot, and robs him of his purse of good
   works. Children, what will ye see and find after this life in those who
   have been famed for austerity and good works, and who have had great
   names, and have made a great show, but whose self-satisfaction and love
   of ease have deprived them so entirely of all, that they will be
   thankful to be placed amongst the peasants, amongst unlearned and
   inexperienced men. And some poor, simple men, held in esteem by none,
   will, on account of their humble and oppressed condition, stand so high
   above them. Therefore, watch with brave hearts and open eyes, and see
   the plain truth, without any distinctions in thought, words, works, and
   deeds, in all actions, in virtuous deeds, in patient suffering; and
   examine yourselves both outwardly and inwardly.

   Children, ye know not in what danger ye stand, on account of your
   natural weakness, your terribly wicked sins, and on account of the
   great and unsurpassable good that we might receive clear Divine Eyes
   search us through and through; while man, so full of impurity, stands
   before Him, and all that is not purified of that which is not of God in
   truth, is spread out before the Face of God.

   How deeply we shall feel our shame! and how surely all will be judged!
   It is written: "And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where
   shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" St Augustine says: "Woe be to
   all in unrighteousness, if God will not judge them according unto
   mercy." Therefore, if ye could only know in what danger all stand, who
   desire something else than God, your human minds would be unable to
   bear it. The holy Job said: "How long wilt Thou not spare me, nor
   suffer me to swallow down my spittle? I have sinned; what shall I do to
   Thee, O Keeper of men? why hast Thou set me opposite to Thee?"

   Then in the Gospel we read: "Watch therefore; let your loins be girt,
   and lamps burning in your hands, and you yourselves like to men who
   wait for their Lord, when he shall return from the wedding." [26] Ye
   have heard of this watching.

   Now ye must notice three points here. First, your loins must be girded
   and bound round as with a cord, so that ye can be drawn and guided
   against your will, like a horse which is bridled, and can be held up
   when about to fall. The loins are sensual pleasures, which must be
   bound, and tamed, and girded up, and never allowed their liberty. The
   second point is, that ye must have burning torches in your hands; that
   is, the sweet reality of true, fervent love, both within and without.
   Ye must, as far as possible, never let it pass out of your hands; and
   ye must especially meditate on it, one with another, according to your
   power. The third point is, that ye must wait for your Lord till He
   comes from the wedding. "Blessed are those servants whom the Lord, when
   He cometh, shall find watching." He will set them over all His goods,
   and gird Himself and serve them.

   This marriage, from which the Lord comes, is in the very innermost
   parts of the soul, where the Image of God is. The nearness of the soul
   to God, and of God to the soul, the wonderful works God does there, and
   the joy and delight which God does there, are beyond all reason and
   understanding; although man himself knows nothing and feels nothing
   thereof. But the men, in whom God thus rejoices, and with whom He thus
   unites Himself, are the men who have turned with all their hearts and
   all their desires to God, away from the world and all creatures, and
   who ever desire to live only unto Him. But He will have nothing to do
   with the men who devote themselves with all their hearts to their own
   concerns, whether living or dead.

   Now, if the Lord tarries too long, these men who are waiting are seen
   by the Enemy, and he comes and suggests some desire to them, either
   from without or from within, so that they may rest therein. Give no
   heed to him; remain on thy guard. Blessed are those servants who wait,
   for they know not when the Lord will come, whether it will be in the
   first, the second or the third watch of the night. Then He will wait on
   them, and serve them, and allow them to be conscious of a foretaste of
   the hidden Union; and thus He will strengthen them that waiting may not
   be too hard for them. He gives them, in that which they experience, the
   sweetness of His Love, that their love may be strangthened thereby. Now
   St Gregory takes up the words of the Psalter and says: "I have gone far
   away in flight; and I abode in the wilderness." When the inner man has
   thus waited and waited, he must go away, fly from all things, and
   remain in solitude. This solitude if formed not only by a man giving up
   all the external distractions of his outward faculties, but also the
   inner distractions of his inner powers. These are the powers of
   imagination, in pictures and phantasies, and in thoughts, so that man
   turns away from all forms and fancies, and dwells in solitude; and,
   when he has overcome this affliction and has endured, then the Lord,
   for Whom he has been waiting, comes in a moment, and with one glance
   exalts him above all things, and delights him after his long waiting.
   Then He strikes him down again, and oppresses him, that he may not be
   overmuch exalted by his experience.

   Jeremias, the prophet, says of such an one: "I sat not in the assembly
   of jesters, nor did I make a boast of the Presence of Thy Hand; I sat
   alone, because Thou hast filled me with threats;" as though he had been
   threatened with both fists.

   The first fist, with which he is threatened, is a darkness which comes
   over him from within, while he is led by a dark and miserable road. He
   knows nothing, and he has nothing, and he is attached, besides, by all
   kinds of misfortunes, sins and temptations; by pride, uncleanness,
   unbelief and many other temptations, of which he thought he had long
   been freed, and which he imagines he had overcome; they threaten him
   and cause him great fear. The other fist which threatens him is, that
   God holds up His terrible judgments before him, so that the man feels
   that his only rightful place is in the lowest depths of hell. There two
   fists keep him down wonderfully, and God desires by all these
   threatenings to root out the evil, poisonous growth of pride. All
   desires are more quickly extinguished in those who rightly understand
   these fists, than they could be by much external discipline lasting for
   many years.

   Now, when man goes in with the prophet, and wishes to dwell with him,
   and he finds that all storms, thoughts, imaginations and figures are
   stilled within him, then God and the holy Angels come, and suddenly, in
   a moment, real love is given to him, so that he perceives something
   that he is to do for Holy Christendom, or for the dead or the living;
   it flashes upon him in an instant. Then the Enemy also comes, and looks
   about to see whether he also can find his own here. He makes an attack,
   and, adding thereto suffering and thoughts, casts them before the man.
   But he must not heed them, he must let them pass by him; for if he does
   not love nor desire them, the Enemy will have to go his own way,
   ashamed and empty-handed, and the man will be greatly furthered by this
   attack.

   In some lands men may be found who cultivate false poverty, lay aside
   all work, and protect themselves from all good thoughts, saying they
   have attained to peace; they will not exercise themselves in deeds of
   virtue, for they say they have got beyond them. These men have a devil
   by their side who hinders all that can destroy their peace, either from
   without or from within, either in thought or in other ways of that
   kind, that they may remain at peace, so that hereafter he may take them
   with him into the eternal dissensions of his hell; and, for this he
   preserves them in their false peace. The righteous do not take this
   false method, but exercise themselves both outwardly and inwardly, and
   endure in all the ways by which the Lord leads them, which He
   predestined, and in darkness; and they do not presume that they have
   attained unto peace. They are not disquieted, because they walk in a
   narrow path, between peace and disquiet, between hope and unrighteous
   fear, between safety and doubt. And, when true peace, liberty of mind
   and safety, reveal themselves to them, they at once cast them down to
   the ground, and do not cling to them. Men who desire to walk in this
   narrow path must see above all things that they plant their feet firmly
   in the Footsteps of our Lord Jesus Christ; the firmer they stand
   therein, the purer will they become. Then these threatening fists are
   transformed into good and loving hands; our Lord receives them tenderly
   in His Fatherly Arms, and leads them up far above all things. Then all
   natural things fall away from them, and only those things trouble them
   which are not of God. And now the Lord shows them the dark, difficult
   ways, and the narrow paths over which they have come; none can harm
   them any more, and they rejoice over all their sufferings.

   This is spoken, in truth, against those free spirits who glory in their
   false liberty, and who, in false poverty boast of their false peace,
   taking their stand on their own works and ways of forty years and more,
   and on the great deeds that they have done. Such men will not walk in
   the narrow path. In a great community there may be scarcely one or two
   men who desire to walk in this way. All the others who are there hem
   them in and attack them, and cause them trouble; and then, when they
   act wrongly, they speak hardly to them and say: "Thou must suffer for
   it!" but if a severe answer or unkind words escape thee, come to
   thyself at once, and acknowledge thy transgression and be sorry for thy
   sin. Be silent, endure, and accept all as from God, that thou mayest
   learn to know thyself thereby. If thou hadst shown more patience, thou
   mightest have attained to a noble mind. Therefore humble thyself and go
   forwards. All will be prepared for thee, whether crooked or straight;
   all will be for thy good, if only thou wilt realise it and be valiant.
   Therefore, he who thus waits on the Lord with watchful eyes, as St
   Augustine did, him will the Lord serve, and to him will He impart
   perfect joy, as He did to St Augustine. May God help us thereto. Amen.

  SERMON XIX

      On the Nativity of Our Lady

   How the strange birth of temporal things, such as delight in the
   creature, hinders the Divine Birth in man; and how, if God is to be
   born in us, the clinging to old, evil habits must be broken off.

   Transite ad me omnes, qui concupiscitis me.

   "Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits."

   To-day we celebrate the nuptial day on which the Holy Virgin, spotless,
   pure and holy, was born of her mother. That which was lost in Paradise
   was brought back again by her, that noble likeness which the Father had
   fashioned like unto Himself, and which had been spoiled. Through her
   the Father regenerated all His members, that they might be brought back
   again to their original Source; and of His unfathomable mercy God
   desired to raise us up again, through her, from the eternal death into
   which we had fallen, in as far as it was possible for us. Now we read
   these words of her in the Book of Wisdom: "Come over to me, all ye that
   desire me, that ye may be filled with my fruits." These are the words
   of the Heavenly Father Who guides and entices us to this birth. These
   words also were spoken by God, the Eternal Wisdom, of the Virgin; for
   this birth is also her birth. That which the Heavenly Father brought
   forth throughout eternity, she also brought forth; and this teaches us
   that we must and shall be filled to overflowing with this birth. She
   said: "To all those who desire to be satisfied in me, to all those who,
   in truth, desire and are satisfied by this birth, to them a glimpse
   will be given, sometimes, so that their longing may be excited and
   drawn forth to desire more and more." Say with St Augustine: "Lord,
   thou hast made us for Thyself, and therefore our hearts are always
   restless till we find rest in Thee." This restlessness, which should
   always and unceasingly be ours, is delayed and hindered by the strange
   births that are born of man. These are temporal, transitory, sensual,
   harmful things; delight and satisfaction in the creature, whether
   animate or inanimate; friendship and society; clothes, food, and all
   the things in which man delights. These things create restlessness in
   thee; and they beget such births in thee, so that God, as long as these
   births find place in thee with thy knowledge and consent, can never
   bring forth His birth in thee, in the joyful possession of thy heart.
   Some trifle, however small and mean it may be, takes from thee and robs
   thee of thy greatest good, and of the blissful birth that God desires
   to bring forth in thee; and it also takes away from thee all desire for
   it, and the consolation that thou oughtest to have after this birth;
   all this is kept back by this thing of pleasure.

   Now men often complain and say: "I have neither love nor desire;" that
   is just the hindrance which prevents thee and keeps thee back from love
   and desire, whatever it may be; no one knows so well as thou. Ask not
   me, but ask thyself, why thou hast no love or desire. Ye desire to
   posses both God and the creature; but that is impossible. Delight in
   God and delight in the creature cannot exist side by side. By this, I
   do not mean things which are necessary for man, and of which we cannot
   deprive nature, such as a hungry longing for food, and a thirsty
   craving for drink, the longing of the weary for rest and quiet, of the
   sleepy for sleep--as long as they do not become inordinate desires. But
   when man gives way to them, not for the needs or uses of nature, but
   for the pleasure of gratification, this birth is hindered; though less
   than in the enjoyment of other things; for the needs of nature require
   that pleasure in these things shall not be separated from them, as long
   as nature is at work.

   But the man who does not wish to hinder the Eternal Birth, but would
   make an entrance for it by means of the desire, must remember that the
   pleasures of the senses in nature, and in the creature, are hindrances;
   for the less of them, the more of the other; for the more cold goes
   out, the more warmth will come in; neither must man remain in his
   chamber idle and careless, and in gloomy weakness. Some men go about
   blindly, and all that they do is done blindly and foolishly in
   unfruitfulness. Thy confessor has no power over all these infirmities,
   which possess and deprave thee, if thou art willing to give way to
   them; though thou wert to confess ten times a day, it would not help
   thee at all, unless thou wert ready to give up thy sins. Thou must also
   know that, if thou art found thus wantonly possessed, loving the
   creature more than thou lovest God, thou wilt never appear before the
   Face of God. This is said everywhere in Scripture, and in all parts of
   the Gospel. There is the command in the Old and New Testaments, that
   man should love God above all things. And again: "He that doth not
   renounce all that he possesseth" is not worthy of Me. Again, elsewhere;
   "Not every one that saith to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doeth the Will of my Father Which is in
   heaven, he shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."

   Do ye imagine that God would give the Kingdom of Heaven to unholy
   beings, and that He shed His Precious Blood and gave up His Life for
   them? Look to yourselves; do not imagine that He would allow this to
   come to pass; and, if ye knew how severely God will judge them, ye
   would wither away in terror. God has given all things that they may be
   the way to Him; He only will be the Goal; nothing else can be, neither
   this nor that.

   Do ye imagine that I say this in derision? No, indeed! Thy Order can
   neither make thee holy nor blessed. My cowl, my tonsure, my cloister,
   my holy community--none of these things can make me holy. If I am to
   become holy, it must be in a holy, poor, uninhabited place. If I often
   cry: "Lord! Lord!" if I pray often, read much, say many beautiful
   things, understand much, and appear good?--no, no, it is something
   quite different that is needed. If thou deceivest thyself, it will hurt
   thee, not me.

   Your worldly hearts and minds, your vanity in the appearance of
   spirituality--all these things in thee will be tested, just as when a
   bud is set in a stock, all the fruit which the stock will bear will be
   like the bud and not after its own kind. Therefore all these strange
   external births with which ye are possessed, and all your fruit, will
   be tested by the bud. Also all your good works which ought to be
   divine, will be of the creature and nothing worth, because of the evil
   ground out of which they spring; for this birth takes place in all your
   powers, both within and without. Job said of this: "In the horror of a
   vision by night ...fear seized upon me and trembling, and all my bones
   were affrighted; and when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my
   flesh stood up." The horror of the vision in the night was the dark
   possession, which followed the incomprehensible horror and fearful
   trembling, so that all his bones were affrighted. The Spirit passing
   before him was God passing before him.

   Now the Gospel speaks here of two processions. One procession is that
   of the Spirit, that is of God to us; and the other procession is of
   ourselves to God; this must have an exit, as ye have heard, and as the
   Schoolmen say: "Two forms cannot exist together; if fire is kindled,
   the wood will be consumed; if the tree grows, the germ will disappear."
   If God is to enter into us, by the fulfillment of His Birth, then the
   creature will cease to exist. St Gregory says of this, that the hair of
   his head stood up when the Spirit passed before him,--these are the
   Levites whose hair must be cut off. They grow in the flesh like hair;
   and so also the tendency to old habits clings to the highest and lowest
   powers; they must be cut off with the sharp shears of holy diligence,
   which must be whetted and sharpened on the mighty and terrible
   judgments of God, and on the speedy justice of God, who will not leave
   the least thought unjudged. Even the least imagination, willingly
   received, must be cast off in the unsufferable fires of purgatory,
   before man can appear before God. Now, when these evil, unclean hairs
   have been cut off with sharp shears, then the hair grows again, and man
   must show renewed diligence. Some men are so diligent that, as soon as
   they are conscious of a thought, they cut it off at once with stern
   decision. At first it is rather hard to be always examining oneself;
   but afterwards, when man has accustomed himself thereto, it becomes
   quite easy; and he can blow away that for which at first he needed
   stern determination.

   Man must also be filled with active love, which must be universal; for
   he must not think particularly of this or that person, but of all men;
   not only of the good, but also of the common poor. Our Lady's father
   and mother, Joachim and Anne, were such good people. They divided all
   their goods into three parts. One part was for the service of God and
   for the Temple; another was for the common poor; and they lives on the
   third part themselves. Wherever parsimony exists, an unclean spot will
   be found which is very evil; man should be generous with these
   contemptible, transitory things. To him who gives will be given, and he
   who forgives will also be forgiven. As thou measurest, so will it be
   measured to thee again.

   Now, some men cleave to things within, on which also there is an evil
   growth which they do not perceive; and thus it might even come to pass
   that they might never come before God; and yet these men may have lived
   sincerely before God, and have given themselves up to severe
   discipline. But this is usually hidden in the lowest depths of their
   hearts; and they have not known it themselves, because they were
   wanting in self-control. Therefore it would be as well for such men,
   who wish to live to the truth, to have a Friend of God, to whom they
   could submit themselves, and who would direct them according to the
   Spirit of God; for, without some personal intercourse, it is not
   possible to prove the men who have these inner tendencies. Such men
   ought to seek an experienced Friend of God, even twenty miles round,
   who would know the right way and guide them aright. And, if no
   especially suitable man were to be found, then an ordinary confessor
   would do; for the Holy Spirit often speaks through such an one, on
   account of his office; though he be ever so rough, and is neither
   conscious of it, nor understands it himself; still men should submit
   themselves to him, and be in subjection, and not be their own guides.

   We have a perfect picture of this in the Blessed Virgin Mary. When she
   was a child, she was obedient to her father and mother; later she was
   under the care of the priest in the Temple; later she was under the
   care of St Joseph, later under that of our Lord Jesus Christ; later
   under that of St John, to whose care she was committed by our Lord, and
   who was to take His place. Now we pray earnestly that she will take us
   under her own care; and, as she was born on this day, so also she will
   bear us again in the true Source. Amen.

  SERMON XX

      On the Exaltation of the Holy Cross

      The first Sermon

   On the health-giving Cross, which is Christ Himself in His Humanity;
   how He must be exalted and raised up in us; and how all our powers must
   be drawn up after Him; the lowest and the highest, although, alas, this
   is neglected by many men. Also, many wise exhortations and incitements
   to members of Religious Orders to receive the Holy Sacrament, and to
   keep their other rules. How the crucified Christ must be born in us and
   of us through the three powers of the soul; and how we again must be
   born in Him, in the Fruit of His Spirit.

   Ego si exaltatus fuero a terra, omnia ad me traham.

   "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things unto
   Myself."

   To-day we celebrate the Festival of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross,
   on which hung, out of love, the Salvation of the World. We must be born
   again, through the Cross, into the true nobility which was ours in
   eternity. We must be born and revived there again by love for this
   Cross. Words cannot describe the merits of the Cross. Our Lord said:
   "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things unto Me." By
   this He signifies that He wishes to draw to Himself our worldly hearts,
   and our love for and gratification in worldly things, which we had
   gladly possessed in the creature, and our haughty minds, which were
   well satisfied with ourselves, and with our worldly-mindedness and
   love, in the temporal gratification of our senses. All this He will
   draw unto Himself, that He may be thus exalted, and that He may become
   great in us and in our hearts; for to the man to whom God has ever been
   great, all creatures seem small, and fleeting pleasures are as nothing.

   This health-giving Cross signifies the Noble Man, Christ, Who is
   exalted far above our imagination, above Saints and Angels, and above
   all the joy, bliss and blessedness that they enjoy together; and, as
   His true place is in the Highest, He desires to dwell also in our
   highest places, that is in our uppermost and innermost love and
   desires. He will draw up the lowest powers to the highest, and lead the
   lowest with the highest unto Himself. If we do this, He will draw us
   after Himself into His highest and most secret place. For thus it must
   needs be; if I am to come to Him, I must receive Him into myself. So
   much of mine, so much of His; it is an equal bargain.

   Oh! how often this Holy Cross is quite forgotten, so that this ground
   and secret place is quite closed up and refused to God, while favour
   and love are shown to the creature; which, sad to say, in these
   dangerous times, reigns supreme both in worldly and religious people,
   so that their hearts are lost in the creature. This is the most
   grievous pity that man's heart and mind can conceive; and, if he only
   knew how it would end, he would wither up in terror of the vengeance of
   God. But it is as much unheeded as though it were all mockery. It has,
   also, become the custom, and men approve of it, and call it an honour,
   and it is all as though it were a play. The Saints, if they could,
   would cry aloud and weep tears of blood, and the Wounds of our Lord
   would be torn open again by this misery; that a heart, for which He
   gave His beautiful Life and His loving Holy Spirit, should be so
   shamelessly taken from Him, while He is driven forth. Children, do not
   thing that these are my words only; all Scripture teaches you this: "No
   man can serve two masters. For he will hate the one and love the
   other." Jesus says: "If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it
   from thee;" and elsewhere: "Where thy treasure is, there is thy heart
   also." Now, find out how much God has of thy heart; whether He is thy
   Treasure. St Augustine says: "Lovest thou the earth, thou art also of
   the earth; for the soul is more with that which she loveth, than where
   she gives life to the body." St Paul says: "If I should deliver my body
   to be burned, and should speak with the tongues of men and of Angels,
   and should give all my goods to feed the poor, and yet not have
   charity, it profiteth me nothing."

   Now, dear sisters, ye ought, with great and adoring thankfulness and
   active love, to accept the grace which God has given to your Order
   through the Sacrament of the Body of the Lord. I desire, also, with all
   my heart and soul, that this practice should not be allowed to grow
   slack nor fall asleep in these anxious times; for nature will not long
   endure; ye must cleave firmly to God, or ye will fall away. Mark, it
   was not thus in days gone by; therefore, these people ought to exercise
   great and powerful self-restraint, that they may be preserved from this
   dangerous state. Do not imaging that this need be done to attain to a
   state of great perfection: "They that are in health need not a
   physician, but they that are ill." It is necessary, on account of man's
   human weakness, that he should be protected by God's help, and
   preserved from the sad state of things which prevails widely amongst
   religious people. Therefore, none should speak as though they had
   attained to great perfection or did great deeds. It is sufficient, if
   they keep the rules of their Order, as far as they can, and mean to do
   so, and that they have permission to leave undone that which they
   cannot do. No great powers of reason are necessary for this. It will
   suffice, if they desire to do willingly that which is right, and if
   their eyes are so far opened that they will be able to guard themselves
   against this grievous wrong, and if they keep their eyes open. For this
   reason, our young sisters should go often and willingly to receive the
   Lord's Body. I excuse and also answer for our dear elder sisters, for
   they went very reverently in days gone by, when the flesh was not so
   weak as now; and they kept their Order very strictly, and loved and
   obeyed the rules. They also readily kept up the good old custom of
   communicating every fortnight. Their great sanctity and perfection were
   sufficient; for in those days things were better than now, and less
   harmful to the fallen nature to be found in young people, whose
   inclinations are stronger now than they were then. Therefore much more
   help is needed now than then; and without great sefl-restraint it is
   impossible to endure in the highest state. Now everything sinks down to
   the level of animal pleasures, and the desires of the senses.
   Therefore, dear sisters, I require of you no great perfection and
   sanctity, only that ye should feel joy in and love for our Holy Order,
   and that ye should intend to keep the rules as far as ye can, and that
   ye should willingly keep silence in all places where it is ordained--at
   table and in the choir, and that ye should withdraw yourselves
   willingly from all human intimacies that estrange you from God. The old
   are impelled to do so by holiness, and the young by modesty. For if ye
   do this devoutly, God will reveal Himself to you, while ye flee from
   all the causes that could bring this hurt to your souls. Learn, that
   intolerable sufferings have fallen upon some convents; and, if they had
   not exercised themselves very diligently in this discipline, they might
   have been brought to nought. If ye experience no sweetness, do not let
   this terrify you. If man does his part, and yet feels forsaken in his
   heart, it is far better for him, that any feelings or experiences would
   be that he could have. This bitter grief brings him nearer to the
   Source of Living Truth than any feelings. Our Lord said: "My God, my
   God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" and on Mount Olivet: "Not as I will,
   but as Thou wilt."

   Children, fear not, for our Lord says: "If any man will come after
   Me....let him take up his Cross and follow Me." This Cross signifies
   the crucified Jesus, Who ought to be and must be born. St Paul says:
   "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with all its lusts."
   These lusts must be tamed and restrained.

   The second power is the power of anger, which man should be able to
   control in all things. He should always think that another is more
   likely to be right than he, and thus avoid strife. He must learn
   forbearance, and how to be quiet and kindly wherever he may be. One man
   may be sitting alone, or in an assembly, while others are sitting
   there, who are noisy and seldom silent. Ye must learn to be forbearing
   and to endure, and to commune with your own hearts. A man cannot work
   at a trade without having learnt it. If any one wanted to be an
   umbrella-maker, and would not learn his trade, he might do great harm
   to the work if he tried to carry it on before he had learned it; thus
   it is in all adversities, we must learn how to struggle.

   The two other powers, by which this noble Cross must be borne, are not
   so evident; they are the powers of reason, and of inwardly spiritual
   desires. Thus, in short, Christ must be born in us and of us, in the
   inner and outer man; and thus we shall be born again in Him, in the
   Fruit of His Spirit. As it is written: "Ye must be as new-born babes."
   Dear children, if ye live thus, every day will be consecrated; and all
   your sins will be forgiven you in this birth of the Holy Cross. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SERMON XXI

      On the Exaltation of the Holy Cross

      The Second Sermon

   How Christ draws all things unto Himself; how He prepares man according
   to his powers, both outwardly and inwardly, by many changes and
   chances, that he may come at last with his whole heart to the secret
   place of the Divine Abyss; and how some men scarcely succeed in
   understanding how they an follow this drawing.

   Ego si exaltatus fuero a terra, omnia ad me traham.

   "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things unto
   Myself."

   To-day we celebrate the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, whose worth it is
   impossible to describe, and to which all the honour that we can
   conceive is due, because we give it to Him, Who died thereon. Therefore
   religious people take up the Cross, and begin to fast according to
   their rule; and this is a thing worth doing by all who have it in their
   power.

   Now, we are told how a Christian king once took the Holy Cross to a
   Pagan king, with all the honour and dignity that his dominions could
   produce, in accordance with his rank, though not in accordance with the
   honour due to the Holy Cross; and he wanted to go to Jerusalem. When he
   arrived before the gates, they closed themselves by means of a strong,
   thick wall; and an Angel, who was standing on the wall, said: "Thou
   comest here with the Cross, riding in great pomp; and yet He, Who died
   thereon, was driven forth in great sorrow and shame, barefoot, and
   carrying the Cross on His back." Then the king threw himself from his
   horse, tore off all his clothes, save his shirt, and bore the Holy
   Cross on his back. Then the gates opened of themselves, and he bore it
   into the city, where many wonderful signs were done, on the sick, the
   lame and the blind.

   Our Lord said: "I, if I be lifted up...will draw all things unto Me."
   [27] As St Gregory says: "Man is all things, for he has a likeness with
   all things." Many men may be found, who find the Cross, and are drawn
   to it by manifold sufferings and much discipline, that God may thus
   draw them to Himself; but this suffering must be lifted up; as we
   to-day celebrate the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, so it must not only
   be found but also lifted up. If man would only examine himself, and
   commune with his own heart, he would find the Cross twenty times a day
   in many a painful suggestion and fall, whereby, were he alone, he would
   be crucified; but he does not lift it up, and thus he wrongs it. All
   the burdens of the Cross should be lifted up in God, and willingly
   accepted by man as his Cross, both without and within, in the body and
   in the spirit. Thus man should be drawn to God, Who desires to draw all
   things unto Himself, as He said when He was about to be lifted up.

   Now, men may be found, who outwardly bear this Cross, disciplining
   themselves well externally, and bearing the burden of their Order. They
   sing, they read, they go to the choir, or to the refectory; and thus,
   with the outer man, carry on small services for our Lord. Do ye imagine
   that ye were created and made for that only by God? He desires also to
   have you for His especial Friends. Now such men bear the Cross
   externally, but they carefully protect themselves from its entrance
   into themselves, and seek distraction wherever they can. They do not
   carry the Cross with our Lord, but with Simon Rufus who was compelled
   to carry it. But even bearing it thus is very good; for it protects
   them indeed from many vices and from levity, and it saves them from the
   terrible fires of purgatory, and possibly from an eternity in hell.

   Now, our dear Lord says that He "will draw all things unto Himself." He
   who desires to draw things, must first collect them and then draw them.
   This our Lord does also; He first gathers up all man's wanderings, the
   dissipation of his senses, his powers, his words and works, and
   inwardly, all his thoughts and intentions, his imaginations, his
   desires and pleasures and his understanding. Then, when all are
   collected, God draws the man to Himself. For, first of all ye must cast
   off all to which ye cling externally and internally in your
   gratifications. This casting off is a weary Cross, and the heavier and
   stronger the clinging is, the heavier the Cross will also be. For all
   the pleasure and delight that ye have in the creature, however holy and
   divine it may appear to be, or is called, or as it may seem to
   thee--all must be cast off, if thou desirest to be truly lifted up and
   drawn to God. This is the first and lowest grade in the outer man.

   If ye desire to raise the Cross in the inner man, it is necessary that
   all inner delights should be withdrawn from him, all clinging to
   spiritual pleasures, and even from those which arise out of virtue. The
   Schoolmen dispute as to whether man should make use of any virtue; it
   ought to be used fruitfully and only in God's service. These things
   cannot, indeed, exist without pleasure; but it should be without any
   addition of self. What do ye imagine that pleasure and satisfaction
   consist of? That a man willingly fasts, watches, prays and carries out
   the rules of his Order? This pleasure our Lord would have nothing to do
   with; He desired that I should act rightly towards my Order. Why do ye
   imagine that God seldom allows a day or a night to pass by like that
   which preceded it, and that what helped you in meditation yesterday,
   does not help you at all to-day or to-morrow, and that many
   imaginations and ideas come to you with no results? Take thy Cross from
   God and suffer, and then it will become a blissful Cross. How couldest
   thou otherwise carry it to God, and receive it from Him in true
   resignation, and thank God for it, and say with our dear Lady: "My soul
   doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour;"
   for thou must thus praise and glorify God in every thing.

   Man must always have a Cross; it was necessary that Christ should
   suffer before He entered into His glory. Whatever thou mayest encounter
   in thy inmost heart, either in seeing or tasting, let it alone, do not
   meddle with it, ask not what it is, but fall back upon thy nothingness.
   Our Lord said: "If any man will come after Me...let him take up his
   Cross and follow Me." It is not in comfort, but with the Cross that we
   must follow God. The Holy Apostle, St Andrew, said: "I welcome thee,
   thou much-to-be-desired Cross, for I have longed for thee with all my
   heart. Take me from amongst men, and give me again to my Master." This
   must not take place one day and not on the next; but it must go on at
   all times, unceasingly; thou must ever be examining thyself in all
   things. Yes, though the number of thy sins and transgressions be great;
   if thou fallest seventy times a day, yet turn and come again to God,
   and pass on so quickly to God that thy sin will escape thy memory, and
   when thou comest to confession thou wilt not be able to say what it
   was. This should not terrify thee; it did not come to pass for thy
   hurt, but to show thee thy nothingness, and to make thee feel contempt
   for thyself. Ye should do all calmly, and not dejectedly, if ye feel
   that in your hearts ye are ready and prepared to do the Will of God.
   Man is not sinless, as our dear Lady was, therefore he must be content
   to bear all this suffering and this Cross. St Paul says: "We know that
   to them that love God, all things work together unto good;" the gloss
   adds "and sin also." Hold thy peace, flee unto God, and look upon thy
   nothingness; stay at home, do not run at once to thy confessor. St
   Matthew followed God at once, and leaving all his affairs unsettled;
   and, if thou findest that thou hast sinned, do not make thy Cross too
   heavy outwardly. Leave it to truth, and be faithful and at rest; for
   none will be condemned except those who wantonly turn to temporal
   things; while to those who delight in the love of God, and think only
   of Him, everything will prove a discipline.

   Yet, I must warn you in all faithfulness that, if ye willingly allow
   yourselves to be possessed by the creature, and give it place, it will
   most assuredly cause your condemnation; and, even if God gives you true
   repentance, though this is uncertain, yet ye will have to suffer in the
   awful fires of purgatory. If ye realised it, ye might shrivel up in
   great fear and anxiety; and if ye went thus to receive the Lord's Body,
   ye would be acting just as if thou wert to take a young and tender
   child and tread it underfoot in a miry path. And yet this is done to
   the living Son of God, Who, out of love, has given Himself for us. Thus
   ye go to confession, and do not guard yourselves against the cause of
   your sin. The Pope with all his Cardinals could not absolve you; for
   yours is no true repentance, and ye are guilty of the Holy Body of our
   Lord.

   Our Lord said: "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and
   take up his Cross and follow Me." This self-denial and this Cross are
   held before many a Friend of God, who is driven towards it, so that we
   cannot say how a man ought to forget himself and deny himself in all
   the circumstances that may arise. That which costs nothing is
   worthless. "He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly" and
   "with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again." but no
   one should think of this, but solely of God. What will become of all
   those of whom ye might be told, who will not leave their old ways and
   customs, but who cleave externally to that which is real to their
   senses? Thou must forsake thyself and die utterly to thyself. He said:
   "Follow thou Me." The servant does not go before his master; he follows
   after him. Not according to the servant's will, but according to the
   will of the master. No other teaching is necessary for us, if we only
   take heed how little, in this world, servants can follow their own
   will; but how they must use all their diligence and all their strength
   in carrying out in all ways their master's will and service. A grain of
   wheat must die before it can bring forth fruit, and so must thou also
   die absolutely to thy own will. Man ought therefore to give up himself
   and his own will entirely to God; and, when he thus gives himself from
   his heart to God, he ought to be as though he possessed no will. A
   virgin stood in the choir and sang: and said: "Lord, this time is mine
   and Thine, but, if I commune with my own heart, my time is Thine not
   mine."

   If man is to give himself to God, he must first of all give up his own
   will entirely, for man is just as though he were formed of three men:
   his animal nature, in which he is guided by his senses; his powers of
   reason; and his highest nature, which is in the Image and Likeness of
   God. In his highest and innermost nature man should turn and lie down
   in the fire of the Divine Abyss, and come out of himself, and allow
   himself to be taken prisoner. He should suppress and pass over the two
   lowest ways and natures, as St Bernard says: "Man must draw away his
   animal nature, with the lusts of the flesh, from all the things that he
   possessed with delight." Ye know what a hard Cross that is, and how
   heavy it is! And he says, that it is no less hard for the outer man to
   enter into the inner man, and to pass, from things that are figurative
   and visible, to the invisible, that is to their very Source, as St
   Augustine understands it. All the attacks and the crosses, that, coming
   to the two lower natures of man, seem to him as though they would draw
   him away and hinder him from entering, should be taken up by him as his
   Cross, while he commends all to God. Whether they come from the senses
   or from reason, he should leave them all alone, and commend them to the
   lower powers. And he should raise himself above them in the highest
   power with all his might; just s Abraham left the ass and the servant
   below, when he went up the mountain to offer his sacrifice unto God; he
   went up alone with his son into the mountain. Therefore, leave your
   animal nature which is indeed an ass, and your servant, which is
   natural reason, which is here surely a servant, for it has served, and
   guide man up the ascent of this mountain; for there he must stay. Leave
   the two below, and go up alone with the son, that is with thy mind,
   into the secret place, the Holy of Holies. Offer up thy sacrifice, and
   especially offer up thyself, and enter in, and hide there thy secret
   mind in the mystery of the Divine Abyss. As the prophet said in the
   Psalter: "Lord, Thou shalt hide them in the secret of Thy Face." In
   that secret place the created spirit is brought back again to its
   uncreatedness, where it had been from everlasting before it was
   created, and where it recognises itself as God in God, and yet in
   itself as of the creature, and created. But in God all things are God,
   who rest on this foundation. Proclus says: "When man once enters here,
   whatever may befall the outer man, sorrow, poverty or whatever it may
   be, he heeds it not." As the Prophet says: "Thou shalt hide them...from
   the disturbance of men." These follow our Lord, as our Lord says
   elsewhere: "I am in the Father, and He is in Me, and I in you and ye in
   Me." That we may be drawn with all our hearts, as He desired to draw
   all things after Him, and that we may thus inherit the Cross, that by
   the Holy Cross we may enter into the true Source, may God help us.
   Amen.

  SERMON XXII

      On the Exaltation of the Holy Cross

      The Third Sermon

   Describe a Cross of Spiritual Suffering formed by four virtues. Divine
   Love is the upper part, Patient Love is on the left side, Inner Purity
   is on the right, and Willing Obedience forms the lower part. Also much
   good advice and many instructions for those who look upon themselves as
   sick and guilty sinners; for the Cross must be borne.

   Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libano, it quasi cypressus in monte Sion.

   "I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress-tree on Mount
   Sion."

   We celebrate to-day the Exaltation of the Holy Cross; but it is
   impossible to say how it was raised up; neither can we fully describe
   or imagine its value. We can say of it that which we find written in
   the Book of Ecclesiasticus: "I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and
   as a cypress-tree on Mount Sion."

   Frankincense grows on Mount Lebanon; it signifies a spiritual
   sacrifice, for it should at all times be the desire of our hearts to be
   peculiar sacrifice unto God. The smoke of the cedar tree drives away
   all the poison of the serpent. Still more the poison of the Devil and
   all his wicked cunning is chased away by the power of the Holy Cross;
   that is by the bitter Sorrow and sharp Suffering of our Lord Jesus
   Christ; for He says of Himself: "I was exalted like a cypress-tree on
   Mount Sion." The cypress is of such a nature, that if a man partakes of
   the wood, when unable to retain his food, it enables him to retain it.
   In the same way, the man who draws unto himself the Lord's Holy Cross,
   and embraces it, namely, His painful and bitter Suffering, will be
   enabled to retain that most precious and noble Food, the Holy Word of
   God. The holy saints and prophets have said that the Word of God only
   becomes fruitful in those men, who at all times draw it earnestly and
   diligently unto themselves, that all things may become fruitful unto
   them. The precious Sufferings of our Lord have also a sweet scent,
   tasting sweeter than any sweetness; for they draw man's heart to Him;
   as our Lord Himself has said: "And I, if I be lifted up...will draw all
   things to Myself." It is indeed true, that the man in whom the bitter
   Suffering of our Lord is always found, will at all times be drawn unto
   our Lord, in true humility, and patience, and with fervent and Divine
   Love. For in the same way that Christ suffered willingly, so must we
   also at all times, as far as lies in our power, follow after Him
   earnestly, in patience and suffering, that we may always be imprisoned,
   bound and condemned with Him in spirit.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, before He was nailed to the Holy Cross, was
   bereft of all His garments, so that not a thread was left on His Body;
   and lots were cast for His garments before His eyes. Now, know of a
   truth, that if thou desirest ever to come to true perfection, thou must
   be destitute of all that is not of God, so that thou hast not a thread
   left; and thou must see lots cast for thy things before thine eyes;
   while other men look upon it all, and esteem it as mockery, folly and
   heresy. Our Lord said: "If any man will come after Me, let him...take
   up his Cross, and follow Me." As he said also to the young man: "If
   thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the
   poor...and come, follow Me." For it is written in the Apocalypse that
   great and unutterable plagues must come, which will be scarcely less
   terrible than the Judgment Day; though that will not come yet, for we
   are still living in historic time, days years and hours. And when these
   plagues which are prophesied, come upon us, those only will recover who
   bear the Cross. And because this was true, God gave the Angel leave to
   hurt and to destroy all that was upon the earth. Then God said to the
   Angel: "Thou shalt spare none, save those who have the banner, the
   mark, the sign on their foreheads," signifying the Holy Cross. Every
   man who has not the Cross of Jesus Christ in him and before him,
   undoubtedly, will not be spared. By the Cross we understand pain. God
   did not tell the Angel to spare men with great powers, nor the sects,
   nor those who worked in their own way, but only the suffering. He did
   not say: "He, who will follow Me, or come after Me, must follow Me,
   gazing at Me," but he said, "by leaving all and suffering."

   Now I wish to say a few words about the Cross. Know then, that every
   man who takes up the Cross will be made thereby the very best man to be
   found in these days; and no plagues can harm him. Neither can he ever
   enter into purgatory. But also there is no greater pain than daily and
   hourly carrying a Cross on our backs for the sake of God, in humble
   resignation. It is, alas! no longer the fashion to suffer for the sake
   of God, and to bear the Cross for Him; for the diligence and real
   earnestness, that perchance were found in man, have been extinguished
   and have grown cold; and now no one is willing any longer to suffer
   distress for the sake of God. Could we find out any way in which no one
   would have to suffer, that is what we should choose for our life. Alas!
   one and all think only of self, in all their works and ways.

   It is not outward exercises, such as fasting, watching, lying of hard
   beds, and making long pilgrimages, that please God. All these things
   serve thereto; fasting, watching, prayer, and all the other things
   already mentioned; therefore, do all these things, as far as they will
   help thee to take up thy Cross truly. No one is too old, too ill and
   too deaf to take up the Cross, and to carry it after our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Learn that the Holy Cross is made of four pieces of wood, one above,
   one below, and two in the middle. The upper part is divine, fervent
   love. The left arm, which is deep humility, is nailed on with the
   heedlessness of men, and all the things that may befall him then; it is
   more than scorn, for in that there is a tinge of pride; the other arm
   of the Cross must be real, true, inner purity, this must be nailed to
   the Cross with a willing lack of all, whatever it may be, that could
   defile its purity, either outwardly or inwardly. The feet signify true
   and perfect obedience; they are nailed on with true and willing
   resignation of all that thou and thine possess. Whatever it may be that
   thou possessest, leave all at once for the sake of God, however hard it
   may be, that thou mayest not possess thyself in any way, either in deed
   or in word. The four parts of the Cross were fastened together in the
   middle with fiat voluntas tuna, which means that the pieces of wood
   were fitted into each other, signifying the true and perfect
   renunciation of thy free will, and a yielding up of all for the sake of
   God.

   Now notice, first, the left hand, which signifies humility. By this we
   must understand, as St Augustine says, that the man who walks in true
   humility will most certainly have to suffer. Know, that man must be
   brought to nought in his own esteem, and in the eyes of all men. He
   must also be raised up, bare, and having no resting place, and lots
   must be cast before his eyes for all that he has or is; as was done
   with the garments of our Lord Jesus Christ; that is, thou must be
   mocked, destroyed and spurned. Thy life also must be regarded as
   unworthy of notice, as folly, so that those who are with thee or pass
   thee by, will scorn and condemn thee, will estimate and judge thy life
   before thy face, as full of error and heresy; and hate thee and all thy
   works and ways. Now, when thou knowest and seest all this, thou must
   neither reject it, nor receive it unthankfully, so that thou speakest
   evil, or shouldest say of it: "Such a man as he is unfair to me." Dear
   friend, guard thyself both outwardly and inwardly against such
   opposition. Thou oughtest to think: "Alas! I, poor man, am unworthy
   that such a noble man should scorn and ignore me;" and then thou
   shouldest bow to it and look upon it as nothing. Thus thou wilt be
   bearing the Cross with our Lord. The right hand is true purity; it is
   nailed on with a willing lack of all things that are not of God, and
   that could stain that purity. The feet are true obedience, and signify
   that man should be obedient to his Superiors and the Holy Church. They
   are nailed on with true resignation, so that man will willingly in all
   things resign himself to the Will of God. The middle part is the free
   going out and giving up of thy will to the Will of God; which means,
   however great the suffering may be which is laid upon thee by God or
   man, thou wilt yet willingly suffer all for love of God, and rejoice,
   and bend willingly to the Cross of suffering, whether guilty or
   innocent. Now, thou mightest say: "Lord, I cannot do it, I am too
   weak." Learn then, that thou hast two wills, an upper and a lower will,
   as Christ also had two wills. The natural and lower will desires at all
   times to be freed from the Cross; but the higher says with Christ: "Not
   as I will but as Thou wilt in all things." The top of the Cross is the
   Love of God; it has no resting place, for at all times it is a pure,
   bare going forth, forsaken of God and all creatures, so that thou canst
   truly say with Christ: "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" The
   Sacred Head of our Lord Jesus Christ had no resting place; if a man
   experienced Divine Love and a sweet consciousness of God's Presence in
   his absolute resignation, what would it matter to him though the whole
   world were against him?

   A good and holy man asked our Lord why He allowed His dear Friends to
   suffer so terribly. Then our Lord said: "Man is naturally inclined to
   the pleasures of the senses and harmful delights; therefore I hedge him
   in, in all his ways, so that I alone may be his delight." The Head of
   Divine, sweet Love hung inclined on the stem of the Holy Cross. Learn,
   children, it cannot be otherwise; though we try to turn it as we may,
   we must always bear a Cross, if we desire to be good men and to come to
   Eternal Life. We must suffer sharply and keenly, and bear a Cross of
   some kind, for, if we flee from one, another will fall upon us. No man
   has ever been born, who was such a good talker that he could prove that
   this was not true. Thou canst flee where thou wilt, and do what thou
   wilt, yet it must be borne. God may take it on His shoulder for a
   little while, and bear the burden over the most difficult places; and
   then man feels so light and free, that he cannot believe that he ever
   had anything to suffer, especially because he feels no suffering; but,
   as soon as God lays down the burden, the burden of suffering rests
   heavily on him again, in all its bitterness and insupportability. The
   Eternal Son of God, Jesus Christ, has borne all this before, in the
   heaviest way possible; and all those who have been His dearest Friends
   have borne it after Him. This Cross is the fiery chariot in which Elias
   went up to heaven.

   There was a thoughtful daughter of our Order who had longed much and
   often to see our Lord as a Babe. Suddenly, during her devotions, our
   Lord appeared to her as a Babe, lying swathed in a bed of sharp thorns,
   so that she could not get to the Babe till she had laboured much, and
   had used force, in grasping the thorns. When she came to herself again
   she realised that those who truly desire Him must boldly face pain,
   sharpness and suffering.

   Some men say: "Yea, and were I so pure and innocent, that I had not
   deserved it from God on account of my sins, still I would gladly and
   joyfully bear suffering for the Will of God, so that it might be useful
   and profitable to me." Now, know, that a guilty and sinful man may
   suffer, in such a way, that it may be more useful and profitable to him
   than to an innocent man. But how? In the same way, that a man, who
   wants to make a great jump, will go back that he may have a good run;
   for the further he goes back, the further he will jump. Every man
   should act in this way. He must always look upon himself as sinful and
   heedless, and must judge of himself as unworthy in the sight of God and
   of all creatures. Thus he will be drawn nearer and more powerfully to
   God, and by this means he will get closer to the Eternal Goodness of
   Divine Truth.

   Children, the more thoroughly a man knows himself from the bottom of
   his heart, truly despising and condemning himself, not glossing over
   his sins, but deeming himself utterly unworthy, the nearer will he draw
   to God in truth, and the more perfect will be his converse with God.

   That we may all draw this precious Cross of our Lord after us, in
   steadfast patience and with loving hearts, with happy countenances,
   cheerfully, joyfully and willingly suffering all things for God, giving
   up all things for Him, and accepting all things that are disagreeable
   to us as from the open, loving Hand of God and not from the creature;
   that we may be lifted up in our hearts in steadfast patience even unto
   the end, may He help us, Who for our sakes was lifted up upon the Cross
   that He might draw all things unto Himself. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SERMON XXIII

      On the Feast of St Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist

   Of two ways in which man may follow after God in true resignation. One
   way is in a figure; the other has no form; it consists of a calm, inner
   silence in a tranquil mind.

   Sequere Me.

   "Follow me." Our Lord spake to St Matthew saying: "Follow Me." And he
   rose up, and forsook all, and followed Him.

   This holy Matthew has become an example to all men; and yet he was, to
   begin with, a great sinner, as the Scripture tells us; but afterwards
   he became one of the greatest Friends of God; for, when our Lord spake
   secretly to him in his heart, he left all things and followed Him.
   Everything depends upon man's following God in truth; and this involves
   an absolute forsaking of all things, whatever they may be, which have
   taken possession of man's heart, and which are not of God. For God is a
   Lover of hearts, and communes not with anything that is external. He
   desires an inner, living, love, which is ever ready to turn to all
   things that are divine and virtuous, where and in whomsoever they may
   be found; for there is more truth in such an once than in a man who
   prays as much as all the rest of the world, and sings so lustily that
   his song reaches to heaven; or in anything that he can do by fasting,
   watching, or anything else externally.

   Now our Lord said: "Follow Me." There are six ways in which men can
   follow our Lord; three are in our lower, and three in our higher
   powers. In the lower there are humility, gentleness and patience. The
   other three are higher than all other powers; they are faith, hope and
   love. Our Lord said: "Follow." This following, in one way, is to be,
   after the example of our Lord, in praise and thanksgiving; while
   sometimes it comes to pass in a still closer way; that is, without any
   conditions of thought or of anything else, but only in an inner
   silence, in a mind that communes with itself, simply waiting on God,
   that He may work in it as it pleases Him.

   It is easy to find men who get on well with their outward exercises.
   They glide through them, whether these be fasting, watching, prayer or
   anything else; and they take so much delight in them, that God has a
   very small part in them. The pleasure sometimes seems to be so great
   that God is not there at all, and has turned away; which means, that
   such men do their work as of themselves, adding thereto, and finding
   pleasure therein; though all good is of God, and not a shred belongs to
   man.

   Now, we might ask: "How can we separate pleasure from that which is
   good? Let us take an example. In the Old Testament the priests were
   forbidden to eat the fat of the sacrifices; they were to burn it and
   offer all to God. But they might eat the fat of the flesh which was
   their allotted portion. Thus all the delight that we have in all the
   exercise of virtue and in works must be cast into the fire of love,
   from whence it proceeds. But the natural pleasure or satisfaction which
   clings to natural actions, in as far as they are good, may be engaged
   by man in a simple way, if he does not add thereto.

   Now, we must notice in these words: "Follow Me," that St Matthew left
   all things and followed God. Man, when he leaves all things and himself
   in all things, must follow God more than all; in the outer man, in all
   exercises of virtue, in universal love; and, in the inner man, by real
   resignation of himself in all ways, both outwardly and inwardly. Now,
   understand that when I speak of myself, I am speaking of all men. By
   God's Grace and from Holy Christendom, I have received both my order
   and my cowl, this habit and my priesthood, that I might become a
   teacher and hear confessions. Now, if it came to pass that the Pope and
   also the Holy Church, from whom I have received them, wished to take
   them all away from me, if I were a temperate man, I should let them go,
   and I should not ask why they did so. If I might, I should put on a
   gray garb, and I should not remain any longer in the monastery with the
   brethren, nor be a priest and hear confessions and preach. I should
   also say that in God's name all was at an end; for they gave all to me,
   and may therefore take all from me. Why, it would not be for me to ask.
   Why? because I do not wish to be called a heretic, or to be
   excommunicated; and thus I should be truly resigned. But if any one
   else wanted to take these things from me, I would rather die than allow
   them to be taken from me.

   Again, if the Holy Church were to refuse us the Holy Sacrament
   externally, we must submit; but in a spiritual sense no one an take it
   from us. We must be ready to give up all without murmuring or answering
   again; but all this is external. Thus it ought to be, and even still
   more so in things that are within. What have we that was not given us
   by God? Therefore, all that He gave us must be given to Him again; we
   must give up all in true resignation, as though we had never obtained
   it.

   You, dear children, who occupy yourselves with sacred pictures, holy
   thoughts, and works and ways, are not referred to here. I am not
   speaking to you; ye need not take this address to yourselves. But I
   mean those especially who have to go along the dark road, and to pass
   through the narrow way, which is not the road for all men. These men
   must take a very different road from those of whom we have just spoken;
   and we will now speak of them; of what things they must have, and how
   some things are to be done and others left undone. Man should have all
   these things in his powers, without anything of self and beyond all
   powers; and he must posses them without any qualifications. Now, it is
   according to man's nature to desire to have, to know and to will. These
   are all the works of men's powers. Now, there are six things of which
   we must now take note. There are three in the lower, and three in the
   higher powers. In the lower, are humility, gentleness and patience,
   which answer to these three. Humility sinks at once and for ever into
   an abyss, and loses its name and rests in absolute nothingness, and
   knows nothing but humility. Gentleness has robbed love of the
   qualification of will; so that all things are alike, nothing is
   antagonistic; therefore there is no consciousness of any virtue, and
   all things are possessed in an even peace; virtue has lost its name and
   has become simply a condition. So also is it with patience. These men
   love and thirst after suffering and know nothing of patience.

   Now, after all this resignation, it may happen that a hard word is
   spoken to thee; but do not let it affright thee; God has decreed it for
   thy good, that thou mayest sink yet deeper into thy nothingness. Then
   anger arises, and points to still greater renunciation, and shows thee
   thy nothingness, that thou mayest even think thyself unworthy that God
   should implant in thee one good thought. Everything depends upon this;
   a fathomless sinking in a fathomless nothingness. The doings of these
   men do not depend upon external works, or customs, or pictures; but, if
   they do well, their existence will be blessed beyond all measure; but
   in its way it is as full of care as that of the most savage men on
   earth. For this way is a dark way; and, as I said of Job: "A man whose
   way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness." Man must
   bear all the reproaches heaped upon him on this rough road, in a
   self-denying way; even all the reproaches that can be imagined. Our
   Lord says everywhere: "Follow Me, go through all things. I am He; go
   not further; follow Me." If a man were to say: "Lord, who art Thou,
   that I must follow Thee through such deep, gloomy, miserable paths?"
   The Lord would reply, "I am God and Man, and far more God." If a man
   could answer then, really and consciously from the bottom of his heart:
   "Then I am nothing, and less than nothing;" all would be accomplished;
   for the Godhead has really no place to work in, but ground where all
   has been annihilated. As the Schoolmen say, when a new form is to come
   into existence, the old must of necessity be destroyed. They say: "When
   a child is conceived in the mother's womb, it is at first simply
   matter; later it takes an animal form; it lives as an animal; and then,
   at the appointed time, God creates a reasoning soul and casts it into
   the matter." Then the first form disappears in blessedness; that which
   is created, form, size and colour must all disappear, so that nothing
   is left save simple matter. And so I say: "If man is to be thus clothed
   upon with this being; all the forms must of necessity be done away,
   that were ever received by him in all his powers--of perception,
   knowledge, will, work, of subjection, sensibility and self-seeking."
   When St Paul saw nothing, he saw God. So also, when Elias wrapped his
   face in his mantle, God came. All strong rocks are broken here; all on
   which the spirit can rest be done away. Then, when all forms have
   ceased to exist, in the twinkling of an eye, the man is transformed.
   Therefore thou must make an entrance. Thereupon speaks the Heavenly
   Father to him: "Thou shalt call Me Father, and shalt never cease to
   enter in; entering ever further in, ever nearer, so as to sink the
   deeper in an unknown and unnamed abyss; and, above all ways, images and
   forms, and above all powers, to lose thyself, deny thyself and even
   unform thyself." In this lost condition, nothing is to be seen but a
   ground which rests upon itself, everyone being, one life. It is thus,
   man may say, that he becomes, unknowing, unloving and senseless. This
   is not the result of natural qualities, but of the transformation,
   wrought by the Spirit of God in the created spirit, in the fathomless
   lost condition of the created spirit, and in his fathomless
   resignation. We may say of this, that God knows, loves and gives
   Himself thus; for man is nothing but a life, a being and action. Those
   who see in this way, with undue liberty and with false light, are in
   the most perilous state in which it is possible to be in this life.

   The way by which we must arrive at the goal, is through the precious
   Life and Sufferings of our dear Lord; for He is the Way by which we
   must go, and He is the Truth which lightens all in this way. He is the
   Life and the End to which men must come; and He is the Door; and
   whosoever entereth in by another door is a murderer. We must enter by
   this Door, by breaking through nature, and by the exercise of virtue
   and humility, in meekness and patience. Know of a truth that he who
   entereth not in by this way goeth astray, and God goes before him and
   in him, and yet he remains blind. But none have power over those who
   enter by this way; for God Himself hath set them free. St Paul says,
   that those who are driven or led by the Spirit are under no law. Time
   is never too long for such men; nothing troubles them. It can never be
   said of any of the lovers of this world, that nothing troubles them,
   and that time is never too long. But they, who are in this world, but
   whose higher life is above, are freed from all things and patient in
   their lower life. Whatever comes, theirs is an essential peace. They
   take all things from God, and desire to lay all things again on Him;
   and thus they rest in peace. Still in the outer man they may have to
   suffer terribly and may be much troubled. But wherever they are, they
   are blessed; and we ought to praise them; but I fear they are rather
   sparsely sown. God help us that we may be like them. Amen.

  SERMON XXIV

      On the Feast of St Michael and All Angels

   On the various and especial works of the nine choirs of Holy Angels in
   man, in his threefold state and being; that is in the outer man, his
   powers of reason, and in his being, formed in the image of God. How, by
   their care and supervision, he may be enabled to attain to the very
   highest degree of Perfection in a spiritual life.

   Angeli corum semper vident faciem Patris mei, qui in coelis est

   "Their angels always see the Face of My Father Who is in heaven."

   To-day is the Feast of St Michael and all Angels. We have already read
   to-day how this festival first arose, in consequence of the revelation
   on the mountain; therefore we will not refer to that now. The Gospel
   says: "Their Angels do always behold the Face of My Father Who is in
   heaven." I know not with what words I can, or ought, to speak of these
   pure spirits, for they have neither hands nor feet, neither image, nor
   form, nor substance; neither can we understand the nature of their
   being; so how can we speak of them? We know not what they are; and that
   is not surprising, for we do not know ourselves, nor our souls by which
   we are made men, and from which we receive all that is good in us. How
   then can we understand these transcendent spirits, whose nobility far
   surpasses all the nobility that the world can show? Therefore let us
   discuss their behaviour towards us, and not the nature of their being.
   Their work is always to behold us, and to look upon us in the mirror of
   the Godhead regularly, effectually and truly, with discrimination; and
   they have a special and definite work to do in us; but God works
   unceasingly in us, much more truly and nobly; and they work with God in
   us, in the same way that the sun exercises a constant influence over
   the earth, while the stars co-operate with the sun in that influence on
   the earth, and on every creature in it. The stars always look at the
   sun and reflect his rays, while the sun turns his face to them; and
   thus their works become indivisible; so that, were it possible for the
   least star to be removed from the heavens, all creatures, men and
   cattle would be destroyed.

   Now, there are nine choirs of Angels, forming three hierarchies, in
   each of which there are three choirs. Now, these three hierarchies have
   each their own peculiar and different effect on the three parts of man.
   The first is the outer man, the second is his reason, and the third is
   his likeness to God; and yet all these three form one man. In all three
   the Angels have their work to do. And, besides this, every man has an
   Angel, who at his baptism was especially appointed to watch over him,
   into whose care he was committed, who stands by him, and helps him
   unceasingly, guarding him when sleeping and waking, in all places and
   in all his works and ways, whether evil or good. Were there nothing
   else for which we ought to love God dearly, and thank Him, surely this
   would be enough; that God has so closely united these exalted and
   invisible beings with us, that they may discipline us unceasingly. But,
   on the other hand, every man has also to deal with a peculiarly wicked
   angel, the Devil, who works against him unceasingly, and tries him as
   constantly as the good Angel. If we were wise and industrious, the
   Devil's opposition and his discipline would be more useful to us than
   those of the good Angels; for, were there no conflict, there could be
   no victory.

   Now we must speak of the hierarchies. The lowest of the hierarchies are
   called Angels; one with another they serve the outer man; they exhort
   and warn him, they help him and guide him towards that which is good;
   they watch over him with steady and constant discipline. If they did
   not thus watch over us, what innumerable evils do ye imagine, might not
   befall us? for numberless devils follow us perpetually, desiring to
   destroy us, either sleeping or waking. But these noble Angels
   anticipate them and prevent them.

   The Archangels form the second choir. They are represented as priest,
   whose active employment is to serve at the Holy Sacrament; they thus
   serve, counsel, and help man in the efficacious reception of the Holy
   Sacrament of our Lord's Body.

   The third choir consists of Virtues. They serve, counsel and admonish
   us to seek after natural and moral virtues, and they win for us the
   divine virtues of faith, hope and love. The men who follow them and
   commune much with them, are so virtuous that virtue becomes as easy and
   pleasant to them, as though it were part of their very nature and
   being. All the enemies, who have fallen from this choir, set themselves
   with all imaginable cunning against these men, desiring to entice them
   away, so that they may not reach that place, from which they themselves
   have been cast out. The stratagems to which they constantly have
   recourse, are incredible. Man ought to be very diligent in keeping
   guard against the hostile wickedness, which so marvellously surrounds
   him; for these enemies often make use of much secret dexterity in
   things which seem good; and, for the most part, they strive to lead men
   into all kinds of diversions; and, when they find they are not
   succeeding, they place him in a position which seems good, that he may
   be content therewith, and may not strive to advance. Now, this is a
   most perilous condition in which to find ourselves, and now more than
   it ever was. As St Bernard says: "To stand still in the way of God, is
   to go backwards." All are in this condition who have worldly and
   self-satisfied hearts, and who say, "We do as many good works as other
   men, and we are well-pleased with ourselves; we shall fare better than
   they, and we will go on with our own ways and customs, as those did who
   were before us." But when great plagues come, those who imagine now
   that they are doing well will seem to be in great misery. Then the
   wicked angels, whom they have followed, will wonder and lament with
   them, and finally lead them away unopposed. Cases such as these are
   taking place even now. But when these horrible downfalls and plagues
   have passed away, then the holy Angels will make themselves known to
   men who have been purified, and will walk with them and commune with
   them openly.

   Now we come to the second hierarchy. The Angels of which it is composed
   here an active supervision over the second division of man's nature;
   his reasoning powers, which place him far above all other creatures
   with animal nature, and make him like unto the Angels. The first choir
   is called Potestates, the second Principatus, and the third
   Dominationes, signifying the mighty, the princes and the rulers. All
   these work in men, who, they find, have progressed in virtue, so that
   they can control, both outwardly and inwardly, their senses and the
   outward expression of them, in all things; and in the inner man, their
   thoughts and intentions. These men are free and reign supreme over
   vice. Thus, we read of St Francis, that he had such power over the
   outer man, that directly he thought of some discipline, his body sprang
   forward, and said, "See, here am I." Such men are truly like the
   princes of the world, who are free and have none to control them. Thus
   these men are enabled in spirit to rule over all the actions of the
   outer and inner man. When the wicked angels see this, they are filled
   with vehement hatred against them, because they fear that these men
   will take their places. So they exercise all their ingenuity to bring
   them into the most awful temptations that can be conceived, and of
   which those who serve the world and the Evil One never heard nor
   imagined. Of these ways there are many, for they so earnestly desire to
   drag down the good. When they become so importunate that the poor man
   imagines he must lose either his life or his senses, then the noble
   Angels come, the Principatus, and drive them away, and the man has
   gained the victory. When they have been thus overcome, they never dare
   to attack the same man again; for they are too proud to do it; and they
   are terrified and give way before these powerful people, and before
   those who rule over this hierarchy. Then the rulers, Dominationes, come
   and enable these men to become so wise and prudent, that they can see
   through the stratagems of the enemy. At St Paul says, that neither the
   devil, the world, the flesh, nor any creature could gain a victory over
   him.

   We now come to the third hierarchy; these Angels work and look into the
   innermost part of man; into that which was formed in the Image of God.
   The first choir of these is formed by the Thrones, the second by the
   Cherubim, and the third by the Seraphim.

   The Thrones work in the innermost heart of man, so that he becomes like
   unto a kingly throne, where God delights to dwell, to reign and to
   judge, to reward and to work all His works in him and through him.
   These men's hearts are so irrevocably rooted in Divine Peace, that
   neither love nor sorrow, severity nor tenderness, can disturb them; as
   St Paul has said: "Neither death nor life." A hundred deaths would not
   move or terrify such men. In the same way that a dying man cares
   nothing for all the honour or shame that could be heaped upon him,
   because his thoughts are elsewhere, so also, when a man in his
   innermost heart is turned to God, he is a strong Throne of God, nothing
   can affright him, neither love nor sorrow, for he rests in that
   essential peace, which is the Dwelling-place of God; as David says: "In
   pace factus est locus ejus." Preserve and guard peace, dear children,
   that no man take it from thee, and that the Dwelling-place of God may
   not be destroyed. O, dear child, preserve this, be silent, suffer,
   abstain from evil and rest in peace. Rest and trust and keep to
   thyself; do not run about too much; be not agitated, preoccupied or
   impulsive; but realise the Presence of thy Lord of Lords in thy heart,
   where He sits on His throne glorious and powerful, so that He may not
   be disturbed and His peace diminished.

   Now, when men are resting in this peace, then the Cherubim come in all
   their brightness, and lighten up men's hearts with their godlike light
   as with a sudden glance. This glance pierces the men through and
   through; and their hearts are so filled with light, that, were it
   necessary, they could judge all men; and yet this illumination is but a
   glance; the quicker it is, the truer, the nobler and the surer.

   Then come the burning Seraphim, with their flaming love, and they
   kindle love in the hearts of men; and this, too, is done in a moment,
   so that the love of man becomes so broad and wide that it embraces
   within itself the love of all things. It seems to him as though he
   would set all men alight; and all is so sudden and quick, that it seems
   to him as though he would be consumed himself. This flame is kindled in
   the innermost thoughts of the glorified man; and yet it lights up also
   the other two parts of man, his soul and the outer man. Such men become
   so godlike and so well-regulated, so truly resigned, virtuous, peaceful
   and calm, that no one is ever conscious of any infirmity in them,
   either i words or deeds; and yet they look upon themselves as nothing,
   and heed all as little as if it had taken place in some one a thousand
   miles away. They look upon all that God may work by them, or in them,
   as apart from themselves, taking no credit for it; for they think of
   nothing but their own absolute nothingness, and regard themselves as
   lower than all men. These verily are the heavens in which the Father
   dwells, as the Gospel says: "Their Angels always see the Face of My
   Father Who is in heaven." May God help us all thus to attain. Amen.

  SERMON XXV

      All Saints' Day

   A very useful exposition of the Gospel, of the eight Beatitudes. How we
   can attain to the grades or steps of these most blessed Virtues, and
   learn to know ourselves thereby. How we ought to honour the Saints and
   their various degrees of merit in the Eternal Fatherland.

   Videns Jesus turbas, ascendit in montem, et secuti sunt cum discipuli,
   etc.

   "And seeing the multitudes Jesus went up into a mountain, and when He
   was set down, His disciples came unto Him. And opening His mouth, he
   taught them saying: Blessed are the poor in spirit," and thus He spake
   the eight Beatitudes.

   The mountain that Jesus went up was His own holiness and His Being, for
   He is one with His Father; and He was followed by a great company of
   those dear Saints whose day we are celebrating. They have all followed
   Him, each one in his own vocation, as God has called him. We must
   follow after them, endeavouring above all things to discover what the
   calling is, to which God has called us, and to follow it.

   Now, we must honour these Saints with all diligence. What is the
   greatest honour that we can do them? To sink down with them in absolute
   seclusion, in that good ground in which they have lost themselves, and
   in which their great blessedness is to be found. Therefore, immerse
   thyself with them, for thou canst not show them any greater honour, or
   do anything that would please them better.

   Now let us consider the company of Saints who followed Him up the
   mountain, and how each one was led. Now, He was first followed by the
   holy Patriarchs of the Old Covenant with overflowing longings; for they
   believed that He would come. They were filled by God with holy love and
   hope; and, not outwardly but inwardly, they were bare and empty of all
   that was not God. Their love was so great, that they divided all they
   had with the chosen people; and they used all diligence, that nothing
   should be wanting whence this Birth should proceed. They offered
   themselves up entirely to the service of that generation, into which He
   was to be born. We read to-day of those who followed Him, that, of
   every generation, twelve thousand were marked; eleven generations
   followed Him and the rest were numberless.

   Next came the second company, the dear and holy Apostles. They came
   after the Birth of our Lord; and they were led by Him by a much higher
   way, and to a state of greater perfection. They forsook all things, not
   only inwardly, but also outwardly, in true poverty of body and soul,
   and that in the highest degree possible.

   Then came the holy Martyrs, and of these a great company followed Him.
   They not only forsook all things, but they also laid down their lives
   when God required it of them, and in whatever way He chose.

   Then He was followed by a great company of holy Confessors, who
   followed their call in divers ways. Some lived alone unto God in
   seclusion, and received the truth within, in silence, and listening to
   what God, the Eternal Word, spake unto them. Such men fled to the woods
   and caves. Others joined religious Orders, and lived in Holy
   Christendom, preaching and writing, hearing confessions, teaching and
   admonishing, doing all things heartily, as unto God, and giving up self
   and all that was not of God.

   Then followed the blessed company of pure and modest Virgins, undefiled
   in body and soul. Oh! what a holy and blessed thing it is to be found
   undefiled in body like an Angel, and to whom God has granted the honour
   of being found in the garb which He and His Blessed Mother wore with
   such grace. The joy is so great that no one in this world ought to be
   able to trouble such a man; neither should sorrow or any trouble go to
   his heart, if he has only preserved this treasure. He, who desires to
   preserve it in all its nobility, must struggle and suffer; and his
   heart will often be wounded by his natural desires and his evil nature,
   the flesh and the devil. Now mark, children, every attack, made by
   temptations of this nature only brings forth purity; he, who thus
   learns to know himself therein, will find that this is his reward. O,
   children, who gives heed to the rewards thus brought forth! Then comes
   the company of the common people, who give heed to such things; they
   are also upheld by the faith and prayer of the Friends of God. They
   must be purified in purgatory, or else they cannot enter into the
   Kingdom of the Father; and, as we keep to-day as the day of the souls
   that are purified, so we shall keep to-morrow, as the day of the souls
   that are not, that they also may be purified. Thus, for one earthly
   delight, and one daily sin, we shall have to suffer more pain in
   purgatory than the pain of all the martyrs, could it be heaped
   together, whose day we are keeping. This must needs be for the
   slightest opposing of our will to God in sin, and for despising His
   call and His mediation.

   Now these are the companies who followed Christ up the mountain of His
   Blessedness. Then He opened His Divine Mouth and spake the eight
   Beatitudes. We will say a little about each one. He said first:
   "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."
   This virtue is placed first, because it is the chief part, and the
   beginning of all perfection. Children, turn it which way ye will, the
   heart of man must be bare, empty, free, poor, and undisturbed, if God
   is really to work therein. It must be quite empty, and then God may and
   will dwell therein.

   Now this poverty may be accepted and exercised in four different ways.
   The first are those who are poor against their own will and wish. No
   one ought to judge harshly of these poor; for the Lord overlook their
   faults all the more graciously on account of their poverty.

   St Thomas says of the second kind of poverty, that it is to be desired
   and accepted to the same extent in which we find it a help to us, and a
   furtherance of the freedom and emptiness of our minds; for many a man's
   mind is freer and less preoccupied what is needful, then when he is
   obliged to provide it every day. He, who is allowed to possess what is
   needful, and uses it with thankfulness, is often less anxious than he
   who has to seek it. But, if such a man should find that it has taken
   possession of his heart, or that it disturbs him, so that he is not
   exercising the virtues of charity, moderation, humility and absolute
   purity, he ought to give all up, and become poor outwardly, like the
   poor.

   The third kind of poverty is that of one who so dearly loves God, that
   nothing can hinder him, and everything becomes a help to him. As St
   Paul says, all things are a help to the good; so this man remains
   unaffected by everything that is not absolutely of God, by everything
   that touches his heart, so that he may become poor, bare and free.
   These can say with St. Paul: "As having nothing and yet possessing all
   things." so the inner man is unharmed.

   The fourth kind of this absolute poverty is that of a man who desires
   to be poor, both outwardly and inwardly, after the example of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who imitates His absolute poverty out of real love,
   neither troubled by it nor concealing it, either outwardly or inwardly.
   Such only have a bare, pure, direct and unceasing intercourse with
   their Source and Beginning, so that there cannot be a sudden falling
   away without the heart being aware of it and returning speedily. This
   is the most absolute poverty; for the most noble form of poverty is a
   turning to God, bare, free and unhindered, now and for ever, like that
   of the poor Saints.

   Now we come to the second: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall posses
   the land." Here we come a degree nearer in blessedness; for all
   difficulties are solved by true poverty; for by this meekness we get
   closer to the Source of all things, and all bitterness, anger and
   untruthfulness are driven out; for it is written: "All things are clean
   to the clean," to the meek all things are pure. All this comes out of a
   pure, good heart, so that to the good all things are good. In days gone
   by the Friends of God were martyred, prepared (tortured) and tormented
   by the heathen; but now it is done by people who appear to be good
   Christians; they cut us to the heart, and yet they are our neighbours.
   If thou turnest to God, they say: "Thou art mad; thou hast lost thy
   head; thou hast strange customs, and thou art a deceiver." Then comes
   meekness, and leads and guides thee to thyself in thine own heart, that
   thou mayest receive all as from God, and not from man. Thus thou
   remainest in perfect peace, and sayest: "What can man do to harm thee,
   if thou hast God for thy Friend?" and thus the meek possess the land,
   and remain in perfect peace, in spite of all that may befall them. But
   if thou dost not act thus, thou wilt lose all thy virtue and thy peace
   as well; and thou wilt be called a snarler, as though thou wert a
   fierce dog.

   Thirdly, our Lord said: "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be
   comforted." In one sense He means those who suffer; in another sense,
   those who mourn for their sins, always excepting the blessed Friends of
   God, who are the most blessed of all here; for they have done with
   weeping for their own sins, and may not mourn for them any more; and
   yet they have not ceased weeping, for they weep for the sins and
   infirmities of their neighbours. We read that St Dominic asked one of
   his companions, who was weeping bitterly, why he wept. He replied:
   "Dear father, because of my sins." Then said the Saint: "No, dear son,
   they have been sufficiently mourned for; but I beseech thee, dear son,
   to weep for those who will not weep for themselves." Thus the true
   Friends of God weep for all the blindness and misery of the sins of the
   world, and for all its wickedness. For when God allows His anger and
   His judgments to fall upon us, and we say so many dreadful things about
   the fire, the floods, the great darkness, strong winds and bad times,
   then the Saints mourn over all before the Lord, day and night; and He
   regardeth them and ceaseth, waiting to see if we will do better. If we
   do not improve, we must expect yet heavier and severer plagues. The
   clouds hang over us; but they are held up by the weeping of the Friends
   of God. But, be sure of this, if we do not improve, they will soon
   fall; and then there will be such tumults and turmoils that we shall be
   put in mind of the Judgment Day. Those who are now at peace will suffer
   from great oppression, and the Word of God and Divine Service will
   become almost unknown. There will only be a service here or there, and
   no one will know where to go. But our faithful God will find a place of
   refuge, where He can preserve His own. [28]

   Fourthly: "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for justice." This,
   in truth, is a virtue which has been possessed by very few men. Very
   few hunger and desire, in thought, sight and taste, for righteousness
   only. There would be neither favour nor disfavour, either for my
   benefit or for that of my friends, nor for my honour, praise, or blame;
   there would be neither false judgment, favour or disfavour, where this
   ground was found; but he who finds it may well be praised. For he to
   whom nothing is delightful, and who cares for nothing but justice, has
   ascended to a very high degree. We may well say to such an one that he
   is blessed.

   Fifthly: "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." It is
   said that mercy is the attribute that God shows forth in all His works:
   therefore a merciful man is a truly godlike man. For mercy is brought
   forth by love and kindness. Therefore the true Friends of God are much
   more merciful, and more ready to believe in the sinful and suffering,
   than those who are not loving. Mercy is born of that love which we
   ought to exercise towards each other. If we do not, God will require it
   of us at the Judgment Day; and, where He findeth not the requisite
   mercy, He will refuse mercy, as He Himself has said. He says nothing of
   perfection, and censures only those who have not been merciful. This
   mercy is not concerned only with gifts, but it ought to extend to all
   the suffering that falls, or may fall, on a man when tried. He who does
   not look on his neighbour with true love and pity, mercifully
   overlooking all his weakness and infirmity, may well fear for himself,
   that God will refuse him His mercy. "With what measure you mete, it
   shall be measured to you again." Therefore let every one look to
   himself, that he may himself be uncondemned throughout Eternity.

   Sixthly: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
   Children of God." Men, who possess true peace, are lovable men indeed,
   and their peace no man taketh from them. Their own will is lost in the
   Will of God, in love and sorrow, weal or woe, in time and in Eternity.
   Their works and all their life are in God, not after a human fashion,
   but in a divine and supernatural way. They are baptized in the Power of
   the Father, the Wisdom of the Son, and the precious love of the Holy
   Ghost, and they are so saturated therewith, that no man can mar their
   peace. These three Divine Persons has so filled them, that, were it
   needful, they could make their peace known throughout the land; for
   they are filled with the light of the Divine Wisdom which has passed
   through them. Thus, full of love also themselves, they overflow, both
   within and without, in true love to their neighbours. Thus overflowing,
   nothing else can be found in them, however they may be approached, but
   love and peace. These are they who at heart are peace-makers. The peace
   which passeth all understanding has taken such hold of them, that none
   can drive away; and they are rightly called the Children of God; for
   that which the Only-Begotten Son has by nature, is given to them of
   grace. The peaceful are in very truth begotten to God and of His Heart;
   for this peace cannot otherwise be brought forth, either by discipline
   or by any outward means. Still, those in whom this peace is to be
   found, may have to suffer many offenses, in the outer man, in many
   ways.

   Seventhly: "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God."
   What is a clean heart? A heart bare, free and untroubled by any
   creature, where God finds the ground bare, free and untroubled. The
   pure shall indeed see God. This purity of heart is defiled by man, when
   he wantonly turns with heart and desire to the creature, and rests
   therein; and, the more he rests and seeks and finds in that which is
   not God, the more he separates himself from God. Thus his eyes are
   blinded and he cannot rest in the Vision of God. The external purity of
   the flesh is very helpful to the purity of the heart; as St Paul says:
   "Virgins think day and night, unceasingly, of the things of God, but
   they that have husbands cannot do this." As bodily purity is lost by
   the outward neglect of the body, so also the noble integrity of the
   spirit in the Likeness of God is lost and spoiled by the willing
   addition of things that are not in His Likeness; so that by this means
   man's spirit is darkened, and he cannot see his Source nor his true
   Abode, nor that for which he was created and sent forth; namely, that
   he should unceasingly return to his Source and there see God with the
   eyes of his spirit and his understanding. Therefore, purity is much to
   be praised, because it ever provides an open pathway to God; for the
   spouse of God should so keep herself that she should desire to please
   none but God only; that is, if she desires to be, or to be called His
   spouse.

   It is impossible to express in words the eighth Beatitude, that those
   are blessed who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake. The
   faithful and true God, who has chosen that His Friends should be very
   near to Him in His own blessedness, sends speedy and great suffering,
   when He sees that they are not living as befits them; so that they may
   follow after blessedness whether they will or no. This is immeasurable
   faithfulness on the part of God, and it ought to be the cause of
   immeasurable thankfulness on the part of man, that he is thus obliged
   to suffer. He ought to acknowledge that he is unworthy of it; and it
   should fill him with hope that God has granted him this honour and
   grace, that he may be made like unto God and follow after Him. St
   Bernard says: "a little suffering borne patiently is far and away of
   greater worth than long discipline is good works." St Thomas says: "All
   suffering, however slight, that can be suffered either outwardly or
   inwardly, is a copy of the most precious Suffering of our Lord."

   But a still more worthy suffering, and closer to that of our Lord, is
   an inner suffering with God; for though all suffering is incredibly
   useful and fruitful, yet this is still more desirable and noble. As
   high and far above all creatures as God is, so is this suffering high
   and far above all the works that man can do. Therefore we ought to love
   God very dearly, when He leads us to eternal salvation by means of
   suffering with Him. The work must be God's and not man's, and we must
   see God in it. Man ought by nature to suffer rather than to work; to
   receive rather than give; for every such gift increases and ennobles
   the desire for more gifts a thousand times. He who empties himself and
   makes himself bare, and holds himself in inner peace, looking for the
   work of God in his soul, will give place to God, and desire to bear all
   that God may work in him, in His noble and divine work. For God is
   always working, and His Spirit is always suffering. What a marvellous
   fast to his nobility, and, under God, keep himself bare and pure; so
   that God, if it pleased Him, might see His work in man. God grant that
   we may attain to this blessedness. Amen.

  SERMON XXVI

      All Saints' Day

      The Second Sermon

   Of two kinds of Poverty; the lack of worldly goods, and Poverty of
   Spirit. How Poverty of Spirit is the much more perfect kind; more
   painful and also more pleasing to God. Of what Poverty of Spirit
   consists, and how man can attain to it.

   Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum ist regnum coelorum.

   "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."

   There are two kinds of poverty; one is external, affecting the outer
   man, and consists of giving up all temporal things for the sake of God,
   and this is an Evangelical Counsel. The other kind of poverty is that
   of the spirit and humility of heart. This is required of all men: of
   each man according to his vocation; and now we will say something of
   both kinds.

   The first kind of poverty is not binding on every man, but only on
   those who are called thereto by God, and to whose spirit the desire is
   given to imitate, in the highest degree, the outward Humanity of
   Christ. To do this they must forsake all things, and must give even
   themselves in alms; begging their bread day by day, like St Francis and
   all his brethren. Thus to follow after Christ outwardly is the highest
   grade. No man can attain to this in his own strength; for he will have
   to give up all temporal advantages absolutely, to deny himself
   outwardly all temporal goods. Nature does not willingly act thus, for
   it is hard; but the more difficult it is to nature, the more acceptable
   it is to God. It is a peculiarly holy life to those who walk therein,
   with pure hearts and good intentions; and by means of their good
   example, God often brings about the conversion of many worldly people,
   especially amongst the poor who are living in great sin. Therefore this
   poverty is greatly rewarded by God. But, if this outward poverty is to
   work for their real good, it must also take place inwardly. For this
   reason outward poverty is most useful when it becomes a help to inner
   poverty.

   The second kind of poverty is that of the spirit, and real humility of
   heart. It consists of the resignation of all comforts and pleasures;
   and, as outward poverty requires that all temporal comfort should be
   forsaken, so this points to the forsaking of all inner consolation, in
   virtue, fervour, and all the pleasures of inward cheerfulness and joy.

   Now, dear children, try to understand me aright, how ye ought to attain
   to this. May God grant that ye will desire this poverty, and also that
   which is external. He will not succeed who sets himself to acquire it
   without any inner inclination; or takes it on himself, because he has
   read of it in the Scriptures, or heard of it, or lays hold of it out of
   anxiety. He who is not driven thereto by divine inspiration, will stand
   still, and will not attain to true virtue. He thinks only of externals,
   of the state of willing poverty, but he does not look upon it as Christ
   did, and as He calls some men thereto, who fill the highest place in
   the Holy Church, and who, for God's sake, first became outwardly poor,
   that they might become inwardly poor also. Some think only of the state
   of outward poverty, and do not look within. They are quite content with
   outward poverty; for they think everything depends upon that; if at
   times inner fervour and a sweet foretaste are theirs, they call it
   contemplation, or the contemplative life. Now all this is still taking
   place in the lowest grade of their nature, according to the integrity
   and spirituality of their lowest powers; and so they do not look any
   further within, but they imagine there is no higher way. Thus they
   become only a little like unto Christ in His Humanity; but they ought
   to go further, and learn to be like unto Christ in spirit and in truth.
   As He was united in spirit with the Father, so also must they strive to
   be, as far as possible, in this life.

   Inner poverty is a much higher state than outward poverty, because it
   is in the Likeness of God, while the latter only resembles His
   Humanity. It is also much safer. He who possesses both is the most
   exalted. But there are not many such men to be found; for people are
   much diseased by nature; and, therefore, if one or the other must be
   lacking, it is better to lack outward poverty, and to seek inward
   poverty, according to the power of each man, in whatever state he may
   be. A poor and humble heart is needful for all men; but every man is
   not bound to be outwardly poor, but only those who are called by God
   thereto. This inner way and poverty are hard to follow; and if a man
   could have as much strength as the strongest man who ever lived, he
   would need it all to enable him to endure to the end of his life. Is it
   not then quite right that such men should have outward comforts and
   proper attention when they are ill, especially those who have long
   tormented the outer man? It is, however, so difficult to carry this
   out, that they will not be able to succeed well by casting off all
   necessaries, by watchings, by hard external labour; for they are rather
   hindered by severe and external abstinence. When they are suffering,
   oppressed, in terror, or in severe pain, their hearts are so full, that
   they can scarcely bear all; and, if then they were to do severe outward
   penance, they would destroy their natural powers, and would be unable
   to attend to God's inner admonitations; therefore, when they are in
   this condition, proper attention should be allowed them, that they may
   get better. Be sure of this, that they will have to do penance for the
   comforts allowed to nature, with fear and trembling, though outwardly
   they may hold high positions in the world, having goods and possessions
   in accordance with their rank, and yet still possessing this inner
   poverty. The more these people have of external honour, goods and ease,
   in accordance with their rank, the heavier is the load they bear
   within; while outwardly they are obliged to do their utmost to foster
   this poverty of spirit. When they cannot accomplish this without
   natural comforts, they make use of them in fear and bitterness, as
   secretly as they can, so that they may offend none. Thus any one might
   possess a kingdom without injury to himself; or any other position, and
   yet be poor in spirit and miserable. Very few are ready to believe that
   such great benefits may thus be gained, yea, in every state of life, if
   man be only ready to die to his natural lusts, and to turn will all his
   heart to this poverty. None are too rich, or too great, or too poor, to
   attain to this way, to choose it and to walk therein; all who earnestly
   seek it can find it. Therefore, the man who is unable to accept both
   kinds of poverty should turn to this one, stay in his calling, and
   learn to be poor in spirit, that is of a humble heart.

   The best way to train ourselves in this, is to call upon God for help,
   beseeching Him to preserve us from sin, and to grant us endurance in
   suffering; for poverty of spirit consists of inward suffering,
   oppression and misery. It may not be driven out by any pleasure. Man
   must exercise himself in all virtues, in as much as it lies in his
   power; and, if he is not pleased, but more suffering comes from other
   people, and he is chastised by God, and afflicted in his body, while
   all men, both clergy and laity, disconcert, scorn and despise him;
   while in all this, he suffers and does not give way, but waits till God
   sends him relief; see, this is being poor in spirit. Now mark, how much
   harder it is to choose this inner poverty than lack of goods. It is
   truly much more pleasing to God and much nobler. Those who preach and
   teach this inner poverty, are doing God much more service than those
   who teach external poverty only. This life is far more like unto God
   than the other; and many hundred times more labour is required in it.
   It would also be better to induce a hundred men to follow after poverty
   of spirit, than one to endure outward poverty. It does not need much
   proof to show that this is a far higher life than the first; for it is
   so much harder to choose it. That men are more easily moved by outward
   poverty arises from the fact that they believe more readily what they
   see, than what they hear of, and have not tried. God wills that some
   men should choose external poverty, because the life is well-pleasing
   to Him, and that they may have much fruit amongst the common people,
   who cannot understand poverty of spirit, because they are so full of
   care, and who regard outward poverty as the most excellent state. It
   teaches and moves them to turn from their own most sinful life and to
   repent.

   Those who love external poverty, and exercise themselves therein, are
   sometimes richly endowed by God with spiritual riches within. No
   suffering vexes them outwardly, because they are so joyful in spirit.
   Some think it almost an impossibility, when they hear that they ought
   to turn from these delights. They consider that external poverty is of
   small account; they think more of inner poverty, because they really
   love themselves too well, and act thus that they may be able to follow
   the dictates of nature, while they think or imagine that they wish to
   serve God in pure joyfulness. This is verily and indeed true of those
   who, not having been compelled and urged from within, flee from outward
   poverty; thus they are constantly deceived and become very dangerous
   people. But those who have tasted it, and who strive to live in pain
   and who go straight on in their course, in true resignation, will find
   it much more painful than the other course could ever have been; and,
   had they the strength of ten men, they would find it useful. It is
   necessary that they should eat and drink well, so that they may not
   suffer from headache; for our nature is not so strong and powerful as
   it used to be; and they cannot follow, both in the outer and inner way,
   without especial grace from God. But let him who is admonished by God
   to take the first way, walk in it with the help of God; and then,
   doubtless, help will be given him for the other, so that he can turn to
   it with all his might, and thus follow on in both. But if he cannot
   follow on in both, let him keep to the second for the present, and let
   him destroy and kill his sins only, and not his nature. He, who is not
   called to the first, should turn and pray for the second, that he may
   fear God in his own state of life; for with God there is no respect of
   persons, but He loves and is well-pleased with all who fear Him and are
   pious.

   Now, may the merciful God help us to serve Him in such a righteous
   life, forsaking our sins and all the lusts of the flesh, and the
   sweetness of spirituality, that we may attain to true poverty of
   spirit. All sorts and conditions of men are called hereto. First and
   foremost the clergy, and especially the priests, as is shown by the
   life of John the Baptist, who led a hard and strict life, and deprived
   himself outwardly of all that he could possibly give up. He also
   possessed true poverty of spirit, that is deep and true humility,
   despising the body, and holding himself of no repute in comparison with
   the Lord Jesus; for he said: "The latchet of Whose shoe I am not worthy
   to unloose." He also said: "I ought to be baptized by Thee, and comest
   Thou to me?" Thus it was quite evident that he was despised and
   rejected of men; for Christ tells us that, because he ate and drank so
   little, some of them said: "He hath a devil." And at last it came to
   pass, that for the truth's sake he was beheaded in the dungeon, and
   thus murdered secretly, just as though he did not belong to God; for he
   had no visible spiritual consolations, but he suffered death patiently.
   This is also shown in the life of the holy Pope Gregory, who has less
   comfort in the inner and outer man from all his riches and honour, than
   a hermit has in his cell. This is also proved to all women and laymen
   by the example of our Blessed Lady, who had no temporal consolations.
   And Christ is our Example above all, for He was outwardly poor, and
   still poorer in spirit; and, from the Manger to the Cross, He never
   experienced any comfort. Thus all His disciples and Saints have
   followed after Him, each one in his hard and suffering life, according
   to his power, and as God has decreed. God grant that we also may attain
   to this, and may come to a perfect life. Amen.

  SERMON XXVII

      All Saints' Day, or St Ursula's Day

      The Third Sermon

   How man can attain to the Purity of Heart which will enable him to see
   God in this life, to be sensible of His Divine Inspiration, and
   hereafter to possess and enjoy Him for ever.

   Beati mundo corde, quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt

   "Blessed are the clean of heart for they shall see God."

   Mark well, dear children, how all those who desire to be pleasing unto
   God, must be cleansed from all outer and inner stains and blemishes,
   for otherwise God will not accept them, but will let them perish in
   many outer and inner errors.

   He who would gladly be freed from sin, and who desires to possess a
   pure and empty heart, free from anxiety, with which, even in this life,
   in spirit he may see God, must seek the Grace of God; and must, before
   all things, examine his conscience diligently, that he may learn to
   cleanse it, by dying to all the vices of which he was ever guilty,
   either outwardly or inwardly. Now what is a good conscience? It is a
   quiet, peaceful, pure heart, humble and lowly, which desires God's Will
   and Honour, and is ready to give or receive all things, without making
   any choice; he who has such a heart will be blessed, and the Will of
   God will be done by him. But before a man can attain to this, so that
   his conscience is pure, empty and quiet, he will have to go through
   great suffering; and his conscience will be constantly pricking and
   gnawing him. First, he acknowledges the greatness of his sins, which he
   mourns and repents. Then he begins to shun and avoid evil, and to
   resist sin and all that causes it; so that he may learn to die unto it,
   that he may be clean and no longer consent to it. After this he begins
   to do good, and to set his face against all wanton desires of the
   senses, even giving up things which are allowed (as David did), in
   eating and drinking, walking and standing, seeing and hearing, walking
   and resting in many things that are permissible, in order that he may
   grow better, and follow the teaching of the Gospel. Therefore, those
   things in which he has taken great delight, and in which he has
   indulged, he must subdue and repress. By this means conscience learns
   how to purify the desires, as before it had striven to guard against
   gross sins.

   After this the outer man suffers great discomfort which the body can
   ill bear. When man has succeeded, by the Grace of God, in cutting off
   gross sins, and has begun to get the mastery over his spirit, by
   cutting himself off from all his accustomed pleasures, it seems strange
   to his animal nature, which begins to struggle. Then, whether he take
   it amiss, or simply, plainly and patiently, yet he will find that he is
   ill at ease, and full of infirmity, and that his ill-ordered mind will
   not submit to guidance. He cannot keep his senses outwardly under
   control; he cannot keep silence, but must talk, either to complain of
   his wants, or to boast of his good works. He finds fault with all that
   he does not like, and casts aside everything to which he is averse. He
   complains of all that harms him, while anything, which is advantageous,
   pleases him. That which is sweet is also pleasant; while he is
   unwilling to accept any task that is hard and difficult. All that he
   praises must be praised; while no one may praise, in his presence,
   anything with which he finds fault. See, dear children, how a man thus
   begins to fathom and to probe his own heart, and to realise what he is,
   and what he can do of himself. He earnestly desires to drive some evil
   things out of his heart, and to purify it; but it is sour and hard to
   him. His nature can as yet scarcely bear suffering, mortification and
   oppression and shame, though on account of many things he is
   conscience-stricken and repentant, and acknowledges before God and man
   that he has not done right in these things. Because he does not yet
   know what it is to die to all evil desires, he may easily fall a prey
   to them; and not without cause; for evil desires lie hidden at the
   bottom of his heart, to which he is outwardly so much inclined, that it
   is most needful he should exercise himself, in the outer man, in the
   virtues shown forth by our Lord Jesus Christ, while he shares those
   things to which he is inclined.

   After this the man begins to be more spiritually-minded, in a fruitful
   and virtuous life; he must begin with a fervent prayer, which must
   arise from his conflict with sin, as has already been said. Further,
   true penitence and sorrow for sin arise from such prayers; then
   contempt of self and his sinful life, and then the man begins with good
   will to yield himself up to suffer pain, mortification, oppression,
   contradiction and ignominy and all kinds of trouble in which he may
   find himself, while in all he gives and offers himself up to God. He
   begins out of love to learn true resignation and patience in the faith
   and hope of Christ. He will have nothing more of self, that the purity
   of his conscience may in no way be stained. He then begins to hate
   himself, and despise himself, while he endeavours to guard against all
   judging of others, and strives to shut out all sin when he becomes
   aware of temptation. He diligently guards against all incitements to
   sin, so that he may not give place to the Devil. He hangs on God with
   all his heart, and cleaves to nothing else. He patiently suffers to the
   end all the suffering that comes to him, till God releases him. He will
   not seek for ease by means of any comfort, either bodily or spiritual.
   The consequence of all this is, that he is willing to be guided by his
   superiors, desiring to subject himself wholly unto God. He first
   notices what is present to him, and then exercises himself therein. If
   it is good, he is thankful; if he is tempted, he fights against it.
   Further, he learns that he must bewail his need to none, save God, to
   Whom he prays for perseverance. He is never uplifted by anything on
   earth, and has no pleasure in self; but he delights only in God, in all
   things, and above all things. He is thankful and good tempered, whether
   things go well or ill with him. He loves his neighbours, feeling pity
   for their weakness, and shuns all external things and all sudden
   outbursts, especially in mirth. He avoids all lukewarmness in
   discipline and excess of pleasure. All that belongs to God is good;
   therefore man should be careful in keeping watch over himself, not
   high-minded but thinking little of self. Everything that he advises
   another to shun, he must shun himself, such as self-will, of which
   especially he must rid himself. He must strive to build on his
   imperfection and littleness, offering himself in all his suffering to
   God, and bearing always the Life and Sufferings of Christ in his heart.
   He will cling to no creature, that God alone may be his Love and his
   Lover. He purifies his heart that he may learn to see God here in
   truth, and that he may see Him yet more purely and more clearly in
   eternal salvation. God grant that this may be our portion. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SERMON XXVIII

      On the Feast of the Holy Virgin, St Catherine

   Of the great advantage and fruitfulness to which we may attain, if we
   diligently meditate on, and exercise ourselves in, the Sufferings of
   Christ. This may well be compared to a costly Pearl, which devout
   virgins ought to seek everywhere diligently, to buy and to possess.

   Inventa una preciosa margarita, abiit et vendidit universa quae habuit,
   et emit eam.

   "And when he had found one pearl of great price, he went his way and
   sold all that he had and bought it."

   She found a costly pearl, and therefore forsook everything, and parted
   with all her goods that she might buy it. We may understand by this
   that the virgin of God has forsaken all things for the sake of her
   purity, which she prizes like a precious stone, and that she has
   preserved that only. Secondly, the virgin of Christ has found the
   Sufferings of Christ, and has copied them, withdrawing from all earthly
   pleasures, to thank Him for this suffering.

   The simplest way in which we can serve God consists of two things. The
   first is the ordinary discipline of the Holy Church, and a life spent
   in subjection, in poverty, in purity and in other good practices, such
   as were undertaken by the holy and gifted dwellers in monasteries. This
   is a safe and good thing to do, in order to subdue the outer man, and
   to turn to virtue.

   The second point is, that we should exercise ourselves in imitating the
   Sufferings of our Lord; endeavouring once every day to consider them
   fully, and, as far as possible, to compare, in all points, our lives
   with His, noticing, especially, all that God sends us, to which we must
   submit, following after God. If we watch carefully, we shall find that
   God, in His great and loving mercy, will unceasingly send us so much
   trouble, that we shall not be able to exalt ourselves, or make
   ourselves equal with God. We must meditate on all this suffering,
   learning and working with all our hearts, and in all our work, striving
   to do all things to the glory of God. We must also strive to gain such
   control over our senses, that, in a short time, the love of the world
   will be quite extinguished in us. Thus the suffering of Christ may well
   be compared to the precious stone or pearl, which a virgin of Christ
   preserves, that she may adorn herself therewith. She must meditate
   every day on the Sufferings of Christ, from the Last Supper to the
   Resurrection, and she must buy that pearl with all that she has and can
   gather together, in all her works, her thankfulness and longings.
   Herewith we ought to be able easily to overcome all the evil
   inclinations of our nature and our evil thoughts; herewith we ought
   soon to arrive at a heartfelt acknowledgement of our own weakness and
   infirmities, and to attain to deep humility; and thus go on to an
   inner, perfect sympathy with our Lord, and all men, in true love. He
   who does not turn to this, can never really learn to know himself, but
   he will probably remain outside, content with outward observances. Even
   though he forced himself onwards through outward things and work, yet
   all cannot sweeten him within unless he earnestly repents.

   Good fruits proceed from these pearls of the Sufferings of Christ, when
   men are enabled by grace to offer themselves to God in all their
   sufferings, and to trust God in simplicity and not in wicked cunning.
   God ordains all and bears the burden Himself, and thus men learn true
   resignation, and God is able to help them in their infirmity. Thus God
   begins to draw man by His love from the love of the creature, and they
   begin to learn discrimination in all their actions, to trust God in all
   things, and to understand that they must not think anything of
   themselves, nor trust to self, nor rest in anything, but only in the
   Grace of God. Therefore they believe fully that they will not be
   deceived; but he who trusts in himself will be deceived. Now this
   results in yet more grace; and such men begin to distinguish between
   Divine Grace and emotional feelings; for notice how many a man leads a
   seemingly good life, and is outwardly humble and simple, and who yet
   thinks much of himself in his heart.

   Good virgins keep, both outwardly and inwardly, and with all their
   might, all the ordinary, good and regular ordinances of the Holy Church
   and the Holy Scripture. They commune with their own hearts, and cleave
   to God, to Whom they may best pour out all their wants, and not to man.
   When they thus turn away from man, they will have to suffer much
   oppression and shame from him; and yet they will hold their peace in
   all their difficulties, laying all before God and not before man,
   accustoming themselves to meditate constantly on the Sufferings and
   Life of Christ. God gives them strength through the Sufferings of
   Christ, so that they dare to stand alone, although they are despised
   for it, and they dare to carry on their own meditations. But this they
   do in fear and trembling before God, because it is counted wrong and
   foolish by man. But God bears witness to their consciences, and that
   makes them very thankful, so that they rejoice out of love to God. The
   Enemy cannot easily ensnare such people by means of sorrow, because
   they have constant communion, and hope for nothing from the light of
   nature, human wisdom, or things that seem good. They do not depend only
   upon sweet communion and fervour; just as though all must be well with
   them, and they must be united with God, because things do go well with
   them. Those who imagine thus are the most deceived by the Devil; but
   they must leave all to God, discipline themselves and examine
   themselves, both outwardly and inwardly, and flee to God with all their
   might without any delay. Though the body must sometimes rest outwardly
   from discipline, the heart ceases not to give God thanks, to honour
   Him, and to resist all that is inconsistent with the needs of the body.
   These people pray that God will forgive them their sins, because they
   displease Him, and not in order to escape the pains of hell, or to
   attain to everlasting life. They pray that God will do what He wills
   with them and as He wills, till they come to their End, and that here
   and hereafter God may be glorified in them. They pray that they may not
   displease God by their sins, but that He will forgive them; that they
   may not be prevented from receiving grace, so that they may learn to
   continue in virtue. They pray for remission of sins, not for remission
   of pain; that they leave to God. Mark, this it is to which man comes,
   if he exercises himself in the Sufferings of Christ for this object,
   and if he perseveres to the end.

   Alas! how few men attain to this; and all because of their
   superficiality, so that they do not turn simply to God in their hearts.
   Therefore one man is very unlike another in this life; and this arises
   solely from this reason, that the one cannot be content without
   external work and internal discipline, while the other is quite content
   with external work: this pearl is not therefore given alike to all.
   Thus it comes to pass that men cannot understand one another; and at
   times they cause each other pain; but when it is understood that it was
   done in ignorance, man should bear patiently with them, while their
   blindness must also be borne patiently. By such goodhearted men God
   desires to teach many other people, and to call them into the right
   way, as they have well known in their hearts. For they who did not give
   up self, before they entered in, or they who have not truly entered in,
   are likely to fall into many errors, before they are aware of it; for
   they easily find that which appeals to nature and which pleases their
   senses; and thus they make no spiritual progress. If God suffers this
   carnal service, still He is not pleased with it; for all the great
   fruitfulness, of which we have already spoken, is checked in them, and
   in all those who might have been helped by them, if they had taken the
   first course, and had cast off their carnal desires and had then looked
   into their own hearts. But now they have remained in this carnal
   service, which yields but little; but it would indeed be well if those
   men were to turn, to submit, to the best of their power, to the blessed
   Will of God, and thus to glorify God, and to be of use to those people
   with whom God is angry, and who have brought many people into sin.

   Now, as I have already shown, this pearl may, perchance, become very
   fruitful, which was found first in sweetness, in confession, in love
   and all kinds of discipline. But then man will have to come down again
   from sweetness to bitterness, in resignation and suffering out of love,
   and thus to die to self. The freer man is from self-pleasing, the freer
   he will be from the snares of the Devil, from the temptations and
   misery of these times, from hell and purgatory; neither will he be
   likely to fall again into sin, unless he turns again with all his heart
   and soul thereto; and that is not likely to happen. As the first state
   of fervour demands deeds of virtue, done in sweetness, so this grade
   demands deeds of virtue, done in hard labour, with gnawings of
   conscience and severe discipline; which must all be borne in simple
   faith and trust in God, that He will not forsake him, either now or
   hereafter. It it seems to him as though God would forsake him, he must
   stand firm in hope, and trust in God in all that He may see fit to do
   with him, in time and in eternity. See what comes of meditating on the
   Sufferings of God. These men bear the pain of suffering according to
   their power; and it is to such an end that the man comes, who first
   simply turns with all his thoughts to the Sufferings and Life of
   Christ, so that at last he will even come to choose bitterness. God
   grant that we also may find this precious pearl, and that it may bring
   us to all the goodness of God. Amen.

  SERMON XXIX

      On the Feast of the Twelve Apostles

   On the life of men who serve God, and desire to please Him in Perfect
   Love. How it comes to pass that so few men are really spiritual.

   Si dilegitis me, mandata mea servate.

   "If ye love Me, keep My commandments."

   St John tells us in his Gospel, and also proves to us, that as our dear
   Lord had loved His own that were in the world, so He loved them unto
   the very end, giving them many proofs of His consoling love, which He
   showed to them, especially in word and deed, at the Last Supper, of
   which He so earnestly desired to partake with them. He exhorted them
   also to that love which they justly owed to Him; and because they could
   only truly show it by keeping His commandments, He would pray to His
   Heavenly Father to send and give them another Comforter, even the
   Spirit of Truth, Who would abide with them for ever, and Whom the world
   could not receive because it hath neither seen Him (Jesus) nor known
   Him.

   Therefore, dear children, I will once more speak of love, because it is
   always most sweet and pleasant to speak of it; but much sweeter is it
   to taste and experience it. Now God commands all those who are dear to
   Him, to show their love to Him by keeping His commandments: therefore
   he who openly breaks them, or does not keep them, cannot love Him. It
   is plain to all that God hates those who live in sin; therefore I will
   not say any more about them; but I will speak, as well as I can, of the
   life of those who serve God in the highest love.

   Those who wish to love God must keep His commandments; that is, they
   must be ready to do the Will of God, and to have no will of their own;
   but must be able to say in truth, "Not my will but Thine be done."
   God's Will is true love; and true love has no love for self, but loves
   self only for the sake of those who are loved. Three things are needed
   for this. First, we must diligently keep guard over our outer senses,
   so that we may learn to close and to keep careful watch over the gates
   of our five senses, resisting all irregular desires, overcoming them at
   once, always watching them closely, and never giving way to them.

   The second thing we have to do is to learn to die to all inner
   delights, our own ways and modes of living, not consenting to them in
   any way, and especially guarding ourselves against these five spiritual
   gates of hell: our own free will or love, satisfaction or presumption,
   our own spiritual delights, our own judgment, and our own wisdom.

   Thirdly, a loving soul must have its daily work and discipline towards
   God and towards self, that it may offer itself, out of pure love, as a
   living sacrifice unto God, in perfect fear, before all men. This takes
   place in such marvellous love, that it cannot well be expressed in
   words; but we ought rather to try it and to taste it, for it surpasses
   all the powers of nature and sense. For the soul overflows with the
   freedom of the spirit with which it is endowed, and goes to the
   Heavenly Father, and unites itself with Him, as far as it can, by the
   absolute annihilation of self, to His high and blessed praise. It
   yields itself wholly to Him, in a fathomless Nothingness, in the Abyss
   of His Godhead, and beseeches Him to make it fruitful in His service;
   and, as He has loved and chosen it from all eternity, that He will
   bring to pass in it, and in all creatures, that for which He has
   created them, according to His most precious and sweet Will, whatever
   it may be, without any self-choosing. Thus the soul desires to be an
   example and pattern of righteousness and mercy, if so it pleases Him,
   and not that it should earn condemnation by its works. It therefore
   lifts itself up in prayer to God for strength to carry out His Blessed
   Will.

   From the Father it goes to the Eternal Wisdom, and yields itself up in
   true simplicity, ready to be nothing, to know nothing, to see nothing,
   to taste nothing, of self, but that all it does, or leaves undone, may
   be to His praise and in accordance with His dear Will. It beeches Him
   to perfect in it and in all creatures, according to His Divine Wisdom,
   all that He sees right and is most praiseworthy in His sight and is the
   most fruitful for all men. It does not regard self, but is content with
   all things in true simplicity, and waits for the working of God. It
   believes and expects, nothing doubting, that He will do it, hoping that
   all comes from God. Then, whatever happens to the soul to the praise of
   God, it accepts as from the Hand of God. It neither strives to prove or
   experience anything, but simply does all that it believes to be His
   Will; not sure of it but believing it. If the soul were to follow its
   own ideas, things might often seem opposed to its integrity; but it
   must not do thus, but must rest in faith and in perfect confidence on
   God. Thus God is exalted in it according to His Wisdom, and its
   understanding is abased. This discipline is also cherished and used by
   the loving soul in small and insignificant things. Thus it is purified
   by the Wisdom of God in true simplicity, and comes thus to the
   unscrutable Divinity in the Darkness of His Obscurity, wherein He is
   exalted and incomprehensible to all creatures. For He is a pure Being,
   to Whom the created powers of man cannot attain, though they may be
   united with Him by faith, hope and love.

   Now, when all this has been completed, the loving soul goes to the Holy
   Ghost, Which proceeds both from the Father and the Son, and submits
   itself to Him, uniting itself so completely with Him, that it is
   exalted above all created things, and rises above faith, hope and love
   in God. It is united with this love, far above all gifts in the Abyss
   of His Uncreatedness, so deeply and so closely, that but few created
   beings can attain to it by the understanding. For the union and the
   freedom which exist are incomprehensible to all creatures; and thus man
   attains a little of the Humanity of Christ, if we may so speak, and is
   not ashamed, but has fellowship and union with Christ; so that, when he
   desires to ask anything of the Father, he takes Christ with him to pray
   the Father. This takes place especially in the Blessed Sacrament; and
   thus they offer themselves together to the Eternal Father, in the same
   power and fruitfulness of the Holy Church, in which Christ offered
   Himself upon the Cross saying: "Into Thy Hands I commend My Spirit."
   Then the man says again in different love: "O Lord, be merciful unto
   me, as Thy Father was merciful unto Thee, and help me to pray that the
   Will of the Holy Trinity may be done in me, according to the measure of
   my miserable imperfections, as perfectly as it was done in Thee; and
   let me be one with Thee in the fear of the Holy Church. O Lord, Thou
   hast suffered once, and hast redeemed the world; Thou canst not
   therefore suffer any more; but I desire to suffer in Thy place.
   Therefore spare me not, as Thy Father spared Thee not; for my heart is
   ready for all that may seem good to Thee in time and in eternity. O
   Lord, Thou knowest how I can most praiseworthily thank Thee and be
   helpful to all men. Therefore, O Lord, command Thou me." Thus we trust
   all to God, that all shall be to the glory of God; but, before his soul
   is able to offer itself up, it must travel by many an unknown, painful
   and desert way.

   God comes to those who have passed along these two ways, and leads in
   the loving soul Himself and instructs it in the third way of love; and
   thus it becomes truly united with God; of which something has already
   been said. Alas! alas! that so few men are truly spiritual. This arises
   from the fact that men will not walk in this way and others like it,
   and therefore they are not fruitful before all men. a man who wished
   thus to devote himself to the commands of love ought to be more
   fruitful and more useful than ten other men who also wished to serve
   God, but in unguarded outbursts of impatience; not in simplicity, but
   in outward active service; not in contemplative love, as has been said.

   It is thus that men come from the sleep of darkness into the True
   Light. For now fresh grace is offered to us; and, if we do not lay hold
   of it, it will flee from us and vanish away, how we shall not know.
   Therefore let us all unite in calling upon God for real simplicity and
   humility, that from the bottom of our hearts we may humble and despise
   ourselves, and that we may look upon ourselves as the most despised,
   the most rejected and the most unworthy of men to be found in this
   world; so that all who see us will shake their heads at us and mock us,
   and we are so unworthy that all creatures will lift themselves up
   against us. Thus we may truly learn to die to our own wills, and also
   learn to keep ourselves free from self, both outwardly and inwardly,
   and learn further to offer up ourselves to the glory of God, doing the
   Will of God, not drawing back again, or choosing for ourselves, either
   in time or eternity. That we may do thus, not to please ourselves, but
   from the desire to be well-pleasing unto God, as I have attempted to
   show, may God grant. Amen.

  SERMON XXX

      On the Feast of Martyrs

   Of the two kinds of suffering; in a dying and spiritual life, in true
   resignation. How God points out the way to His Friends, and teaches
   them to be truly resigned, in the highest sense; after the Example set
   them by Christ the Lord, Who has tasted this cup. Not only the twelve
   Apostles and Martyrs have, like Him, drunk of this cup, but all truly
   resigned men, of whom the Church of Christ sings: "They have drunk the
   cup of the Lord and have become the Friends of God."

   Calicem Domini biberunt, et amici Dei facti sunt.

   "They have drunk of the Lord's chalice and have become the Friends of
   God."

   We celebrate to-day the Feast of the Holy Martyrs, whom God, the
   Heavenly Father, has vouchsafed to endow with the especial honour of
   being formed in the Likeness of His Only begotten Son, by the
   bitterness and pain of the precious and beautiful cup of which they
   have drunk, like the Son of God; which means that they have willingly
   suffered martyrdom for the confession of His Name. It is their peculiar
   honour that, by grace, they have been able to attain to the dignity to
   which He was exalted by the Cup of bitter suffering, and by the Death
   which He suffered for us and for all men. Therefore, we sing of those
   fearless knights and dearest Friends of God, that they have drunk the
   cup of the Lord, and have become the Friends of God.

   Now mark, dear children, that, when we speak of martyrs there are two
   kinds of martyrdom. Martyrs outwardly by the sword, and martyrs
   inwardly by dying love. We read of St Martin, that he was not robbed of
   the honour of a martyr although he was not taken hence by the sword.
   Now, ye must notice here that we can experience the Suffering of God,
   and test it, by worthy contrition in a dying life; and can thus become
   the Friends of God. He who desires this must submit to suffering--but
   suffering takes place in two ways.

   The first kind of suffering, in a dying life, is external, when men
   struggle against their pleasure-loving, sinful life; of whom St Paul
   says: "They that are Christ's have crucified their flesh; with the
   vices and concupiscences."

   The second kind of suffering consists of spiritual perplexity,
   barrenness, or the deprivation of visible grace. Here man is often most
   at a loss, and he is thus sometimes driven to turn all the more to God.
   Then some men think all is lost, if they do not posses wisdom,
   understanding and keen insight; if they are not greatly tempted and are
   not full of fervour. It is true that this is all very necessary for the
   beginner, but not for those who long for the noblest virtue, love; but
   it is accounted of little value by the others. It is true, indeed, that
   it is a good preparation for the next stage; but in itself it is of
   little value. Very few can be found who truly love. All want to follow
   Christ in sweetness; and, when they can taste nothing sweet, and are
   drawn on by wounded love, they will not follow God in any other way.
   Now, when God sees that by sweetness only, and in no other way, can He
   lead them, He entices them on by wounded love, and then by imprisoned
   love, so that they cannot escape Him. After this they come to burning
   love, and they become so strong that all things comfort them, and they
   are ready, for the glory of God, to cast themselves into any suffering
   or sorrow, which God may see fit to inflict on them. Then they offer
   themselves up in the secret Abyss of the Godhead, and say in full
   confidence: "O Lord, if Thou wilt preserve or condemn us; Thou art all
   powerful, Thy Will be done in us." Now, when a man arrives at this, he
   has gained that which he sought; and it is the same to God, by which
   road he has arrived at it, and in what way.

   God freely pours forth His gifts, that He may draw all souls unto
   Himself; and supplies us so bountifully with His Grace that we may
   offer up our souls to Him, in true resignation, without any hesitation
   or demur. Now when, as we have said before, God gives great grace to a
   soul, and tempts it with sweetness, He desires to draw it away from
   self. When this has taken place, and He has then drawn the soul away
   from sweetness to barrenness, He then places it in a higher grade. For
   He will take away from it again all that He ever gave it, and allows
   the man to be poor and distressed, so that he may begin to learn to be
   resigned, and to rest in nothing save in God only.

   There are two ways by which we may attain to the true Love of God: The
   first is delight in the Grace of God. It is pleasant to man to carry
   out good practices; and God allows it, so that casual lusts may be all
   the more speedily extinguished in him. The man is ready to sell himself
   for love; that is, he feels such keen contempt for all temporal
   pleasures, which he no longer heeds because of his great love, that all
   who see him marvel. Thus we read of many Saints, that they so speedily
   withdrew from the joys of the world and all its delights, and turned
   their backs on all so bravely, that all men wondered. This is done
   undoubtedly by the Holy Ghost, in His mighty Love, which is as strong
   as death.

   The second way is by endurance and suffering; and, as we have already
   said, in this way man is robbed of all spiritual comfort. It is thus
   that the spiritual strength of martyrs is brought forth in the
   barrenness and dryness of their meditations and fervour; and, although
   these spiritual martyrs are filled with many sorrows, yet they love God
   and long for true virtue as much as the others. Such men are much
   troubled in this life, so that they do not know which way to turn
   because of their affliction. They rest, however, on faith, hope and
   love, alone, in great darkness; for they will not sin whatever befalls
   them, because at all times they bear about with them a clean and humble
   heart; while they are much afflicted by seeing the grace enjoyed by
   other men, always imagining that it is their own fault that they have
   not the same grace, and that they do not strive enough to gain it.
   However, when they seek it more diligently, they only become more and
   more barren and hard within, like stone, and sometimes they lose all
   patience, and become all the more inconsolable and miserable. Then they
   fear that they are jealous of the grace given to others, or envy them;
   and thus they add to their sufferings, so that, with all these troubles
   or others like them, they weary themselves so much that they do not
   know what to do. They would not willingly be faithless to God in
   virtue, while they do not know how to gain it; or they imagine that
   they will make God angry with their impatience, despair or moroseness;
   and it cuts them to the heart. They hate all sin, because sin is
   displeasing and abhorrent to God; and they know his so well that they
   would not willingly anger God. At last they make up their minds to be
   patient, although it is hard to them; and they suffer and wait till God
   sends relief, for they see that they can make no progress. Thus God
   teaches them to be resigned and to submit, leaving all things in His
   hands; and thus they become like unto the others, who flourish in more
   grace; while in one sense they are much nobler; for, in this grade, men
   are more like Christ, whose Life was full of suffering.

   These spiritual martyrs are the poorest in their own esteem, but, in
   the sight of God, they are the richest; according to their own ideas
   they are the farthest off from God, and yet they are the nearest. They
   imagine that of all they are the castaways, and yet they are the very
   elect. According to their own feelings they are the most unfaithful to
   God; though they are the most faithful and the most earnest in
   furthering His glory, and in preventing His dishonour; for it is for
   this that they suffer. They find that they are attacked by many
   temptations on account of their poverty, to which they will not
   consent; but these cause them greater suffering than dying a natural
   death, and, especially if in any way, as they imagine, they have been
   overcome. They are anxious to overcome their infirmities, and to
   practice virtue, and they cannot do it. This and such-like things cause
   them, at times, great inner suffering and trouble, as though they were
   suffering pains of hell; but all is the result of the great
   faithfulness and love that they bear to God in their hearts, though
   they are not conscious of it themselves. They think themselves of all
   men the most wicked in all the world, while they are the purest in the
   sight of God. They often anger God thereby, because they cause
   themselves so much sorrow, so that God sometimes allows them to fall
   into impatience, and other infirmities, which are not in accordance
   with pure love, and to which they would never have given way, had they
   been truly resigned in all things; for then they would have been at
   peace and would have advanced more quickly than other men. They thus
   rob themselves by their despondency and immoderate sadness. This arises
   from their knowledge of the real fruit which proceeds from thence or
   from their self-surrender, so that they are not content to suffer; or
   it seems so long for them to suffer to the end; but they should know
   that they only prolong their suffering and make it all the harder. Thus
   they also rob themselves of the real fruit which might be quickly
   produced, if only they would suffer innocently and willingly, and
   resign themselves in love. The more simply they do this, the more nobly
   will they gain it, and the more nobly will they be transformed. For,
   verily, if man walks uprightly, after the dark night a bright light
   will arise, which will lighten up all his heart with Eternal Truth.
   Then in his own heart, and in the sight of God, but not in the sight of
   the world, he will be sure that he can attain to the highest and purest
   Love, in which a man loses and forsakes himself, and all that is his,
   for the sake of God, that none can disturb or destroy his peace. God
   rests in him with all His elect, and there will and anger are lost. God
   help us that all this may take place in us.

   Further, we must remember this about salvation: "O, my soul, meditate
   and meditate, again and again, how great and inexpressible the joy, the
   blessedness, the glory and the honour will be of those who will see
   clearly, and face to face the joyful and loving Face of God. How they
   will enjoy the best and highest blessing, even God Himself; for in Him,
   and in Him alone, are all pleasures, power, joy and all that is most
   beautiful." They will possess all in God; all that is good and to be
   desired, in safety and eternal joy, so that they will be transformed
   into God, never to be separated from Him again. Oh! how surpassingly
   great the joy will be, with which they will see the Holy Trinity, Mary,
   the Mother of Christ; our dear Lord, all the hosts of Angels in their
   orders; all the Patriarchs and Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors
   and Virgins, with all the Saints, who are so united, that, were it
   possible, the foremost and greatest Saint in heaven would willingly
   share his joy with the least of all Saints, while the least of all the
   Saints would not grudge him the joy that he shares with his own.
   Neither can we imagine or describe the overwhelming Love of God, which
   will be kindled in them: Oh! how foolish those men are, who, for a
   little carnal delight, and for temporal goods and honour, can so far
   forget, lose and drive away eternal salvation. Therefore, recollect
   thyself, O my soul, earnestly and diligently, while thy day of grace is
   not yet over; do good works, that thou mayest not lose thy eternal
   salvation. Set to work, lose no time to perfect thyself in virtue; let
   nothing disconcert thee, but work faithfully in this short life to
   attain eternal blessings and eternal joy. Nothing in this world should
   be so dear to thee that for the sake of it thou wouldest be ready to
   lose eternal glory and joy. Thou must mark diligently how all
   suffering, sorrow, adversity and misery in this world, are not to be
   compared with the joy of eternal life. In imagination thou must place
   before thee, as thine example, all the dear Saints who have entered in,
   because of their good and righteous lives, that thou mayest follow
   them, and that with them thou mayest be a partaker of the exceeding
   great reward. Oh my soul, meditate on the great honour, joy and dignity
   in the Heavenly City of Jerusalem, on all the dear Saints who are
   assembled there, and who found a safe path by which they passed over
   from this transient vale of sorrow to eternal life.

   Further, the Lord tells us in the Gospel that there are five things
   which faithful men must do. First, they must cast out the devil in the
   Name of Jesus; all men can do this who confess their sins with true
   penitence and sorrow. Secondly, they must speak with new tongues. All
   do this who give up sinful useless talk, and who only use good words,
   such as are to be found in the Word of God, the Holy Gospels and in
   fervent prayers; who rebuke sinners and teach the foolish. The third is
   that they tread on serpents without being harmed. This is done by those
   who resist and diligently root out all evil thoughts. The fourth sign
   is that they can eat and drink poison without harm. This is done by all
   who suffer contempt and persecution for righteousness' sake. Those who
   are sorrowful and despised, and yet are patient, cannot be hurt by the
   poison of persecution. The fifth and last sign is, that the truly
   faithful lay their hands on the sick and they recover. All men do this,
   who from loving-kindness freely forgive their enemies all that they
   ever wrought against them, and who also give alms to the poor and
   needy. We may truly say of all men who show these five signs of the
   Holy Gospel, that they are truly faithful men and will be received by
   Christ into eternal life. May God help us all thereto. Amen.

  SERMON XXXI

      On a Holy Martyr's Day

   Of three roots of spiritual temptation by which holy men are secretly
   assailed; spiritual unchastity, covetousness and pride.

   Beatus vir gui suffert tentationem.

   "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation."

   All our life, says Job, so long as we are upon earth, is full of
   struggle and temptation, insomuch that this life is not called a life
   by the Saints, but a temptation. When one temptation is over,
   straightway others are awaiting us; and the cause is that our Lord will
   have us to go and bring forth fruit; and the fruit is to walk in the
   ways of God and go forward; for the fruit consists in the very
   overcoming of temptation, from which we may draw out a hidden spiritual
   sweetness, as the bees suck honey from the thorn bushes as well as from
   all other flowers. He who has not yet been tempted knows nothing, nor
   lives as yet, say the wise man Solomon and the holy teacher St Bernard.
   We find more than t thousand testimonies in Scripture to the great
   profit of temptation; for it is the special sign of the Love of God
   towards a man for him to be tempted and yet kept from falling; for thus
   he must and shall of a certainty receive the crown, like the Martyr
   whose death the Christian Church commemorates this day, singing of him
   that he is blessed because he hath endured temptation, and has been
   tried and proved therein, that he might receive the Crown of Life,
   which the Lord has promised to them that love Him.

   Now observe, dear children, that there are two kinds of temptation. The
   one is carnal, and has its sphere in the kingdom of sense in this
   present life, as when a man is tempted through his outward senses to
   seek his happiness in other men, be they friends or relations or any
   others, or to undue fondness for the outward show of life, such as
   dress, jewels, books, instruments, a pleasant abode, and other
   transitory creatures; and wilfully cleaves there unto with manifold
   affections, and they stick to him like burrs. At times our outward
   senses are left in peace, and are quite of all assaults; yet is the man
   strangely assaulted inwardly in his flesh and blood by unseemly
   thoughts; but, however impure may be these temptations, and however
   horrible they may look, they cannot of themselves defile a man's
   purity. St Gregory says: "Temptations do not defile a man except
   through his own slackness and want of diligence in turning aside from
   them."

   The other sort of temptation is inward and spiritual, and has its seat
   in the realm of the intellect. The workings of the Spirit and of nature
   are so mingled together and interwoven as long as we are in this
   present life, that all our inward exercises and converse with God are
   carried on at the same time with all the motions and workings of
   nature. Moreover, our Lord has so ordained it for our good, that the
   evil angel, Satan, has power to transform himself before the inward eye
   of the mind into an angel of light; and he does it most of all at those
   times when a man gathers up all his powers to enter into communion with
   God. Observe, dear children, that St John divides sin into three kings,
   when he says all that is of the world is "the lust of the flesh, and
   the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." As these three sins that
   reign in the world exist together in the flesh, so do they also reign
   inwardly in the mind under a spiritual guide. Outward sins are very
   clear and easy to see, if a man have a mind to watch himself; but these
   mental sins are in many ways more covert, and can be put on such a good
   face that we are often hardly aware of the grievous fall that is close
   at hand.

   Now mark, it is to be counted as spiritual unchastity or wantonness,
   when a man seeks himself too much, and with eager desire strives after
   warmth and sensible devoutness, to the end that he may always be in a
   state of contentment, and none may have a right to reprove him, though
   he shall give himself to his own special prayers and religious
   exercises, while leaving unfulfilled the work that is his duty. When
   such an one has none of these sweet emotions, he is quite troubled, and
   becomes peevish and very impatient in the trifling mishaps that befall
   him, though they are really of no importance whatever; and when he
   cannot obtain joy or inward peace according to his desire, he complains
   of the great grievances and temptations which he has to endure. St
   Bernard says, that our Lord bestows these graces of sensible emotion
   upon such as have done nothing to deserve them nor are worthy of them;
   but He does this in mercy, that He may draw such to His love; and He
   withholds these gifts from some who have undergone long and painful
   exercises, and were well fit to receive them; yea, from some He
   withholds them all their life long; but He will give them a great
   recompense for it in the next life. The reason of His thus withholding
   sensible delight is, that our spiritual fruitfulness and highest
   blessedness do not lie therein, but in our inward trusting and clinging
   to God, in our not seeking ourselves either in sorrow or joy, but
   through joy and sorrow devoting ourselves to God, and, like poor
   unworthy servants, offering ourselves to Him at our own costs, though
   we should have to serve Him thus for ever. Yet it may indeed be
   permitted to a young weak Christian, at the outset of his course, to
   pray for such graces or gifts from our good God, in order to be able to
   glorify Him with the greater activity, and to be grounded the more
   firmly to His love. But when we desire such inward fervours and sweet
   peace (which are His gifts and not our deserts) more for their own sake
   than for the Giver Himself, we fall into spiritual wantonness and black
   disloyalty, which our good God has not deserved at our hands, with His
   utter renunciation of Himself outwardly and inwardly.

   Spiritual covetousness is when a man is always coveting to have more
   than bare necessities, while pursuing this earthly pilgrimage. For what
   more should a pilgrim take with him by the way, than such things as are
   needful to sustain him till he come safely to his home? Believe me, it
   is a great blemish in true outward poverty to desire aught beyond
   necessaries; so likewise, it is a still greater blemish in the inward
   poverty of the spirit. Ah! who has ever been so poor as He, Who, in
   utter poorness of spirit stood forsaken by Heaven and by the creatures,
   cast out alone in utter exile, when He sent forth that bitter cry: "My
   God, My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?" And this was all that He might
   be an Ensample unto us, to comfort our poverty and bereavement by
   teaching us true submission. I hear thee saying: "Yes, if it were not
   my own fault, and if I had not failed to receive the blessing through
   my own heedlessness, or thrown it away by mine own guilty folly, I
   could bear it all the better; what should I then have to mourn over?
   But now it is all my own doing; I have brought the mischief upon
   myself." I answer, do not let this lead thee astray; dost thou not know
   how that it is written: "The just man falleth seven times, and riseth
   up again;" and dost thou think to stand always? Yes, I assert and
   confess with thee that it is thine own fault, that thou hast brought it
   upon thyself and well deserved it; yet, nevertheless, it is better that
   thou shouldst with firm trust pray our kind God for His peace (Who
   knows thy weakness, and is ready to forgive thy trespasses seventy
   times seven in a day), than that thou shouldst thus drive thyself back
   in thy course with such faintheartedness. O child, hast thou fallen?
   arise, and go with childlike trust to thy Father, like the prodigal
   son, and humbly say with heart and mouth: "Father, I have sinned
   against Heaven and before Thee, and am no more worthy to be called Thy
   son, make me as one of Thy hired servants." And what will thy Heavenly
   Father do, but what that father did in the parable? Assuredly He will
   not change His Essence, which is Love, for the sake of thy misdoings.
   Is it not His own precious treasure, and a small thing with Him, to
   forgive thee thy trespasses, if thou believe in Him? for His Hand is
   not shortened that it cannot make thee fit to be saved. Therefore,
   beware of spiritual covetousness, for the poorer thou art in thine own
   eyes when thou comest to Him, the more acceptable art thou in His
   sight, and the more richly He will endow thee and clothe thee out of
   His treasures.

   Spiritual pride is when a man is not willing to be put to shame in his
   own eyes on account of his transgressions, but is ever trying to excuse
   and gloss over his faults, and is ever willing to spare himself, even
   in small matters. And this often leads people to make many useless and
   wrong speeches in order to excuse themselves and to justify themselves
   in every respect; as much as to say, "I am not the man to be accused of
   this and that"; and they are unwilling to remember or consider that he
   who cannot clear himself with the simple truth, will not be helped by
   the untruths by which he often adds to his guilt; and that a man who
   humbles himself before God is more in His eyes than an arrogant,
   self-righteous man, who deems himself able to answer for all his deeds
   with his own righteousness. Hearken, dear child, what does all our
   righteousness come to at last? Esaias saith: "All our righteousnesses
   are as filthy rags;" and, however great our righteousness is or might
   become, yet, if the Lord should sit in judgment on us, without doubt we
   should have to confess ourselves His debtors, and place all our hopes
   in His mercy. Our Lord often disciplines a man by his own failings, if
   he is humble under them and throws himself at God's Feet; for God will
   have every knee to bend before Him, and will have the praise and glory
   of all goodness. Hence we may observe that there is often a secret
   pride within us, from which many unseemly points do grow. But he who
   gives diligence to beware of spiritual wantonness, covetousness and
   pride, shall be kept from straying out of God's ways, or falling into
   error in his inward exercises.

   But, in order to keep yourselves from these sins, and to withstand this
   kind of temptation, you must observe these rules of which I will tell
   you. The first is: None of the inward difficulties that rise up from
   within, or the adverse circumstances that stay our hands from working,
   by which we are drawn or pressed into the likeness and conformity to
   the humble Image of Christ and His Saints (not alone outwardly, but
   that of their inward condition), can be the work either of evil spirits
   or of nature, but without a doubt come from God. For He is the Highest
   Good, and from the Highest Good nought but what is good can flow; and
   all the goodness that God gives us of His stores, and that we render
   back again to Him, has proceeded from Him as its Source; just as all
   streams flow back again to their source, the ocean, whence they have
   arisen; and all things do rejoice in their return. But all that draws
   us and leads us aside from such conformity and likeness, proceeds
   without doubt from the Spirit of Evil, who is ever on the watch to
   disturb and draw us down; as our Lord said: "He who is not with Me is
   against Me, and he who gathereth not with Me scattereth." This rule is
   against the first spiritual vice, that of wantonness.

   The second rule is: Whatever befalls a man inwardly, whereby he is
   brought to a closer and more sensible gathering up of all his
   affections and impulses in singleness of heart into a steadfast trust
   in and love of the Father's lovingkindness, and not his own works and
   experiences; this is from God. And he who at all times sees himself to
   be a poor beggar, however fair his works may seem, the more narrowly he
   looks into his own heart, and the more mastery he gains over himself,
   the more does he discover his own nakedness of all virtue. He becomes
   aware in himself that he is nothing but an empty worthless vessel,
   fitted, not unto honour but unto eternal destruction, which vessel God
   alone must and will fill with His grace. When we cling to Him, suffer
   Him to have access to our spirits, and do not defend ourselves with
   ourselves, that work is no doubt of God, by which a man is driven into
   himself to learn his own poverty. But the suggestions of the Enemy and
   of nature rob and despoil a man of all the benefits of his virtues; and
   this is the case wherever a man does not know his own real state, and
   thinks to possess what he never had, and says (as it is written): "I am
   rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing," and knows not
   that he is "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." This
   is the rule against spiritual covetousness.

   The third rule is: Whatever befalls a man by which he is lessened and
   humbled in his own inmost emotions, and which makes him bend under the
   Almighty Hand of God, under all creatures, abasing and annihilating
   himself in true humility; this comes no doubt from God. For as Lucifer
   and his followers desired to be great and lofty, and were therefore
   thrust down from Heaven, so are we led back again to Heaven by
   self-abasement; as it is said of the Kings of the East, that they
   travelled back into their own land again by another way.

   Thus does every being do and teach according to that which is his
   essence, drawing into his own likeness all whom there are to draw, so
   far as in him lies. The Evil Spirit is puffed up in his own obstinate
   conceit, and in the loftiness of his pride is so hardened and unbending
   in his own stiff-necked will and purpose, that neither to win Heaven
   nor for anything else will he humble himself for one moment, so fixed
   is he in his evil mind. So likewise is it with all the proud, who have
   learnt of him to trust in their own understandings, above all other
   men's opinion and reason; wherefore they fall into strife and variance
   with their neighbours, which begets much trouble and disquiet of heart;
   and hence arise many breaches of brotherly love. They will take reproof
   from none, and grow so hardened in their own obstinate, evil will, and
   set upon their purposes, that they rashly dare to withstand all the
   admonitions of God and His Friends; as the Jewish scribes and priests
   withstood our Blessed Lord; and of such the prophet Esaias, speaking in
   the person of Christ, complains: "I have spread out my hands all the
   day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good,
   after their own thoughts."

   But our blessed Lord, on the contrary, is meek and humble; yea, He is
   Himself the essence of humility, whereunto He is unceasingly drawing
   all men whom there are to draw, and who are willing to be drawn. His
   Being is the cause, the essence and the origin of all things. He is the
   Life of the living, the Resurrection of the dead, the Restorer of all
   deformity and unfitness, and of those who have corrupted and despoiled
   themselves through sin. He calleth back those who have fallen away and
   have wandered from His fold. He raised up and confirmeth those who are
   in temptation. He is the Bulwark of those who stand, the Awakener and
   Guide of all who are looking and striving upwards towards Him, the
   Source of all light, the Lamp of all who walk in light, the Revealer of
   mysteries, in so far as it is fitting for us to know, and the Beginning
   of all beginnings. His Essence is incomprehensible, unspeakable and
   without a name. Therefore should we honour and glorify His unspeakable
   Mystery with holy reverence and silence, and nevermore covet to fathom
   or to taste aught except in so far as is to His honour and to our
   profit; but ever, with fit reverence and devoutness, turn with all our
   might in shamefaced awe to contemplate the radiance of His bright and
   spotless Mirror. It behoves man to be ever in fear, and to bethink him
   of the word that God, our Lord, spake by the mouth of Moses: "If a man
   or a beast touch the mountain, he shall be stoned"; which signifies
   that our animal senses must not presume to clime the Mount of the
   Divine Essence, but must rather keep themselves below and take the
   nearest place, until the time come when it shall be said unto the man:
   "Friend, come up higher." And then he shall not go up of himself, but
   he shall suffer himself to be led upwards; and his sensual nature shall
   be purified and endowed with the Light of God, whereby he shall receive
   more light than he could ever win by all his great and strenuous
   labour. For the Divine Nature of Christ is a magnet that draws unto
   itself all spirits and hearts that bear its likeness, and daily unites
   them to itself through love.

   Now Richard of St Victor says: "I receive Christ not alone on the
   Cross, but also in His Transfiguration on Mount Tabor. But I may not
   receive Him there except I find James, Peter and John, Moses and Elias
   with Him, who bear witness to me that it is truly Christ." That is to
   say: in all our distresses, in all our painful inward destitution, we
   may boldly believe that Christ is present with us; but, if He appears
   to us on the mount of inward contemplation, we need these witnesses,
   that we may not enjoy the fruitation of His gifts in a wanton spirit,
   for the satisfaction of our own desires, nor too ardently covet more of
   His good gifts than we can put to a good use; but may ever abase
   ourselves so thoroughly that we fall not into any spiritual pride.
   These are the true witnesses, that we may freely receive Christ in His
   Glory on the heights of Mount Tabor, without hindrance or error; for
   where these witnesses are of a truth, there we cannot be deceived by
   the spirit of falsehood. May Almighty God help us so to do! Amen.

  SERMON XXXII

      On the Feast of a Holy Bishop

   How man should exalt and honour God's Holy Name alone, and despise,
   shun and flee from his own in true humility and real resignation. That
   young men, growing in grace, must first be directed thereto, and then
   be drawn by all kinds of easy exercises and rebukes, that they may
   become still more resigned in all things hereafter.

   In nomine meo exaltabitur cornu ejus.

   "In My Name shall his horn be exalted."

   You know, dear children, that no sins are so displeasing to the God of
   Gods, as the haughty arrogance and the proud boasting of man in his own
   name; because man is thus ascribing the honour to himself, which
   belongs only to God, while he cannot bear his own name to be despised.
   God lent him that name and the honour, that other men might be improved
   by seeing such a dignitary or prelate, using his authority or rule
   solely to the Glory of God, neither seeking nor desiring his own,
   everywhere. This we can recognise and see plainly in the holy life,
   which the Bishop, whose feast we are keeping to-day, led on earth; and
   therefore we sing of him from the Psalter: "In My Name shall his honour
   be exalted"; as though God said of him: "Not in his name, because he
   neither seeks nor desires that, but in My Name shall his horn be
   exalted and lifted up."

   Now, in another place, the prophet says of God: "His name alone is
   exalted." Nothing is more displeasing or abhorrent to God than the
   longing for a great name. This infirmity, in many men, is often so much
   hidden and concealed that they are scarcely conscious of the great
   danger in which they stand. It often comes to pass that they even
   despise it, and imagine that they have a right that people should hold
   them in high esteem; they cannot endure that anyone should say anything
   or do anything that affects or touches their honour, or slights them in
   any way. David says of such secret sins: "From my secret sins cleanse
   me, O Lord." that means, cleanse me from the desire to have a great
   name. He says also: "Let not the foot of (that is the desire and
   longing for) pride come to me, let not the hand move me. There the
   workers of iniquity have fallen." God will not regard anything of
   thine, however good it may be. St Chrysostom says: "Forsake thy great
   name and then thou wilt easily overcome torture and suffering." If by
   some means God could induce man to feel as great, bitter and
   ignominious a contempt for himself, as the haughty, self-satisfied
   pride in which he had previously indulged, God would have obtained that
   which He desired; for all the things by which God corrects men inwardly
   take place that man may be humbled and abased in himself. If God does
   not succeed in bringing this to pass by such correction and abasement,
   He often allows these, His Friends, to fall into open shame and
   trouble, that they will be pitied by all men and thus be abased in
   their own eyes.

   Now, know, that when a man is too highly exalted by other men, and more
   virtue or holiness is ascribed to him, and his name is held in greater
   repute than it ought in truth to be in the sight of God, on account of
   some secret sin which is known only to him and to God; see, this great
   and good repute can only cause him injury, shame and pain, either here
   or in another world. For this undeserved spiritual gift of honour
   offered to him, must necessarily be changed in this life into shame and
   mockery, if he is to preserve it otherwise in eternity. If a man
   neither glories in his good name, nor is well-pleased with himself (for
   if he be, it will be very harmful to him, and will avenge itself on
   him), his name will be very useful, and a blessing and help to him; for
   then it is pure and beneficial. Even though he have a great name, he
   may be preserved by the Grace of God, in fear and humility, while he
   acknowledges his own vileness, weakness and sinfulness. If he thinks
   nothing of himself on account of all these virtues, but only that he is
   a messenger and an unworthy servant and guardian of these gifts of God,
   then he looks upon himself as no better or worthier than he was before,
   but carries on his office simply to the glory of God and of the Holy
   Church, and that he may advance the salvation of his fellow men. See,
   how very fruitful this is in the sight of God, and what great blessings
   it brings to other men. Even when he is called great before worldly
   men, yet he is none the less nothing in the sight of God; and he feels
   in his heart, that he is one who desires the lowest place and possesses
   it at all times; and if he were deposed from his position or his
   honours, it would not trouble him, because to him all things are alike.

   Dear children, for this reason the great repute of the superior clergy
   is very dangerous, and should be shunned or at least despised; because,
   when a man does not live up to that which he is anxious to be
   considered, and glories or rejoices unworthily in his name and honour,
   hereafter, either here or in another world, he will have to pay or
   atone for it with shame and sorrow, because his name was greater than
   his life in the sight of God.

   But when some men are faint-hearted, desponding at times, on account of
   their great reputation, fearing that their intentions are not quite
   pure, and that they often think more of the dignity of their name than
   of the command of obedience, yet, none the less, they ought to do good,
   because at all times men ought to do good, and even if their intentions
   are not quite pure, yet they ought to strive to amend; and then their
   virtues will become deserving. But, if a great name is blazed abroad,
   and a man does good work to please others, or from evil motives, then
   he will become proud and arrogant, and be led astray by the desire to
   do anything more, unless he is called great; for in all his works he
   will desire the praise of men, and to be seen of them. He thus devotes
   himself in good earnest to show his ecclesiastical ability and his
   moral conduct, chiefly in the presence of other people, so that he may
   be seen of them. He will do nothing unless he can do it far better than
   all others, that he may deserve the prize.

   Now, we can recognize the men who stand in this evil ground of
   man-pleasing, and not in faith, hope and the love of God, by noticing
   that they do not trust in the Love of God; they do not believe in Him,
   and they dare not believe that He is the faithful Helper of His true
   servants. Therefore they soon begin to doubt and mistrust God, and are
   in great danger of the very worst that can happen to them. These people
   may be discovered by telling them to do something for which they are
   unfit or are incapable. They cannot be induced to do it, for they fear
   that other people will notice their incapacity or unskilfulness, and
   will therefore think less of them, and consider them as small as they
   really are. All the Scriptures do not suffice to prove to them the
   great faithfulness of God, which He vouchsafes to those who trust in
   Him, so that they may be ready to leave all to God and to trust in Him,
   and, for His sake, to allow their unskilfulness to be made manifest.
   No, ten preachers would not be able to prove this to them; and
   therefore they continue in their hard hartedness and pride, and are
   unable to win any true love from right-minded men. If they would only
   forsake this, they might be at once enlightened with a new, peculiar,
   divine and joyful Light, which would cause their old wicked sadness to
   vanish quite away, and would gain a satisfying love for them from all
   the men with whom they have to deal and with whom they dwell. But,
   because they do not act thus, they must remain in a state of bitterness
   and malice towards their neighbours, so that all brotherly love is pain
   to them, and all good and loving deeds torment and trouble them.
   Therefore they are forced to seek for solitude, to separate themselves
   from mankind, that they may neither see nor hear anything from which
   trouble or sorrow could arise. They also take care not to trouble
   themselves about anyone, and imagine that they will thus attain to
   peace. Now, dear children, this is not the path of peace; for such men
   have much more unrest, and wicked, envious disquiet, malice and
   condemnation, the more they withdraw themselves and keep away from
   other men, hoping to be at peace in secret. For the wicked Enemy dwells
   in these evil, proud hearts, and never allows peace to enter there.

   But if these men are ever to attain to true peace and joy, they must
   learn to know their own hearts, and to cleanse them from all pride and
   self-righteousness; and, in so far as it is seemly, to make known their
   weaknesses, vileness and uselessness to others, desiring to be
   accounted vile, useless and weak, exercising themselves therein as long
   and as much as they feel in their hearts that they have an evil desire
   for human praise. If they practice this, they will attain to true peace
   and love, and gain a taste for the skill in their occupations; but
   otherwise never. If I were to allow them to confess for three hours
   every day, it would not help them at all; they would still remain in a
   state of disquiet and sadness, hating their neighbours. The more they
   confessed, the more the Evil Spirit would find cause for their anger,
   hatred, envy, sorrow and gloom, in themselves and towards others. He
   even sometimes seeks out things, and brings up what was said or done
   ten, twenty or thirty years ago; and, by the thought of them, leads
   such men further astray than he had succeeded in doing by the very
   things themselves. They will have to endure this as long as they will
   not acknowledge their weakness, but desire the praise of men on account
   of their outward deeds and customs.

   Now, people say that they must set others a good example and anger
   none. I say unto you, that if ye wish to set a good example to the
   people with whom ye consort, and to anger none, ye must show yourselves
   to be what ye are in truth, and let yourselves be known in truth, as
   far as is needful. Be pure, long-suffering and decorous, and, in kindly
   love, desire to be scorned and rejected, and then all will be well with
   you.

   Oh! children, these men have been neglected in their youth; they have
   never been well disciplined by scorn and much opposition, but they have
   been allowed, at times, to see how pleased people were with what they
   did or seemed to be. Thus they became hardened, so that afterwards they
   could neither do nor wish to do anything for which they would not
   receive praise or fame; while nothing could be got out of them except
   by prayers and entreaties.

   Oh! all this is most evil and pitiful; for these are they of whom the
   Lord says: "They have received their reward." Those who praise them are
   accounted murderers before God; for they deceive and lead astray
   foolish men, who were good-hearted, inclined to give glory to God, and
   well able to do so, but who become hard-hearted, desiring human praise,
   thinking well of themselves and full of self-satisfaction, which causes
   the eternal death of the soul, its rejection and banishment from true
   eternal life and from all the Saints. These betrayers act thus, that by
   fame and praise they may bring round these foolish hearts to their
   will, that they may become all the more diligent in subduing temporal
   things to themselves, and thus to contrive that all may tend to their
   own advantage, for which they are hoping.

   Oh! children, the desire for temporal things causes a real alienation
   from eternal things. If we sought first those things that would be
   useful to us in eternity, and which would further our salvation,
   undoubtedly God would not only abstain from withdrawing temporal things
   from us, but He would also give them back to us with increase. But, as
   it is, for the sake of a small advantage, we lose and betray these
   simple hearts, in the evil desire for human praise and our own
   gratification, which is the evil source of pride, and which God always
   resists. He never receives such men into favour, but He allows them to
   be driven by the Evil One into all kinds of wickedness; for there is
   scarcely a sin which is so inhuman that they are not tempted by it; and
   all arises from this devilish root of inner, proud self-satisfaction,
   which was not checked at first. Therefore, from youth up it has taken
   such deep root, that, in old age, it is hard work striving to cast out
   this infirmity.

   Therefore, simple men who are striving to advance, must be well
   guarded, and instructed that they must do nothing in order to gain
   praise, but must do all to the glory of God, Who needeth not our
   praise, but Who humbled Himself, even unto Death, to gain us strength,
   knowledge, prudence, and many other gifts and graces, that we may work
   out our own salvation. Children, it would be far better and more
   charitable to rebuke these men, and to teach them to regard themselves
   as little or nothing in their own eyes, training them in the humility
   they rejected; for then they might become great and holy men. But by
   praise and fame they are spoilt; so that, later, when they are old, and
   we shall be anxious to teach them, they will have become so established
   in this evil, wicked state, that no instruction for their good can turn
   them. They think those who do not praise them, hateful; and they are
   often discontented and insubordinate to their superiors and father
   confessors, and remain in a state of sadness, gloom, and false
   suspicion. They imagine they are not sufficiently considered; no one
   asks after them; and they constantly refer to the great deeds that they
   have done, to their industry and so on. They say they have been very
   useful, and they tell this to other people, and complain and almost
   murmur if no one asks after them.

   See, dear children, how all this misery is brought upon these foolish
   people by praise and flattery, so that their salvation even is placed
   in great jeopardy. He, who in this life cannot bring himself to feel
   peaceful, friendly, brotherly love for his neighbour, and who cannot be
   truly resigned and obedient to his superiors, is in great danger of
   losing eternal salvation. He, who is not acting thus, will not be
   helped by all his fastings, vigils, his singing and reading, his
   prostrations, mortification of the flesh, or anything else, however
   important it may seem. It would be far better and more useful for men
   to set aside all visible and outward works and discipline, till they
   had learnt the true and real virtues of love and resignation, and had a
   real desire to do all only for the love of God and of their neighbours.

   Now, mark further, as soon as a man realizes that he does not care for
   a grand name and position, but wishes to remain always concealed, and
   longs for humiliation and simplicity, and to be cast off and left
   unnoticed among other men, then God will do great things in his name.
   If the man seeks for no honour, and does not desire a great name and
   position, and, when no one is willing to show him any honour, he is
   ready to accept it all and desires to take the lowest place always,
   then all will be well with him. See, then his great name amongst men is
   no longer harmful to him; but he must learn also to conquer himself in
   this, and be ready to hear it, so that he may gain his neighbour. For
   this also is a step in that inner death, that he may be able to endure
   this position, and learn to give up his own will even in this. He will
   most certainly find that he is greater in God; and God will enlighten
   him and fill him with Divine Light. Thus it will be found that all this
   is quite incomprehensible to the human understanding of those who have
   not walked in this way before.

   But, because it is a great thing to stand upright in this way, so also
   is it very dangerous to fall in it and to take pleasure in one's own
   name. Therefore, every man should flee from it as long as he can or
   may, that he may not be exalted in this life; for he whom God calls to
   it in this life, must pass through many a dark way that is unknown to
   him. He rests only in the hope of God and in confident faith, and says:
   "Lord, I will serve Thee; therefore I trust that there is no deception
   in all that is placed before me in this wonderful way, and I will bear
   it ever." At times faith, hope and love fail him, and he is only
   sustained by his intention in all things. At times he is still
   conscious of, and loves in the two lowest grades, in nature and in
   intelligent converse, for then love lies quite concealed in the lowest
   grade. For as long as he is still faithful to God in some degree in the
   resignation of nature and speech, and is content to be resigned, while
   he falls into no ill-placed comfort in vice or sensuality, by which he
   could rid himself of suffering, all will be well. But if he seeks for
   gratification in the things of sense, or gives way to outward troubles,
   even though they be good and religious, that he may be freed from the
   pressure, he will bind and tear love; and then from time to time he
   will fall away from love, though he does not know it himself. But, most
   assuredly, if he stands firm in this, and is true to God in this
   mysterious resignation, see, he has gained the highest stage of love,
   though he knows it not. When he has passed through this, his heart is
   quite freed from self; he brings forth much fruit even in the sight of
   other people, and he finds that God is dwelling lovingly in him and he
   in God in all things.

   It would be better for us to try this than to talk about it. He who
   does not taste it and try it, can never understand what it really is to
   possess God in truth. May God help us to honour and extol His Name
   only, and not our own, while we truly depreciate ourselves in this
   world in true resignation. Amen.

  SERMON XXXIII

      On the Feast of a Holy Confessor

   That no one should trust to outward deeds done in the body, to customs
   and ceremonies; that is religious customs and gestures, in the hope
   that he can reform himself by them alone; but, that before all things,
   man should use all diligence in learning to know the very ground of his
   heart, and to die to all evil inclinations and infirmities.

   Lucerna corporis tui est oculus tuus.

   "The light of thy body is thine eye."

   To-day, dear children, we commemorate the memory of N., that holy
   Servant of God, who, by his Christian life, showed forth, confessed and
   spread abroad, the praise and glory of Jesus Christ; not only by the
   good example and pattern which he set by his virtuous life and
   character, but also within; for his heart, mind and spirit, rested in
   true resignation and in the pure ground of his mortified senses,
   willing always to serve God diligently, and to please Him only. This,
   verily, was a truly religious and holy life.

   Now, ye must notice that there are many, in these days, who are called
   religious and appear to be so, but who exert themselves to the utmost
   with wrong things. They submit to severe discipline, by means of which
   they hope, through grace, to become different from that which they are
   by nature. They fast, they watch, they pray and confess often; they
   receive the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, meditating on the highly
   exalted Sufferings of Christ, they do works of mercy, and often seek
   for absolution; or other exercises of that kind, whatever they may be.
   Yet, by means of all this discipline they are not changed, they waste
   their strength and power away from God, gaining no praise nor any
   benefit for their souls, but rather bringing themselves down thereby to
   hell. For they do not look into themselves, and do not learn to know
   their own hearts; and, when they ought to be advancing, they are losing
   ground. They think much of themselves, and yet they are nothing and are
   serving God heedlessly. They think they are seeking God, but they are
   not; and when they thus go on, living carelessly according to their
   undisciplined desires, allowing their imagination to be excited by
   their senses, none of their actions can make them any better. The older
   they grow and the longer they live thus, the more impatient they will
   be and unguarded against sin in word and deed; and this will be the
   case, too, with those who look for high places in the monasteries. This
   is the result of serving God after their own pleasure, and with
   ill-regulated desires. When they feel inclined to do good works, they
   devote themselves thereto, often beyond their power; at one time they
   will do one thing, at another time another; and then they imagine that
   the one helps them and the other hinders them. Thus they go carelessly
   from one exercise to another, imagining that all gratifies their
   natural desires; they are well pleased; but when they are not satisfied
   inwardly, they imaging that nothing is helpful to them. Thus they
   become inconstant, no discipline pleases them for long; for, however
   they may live, they will never reach their true ground; for, to
   whatever they may devote themselves in such an unskillful way, and
   however good their intentions may be, they will yet be deceived,
   although they allow themselves to imagine that God only is in all their
   thoughts. Who is there who wishes to serve the Evil Spirit? This is
   surely desired by none. It is not our wish; we will not have him for
   our master; and yet we do his will. For, as long as we serve God only
   in outward works, we have not begun to serve Him really in truth and
   with real devotion; for the right foundation of a perfect Christian
   life does not consist only of external works, though they are a help,
   but much more of good work in the heart, by which sin is avoided and
   virtue brought forth.

   Again, I say, ye may find men in monasteries, who keep the strict rules
   of their Order by external deeds done in the body. There are men, too,
   in the world, who torment their bodies by watchings, fastings and other
   kinds of discipline; who give alms with open hands, but who do not keep
   the ground of their hearts, cleansing it from all sin. While they are
   doing all these great external works, they are angry, envious and
   proud. They slander their neighbours while they strive to gain a good
   report for themselves; and they do other such-like things, which show
   that they are in the bonds of the Evil Spirit. These men deceive
   themselves one with another. They imagine that they will be justified
   and saved by their outward works only; but this will never be the case
   in eternity. Such men may well be compared to images, which look like
   gold outside, but which are stone or wood within. Our Lord compares
   them in the Gospel to the sepulchers of the dead, which are beautiful
   outwardly, but within are full of dead men's bones. Therefore, I say:
   It is of no use for a man to fast, to pray and to do other religious
   works, unless his mind is cleansed and purified from all wickedness. It
   is seldom, alas, that man lives uprightly; and yet it is not so
   impossible, if he would only use a little care. That on which
   everything depends he will not attend to, while he hopes to obtain
   great blessedness from that on which nothing depends; so he has great
   difficulty and hard work, and seeks long for God, and yet seldom finds
   Him aright, and as He ought to be found. These are the sins which cause
   men so often to fail; they strive after impossibilities; and that which
   they might do, and which no one could hinder them from doing, that they
   will not do; for they have neither love nor liking for it, while they
   would gladly have that which is impossible. They set themselves to do
   that which they like or fancy, with uncontrolled love and desire,
   following the guidance of the outer man, and saying they act thus,
   because they do not know what they ought to do or to leave undone. They
   might soon find out, why they spike thus, if they would only strive to
   walk uprightly in the way of truth and righteousness. It does not arise
   from anything that they do no know; for then their consciences would
   not punish them for any neglect; they would be doing right, as far as
   they knew, whether it were much or little, and God would not require
   anything more of them; for, if He did, He would give them more
   knowledge.

   Lastly, give heed to this, dear children. A man, who by grace desires
   to be other than he is by nature, must strive after that spirituality,
   which contains within itself the righteousness which must be the
   portion of every Christian man; for true righteousness demands true
   devotion. Now what is true devotion? Some people imagine that true
   devotion consists of sweet longings; and at times it may, but not
   always; for sometimes men naturally experience such sweetness, and thus
   many men err and are deceived. True devotion is a willing submission to
   the service of God; and a truly spiritual man will carefully examine
   his own heart, and search out all his thoughts, words and works, and
   all his life, learning thus to know his own faults. He can scarcely
   fail to discover something, whatever it may be; and if he desires to be
   freed from his fault, he must learn to acknowledge it; then follows
   repentance for the fault that he has acknowledged. Man must search
   diligently in order to find out how he can best free himself from his
   old life, destroy all vice in himself, and devote himself earnestly to
   the keeping of God's commands. These are not ordered alike for the
   clergy and for simple laymen; but more is required of the clergy than
   of the laity, and they must also be more strict. They must also take
   their part in ordinary life with the Holy Christian Church, and
   according to the observance of their Order or religious life. These
   things are more necessary than any amount of severe discipline and
   hardship, in fastings, vigils, labours, and so on, which are all like a
   sign-post pointing to progress in spirituality, but which are not in
   themselves true and real religion. Many men may, indeed, be found who
   exercise themselves therein, but who are, nevertheless, full of evil,
   self-willed, disobedient, proud, angry, and so on. God grant that we
   may all give ourselves to true devotion. Amen.

  SERMON XXXIV

      On the Feast of a Holy Virgin

   How wise and prudent virgins should adorn themselves, both outwardly
   and inwardly, that they may be received at the Eternal Marriage of
   Christ and may enter in. Of the noble and precious virtue of true and
   lowly Love, to which we can attain only by resignation, suffering and
   love.

   Quinque ex eis erant fatuae, et quinque prudentes

   "Five of them were foolish and five wise."

   Our dear Lord likens the Kingdom of Heaven to ten virgins, who took
   their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom and the bride. Five
   of them were foolish and five were wise. They are very unlike each
   other; for the foolish live after the flesh, in the world and in
   temptation. The wise look upon all these things, and live after the
   spirit. The wise virgins control themselves in all things, to which the
   foolish give no heed, both outwardly and inwardly.

   There are five things which are necessary to all for the control of the
   outer man, if they desire to be like the five wise virgins. The first
   is moderation in eating and drinking, in clothes, in vigils, in
   fasting, and in all the other things that nature needs, and that must
   be partaken of to supply the needs of nature, but not for the
   furtherance of sin. The second is simplicity in all things. They should
   wear rough, plain clothes; be simple in their coming and going; firm
   and simple in their behaviour; and modest in all things.

   Thirdly, they should avoid all foolish company, especially the company
   of those who speak vain words, and who are scrupulous about many
   things.

   Fourthly, they must live by the labour of their own hands, and must not
   be idle, even though they be rich; for idleness is the door to all
   uncleanness.

   Fifthly, they must be industrious and always at work. They must keep
   control over their senses and all their members, keeping aloof and
   turning away from all the temptations that may befall them, but which
   they must earnestly withstand, and to which they must never consent.
   There is nothing that will help them better in this, than making their
   temptations, humbly and fully, to some holy man, taking counsel with
   him, and submitting themselves earnestly and discreetly to bodily
   penance, with fervent prayer to God. All men are accounted foolish
   virgins before God, who do not thus govern the outer man.

   Now, it becomes wise virgins to adorn themselves in the inner man. The
   foundation of this is lowliness of mind, for they are to become the
   Sisters of God by doing the Will of God; therefore they must not
   condemn others by saying that those who live in wedlock are wicked.
   They must not desire to please any one by their spiritual virtues, but
   God only; otherwise they will be like unto the Pharisees. They are not
   commanded to keep their virginity, but they are commanded to be humble.
   A proud virgin, in the sight of God, is a thousand times worse and more
   impure than a humble married woman. A virgin does not hate any one, but
   must love all people; she must not think much of self, but she must
   always keep herself in fear and trembling. When sins begin to grow and
   give pleasure, love and all other virtues grow cold. A virgin can only
   follow the Lamb of God in all places whithersoever He goeth, if she is
   truly pure and humble; for, if she is spotted by pride or any other
   gross sin, religious married people stand far above her.

   Virginity has its origin in God Himself. The Angels have learnt it from
   God; for it is found in Heaven, and will remain there for ever, after
   the Judgment Day. When these virgins have risen again from the dead,
   they will not be given in marriage, but will be like unto the Angels of
   God and eternally united with God. They are loosed from all men, and
   are united only with God, that they may bring forth eternal fruit. They
   have great power over the Devil; they alone sing the new song that no
   one else can sing. God has set His Throne in these daughters who have
   thus been trained. It is a joy to Him to be with them, if they live
   after the inner man in humility, chastity and resignation, and with
   hearts subdued to the Love of God.

   No one can attain to the Love of God without humility; and that is a
   gift of God above all temporal gifts. Humility brings true peace to the
   heart of man; for no one is quarrelsome or sinful, but he who lacks
   peace. If a man were truly humble he would never sin again. Mary could
   not sin because she was truly humble; and wherever God finds humility,
   there He does great things. Augustine says: "The lowliest on earth is
   also the holiest."

   These are the marks of a humble man. He always learns first to know
   himself, and acknowledges himself unworthy of all gifts. He counts
   himself unworthy to have been thought of by God, and to have been made
   a man. He confesses that he is unworthy that God should constantly feed
   and preserve him, therefore he thanks God unceasingly, and in great
   humility, for all these gifts. He neither exalts, nor extols, nor
   praises himself in anything, whatever it may be; but acknowledges that
   he is ever more and more indebted to God for all his gifts, while in
   all things God is his first and last thought. No wise virgin will have
   two aims or intentions in anything, so as to be thinking of God and
   also of something temporal at the same time; but that which she loves
   as well as God, must be a help to her, and be ordained to the Glory of
   God, under God; and it must be a help to her in coming to God. See,
   this is a wise virgin and none else. Man must love God more than all
   His messengers whom He sends forth and whom we call His gifts.

   A wise virgin thinks no more of herself on account of her gifts, than
   of what she was before she was born. Whatever may be the gifts given
   her by God, He gives Himself to her with them, for here especially He
   is unhindered by man, and therefore He can work as He will. Therefore
   God perfects her in the very best way; God, of His Goodness, cannot
   help doing this, when He finds that she is faithful to Him, and that
   she gives Him a dwelling-place, suffers Him, follows Him and works with
   Him without any self love. A humble man thinks himself unworthy to fill
   the place he is in, and, with whomsoever he may be, he always takes the
   lowest place; he desires the most miserable part of everything, even in
   necessary things. He complains to no one of his suffering; neither does
   he complain to God, even of his suffering or of anything; but, in fear
   and trembling, when the suffering is very great, he takes all things as
   from the Hand of God. Therefore he does not know how to complain of any
   creatures, however unworthily they may treat him. Neither does he find
   fault with any one who does him harm, for he takes all things as from
   God, and as therefore right; for God does not inflict anything upon any
   one that is not for his good. Thus these virgins live and die without
   offense.

   Mark, this is the shortest way to come to God and to the company of the
   wise virgins; and they who do not take it are among the number of the
   foolish virgins, although they do not believe it. All who desire,
   truly, to be in God, must be foolish in their own sight and in the
   sight of other people; for he who desires to save his soul must lose
   and forsake vain glory in this life; and he who desires to attain to
   true and humble love must learn to hold fast three things--resignation,
   suffering and love. He who would learn resignation must not only
   forsake great sins, both outwardly and inwardly, but also, in inner
   spiritual things, he must not seek to please himself by his own good
   things, such as fasting, watching, praying, reading, thinking, or by
   consolation, sweetness, experience, knowledge, hunger and desire for
   reward after the Holy Sacrament. He must be self-controlled in
   exaltation, in visions, in contemplation, and so on. Then he ought to
   think that there is not a more miserable, unpleasing, cold and careless
   man than himself, and yet he must not consciously omit anything, or
   seek for freedom from any of his duties. See, a man thus becomes
   nothing in himself; for his self-will, wisdom, good opinion of self,
   and self-pleasing, and enjoyment in good works are all lost. The more
   thoroughly this takes place, the truer it is; and this casting down of
   self brings him to God; for God is an Abyss of humility; and in deep
   humility his soul lays hold on God, and God unites Himself with his
   soul. Therefore this man is transformed in God, and is just as though
   he had become another man. This is the work of the Holy Ghost, Who
   indwells and governs him.

   The second point is suffering; and in order to be humble, ye must
   suffer all scoffing patiently and calmly, as far as ye can, both in
   love and scorn, with others, or in opposition, equally or unequally. Ye
   must endure contempt, disparagement, and such-like, in gain or in loss,
   outwardly or inwardly, as it may happen, and whoever may cause it.
   Though, at times, it may seem to you, as far as ye can judge, that it
   is neither the best nor the worst course, or that according to your
   ideas it may hinder your virtue or salvation, yet suffer simply and
   willingly as well as you can. Trust in God; and, though ye do not
   understand why all things have happened, yet bear all patiently; and
   then ye will bring forth the fruits of humility. Your own good opinion
   of self and your wisdom will wither away, and all things will happen to
   you for the best, if ye will only endure. And, though at times, it may
   seem to you that ye will be injured thereby, both in the temporal and
   spiritual things that ye have undertaken yourselves, yet by this humble
   and enduring resignation ye will be a hundred times further advanced in
   God in real and true virtue.

   The third point is love, which waits on humility; for love is nowhere
   so nobly exercised as in patient suffering. Though it is true that by
   love man may rise so high that he can embrace God by union of will, yet
   it is true that God descends to the resigned and suffering man with all
   that He is; and there He is embraced by the loving soul, and He
   embraces it again and absorbs it into Himself. Thus the soul loses
   itself, and returns again to the Source from whence it came, and knows
   assuredly here, even in this life, as far as it possible, that
   hereafter it will enjoy Him for ever. He, whose portion this is, needs
   real humility, that he may learn to see God here also, as far as it is
   permitted.

   Then, three things are necessary. First, man's intentions must be pure
   and clear; he must desire nothing else but God only; love nothing else
   but God only; seeking only to please and love Him aright. See, such as
   these have a true vision in this life.

   The second thing is, that those who desire to see the blessings of God,
   must be ready to bear all and endure all in love; they must humble
   themselves from the very bottom of their hearts; they must not exalt
   themselves, however much God may reveal to them, and however secret
   these things may be.

   The third thing is earnestness and diligence in spiritual exercises,
   that man may lift up his soul to God, in whatever way or whatever form
   is most pleasing and helpful to him, either in dwelling in the Humanity
   of God, His Divinity, or the Holy Trinity; the Hidden Life of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, or of our dear Lady, or of other Saints, and how they led
   their daily lives; for every syllable of Holy Scripture has a divine
   meaning which can be drawn from it. If a man does these three things,
   he ought to be able to obtain from God all that he needs--if his
   intentions are pure, and he is ready to suffer and endure in love and
   humility, and is earnest in his religious exercises. A good
   disposition, a strong head, and a yielding, subtle mind are very
   helpful. A man who can succeed in this, and who receives grace from
   God, will make great progress in his spiritual life.

   All virtue and all virtuous deeds depend on these six points. The first
   is true humility; the second patient suffering; the third perfect
   resignation in all things; the fourth real love; the fifth a divine
   intention in all things; the sixth earnestness in religious exercises.
   That thus we may all be wise virgins, may God help us. Amen.

  SERMON XXXV

    At the Dedication of a Church

      The First Sermon

   Points to a renewal of the outer and inner man, and shows how man must
   deny himself and die to all to which he cleaves and is attached by
   nature; and how God will then make His dwelling-place in him. A Parable
   of the three kinds of Wings on which God flies and hovers over us; and
   of the wish to see God in the most noble way, both in time and in
   Eternity.

   In domu tua oportet me manere.

   "This day I must abide in thy house."

   Dear children, this is the consecration-day of this House of God; and
   all the ceremonial of the Holy Christian Church directs us all,
   spiritually, to the inner man, in whom, verily, consecration and a true
   godly reconciliation should always find place. Therefore this outward
   ceremonial should call and admonish us to prepare ourselves in
   sincerity and truth, that God may truly and perfectly take up His abode
   with us. The consecration of a church means much the same as a renewal;
   and this renewal ought always to be taking place in the inner man. The
   man who truly receives it must renounce all his natural tendencies, and
   repress and give up all to whom he may cleave, whether friends or
   relations. All must be given up, whatever it may be, that comes to him
   naturally from without, and also all in which nature finds joy, comfort
   or delight, in thought, word, or deed. Bodily discipline is also
   helpful and good, such as fasting and watching, if man's nature is able
   to bear it. But this I say unto you, the wickedness of our nature is so
   concealed, and is always seeking its own so secretly, that we often
   take pleasure, in that which we imagine we are only doing because it is
   absolutely necessary. Therefore man must always seek most diligently to
   be master of his outer animal nature. He must do this with the utmost
   diligence, though it is very hard to nature to die to all excessive
   delight in eating and drinking, in seeing and hearing, in coming and
   going, in words and works. I say unto you that if all their excesses,
   we should be as sweet-smelling incense unto God, as it is written: "We
   are the good odour of Christ." When all these natural hindrances are
   quite done away, then that which is written in the Psalter takes place
   in man: "Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings
   of the wind." This means, that when man has quite killed all earthly
   desires in himself, then the Eternal God makes His abode in him. What
   then do we find written of the three kings of wings on which our Lord
   walks? The first is on the wings of a dove; the second on eagle's
   wings; the third on the wings of the wind.

   The wings of a dove are those upright men, who walk in holy innocence,
   without any gall, bitterness, jealousy, or intercourse with other men;
   therefore these simple-minded men are quiet, gentle, and good, and
   follow the meek and gentle Lamb, Jesus Christ, the Eternal Son of God,
   our Lord. Therefore our Lord is with them in all their ascents, in
   their desires, their love and their intentions. Secondly, our Lord
   walks on the wings of the eagle; for the eagle flies so high that none
   can see him. The eagle is the pure man, formed in the Image of God, who
   flies up with all his strength, both outwardly and inwardly, to the
   secret places of God. When man strives with all his might and main, in
   the inner and outer man, he flies up so high in knowledge and love,
   that no merely human sensual power can attain to him. Our dear Lord
   also soars on these noble wings. Thirdly, our Lord walks on the wings
   of the wind; for the wind is so swift and fast that ye know not whence
   it cometh nor whither it goeth. Children, this wind is the most
   interior and sublime man, moulded and formed in the Image of God. This
   pure man is so far above all knowledge, that all man's reason and all
   his works cannot attain nor reach up to Him, because He is so far above
   the mind of man. This interior God-man, formed in the Image of God,
   flies back to His Divine Source and to His first condition before the
   Creation; and there the pure spirit becomes the Light of Lights. To
   some extent all other lights are extinguished in this Light, for all
   natural and all imparted light that ever lighted man becomes darkness.
   The sun obscures the light of all the stars in heaven when it is
   shining most brightly; and so, when the Divine Light shines into the
   depths of the soul, it obscures all the created lights that have ever
   shone in man. Then the Spirit, which is in the Form of God, shines so
   brightly into man's soul, that He is like darkness unto the spirit into
   which He shines, from the excessive brightness of the Divine Light. For
   the understanding of all creatures, as compared with this Divine Light,
   is like the eyes of swallows compared with the pure, bright sunshine.
   For, if thou desirest, with weak eyes, to gaze on the disk of the sun,
   the sun will seem like darkness to thy gaze because of the surpassing
   brightness of the sun, and also because of the weakness of thine eyes.
   Therefore a heathen teacher has said: "After other lights God seems
   like darkness to the soul, because we acknowledge Him in the ignorance
   of our minds." It is a great disgrace to us Christian men, that a
   heathen should have understood this! What are we poor men about?

   We read about consecration in the Gospel account of Zacharias
   (Zacchaeus). He would gladly have seen our Lord, only he was too little
   of stature. But what did he do? He climbed up a barren fig tree. This
   is what a devout man does who desires to see Him, Who has done all
   these wonders in him; but he is too short and too small. What must he
   do then? He must climb up into the high and barren fig tree; and that
   is all that is written for us. It is a constant dying to the outward
   parts of man's nature, and living wholly in the inner man in which God
   the Lord walks, as ye have already heard. Therefore this is looked upon
   as the greatest folly by the wise men of the world; and it even comes
   to pass that famous priests may be found who have two hundred florins
   worth of books, and are so pleased with them, that they read them most
   diligently; and yet these wise men of the world imagine that the life
   and being of these whole men is nothing but mockery and folly. No, I
   say unto you, the life of these good men is a noble and blessed folly;
   for they are the chosen of our merciful God, as the Eternal Son of God,
   Jesus Christ has said: "I confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
   earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,
   and hast revealed them to little ones."

   Amongst many other things, these secret hidden things were revealed to
   St Hildegarde; and therefore two little pictures were painted in her
   book. One figure is clad in a blue dress; and it has no eyes; but its
   blue dress is full of eyes, which signify the holy fear of God. This is
   not the fear that ye call fear, but it is that uncertain, diligent
   examination of self, which the noble, pure spirit of the man, formed in
   the Image of God, should carry on in all places, and in all his ways,
   words and deeds. Therefore this noble image, formed like unto God, is
   without a face, and without eyes; for it wholly forgets itself, and
   knows not whether it is loved or hated, praised or blamed. Then it has
   no hands; for it stands there bare and empty of all kinds of delight,
   in true and humble resignation.

   The other image, placed by the side of this one, is in a light dress
   and has uplifted hands; both are barefoot. This image has no head; and
   the Godhead, in pure bright gold, is above this image. It has no face;
   all is pure gold; and this signifies the unknown pure Godhead, which is
   poured forth over the image in the place of the head; for the pure
   Godhead is its head. This picture signifies poverty of spirit. The head
   of this picture is God Himself; and the whiteness of the clothing
   signifies innocency of conduct, insusceptibility, and pure bare
   resignation. These figures are both barefoot; and this signifies an
   absolute imitation of the true likeness of our Lord Jesus Christ. The
   blue dress signifies constancy; which means that man must not
   discipline himself to-day and sleep to-morrow; but that he must
   persevere unto the end, and with outstretched hands be ready always to
   do the Will of God in working and suffering. [29]

   I say unto you, this is the withered fig tree that all men must climb
   who wish to serve God, both in time and eternity, in the noblest way.
   For our Lord said to Zacchaeus: "Make haste to come down, for of all
   that thou hast thou mayest keep nothing, but thou must return again
   empty and bare into thine own nothingness; which means that thou must
   do nothing and be nothing; and then God will come into thine own house,
   and this must need be." When, however, thou hast got up into the fig
   tree, and Eternal Truth has enlightened thee in some measure, but thou
   hast not yet quite laid hold of it, nor it of thee, because thou still
   cleavest to something, then nature and the Grace of God are still
   contending within thee; and thou hast not yet attained to real and true
   resignation. Therefore, learn, that whatever nature does has always
   some flaws, and is therefore not quite perfect and pure, so that human
   nature in the man in the tree cries unto God; this is absolute
   self-surrender, and a constant casting off of nature, in all the ways
   in which man still clings to some possession of self. For bodie, which
   means "to-day," God must needs enter into thy house. Children, to-day
   salvation is come to this noble and holy house of God. That it may also
   come to us, may the eternal and blessed God grant. Amen.

   but the smaller one, now in the Ducal Library at Wiesbaden. It was
   brought from the monastery at Eybingen, where St Hildegarde lived.

  SERMON XXXVI

      At the Dedication of a Church

      The Second Sermon

   How the inner man may become a pure and holy House of Prayer. Of the
   tradesfolk, that is the wicked thoughts and infirmities, which carry on
   their business in this temple, and which may, peradventure, be of great
   use and service to man. What Prayer and Meditation are; also, of the
   three things by which man can enter into the Inner Kingdom: true Faith,
   a right Confession of God, and inner fervent Prayer.

   Domus mea, domus orationis vocabitur.

   "My house shall be called the house of prayer."

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Eternal Son of God has faithfully taught us
   here, what we must do that our hearts may be clean and pure houses of
   prayer; for man is really and truly a Holy Temple of God. But all
   traders must first be driven out of this Temple of God; that is all the
   fancies and imaginations which are not really of God; and also all
   delight in the creature and in our own will; therefore this temple must
   first be cleansed with tears of repentance and the Love of God, that it
   may be made clean and pure. For all temples are not made holy by being
   simply called the houses of God; but God only can make them holy.
   Therefore this Temple of God is a pure clean heart; and it is truly a
   Temple of God, where the Eternal God ever dwelleth in truth, when all
   that is unlike Him has been driven out and cast forth. Therefore I say
   unto you that God will not take up His abode in a temple which has not
   thus been cleared. Before a man has one pure thought of God in his
   heart, a thousand other thoughts enter in, about temporal things, which
   lead astray these pure thoughts of God and drive them away. It is in
   this sense that tradesfolk are referred to, and that we are told what
   they are. Therefore all men, who, of their own free will, live in
   pleasure, and in the gratification of the creature, and these traders.
   There is no doubt that the man, who desires that God Himself should
   dwell in him with His grace, and work His works in him, must
   especially, and of necessity, avoid all conformity to things that
   produce love, gratification and delight in the creature, and of which
   God is not the true Source. Therefore the man who says that ten chances
   of evil would not be more harmful than one; that is, that the secret
   love and friendship of ten men would be no more harmful to him than of
   one, would be saying a foolish thing; for it is easier to overcome and
   drive out one thing than ten. But there is one thing, especially, that
   ye ought to know; ten sins which a man looks upon as sins and
   confesses, are not so serious or so harmful to him as one single sin,
   of which he makes no account and does not look upon as sin, and in
   which he wickedly continues. Therefore man should always have a truly
   humble fear before God the Lord, on account of his unknown sins, and
   should humbly crave the mercy and goodness of God, and look upon
   himself as full of sin at all times; and then he will assuredly be
   helped by God's lovingkindness and grace. But the man who excuses
   himself, and goes on sinning deliberately, is in great danger of never
   coming to the Truth. Therefore guard yourselves from this as from
   eternal death; for the man who always thinks that all is right and well
   with him, is in a dangerous and terrible state. If ye were to ask the
   holiest man on earth if he had wept as much as he ought, he would say:
   "No, I have not wept a thousandth part of the tears that I ought to
   have wept. But I will now really begin to weep because of my sins and
   infirmities."

   Now, when the inner temple of man has been cleansed, and the traders
   have been driven out, that is, when thou hast driven out all that
   belongs to the creature with all its delights, and which thou hast
   formerly possessed with comfort, joy and pleasure; and if thou art not
   ready of thy own free will to take all back again, nor to possess it
   with pleasure; then thou art standing firm in truth and righteousness,
   and the traders have been driven out of thy temple.

   But when wicked traders come into thy temple again, drive them out at
   once. If they remain there for a time, against thy will and without thy
   permission, know, that it will not harm thee at all in the sight of
   God. For, if they stay there as long as they like, yet they will have
   to go out again, by the same door by which they entered. And, yet
   again, if they find any wickedness there, they will have to take it
   away with them, and purify this noble temple, if they entered it
   against man's will and without his permission. It cannot harm him, but
   it purifies, cleanses and prepares him for our Lord, like fine gold,
   which, the more it is heated by fire, the more precious and the purer
   it becomes. Thus it happens to the noble man in the reaction after his
   sufferings, his temptations and the assaults made upon him; for the
   impurer, the more wicked and the more terrible they are, the better
   will he be cleansed and purified. That which takes place in opposition
   to man's will can never cause sin unto death, but it prepares man for
   the great reward and enjoyment of eternal life. St Paul says: "For he
   that striveth is not crowned except he strive lawfully." He that
   endureth to the end shall be received with glory and honour. I say unto
   you, children, that anything done gainst my own free will, however
   wicked and impure it may be, cannot stain me, but will rather cleanse
   and purify me, and prepare me for our Lord and for especial grace.
   Therefore be of good courage, joyful, and not sad and gloomy, if, at
   times, wicked unclean thoughts befall you; however bad they may be,
   heed them not. For, if they come to you, in spite of your will and
   desire, let them go again. And if this happens especially in your
   prayers to God and communion with Him, leave them alone in the name of
   God, and bear these attacks and all this impurity right joyfully,
   humbly and resignedly as the Will of God. Know, children, that ye
   should bear all this humbly as the Will of God; for it may even happen
   that some things may be made known and revealed to you therein, which
   ye would never have known, had ye not passed along this way. But in
   this reaction and suffering man must not strive to help himself, either
   with words or deeds, but must rest only in God. He must bear all with a
   good heart, and must not trouble about it, either outwardly or
   inwardly. For, when it pleases our Heavenly Father, He can assuredly
   relieve thee and delight thee a thousandfold with Himself, after all
   these painful temptations. Therefore suffer cheerfully; do all things
   simply and in truth; and then, whatever comes, do not strive to help
   thyself. He who strives too much to help himself will assuredly lack
   help from God and from truth; for to the good man all things come from
   God without anything of his own, or a striving after his own salvation.

   Now, dear children, if the inner mind of man is to be God's holy House
   of Prayer, devotion must form part of prayer. What is devotion? It is
   devotio, that is, se vovere Deo, that is, inner communion with God and
   a longing after Eternity. When thou thus unitest thyself with God, or
   praisest Him, thou art devout; that is that wherever thou art, or
   whatever thou doest, thou must set thy thoughts on God Whose works they
   are. For it is not very terrible if thou art not always rejoicing and
   enjoying sweet intercourse, (for this is only as God pleases), so long
   as thou still hast the essence of devotion. This communion of man with
   God; this is higher and of more importance than all other works.

   Saint Hilary writes of three things by which man must enter into the
   Inner Kingdom. The first is true faith; the second is a right
   confession of God; and the third is devout and fervent prayer.

   Now, what is the faith meant here? for all Christians are not faithful.
   In the same way that there are many dead men in the churchyard, there
   are many and very different kinds of men, who seemed to be men who had
   living faith, and who yet in truth did not die, and are not dead in
   God. Now what is a pure and living faith? It is nothing less than a
   living desire for God, which springs forth from within, to God the Lord
   and to all that is of faith. Thus, when a man sees or hears of anything
   that pertains to the holy faith, either of the Eternal Godhead or the
   noble Manhood of our Lord, or of the highly-exalted, noble and glorious
   Trinity of God, he will find within himself a true and living faith
   therein, which clearly points out to him what God is, and at the same
   time makes everything plainer to him that it could by any teachers.
   Such a man lives and moves in the Inner Kingdom, where life verily
   wells up from its own spring.

   Now, unhappily, there are many men who cling, it is true, to the life
   of faith, but who may be troubled and may lose sight of it by a very
   small and insignificant cloud. It is just as though the light of the
   stars were a living and moving thing, which vanished away when a cloud
   passed over. Thus, in the same way, the cloud of sins may be very small
   and insignificant, which drives out of man the true light of faith,
   hiding it and depriving him of it. But, when a cloud of sins passes
   even over the chosen people of God (for all men are sinful), the
   Eternal and Divine Sun will force His way through to the lives of these
   men, so that they will speedily and immediately turn again to their
   original Source. Because they are rooted in the true garden of God they
   are quickly brought back; with good courage they force their way
   through all the things in which they cannot truly and clearly find God,
   and they always shun everything through which God could not find an
   entry into the very ground of their hearts. Therefore, however feebly
   and faintly man may cling to the life of faith, yet he will be
   preserved, if he be otherwise found faithful at the last, and would
   enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and, even though he were long
   delayed, yet he would be on the road to Eternal Life. Still, it is
   quite possible for such men to fall away into great and grievous sin,
   because they use ways and means of coming to themselves, that are very
   dangerous and unsafe; and therefore they are constantly dwelling in
   outward things, and become vain, empty, dry, cold, lukewarm, and so
   strange and unlike themselves, that they are much to be pitied in the
   sight of God. But living men, who truly live the life of truth, are
   conscious of this life within; they know the Inner Life and Truth of
   God, so that all that is divine which can befall these Friends of God,
   awakens this Inner Life, with earnest longings, and fervent Divine Love
   and delight, in the dearly loved Will of God. Now all this means
   simply, that these men are dwelling in the Inner Kingdom of God; they
   are partakers of the hidden Sweetness of God, which is concealed, and
   must be concealed, from all those who have never truly entered into
   this Inner Kingdom.

   Therefore, the second thing is the true and right confession of God
   which is found in this Kingdom. It need not be sought afar; it is to be
   found in this Kingdom, and reveals itself there. This Light shines
   therein, and there man truly comes into the Inner Kingdom, through
   Jesus Christ, Who is the true and rightful Door of entrance, through
   which men must enter if they are to come to perfection. Thus the saying
   may truly be used of them: "The Kingdom of God is within you." Here
   that pure and real Truth is to be found, which is unknown to all men
   who do not rest on this foundation, and who do not keep themselves free
   and apart from all creatures in whom God is not all in all. Here they
   find with their understanding that of which St Dionysius wrote and
   spoke: "What is there that is above all reason, and all thought and all
   understanding? The finding of light in Light."

   Now, dear children, the Masters in Paris read their big books
   diligently, and turn over the leaves; and all this is very good; but
   these other men read the true and living Book, wherein all things live.
   They turn over the Heaven and earth and read therein the surpassing
   wonders of God. They are before the holy, dear and exalted Angels of
   God in judgment; and therefore they first apprehend the highest Mission
   of the Holy and Exalted Trinity: How God the Father begat and is
   begetting His Son Jesus Christ throughout eternity; and how the Eternal
   Word, in God the Father, eternally reflects His Father's Heart; and how
   God the Holy Ghost proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son; and
   how the Holy Blessed Trinity pour Themselves forth on all Their chosen
   ones through time and eternity; and how again They enjoy in Themselves
   real and eternal blessedness. This is that blessedness of which Jesus
   Christ, the Son of God has said: "Now this is Eternal Life: that they
   may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast
   sent." Children, this is the true Life in the Inner Temple of God; and
   it is the noble, pure and true prize which is set before all the elect
   Friends of God. There is the High-Priest in his holy blessed Temple,
   there is the true, pure Presence of God, in Whom all things live and
   move, and there all suffering is done away.

   The man who truly experiences all this, knows well that there can be no
   doubt about it. All knowledge of it is quite unknown and concealed from
   the learned teachers of this world; but the chosen men of God have a
   full and clear knowledge and understanding of it. Therefore the man who
   learns most about it in this life, and who comes closest to this
   foundation, will be nearest to God in eternal life, and there will
   chiefly be found; while all such men will be the most blessed. The
   third thing mentioned by this holy man is devout prayer. This is the
   uplifting of the mind to God in eternal life, but in another sense.
   This prayer is the entrance into union of the created spirit with the
   uncreated Spirit of God, and is the result of a design formed by the
   Holy Godhead throughout eternity. These men are the true worshippers of
   God, who worship God the Father in spirit and in truth. This true
   worship is unceasingly demanded of all men by the Heavenly Father, as
   Jesus Christ said: "These are the true worshippers. They also receive
   that which they ask of the Heavenly Father, and they always find that
   which they seek and desire in their prayers, for their prayers are
   found and lost." The temple is lost here and the spirit, and all that
   of which we have been speaking. Now, how has all this been brought
   about? All has been poured forth into God and has become one spirit
   with God; as St Paul says: "He who is joined to the Lord is one
   spirit." What that is and how it comes to pass, it is easier to
   experience than to describe. All that has been said of it is as poor
   and unlike it as the point of a needle is to the heavens above. That we
   may all follow after this in a life of humility, may God help us. Amen.

Three thoughtful Instructions and some useful Advice on Confession
     __________________________________________________________________

  INSTRUCTION I

   The first instruction teaches us to confess, simply and sincerely, and
   to search out the very depths of our hearts.

   Dear children, I counsel, admonish and beseech you, that ye learn to
   confess all your sins, simply and sincerely unto God, and that ye learn
   to acknowledge that ye are verily and indeed guilty before Him, and
   that ye ponder over your sins in deep sorrow. Do not set yourselves to
   make a long outward confession; for that is of little use, and takes up
   the valuable time of the Confessors, causing them much trouble and
   vexation. Children, much talking does not do away with sin; and, as I
   have often said before, Confessors have no power over sin. Commune with
   your own hearts, and there confess your sins; for external, without
   internal confession, is of little avail in those things which are not
   sins unto death; and it is a sign that he who thus confesses neglects
   that which is within. For, where truth is to be found within, events
   may even be so far forgotten, that it often becomes impossible to say
   anything very definite about them; and we shall be best helped by
   leaving all to God. I am now referring to daily sins; from sins unto
   death may God preserve us!

   Now, children, it is very necessary that we should thus practice
   self-examination; for man has many a little nook within, which covers
   up the ground of the heart, and is so overgrown, that it hides the
   truth from the man himself; so that, though he knows many other things,
   he does not really know himself. These sins surely resemble thirty or
   forty skins or hides, like those of an ox, which cover up the ground,
   lying one upon another, and so thick and hard that ye can neither
   confess them nor rid yourselves of them as ye imagine. What are these
   skins? They are all those things that thou hast in thyself, that thou
   thinkest of, and that thou usest, but of which God is neither the true
   beginning nor the end. They are all idols, images of things, such as
   self-will, self-pleasing, and the enjoyment of things pertaining to the
   senses. Man clings to these, as Rachel did to her idols when she sat
   upon them. Presumption, heedlessness, want of resignation in divine
   things, all these sins help to form the skins. They should not be all
   confessed outwardly, but man should examine his own heart about them,
   and acknowledge them humbly before God, meekly falling down in
   self-abasement at His Feet. If man will only thus fully acknowledge
   that he is guilty, all will be well with him; that is, if he seeks
   diligently to turn away from them, as far as he is able, with help of
   Almighty God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  INSTRUCTION II

   The Second Instruction gives a short Form for the common Confession of
   Monks or Nuns, and shows how they may be absolved.

   Now we may generally confess our daily sins in these words:

   "I am guilty, for I have sinned by foolish thoughts during the seven
   Hours and in my prayers, when I ought to have occupied myself with good
   thoughts, but which have been spoilt by my indolence. I have broken the
   silence with useless words, at times and in places where talking is
   forbidden. I am guilty of scornful, hasty, unwise words and deeds, of
   untrue and unkind words, of indolence towards myself and towards God,
   my Order, my Choir, my Rules, and of disobedience and unthankfulness. I
   do not love and praise God as I ought; I do not attend to His warnings;
   I do not set my Brother a good example as I ought, in poverty, chastity
   and obedience. I have not kept all the vows I made to God and to my
   Order. Of these and many other things I confess I am guilty."

   Then ye may ask for absolution, and may think and say:

   "Dear Lord, if I could do it and were free, I would seek for
   absolution, and fetch it, even through frost and snow, through cold and
   wet. Dear Lord, because I can do nothing more, I beseech thee to give
   me absolution as thy gift of charity, and to make me a partaker in all
   the good exercises that have taken place in the House of God, and in
   all the earth; and that Thou wilt absolve me from all my sins, through
   thy Divine and Sacred Wounds, whence all grace flows."

   This thou mayest ask for in firm and strong faith and trust in God; and
   this will be such a blessing to thee that hereafter thou wilt be able
   to judge all the world. May we all thus learn to know God, and
   diligently search out our own hearts by the help of God. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  INSTRUCTION III

   The third Instruction shows man how he must take as his Example, the
   peculiar Attributes and Names assigned to God, and to His Divine Being;
   and how, on the other hand, he must bear his own nothingness, and then
   contemplate the unknown wastes and deserts of the Divine Attributes in
   quiet seclusion.

   Because God is a Pure Being and a Waste of calm seclusion, as Moses
   said: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is One Lord," yea One God, even
   One God Only, still, some of the special Attributes and divers Names
   that we assign to Him may serve as an example to us, while we compare
   our nothingness with Him. For, as I have often said, man is apt to
   think of all things in an earthly way, of our dear Lord's Birth, His
   Life, His Works and Ways. Therefore we must lift up our minds, and
   learn to soar far above time, in the Eternal Works of the Divine Being.
   Now man may reflect on these attributes in his mind in a very real way,
   so that he will be able to see that God is a Pure Being, that all
   beings are one, and yet that He is none of all these things. In all
   things that exist, in all that is and has any being, there is God. St
   Augustine says: "If thou seest a good man, a good Angel, a good Heaven,
   take away the man, take away the Angel, and take away the Heaven, and
   then that which remains is the Essence of Goodness, that is God; for He
   is in all things and yet far above all things." All creatures, indeed,
   have some goodness and love; but they are neither goodness nor love,
   but God only is the Essence of Goodness, of Love and of all that can be
   named. Man must compare himself with God, and then sink down with all
   his powers, with an intense and earnest gaze, that he may receive and
   renew his own nothingness, and be united with the Divine Being, Who
   only is the Life, the Soul and the Essence of all things.

   Man must consider the attributes of this Oneness of being; for God is
   the End of all unity, and in Him all diversities are united, and become
   one in the One Only Being. His Being is His work, His knowledge, His
   love, His reward, His mercy and His righteousness, all are one;
   therefore go, and carry thereto all thy diversities which are so great
   and so incomprehensible, that all may be made one in the Oneness of His
   Being.

   Man should also consider God as one who hides Himself; for He is known
   in all things, as Isaiah saith: "Verily, thou art a hidden God." He is
   much nearer than anything is to itself in the depths of the heart,
   hidden from all our senses and unknown in that heart, into which He
   forces all thy outward thoughts, which are as far from themselves and
   from thy inner life, as a beast which lives according to its nature,
   neither knowing, tasting or experiencing anything. Hide thyself in this
   secret place from all creatures, and from all that is strange to and
   unlike that Being. This must not be done in a figurative or imaginary
   way, but in very deed, with all our strength and desire, in a way which
   we cannot understand with our natural senses.

   Then man must look upon the desire of the Divine attributes in a quiet
   solitude, where no word is really spoken. All there is so still and
   mysterious and so desolate; for there is nothing there but God only,
   and nothing strange. Neither creature, nor image, nor fancy has ever
   entered there. This Wilderness was referred to by our Lord, when He
   spake by the prophet Joel (Hosea): "I will allure her and lead her into
   the Wilderness, and I will speak to her heart." This Wilderness is the
   quiet Desert of the Godhead, into which He leads all who are to receive
   this inspiration of God, now or in eternity. Bear thy foolish and
   barren heart into the Wilderness of the calm and living Godhead, thy
   heart which is so full of overgrown weeds, bare of all things good, and
   full of the wild beasts of thy animal nature. Then look upon the Divine
   Darkness, which is dark from its surpassing brightness to the
   comprehension of men and of Angels, as the shining of the sun on his
   course is as darkness to weak eyes. For all created minds compared with
   the brightness of nature are like the eyes of nightingales or swallows,
   in the bright sunlight. Men must cast down their eyes in their
   ignorance and blindness, because they are created beings. Bear thereto
   thine own deep darkness, robbed of all true light, and let the Abyss of
   the Divine Darkness only be acknowledged, while all other things remain
   unknown. The Abyss, which is unknown and has no name, is Salvation; and
   it is more beloved and entices more souls than all that they can know
   of Eternal Salvation in the Divine Being. May God bring us all to this
   Salvation! Amen.
