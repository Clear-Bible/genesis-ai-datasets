INTRODUCTION.

   PRACTICAL Discourses on Regeneration are among the most vital wants of
   this age. Although for the last century much has been written on this
   great doctrine, nothing has fallen under our observation so popular, so
   plain, so scriptural, and so practical, as the following production of
   Dr. Doddridge.

   These Discourses were prepared with great care by their excellent
   author, and delivered on Sabbath evenings to his own flock at
   Northampton; which embraced, let it be remembered, about forty young
   men, of his Academy, most of them candidates for the Christian
   Ministry. They attracted the attention of members of other
   congregations--"a great many such persons of different persuasions and
   communions making up a part of the auditory." They were attended with
   uncommon diligence to the last, and long before the series was
   finished, were earnestly requested for publication. The request grew
   more importunate at the close. Strangers from a distance joined in it,
   including several ministers--believing that what had proved so
   beneficial in the hearing, would be no less so in the reading, both at
   home and abroad. "I thought myself bound in duty," says Dr. Doddridge,
   "at length to comply; which I was the rather encouraged to do from the
   several instances in which I had reason to believe the Divine blessing
   had in some measure attended these sermons from the pulpit, and had
   made them the means of producing and advancing the change they
   described and enforced."

   This was in 1741. It was the period of the "Great Awakening" under the
   labors of Whitefield, Edwards, and others in this country, the effects
   of which were felt so powerfully at the time, in breaking up old
   systems of formalism, and inveterate habits of ungodliness; and which,
   with all its incidental excesses and evils, has been the main
   instrument in moulding the evangelical religion of this land, to this
   day. The impulse then given, the ideas then set forth, with the
   demonstration and power of the Spirit of God, are yet at work among us
   for good. It is well known that Drs. Watts and Doddridge shared in this
   impulse with a vital sympathy. They were in communication with Edwards
   for years. Northampton in old England and Northampton in New England,
   were centres of kindred ideas and feelings.

   And what was the Great Doctrine, which above all others was made
   prominent in the preaching of that time of God's power? What was that
   fundamental and fruitful Truth, which, before unknown, or inoperative
   because misunderstood, or neglected, now shook society to its centre,
   and cleared away old and worthless foundations, in order to rear anew
   the Spiritual Temple of the Most High? What but this very Doctrine of
   Regeneration, to the discussion of which the following pages are so
   wisely and yet so warmly devoted.

   The same great Truth, which in the age of Christ and his Apostles swept
   away the false hopes of hereditary profession--"the children of the
   flesh, these are not the children of God"--became again the Ruling Idea
   of the Age of Revival. So testifies the historian of "The Great
   Awakening." Speaking of this period he says, "The history of religious
   opinions and practices shows, that the most important practical idea,
   which then received increased prominence and power, and has held its
   place ever since, was the idea of the New Birth." "This doctrine of the
   New Birth, as an ascertainable change, was not generally prevalent in
   any communion, when the revival commenced; it was urged as of
   fundamental importance by the leading promoters of the revival; it took
   strong hold of those whom the revival affected; it naturally led to
   such questions as the revival brought up, and caused to be discussed;
   its perversions grew into, or associated with such errors as the
   revival promoted; it was adapted to provoke such opposition, and in
   such quarters, as the revival provoked; and its caricatures would
   furnish such pictures of the revival as opposers drew." [1]

   When it is said above that the doctrine of the new birth was not
   generally prevalent in any communion before the beginning of the Great
   Revival, we must understand that while held as a part of an orthodox
   creed, it was not generally preached, and consistently applied. In some
   communions, as, for instance, in the Church of Rome and in the Church
   of England, the doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration prevailed. In New
   England the scheme of church membership, called the "Half-Way
   Covenant," had been generally adopted, with an effect almost equally
   fatal. Men of sounder views in Congregational and Presbyterian
   churches--to say nothing of the Lutheran, and Dutch and German
   Reformed--found their evangelical teaching on this point unpalatable to
   those who had been trained to believe that by baptism in infancy they
   were brought into covenant with God. These and similar causes had
   lulled conscience asleep as with stupefying opiates, and "the form of
   godliness" to a great extent had supplanted its "power."

   The scriptural doctrine of the New Birth struck at the root of all
   these forms of error. It was mighty through God. It became the leading
   idea of the age. "Ye must be born again," flashed from every pulpit,
   and penetrated every heart.

   This great idea must in like manner take possession of our age, or
   Formalism will return. It must breathe into our countrymen the breath
   of a new life, or we shall become like the dry bones in the Valley of
   Vision. It must be set forth in our pulpits with all possible
   scriptural plainness; guarded from all perversion, on the right hand
   and on the left; fortified at every point by the testimony of God; and
   pressed to its genuine and resistless applications. All this must be
   done before the Church of Christ can rise again in her original beauty
   and vigor, or spread to her predestined greatness and glory--as the joy
   of the whole earth.

DISCOURSE I.

  OF THE CHARACTER OF THE UNREGENERATE.

  Ephes. ii. 1, 2.

   And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
   wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,
   according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now
   worketh in the children of disobedience.

   AMONG all the various trusts which men can repose in each other, hardly
   any appears to be more solemn and tremendous, than the direction of
   their sacred time, and especially of those hours which they spend in
   the exercise of public devotion. These seasons take up so small a part
   of our lives, when compared with that which the labors and recreations
   of them demand; and so much depends upon their being managed aright,
   that we, who are called to assist you in the employment and improvement
   of them, can hardly be too solicitous, that we discharge the trust, in
   a manner which we may answer to God and to you.

   If this thought dwell upon the mind with due weight, it will have some
   sensible influence upon our discourses to you, as well as on the strain
   of those addresses which we present to the Throne of Grace in your
   name, and on your account. We shall not be over-anxious about the order
   of words, the elegance of expression, or the little graces of
   composition or delivery; but shall study to speak on the most important
   subjects, and to handle them with such gravity and seriousness, with
   such solemnity and spirit, as may, through the Divine blessing, be most
   likely to penetrate the hearts of our hearers; to awaken those that are
   entirely unconcerned about religion, and to animate and assist those,
   who, being already acquainted with it, desire to make continual
   advances--which will be the case of every truly good man.

   It is my earnest prayer for myself, and for my brethren in the ministry
   of all denominations, that we may, in this respect, approve our wisdom
   and integrity to God, and commend ourselves to the consciences of all
   men. 2 Cor. iv. 9. It is our charge, as we shall answer it another day
   to the God of the spirits of all flesh, to use our prudent and zealous
   endeavors, to make men truly wise and good, virtuous and happy: but to
   this purpose, it is by no means sufficient to content ourselves, merely
   with attempting to reform the immoralities and irregularities of their
   lives, and to bring them to an external behavior, decent, honorable,
   and useful. An undertaking like this, while the inward temper is
   neglected, even when it may seem most effectual, will be but like
   painting the face of one who is ready to die, or laboring to repair a
   ruinous house, by plastering and adorning its walls, while its
   foundations are decayed. There is an awful passage in Ezekiel to this
   purpose, which I hope we shall often recollect; (Ezek. xiii. 10-14;)
   "Wo to the foolish prophets--because they have seduced my people,
   saying Peace, when there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and lo,
   others daubed it with untempered mortar: say unto them that daub it
   with untempered mortar, that it shall fall:--Thus saith the Lord God, I
   will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury: and there shall be an
   overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to
   consume it: so will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
   untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the
   foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall
   be consumed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am the
   Lord."

   If there be any, in one body of Christians or another, that abet men's
   natural disposition to flatter themselves in a way that is not good, by
   encouraging them to hope for salvation, because they were baptized in
   their infancy; because they have diligently attended on public worship,
   or merely because they do nobody any harm, but are rather kind and
   helpful to others; or because their faith is orthodox, their transports
   of affection warm, or their assurance confident; I pray God to awaken
   them by the power of his grace, before they are consumed, with their
   hearers, in the ruins of their deceitful-building.

   Those of you who are my stated hearers can witness for me, that in this
   respect I have delivered my own soul. Ezek. xxxiii. 9. It has been the
   steady tenor of my doctrine among you, that our hope and confidence
   must be in Christ, and not in ourselves; and that, if we desire to be
   interested in the righteousness he has wrought out, and in the
   blessings he has purchased by his sacred blood, we must be
   experimentally acquainted with the work of God's renewing grace upon
   our souls, curing the inward distempers of our degenerate hearts, and
   transforming us into the image of his holiness. That is what we are
   taught in Scripture to call by the name of Regeneration; and
   considering how much the subject is neglected by some, and I fear I may
   add, misrepresented and disguised by others, I apprehend I shall
   profitably employ an evening hour for several succeeding Sabbaths, in
   giving a larger account than I have yet done, of the scripture doctrine
   on this important subject and its various parts.

   It shall be my care, in the series of these discourses, as God shall
   enable me, to speak the words of truth and soberness; (Acts xxvi. 27;)
   and I entreat you to have recourse to the law and to the testimony,
   (Isa. viii. 20,) that ye may judge of the truth and weight of what I
   say. I desire not to be regarded any farther, than I produce evidence
   from reason and scripture; but so far as we are disregarded while we
   have the concurrent testimony of both, our hearers must see to it; and
   their danger will then be proportionable to the importance of those
   truths, which their negligence, or their prejudice, engage them either
   to reject, or to overlook.

   The plan, on which I intend to proceed in the course of these lectures,
   is this: I will endeavor to describe the character of those whom we may
   properly call persons in an unregenerate state. I will describe the
   nature of that change, which may properly be called regeneration, or
   conversion. I will show at large the absolute necessity of this change,
   and the consequent misery of those that are strangers to it. I shall
   endeavor to prove the reality and necessity of the Divine influences on
   the mind, in the production of such a change. I shall describe some of
   those various methods, by which God is pleased to operate in the
   production of this holy and important work. I shall propose some advice
   to those who are already awakened, as to the method in which they are
   to seek renewing and converting grace. After which, I shall conclude
   these discourses with an address to those who have experienced this
   happy change, as to the manner in which they ought to be affected with
   such a series of sermons as this, and the improvement they should make
   of what they hear and what they have felt agreeable to it.

   I should be peculiarly inexcusable, if I entered upon such a subject,
   without earnest and importunate prayers to the Fountain of light,
   grace, and holiness, that while you hear of this important doctrine,
   you may have that experimental knowledge of it, without which such
   discourses will indeed seem obscure and enthusiastical, according to
   the degree in which they are rational and spiritual. I shall only add
   that these lectures will take their rise from a variety of texts, which
   I shall not, according to my usual method, largely open and dilate
   upon, but only touch on them as so many mottoes to the respective
   sermons to which they are prefixed.

   As I intend not philosophical essays, but plain, practical, and popular
   addresses, I shall begin,

   First, With describing the CHARACTER OF THOSE WHOM WE MAY PROPERLY CALL
   UNCONVERTED AND UNREGENERATE PERSONS. It is absolutely necessary that I
   should do this, that you may respectively know your own personal
   concern in what is further to be laid before you in the process of
   these lectures.

   Now you have the general character of such, in the words of my text;
   and a very sad one it is. They are represented, as dead in trespasses
   and sins, utterly indisposed both for the actions and enjoyments of the
   spiritual and divine life; as walking according to the course of this
   world, a sad intimation that it was the state of the generality of
   mankind; nay, according to the prince of the power of the air, that
   impure and wicked spirit, who works, or exerts his energy, in the
   children of disobedience, that is, in those who reject and despise the
   gospel; in which it is implied, and a dreadful implication it is, that
   the course and conduct of those, who reject the gospel, is according to
   the desire and instigation of the prince of darkness: they are going on
   as the devil himself would have them, and choose that path for
   themselves, which he chooses for them, as leading them to most certain
   and most aggravated ruin.

   And who are these unhappy persons? Surely there must be some of them
   among us: for who can flatter himself, that in so numerous an assembly,
   the course of all is different from that of the world: and that all
   have happily triumphed over the artifices of that accursed spirit, who
   is, by God's righteous permission, become its prince, while it
   continues in its apostate state? I shall however think it a very happy
   point gained, if I could convince any of you, who are justly liable to
   that conviction, that you are the men; if I could, as it were, render
   visible to your eyes those subtile, yet strongly complicated chains, in
   which Satan is binding you, and by which he is drawing you on to
   eternal ruin; that you might recover yourselves out of the snare of the
   devil, who are led captive by him at his will.

   I am now to describe the character of unregenerate men; but I cannot
   pretend to do it in all the variety of circumstances which may attend
   it. I shall therefore mention only some particulars which are most
   important, and which most certainly demonstrate a person to be of that
   wretched number. There are a great variety of countenances in the human
   species; yet the principal features in all are the same, though their
   proportion and lineaments may differ: and I apprehend, the characters
   which I am now to lay down, will most of them suit every unregenerate
   person, though they may appear in various persons in different degrees
   and different instances. I shall chiefly lay down these characters in
   negatives, as I apprehend it is the safest way: and would only observe,
   what you may easily imagine, that I speak only of the adult; for I
   would cautiously avoid entangling this Discourse with what relates
   purely to the case of infants, lest Satan should get an advantage over
   us, and turn that into an occasion to amuse curiosity, which I humbly
   hope, under the influence of the Spirit of God, will be a means of
   awakening conviction, and of breaking that delusive peace, in which,
   like the strong man armed, he keeps his vassals, till the fatal hour
   come which is to complete their ruin.

   To waive the formality of labored demonstrations in a case which admits
   of such easy evidence, I shall go upon this obvious principle in the
   whole of my reasoning: That to be regenerate, and to be born of God,
   are in scripture terms of the same import; and consequently, that
   whatever temper and disposition is in scripture declared to be
   inconsistent with the character of a child of God, must necessarily
   denominate a man an unregenerate person. And one would think this
   principle could hardly be disputed, since all that allow of
   regeneration at all, in a Christian sense, seem to understand by it,
   that change, whatever it is, by which a person is made a child of God,
   and by consequence an heir of heaven.

   Now on this principle, you may take the marks of an unregenerate person
   in such particulars as these; and let those, whose conscience owns
   them, hear and tremble.

   1. The soul that never seriously inquired into its spiritual state, is,
   beyond all doubt, an unregenerate soul.

   The Apostle earnestly presses it upon the Christians to whom he wrote,
   that they should diligently examine themselves whether they were in the
   faith; (2 Cor. xiii. 5;) and he who has entirely neglected to do it,
   seems to express, not merely a forgetfulness of religion, but even a
   contempt of it too. Nevertheless, be it known unto you, Sirs, that an
   humble return to God, and a cordial dedication of soul to his service,
   is not so slight an act of a man's life, that it should pass without
   any observation in doing it, or any serious reflection on having done
   it. Religion is a deliberate thing; it brings a man seriously to
   consider his ways, that he may turn his feet to God's commandments;
   (Psal. cxix. 59;) to search and try them, that he may turn again unto
   the Lord. Lam. iii. 40. A good man is so impressed with the thoughts of
   God, and of eternity, that perhaps he is rather ready to be over
   anxiously afraid and suspicious, in a matter of so great importance:
   and therefore will review on the one hand, the plan of salvation that
   God has laid down in his word, and on the other, the correspondency to
   it that he may discover in his own soul; and if there are any of you
   that have never been thus employed, any that have never separated
   yourselves awhile from other employments, that you might seek and
   intermeddle with this Divine wisdom, (Prov. xviii. 1,) you are
   assuredly strangers to it. If there are any of you that have never
   studied God's word, to learn his will from thence; that have never
   attended to sermons, that you might try yourselves by them, and, if
   possible, carry home something of the chief of what you hear, to assist
   your retired, and more diligent inquiries; you may now come to a very
   quick conclusion, and before you leave this place, yea, before I
   proceed to any further particulars, you may set it down as the
   memorable beginning of these lectures, and of this discourse, "I am
   already proved to be an unregenerate creature: I am in the gall of
   bitterness and in the bond of iniquity." Acts viii. 23. Nay, you may
   add, that there are perhaps thousands of those that are unregenerate
   sinners, who have not been so careless and so insensible as you. For,
   indeed, Sirs, a man may begin an examination, and start back from the
   prosecution of it, before it is brought to any important issue; or
   trying himself by false characters, he may come to a conclusion, which
   will be so much the more dangerous, as it has been the more deliberate.
   For the sake of such therefore, I add,

   2. The soul that is not deeply convinced of its guilt before God, and
   desirous to seek deliverance from it by the Lord Jesus Christ, is still
   in an unregenerate state.

   All the promises of God's paternal favor do certainly imply the promise
   of forgiveness; and you well know, that these are appropriated to such
   as humble themselves before God: and that humbling which is merely
   external, and implies no deep sense of inward guilt can pass for very
   little with that God, who searches the heart, and tries the reins of
   the children of men. Jer. xvii. 10.

   The Scripture assures us, that whosoever believes that Jesus is the
   Christ, is born of God; (1 John v. 1;) and nothing can be more certain
   from the whole tenor of it, than that he that believes not, shall be
   damned, (Mark xvi. 16,) and surely a state of damnation is not, and
   cannot be, a state of regeneration. But what is this faith in Christ?
   Is it no more than a bare notional persuasion, that he is the Son of
   God? If this were all, the devils themselves believe; (Jam. ii. 19;)
   and many were the instances, in which you know that they confessed it,
   and trembled before him. You cannot then be ignorant, that the faith,
   to which the promises of salvation are made, is a faith, which receives
   the Lord Jesus Christ in all his offices; which trusts his atonement,
   as well as admits his revelation; and flies to him for righteousness
   and life. And how can that man seek righteousness from Christ, who is
   insensible to his own guilt? or how can he depend on him for life, who
   is not aware that he is under a sentence of death and condemnation?

   But imagine not you are secure, because you acknowledge yourselves to
   be sinners. If that acknowledgment be slight and formal, it shows you
   are strangers to the operation of that Spirit, whose office it is to
   convince men of sin. John xvi. 8. If you have not been made sensible of
   the pollution of your hearts as well as the rebellion of your lives; if
   you have not received as it were a sentence of death in yourselves, and
   submitted to that sentence as righteous, though ever so dreadful; if
   you have not been made to loathe and abhor yourselves, and to repent in
   dust and ashes; (Job xliii. 5;) if you have not laid your hand on your
   mouth, (Mich. vii. 16,) and your mouth in the dust, (Lam. iii. 29,)
   crying out, Unclean, unclean, (Lev. xiii. 46,) and in this sense at
   least, adopted that pathetic complaint, O wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me? (Rom. vii. 24,) it is a certain sign, that sin still
   reigns in your mortal bodies, (Rom. vi. 12,) and is unto this day
   bringing forth fruit unto death. Rom. vii. 5.

   3. The soul that is unconcerned about the favor of God, and communion
   with him, is still in an unregenerate state.

   Common reason may tell you, that a soul destitute of the love of God,
   can never be the object of his complacential regards; and that it is
   impossible you should love him, while you are unconcerned about his
   favor, and habitually indifferent to converse with him. You believe
   there is a God; you acknowledge that he is the great benefactor of the
   whole world; you know your happiness depends upon his favor; you wish
   therefore that you may enjoy it; that is, you wish that some way or
   other you may be happy, rather than miserable. But let conscience say,
   whether you have ever felt, that in his favor is life; (Psal. xxx. 5;)
   whether you have ever known what it is to cry out with intenseness and
   ardor of soul, Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon me. Psal.
   iv. 6. Alas, Sirs, had you been sons, God would have sent the Spirit of
   his Son into your hearts; (Gal. iv. 6;) and if this be not the sincere,
   if it be not the habitual language of your soul; if you do not thus
   earnestly desire to live under the manifestations of the divine love,
   and to be able to say, truly our communion is with the Father, and with
   his Son Jesus Christ; (1 John i. 3;) you are spiritually dead, and
   under the fatal influences of that carnal mind, which, being enmity
   against God, (Rom. viii. 7,) engages men to live contented without God
   in the world, (Eph. ii. 12,) so long as their corn and their wine
   increase. Psal. iv. 7. A heart, thus alienated from God, was never
   savingly turned to him, and can have no just reason to imagine itself
   the object of his paternal favor.

   4. The soul that is destitute of a sincere love to mankind, has reason
   to consider itself as in an unregenerate state.

   You may, perhaps, think it unnecessary to mention this; but the Apostle
   was undoubtedly a much better judge, and his own words suggest this
   particular to me: Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God;
   and every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God; he that
   loveth not, knoweth not God, and consequently cannot be born of him;
   for God is love. 1 John iv. 7, 8. And our Lord strongly intimates the
   same thought, when he exhorts his disciples to the most universal and
   unlimited benevolence by this argument, that ye may be the children of
   your Father which is in heaven; (Matt. v. 45;) plainly implying, that
   otherwise they could not really be born of God, or claim him for their
   Father. Regeneration is to form a man for intimate communion with the
   general assembly and church of the first born, (Heb. xii. 23,) and to
   prepare him for the region of complete and everlasting love; and the
   first fruits of it are to appear, and to be manifested here. It is a
   faithful saying, that they who believe in God should be careful to
   maintain good works; (Tit. iii. 8;) and unfeigned love is to be the
   root of them; so that if you cannot stand this trial, your religious
   hopes are all delusive and vain.

   Let me entreat you therefore, that you would now look into your lives
   and hearts. Do any of the malignant passions harbor there? Ask
   yourselves, "Is there any of my fellow-creatures, whom I wish to see
   miserable; or would make so, if it were in my power to do it by the
   secret act of my will, so that no mortal on earth should ever know me
   to be the cause of the calamity?" If it be so, and this be your settled
   temper, you hate your brethren and are murderers; (1 John iii. 15;) and
   therefore are the children of the devil, who was a murderer from the
   beginning; and we may thus say of you in the very words of our Lord,
   who never uttered a rash censure: You are of your father the devil, for
   his passions you cherish, and his lust you would do. John viii. 44.

   But reflect farther, If you wish others no harm, do you really wish
   them well? and that so really, and so sincerely, as to be ready to do
   them good? For merely to say unto them, depart in peace, be warmed and
   filled, (Jam. ii. 16,) when you have it in your power to help them, is
   at once to mock the poor, and to despise him that made him. Prov. xvii.
   5. You that are conscious of a mean selfish temper, and wrap yourselves
   up, as it were, in your own separate interests, or in those of your own
   families, and can feel a concern for no others; you that devise what
   you may imagine shrewd and prudent things, but none that are liberal
   and compassionate; you whose eye does not affect your heart, when you
   see the distresses of your brethren, while you have this world's good,
   how dwelleth the love of God in you? 1 John iii. 17. How can you
   imagine you are the children of him, whom you so little resemble?

   Nay, permit me to add once more upon this, that if all your compassion
   is only moved by men's temporal calamities, and works not in any degree
   with respect to their spiritual and eternal interests, you have reason
   to fear, that it is no better than an unsanctified humanity; and
   indeed, that you never have learnt the worth of your own souls, while
   you set so little value on the souls of others, even of those, to whom
   you profess and intend friendship. And this concluding hint is of
   importance to prevent a dangerous mistake, in which too many good
   natured sinners are ready to flatter themselves, and in which, perhaps,
   others are too ready to join in flattering them.

   5. He that does not know what it is, to struggle with indwelling sin,
   and heartily to resolve against indulging it in any kind or degree, is
   undoubtedly still in an unregenerate state.

   You will observe, I do not say, that every one who knows what it is, to
   feel a struggle in his own mind, when assaulted by temptations to sin,
   is a truly good man: the contrary is dreadfully apparent. A principle
   of natural conscience often makes very strong remonstrances against
   sin, and sends out bitter cries when subjected to its violence; and
   this is so far from denominating a, man a real Christian, that it
   rather illustrates the power of sin, and aggravates its guilt. But when
   a man's inclinations run entirely one way, and when he gives a swing to
   his natural passions without any guard or restraint; when he is a
   stranger to any inward conflict with himself, and any victory over his
   own lusts, and his corrupted will; it is a certain sign, he is yet
   under the dominion of Satan, and is to be numbered among the tamest of
   his slaves. For they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with
   the affections and lusts; (Gal. v. 24;) have learnt to deny themselves,
   (Matt. xvi. 24,) and to mortify their members upon the earth. Col. iii.
   5.

   It is also of great importance to add, that there must be a resolution
   to oppose sin in every kind, and in every degree; for he that is born
   of God sinneth not; (1 John v. 18;) nay, it is elsewhere said, He
   cannot commit sin; (1 John iii. 9;) and though it is too visibly true
   in fact, and apparent from several other passages in the very Epistle
   whence these words are taken, that this expression is to be interpreted
   with some limitation; yet the least that it can be imagined to signify
   is this, that he does not wilfully allow himself in the practice of any
   sin. He has learnt to hate every false way, and to esteem all God's
   precepts, concerning all things to be right; (Psal. cxix. 128;) so that
   upon the whole, if he might have his request, and God would grant him
   the thing that he longs for, (Job vi. 3,) it would be this, to sin no
   more, and get rid of every sentiment, desire, and affection, in any
   degree contrary to the purity of God's nature and law. If, therefore,
   there be any of you, that spare one accursed thing, though you should
   seem eager on destroying all the rest--if it be the secret language of
   your soul, "There is but one lust that I will indulge; there is but one
   temptation that I will comply with;" I perceive your hearts are not
   right in the sight of God; (Acts viii. 21;) for though you could
   according to your pretended purpose, keep all the rest of the law, and
   yet offend in this one point alone, you would, in effect, be a
   transgressor of all. Jam. ii. 10. In short, He that commitetth sin is
   of the devil; (1 John iii. 8;) but he that is begotten of God, keepeth
   himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 1 John v. 18.

   6. He that does not know what it is, to overcome this world, and to
   place his happiness in another, is yet in an unregenerate state.

   This is another of those certain marks, which God has given us of his
   own children. Whatsoever is born of God--as it is very emphatically
   expressed in the original--overcometh the world. 1 John v. 4. (pan to`
   gegenneme'non ek tou Theou.) It is not, you see, the extraordinary
   attainment of a few more eminent Christians; but it is an essential
   branch of every good man's character; for he is begotten again unto a
   lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, even to
   the hope of an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
   fadeth not away. 1 Pet. i. 3, 4.

   You have reason, therefore, to judge very sadly concerning your state,
   if you are strangers to this lively hope; which is a very different
   thing from that hope to be saved, of which some people talk in so
   indolent, not to say in so profane a manner, as to show, that it is the
   hope of the hypocrite, which will perish, when God takes away his soul.
   Job viii. 13; xxvii. 3. If you are conscious to yourselves, that you
   mind earthly things, your end will be destruction, (Phil. iii. 19,) for
   having your heart on earth, it is plain your only treasure is here;
   (Matt. vi. 21;) and if you govern yourselves by worldly maxims alone,
   and your great care be to obtain those riches and honors, which the
   children of the world pursue; if the importance of eternity has never
   appeared in such a light, as to make you judge everything trifling that
   can come in competition with it; nay, whatever your views of eternity
   have been, if you are not practically carrying on a scheme for it: and
   if you cannot, and do not, deny your worldly interest, when it cannot
   be secured without hazarding your eternal hopes; it is plain you are
   friends of the world, in such a sense as none can be, but he must be an
   enemy of God. Jam. iv. 4. If indeed you were dead to the world, and
   your life hid with Christ in God, you would set your affections on
   things above, on those things which are there where Christ sitteth on
   the right hand of God; (Col. iii. 1, 2, 3;) but the want of this temper
   shows that you are carnally minded, which it is death to be; (Rom.
   viii. 6;) and that the redeeming love of Christ has never exerted its
   influence upon your souls, nor his cross had any due efficacy upon you;
   for if it had, the world would have been crucified to you, and you to
   the world. Gal. vi. 14.

   7. The soul that does not long for greater improvements in the divine
   life, is still a stranger to the first principles of it.

   You know, that we are called, as Christians, with an high and holy
   calling; (Phil. iii. 14; 2 Tim. i. 9;) and as he that is the author of
   this calling is holy, so are we to be holy in all manner of
   conversation, (1 Pet. i. 15,) and to be perfect, even as our Father
   which is in heaven is perfect. Matt. v. 48. Here will therefore be room
   for improvement, not only during our continuance in the present life,
   but through all the ages of a glorious eternity; and it is the ardent
   desire of every good man, that in this sense above all others, his path
   may be like the shining light, that shineth more and more, until the
   perfect day. Prov. iv. 18. And this is the one thing that he does, or
   that in which all his labors centre; being conscious to himself how far
   he is from having already attained, or being already perfect,
   forgetting the things that are behind, he reacheth forth unto those
   things that are before, and presses toward the mark, for the prize of
   the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Phil. iii. 12-14. In this view
   he seriously considers the circumstances of life in which Providence
   has placed him; that he may observe the advantages, which these
   circumstances give him for religious improvements; and it is delightful
   to him to discover such advantages.

   Now if there be any of you, who know nothing of this temper, you are
   certainly in an unregenerate state; for none can be born of God, that
   do not love him; and none can truly love him, that do not earnestly
   desire, more and more to resemble him. So that if your hearts can
   indulge such a thought as this, "I wish I knew how much religion would
   be just sufficient to save me, and r would go so far, and stop there;"
   your conscience must tell you that you secretly hate religion, and are
   unwillingly dragged towards the form of it, by an unnatural and
   external violence--the fear of misery and ruin in neglecting it; and
   that you are not actuated by the free and liberal principle of a nature
   savingly renewed.

   8. The soul that does not know what it is, to live by faith in Christ,
   and in dependence on his Spirit, is still in an unregenerate state.

   We are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus, (Gal. iii.
   26,) if indeed we are so at all; and he that is joined to the Lord, in
   this sense, is one spirit with him. 1 Cor. vi. 17. But if any man have
   not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, (Rom. viii. 9,) for as God
   has predestined us to the adoption of children, by Jesus Christ, to
   himself, (Ephes. i. 5,) so of his fullness it is, that all believers do
   receive, even grace for grace, (John i. 16,) or an abundance and
   variety of grace, by virtue of their union with him, who is the head:
   from whom the whole body being fitly joined together and strengthened
   by what every joint supplies, by an energy proportionable to every
   part, increases to the edifying of itself in love. Eph. iv. 15, 18.

   These things, as you see, are not only hinted in Scripture, but are
   copiously insisted upon, as very material points; and though I readily
   acknowledge, good men may apprehend and consider them very differently,
   and may express those apprehensions in different phrases; yet as
   experience makes it plain, that those souls generally flourish most,
   who have the most distinct conceptions of them, and the most habitual
   regard to them; so I think it is plain from these Scriptures, that
   there can be no religion at all, where there is a total insensibility
   of them.

   If, therefore there are any of you, that apprehend it is enthusiasm to
   talk of the assistances of the Spirit; nay, I will add, if there are
   any of you, that do not earnestly desire these assistances, and do not
   seek them daily from the hand of Christ as the great covenant head of
   his people, you are, I fear, strangers to some of the first principles
   of the oracles of God, (Heb. v. 12,) and are sensual, not having the
   Spirit. Jude, verse 9. And though you may now and then form a hasty,
   and perhaps a warm resolution in religion, you will quickly, with the
   proud youth that are conceited of their own sufficiency, faint and be
   weary, and with the young men you will utterly fail; while they only
   that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength, shall mount up as
   on eagles' wings, and, pressing on with an unwearied pace, according to
   the different degrees of vigor which the different parts of their
   course may require, shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not
   faint. Isa. xl. 30, 31. In short, if you do not thirst after the water
   of life, that is, (as the Evangelist himself explains it,) the spirit,
   which they that believe on Christ shall receive, (John vii. 39,)
   however bountiful he is, he makes no promise to impart it to you; and
   if you never receive it, all your other sources of comfort will soon be
   dried up, and the miserable condition of the creature, that asked in
   vain for one drop of water to cool his tormented tongue, (Luke xvi.
   24,) will certainly be yours.

   Here I apprehend multitudes will miscarry, who have made a fair show in
   the eyes of men; and if you are condemned by this mark, I am sure you
   will not be acquitted by any of the preceding. For all the branches of
   a holy temper have such connection with this, and such a dependence
   upon it, that a man, who is destitute of this, can have only the
   semblance of the rest.

   And thus, I have with all plainness and faithfulness, as in the sight
   of God, and sensible of my account to him, laid before you a variety of
   hints, by which I think you may safely and truly judge, whether you be,
   or be not, in an unregenerate state: and I shall now beg leave to
   conclude this Discourse with one plain inference from the whole, viz:

   That BAPTISM IS NOT REGENERATION, in the scriptural and most important
   sense of the word.

   To prove this as a corollary from the preceding Discourse, I shall only
   assume this most reasonable concession, with which you may remember I
   at first set out: that regeneration, and being born of God, signify the
   same thing. Now I have shown you from a variety of scriptures, under
   the former heads, that every one whom the Sacred Oracles represent as
   born of God receiveth Christ, overcometh the world, and sinneth not.
   But it is too plain, that these characters do not agree to every one
   that is baptized: and consequently it evidently follows, that every one
   who is baptized is not of course born of God, or regenerate; therefore,
   that baptism is not scriptural regeneration.

   I think no mathematical demonstration plainer, and more certain than
   this conclusion; and therefore, whatever great and ancient names may be
   urged on the other side of the question, I shall rest the matter here,
   without leading you into the niceties of a controversy so easily
   decided. [2] I would only further observe, that they who most
   vigorously contend for the other manner of speaking, (for after all it
   is but a dispute about a word,) acknowledge expressly, that a man may
   be saved without what they call regeneration, and that he may perish
   with it. And though persons are taught to speak of their state, in
   consequence of baptism, in very high, and, I fear, dangerous terms; yet
   when wise and good men come to explain those terms, it evidently
   appears, that many of whom they are used, are so in a state of
   salvation as to be daily obnoxious to damnation! so the children of
   God, as also to be the children of the devil! and so inheritors of the
   kingdom of heaven, as to be children of wrath, and on the brink of
   hell!

   Where persons of real piety apprehend themselves under a necessity of
   using such phrases with respect to all that are baptized, we cannot
   blame them for endeavoring to bring down their signification as low as
   possible; but they will, I hope, excuse those who choose to speak, in
   what they apprehend to be a more scriptural, rational, and edifying
   language.

   It was matter of conscience with me, to state the matter as you have
   heard. I do therefore earnestly entreat you, my dearly beloved, in the
   name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and for the sake of your own immortal
   souls, that you deceive not yourselves with vain words; but that where
   your eternal salvation is so plainly concerned, you bring the cause,
   the important cause, to an immediate trial. And if you are convinced,
   as I suppose many of you quickly may be, that you are at present dead
   in trespasses and sins, then let me beseech you to reflect on what the
   most transient survey of the Scriptures may teach you, as to the danger
   of such a case. For though it will be my business, in the process of
   these Discourses, more largely to represent it, when I come to speak of
   the necessity of the new birth, God only knows, whether your lives may
   be continued, till we advance so far in the subject: and where a case
   of this kind is in question, the delay of a week, or even of a day, may
   be inevitable and eternal ruin.

DISCOURSE II.

  OF THE NATURE OF REGENERATION, AND PARTICULARLY OF THE CHANGE IT PRODUCES IN
  MEN'S APPREHENSIONS.

  2 COR. v. 17.

   If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed
   away, behold all things are become new.

   THE knowledge of our true state in religion, is at once a matter of so
   great importance, and so great difficulty that, in order to obtain it,
   it is necessary we should have line upon line and precept upon precept.
   The plain discourse, which you before heard, was intended to lead you
   into it; and I question not but I then said enough to convince many,
   that they were in an unregenerate condition. Nevertheless, as there are
   various approaches towards regeneration and conversion, which on the
   whole fall short of it; I think it very expedient now to give you, what
   I may properly enough call the counterpart of this view; which I shall,
   by Divine assistance, attempt from the words I have now been reading.

   The Apostle, who wrote them, was transported to such a zeal for Christ,
   and for the souls of men, that some thought him beside himself, (verse
   13,) and no doubt many would represent him as the greatest enthusiast
   upon the face of the earth. But as it was a very small thing to him to
   be judged of man's judgment, (1 Cor. iv. 3,) he calmly vindicates
   himself, by declaring that there was a cause for all this warmth, as
   the honor of God, and the Redeemer, and the eternal salvation of men,
   were so intimately concerned in the affair. The love of Christ, says
   he, constrains us, or, (as the word properly signifies,) it bears us
   away with it, like a mighty torrent, which we are not able to resist;
   because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead,
   under the sentence of God's righteous law--or they would not have
   needed such an atonement as the blood of his Son; and we farther judge,
   that he died for all, that they who now live, only in consequence of
   his dying love, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
   him that died for them. 2 Cor. v. 14, 15. We therefore live to this
   Jesus; we consecrate our lives and labors to this purpose; and in
   consequence of it, we henceforth know no man after the flesh, that is,
   we do not regard our temporal interests, nor consider how we may most
   effectually obtain the favor and friendship of those who may be useful
   to us in life; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, or
   have expected a temporal Messiah, who should make our nation triumphant
   over the Gentiles, and enrich it with the spoils of other nations, yet
   now henceforth we know him no more under such a character. Verse 16.
   And in this respect the same temper will prevail in the heart of every
   real Christian; and therefore, i. e. in consequence of what was said
   before of the Redeemer's love, if any man be in Christ, if he be really
   one of his faithful servants, united to him by a lively faith, and in
   consequence of that union interested in his salvation, he is a new
   creature: his views and sentiments, his affections and pursuits, are so
   entirely changed, that he seems, as it were, to be come into a new
   world, and to be transformed quite into another person from what he
   formerly was; old things are passed away, and, behold the astonishing
   transformation! all things are become new. This is the thought that I
   am now to illustrate; and you cannot but see, how proper a foundation
   it will be for our Discourse on,

   The second general head I proposed, which is, Particularly to describe
   the nature of that great change, which passes on every soul, that is
   truly regenerate, in the scriptural, and most important sense of the
   word. [3]

   And here it may hardly seem necessary to tell you, that I do not mean
   to assert, that the substance of the soul, and its natural faculties,
   are in a strict and proper sense changed; a man might as reasonably
   assert from such a Scripture, that the former body was annihilated, and
   a new one produced; and common sense and decency will not allow us to
   imagine, that the Apostle meant anything of this nature, by the general
   terms he uses here. But the plain meaning is, that when a man becomes a
   real Christian, the whole temper and character of his mind is so
   changed, as to become different from that of the generality of mankind,
   and different from what it formerly was, while in an unenlightened and
   unrenewed state. It is not merely a little circumstantial alteration;
   it is not assuming a new name, professing new speculative opinions, or
   practising some new rites and forms; but it is becoming, as we
   frequently say, in our usual forms of speech, a different creature or a
   new man.

   And thus the sacred writers express themselves in many other passages,
   which very happily serve to illustrate this. They, in particular,
   represent God as promising, with relation to this work; (Ezek. xxxvi.
   26;) a new heart will give them, and a new spirit will I put within
   them; and I will take away the heart of stone, that stubborn,
   obstinate, impenetrable disposition they once had, and will give them
   an heart of flesh, a tender, compliant temper, which shall incline them
   to submit to my will with humility, and to obey it with delight. And
   thus, when the apostle had exhorted the Ephesians, (Ephes. iv. 22-24,)
   to put off, with respect to their former conversation, the old man,
   which is corrupt according to its deceitful lusts, he adds, And be
   renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, which after
   God, or in conformity to his image, is created in righteousness and
   true holiness; which is further illustrated by his important
   exhortation to the Romans. Rom. xii. 2. Be not conformed to this world;
   but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. And on the same
   principles, what in one place he calls the new creature, (Gal. vi. 15,)
   in another parallel place he expresses, by faith that works by love,
   (Gal. v. 6,) and by keeping the commandments of God; (1 Cor. vii. 19;)
   for all these, as equivalent characters, he opposes to circumcision and
   uncircumcision, or the mere externals of a religious profession;
   declaring the utter insufficiency of the latter, and the absolute
   necessity of the former.

   The general nature of this change may then be understood by an
   attentive consideration of such Scriptures as those mentioned above:
   which indeed contain what is most essential on this subject. But for
   the more complete illustration of the matter, I shall particularly show
   you, that where there is reason to speak of a man, as one of those who
   are in Christ Jesus, or who are truly regenerate, there will be new
   apprehensions--new affections--new resolutions--new labors--new
   enjoyments--and new hopes.

   Perhaps there are few important branches of the Christian character,
   which may not be introduced as illustrating one or other of these
   remarks. The former of them is indeed the foundation of the rest;
   because, as religion is a reasonable service, all the change which is
   made in the affections and resolutions, in the pursuits, enjoyments,
   and hopes of a good man, arises from that different view, in which he
   is now taught to look on those objects, the nature of which is to
   direct his choice, to determine his conduct, and regulate his passions;
   it will therefore be the business of this Discourse to show you,

   I. That wherever there is a real principle of regeneration, there will
   be new apprehensions of things.

   When God created the natural world, he said, in the very beginning of
   his work, Let there be light, and there was light. Gen. i. 3. And thus
   he deals in this new creation, which raises the soul from a chaos, to
   such a beautiful, well-ordered, and well-furnished frame. God, says the
   Apostle, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
   into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of
   God, in the face of Jesus Christ; (2 Cor. iv. 6;) whereas before, the
   understanding was darkened, being alienated from the life of God,
   through the ignorance that was in them, because of the blindness or
   perverseness of their hearts. Ephes. iv. 18.

   Now this illumination, of which I am speaking, does not so much refer
   to a speculative, as to a practical and heart-impressing knowledge. It
   is true, that when a man once comes to be in good earnest in religion,
   he generally arrives at a clearer and fuller knowledge, even of the
   doctrines of Christianity, than he had before: for he then sets himself
   to inquire with greater diligence, and to seek light of the great
   Father of Lights with greater earnestness; he gets clear of many evil
   affections, that put a corrupt bias upon his judgment; and he comes
   within the reach of those promises, Then shall we know, if we follow on
   to know the Lord; (Hos. vi. 3;) and if any man will do his will, he
   shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God. John vii. 17.

   Yet, I think, I may very properly say, that at various times, when our
   judgment of any object is the same, our apprehensions of it are very
   different. It is one thing, for instance, to believe that God is the
   omnipotent, all-wise, and all-gracious governor of the world; and
   another, and very different thing, to have the heart powerfully
   impressed with an apprehension of his ability and readiness to help us.
   I will, therefore, a little more particularly illustrate those
   respects, in which the apprehensions of such as are really regenerate,
   differ from those which they formerly had: and I hope you will do
   yourselves the justice to reflect, as we go along, how far you have
   ever felt these apprehensions which you hear me describe. I have a
   pleasing persuasion, that many of you have felt them, in a much
   livelier manner than they can be described. I would observe then to
   you, that a regenerate soul has new apprehensions of God--of itself--of
   Christ--of eternity--and of the way and method that God has marked out
   for its being happy there.

   1. A regenerate soul has new apprehensions of the blessed God.

   There are very few who pretend so much as to doubt of the being of a
   God; and fewer yet, that will venture to deny it. And, even among those
   who have denied it, and disputed against it, some, by their own
   confession, have felt their hearts give, them the lie, and upbraid them
   for using the powers of reason and speech against the Giver and
   Preserver of both. I persuade myself at least, there are none that hear
   me this day, who would not look upon a professed Atheist as a monster,
   unworthy to be a member of human society, and little to be trusted in
   any of its relations. Yet after all, while the being of the blessed God
   is warmly asserted, his nature is so little understood and considered,
   that there are thousands who may still properly be said to be without
   God in the world, (Eph. ii. 13,) or in practice and temper, though not
   in notion, to be Atheists in it. Wicked men therefore, in general, are
   described as those that know not God; (2 Thess. i. 2;) but where God
   has determined to glorify his mercy in the salvation of a sinner, he
   shines into the heart, for his blessed purpose, to give the light of
   the knowledge of the glory of God. 2 Cor. iv. 6. And thus the glories
   of the Divine Being are known to the regenerate soul in such a manner,
   as they are not to the most acute metaphysician, or the sublimest
   philosopher, who is himself a stranger to the spiritual life.

   The person of whom we now speak, has new apprehensions of the
   spirituality and omnipresence of God,---of his majesty and purity,---of
   his power and patience,---of his goodness,---and his intimate access to
   men's spirits, with the reality and importance of his operations upon
   them. Permit me a little to represent the views of each, both to direct
   your inquiries, and also to impress your minds, and my own, with truths
   in which we have all so intimate a concern.

   The divine spirituality and omnipresence is apprehended by the good man
   in a peculiar manner. That there is some immaterial Being, and that
   matter is moved by his active power continually impressed upon it,
   according to stated laws, is indeed so plain a dictate of reason, that
   I question not but the thought influences the minds of some, who have
   not so much acquaintance with language as to be able properly to
   express it: but, alas I it easily passes through, as if no way
   important. It is quite a different thing to feel, as it were, the
   presence of an infinite, intelligent and all-observing Deity, actually
   surrounding us in all times and places: to say from the heart, O Lord,
   thou hast searched me, and known me, so that thou understandeth my
   thoughts afar off: whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall
   Iflee from thy presence? Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid
   thine hand upon me; (Psal. cxxxix. 1-7;) to feel, as it were, the hand
   of God, which indeed we may feel, if we duly attend to it, in all the
   impressions made on our bodily senses, and on the powers of our
   mind;---to feel ourselves even now supported by it, and to argue from
   the constant support of his hand, the never-failing notice of his eye.
   He reads my present thoughts; he knows, even now, all the secrets of my
   soul, and has always known them; has always observed my conduct in even
   the minutest particular; and recorded, in permanent characters, the
   whole history of my life, and of my heart; of this depraved, sinful
   life, of this vain, this treacherous, this rebellious heart.

   With this conception of the divine observance are closely and
   intimately connected new apprehensions of the purity of God, and of his
   infinite majesty; views which mutually assist and illustrate each
   other. The irreverence with which the generality of men behave in the
   presence of God, and the easiness with which they admit the slightest
   temptation to sin against him, plainly show what low notions they have
   of him; but God does, as it were, appear to the eye of a renewed mind,
   arrayed in his robes of light and majesty; so that he is ready to cry
   out, 'I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye
   seeth thee; (Job xiii. 5;) I see the eternal, self-existent,
   self-sufficient God, who sits upon the circle of the earth, and the
   inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; who spreadeth out the heavens
   as a tent to dwell in, and looks down on the nations as the drop of a
   bucket, and counts them as the small dust of the balance. Isa. xl. 15,
   22. Who would not fear before him? who would not tremble at his
   presence? (Jer. v. 22,) who would not revere that God, who is of purer
   eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look upon iniquity? (Hab. i. 13,)
   who cannot be tempted with evil, (Jam. i. 13,) but must see it, and
   hate it, even in all its forms?'

   And such too are the views it has of his almighty power, that the
   enlightened mind will further add, A God of almighty power, who could
   speak a whole world into ruin. as he spoke it into existence--who by
   one single thought, by one silent volition, could easily abase the
   proudest creature in the universe, must have it in his power to bring
   me in a moment to the dust of death, and to the flames of hell; to lay
   me as low in misery, and to hold me as long in it as he should please.
   This, O my soul, this is the God, against whom such feeble worms as we
   are daily offending, and whom we madly presume to make our enemy.'

   This gives the regenerate man a further sense of the patience of God,
   than ever he had before. Others may look round upon the world, and
   wonder there is so much penal evil in it; but the renewed soul wonders
   there is not a thousand times more. When he sees, how the world lieth
   in wickedness; (1 John v. 19;) when he observes, how poor, impotent
   mortals are, many of them perhaps, in words blaspheming the God of
   Heaven; many more of them, most presumptously violating all the
   plainest and most important precepts of his law; and most of the rest,
   living in a perpetual forgetfulness of him, as if he were not at all,
   or were not so considerable as to be any way worth their notice; such
   an one cannot but wonder, that the Almighty Majesty of Heaven does not
   in a moment make himself known by the thunder of his power, and
   confound all their madness and folly, by crushing the world, with its
   inhabitants, into ruin. He often sees the rising sun, and the
   descending rain, with astonishment that it should be sent down on such
   a world as ours.

   He has also more affecting views than ever of the Divine Goodness. Most
   men speculatively believe it; and they take occasion, even from that
   belief, to affront it; but a good man views it at once as a delightful
   and a venerable thing: he fears the Lord and his goodness; (Hos. iii.
   5;) and while it encourages him, guilty as he is, to repose himself
   upon it as his hope, it awakens a generous kind of confusion at the
   thought of ever having offended him, and fills his very soul with
   indignation at the thought of repeating such offences.

   And once more, the regenerate man has quite different notions than
   before, of the intimate access which God has to the spirits of men, and
   his power of operating upon them. The greatest part of men indeed
   consider not, as they ought, how the whole material world perpetually
   depends upon a Divine agency, and is no other than one grand machine,
   on which the great artificer continually acts, to make it an instrument
   of mercy to his sensitive and intelligent creatures. But there are yet
   fewer, who seriously consider, how entirely the hearts of men are in
   the hand of the Lord, and how much depends on his influences upon them.
   Nevertheless, experience teaches the renewed soul, that he is the God
   of the spirits of all flesh, (Numb. xxviii. 16,) and he not only views,
   but manages them as he pleases. "Lord," does he say, "this spirit of
   mine is shaded with thick darkness, but thou canst illuminate it; it is
   diseased, but thou canst cure it; it is unstable as water, (Gen. xlix.
   4,) and lighter than a feather, yet thou canst fix and establish it;
   and whatever thou wouldst have me to be, and to do, for thy glory, and
   mine own happiness, thou canst work in me both to will and to perform
   it: (Phil. ii. 13:) so that all I need, to the rectitude and felicity
   of my nature, is only this, that I may have more of thine inward,
   vital, operative presence." It is not easy to conceive, what efficacy
   this thought has, for the transformation of the soul. But again,

   2. New apprehensions are connected with these sentiments in the
   regenerate soul, concerning itself, and its own state.

   It is surprising to think, how many run through successive years in
   life, without ever turning the eye of the mind inward, that the soul
   may survey itself. I speak not of a philosophical survey of the
   faculties of the mind; which, though indeed in its place it be useful
   and entertaining, is no more necessary in its refinement to a
   well-ordered state, than skill in anatomy is to a healthful
   constitution: but I speak of those views of the mind, which are in the
   reach of all, how low soever their genius, or their education may have
   been.

   As all true happiness is an internal thing, wherever God intends to
   produce it in the heart of a revolted, corrupted creature, and such,
   alas! we all naturally are, he leads it into a view of itself; and
   shows it, if I may be allowed the expression, a mixture of grandeur and
   misery, that lies within; which yet the greatest part of mankind live
   and die without ever observing. "I am here," does the awakened creature
   say, "an intelligent being; far superior to this well-wrought frame of
   flesh and blood, which God has given me for a little while to command,
   and which I must quickly drop in the dust; I am made capable of
   determining my own choice, of directing my own actions, of judging
   concerning the importance of ends, and the propriety of means in
   subserviency to them; and while I see a vast variety of creatures in
   different forms beneath me, I see no rank of creatures above me,
   nothing nobler than man, here on earth, where I dwell. Yet I see man,
   in the midst of his glory, a feeble, dependent, mortal creature, who
   cannot possibly be his own end, nor can of himself alone, by any means
   command or ensure his own happiness. Everything tells me, that he is
   the creature of God; and that it is the greatest honor and felicity, to
   know, and practically to acknowledge himself to be so: everything tells
   me, that it is most reasonable, that God, who is the great Original of
   man, should also be the end of his being; but have I made him the end
   of mine? My soul, thou art conscious to thyself, thou hast lived in
   many instances without him in the world. Ephes. ii. 12. He has given
   thee, even in the system of thine own nature, and of the visible beings
   that are round about thee, compared with his providential interposition
   in the management of them, the intimations of his holy and righteous
   will; he has expressed these dictates far more plainly in his written
   word: and when thou comest to examine them, how art thou condemned by
   them! When thou comest to think of the spirituality and purity of his
   being, and his law, how shameful does thy temper, and thy life appear
   to have been! what an infinite disproportion is there between that, and
   its perfect rule!

   "And whom, oh my soul, hast thou offended? whose law hast thou broken?
   whose grace hast thou despised? The law, the grace of that eternal God,
   of whom I have now been hearing; who is here present with me, who is
   even within me, and who sees, O my heart, more distinctly than thou
   canst see, all thy guilt, and all its aggravations. Oh Lord! I abhor
   myself, and repent in dust and ashes. Job xlii. 6. I have talked of
   sin, and of the sentence of God against it, as a thing of course: but
   oh, my soul, it is thine own concern! The guilt, the stain of sin is
   still upon thee; the sentence of God is pronounced against thee; and it
   must be reversed, or thou art undone forever! These irregular habits
   and dispositions that prevail in thee, must be corrected, or they will
   prove thy mortal disease, and everlasting torment. Thou art a poor,
   weak, irresolute creature; the experience of every past day of life,
   since I began to think of religion at all, proves it; yet thou must, by
   some means or other, attain to inward strength and inward purity, or
   thou art lost: and all these great capacities, and glorious faculties,
   will but make thy ruin so much the more distinguished. Oh how weighty
   the care! oh how great the charge! What shall I do, that thought, that
   reason, that immortality, may not be my destruction? Where shall I find
   a rock, that will be firm enough for my support and safety? Where shall
   I find the means, to build the fabric of such a happiness as thine, O
   my soul, must be, if ever I am happy at all?"

   Thus does God teach the mind, by its inward reviews and reflections,
   this important lesson of its own impotence and guilt, of its depravity
   and ruin; and so prepares it for those new apprehensions of Christ;
   which I mentioned as the third particular.

   3. The regenerate soul has new apprehensions concerning the Lord Jesus
   Christ, considered as a Mediator in general, and as such a particular
   Mediator as he is exhibited in the word of God.

   That affecting view which the regenerate soul has of the majesty,
   glory, power, and purity of the blessed God, will undoubtedly convince
   him how unfit he is in himself to appear before his awful presence. He
   is ready to sink down in the dust at the very thought, and to say, "Who
   is able to stand before such a great and holy God, as thou art? 1 Sam.
   vi. 20. If I were in all the original rectitude and glory of my nature,
   I could not do it: how much less, surrounded as I am, with so much
   guilt, with so much pollution! I need, as it were, a daysman betwixt
   us, who might lay his hand upon us both, (Job. ix. 33,) who should
   transact affairs in my name with God, and bring the peaceful messages
   of God to me: let such an one speak with me and I will hear; but let
   not God speak with me, lest I die." Exod. xx. 19.

   And when he comes to take a more near and intimate view of this
   Mediator which GOD has exhibited in the Gospel, the renewed soul is
   even charmed and transported with the view: and that Jesus, whose name
   he before pronounced with so much coldness, that the very mention of it
   was a kind of profanation, now is regarded by him as the chiefest among
   ten thousand. Cant. v. 10. He beholds his glory, as that of the only
   begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. John i. 14. The union
   of the divine and human nature in the person of Christ, though it
   appears indeed a mystery, which he cannot fully explain, is
   nevertheless a glorious certainty, which in the general, he most
   cordially believes. He sees Emanuel--God dwelling with us in human
   flesh, and acquiesces in the sight; while the rays of Divine Glory are
   attempered by passing through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. Heb.
   x. 20. He considers Christ as made of God unto him wisdom, and
   righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; (1 Cor. i. 30:) and
   each of these views rejoices him to the very heart. "Ignorant as I am,
   I shall be taught and instructed by him, that great Prophet, whom God
   sent into the world; by him, who is incarnate wisdom, as well as
   incarnate love; whose words resound in the Gospel, and whose Spirit
   seals the instructions of his word. Guilty as I am, my crimes shall be
   expiated; for there is redemption in his blood; even the forgiveness of
   sins; (Eph. i. 7;) there is an everlasting righteousness that he has
   introduced: and oh, how richly will it adorn my soul! This pollution of
   mine shall not forever exclude me from a comfortable intercourse with
   the pure majesty of Heaven; for Christ is come to be my sanctification;
   and he can cleanse me by his Spirit, and transform me into that divine,
   delightful image which I have lost. Victorious Lord, how easily canst
   thou redeem me from that state of servitude, in which I have been kept
   so long complaining! How easily, and how powerfully, canst thou
   vindicate me into the glorious liberty of the children of God! Rom.
   viii. 21. Blessed Jesus, thou art my light and my strength, my hope and
   my joy! Thou art just such a Saviour as my necessity requires; thou
   fillest up all my wants, and all my wishes; thou art all in all to me!
   I would not be ignorant of thee for ten thousand worlds. I would not
   live a day, nor an hour, without recollecting who, and what thou art,
   and maintaining that intercourse with thee, which is the life of my
   soul."

   4. The regenerate soul has also new apprehensions of the importance of
   eternity, when compared with time and all its concerns.

   It is indeed a most pitiable thing, and awakens our astonishment,
   grief,--and indignation, to observe how the things of this world press
   down immortal spirits, and reduce them almost indeed to a state of
   brutality. Most deplorable it is, to see the power and energy of those
   motives, which are taken merely from this earth, and its little
   concernments, so that if a man did but know what was the favorite
   vanity, he might almost predict, from the knowledge of circumstances,
   how a man's actions would be ordered; and might almost be sure that he
   would follow, whithersoever this interest, or that pleasure, this
   ambitious, or that mercenary view, called him; though all the prospects
   for an eternal world pleaded the contrary way. Such is the folly and
   madness that is in men's hearts while they live; and after that they go
   down to the dead, (Eccles. ix. 3,) and spend that immortal duration,
   which they have despised, in fruitless lamentations. Fatal delusion I
   which it is the great design of the Gospel to cure.

   But when a soul becomes wise to salvation, it is taught to look not at
   the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen;
   because it has now a full sense of what before it only notionally
   confessed, that the things which are seen, are temporal; but the things
   that are not seen, are eternal! 2 Cor. iv. 18. Eternity! it is
   impossible I should tell you how much an eye, that is enlightened by
   God, sees, and reads, as it were. in that one word; while one scene
   beyond another is still opening on the mind, till its sight and its
   thoughts are swallowed up: and as the creatures are as nothing with
   respect to God, so all the interests of time, with respect to eternity,
   appear as less than nothing and vanity. Isa. xl. 17. To be made for an
   everlasting existence appears in so awful a view, that while it has
   some pleasing hope, it rejoices with trembling; and every remaining
   fear, with relation to this great interest, seems a greater evil, than
   the certainty of any temporal calamity.

   I might add upon this head, that the regenerate soul has not only new
   views of the importance, but likewise of the nature of the invisible
   and eternal state; and particularly of the nature of the celestial
   happiness. It does not consider it merely, or chiefly, as a state of
   corporeal enjoyment, formed to gratify and delight the senses; but as a
   state of perfect conformity to God, and most endearing intercourse with
   him; of which, as it begins already by Divine Grace to taste the
   pleasures, so it most ardently thirsts after them; and would be
   heartily willing to lose this body forever, and to bid an eternal adieu
   to every object capable of giving it delight; rather than it would
   consent to lose, in a perpetual succession of such objects, the sight
   of the Father of Spirits, and that sensibility of his love, which adds
   the most substantial solidity, and exalted relish, to every inferior
   good that can be desired from it.

   5. A regenerate man has also new apprehensions of the way which God has
   marked out to this happiness.

   Nothing is more common than for carnal and ignorant men to imagine,
   that it is a very easy thing to get to Heaven; and upon this
   presumption, they hew out to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that
   can hold no water; (Jer. ii. 13;) and often live and die with a lie in
   their right hand. Isa. xliv. 20. But the renewed soul, having such
   awful conceptions of the blessed God, and such apprehensions of the
   excellency and glory of the heavenly state, as you have heard, deeply
   feels how absolutely necessary it is, that something of a very great
   and important change should pass in the mind of that sinful creature,
   that ever hopes to be a partaker of it. He sees, that it is impossible
   any external profession, or external rite, should secure so great an
   end--impossible, that baptism should be regeneration, in that sense in
   which the Scripture uses the word, or that by this alone, though ever
   so regularly administered, a man's eternal happiness should be secured.
   He sees, that to be associated to this or that party of Christians, to
   join with established, or with separate churches, and to be ever so
   zealous for their respective order, worship, and discipline, is a thing
   quite of foreign consideration here; and that the best, or the worst of
   men, may be, and probably are, on one side and on another; nay, that
   ignorance, pride, and bigotry may take occasion from hence to render
   men farther from the kingdom of God, than any mistake in judgment or
   practice, on these disputed points, could have set them.

   No, my brethren, when a man's eyes are enlightened by God's renewing
   Spirit, he sees and feels that, in the language of Scripture, he must
   be created anew in Christ Jesus; (Ephes. ii. 10:) he sees, that
   holiness is a character without which no man shall see the Lord; (Heb.
   xii. 14;) and he is perhaps little anxious, whether this, or the faith
   that produces it, shall be called a condition, or a qualification, or
   an instrument, while he sees he must perish without it: he sees, that
   as it is absolutely necessary, so it is very extensive, as the
   commandment, which is its rule, is exceeding broad: (Psal. cxix. 96:)
   he sees, that it must not only effectually regulate the actions of his
   life, but control all the sentiments of his heart: nay, he sees it must
   not only be submitted to as a necessary, but be chosen as a most
   amiable thing: and, accordingly, he does choose it as such. The
   unregenerate soul, when he hears of repentance and reformation, though
   he understands not half that it means, nor is aware of what will, in
   fact, be the greatest difficulty of it, looks upon it at best as a
   nauseous medicine, which he must take, or die: but the regenerate man
   finds his heart so wonderfully and so happily changed, that he regards
   it for itself, as the food, the health, and the life of his soul; as
   that which necessarily brings its own pleasures, and, in a considerable
   degree, its own reward along with it; so that now, as David beautifully
   expresses it, He openeth his mouth, and panteth, because he longs for
   God's commandments. Verse 131.

   And I will add once more, the good man is also made sensible of the
   place which faith and holiness hold, in the scheme which God has laid,
   for our justification before him, and our acceptance with him. I do not
   say that all Christians conceive of this with equal perspicuity, or
   express their conceptions with equal exactness: the most candid
   allowance should here be made for the different ideas they fix to the
   same phrases, as they have been used to look upon them with veneration,
   or with suspicion. But this I will venture to say, because I am
   persuaded the Scripture will bear me out in it--that the confidence of
   a regenerate soul is not fixed on his own holiness, or faith, as the
   meritorious cause of his acceptance with God. He is deeply and
   cordially sensible, that he is made accepted in the Beloved; (Ephes. i.
   6;) and seeing nothing but guilt, and weakness, and ruin in himself, he
   ascribes to the blessed Jesus, and to the riches of God's free grace in
   him, his righteousness, his strength, and his salvation. And where a
   man is thus persuaded, I think he must, in effect, believe, even though
   he might scruple in words expressly to own it, "that Christ as our
   great Surety having perfectly obeyed the law of God himself, and by his
   blood having fully satisfied the Divine Justice for the breach of it,
   we, on our believing in him by a vital faith, are justified before God
   by the imputation of his perfect righteousness." This latter way of
   stating it, when rightly explained, appears just equivalent to the
   former; and it is a manner of conceiving and expressing it, which, when
   rightly understood, seems extremely suitable to that deep humility, and
   poverty of spirit, to which the renewed soul is brought, when, like a
   new-born babe, it desires the sincere milk of the word, that it may
   grow thereby. 1 Pet. ii. 2. But as the mind, at such a time, finds
   little inclination to contend about words and phrases, it would be much
   less proper for me, to enter into any controversy about them here.

   Let it suffice for the present, that I have given you this plain
   representation of that change, which is wrought in a man's
   apprehensions, when he is made a new creature. When old things are
   passed away, he has new apprehensions of God, of himself, of Christ, of
   eternity, and of the way to obtain the happiness of it: and as at this
   happy time all things are become new, there are, "new affections, new
   resolutions, new labors, new enjoyments, and new hopes," which are the
   result of the change already described. But it will be much more
   difficult to reduce what I have to offer on these heads, within the
   bounds of the next Discourse, than proper to attempt any of them in
   this. Go home, my friends, and try yourselves by what you have al.
   ready heard; and be assured, that if you are condemned by this part of
   the description, it is impossible you should be approved by any that
   will follow; since they have all their foundation in this.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] Some choose to call the change here described, renovation rather
   than regeneration. I have given my reasons, (in the Postscript,) why I
   use the words promiscuously: but I shall endeavor, through the whole of
   these Discourses, so to state the nature of this change, as to have no
   controversy with good men of any persuasion about anything but the name
   of it; concerning which, I hope, they will not contend with me, as I am
   sure I will not quarrel with them
     __________________________________________________________________

DISCOURSE III.

  OF THE NATURE OF REGENERATION, WITH RESPECT TO THE CHANGE IT PRODUCES IN MEN'S
  AFFECTIONS, RESOLUTIONS, LABORS, ENJOYMENTS AND HOPES.

  2 Cor. v. 17.

   If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed
   away, behold, all things are become new.

   AMONG the various subjects, which exercise the thoughts and tongues of
   men, few are more talked of than Religion. But it is melancholy to
   think how little it is understood; and how much it is mistaken and
   misrepresented in the world.

   The text before us gives us a very instructive view of it: such a view,
   that I am sure, an experimental knowledge of its sense would be
   infinitely preferable to the most critical and exact knowledge of all
   the most curious passages, both of the Old Testament, and the New. From
   it, you know, I have begun to describe that great change, which the
   word of God teaches us to represent under the notion of regeneration,
   or, according to the language of St. Paul, in this passage of his
   writings, by a new creation. I know I am explaining it to many, who
   have been much longer acquainted with it than myself; and it becomes me
   to believe, to many that have attained much higher advancement in it:
   but I fear also at the same time, I speak of it to many, who are yet
   strangers to it; and I am laboring, by the plainest addresses that I
   can, to give them at least some just ideas of it. Oh, that to all the
   descriptions that either have, or shall be given, God may, by his
   grace, add that understanding which arises from feeling correspondent
   impressions on the mind!

   I have already endeavored to illustrate those new apprehensions, which
   arise in the regenerate mind; apprehensions of the blessed God, of
   itself, of Christ, of the eternal world, and of the way to obtain the
   happiness of it. It now remains, that I consider those "new affections,
   resolutions, labors, enjoyments, and hopes," which result from them. I
   observe, therefore,

   II. That these new apprehensions will be attended with new Affections.

   I readily acknowledge, that the degree in which the affections operate,
   may, and will be different, in different persons, according to their
   natural constitution: but, as in some degree or another, they make an
   essential part of our frame, it is impossible but they must be
   impressed with a matter of such infinite importance, as religion will
   appear. And the apprehensions described above, must awaken the exercise
   of correspondent affections, and direct them to objects very different
   from those by which they were before excited, and on which they were
   fixed. And here now,

   1. This may be especially illustrated in love.

   Love is indeed the ruling passion of the mind, and has all the rest in
   an avowed and real subjection to it. And here lies the very root of
   human misery in our fallen and degenerate state: we are naturally
   lovers of ourselves in a very irregular degree--lovers of pleasures,
   more than lovers of God. 2 Tim. iii. 4. But, on the contrary, the first
   and great commandment of the law is written in the breast of every
   regenerate man: thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,
   and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. Matt. xxii. 37, 38. It is
   true, indeed, that if his soul were perfectly delivered into this
   mould, and his attainments in Divine love were complete, there would be
   an end of all sin, and almost of all calamity too: for what evil could
   assail or impress a mind entirely and unchangeably fixed upon God?

   Yet that the love of God should be the prevailing affection, is not
   merely a circumstance, but an essential part of true religion. While
   the good man sees Him who is invisible, (Heb. xi. 26,) as infinitely
   perfect in himself, and as the author of being and happiness to the
   whole creation, he cannot but acknowledge, that he is, beyond
   comparison, the most amiable of all objects. And though it is certain,
   that nothing can so much induce and inflame our love to God, as a
   well-grounded assurance, that he is become our God, and our Father in
   Christ; yet before the regenerate soul has attained to this, a sense of
   those favors which he received from God in common with the whole human
   race, and more especially of those which are inseparable from a
   Christian community, together with the apprehension of his being
   accessible through the Mediator, and reconcilable to sinful men, will
   diffuse some delightful sense of God over the mind; which will grow
   sweeter in proportion to the degree in which his own hopes brighten and
   settle, while they are growing toward the full assurance of faith.

   And as the real Christian loves him that begat, he loves him also that
   is begotten of him. 1 John v. 1. He loves the Lord Jesus Christ in
   sincerity, (Eph. vi. 24,) viewing him not in a cold and insensible
   manner, as he once did, but with inflamed affection, as the chiefest
   among ten thousand, and altogether lovely. Cant. v. 10, 16. If he
   knows, in any degree, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, (2 Cor. viii.
   9,) in becoming incarnate for the salvation of his people, in making
   himself a sacrifice for their sins, and paying his life for the ransom
   of their lives; he feels himself drawn toward Jesus, thus lifted up on
   the cross; (John xii. 32;) and the love of Christ constrains him, (2
   Cor. v. 14,) to such a degree, that he longs to find out some
   acceptable method to express his inward and overbearing sense of it.
   How divided soever true Christians may be in other respects, they all
   agree in this, in loving that Jesus whom they have not seen. 1 Pet. i.
   8.

   We may further recollect on this head, that the Apostle, in a solemn
   manner, adjures Christians by the love of the Spirit; (Rom. xv. 30;)
   thereby plainly implying, that such a love to him is an important
   branch of their character: and it must be so in all those who regard
   him, as every regenerate soul does, as the author of divine light and
   life, and as the source of love and happiness, by whom this love of God
   is shed abroad in the heart, (Rom. v. 5,) while it is enlarged with
   sacred delight to run the way of his commandments: (Psal. cxix. 32:) as
   that Spirit, by whom we are sealed to. the day of redemption, (Eph. ix.
   30,) and who brings down the foretastes of Heaven to the heart in which
   he dwells, and which, by his presence, he consecrates as the temple of
   God. 1 Cor. iii. 16.

   And most natural is it, that a soul filled with these impressions and
   views should overflow with unutterable joy, and feeling itself thus
   happy in an intercourse with its God, should be enlarged in love to
   man: for, says the Apostle, ye are taught of God to love one another. 1
   Thess. iv. 9. Those whom he apprehends as his brethren by regenerating
   grace, he knows are with him beloved of the Lord; and as he hopes to
   dwell with them for ever in glory, he must love them so far as he knows
   them now. And though a narrow education, and that bigotry, which
   sometimes conceals itself under very honorable and pious names, may
   perhaps influence even a sanctified heart, so far as to entertain
   unkind suspicions as to those, whose religious sentiments may differ
   from his own, and it may be, to pass some rash censures upon them; yet
   as his acquaintance with them increases, and he discerns, under their
   different forms, the traces of their common Father, his prejudices wear
   off, and that sometimes by very sensible degrees; and Christians
   receive one another, as Christ has received them all. Ro. xv. 7.

   And where the good man cannot love others with a love of complacency
   and esteem, he at least beholds them with a love of compassion and
   pity; and remembers the relation of fellow-creatures, where he sees no
   reason to hope that they are fellow-heirs with him. In a word, the
   heart is melted down into tenderness; it is warmed with generous
   sentiments; it longs for opportunities of diffusing good of all kinds,
   both temporal and spiritual, wide as its influence can reach; it beats
   with an ardor, which sometimes painfully recoils upon a man's self, for
   want of ability to help others in proportion to his desire to do it;
   and that God, who knows all the inmost workings of his mind, hears many
   an importunate intercession for others in the hour of solemn devotion,
   and many a compassionate ejaculation, which he is occasionally sending
   up to Heaven from time to time, as he passes through so sinful and so
   calamitous a world.

   These are the ruling affections in the heart of a good man; and though
   it is neither reasonable nor possible, that he should entirely divest
   himself of self-love, yet he endeavors to regulate it so, that it may
   not interfere with the more important consideration of general good.
   Self has the lowest place in his regards, nor does he limit his
   affection to a party; but aiming at extensive usefulness, he guards
   against those immoderate attachments to particular friendships, and
   those extravagant sallies of personal fondness, which are often no more
   than self-love under a specious disguise; which at once alienate the
   heart from God, and contract the social affections within very narrow,
   and those very irregular bounds; and so prove almost as fatal to the
   health of the mind, as an excessive flow of blood into one part would
   be to that of the body.

   I have enlarged so copiously on this change in the leading affections
   of the mind, that I must touch in a more transient manner on the rest.
   I add, therefore,

   2. That a regenerate soul has new aversions.

   He once hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord. Prov.
   i. 29. He hated the light, (John iii. 20,) which disclosed to the
   aching eye of his conscience the beloved and indulged irregularities of
   his heart. He hated everything that laid an embargo upon his lusts; and
   was ready to count those for his enemies that plainly admonished him,
   and secretly to dislike those whose conduct even silently reproved him.
   But now all these things are amiable to him; and those are esteemed his
   most valuable friends, whose example may be most edifying, whose
   instructions may be most useful, and whose admonitions may be most
   faithful. For he now hates every false way; (Psal. cxix. 104;) yea, and
   every vain thought too. Verse 113. He looks upon every irregular desire
   as an enemy, which he longs utterly to subdue; and especially strives
   against that sin which does most easily beset him, and abhors it more
   than he ever delighted in it. And though he rather pities than hates
   the persons of the most wretched and mischievous transgressors, yet he
   can no longer continue an endearing friendship with those, who were
   once his seducers to sin, and his companions in it. In this sense, like
   David, he hates the congregation of evil-doers, and will not sit with
   the wicked; (Psal. xxvi. 5;) and if they will not be wrought upon by
   his compassionate endeavors to reclaim them, he will soon break off the
   infectious intercourse, and say, Depart from me ye evil-doers, for I
   determine that I will keep the commandments of my God. Psal. cxix. 115.

   3. The regenerate man has also new desires.

   There was a time, when sinful passions, as the Apostle expresses it,
   did work in his members to bring forth fruit unto death. Rom. vii. 5.
   He was fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the mind, (Eph. ii.
   3,) and making provisions to fulfil the lusts of both. Rom. xiii. 14.
   But now he earnestly desires a conformity to God, as his highest
   happiness; and can look up to him, and say, "O Lord, the desire of my
   soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee; (Isa. xxvi. 8;) to
   maintain such a sense of thy presence at all times, as may influence my
   heart to think, my lips to speak, and my hands to act, in a manner
   suitable to that remembrance, and agreeable to thy wise and holy will."
   He now hungers and thirsts after righteousness; (Matt. v. 6;) feels as
   real an appetite after more advanced degrees of piety and holiness, as
   he ever felt toward the gratification of his senses; and esteems the
   proper methods of attaining these advanced degrees, even more than his
   necessary food. Job xxiii. 12. Instead of desiring to run through a
   long course of animal enjoyments, he desires to get above them; longs
   to be a pure and triumphant spirit in the refined regions of
   immortality; and is willing rather to be absent from the body, and to
   be present with the Lord. 2 Cor. v. 8.

   But I waive the farther illustration of this, till I come to consider
   the new hopes which inspire him. I therefore add, as a necessary
   consequence of these new desires,

   4. That the regenerate man has new fears.

   Pain and sorrow, disappointment and affliction, he naturally feared;
   and the forebodings of his own mind would sometimes awaken the fears of
   future punishment, according to the righteous judgment of an offended
   God: but now he fears not merely punishment, but guilt; fears the
   remonstrance of an injured conscience; for he reverences conscience as
   God's vicegerent in his bosom. He therefore fears the most secret sins,
   as well as those which might occasion public disgrace; yea, he fears,
   lest by a precipitate and inconsiderate conduct he could contract guilt
   before he is aware. He fears, lest he should inadvertently injure and
   grieve others, even the weakest and the meanest. Hte fears using his
   liberty, in a manner that might ensnare his brethren, or might occasion
   any scandal to a Christian profession: for such is the sensibility of
   his heart in this respect, that he would be more deeply concerned for
   the dishonor brought to God, and the reproach which might be thrown on
   religion by any unsuitable conduct of his, than merely for that part of
   the shame that might immediately and directly fall upon himself. But
   again,

   5. The regenerate man has new joys.

   These arise chiefly from an intercourse with God through Jesus Christ;
   and from a review of himself, as under the sanctifying influences of
   his grace, and as brought into a state of favor with him, in proportion
   to the degree in which he can discern himself in this character and
   state.

   You know David, speaking of God, calls him his exceeding joy; (Psal.
   xliii. 4;) and declares the gladness he had put into his heart, by
   lifting up the light of his countenance upon him, to be far beyond what
   they could have, whose corn and wine increased. Psal. iv. 6, 7. And the
   Apostle Paul speaks of Christians, as joying in God through Jesus
   Christ, (Rom. v. 11,) and as rejoicing in Christ Jesus: (Phil. iii. 3:)
   and Peter also describes them as those, who, believing in him, though
   unseen, rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory. 1 Pet. i. 8.

   Perhaps there was a time, when the good man censured all pretences of
   this kind, now at least in these latter days of Christianity, as an
   empty, enthusiastic pretence; but since he has tasted that the Lord is
   gracious, (1 Pet. ii. 3,) he has that experimental knowledge of their
   reality and excellence, which he can confidently oppose to all the most
   artful and sophistical cavils; and could as soon doubt, whether the sun
   enlightens his eyes, and warms his body, as he could question, whether
   God has ways of manifesting himself to souls, when it is felt with
   unutterable delight: and when thus entertained, he can adopt David's
   words, and say, that his soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness,
   so that with joyful lips he praises God, (Psal. lxiii. 5,) when his
   meditation of him is thus sweet, (Psal. civ. 34,) and God says unto his
   soul, I am thy salvation. Psal. xxxv. 3.

   The survey of the Lord Jesus Christ gives him also unutterable joy;
   while he reflects on that ample provision, which God has made by him,
   for the supply of all his necessities; and that firm security which is
   given to his soul by a believing union with Christ; whereby his life is
   connected with that of his Saviour. In his constant presence, in his
   faithful care, he can boast all the day long; (Psal. xliv. 8;) and that
   friendship, which establishes a community of interest between him and
   his Lord, engages him to rejoice in that salvation and happiness, to
   which he is advanced at the right hand of God, and gives him, by joyful
   sympathy, his part with Christ in glory, before he personally arrives
   at the full possession of it. John xiv. 28; Ephes. ii. 6.

   I add, that he also rejoices in the consciousness of God's gracious
   work upon his own soul, so far as he can discern the traces of it
   there. He delights to feel himself, as it were, cured of the mortal
   disease with which he once saw himself infected; to find himself in
   health and vigor of mind, renewed to a conformity with the Divine
   Image. He delights to look inward, and see that transformation of soul,
   which has made the wilderness like the garden of the Lord, (Isa. Ii.
   3,) so that instead of the thorn there shall come up the fir-tree, and
   instead of the brier, the myrtle. Isa. lv. 13. Thus the good man is
   satisfied from himself: (Prov. xiv. 14:) and though he humbly refers
   the ultimate glory of all to that God, by whose grace he is what he is,
   (1 Cor. xv. 10,) he enters with pleasure into his own mind, and reckons
   it a part of gratitude to his great Benefactor, to enjoy with as high a
   relish as he can, the present workings of divine grace within him, as
   well as the pleasing prospect of what it will farther do.

   But this head has so near a resemblance to some that are to follow,
   that were I to enlarge upon it, as I easily might, I should leave room
   for nothing different to be said upon them. I will only add,

   6. That as the counterpart of this, new sorrows will arise in the mind
   of a regenerate man.

   These are particularly such as spring--from the withdrawings of God's
   presence--from the remains of sin in the soul--and from the prevalence
   of it in the world about him.

   The regenerate man will mourn, when the reviving manifestations of
   God's presence are withdrawn from his soul. It seems very absurd to
   interpret the numberless passages in the sacred writers, in which they
   complain of the hidings of God's face from them, as if they merely
   referred to the want of temporal enjoyments, or to the pressure of
   temporal calamities. If the light of God's countenance, which they so
   expressly oppose to temporal blessings, signify a spiritual enjoyment,
   the want of it must relate to spiritual desertion. And I believe there
   are few Christians in the world, who are entirely unacquainted with
   this. They have most of them their seasons, when they walk in darkness,
   and see little or no light: (Isa. l. 10:) and this not only when
   anxious fears arise with relation to their own spiritual state; but at
   some other times, when, though they can in the main call God their
   father, yet he seems, as it were, to stand afar off, and to continue
   them at a distance, which wears the face of unkindness, especially
   under temptations and other afflictions, in which they lose their
   lively sense of God's presence, and that endearing freedom of converse
   with him, which, through the influence of the Spirit of adoption on
   their souls, they have sometimes known. If this be mysterious and
   unintelligible to some of you, I am heartily sorry for it; but I do not
   remember that I was ever intimately acquainted with any one, who seemed
   to me a real Christian, that has not, upon mentioning the case,
   acknowledged, that he has felt something of it. At least I will boldly
   venture to say this, that if you are truly regenerate, and do not know
   what I mean by it, it is because you have hitherto been kept in a
   continual flow of holy joy, or at least in a calm and cheerful
   persuasion of your interest in the Divine favor: and even such may see
   the day, when strong as their mountain seems to stand, God may hide his
   face to their trouble: (Psal. xxx. 7:) or, however, they will infer
   from what they now feel, that it must be a mournful case whenever it
   occurs; and that sorrow, in such circumstance, will soon strike on a
   truly sanctified heart, and wound it very deep.

   The sorrow of a good man also arises "from the remains of sin in his
   soul." Though he is upright before God, and proves it by keeping
   himself from his iniquity; (Psal. xviii. 23;) yet he cries out, Who can
   understand his errors? Psal. xix. 12. Who can say I have made my heart
   clean, I am pure from my sin? Prov. xx. 9. A sense of the sinfulness of
   his nature humbles him in the dust; and the first risings of irregular
   inclinations and passions give him a tender pain, with which a carnal
   heart is unacquainted, even when sin is domineering within him.

   And once more, "The prevalence of sin in the world around him," is a
   grief to one that is born of God. It pierces him to the heart to see
   men dishonoring God, and ruining themselves: he beholds transgressors,
   as David well expresses it, with a mixture of indignation and sorrow;
   (Psal. cxxxix. 21;) and when he seriously considers how common, and yet
   how sad a case it is, he can perhaps borrow the words of the same
   prophet, so far as to say, that rivers of waters run down his eyes,
   because men keep not the law of God. Psal. cxix. 136. Now, as these are
   sorrows that seldom do at all affect the heart of an unregenerate man,
   I thought it the more proper to mention them, to assist you in your
   inquiries into your own state.

   Such are the affections of love and aversion, of desire and fear, of
   joy and sorrow, which fill the breast of the regenerate man, and
   naturally arise from those new apprehensions which are described under
   the former head. I add,

   III. That he has also new RESOLUTIONS.

   You will easily apprehend I speak of those that are formed for the
   service of God, and against sin. I readily acknowledge, that there are
   often, in unregenerate men, some resolutions of this kind, and perhaps
   those very warm, and for the present very sincere; yet there is
   considerable difference between them and those we are now to represent;
   as the resolutions of the truly good man are more universal, more
   immediate, and more humble.

   1. The resolutions which he now forms, are more universal than they
   ever were before.

   He does not now resolve against this or that sin, but against all;
   against sin, as sin; as opposite to the holiness of God, and
   destructive of the honor and happiness of the rational creation. He
   does not say with Naaman, concerning this or that more convenient
   iniquity, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing; (2 Kings v. 18;)
   nor does he resolve to excuse himself in an indulgence, even of that
   sin which does most easily beset him; (Heb. xii. 1;) but rather, in his
   general determination against sin, and in those solemn engagements,
   with which such determinations may be attended, he fixes especially
   upon those sins which he might before have been most ready to accept.

   2. The resolutions of the regenerate man are more immediate.

   It very frequently happens, that while others are under awakening
   impressions, as they see a necessity for parting with their sins, and
   engaging in what they may call a religious life, they resolve upon it:
   but then they think it may be delayed a little longer; perhaps a few
   years, or at least a few weeks or days; or they, perhaps, refer it to
   some remarkable period which is approaching, which they flatter
   themselves they shall make yet more remarkable, as the era of their
   reformation: but, in the mean time, they will take their farewell of
   their lusts by a few more indulgences: and thus they delude themselves,
   and rivet their chains faster than before. But the good man, with
   David, makes haste, and delays not to keep the commandments of God.
   Psal. cxix. 60. He is like the prodigal, who, as soon as ever he said,
   I will arise and go to my father, immediately arose and came to him.
   Luke xv. 18, 20. He reckons the time he has already spent in the
   service of sin may suffice, (1 Pet. v. 3,) and that indeed it is far
   more than enough: he wishes he could call back that which is past; but
   he determines, that he will not take one step further. in this unhappy
   path. He fully purposes, that he will never once more deliberately and
   presumptuously offend God, in any matter, great or small; if anything
   can be called small, which is a deliberate and apprehended offence; and
   he determines, that from this moment he will yield himself to God, as
   alive from the dead, and employ his members as instruments of
   righteousness. Rom. vi. 13. But then,

   3. His resolutions are more modest and humble than they have ever been
   before.

   And this indeed is the great circumstance that renders them more
   effectual. When an awakened sinner feels himself most enslaved to his
   vices, he pleases himself with this thought, that there is a secret
   kind of spring in his mind, which, when he pleases to exert, he can
   break through all at once, and commence, whenever the necessity comes
   upon him, a very religious man in a moment. And when conscience presses
   him with the memory of past guilt, and the representation of future
   danger, he cuts off these remonstrances with a hasty resolve, "I will
   do so no more;" but then, perhaps, the effects of this may not last a
   day; though possibly it may, at other times, continue a few weeks or
   months, where the grosser acts of sin are concerned: and indeed his
   resolutions seldom reach farther than these; for the necessity of a
   sanctified heart is a mystery which he has never yet learned. But a
   truly regenerate man has learned wisdom from this experience of his
   own, and the observation of other men's frailty. He feels his own
   weakness, and is so thoroughly aware of the treachery of his own heart,
   that he is almost afraid to express in words the purpose which his very
   soul is forming: he is almost afraid to turn that purpose into a vow
   before God, lest the breach of that vow should increase his guilt: but
   this he can say, with repenting Ephraim, Lord turn thou me, and I shall
   be turned; (Jer. xxxi. 18;) and with David, Hold up my goings in thy
   paths, that my footsteps may not slip. Psal. xvii. 5. "I am exceeding
   frail; but, Lord, be thou surety for thy servant for good, (Psal. cxix.
   122,) and then I shall be safe! Do thou rescue me from temptations, and
   I shall be delivered! Do thou fill my heart with holy sentiments, and I
   will breathe them out before thee! Do thou excite and maintain a zeal
   for thy service, and then I will exert myself in it!" And when once a
   man is come to such a distrust of himself; when, like a little child,
   he stretches out his hand to be led by his heavenly Father, and trusts
   in his guardian care alone for his security and comfort; then out of
   weakness he is made strong, (Heb. xi. 34,) and goes on safe though
   trembling; and sees those that made the loudest boasts, and placed the
   greatest confidence in themselves, falling on the right hand and on the
   left, and their bravery melting away like snow before the sun.

   IV. The regenerate man has new LABORS and EMPLOYMENTS.

   Not that his former employment in secular life is laid aside: it would
   ordinarily be a very dangerous snare for a man to imagine that God
   requires this. On the contrary, the Apostle gives it in charge to
   Christian converts, that in what calling soever a man is found when he
   is called into the profession of the Gospel, he should therein abide
   with God. 1 Cor. vii. 20, 24. But when he becomes a real Christian he
   prosecutes this calling, whatever it be, with a new spirit and temper,
   from new principles, and to new purposes. While his hands are laboring
   in the world, his heart is often rising to God; he consecrates his work
   to the Divine honor, and to the credit of religion; and desires, that
   his merchandise and his gain may, in this sense, be holiness to the
   Lord, (Isa. xxiii. 18,) by employing it to support the family which
   Providence has committed to his charge, (1 Tim. v. 8,) and to relieve
   the poor whom Christ recommends to his pity; (Acts xx. 35;) and as he
   depends upon God to give him wisdom and success ii. the conduct of his
   affairs, he ascribes the glory of that success to him; not sacrificing
   to his own net, nor burning incense to his own drag. Hab. i. 16.

   And I will further add, that regeneration introduces a set of new
   labors, added to the former, with which the man was before utterly
   unacquainted. We may consider, as the principal and chief of these, the
   great labor of purifying the heart, of conquering sinful inclinations,
   and affections, and of approaching God by a more intimate access and
   more endeared converse. Now they that imagine this to be an easy
   matter, know little of the human heart, little of the spirituality of
   God's nature, and his law.

   Give me leave to say, that the labors of the body, in cultivating the
   earth, are much more easily performed than this spiritual husbandry. To
   weed a soil so luxuriant in evil productions, and to raise a plentiful
   harvest of holy affections and actions in a soil so barren of good; to
   regulate appetites and passions so exorbitant as those of the human
   heart naturally are, and to awaken in it suitable affections; to be
   abundant in the fruits of righteousness, and to converse with God in
   the exercise of devotion: these are no little things; nor will a little
   resolution, watchfulness, and activity suffice, in order to the
   discharge of such a business. It is comparatively easy to go through
   the forms of prayer and praise, whatever they are: to read, or from
   present conception to utter, a few words before God: but to unite the
   heart in God's service, to. wrestle with him for a blessing, to pour
   out the heart before him, to speak to him as searching the very heart;
   so that He should say, "This is prayer:" this, my brethren, is a work
   indeed; and he that is conscientious in the discharge of it will find,
   that it is not to be dispatched in a few hasty moments, nor without
   serious reflection, and a resolute watch maintained over the spirit.

   New labors also arise to the regenerate soul, in consequence of the
   concern it has to promote religion in the world. Being possessed, as I
   formerly showed you the heart of the good man is, with an unfeigned
   love to his fellow-creatures, and knowing of how great importance
   religion is to the happiness of men, he pleads earnestly with God for
   the propagation and success of the Gospel: and he endeavors, according
   to his ability and opportunity, to promote it; to promote pure and
   undefiled religion in his family and his neighborhood, even in all
   around him. And this requires observation and application, that this
   attempt may be prudently conducted, and great resolution, in order to
   its being rendered effectual: it requires great diligence in watching
   over ourselves, lest our examples prove inconsistent with our precepts;
   and no small degree of courage, considering how averse the generality
   of mankind are to admonitions and reproofs; in consequence of which, a
   person can hardly act the part of a faithful friend, without exposing
   himself to the hazard of being accounted an enemy.

   Such are the new labors of the real Christian. Let any man try to
   perform them, and he will not find them light; but to encourage the
   attempt, let me further add,

   V. That the regenerate soul has its new ENTERTAINMENTS too.

   He has pleasures, which a stranger intermeddles not with, (Prov. xiv.
   10,) and which the world can neither give, nor take away: (John xvi.
   22:) pleasures, which a thousand times overbalance the most painful
   labors, and the most painful sufferings too; and which, sweetly
   mingling themselves with the various circumstances of life, through
   which the Christian passes, do, as it were, gild all the scene, and
   make all the fatigues and self-denial of his life far more agreeable,
   than any of those delights the worldling, or the sensualist, can find
   in the midst of his unbounded and studied indulgences. But here I shall
   be in great danger of repeating what I said under a former head, when I
   was speaking of the new joys which the Christian feels, in consequence
   of the great change that regeneration makes in his soul: and therefore,
   omitting what I then observed, concerning the pleasure of communion
   with God through Christ, and of perceiving a work of Divine grace upon
   the soul, I shall now touch upon some other sources of exalted
   entertainment, which did not so directly fall under that head.

   1. The Christian finds new pleasures in the word of God.

   You know with what relish the saints of old spake of it. Thy words were
   found, says the Prophet, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me
   the joy and rejoicing of mine heart. Jer. xv. 16. Thy statutes, says
   the Psalmist, are more to be desired than gold, yea, than much fine
   gold: they are sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb. Psal. xix.
   10. The apostle Peter beautifully represents this, when he exhorts the
   saints to whom he wrote, as new-born babes to desire the sincere milk
   of the word, that they might grow thereby. 1 Pet. ii. 2. And the infant
   that smiles on the breast, and with such eagerness and delight draws
   its nourishment from it, seems an amiable image of the humble
   Christian, who receives the kingdom of God, and the word of that
   kingdom, as a little child; (Mark x. 15;) who lays up Scripture in his
   heart, (Job xxii. 22,) and draws forth the sweetness of it, with a firm
   persuasion, that it is indeed the word of God, and was appointed by him
   for the food of his soul.

   2. He also finds new pleasures in the ordinances of Divine worship.

   He is glad when it is said unto him, Let us go into the house of the
   Lord. Psal. cxxii. 1. He indeed esteems the tabernacles of the Lord, as
   amiable, and regards a day in his courts as better than a thousand
   elsewhere. Psal. lxxxiv. 1, 10. And this pleasure arises, not merely
   from anything peculiar in the administrations of this or that man who
   officiates in holy things; but from the nature of the exercise in
   general, and from a regard to the Divine authority of those
   institutions which are there observed. He feels a sacred delight in an
   intercourse with God in those solemnities; in comparison of which, all
   the graces of composition and delivery appear as little as the harmony
   of instruments, or the perfume of incense, to one of the Old Testament
   saints, when compared with the light of God's countenance, which was
   lifted up on the pious worshipers under the Mosaic forms, when in his
   temple every one spake of his glory. Psal. xxix. 9. One thing has he
   desired of the Lord, and that he seeks after, that he may dwell in the
   house of the Lord all the days of his life; not to amuse his vain
   imagination, not to gratify his ear, not to indulge his curiosity with
   useless inquiries, nor merely to exercise his understanding with
   sublime speculations; but to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to
   inquire in his temple. Psal. xxxvii. 4.

   3. He likewise finds a new entertainment in the conversation of
   Christian friends.

   He now knows what it is to have fellowship with those whose communion
   is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 1 John i. 3. His
   delight is now in them that are truly the excellent of the earth. Psal.
   xvi. 3. He delights to dismiss the usual topics of modern conversation,
   that some religious subject may be taken up, not as matter of dispute,
   but as matter of devout recollection; and loves to hear the plainest
   Christian express his experimental sense of divine things. Those
   sentiments of piety and love, which come warm from a gracious heart,
   are always pleasing to him; and those appear the dearest bands of
   friendship, which may draw him nearer to his heavenly Father, and unite
   his soul in ties of more ardent love to his Redeemer. A society of such
   friends is indeed a kind of anticipation of heaven; and to choose, and
   to delight in such, is no contemptible token, that the soul has
   attained to some considerable degree of preparation for it. I only add,

   VI. That in consequence of all this, the regenerate soul has new HOPES
   and PROSPECTS.

   Men might be very much assisted in judging of their true state, if they
   would seriously reflect what it is they hope and wish for. What are
   those expectations and desires that most strongly impress their minds?
   A vain mortal, untaught and unchanged by Divine grace, is always
   dressing up to himself some empty phantom of earthly happiness, which
   he looks after and pursues, and foolishly imagines, "Could I grasp it,
   and keep it, I should be happy." But Divine grace teaches the real
   Christian to give up these empty schemes. "God," he says, "never
   intended this world for my happiness: he will make it tolerable to me;
   he will give me so much of it as he sees consistent with my highest
   interest; he will enable me to derive instruction, and it may be
   consolation, out of its disappointments and distresses: but he reserves
   my inheritance for the eternal world. I am begotten again to a lively
   hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, even to the
   hope of an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth
   not away; (1 Pet. i. 3, 4:) and though it be, for the present reserved
   in heaven, it is so safe, and so great, that it is well worth my
   waiting for, though ever so long; for the things that are not seen, are
   eternal." 2 Cor. iv. 18.

   And this indeed is the true character of a good man. Eternity fills his
   thoughts; and growing sensible, in another manner than he ever was
   before, of the importance of it, he pants after the enjoyment of
   eternal happiness. Assign any limited duration to his enjoyment of God
   in the regions of glory, and you would overwhelm him with
   disappointment: talk of hundreds, of thousands, of millions of years,
   the disappointment is almost equal: periods like these seem scarce
   distinguishable from each other, when compared with an eternal hope. To
   eternity his desires and expectations are raised; and he can be
   contented with nothing less than eternity; perfect holiness, and
   perfect happiness for ever and ever, without any mixture of sin, or any
   alloy of sorrow; this he firmly expects, this he ardently breathes
   after; a felicity which an immortal soul shall never outlive, and which
   an eternal God shall never cease to communicate. This heavenly country
   he seeks; he considers himself as a citizen of it, and endeavors to
   maintain his conversation there; (Phil. iii. 20;) to carry on, as it
   were, a daily trade for heaven, and to lay up a treasure there; (Matt.
   vi. 20;) in which he may be rich and great, when all the pomp of this
   earth is passed away as a dream, and all its most precious metals and
   gems are melted down and consumed among its vilest materials in the
   last universal burning.

   This is the change, the glorious change, which regeneration makes in a
   man's character and views; and who shall dare to speak, or to think
   contemptibly of it? Were we indeed to represent it as a kind of charm,
   depending on an external ceremony, which it was the peculiar
   prerogative of a certain order of men to perform, and yet on which
   eternal life was suspended; one might easily apprehend, that it would
   be brought into much suspicion. Or should we place it in any mechanical
   transports of animal nature, in any blind impulse, in any strong
   feelings, not to be described, or accounted for, or argued upon, but
   known by some inward inexplicable sensation to be divine; we could not
   wonder, if calm and prudent men were slow to admit the pretension to
   it, and were fearful it might end in the most dangerous enthusiasm,
   made impious by excessive appearances of piety. But when it is
   delineated by such fair and bright characters as those that have now
   been drawn; when these divine lineaments on the soul, by which it bears
   the image of its Maker's rectitude and sanctity, are considered as its
   necessary consequence, or rather as its very essence; one would
   imagine, that every rational creature, instead of caviling at it,
   should pay an immediate homage to it, and earnestly desire, and labor,
   and pray, to experience the change: especially as it is a change so
   desirable for itself--as we acknowledge health to be, though a man were
   not to be rewarded for doing well, nor punished, any farther than with
   the malady he contracts, for any negligence in this respect.

   Where is there anything can be more ornamental to our natures, than to
   have all the powers of the mind thus changed by grace, and our pursuits
   directed to such objects as are worthy of the best attention and
   regard?--to have our apprehensions of divine and spiritual things
   enlarged, and to have right conceptions of the most important
   matters;---to have the stream of our affections turned from empty
   vanities, to objects that are proper to excite and fix them;--to have
   our resolutions set against all sin, and a full purpose formed within
   us of an immediate reformation and return to God, with a dependence on
   his grace to help us both to will and to do;---to have our labors
   steadfastly applied to conquer sin, and to promote religion in
   ourselves and others; to have our entertainments founded in a religious
   life, and flowing in upon us from the sweet intercourse we have with
   God in his word and ordinances, and the delightful conversation that we
   sometimes have with Christian friends;--and finally, to have our hopes
   drawn off from earthly things, and fixed upon eternity?

   Where is there anything can be more honorable to us, than thus to be
   renewed after the image of him that created us, (Col. iii. 10,) and to
   put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and
   true holiness? Eph. iv. 24. And where is anything that can be more
   desirable, than thus to have the darkness of our understandings cured,
   and the disorders rectified, that sin had brought upon our nature? Who
   is there that is so insensible of his depravity, as that he would not
   long for such a happy change? Or who is there that knows how excellent
   a work it is, to be transformed by the renewing of the mind, (Rom. xii.
   2,) that would not, with the greatest thankfulness, adore the riches of
   Divine grace, if it appear that he is thus become a new creature; that
   old things are passed away, and behold, all things are become new?

   But I shall quickly show you, that regeneration is not only ornamental,
   honorable, and desirable, but absolutely necessary, as ever we would
   hope to share the blessings of God's heavenly kingdom, and to escape
   the horror of those that are finally and irrevocably excluded from it.
   This argument will employ several succeeding Discourses.

   But I would dismiss you at present with an earnest request, that you
   would, in the mean time, renew your inquiries, as to the truth of
   regeneration in your own souls; which, after all that I have been
   saying, it will be very inexcusable for you to neglect, as probably you
   will hear few discourses, in the whole course of your lives, which
   centre more directly in this point, or are more industriously
   calculated to give you the safest and clearest assistance in it. May
   God abase the arrogance and presumption of every self-deceiving sinner;
   and awaken the confidence and joy of the feeblest soul, in whom this
   new creation is begun!

DISCOURSE IV.

  THE NECESSITY OF REGENERATION, ARGUED FROM THE IMMUTABLE CONSTITUTION OF GOD.

  John III. 3.

   Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
   Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

   WHILE the ministers of Christ are discoursing of such a subject, as I
   have before me in the course of these Lectures, and particularly in
   this branch of them which I am now entering upon, we may surely, with
   the utmost reason, address our hearers in those words of Moses to
   Israel, in the conclusion of his dying discourse: Set your hearts unto
   all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall
   command your children to observe and do, even all the words of this
   law; for it is not a vain thing for you, because it is your life. Deut.
   xxxii. 46, 47. That must undoubtedly be your life, concerning which the
   Lord Jesus Christ himself, the incarnate wisdom of God, the faithful
   and true witness, (Rev. iii. 14,) has said, and said it with a solemn
   repeated asseveration, that without it a man cannot see the kingdom of
   God.

   The occasion of his saying it deserves our notice; though the niceties
   of the context must be waived in such a series of sermons as this. He
   said it to a Jew of considerable rank, and, as it appears, one of the
   grand Sanhedrim, or chief council of the nation; who came not only for
   his own private satisfaction, but in the name of several of his
   brethren, to discourse with Christ concerning his doctrine, at the
   first passover' he attended at Jerusalem, after he had entered on his
   public ministry. Our Lord would, to be sure, be peculiarly careful what
   answer he returned to such an inquiry: and this is his answer, Verily,
   verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the
   kingdom of God: as if he should have said, "If the princes of Israel
   inquire after my character, let them know that I came to be a preacher
   of regeneration; and that the blessings of that kingdom, which I am
   come to reveal and erect, are to be peculiar to renewed and sanctified
   souls; who may, by an easy and natural figure, be said to be born
   again." And the figure appears very intelligible, and very instructive
   to those that will seriously consider it; and might well lead us into a
   variety of pertinent and useful remarks.

   You easily perceive, that to be born again must intimate a very great
   change; coming, as it were, into a new world, as an infant does; when
   after having lived awhile a kind of vegetative life in the darkness and
   confinement of the womb, it is born into open day; feels the vital air
   rushing in on its lungs, and light forcing itself upon the awakened
   eyes; hears sounds before unknown; opens its mouth to receive a yet
   untasted food, and every day becomes acquainted with new objects, and
   exerts new powers, till it grows up to the maturity of a perfect man.
   Such, and in some respects greater and nobler than this, is the change
   which regeneration makes in a heart, before unacquainted with religion:
   as you may have seen at large from the preceding discourses.

   But I might further observe, that the phrase in the text may also
   express the humbling nature of this change, as well as the greatness of
   it. Erasmus gives this turn to the words; and it is so edifying, that I
   should have mentioned it at least, though I had not thought it so just,
   as it appears. To be born again, must signify to become as a little
   child; (Matt. xviii. 3;) and our Lord expressly and frequently assures
   us, that without this we cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Mark
   x. 15; Luke xviii. 17. He has pronounced the very first of his
   blessings on poverty of spirit; (Matt. v. 3;) and where this is
   wanting, the soul will never be entitled to the rest. A mild and
   humble, a docile and tractable temper, a freedom from avarice and
   ambition, and an indifference to those great toys of which men are
   generally so fond, are all essential parts of the Christian character;
   and they have all, in one view or another, been touched upon in the
   preceding discourses. Let it be forgiven, however, if considering the
   importance of the case, you are told again, that in malice ye must be
   children; (1 Cor. xiv. 20;) and that if any man think himself wise, he
   must become a child, and even a fool, that he may be wise indeed. 1
   Cor. iii. 18.

   I might observe once more, that these words intimate the divine power,
   by which this great and humbling change is effected. Our first
   formation and birth is the work of God, and no less really so in the
   succeeding generations of men, than the first production of Adam was,
   when God formed him of the dust of the earth, and breathed into his
   nostrils the breath of life. Gen. ii. 7. We may each of us say, with
   respect to the natural birth, and in an accommodated sense with respect
   to the spiritual too, thine eyes did see my substance, being as yet
   imperfect, and in thy book all my members, which in continuance of time
   were fashioned, were written, when as yet there was none of them. Psal.
   cxxxix. 16. All the first gracious impressions that were made upon the
   mind, and all the gradual advances of them, till Christ was formed in
   the heart, and the new creature animated, must, as I shall hereafter
   show at large, be ultimately and principally referred into a divine
   operation; and in this sense, it is God that brings every good purpose
   in the mind to the birth, and God that gives strength to bring forth.
   Isa. lxvi. 9.

   But I omit the farther prosecution of these remarks at present, because
   they coincide with what I have said in former discourses, or what will
   occur in those which are yet to come: and shall only further consider
   the words, as they are a confirmation of, and therefore a proper
   introduction to, what I am to lay before you under the third general
   head of these discourses; in which--as I have already shown who may be
   said to be in an unregenerate state, and how great that change is which
   regeneration makes in the soul--I shall now proceed,

   Thirdly, to show the high importance, yea, the absolute NECESSITY of
   this change.

   Our Lord expresses it in a very lively and awakening manner, in these
   few determinate words, which are here before us.: Verily, verily, I say
   unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
   God. You see how emphatical the words are: he who is himself invariable
   truth, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever, (Heb. xiii. 8,) repeats
   it again and again, with as much solemnity as he ever uses upon any
   occasion; repeats it to us, as he did to Nicodemus, "Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, that is, I seriously deliver it as a truth of infinite
   moment; except a man, i. e. any man, whatever his profession, whatever
   his knowledge, or whatever his privileges, may be; though he be a Jew,
   though he be a Pharisee, though he be, as thou Nicodemus art, a ruler
   or a senator; except he be born again, and have that great change, so
   often described in the word of God, wrought by the operation of the
   Spirit in his mind, he cannot see the kingdom of God: he cannot by any
   means approach it so as to enter into it, or have any share in the
   important blessings which it contains."

   That we may more fully understand, and enter into this weighty
   argument, I shall from these words,

   I. Briefly consider, what it is to see the kingdom of God.

   II. Show how absolutely impossible it is, that any unregenerate man
   should see it. And,

   III. How wretched a thing it is to be deprived of the sight and
   enjoyment of it.

   And I am well persuaded, that if you diligently attend to these things,
   you will be inwardly and powerfully convinced, that no argument could
   be more proper to demonstrate the importance and necessity of
   regeneration, than this, which our Lord has suggested in these awful,
   emphatical, and comprehensive words.

   I. I am to show you what it is to see the kingdom of God.

   And for the explication of it, it will be necessary to consider--what
   we are to understand by this kingdom; and what is meant by seeing it.

   I will show you now what we are to understand by the kingdom of God.
   And you will pardon me if I state the matter pretty largely; because
   the phrase is used in scripture in different senses; and the true
   interpretation of many passages in it depends on a proper distinction
   between them. You may observe then, for the explication of this phrase,
   that the kingdom of God in general signifies, 'the society of those,
   who profess themselves the servants and subjects of Christ;' and in
   consequence of this, that there are some passages, in which it
   peculiarly relates to the imperfect dispensation of this kingdom, and
   the beginning of it in the world; and others, in which it relates to
   the more perfect form, which this society is to bear in the world of
   glory.

   1. The kingdom of God, or the kingdom of heaven--for they are
   synonymous phrases--does in the general signify the society of those,
   who profess themselves the servants and subjects of Christ.

   You well know this was a phrase used among the Jews: and therefore the
   original of it is to be traced from the Old Testament; and I apprehend
   it to be this: Almost every Christian is aware, that in the early days
   of the Jewish commonwealth, as Samuel with great propriety expresses
   it, God was their king. 1 Sam. xii. 12. Jehovah was not only the great
   object of their religious regard, as the creator and supporter of the
   whole world; but he was also their supreme civil magistrate, settling
   the forms of their political government, and reserving to himself some
   of the chief acts of royal authority. They did indeed afterwards desire
   another king, like the other nations around about them. 1 Sam. viii. 5.
   But still those kings, being appointed by God, were indeed to be looked
   upon as no other than his vicegerents, though another kind of governors
   than he had originally instituted.

   By degrees their peculiar regard to the civil authority of God among
   them, as well as to his religious authority, which was nearly connected
   with it, in a great measure wore out; and their government went through
   a great many different forms, which it would be unnecessary here
   particularly to describe. Nevertheless, God was pleased to declare by
   king David, and by many others of his holy prophets, that he would in
   due time interpose to erect another, and a far more extensive kingdom
   in the world; not indeed upon the same political principles with that
   which he exercised over the Jews; which principles would by no means
   have suited this extensive design: but it should be a kingdom in which
   the authority of the God of heaven should be acknowledged, and his laws
   of universal righteousness observed with greater care, and to nobler
   purposes, as well as by a vastly greater number of subjects than ever
   before. This kingdom he determined to commit to the government of the
   Messiah, who, with regard to this was called the Lord's anointed, his
   king whom he set upon his holy hill of Zion; (Psal. ii. 2, 6;) and to
   whom indeed he would give all power, not only on earth, but in heaven
   too; (Matt. xxviii. 18;) so that having trained up his subjects here,
   in the discipline of holiness and obedience, he should at length
   translate them to another and a better country, that is, a heavenly,
   where they should see his glory, and should reign with him in eternal
   life.

   This plainly appears from the whole tenor of the Old and New Testament,
   to have been the grand plan of God, with respect to the Messiah's
   kingdom: and you will easily see, that coming from God as its great
   author, and referring to him as its end, it may, with great propriety,
   be called the kingdom of God; and ultimately terminating in the
   heavenly state, it may also properly be called the kingdom of heaven.
   These were phrases, which prevailed in the Jewish nation, before
   Christ, or his immediate forerunner appeared; and indeed they were used
   by Daniel in a very remarkable manner, which probably made them so
   familiar to the Jews, who had some peculiar reason for studying his
   writings, even more than those of some other prophets. After that
   prophet had foretold the rise and fall of several great empires of the
   world, he adds, and in the days of these last kings, i. e. of the
   Romans, shall the God of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall not be
   destroyed,---but shall stand forever. Dan. ii. 44. And the person whom
   the Ancient of Days, i. e. the eternal and ever blessed God, should fix
   on the throne of this kingdom, from his appearing in the human nature,
   is called the Son of Man; (Dan. vii. 13, 14;) "I saw in the night
   visions, and behold, one like the Son of Man, came with the clouds of
   heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near
   before him; and there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
   that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion
   is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom
   that which shall not be destroyed."

   In allusion to this, when our Lord Jesus Christ appeared, he called
   himself the Son of Man; and he particularly used this phrase, and it
   was exceedingly proper that he should, in this conference with
   Nicodemus, again and again. John iii. 13, 14. And all those who, being
   convinced of the divine commission he bore, submitted themselves to
   him, might in this respect be said, to enter into the kingdom of God,
   or of heaven: that is, into the society which had so long been foretold
   and expected under that title. This kingdom, as the above mentioned
   prophecy declared, was to be raised from very low beginnings, and under
   the personal ministry of Christ and his Apostles, till at last it
   should extend through very distant regions of the world, and kings and
   princes should submit themselves to it, and reckon it their glory to
   enroll themselves among his subjects.

   Agreeably to this meaning of the phrase, and to this view with respect
   to the establishment of his kingdom, our Lord opened his ministry with
   preaching, as John the Baptist had done, the kingdom of heaven. Matt.
   iii. 2; iv. 1. And you will see, that in most places of the Gospel,
   where the phrase occurs, it is to be taken in this sense. Thus our Lord
   says, Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of
   heaven; (Matt. v. 3;) i. e. they are fit to be members of this society,
   and to receive the blessings of it. Seek first the kingdom of God, and
   his righteousness; (Matt. vi. 33;) i. e. labor to serve the interests
   of this society that I am erecting, and to obtain and promote that
   righteousness which it recommends, and is intended to establish in the
   world. And again, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid
   them not; for of such is the kingdom of God: (Luke xviii. 16;) persons
   with such a disposition are most fit to become my subjects, and to
   enter into this holy and spiritual society. And when our Lord says to,
   the Pharisees, Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before
   you; (Mark xxi. 31;) he means, no doubt, they are more ready than you
   to join themselves to the society of those who profess themselves my
   subjects. And once more, when he speaks of some who chose the
   severities of a single life, that with less entanglements they might
   serve the interests of his church, he expresses it, by their making
   themselves eunuchs, for the kingdom of heaven's sake. Matt. xiv. 12.

   I shall only add, that the phrase, by a near connection with this
   sense, sometimes signifies the character of this society, or the
   privileges which it affords to its members; as when our Lord says,
   Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall
   in no wise enter therein. Luke xviii. 17.

   This then is the general sense of this phrase; it signifies the society
   of those who should submit themselves to the government of Christ, as
   appointed by God to rule over them; who are thereby to be considered as
   God's people and subjects. In consequence of this you will easily
   apprehend,

   2. That it comprehends the more imperfect dispensation, under which the
   members of this society are, during their abode in the present world.

   All that passes here is indeed but the opening of Christ's kingdom:
   nevertheless, the phrase does sometimes more particularly refer to this
   opening; and there are several passages, in which it would be
   apparently absurd to suppose it comprehended the glories of the
   invisible state, to which Christ intended finally to conduct his
   faithful servants. Thus our Lord tells the Pharisees, The kingdom of
   God is come unto you, (Matt. xii. 28,) i. e. that gracious dispensation
   under the Messiah, by which God is gathering subjects to his Son. And
   elsewhere he says to them, The kingdom of God cometh not with
   observation, i. e. not with such outward show and grandeur as you
   expect; but behold it is within, or, (as it might be rendered,) among
   you; (Luke xvii. 20, 21;) God has begun to open and establish it,
   though you know it not; and has actually brought many poor sinners into
   it, whom you proudly deride as ignorant and accursed. Thus also, when
   our Lord says to Peter, I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
   of heaven, (Matt. xvi. 19,) it would be most absurd to suppose, he
   meant to grant to him the power of admitting into, or excluding from,
   the world of glory: but the plain meaning is, that he should bear
   office in the church on earth, and be the means of admitting Jews and
   Gentiles into it. Here, as in many other instances, the kingdom of God,
   or of heaven, means much the same with the professing church of Christ,
   in this imperfect state; as it undoubtedly does, when Christ threatens
   his hearers, that the kingdom of God should be taken away from them;
   (Matt. xxi. 43;) and when he represents it as consisting of good and
   bad, (Matt. xiii. 48,) of tares and wheat; (Verse 25,) but declares,
   that at the last day he will gather out of his kingdom all things that
   offend, and them that do iniquity; (Matt. xiii. 41;) whereas nothing of
   that kind shall ever enter into the kingdom of glory. But yet,

   3. It ultimately relates to the more perfect form and state of this
   society in the kingdom of glory.

   You very well know, that the design of God in his Gospel was not to
   establish a temporal kingdom, as the Jews expected: nor merely to form
   a body of men, who should live upon earth with some peculiar forms of
   worship, under very excellent rules, and with distinguished privileges
   of a spiritual nature; but that all these ultimately referred to the
   invisible world. Thither the Son of Man was removed, when he had
   finished the scenes of his labor and sufferings upon earth; and thither
   all the true and faithful members of the kingdom were sooner or later
   to be brought, and there were to have their final settlement and
   everlasting abode, in a far more splendid and happy state, than the
   greatest monarch on earth has ever known: they shall there, as the
   Apostle most properly expresses it, reign in life by Jesus Christ. Rom.
   v. 17.

   Now as the kingdom of God upon earth is to be considered with a leading
   view to this, so we sometimes find, that this glorious state of its
   members, or which will come much to the same thing, the society of the
   faithful in this glorious state, is, by way of eminence, called the
   kingdom of God: and with regard to this, they whose characters are such
   that they shall be excluded from thence, are represented as having no
   part in the kingdom of heaven, though they have been by profession
   members of the church of Christ on earth. Of this you have a remarkable
   instance, where our Lord says, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
   Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will
   of my Father which is in heaven: (Matt. vii. 21:) now it was calling
   Christ, Lord, or professing a regard to him as a divine teacher and
   governor, which was the very circumstance that distinguished the
   members of his kingdom on earth from the rest of mankind: yet as they
   who do this insincerely shall be excluded from final glory, it is said,
   they shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. So also the Apostle
   tells us, that flesh and blood, i. e. such gross machines of animal
   nature as those in which we now dwell, cannot inherit the kingdom of
   God; (2 Cor. xv. 50;) they cannot dwell in so pure a region; and
   therefore it is necessary, that before they enter upon it, those who
   are found alive at the illustrious day of Christ's appearance, should
   undergo a miraculous change to fit them for such an abode. In reference
   to this we are likewise told, that then, i. e. at the great
   resurrection-day, the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the
   kingdom of their Father. Matt. xiii. 43. And this is what our Lord most
   certainly had in view, when he tells the impenitent Jews, that there
   should be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when they should see Abraham,
   and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and
   they themselves thrust out; (Luke xiii. 29;) which could not be meant
   of the privileges of the Christian church upon earth, in which the
   patriarchs had no share; nor did the Jews at all envy those professing
   Christians, who most evidently had: it must undoubtedly therefore be
   numbered among those passages, in which the kingdom of God chiefly
   refers to the state of glory. And I apprehend, the text here before us
   may be added to that catalogue which leads us to show,

   2. What we are to understand by seeing the kingdom of God.

   Now, in general, you will easily apprehend, that to see the kingdom is
   to enjoy the blessings of it. There is no need of enumerating many
   passages of Scripture, where to see properly signifies to enjoy. This
   is apparently the sense of it, when Christ declares, Blessed are the
   pure in heart; for they shall see God: (Matt. v. 8:) for the Deity
   cannot be the object of sight; but the promise is, that such souls--Oh,
   that we may be in their number!--shall forever enjoy the most
   delightful communications from him. And thus again we are to understand
   it, where it is said, What man is he that desireth life, and loveth
   many days, that he may see, i. e. that he may enjoy, good? Psal. xxxiv.
   12. For otherwise, to see it without enjoying it, would be a great
   aggravation of misery and distress. And in this sense it is most
   evident, that seeing the kingdom of God must here be put, for enjoying
   the most important blessings appropriated to this state; because, as I
   have just been observing, condemned sinners are represented in another
   sense, as seeing that kingdom and the glorified saints in it; but
   viewing it only at an unapproachable distance, as a spectacle that
   fills them with horror and despair.

   This therefore is, upon the whole, the meaning of this passage: That no
   unregenerate soul shall finally have any part in the glory and
   happiness which Christ has prepared for his faithful subjects; nor can
   any that appear to be such, according to the tenor and constitution of
   the gospel, be admitted into the number even of professing Christians.
   It is true, indeed, a man may appear under such a disguise, that those
   who are in this sense the stewards of the mysteries of God, (1 Cor. iv.
   1,) may, in the judgment of charity, be obliged to think well of him,
   and to admit him; but Christ, who intimately knows him, does even now
   discern him. The present external privileges he enjoys, are such as he
   has no just right to; and in a little time, Christ will root him out of
   this kingdom with a vengeance, and he shall be openly declared a rebel,
   and one whom the Lord of it never knew, or never approved. Matt. vii.
   23. So that upon the whole, it is so little a part that he had in the
   kingdom, and that for so short a time, that it may, in the free
   language of Scripture, be said, that he has never seen the kingdom of
   God at all; that he has neither part nor lot in this matter, (Acts
   viii. 21,) has no part with God's chosen, nor any lot with his
   inheritance.

   Having thus largely explained the meaning of this phrase, I now
   proceed,

   II. To show you how CERTAIN this declaration of our Lord in the text
   is, or how absolutely impossible it is, that any unregenerate man
   should thus see the kingdom of God.

   Now this I shall argue, partly from the immutable constitution of God,
   whose kingdom it is: and partly from the nature of its blessings, which
   are such, that no unregenerate man, while he continues in that state,
   can have any fitness or capacity to enjoy them.

   The first of these considerations is copious and important enough, to
   furnish out abundant matter for the remainder of this discourse: and it
   will be difficult to dispatch it within these limits.

   1. The impossibility there is, that any unregenerate man should enter
   into the kingdom of God, appears from the IMMUTABLE CONSTITUTION of
   that God, whose kingdom it is.

   This might be sufficiently argued, from the express and emphatical
   words of our Lord Jesus Christ in the text. For he bore his Father's
   commission to preach the Gospel of the kingdom, to publish the good
   news of its erection and success, and likewise to declare its nature,
   and the method of admittance into it. And he is himself the great
   Sovereign of that kingdom; and consequently cannot but perfectly, and
   beyond all comparison with any other, know the whole of its
   constitution. But God has repeated the declaration by him, and by his
   other messengers to the children of men, in different ages, and under
   different dispensations, in such a manner as suited its infinite
   importance. And, therefore, for the further illustration of the
   argument, I shall enumerate a great variety of scriptures that speak
   the same language; not so much aiming therein at the speculative proof
   of the point, as attempting to impress the conscience of my hearers
   with a sense of its certainty; and humbly hoping that some of those
   sharp-pointed arrows, which I am now drawing out of the quiver of God,
   may, by the direction of his Spirit, enter the reins of some against
   whom they are leveled, (Lam. iii. 8,) and convince them of the absolute
   necessity of an entire change in their hearts, as well as their lives,
   or of the vanity of all those hopes which they entertain, while that
   change is wanting. And let me bespeak your attention, not to the
   conjectures or reasoning of a frail mortal man, but to the solemn
   admonitions and declarations of the eternal God; and be assured that in
   one sense or another, his word shall take hold on you, as it has done
   on sinners of former generations, either for conviction, or
   condemnation.

   That I may not be confounded in the multiplicity of my proofs, I shall
   range them under these three distinct heads. The prophets of the Old
   Testament were commissioned to make this declaration:--it was renewed
   by the preaching of Christ;--and was supported by the testimony of the
   Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

   The prophets of the Old Testament were commissioned in effect to make
   this declaration, that no unregenerate sinner should enter the kingdom
   of God.

   Well might our Lord say to Nicodemus, Art thou a teacher in Israel, and
   knowest not these things? For to this in effect all the prophets bear
   witness, and it might be learned from almost every page of their
   writings. It is true the particular phrase of being born again, or
   regenerated, does not occur there; nor is it expressly said, that an
   unregenerate man shall not be admitted into God's kingdom. But then the
   prophets everywhere assert, what is in effect the same, that no wicked
   man, who does not heartily repent of his sins, and turn from them to
   God, must expect the Divine favor. Now if you consider what we mean by
   an unregenerate man, according to the description I have given before,
   you will find it is just the same as an impenitent sinner; and if it be
   declared that such are not to expect the Divine favor, nay, that they
   must certainly prove the object of his displeasure, this must
   certainly. imply an exclusion from his kingdom, and must intend a great
   deal more than being deprived of everlasting happiness. And thus you
   see that all those scriptures, which speak of the irreconcilable hatred
   of God against sin, and against all impenitent sinners, come in to do
   service here, and are equivalent to the declaration in the text. And I
   may hereafter show you, that there are many scriptures in the Old
   Testament which lead men to consider that change, said to be so
   necessary, as what must be effected by a Divine operation on their
   souls. But as that will more properly come in under a following head, I
   shall at present content myself with selecting a few scriptures as a
   specimen of many hundred more, in proof of the main point before us:
   and I beseech you that you would endeavor to enter, not only into the
   sense, but into the spirit of them.

   You well know that unregenerate sinners are wicked men; and of such it
   is said, God is angry with the wicked every day; (Psal. vii. 2;) or all
   the day long, as the original imports. The sinner lies down and rises
   up, goes out and comes in, under the Divine displeasure: and though
   with great patience God bears with him for awhile, he is described as
   preparing his dreadful artillery against him, to smite him even with a
   mortal wound: so far will he be from admitting him into his kingdom,
   that, as it is there added, if he turn not he will whet his sword; he
   has bent his bow and made it ready; he has also prepared for him the
   instruments of death. Psal. vii. 12, 13. And in another place, he
   describes the dreadful consequence of that preparation in most lively
   terms: "If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on
   judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them
   that hate me: I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword
   shall devour flesh, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy;" i. e.
   as soon as I begin this awful work. Deut. xxxii. 41, 42. And elsewhere
   he compares the destruction which he will bring upon sinners at last,
   to that which he executed on Sodom and Gomorrah, when he scattered fire
   and brimstone on their habitations, and reduced their pleasant country
   to a burning lake; Upon the wicked he will rain snares, fire and
   brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this will be the portion of their
   cup: (Psal. xi. 6:) and oh, how unlike the state and abode of those who
   are the happy subjects of his kingdom!

   None of the prophets speak in milder and more gentle language to
   returning penitents than Isaiah; yet he declares, there is no peace,
   saith my God, to the wicked. Isa. lvii. 21. Yea, he does, as it were,
   call in the concurrence of all who feared God, and who loved their
   country, to echo back and enforce the admonition: say ye to the
   righteous, that it shall be well with him: but on the other hand, wo to
   the wicked! it shall be ill with him; for the reward of his hands shall
   be given him. Isa. iii. 10, 11.

   The enumeration would be endless; and it would require more than the
   time of a whole discourse, only to read over, without any comment or
   remark one half of the passages which might properly be introduced on
   this occasion. I will therefore only mention two more, which, though
   some of you may hear with indifference, I confess I cannot read without
   a very sensible inward commotion.

   The one is that passage in the Mosaic law, where God directs his
   servant to say, "If there be among you a root that beareth gall and
   wormwood, (i. e. any unregenerate soul,) who when he hears the words of
   this curse, shall bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have
   peace though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add
   drunkenness to thirst, (i. e. run into one debauchery and sin after
   another:) the Lord will not spare him, but the anger of the Lord, and
   his jealousy shall smoke against that man;---and the Lord shall
   separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to
   all the curses of the covenant, that are written in the book of the
   law." Deut. xxix. 18-21. There is a terrible emphasis of which we
   cannot but take notice here: God declares, that if among all the
   thousands of Israel, there was but one such presumptuous sinner, that
   thus flattered himself in the way of his own heart, he would make a
   terrible example of him, and separate that one man to evil, out of
   thousands and ten thousands of his faithful and obedient servants.

   This therefore is a passage full of apparent terror: the other is
   indeed a language of mercy; but it contains a most awful insinuation,
   which appears, as good Archbishop Tillotson expresses it, "like a razor
   set in oil, which wounds with so much the keener edge." As I live,
   saith the Lord God, 1 have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but
   that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your
   evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? (Ezek. xxxiii. 11;)
   thereby plainly intimating, that notwithstanding all that gentleness of
   the Divine nature, which he expresses in a most tender invitation,
   which he confirms even with the solemnity of an oath; yet, if sinners
   did not turn from their evil ways, there was no remedy, but they must
   die for it.

   And how, sirs, will any of you that continue in an unregenerate state,
   arm yourselves against these terrors? Is it by saying, 'that these are
   the thunders of Mount Sinai; that these are denunciations of the Old
   Testament; whereas the New speaks in milder language?' You may easily
   know the contrary.

   And to this purpose I am further to show you, that this declaration was
   renewed by the preaching of Christ.

   It is true, indeed, that grace and truth came by Jesus Christ: (John i.
   17:) yet all the grace and gentleness of that administration he
   brought, did not contradict those awful threatenings; nay, it obliged
   him to set them in a stronger light. He presently repeats to Nicodemus
   what he had just before asserted in the text, and declares, Verily,
   verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water, and of the
   Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God; (John iii. 5;) i. e.
   'As he must be baptized with water, in order to a regular entrance into
   the society of my people, so he must also be transformed by the
   cleansing and renewing influence of the Spirit, signified by the water
   there used, or he can have no part in the blessings which my Gospel
   brings.'

   And that this must produce a universal change in the life as well as
   the heart, and a faithful subjection to the will of God--without which
   no profession will stand a man in any stead--our Lord solemnly declares
   in the conclusion of his incomparable discourse on the Mount: "Not
   every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
   of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven:
   many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
   thy name, and in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name done many
   wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you:
   depart from me, ye that work iniquity." Matt. vii. 21, 22, 23.

   And shall you, sirs, merely for having a name and place in his house,
   escape; when those that have preached his Gospel, and wrought miracles
   in confirmation of it, when those that personally conversed with
   Christ, and those that ministered unto him shall perish, if destitute
   of a holy temper of heart, and of its solid fruit in their lives? Has
   not our Lord expressly said, that he will gather out of his kingdom all
   things that offend, and them that do iniquity; and will cast them into
   a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth? Matt.
   xiii. 41, 42. Nay, in his infinite compassion, he has given to sinners,
   as it were, a copy of the sentence that will another day be pronounced
   upon them; that they may meditate upon it, and review it, and judge
   whether they can bear the terror of its execution. Hear it attentively,
   and then say whether unregenerate sinners shall enter into his kingdom.
   The dreadful doom is this: Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
   fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. Matt. xxv. 41. And what
   now will you say to this? Can any soul of you imagine, that the Lord
   Jesus Christ did not know what would pass in this day in which he is
   appointed to preside? or that knowing it, and knowing it would be
   something different from this, he would, on any consideration
   whatsoever, make a false representation, and lay so much stress upon
   it? Yet one or other of these things you must secretly imagine; or must
   own, that every unregenerate sinner, and you among the rest, must not
   only be excluded from his presence, but be condemned to suffer all the
   fury of his wrath, in company with devils and damned spirits, in final
   darkness, and everlasting burning.

   It only remains that I show you, that the same testimony was renewed by
   the Apostles, under the influence of the Holy Spirit.

   You know that they were authorised by their Great Master to declare, in
   an authentic manner, the constitution of his kingdom; and that he who
   despises them, despises Christ. Luke x. 16. Now I would fain persuade
   you all, to consider this argument as it lies in Scripture; to read
   over the epistolary parts of the New Testament in this view, to observe
   what encouragement they any of them give to an unregenerate sinner, to
   expect any part in the kingdom of heaven. In the mean time, permit me
   to present you with a few texts, as a specimen of the rest.

   The apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Romans, does indeed speak of
   God's justifying the ungodly; (Rom. iv. 5;) but lest any should vainly
   imagine that he encourages the hope of those that continue so, he
   expressly tells us, in the very same epistle, that the wrath of God is
   revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men; (Rom. ii. 8;) and that ere long this wrath shall be executed, even
   in the day of the more ample revelation of the righteous judgment of
   God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: To them that
   do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, which is the character
   of every unregenerate sinner, indignation and wrath: tribulation and
   anguish upon every soul of man that doth evil, of the Jew first, as
   having had the most signal advantages, though advantages inferior to
   yours, and also of the Gentile. Rom. ii. 5, 6, 8, 9. And farther he
   assures us, that to be carnally minded is death: and that the carnal
   mind, which universally prevails in men, till by regenerating grace
   they are made spiritual, is enmity against God; for it is not subject
   to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Rom. viii. 6, 7.

   In another epistle he mentions it as a first principle, in which it
   might rationally be supposed, no Christian was uninstructed. Know ye
   not, says he, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
   God? 1 Cor. vi. 9. And elsewhere he declares, that all external modes
   of religion, separate from that entire change of soul which I have
   described, are worthless and vain. In Christ Jesus, says he, or to
   those that desire any part in him and his kingdom, neither circumcision
   availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. Gal. vi. 15.
   He likewise tells us to this purpose in another place, that his grace,
   which has appeared unto all men, teaches us to deny "ungodliness and
   worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this
   present world;" (Tit. ii. 11, 12;) and yet, after all, to acknowledge,
   that it is "not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saves us, by the washing of regeneration, and
   the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he has shed on us abundantly
   through Jesus Christ our Saviour." Tit. iii. 5, 6. And without
   holiness, which is the effect of these sacred operations upon the soul,
   he expressly tells us in another place, that no man shall see the Lord.
   Heb. xii. 14. And to allege but one more passage from him: as it is
   evident, that all unregenerate sinners, and only they are ignorant of
   God, and disobedient to the Gospel; he solemnly assures us, that
   instead of receiving such at last into his kingdom, the Lord Jesus
   shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire,
   taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
   Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting
   destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his
   power. (2 Thes. i. 7, 8, 9. This is the testimony of the apostle Paul
   in his own emphatical words, zealous as he was for the doctrine of free
   grace, which such declarations as these do not in the least degree
   contradict.

   Let us now hear his brethren, the other apostles of the Lord. James
   urges sinners, if they ever desire to draw nigh to God, and to have him
   draw nigh to them, to cleanse their hands, and purify their hearts.
   James iv. 8. And yet more expressly he says when he speaks of those who
   should receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
   that love him; of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that
   we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures. Jam. i. 12, 18.
   The apostle Peter describes Christians, as those whose souls were
   purified in obeying the truth through the Spirit-being born again, not
   of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible; (1 Pet. i. 22, 23;) and as
   those who were made partakers of the Divine Nature, having escaped the
   corruption that is in the world through lust. 2 Pet. i. 4. Again, John,
   the beloved disciple, tells us, that every one that doth righteousness
   is born of God; (1 John ii. 29;) but he that committeth sin is of the
   devil; (1 John iii. 8;) and that every one that has a well grounded
   hope of being like Christ, and seeing him as he is when he appears,
   purifies himself, even as he is pure. 1 John iii. 2, 3. And once more,
   the apostle Jude, as he describes those who are sensual and have not
   the Spirit, as men, that if they were saved at all, must be plucked out
   of the fire; (Jude ver. 19, 23;) so he echoes back that awful prophecy,
   which Enoch had so long since delivered, that the Lord will come with
   ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to
   convict all that are ungodly, of all those ungodly deeds and works, by
   which they have violated his law. Jude ver. 14, 15.

   This then appears, from the whole tenor of the Scriptures, to be the
   positive and immutable constitution of the great God--that none who are
   unregenerate shall be admitted to enjoy the happiness of heaven.

   And from the view that we have taken of the sacred writings it is
   manifest, that this, in every age, has been the language of the word of
   God; and under every dispensation we have sufficient evidence of this
   important truth. This is the doctrine of the Old Testament; and many
   are the passages that I have offered from the law of Moses, and from
   the Prophets, and the Psalms, that show it is impossible an unrenewed
   soul should enter into heaven. And the same also is asserted in the
   strongest terms in the New Testament; and when Christ came to set the
   Gospel of the kingdom in a clearer light, the purport of the
   declaration that he makes to Nicodemus in the text, was frequently
   repeated by him in the course of his preaching, and represented as the
   rule he would regard at the last day. And the inspired apostles speak
   the same thing with a united voice, and testify at large in their
   epistles, that it is absolutely necessary we should be born again, if
   ever we would hope to see the kingdom of God.

   So that now, sirs, I may say, Call, if there be any that will answer;
   and to which of the saints will you turn, (Job v. 1,) to encourage your
   vain and presumptuous hope, of finding your lot among God's people in
   the kingdom of glory, if you are strangers to that important and
   universal change, which we before described as regeneration in the
   Scripture sense of the word? The prophets under the Old Testament, and
   Christ and his apostles under the New, concur, in all the variety of
   the most awful language, to expose so presumptuous a hope. And is it
   not audacious madness in any to venture their souls upon it? Thus you
   would undoubtedly judge of any man who should strike a dagger into his
   breast, or discharge a pistol at his head, on this presumption, that
   the almighty power of God could prevent his death, though the heart or
   the brain were pierced.

   But it is much greater folly for a man, while he continues in an
   unregenerate state, to promise himself a part in the kingdom of heaven.
   For though there would be no reason in the world to expect a miraculous
   interposition, to save a life which a man was so resolutely bent to
   destroy; yet none can say, that such an interposition would contradict
   any of the express engagements of God's word; whereas to admit an
   unregenerate sinner into the regions of glory, would be violating, not
   this, or that single declaration, but the whole series and tenor of it;
   and we shall farther show, in the next Discourse, that it would also
   be, in effect, altering the very nature of the heavenly kingdom itself,
   as well as its constitution. Now what hope can be more desperate, than
   that which can have no support, but in the subversion of the Redeemer's
   kingdom, and even of the eternal throne of God, the foundations of
   which are righteousness and truth!
     __________________________________________________________________

DISCOURSE V.

  OF THE INCAPACITY OF AN UNREGENERATE PERSON FOR RELISHING THE ENJOYMENTS OF
  THE HEAVENLY WORLD.

  John iii. 3.

   --Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.

   IN order to demonstrate the necessity of regeneration, of which I would
   fain convince not only your understandings, but your consciences, I am
   now proving to you, that without it, it is impossible to enter into the
   kingdom of God; and how weighty a consideration that is I am afterwards
   to represent.

   That it is thus impossible, the words in the text do indeed
   sufficiently prove: but for the further illustration of the subject, I
   have proposed to consider it under two distinct views.

   I have already shown it is impossible, because the constitution of the
   kingdom of heaven is such, that God has solemnly declared, and this
   under different dispensations, and more or less plainly in all ages of
   his church, that no unregenerate person, i. e. no impenitent sinner,
   shall have any part in it. And I am now further to show,

   That the nature of the future happiness, which is here chiefly
   signified by the kingdom of God, is such, that an unregenerate person
   would be incapable of relishing it, even upon a supposition of his
   being admitted into it.

   This is a thought of so great importance, and so seldom represented in
   its full strength, that I shall at present confine my discourse
   entirely to it.

   I know, sinners, it will be one of the most difficult things in the
   world, to bring you to a serious persuasion of this truth. You think
   heaven is so lovely, and so glorious a place, that if you could
   possibly get an admittance there, you should certainly be happy. But I
   would now set myself, if possible, to convince you that this is a rash
   and ill-grounded persuasion; and that on the contrary, if you were now
   in the regions of glory, and in the society of those blessed
   inhabitants, that unrenewed nature and unsanctified heart of yours,
   would give you a disrelish for all the sublimest entertainments of that
   blissful place, and turn heaven itself into a kind of hell to you.

   Now for the demonstration of this, it is only necessary for you
   seriously to consider what kind of happiness that of heaven is, as it
   is represented to us in the word of God; for from thence undoubtedly we
   are to take our notions of it.

   You might to be sure sit down and imagine a happiness to yourselves,
   which would perfectly suit your degenerate taste; a happiness, which
   the more entirely you were enslaved to flesh and sense, the more
   exquisitely you would be able to enter into it. If God would assign you
   a region in that beautiful world, where you should dwell in fine houses
   magnificently furnished, and gaily adorned; where the most harmonious
   music should soothe your ear, and the most delicious food and generous
   wines in a rich variety should regale your taste: if he should give you
   a splendid retinue of people, to caress and attend you, offering you
   their humblest services, and acknowledging the most servile dependence
   upon your favor: especially if with all this he should furnish you with
   a set of companions just of your own temper and disposition, with whom
   you might spend what proportion of time you pleased, in gaming and
   jollity, in riot and debauchery, without any interruption from the
   reproof, or even the example of the children of God, or from
   indispositions of body, or remorse of conscience: this you would be
   ready to call life and happiness indeed: and if the great Disposer of
   all things were but to add perpetuity to such a situation, you would
   not envy persons of a more refined taste the heaven you lost, for such
   a Paradise as this.

   Such indeed was the happiness which Mahomet promised to his followers:
   flowery shades and gay dresses, luxurious fare and beautiful women, are
   described with all the pomp of language in almost every page of his
   Alcoran, as the glorious and charming rewards which were to be bestowed
   on the faithful after the resurrection. And if this were the felicity
   which the Gospel promised, extortioners and idolators, whoremongers and
   drunkards, would be much fitter to inherit the kingdom of God, than the
   most pious and mortified saints that ever appeared on earth. But here,
   as almost everywhere else, the Bible and the Alcoran speak a very
   different language; and far from leading us into such gross and sensual
   expectations, our Lord Jesus Christ has told us that the children of
   the resurrection neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are like
   the angels of God in heaven, (Matt. xxii. 30,) and enjoy such pure and
   spiritual delights, as are suited to such holy and excellent creatures.

   It is true that in the book of Revelations, stately palaces and shining
   habits, delicious fruit and harmonious music are all mentioned, as
   contributing to the happiness of those, who have the honor to inhabit
   the New Jerusalem. But then the style of that obscure and prophetical
   book naturally leads us to consider these merely as figurative phrases,
   which are made use of to express the happiness that Divine wisdom and
   love has prepared for the righteous, in a manner accommodated to the
   weakness of our conceptions; or at least, if in any of these respects
   provision be made for the entertainment of a glorified body, whatever
   its methods of sensation and perception will be, all will be temperate
   and regular; and after all, this is even there represented but as the
   least considerable part of our happiness, the height of which is made
   to consist in the most elevated strains of devotion, and in an entire
   and everlasting devotedness to the service of God and of the Lamb.

   Let us therefore immediately proceed to settle the point in question,
   by a more particular survey of the several branches of the celestial
   felicity, as represented to us in the word of God; and from thence it
   will undeniably appear, that were an unregenerate soul in the same
   place with the blessed, and surrounded with the same external
   circumstances, the temper of the mind would not by any means allow him
   to participate of their happiness. For it is plain the Scripture
   represents the happiness of heaven as consisting,---in the perfection
   of our minds in knowledge and holiness;---in the sight and service of
   the ever blessed God,---in beholding the glory of our exalted
   Redeemer;---and enjoying the society of glorious angels and perfected
   saints,---throughout an endless eternity. Now, sinners, it is
   impossible you should enter into any such delights as these, while you
   continue in an unregenerate state.

   1. One very considerable part of the happiness of heaven consists in
   that perfection of knowledge and holiness to which the blessed shall be
   there exalted; but in which the unregenerate soul can have no pleasure.

   Thus we are told, that the spirits of just men shall there be made
   perfect; (Heb. xiii. 23;) for nothing that defiles, as every degree of
   moral imperfection does, shall enter into the New Jerusalem. Rev. xxi.
   27. An Old Testament saint conceived of future happiness, as consisting
   in being satisfied with the likeness of God: (Psal. xvii. 15;) a
   character that is manifestly most agreeable to the view of it, which
   the beloved disciple gives us, where he says, that when Christ shall
   appear, we shall be tike him, for we shall see him as he is; (1 John
   iii. 2;) which must certainly refer to the glories of the mind, which
   are of infinitely greater importance than the highest imaginable beauty
   and ornament, that can be put upon the corporeal part of our nature in
   its most illustrious state.

   Now from this perfection and holiness, which shall then be wrought in
   the soul, there will naturally arise an unspeakable complacency and
   joy, something resembling that which the blessed God himself possesses,
   in the survey of the infinite and unspotted rectitude of his own most
   holy nature. And in proportion to the degree, in which the eyes of our
   understandings are enlightened to discern wherein true excellency
   consists, will the soul be delighted in the consciousness of such
   considerable degrees of it in itself.

   But surely it will be superfluous for me to undertake to demonstrate,
   that an unregenerate soul can have no part in this divine pleasure,
   which implies the complete renewal of the mind as its very foundation.
   For to imagine that he might, would be supposing him regenerate and
   unregenerate at the same time. As Mr. Baxter very well expresses it,
   "The happiness of heaven is holiness; and to talk of being happy
   without it is as apparent nonsense, as to talk of being well without
   health, or being saved without salvation."

   I would only add on this head, that the highest improvement of our
   intellectual faculties could not make us happy, without such a change
   in the affections and the will, as I have before described under the
   former general head. For the more clear and distinct the knowledge of
   true excellence and perfection is, the greater would be your anguish
   and horror, to see and feel yourselves entirely destitute of it; and it
   is exceedingly probable that spirits of the most elevated genius have
   the keenest sensation of that infamy and misery, which is inseparable
   from the prevalence of sinful dispositions in such minds as these.

   2. Another very considerable branch of the celestial happiness, is that
   which arises, from the contemplation and enjoyment of the ever blessed
   God; but of this likewise an unregenerate sinner is incapable.

   As our own reason assures us, that God is the greatest and best of
   beings, and the most deserving object of our inquiries and regards, one
   would think it would naturally lead us to imagine, that the perfection
   and happiness of the human soul consists in the knowledge and enjoyment
   of him; and that when it arrives at the seat of complete felicity, it
   must intimately know him, and converse with him. And in this view, I
   have sometimes been surprised, that men of such distinguished
   abilities, as some of the heathen poet, and philosophers appear to have
   been, should have had no greater regard to the Supreme Being in the
   description which they give us of the future happiness. That sort of
   friendship for them, which an acquaintance with their writings must
   give to a person of any relish for the beauties of composition, makes
   one almost unwilling to expose the low and despicable ideas, which they
   often give of the state of their greatest heroes in the regions of
   immortality. But the word of God speaks a very different language. Our
   Lord represents the rewards to be bestowed on the pure in heart, by
   telling us that they shall see, i. e. contemplate and enjoy God; (Matt.
   v. 8;) and virtuous souls who overcome the temptations with which they
   are here surrounded, shall be made as pillars in the house of their
   God, and shall go no more out: (Rev. iii. 12;) and it is elsewhere said
   that his servants shall serve him, and shall see his face. Rev. xxii.
   3, 4. And David's views under a darker dispensation rose to such a
   degree of refinement, as to say, As for me, I shall behold thy face in
   righteousness; (Psal. xvii. 1;) which he mentions as a felicity
   infinitely superior to all the delights of the most prosperous sinner.

   But now, sinners, it is utterly impossible that while you continue in
   an unregenerate state, you should behold the face of God with pleasure.
   The unutterable delight which the blessed inhabitants of heaven find in
   it, arises not merely from the abstract ideas of his essential
   perfections, but from a sense of his favor and love to them. It is this
   that gives a relish to the whole survey, and rejoices the heart of all
   the saints, both in heaven and on earth. He is a God of awful majesty
   and irresistible power, of infinite wisdom and unspotted holiness, of
   unerring justice, invariable fidelity, and inexhaustible goodness; and
   this God is our God; he will be our guide and our portion forever.
   Psal. xlviii. 14; lxxiii. 26. And were it not for this view, let a
   creature think of God with ever so much spirit and propriety, he must
   think of him, and be troubled; (Psal. lxxvii. 3;) yea, he must be
   filled with unutterable horror and confusion, as the devil is at the
   thought of an infinitely perfect Being, in whom he has no interest,
   from whom he has nothing friendly to expect; and if nothing friendly,
   then everything dreadful.

   Now it is certain, sinners, that while you continue in an unregenerate
   state, under the influence of that carnal mind which is enmity against
   God, (Rom. viii. 7,) and full of unconquerable rebellion against his
   law, there can be no foundation for a friendship between him and your
   souls; nor for any persuasion, or any apprehension of your interest in
   his favor and love. Friendship, you know, supposes something of a
   similitude of nature and sentiment; for as God himself argues, how can
   two walk together except they be agreed? Amos iii. 3. Now I have before
   observed to you at large, that God being of purer eyes than to behold
   evil, (Heb. i. 13,) must necessarily hate all the workers of iniquity;
   the foolish therefore shall not stand in his sight, (Psal. v. 5,) or
   shall not be admitted to such a situation: nor would they indeed be
   able to endure it. Let conscience judge what satisfaction you could
   find in the presence of a God, that you knew scorned and hated you,
   even while he suffered you to continue among the crowd of his children
   and servants. The more lively ideas you had of the beauty and
   perfection of the Divine nature, the more you must loathe yourselves
   for being so unlike him, and so abominable to him: and what pleasure do
   you think consistent with such self-contempt and abhorrence? Or rather,
   would not the wretched degeneracy of your nature lead you another way;
   and a kind of unconquerable self-love, joined even with this
   consciousness of deformity and vileness, lead you to hate God himself?
   It is described as the fatal effect of prevailing wickedness in the
   heart, my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me. Zechariah
   xi. 8. And thus would it probably work in you, and produce in your
   wretched breasts a mortal hatred against him, and an envious rage at
   the thought of his perfect happiness; a state of mind, of all others
   that can be imagined, the most odious, and the most tormenting.

   How, sirs, could your hearts, possessed with these diabolical passions,
   bear to see the beams of his glory surrounding you on every side? How
   could you bear to hear the songs and adorations, that were continually
   addressed to his throne; and to observe the humble attendance of all
   the hosts of heaven about it, who perpetually reckon it their honor and
   happiness to be employed in obedience to his commands? Such a sight of
   the glory and felicity of your Divine Enemy would make you, so far as
   your limited nature was capable of it, miserable even in proportion to
   the degree in which he is happy. This was, no doubt, the torment of the
   devils as soon as they had harbored a thought of hostility against God;
   and the remembrance of that glory in which they once saw him, and which
   they know he still invariably possesses, is surely an everlasting
   vexation to them: and it would be so to you, if you were within the
   sight of it.

   But further, the blessed in heaven find their everlasting entertainment
   in the service of God. They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy,
   holy, Lord God Almighty; (Rev. iv. 8;) i. e. they are continually
   employed, either in the immediate acts of devotion, or in other
   services, in which they still maintain a devotional temper, and are
   breathing out their souls in holy affections, while their active powers
   are employed in the execution of his commands. But as I have already
   shown you, that while in an unregenerate state you could have no sense
   of his favor to you, it is very apparent, that you could have no
   sentiments of gratitude and love towards him. So that while angels and
   glorified saints were breathing out their souls in the most delightful
   and rapturous praises, you must keep a sullen silence; or, if it were
   possible that your harps and voices should sound as melodiously as
   theirs, it would be all ceremony and show; the music of the heart would
   be wanting; and you would look on all the external forms of service but
   as a tedious task, and count it your misfortune, that the customs of
   the place obliged you to attend them.

   You may the more easily apprehend and believe this when you consider
   what little relish you now have for those solemnities of Divine
   worship, in which sincere Christians have the most lively foretaste of
   heaven. You know, in your own consciences, that short and interrupted
   as our public services are, they are the burden of your lives. You know
   that you say, in your hearts at least, When will the Sabbath be past,
   and the new moon be gone? Amos viii. Judge then how insupportable it
   would be to you, to spend an everlasting Sabbath thus. I question not,
   but to your wretched spirits annihilation would appear vastly
   preferable to an eternal existence so employed.

   3. Another very considerable branch of the happiness of heaven, is that
   which arises from the sight of the glory of an exalted Redeemer; but
   for this likewise no unconverted sinner can have any relish.

   This is a view of the future happiness, which our Lord gives us, when
   he prays for his people in those memorable words, engraven, as I hope,
   upon many of our hearts; Father, I will that they whom thou hast given
   me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou
   hast given me. John xvii. 24. And he elsewhere promises it, as the
   great reward he would bestow upon his people; If any man serve me, let
   him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my servant be. John
   xii. 26. And agreeably to this, the apostle Paul represents it as the
   transporting view in which he considered the happiness of the future
   world; I desire, says he, to depart and be with Christ; which is far
   better; (Phil. i. 28;) incomparably beyond any of the enjoyments of the
   present world which can come into competition with it. But for this
   part of the happiness of angels, and of the spirits of just men made
   perfect, it is also evident, that you, sinners, can have no relish.

   The sight of Christ will afford holy souls a transporting delight,
   because they will regard it as the glory of their Redeemer and their
   Friend, and as a pledge and security of their own glory. But what
   foundation can you, sinners, find for such a joyful sympathy with
   Christ, and such a comfortable conclusion with regard to yourselves?
   Such is the wretched degeneracy of your nature, that though Christ be
   indeed the chiefest among ten thousand, and altogether lovely, (Cant.
   v. 10, 16.) being the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express
   image of his person, (Heb. i. 3,) possessed of every divine perfection
   and excellence; yet you now slight and neglect him, and discern in him
   no form or comeliness, for which he is to be desired: (Isa. liii. 2:)
   and were you unregenerate in heaven, the same principle would prevail.
   Now where there is no love to a person, there can be no delight in his
   converse, nor any pleasure in his happiness. Nay, the contrariety of
   your nature to his would rather occasion aversion and terror. You could
   not but know, that the blessed Jesus is holy and undefiled, and
   separate from sinners; (Heb. vii. 26;) that he abhors all moral evil to
   such a degree, that he laid aside all the glory and entertainments of
   heaven, that he might destroy the interest of sin in this world of
   ours, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works: (Tit. ii. 14:) and when you should recollect at the same time
   that sinfulness that continued to reign in your hearts, and made you to
   every good work reprobate, (Tit. i. 16,) you could not but know that
   you must be hateful to him; and therefore could not but fear, lest his
   almighty power should be exercised for your punishment and destruction:
   and thus your terror must rise, in proportion to the sensible evidence
   you had of his dignity and authority. In a word, you would stand like
   guilty rebels in the presence-chamber of their injured and displeased
   Sovereign: his throne. and his sceptre, his robe and his crown, his
   courtiers and his guards, though in themselves splendid and magnificent
   objects, only serve to terrify and amaze them, while they display the
   grandeur and power of their enemy.

   4. Another very considerable branch of the celestial happiness will be
   the society of angels and glorified saints; but for this likewise an
   unregenerate sinner must be unfit.

   You know that when the apostle speaks of our alliance to the heavenly
   world, he represents it as a social state; where excellent spirits
   dwell together, and converse with each other with mutual esteem and
   endearment: ye are come, says he, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
   innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of
   the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to the spirits of just
   men made perfect. Heb. xii. 22, 23. It is sitting down with Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob, with all the patriarchs and prophets, all the
   apostles and martyrs in the kingdom of heaven: (Matt. viii. 11:) and
   perhaps you think you shall want nothing more to complete your
   happiness, than to be admitted to a place among them. But reflect a
   little more attentively upon the circumstances of things, and I am
   persuaded you will form a different judgment.

   There is no reason to doubt, but that at your first entrance into the
   regions of glory you would be agreeably struck with the view of those
   inhabitants. As for those beauties of their character, which consist in
   love to God, and in zeal for his honor and interest, it is certain,
   that you would be insensible of them, and pay but little regard to
   them: but the humanity and benevolence of their temper would, no doubt,
   render them agreeable to you; and so much the more, as self-love might
   lead you to expect some personal advantage by it. And it is more than
   possible, that you would be much prejudiced in their favor by those
   resplendent and attractive forms in which they appear; forms, no doubt,
   far more beautiful and engaging than any which the children of men ever
   saw upon earth. On both these accounts it might be natural enough for
   you, at first, to address them with an air of respect, as persons that
   you could be glad to be upon good terms with, and in whose friendship
   you could desire a share.

   But how do you think that any such proposal of friendship would be
   received by an angel, or a glorified saint? No doubt, if there were any
   prospect of converting you, or any hope you might be brought to a
   devout and holy temper, they would immediately become preachers of
   righteousness to you; and endeavor by the most rational, the most
   pathetic, and the most insinuating address, to awaken and charm you to
   a sense of religion, and so to form you to a capacity for happiness.
   But they would know, that according to the eternal constitution of God,
   there could be no room to entertain such a hope; but that being filthy,
   you must be filthy still: (Rev. xxii. 11:) and therefore, as they would
   know you to be incorrigible, their love to God, and their concern to be
   approved and accepted by him, would prevent their forming any intimate
   friendship with persons whose natures were so contrary to him, and on
   whom he looked with such irreconcilable abhorrence. And besides this,
   their own personal sanctity of character would give them an aversion to
   such corrupt and degenerate creatures: so that how much soever they
   might pity your condition, they would turn away from you, as objects
   whose presence and converse were not to be endured.

   And do you not easily apprehend, that such a refusal on their part
   would be both shameful and very provoking to you? For which way could
   you bear it, to be thus rejected and dishonored by the most excellent
   part of the creation; by those whom perhaps you once intimately knew,
   and with whom you conversed upon equal terms; nay, by many who were
   once much your inferiors, and whom, perhaps, in the pride of your
   hearts, you would not condescend to regard? The natural effect of this
   must surely be, that you would soon be proportionably displeased and
   enraged with the refusal, as you were at first charmed at their
   appearance; and when you saw that transporting pleasure which they took
   in the affection and friendship of each other, and the joy which the
   Divine favor poured into their souls, while you, in the very same
   place, were excluded from these rich entertainments, your hearts would
   soon burn with envy and indignation; and as much as you before admired
   them, you, upon this, would come to hate them. And, perhaps, that
   hatred would put you upon some attempt to interrupt, or even, if it
   were possible, to destroy that happiness which you were not allowed to
   share. But, then, when you saw them continually under the Divine
   protection, and compassed with his favor as with a shield, (Psalm v.
   12,) so that your malice could not reach them, all the keenness and
   rancor of your spirit would recoil upon itself; you would fly from
   their presence, as insupportable; and would be glad to retire to some
   meaner apartment, or to hide yourselves in the shades of darkness; so
   that you might but get rid of the sight of so many dazzling objects,
   whose lustre, instead of cheering your vitiated eye, would pain and
   overpower it.

   But if you should not be transported to this diabolical excess--if it
   were possible for you to behold the glorified saints, and to live among
   them, without these envious and tormenting passions; yet surely you
   would want a relish for the most entertaining part of their
   conversation. Had you indeed a good natural genius, which to be sure
   many unconverted sinners have, it might be very agreeable to hear them
   discoursing of the wonders of nature; and that curiosity, which is in
   some measure incident even to persons of the meanest capacities, would
   make it pleasant to hear them recount the important history relating to
   the revolutions of the angelic world, which we on this earth are
   entirely strangers to, or at least have been very little acquainted
   with them. But surely the most delightful topics of conversation, which
   heaven itself can furnish out, must be those which are religious and
   divine; the infinite perfections of the ever blessed God; the personal
   glories and incomparable love of his condescending, but exalted Son;
   and the sanctifying operations of the blessed Spirit on the soul,
   transforming it into the Divine Image, and making it meet for eternal
   glory. Yes, even when the blessed spirits above are handling
   philosophical or historical subjects, they still consider them with a
   regard to God, as his perfections are displayed and illustrated in the
   works of his hands, and in the conduct of his providence. And here
   their pleasure flows, not merely from a set of rational ideas, which
   arise in their own minds, or are suggested to them by others: but from
   the exercise of those devout affections upon the blessed God, which are
   correspondent to these several subjects of discourse.

   And can you, sirs, who are alienated from the divine life, (Eph. iv.
   18,) and accustomed to live in a continual neglect and forgetfulness of
   the Great Parent of universal nature, can you relish such subjects as
   these? You would, no doubt, be discontented and uneasy in such a scene:
   the heavenly oratory of this holy society would have no charms for you;
   but you would be longing for some of those vain and worthless
   companions, whom you were so fond of here upon earth, to hear a merry
   story, or a song, or to join with them in the pleasures of a debauch.

   5. Another considerable branch of the happiness of heaven arises from
   the assured prospect of the everlasting continuance of this felicity;
   but, if an unregenerate soul could find any entertainment at all in
   heaven, he certainly could have no ground for such an expectation of
   its continuance.

   When the children of God on earth think of the happiness of heaven, the
   eternity of it makes a very deep impression on their hearts, and even
   swallows up their souls with ardent desire and unutterable joy: it
   raises their esteem, and animates their hope, while they reflect on
   that exceeding and eternal weight of glory, (2 Cor. iv. 17,) that house
   not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, (2 Cor. v. 1,) and that
   inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and which fadeth not away. 1
   Pet. i. 4. And no doubt that the blessed in heaven regard it in the
   same view, and all the pleasures they enjoy are vastly increased by the
   prospect of their endless duration; so that by the anticipation of an
   eternity still to come, they do, as it were, every moment enjoy an
   infinite satisfaction. But as for you, sinners, while you are so ill
   attempered to the happiness of heaven, the prospect of an eternal abode
   there would not, on the principles I have laid down above, be a
   prospect of eternal happiness, but rather, on the whole, of eternal
   uneasiness to you.

   But suffer me a little to discourse upon another supposition; and let
   me now, for argument sake, waive what I have been so long insisting
   upon, and suppose, that you could so far command the turbulent passions
   of your own heart, and so unite, as it were, the whole powers of your
   soul, to attend to the beauty of place, the harmony of music, and
   whatever else may be supposed capable of regaling the senses or the
   imagination, as upon the whole, to find heaven a pleasing and
   delightful abode, and to wish, that though some of its entertainments
   were above your taste and capacity, yet you might be allowed an eternal
   enjoyment of the rest; could there be any room for you to expect a
   perpetual abode in these blissful seats? No, sinners, you would not be
   able so much as to hope it. The good itself is so great, and perpetual
   enjoyment, even in any degree, has such a kind of infinite value, that
   I know not how the purest and noblest spirits in heaven could
   absolutely have been secure of it, separate from the engagement of a
   Divine promise.

   And what Divine promise would you be able to have recourse to in such a
   circumstance as we now suppose? Where could you find it in all the book
   of God, that persons of your character should ever enter into heaven at
   all, much less that you should forever continue there? You could have
   therefore no security of the continuance of your abode in heaven, if it
   were possible that you should enter on the possession of it: but when
   you should consider the unsullied holiness of the ever blessed God, the
   sovereign of this sacred province, and the spotless purity of that
   gracious Redeemer, to whom the government of it is committed, you could
   not but fear, that you should quickly be seized by the hand of
   vengeance, be hurled from the battlements of heaven, and plunged low
   into the pit of destruction. You know this was the condemnation of the
   rebel angels, and your guilt, compared with that dreadful event, which
   makes so considerable a scene of the history of heaven, would, I doubt
   not, be sufficient to create everlasting jealousy and uneasiness, and
   to turn every pleasurable circumstance into a source of horror, in the
   apprehensions of being deprived eternally of it.

   Thus you see, sirs, from a particular survey of the various lights in
   which heaven is represented, and of the various branches of which its
   happiness consists, an unregenerate sinner is incapable of it, even
   though we would suppose that he was actually admitted to it. Let me
   entreat you to reflect on all these things, and you will see the
   reasonableness of that one remark with which I shall conclude this
   discourse, viz.:

   How vain are all those hopes of heaven, which in your present condition
   you are ready to entertain!

   I have been proving at large, that if God were to admit you to the
   possession of heaven, which it is certain he never will, you would be
   incapable of relishing the enjoyment of it: nay, that there would be a
   solid foundation in your own hearts, for many of the most tumultuous
   and disquieting passions. Envy and grief, fear and rage, those roots of
   bitterness, would spring up even in the Paradise of God, and turn the
   fertility of that blessed soil into their own nourishment. And do you
   imagine that any external accommodations or ornaments could make you
   easy and comfortable, under the transports of such hellish passions?
   What if you were to take a man that was tormented with a violent fit of
   the stone or gout, and to place him in a most delicious garden, or in a
   palace of marble and cedar, to set him on a throne of gold under a
   canopy of purple, to clothe him with robes of velvet and embroidery,
   regaling him with the most delicious fruits and generous wines, and at
   the same time soothing his ear with all the harmony of sound, which the
   most melodious symphony of instruments and voices could afford? Would
   all this magnificence and luxury make him insensible of that anguish
   which was racking his very vitals? or would not that inward torture
   rather render him insensible of this association of pleasurable
   impressions from without? Yea, would it not incline him to suspect,
   that you intended all these pompous preparations only to deride and
   insult him?' As little would your distempered and unholy souls be
   capable of relishing the entertainments of heaven, while these
   entertainments and these souls of yours, continue what they are at
   present.

   There must be therefore a change: and will you consider where that
   change must be made? If you continue still in your present character
   and circumstances, there must be a vast change in heaven itself, before
   you can be happy in it. The whole temper, character, and disposition of
   every saint and angel there, must be changed from what it now is,
   before they can be capable of any friendly and complacential
   conversation with you. Yea, our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the same
   yesterday, to-day, and forever, (Heb. xiii. 9,) must divest himself of
   those beauties of holiness, which are infinitely dearer to him than any
   external grandeur or authority, before he can receive you into his
   kingdom. Nay, the very Father of lights, with whom there is no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning, (Jam. i. 17,) must be entirely
   changed. He must lay aside that holiness which is essential to his
   nature, and which is the brightness and glory of it: he must love that
   which he now hates, and be indifferent to that which he most
   affectionately loves, before he can open his arms to you, and smile
   upon your souls. And can you dare to hope for such an unaccountable,
   such an inconceivable revolution as this? No, sirs, infinitely sooner
   would God change earth into hell, and bury you, and all of your
   character, under the ruins of this world, which you inhabit and
   pollute, than he would thus tarnish the beauties of heaven, and divest
   himself of the brightest glory of his own divinity. "God," says
   Archbishop Tillotson, "has condescended to take our nature upon him,
   that he might make us capable of happiness; but if this will not do, he
   will not put off his own nature to make us happy."

   What then do you imagine? Do you think that God will prepare some
   separate apartments in heaven, furnished with a variety of sensual
   pleasures, for the entertainment of persons of your character? some
   apartments from whence the tokens of his presence shall be withdrawn,
   from whence the exercise of his worship shall be banished, from whence
   saints and angels shall retire to make way for those inhabitants, who,
   like you, have sinned themselves beyond a capacity of enjoying God, or
   of being fit companions for any of his most excellent creatures? This
   were to suppose the Christian religion false, and to contradict the
   light of natural reason too, which not only shows such a disposition of
   things to be unworthy the Divine sanctity and majesty, but also shows
   that if there be a future state, it must be a state of misery to wicked
   men, in whose minds those vicious habits prevail, which are even now
   the beginnings of hell; which therefore they must carry along with them
   wherever they are, in proportion to the degree in which they are
   predominant.

   Upon the whole then, you must evidently see that it is absolutely
   necessary that you, sinners, should be changed, if ever you expect to
   have any part or lot in the future happiness. And when do you expect
   that change should be wrought? Do you expect it when death has done its
   dreadful office upon you, and your soul arrives at the invisible world?
   Is the air of it, if I may be allowed the expression, so refined that
   it will immediately purify, and transform every polluted sinner that
   comes into it? You cannot but know, that the whole tenor of scripture
   forbids that presumptuous destructive hope. It assures us that there is
   no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave; (Eccl. ix.
   10;) but that we must be judged according to what we have done in the
   body, and not according to what has passed in a separate state, whether
   the actions we have done be good, or whether they be evil. 2 Cor. v.
   10.

   If ever therefore you are regenerate at all, it must be while you are
   here below, in this state of education and trial: and if you continue
   in your sins till death surprise you, your souls will be forever sealed
   up under an irreversible sentence, and by the decree of God, and the
   constitution of things, will be excluded from happiness, as by no means
   either entitled to it, or prepared for it. So evident is the truth of
   this assertion in the text, that Except a man be born again he cannot
   see the kingdom of God.

   And will you then sit down contentedly under such conclusion as this,
   "I shall be excluded from this kingdom, as accursed and profane?" Alas,
   sirs, the conclusion is big with unutterable terror and death, as I
   should now proceed to show you at large if my time would allow: for I
   am next to represent the infinite importance of entering into that
   kingdom, and consequently of that entire change which has been proved
   to be necessary to that entrance. But I must reserve that to the next
   opportunity of this kind.

   In the mean time let me add, that I doubt not but there are many
   present, who have heard this description of the heavenly world with
   delight, and who are saying in their hearts, "This is my rest forever:
   here will I dwell, for I have desired it: (Psal. cxxxii. 14:) This is
   the felicity to which my heart aspires with the most ardent breathing."
   Such may with the utmost reason regard it as a token for good, and may
   go on in a cheerful assurance, that the grace that has made them meet
   to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, (Col. i.
   12,) will at length conduct them to it, in perfect safety and
   everlasting triumph. Amen.

DISCOURSE VI.

  OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ENTERING INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

  John iii. 3.

   --Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.

   How impossible it is that an unregenerate sinner should see the kingdom
   of God, or enjoy that future blessedness to which the Gospel is
   intended to lead its professors, I have shown you at large. I have
   appealed to the testimony of God's holy prophets, and apostles, in
   concurrence with that of his incarnate Son, to prove that persons of
   such a character are, by the inviolable constitution of that kingdom,
   excluded from it. And I have further, in my last discourse, proved,
   that if they were actually admitted to it, they would be incapable of
   relishing its pleasures: that their vitiated palate would have a
   distaste to the choicest fruits of the Paradise of God; yea, that in
   these blessed regions thorns and briers would spring up in their paths,
   and make them wretched in the very seat of happiness.

   I doubt not, but you are in your consciences generally convinced, that
   the truth of these things cannot be contested. You are inwardly
   persuaded that it is indeed so; and I fear many of you have also reason
   to apprehend, that you are of this unhappy number, who are hitherto
   strangers to regenerating grace. But how are your minds impressed with
   this apprehension? Do I wrong you, sirs, when I suspect that some of
   you are hardly impressed at all? Do I wrong you when I suspect there
   are those of you, who have spent the last week with very little
   reflection upon what you have heard? The cares and amusements of life
   have been pursued as before, and you have not taken one hour to enter
   into the thought with self-application, and seriously to consider, 'I
   am one of these concerning whom eternal wisdom and truth has
   pronounced, that if they continue such as at present they are, they
   shall not see the kingdom of heaven.' You have not paused at all upon
   the awful thought; you have not offered one lively petition to God, to
   beg that you may be recovered from this unhappy state, and brought to a
   meetness for his kingdom, and a title to it. For your sakes therefore,
   and for the sakes of others in your state, having already explained,
   illustrated, and confirmed the proposition in my text, I proceed,

   III. To represent to you the IMPORTANCE of the argument suggested here;
   or to show you how much every unregenerate sinner ought to be alarmed
   to hear, that while he continues in his present state, he cannot see
   the kingdom of God.

   And oh! that while I endeavor to illustrate this, my words might enter
   into your minds, as goads, and might fix there as nails fastened in a
   sure place! The substance of my argument is given forth by the one
   great Shepherd; (Eccles. xii. 11;) may the prosecution of it be
   blessed, as the means of reducing some wandering sheep into his fold.

   Now in order to illustrate the force of this argument, I beseech you
   seriously to consider,---what this kingdom is, from which you are in
   danger of being forever excluded:--and what will be the condition of
   all those, who shall be finally cut off from any interest in it.

   Consider first what that kingdom is, from which the unregenerate, or
   those who are not born again, shall be excluded.

   And here you are not to expect a complete representation of it: for
   that is an attempt in which the tongues of angels, as well as men,
   might fail; or how proper soever their language might be in itself, to
   us it would be unintelligible: for eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
   neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
   prepared for them that love him. 1 Cor. ii. 9. And surely these final
   and most illustrious preparations of his love must, beyond all others,
   exceed our description and conception. A minister, that, with the
   apostle Paul, had been caught up into the third heaven, if he would
   attempt to speak of the glorious scenes which were there opened to him,
   must say, they were unutterable things: (2 Cor. xii. 2, 4:) and one,
   that with John, had lain in the bosom of Christ himself, must say, as
   that Apostle did, It does not yet appear what we shall be. 1 John iii.
   2. And indeed, when we go' about to discourse of it, I doubt not but
   the blessed angels pity the weakness of our apprehensions and
   expressions, and know that we do but debase the subject, when we
   attempt the most to exalt and adorn it.

   Yet there are just and striking representations of this kingdom made in
   the word of God; and we are there often told in general, wherein it
   shall consist. You no doubt remember that I was, in the last of these
   Lectures, going over several important views of it. I then told you, it
   will consist in the perfection of our souls in knowledge and holiness;
   in the sight of God and our blessed Redeemer; in exercising the most
   delightful affections towards them, and in being forever employed in
   rendering them the most honorable services; in conversing with saints
   and glorious angels; and in the assured expectation of the eternal
   continuance of this blessedness in all its branches. That this is the
   scriptural representation of the matter, I proved to you from many
   express testimonies in the word of God; and I doubt not, but you have
   often heard the excellency of each of these views represented at large,
   in distinct discourses on each.

   I will not therefore now repeat what has been said upon such occasions;
   but will rather direct you to some general considerations, which may
   convince you of the excellency of that state and world, from which, if
   you continue unregenerate, you must forever be excluded: for I would
   fain fix it upon your minds, that it is in this connection, and for
   this purpose, that the representation is made. And oh! that you might
   so review it, as no longer to neglect so great salvation, (Heb. ii. 3,)
   nor act as if you judged such everlasting life to be beneath your
   attention, and unworthy your care and regard! Acts xiii. 46. You cannot
   think it so when you consider,--that it is represented in scripture
   under the most magnificent images;--that it is the state which God has
   prepared for the display of his glory, and the entertainment of his
   most favorite creatures; that it is tile purchase of the blood of his
   eternal Son, that it is the main work of his sacred Spirit to prepare
   men's hearts for it; and the great business of our inveterate enemy,
   the devil, by all possible means, to prevent our obtaining it. Each of
   these considerations may much illustrate the excellency of it and all
   taken together yield a most convincing demonstration.

   1. Consider, by what a variety of beautiful and magnificent images this
   happiness is represented in the word of God; and that may convince you
   of its excellency.

   When the blessed God himself would raise our conceptions of a state of
   being, so much superior to anything we have ever seen or known, unless
   he intended a personal and miraculous revelation of it, he must borrow
   our language, and in painting the glory of heaven must take his colors
   from earth. And here the magnificence of a city, the sweetness of a
   garden, the solemn pomp of a temple, the lustre of a crown, and the
   dignity of a kingdom, strike powerfully on the human mind, and fill it
   with veneration and delight. But when such figures as these are
   borrowed from this lower world of ours, faintly to shadow out that
   which is above, there is always the addition of some important
   circumstance, to intimate how far the celestial original: exceeds the
   brightest earthly glory, by which the Divine condescension has
   vouchsafed to describe it.

   The enumeration of a variety of scriptural descriptions will set these
   remarks in the strongest light. If therefore heaven be described as a
   city, it is the New Jerusalem, the city of our God, that cometh down
   from God out of heaven; (Rev. iii. 12, xxi. 2;) the pavement of its
   streets is all of pure gold, its gates are pearl, and its foundations
   jewels. Rev. xxi. 19, 21. If it be a garden, it is the Paradise of God,
   (Rev. ii. 7,) and so far superior to that which he at first prepared
   and furnished out for the entertainment of Adam in his state of
   innocence, that it is planted on every side with the tree of life,
   (Rev. xxii. 2,) of which there was but one alone in the garden of Eden:
   and is watered, not with such common rivers as the Tigris and
   Euphrates, but with that living, copious, inexhausted stream, the river
   of the water of life, which proceeds from the throne of God, (Rev.
   xxii. 1,) and gently glides along through all its borders. When it is
   represented as a temple, we are told that instead of a golden ark
   placed in the remotest recess, to which only the high priest might once
   a year approach, and on which he might not be allowed to gaze, the
   throne of God is erected there, (Rev. vii. 15,) perpetually surrounded
   with myriads of worshipers who see his face, and like the high priest
   when clothed in his richest robes, have his name written in their
   foreheads: (Rev. xxii. 4:) instead of the feeble rays of that golden
   candle. stick, whose lamps shone in the holy place, the heavenly temple
   is illuminated in a more glorious manner, and needs no candle, neither
   light of the sun, for the glory of God continually enlightens it, and
   the Lamb is the light thereof: (Rev. xxi. 23, xxii. 5:) Nay, we are
   assured that its sacred ministers are made kings as well as priests
   unto God; (Rev. i. 6;) and accordingly being clothed in white raiment,
   they have crowns of gold on their heads; (Rev. iv. 4;) as well as harps
   and golden vials, or censers full of incense in their hands: (Rev. v.
   8:) and lest we should think these pompous services are only the
   entertainments of some peculiarly sacred seasons, we are told that they
   rest not day nor night, (Rev. iv. 8,) adoring him that sits upon the
   throne, and are fixed as pillars in his temple, to go out no more. Rev.
   iii. 12. Again, if it be spoken of as a crown, it is represented as
   incorruptible; (1 Cor. ix. 25;) a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
   1 Pet. v. 4. And when it is called a kingdom, the scripture does not
   only add, as here in the text, that it is the kingdom of God, which
   must certainly exalt the idea of it; but that it is a kingdom which can
   not be moved, (Heb. xii. 28,) an everlasting kingdom: (2 Pet. i. 11;)
   nay, to carry our thoughts to the highest degree of dignity and glory,
   it is spoken of as a sitting down with Christ on his throne. Rev. iii.
   21.

   But further, the value of these illustrious representations is much
   enhanced, if we consider the character of the persons by whom they are
   made. They were persons well acquainted with these things, having
   received their information from a Divine revelation, and from the
   immediate visions of God. They were also persons of such sublime and
   elevated sentiments, that they had a sovereign contempt for all the
   enjoyments of time and sense, even those which the generality of
   mankind set the greatest value upon: and counted all things but loss
   for the knowledge of Christ, (Phil. iii. 8,) and the testimony of a
   good conscience, (2 Cor. i. 12,) while they looked not at temporal, but
   at eternal things. 2 Cor. iv. 18. They could deliberately, constantly,
   and even cheerfully, resign all the riches and honors, and carnal
   pleasures, which they might have purchased by their apostacy from
   religion; and were ready to embrace bonds, imprisonments, or death
   itself, when it met them in the way of their duty. Now certainly a
   glory, with which such holy, wise and heroic persons were so
   passionately enamored, and which they describe with such pathos of
   language, and such ecstasy of delight, while they were trampling with
   so generous a disdain on everything which earth calls good and great,
   must deserve our very attentive regard. And this it yet more evidently
   will appear to do, if we consider,

   2. It is the state and world, which God has prepared for the display of
   his glory, and the entertainment of the most favored of his creatures.

   This argument seems to be hinted at, when it is said, as in the place I
   referred to before, eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
   them that love him. 1 Cor. ii. 9. God well knows the capacity of his
   creatures, and how much happiness they are able and fit to receive; and
   he can fill their capacities to the utmost: nay, he can farther enlarge
   them to what degree he pleases, that they may admit superior degrees
   of. glory and felicity. A happiness, therefore, which he has prepared
   on purpose to display the riches of his magnificence and love, and to
   show what he can do to delight his creatures, must certainly be in some
   measure proportionable, if I may so express it, to the infinity of his
   own sacred perfections. Let us then seriously consider who God is; and
   attentively dwell in our meditations on the extent of his power, and
   the riches of his bounty; and our conception of the happiness of heaven
   must be raised to something more glorious, than the most emphatical
   words can perfectly describe.

   And here, to assist our imagination in some degree, let us look round
   us, and take a survey of this visible world. This earth, how
   conveniently has he furnished it, how beautifully has he disposed it,
   how richly has he adorned it! What various and abundant provision has
   he made for the subsistence, the accommodation, and the entertainment
   of the creatures that inhabit it and especially of man, in whom this
   scheme and system of things appears to centre, and to whom it is almost
   wisely and graciously referred! Yet earth is the habitation of a race
   of mean and degenerate creatures, who are but in a state of trial; nay,
   it is the habitation of thousands and ten thousands of God's
   incorrigible enemies, with whom he is angry every day. Psa. vii. 11.
   Already it is marked with some awful characters of the Divine
   displeasure: and the scripture assures us, that it is reserved unto
   fire, against the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men. 2 Pet.
   iii. 7. Yet even this earth is not a spectacle unworthy our regard; nor
   can we, if we allow ourselves to survey it with becoming attention,
   behold it without an affecting mixture of admiration, of love, and of
   joy--passions that will strike us yet more powerfully, if from this
   earth of ours we raise our eyes to the visible heavens; and there
   behold the glory of the sun, the brightness of the moon, and all the
   numerous host of heaven that attend in her train. Who that considers,
   with any degree of attention, their magnitude, their lustre, their
   motion, and their influence, can forbear crying out, Oh Lord, our Lord,
   how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory
   above the heavens. Psal. viii. 1.

   And when, with even these in our view, we further reflect, that there
   is another apartment, as yet invisible, of which this spangled
   firmament is but, as it were, the shining vail; an apartment, where the
   great Creator and Governor of all has fixed his stated residence, and
   erected the throne of his glory; even that throne which is forever
   surrounded by all the most holy and excellent of his creatures; we must
   be convinced, it is something more beautiful, and more magnificent than
   this harmonious system itself. And, methinks, when we have said more
   beautiful and more magnificent than this, imagination is ready to fail
   us, and to leave the mind dazzled and overwhelmed with an effulgency of
   lustre which it cannot delineate, and can scarce sustain. Yet will our
   venerable apprehensions of it be farther assisted if we consider,

   3. That the kingdom of heaven is the great purchase of the blood of
   God's only begotten Son; and therefore to be sure it must be
   inconceivably valuable.

   If you are at all acquainted with your Bibles, you must know that we
   are by sin in a state of alienation from God; (Ephes. iv. 18;) that we
   had forfeited all our title to his love, and stood justly exposed to
   his severe displeasure; and that it is Jesus who delivered us from the
   wrath to come. 1 Thess. i. 10. Now if we owe it to his merit and
   atonement that we live, (1 John iv. 9,) much more are we to ascribe it
   to him, if we are raised to any superior degree of happiness. If God
   could not, with honor to his justice, have suffered us, without such a
   propitiation, to have passed off with impunity; much less could he,
   without it, have received us to his embraces, and have advanced us to
   sit with him on his throne. Rev. iii. 21. Accordingly it is said of the
   blessed martyrs in the heavenly world, even of those who had so
   gloriously distinguished their fidelity and zeal, and loved not their
   lives unto the death; (Rev. xii. 11,) that they had washed their robes,
   and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; (Rev. vii. 14;) and they
   gratefully acknowledge it in their hymns of praise, that Christ had
   redeemed them to God by his blood, and had made them kings and priests
   unto God. Rev. v. 9, 10.

   Now let us seriously reflect, and consider what this blood of the Lamb
   is. The apostle Peter tells us, that silver and gold, and all the
   peculiar treasures of kings and princes, are but corruptible things, (1
   Pet. i. 18, 19,) or perishing and worthless trifles, when compared with
   it. And no wonder it is represented in such exalted language, when we
   consider it was the blood of the only begotten Son of God, who is the
   brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person,
   (Heb. i. 3,) and indeed one with him, (John x. 30,) being possessed of
   a nature truly and properly divine; so that it is called the blood of
   God. Acts xx. 28. We may well argue, even from these transient surveys,
   that it was some important happiness, which he came to procure at so
   expensive a rate. Had an angel been sent down from heaven, we should
   naturally have concluded, it must have been upon some momentous errand:
   surely then, when the Lord of angels comes down, not only to live on
   earth, but to expire in bitter agonies on the cross, to purchase a
   benefit for us, we may be well assured, that this benefit must be very
   considerable. Our Lord Jesus Christ must certainly set a very great
   value upon it, or he would not have purchased it at such a price; and
   we are sure, the value that he apprehended in it must be its true
   value. He could not be imposed upon by any false appearance of glory
   and splendor: he despised, with a just and generous contempt, all the
   kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; (Matt. iv. 8, 10;) and he
   was also well acquainted with the celestial kingdom, having so long
   dwelt in it, and so long presided over it: yet so highly does he esteem
   it, that he speaks of it upon all occasions, as the highest possible
   gift of Divine bounty, the richest preparation and noblest contrivance
   of Divine love: yea, he regards it as a felicity so great, that when he
   conducts his people into it, with the last solemn pomp of the judgment
   day, it is said, he shall see of the travail of his soul, and be
   satisfied, (Isa. liv. 11,) allowing it to be a just equivalent for all
   he has done, and all he has suffered in so glorious a cause.

   4. The excellency of the heavenly kingdom will further appear, if we
   consider, that it is the main work of the Spirit of God upon men's
   hearts, to prepare them for an admittance into it.

   You well know, that the blessed Spirit of God is spoken of as that
   Divine Agent, by whom all the hosts of heaven were created, and all
   God's various works produced; (Job xxxiii. 4;) and it is he that knows
   the things of God even as the human spirit knows the things of a man. 1
   Cor. ii. 11. Now it is his peculiar office in the economy of our
   redemption, to form the soul to a meetness for glory. Accordingly, when
   the apostle Paul had been reminding the Corinthians, that while they
   continued in their sinful state, they were unfit for the kingdom of
   God, he adds, But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
   justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
   1 Cor. vi. 11.

   That the Spirit should condescend to engage at all in such a work, must
   give us a very sublime idea of the end at which it aims. But much more
   will that idea be raised, when we consider with what a variety, and
   what a constancy of operations he begins, continues, and perfects it.
   He attempts it, as we shall hereafter more particularly show you,
   sometimes by convictions of terror, and sometimes by insinuations of
   love; and by one method or another, in the hearts of all the heirs of
   this glory, he works so great a change, that it is represented by
   turning a heart of stone into a heart of flesh, (Ezek. xxxvi. 26,) by
   raising the dead from their graves, (Ezek. xxxvii. 13. Eph. ii. 5, 6,)
   yea, by producing a new creation. 2 Cor. v. 17. Eph. ii. 10. For this
   does he watch over the soul with the tenderest care, and continues his
   friendly offices, to recover it from relapses, and gradually to form it
   to advancing degrees of sanctity, till at length it be enabled to
   perfect holiness in the fear of God. 2 Cor. vii. 1. Nay, so intent is
   this Sacred Agent on the important work, that when sinners most
   insolently and ungratefully reject him, and by resisting him oppose
   their own happiness, he does not immediately leave them; he strikes
   them again and again; and waits upon them for succeeding days and
   months, and years.

   And when, perhaps, the sincere convert makes the most ungrateful return
   for the experience of his goodness, even after he has acknowledged, and
   at length obeyed it: when under the fatal transport of some ungoverned
   passion, and the influence of some strong temptation, he acts as if he
   were intent upon tearing down the work of the Spirit of God upon his
   soul, and driving him forever away; yet in how many instances does he
   return again after all these injuries, pleading the cause of God with a
   sweetly prevailing eloquence, and thus healing the wound, and repairing
   the breach, and making it perhaps stronger than before I And all this,
   for what? That the happy subject of all these kind operations may be
   formed to a fitness for the kingdom of heaven.

   And are we to regard this blessed Spirit as an unmeaning agent, or as
   incapable of judging of the importance of this end for which he acts?
   Is that almighty energy of his employed in an insignificant manner?
   Surely Nicodemus, slow of understanding as he was, must apprehend the
   importance of entering into the kingdom of heaven, when he heard, that
   in order to be admitted to it, a man must be born of the Spirit. And
   let me add once more,

   5. That the excellency of the heavenly kingdom may further be argued
   from the eagerness with which the enemy of souls is endeavoring to
   prevent our entrance into it.

   You know the devil is always represented as the inveterate enemy of our
   happiness. His rage is expressed by that of a roaring lion, that walks
   about, seeking whom he may devour: (1 Peter v. 9:) and with unwearied
   diligence he is continually employed in forming and pursuing his
   temptations. And this is the grand design of all, that he may exclude
   us from the promised felicity. While sinners are in their unregenerate
   state, he endeavors to engage all their regards to the objects of time
   and sense; and for that purpose he continually presents them with a
   variety of entertainments and amusements suited to their respective
   tempers and circumstances. If they are awakened to any serious concern
   about their eternal salvation, he uses his utmost address to divert
   their minds from an attendance to it: and for this purpose he displays
   before them all the allurements of sin in its most engaging forms, and
   if they are not captivated with these, he often puts on a face of
   terror, and endeavors to affright them from religion by the most gloomy
   representations of it, or by horrible and distracting suggestions, that
   it is now forever too late to attain it.

   Or, if Divine Grace surmount all this opposition, and the sinner
   resolutely chooses his portion in heaven, and puts his soul into the
   hands of Christ to be conducted to it, the malice of Satan pursues him
   even to that sacred retreat, which he has sought in the arms of his
   Saviour: and if he cannot prevent the soul from entering into heaven,
   he will at least labor to bring it into such a state of negligence, and
   to seduce it into those delays and relapses, which may divert its
   regards to that blessed world, which may cloud its evidences of it, and
   may at least, as much as possible, diminish the degree of its glory
   there.

   Now permit me, in this instance, to turn the artillery of this cunning
   enemy against himself, and to argue the excellency of this kingdom,
   from the zeal and attachment with which he endeavors to obstruct your
   attaining it. Though Satan be now a very degenerate creature, he was
   once an angel of light, and still retains much of the knowledge, though
   he has lost the rectitude and integrity of the angelic nature. And he
   particularly knows what heaven is because he was once an inhabitant
   there; and while he is endeavoring to persuade the sinner to prefer
   earth before it, he does, by that very endeavor, incontestably prove,
   that he himself knows the contrary, and is fully apprized that there is
   nothing here to be compared with the felicity of the future state. And
   therefore while he seeks the destruction of the soul, he can leave it
   in the enjoyment of all its worldly prosperity; nay, he will attempt to
   lead him into methods, by which this prosperity may be promoted and
   increased.

   And thus, sirs, I have endeavored a little to represent to you, what
   this kingdom of heaven is from which we are assured that unconverted
   sinners shall forever be excluded. I have argued its excellency--from
   the representations which are made of it in the word of God--from its
   being the preparation of Divine love--from its being the purchase of a
   Redeemer's blood--and the end to which, on the one hand, the glorious
   operations of the blessed Spirit lead--and of which, on the other hand,
   all the stratagems and assaults of the prince of darkness are intended
   to deprive us. If, therefore, there be truth in scripture, if there be
   wisdom in heaven, or policy in hell, it must surely be infinitely
   important. And will any of you be such mean-spirited creatures, as,
   when that happiness is proposed to you, basely to relinquish the
   pursuit of it, and to sacrifice this blessed hope to any perishing
   trifle of mortal life? Surely it would be madness; though nothing more
   were to be apprehended than the loss of it; and though, when heaven
   were lost, all that earth can give should remain, if not to
   counterbalance the loss, yet at least to make you less sensible of it.
   But the weight of the argument will much more evidently appear, if you
   consider,

   Secondly, What will at last become of all those who are excluded from
   this heavenly kingdom?

   And here I beseech you to ask your own consciences, whether they be not
   inwardly persuaded, that those who are excluded from heaven, will
   remain in a state of existence, in which they will be ever sensible of
   their loss, and will be delivered over by Divine vengeance into that
   seat of torment, which God has prepared for the punishment of his
   implacable and incorrigible enemies. This many of you do undoubtedly
   believe of such persons in general; believe it, therefore, of
   yourselves, if you are, and continue, in an unregenerate state.

   1. You will still continue in a state of existence, in which you will
   be ever sensible of your unspeakable loss.

   It might afford some wretched kind of consolation to you, if, as soon
   as you died out of this world, your being or your apprehensive powers
   were immediately to cease. Then the loss of heaven would only be an
   affliction to you in your dying moments, when you saw the enjoyments of
   earth were come to an end, and that you must have no part in any future
   happiness. But, alas! sirs, you cannot but know that when your bodies
   are dead, and consumed in their graves, your thinking faculties will
   still be continued to you: and, oh, that you would seriously reflect,
   how they will then be employed! You will then be thinking what you have
   done in life, what you have chosen for your happiness, and what has
   been the consequence of that choice. You will look round in vain for
   such accommodations and pleasures as you were once most fond of: but
   they will be no more. And when you perceive them vanished, like the
   visionary amusements of a dream, you will lift up your astonished eyes
   towards the regions of glory. And you indeed will have a lively view of
   those happy regions: but to what purpose will that view serve? Only
   through the righteous vengeance of God to aggravate your misery and
   despair.

   "Alas," you will think, "there are millions of creatures yonder in
   heaven, who are rejoicing in the sight and favor of God, and are as
   full of happiness as their natures can contain, and shall be so
   forever; while I am cut off from all share in the Divine bounty. Rivers
   of pleasures are flowing in upon them, while not one drop is sent down
   to me; nor could I obtain it, though I were to ask the favor from the
   least of Christ's servants there. I am cast out as an accursed wretch,
   with whom God and his holy and blessed creatures will have no farther
   intercourse, or communion. And why am I thus cast out? and why am I
   thus cut off from God's favor, and driven from his presence, while so
   many that dwell with me on earth are admitted to it? My nature was
   originally as capable of happiness as theirs: and though it was sadly
   degenerate, it might, like theirs, have been renewed. God was once
   offering me that grace, by which my disordered soul might have been
   transformed, and I might have been fitted for the regions of glory: but
   I despised all these offers, and gave the preference to those fading
   vanities, which, alas I have forever forsaken me. And now they that
   were ready are gone in to the delightful banquet, and the door is shut;
   (Matt. xxv. 10;) the everlasting gates are shut forever, and barred
   against me. And here I must lie at this miserable distance, envying and
   raging at their happiness--of which, whatever sight or knowledge I may
   have of it, I must never, never, never partake!"

   Such reflections, as these, sirs, will cut deep into your souls; and
   accordingly our Lord declares to impenitent sinners in his own days,
   There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see others
   sitting down in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. Luke
   xiii. 28. And if you would reflect, you might easily apprehend this.
   How would you be enraged at yourselves, if by your folly you had
   neglected securing a plentiful estate, when it was offered to you on
   the most easy terms; and you actually saw others, once your equals, and
   perhaps your inferiors, in the possession of it, in consequence of
   having taken those methods which you stupidly neglected? The
   reflection, I doubt not, would very much impair the pleasure you might
   find in other comfortable and agreeable circumstances. How much more
   insupportable then will the loss of heaven appear to you, when you come
   to see, and know, what it is you have lost, and have nothing to relieve
   or support you, under the painful recollection?

   It is to no purpose to object, that upon the principles of my last
   discourse, there will be no room to lament your exclusion from those
   entertainments, which you would be incapable of relishing if you were
   admitted to them: for you will then see, and lament that incapacity as
   a very great misery. As if a man, who was naturally fond of feasting
   and mirth, should see a great many regaling themselves, and reveling
   about him, while he was languishing under some painful distemper, which
   made him incapable of joining in the entertainment; he would yet grieve
   that he had no part in it: and it would be the increase, rather than
   the alleviation of his uneasiness, that it was his sickness which
   unfitted him for it; especially if, as in your case, it was a sickness,
   which he had brought upon himself by his own folly, and for which he
   had been offered an easy, pleasant, and infallible remedy, which he had
   refused to use till the malady was grown utterly incurable. One would
   imagine, this thought would be enough to impress you; but if it do not,
   let me entreat, and even charge you, to consider.

   2. That if you are excluded from the kingdom of heaven, you will be
   consigned over to those regions of darkness, despair, and misery, which
   God has prepared for those unhappy criminals, who are the objects of
   his final displeasure, and whom he will render everlasting monuments of
   his wrath.

   There is something in human nature, that starts back at the thought of
   annihilation with strong reluctance: and yet how many thousands are
   there in this miserable world, who would with all their souls fly to it
   as a refuge! They shall seek death, as an inspired writer strongly
   expresses it, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death
   shall flee from them. Rev. ix. 6. I will not attempt to enter into a
   detail of the horrors, attending the place and state, into which all
   who are excluded from the glories of the heavenly world shall be cast,
   and in which they shall be fixed. Let that one awful scripture suffice
   for a specimen of many more; in which we are told, that every one whose
   name was not found written in the book of life, or who was not
   registered in the number of those, who were to inhabit the New
   Jerusalem, or the kingdom of heaven, was cast into the lake of fire,
   (Rev. xx. 25,) or, as it is afterwards expressed, into the lake that
   burns with fire and brimstone. Rev. xxi. 8. Think of this, and ask your
   own hearts, you that are so impatient of the little evils of mortal
   life, whether you can endure to take up your abode forever in devouring
   fire, or whether you can dwell with everlasting burnings? Isa. xxxiii.
   14. Yet these are the images by which the word of God represents it; to
   be plunged as in a sea of liquid fire, whose flames are exasperated and
   heightened, by being fed with brimstone; nay, as the prophet speaks, by
   a copious stream of brimstone, so expressly appointed by God himself,
   that this, as well as the river of the water of life, is represented as
   proceeding immediately from him: he has made Tophet deep and large: the
   pile thereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord, like a
   stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. Isa. xxx. 33.

   It is painful to a tender mind to think of this, as what its
   fellow-creatures are obnoxious to: it is grievous to speak of it in
   these dreadful terms. But who are we, that we should be more merciful
   than God? Or rather, how can we imagine it is mercy, to avoid speaking
   of the appointment of infinite wisdom, for the punishment of impenitent
   sinners? What mercy were that, sirs, to avoid to mention these terrors
   to you, and to neglect to warn you of them, because they are great?
   which is indeed the very reason why the scripture thus pathetically
   describes them.

   Away therefore with this foolish, this treacherous compassion, which
   chooses rather to leave men to be consumed, than to disturb their
   slumbers. Think, sirs, of that wretched man, whom Christ describes as
   lifting up his eyes in hell, being in torments; seeing the regions of
   the blessed at an unapproachable distance, and begging in vain that one
   drop of water might be sent to cool his tongue, amidst all the raging
   thirst with which he was tormented in this flame. Luke xvi. 23, 24.
   Regard it attentively; for as God lives, and as your soul lives, if you
   continue in an unrenewed state, you see in that wretch the very image
   and representation of yourselves. Yes, sinners, I testify it to you
   this day, that intolerable as it seems, it will on that supposition be
   your own certain fate; or to speak much more properly, your righteous,
   but inevitable doom. Heaven and earth will desert you in that dreadful
   hour: or if the inhabitants of both were to join to intercede for you,
   it would be in vain. Sentence will be past, and execution done. Hell
   will open its mouth to receive you, and shut it again forever to
   enclose you, with thousands, and ten thousands more, among whom you
   will not find one to comfort you, but every one ready to afflict you.
   Then shall you know the value which God sets upon his heavenly kingdom,
   by the judgments he inflicts upon you for neglecting and despising it;
   and then shall you know the importance of being born again, that only
   means by which Hell can be avoided, and Heaven secured.

   And let me farther add, that conviction will quickly come in this
   terrible way, if you are not now prevailed upon to consider these
   things; things which, if you have the least regard to the word of God,
   you cannot but notionally believe. Do not then go about to annihilate,
   as it were, these prospects to your mind, by placing them at a long
   distance. The distance is not so great as to deserve mention. The
   patience of God will not wait upon you for thousands, or even hundreds
   of years; you have a few mortal days, in which to consider of the
   matter; or rather, you have the present moment to consider of it. And
   if you improve the opportunity, it is well; but if not, the just and
   uniform methods of the divine administration shall proceed, though it
   should be to your ruin. God has vindicated the honors of his violated
   law, and despised Gospel, upon millions, who with the rebel-angels, by
   whom they have been seduced, are even now reserved in everlasting
   chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day; (Jude, verse
   6;) and he will as surely vindicate them upon you. If you do not
   repent, if you are not regenerate, you shall all likewise perish, (Luke
   xiii. 3,) and not one of you shall escape.

   And thus I close this copious and important argument: this argument, in
   which life and death, salvation and damnation are concerned. View it,
   my friends, in all its connection, and see in what part of it the chain
   can be broken. Will you say, that without regeneration you can secure
   an interest in the kingdom of heaven, though the constitution of heaven
   oppose it, and all the declarations of God's word stand directly
   against it; and though nature itself proclaim, and conscience testify
   your incapacity to enjoy it? Or will you say, that being excluded from
   it, you shall suffer no considerable damage, though you lose so
   glorious a state, the noblest preparation of Divine love, the purchase
   of redeeming blood, and the end of the Spirit's operation on the soul;
   though you ever remain sensible of your loss, and be consigned over to
   dwell in that flaming prison, which God has prepared for the devil and
   his angels, and where all the terrors of his righteous judgment are
   made known?

   But if you are indeed inwardly convinced of the truth and importance of
   these things, and will go away, and act as before, without any regard
   to them, I can say no more The reason of man, and the word of God can
   point out no stronger arguments, than an infinite good on the one hand,
   and an infinite evil on the other.

   Hear, therefore, O heavens! and give ear O earth! and let angels and
   devils join their astonishment; that creatures, who would strenuously
   contend, and warmly exert themselves, I will not say merely for an
   earthly kingdom, but in an affair where only a few pounds, or perhaps a
   few shillings or pence were concerned, are indifferent here, where, by
   their own confession, a happy or miserable eternity is in question. For
   indifferent, I fear, some of you are and will continue. I have
   represented these things in the integrity of my heart, as in the sight
   of God, not in artful forms of speech, but in the genuine language,
   which the strong emotions of my own soul, in the views of them, most
   naturally dictated. Yet I think it not at all improbable, that some of
   you, and some perhaps who do not now imagine it, will, as soon as you
   return home, divert your thoughts and discourses to other objects; and
   may, perhaps, as heretofore, lie down upon your beds without spending
   one quarter of an hour, or even one serious minute, in lamenting your
   miserable state before God, and seeking that help and deliverance which
   his grace alone can give. But if you thus lie down, make, if you can, a
   covenant with death that it may not break in upon your slumbers; and an
   agreement with hell, (Isa. xxviii. 15,) that before the return of the
   morning, it may not flash in upon your careless souls another kind of
   conviction, than they will now receive from the voice of reason and the
   word of God.

DISCOURSE VII.

  OF THE NECESSITY OF DIVINE INFLUENCES TO PRODUCE REGENERATION IN THE SOUL.

  Titus iii. 5, 6.

   Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his
   mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
   Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our
   Saviour.

   IF my business were to explain and illustrate this scripture at large,
   it would yield an ample field for accurate criticism and useful
   discourse, and more especially would lead us into a variety of
   practical remarks, on which it would be pleasant to dilate in our
   meditations. It evidently implies that those, who are saved of the
   Lord, are brought to the practice of good works, without which faith is
   dead, (James ii. 17,) and all pretences to a saving change are not only
   vain, but insolent. Yet it plainly testifies to us, that our salvation,
   and acceptance with God, is not to be ascribed to these, but to the
   Divine mercy; which mercy operates by sanctifying our hearts, through
   the renewing influence of the Holy Spirit: And that there is an,
   abundant effusion of this Spirit under the Gospel, which is therefore,
   with great propriety, called the ministration of the Spirit, (2 Cor.
   iii. 8,) and the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. Rom. viii.
   2.

   But I must necessarily, in pursuance of my general scheme, waive
   several of these remarks, that I may leave myself room to insist on the
   grand topic I intend from the words.

   I have already shown you, who may be said to be in an unregenerate
   state: I have also described the change which regeneration makes in the
   soul; and have largely shown you, in the three last discourses, the
   absolute necessity and importance of it. And now I proceed,

   To show the necessity of the Divine power, in order to produce this
   great and important change.

   This is strongly implied in the words of the text: in which the
   apostle, speaking of the method God has been pleased to take for the
   display of his goodness in the salvation and happiness of fallen men,
   gives us this affecting view of it, that it is not by works of
   righteousness which we, i. e. any of us Christians, have done; but
   according to his free grace and mercy that he has saved us by the
   washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. . . . . .

   Lest any should imagine, that an external ceremony (baptism) was
   sufficient, or that it was the chief thing intended, the apostle takes
   the matter higher. And as the apostle Peter tells us, that the baptism
   which saves us is not merely the putting away the filth of the flesh,
   but the answer of a good conscience towards God; (1 Pet. iii. 21;) so
   the apostle Paul here adds, that we are saved by the renewing of the
   Holy Ghost: by which I can by no means understand something entirely
   distinct from, and subsequent to his regenerating influences; for
   according to the view of regeneration stated in our former discourses,
   none can be regenerated who are not renewed: but it seems to explain
   the former clause, and to refer to the more positive effect produced by
   Divine grace on the soul, whereby Christians are not only purified from
   sin, but disposed to, and quickened in a course of holy obedience. And
   then he further tells us, that this Spirit is the gift of God, and is
   plentifully communicated to us in the name, and through the hands of
   the blessed Redeemer, being shed on us abundantly by God, through Jesus
   Christ our Saviour.

   Agreeably therefore to the general design and purport of these words, I
   shall go on to demonstrate the absolute necessity of a Divine agency
   and operation in this great work of our regeneration; which I shall do
   from a variety of topics. And here I shall studiously waive many
   controversies, with which the Christian world has been afflicted, and
   the soundest part of it disturbed, with relation to the kind and manner
   of this influence. I will not so much as mention them, and much less
   discuss them; lest Satan should take an advantage of us, (1 Cor. ii.
   11,) to divert our minds from what is essential in this doctrine, to
   what is merely circumstantial. Only let it be observed in general, that
   I speak of such an agency of God on our minds, as offers no violence to
   the rational and active nature which God has given us, nor does by any
   means supersede our obligation to those duties which his word requires;
   but on the contrary, cures and perfects our nature, and disposes the
   soul to a regard to such incumbent duties, and strengthens it in the
   discharge of them. With this only preliminary, which appears to me
   highly important, I proceed to show the reasonableness of ascribing
   this change to a Divine agency, rather than to anything else, which may
   be supposed to have any share in producing it. And we may infer this,

   First, from the general and necessary dependence of the whole created
   world upon God.

   There was a philosophical as well as Divine truth, in that observation
   of the apostle Paul at Athens, which was well worthy the most learned
   assembly; In him, i. e. in God, we live, and move, and have our being.
   Acts xvii. 28. Such is the innate weakness of created nature, that it
   continually depends on a Divine support. The very idea of its being
   created, supposes that it had no cause of its existence, but the Divine
   will in the first moment of it; and if it could not then subsist
   without that will, in the first moment of its existence, it neither
   could subsist without it in the second, or in any future moment of it;
   since to have been dependent for a while, can never be supposed to
   render anything for the future independent. The continued existence
   then of all the creatures--no less of angels, than of worms, or trees,
   or stones-- does properly depend upon the Divine energy which bears
   them up; and holds those of them in life, which live, and those of them
   in being, which are inanimate, or without life.

   And if their being be dependent, then surely it will follow, that all
   their perceptive and active powers, whatsoever they are, must
   continually depend upon God: for to exist with such powers is evidently
   more than simply to exist; and if a Divine agency be necessary for the
   latter, much more must we allow it to be necessary for the former.

   The human mind, therefore, with all its capacities and improvements,
   must acknowledge itself perpetually indebted to God, who is the
   fountain of truth and wisdom, as well as of being: accordingly we are
   told, it is he that teacheth man knowledge. Psal. xciv. 1. All the
   skill of the husbandman, in one passage of Scripture, (Isa. xxviii.
   26,) and all the wisdom of the artificer, in another, (Exod. xxxvi. 1,
   2,) is ascribed to his influence: and if the improvement of the
   sciences, and any other discovery, which renders human life in any
   degree more commodious and agreeable, is to be ascribed to the Divine
   illumination and influence, then surely it is from hence this art of
   living wisely and well must also be derived. All the views upon which
   good resolutions are formed, all the strong impressions upon the mind
   arising from these views, and all the steadiness and determination of
   spirit, which does not only form such purposes, but carries them into
   execution, are plainly the effect of the Divine agency on the mind;
   without which no secular affairs could be clearly understood,
   strenuously pursued, or successfully accomplished. And how peculiarly
   reasonable it is, to apply this remark to the point now in view, will
   appear by attending,

   Secondly, to the greatness and excellency of this regenerating change,
   which speaks it aloud to be the Divine work.

   I must, upon this occasion, desire you to recollect what I laid before
   you in several of the former discourses. Think of the new light that
   breaks in upon the understanding; of the new affections that are
   enkindled in the heart; of the new resolutions, by which the will is
   sweetly and powerfully, though most freely influenced; and think of the
   degree of vigor attending these resolutions, and introducing a series
   of new labors and pursuits; and surely you must confess, that it is the
   finger of God; especially when you consider, how beautiful and
   excellent, as well as how great the work is.

   Do we acknowledge, that it was the voice of God that first commanded
   the light to shine out of darkness, and that it was worthy of a Divine
   agency to produce so Beautiful a creature as the sun, to gild the whole
   face of our world, and to dress the different objects around us in such
   a varied and vivid assemblage of colors? And shall we not allow it to
   be much more worthy of him, to lighten up a benighted soul, and reduce
   its chaos into harmony and order? Was it worthy of God to form the
   first principles even of the vegetative life, in the lowest plant or
   herb, and to visit with refreshing influences of the rain and sun the
   earth wherein these seeds are sown? And is it not much more worthy of
   him to implant the seed of the divine life, and to nourish it from time
   to time by the influence of his Spirit? Did it suit the Divine wisdom
   and mercy to provide for sustaining our mortal lives, for healing our
   wounds, and recovering us from our diseases? And shall it not much more
   suit him, to act as the great Physician of souls, in restoring them to
   ease, to health and vigor?

   They must be dead indeed to all sense of spiritual excellence, who do
   not see how much more illustriously God appears, when considered as the
   author of grace, than merely as the author of nature. For indeed all
   the works of nature, and all the instances of Divine interposition to
   maintain its order and harmony, will chiefly appear valuable and
   important, when considered in subserviency to the gracious design of
   recovering apostate man from the ruin of his degenerate state--without
   which it had been far better for him never to have known being, and
   never to have inhabited a world so liberally furnished with a variety
   of good. And, therefore, I would appeal to every Christian, whether he
   does not find a much more ardent gratitude glowing in his heart when he
   considers God as the author of the religious and divine, than merely of
   the animal or the rational life?

   And permit me here to remark, that, agreeably to these reasonings, some
   of the pagan philosophers have said very serious and remarkable things
   concerning the reality and the need of Divine influences on the mind,
   for the production of virtue and piety there. Thus, Seneca, when he is
   speaking of a resemblance to the Deity in character, ascribes it to the
   influence of God upon the mind: "Are you surprised," says he, "that man
   should approach to the gods? It is God that comes to men; nay, which is
   yet more, he enters into them; for no mind becomes virtuous but by his
   assistance." [4] Simplicius, also, was so sensible of the necessity of
   such an influence, that he "prays to God, as the father and guide of
   reason, so to co-operate with us, as to purge us from all carnal and
   brutish affections, that we may be enabled to act according to the
   dictates of reason, and to attain to the true knowledge of himself."
   [5] And Maximus Tyrius argues, agreeably to what is said above, that
   "if skill in the professions and sciences is insinuated into men's
   minds, by a Divine influence, we can much less imagine, that a thing so
   much more excellent, as virtue is, can be the work of any mortal art;
   for strange must be the notion that we have of God, to think that he is
   liberal and free in matters of less moment, and sparing in the
   greatest." [6] And in the same discourse he tells us, "that even the
   best disposed minds, as they are seated in the midst, between the
   highest virtue and extreme wickedness, need the assistance and the help
   of God, to incline and lead them to the better side." [7] I am sensible
   that all these philosophers, with many more who speak to the same
   purpose, living after Christ's time, may be said to have learned such
   language from Christians: and if they did so, I wish all who have since
   worn the name had been equally teachable. But some who appeared much
   earlier, speak much in the same manner, [8] as I might easily show you,
   if it were not already more than time to observe,

   Thirdly. That we may further argue the Divine agency in this blessed
   work, from the violent opposition over which it prevails in its rise
   and progress.

   The awakened soul, when laboring towards God, and aspiring after
   further communications of his grace to form it for his service, may
   justly say with David, Lord, how are they increased that trouble me?
   How many are they that rise up against me? Ps. iii. 1. With how many
   threatening dangers are we continually surrounded! And what a numerous
   host of enemies are ready to oppose us! The law of sin, that wars in
   our members, (Rom. vii. 23,) and concerning whose forces it may well be
   said, their name is Legion, for they are many: the evil influence of a
   degenerate world, whose corrupt examples press like a torrent, and
   require the most vigorous efforts to bear up against them: and in
   confederacy with these, and at the head of all, the Prince of
   Darkness--whose counsels and efforts, with relation to this world of
   ours, do as it were centre in this one thing, to prevent men's
   regeneration; because it is by means of this, that those are recovered
   out of the snare of the devil, who were before led captive by him at
   his will. 2 Tim. ii. 26.

   I persuade myself, that when I am speaking on this head, though some
   may imagine it to be mere empty harangue, and common place declamation,
   the experienced soul will attest the truth of what I say. It may be
   s6me of you, who, by what of these sermons you have already heard, have
   come under some serious convictions, and been awakened in go6d earnest
   to be thoughtful about being born again, have felt such a struggle in
   your own minds that you may say, you never knew before what the flesh,
   the world, and the devil were, nor could have imagined that their
   opposition to this work was so forcible and violent as you now find it.
   To reform the irregularities of the life is comparatively easy; but to
   root sin out of the soul, to consecrate the whole heart to God, and
   demolish those idols that have been set up, as it were, in the secret
   chambers of imagery, (Ezek. viii. 12,) is difficult indeed; all the
   corruptions of the heart in such a case are ready to exert themselves,
   and it is natural for the lusts of the flesh to unite against that
   which is set upon destroying them all; nor did you ever know before,
   that there was such a world of sin within you. With violence also does
   the strong man armed exert himself, when his goods are about to be
   taken from him by one stronger than himself: as our Lord, with an
   unerring propriety and wisdom, represents it; (Luke xi. 21, 22;) and
   indeed it seems as if through the violence of his malignity, and the
   righteous judgment of God, who, whenever he pleases, can take the wise
   in his own craftiness, (1 Cor. iii. 19,) that Satan sometimes
   overshoots his mark, and raises so sensible an opposition against the
   cause of God in the soul, that an argument might be drawn, even from
   that very opposition, to prove the truth and excellency of what he sets
   himself so directly against. And you have now perhaps experienced, too,
   more than you ever did before, the inveterate opposition of the seed of
   the Serpent to that of the Woman: you have found, that since you began
   to think of religion in good earnest, some have derided you, others it
   may be have reviled you, and enemies have sprung up out of your own
   house: (Matt. x. 36;) though the impressions you have felt tend to make
   you more amiable, more kind, and more useful, and therefore one would
   think should conciliate their friendship: but this is a memorable
   instance in which self-love seems to make, as it were, a sacrifice of
   itself to the hatred of God. Now, therefore, to accomplish such a
   mighty change in the midst of such opposition, must evidently speak a
   Divine interposition. And surely the Christian, when thus recovered and
   restored, has reason to declare, as Israel did, if it had not been the
   Lord who was on our side when these confederate enemies rose up against
   us, then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled
   against us; then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone
   over our soul, then the proud waters had gone over our soul, (Psal.
   cxxiv. 1-5,) and would have quenched and buried every spark that looked
   like Divine life, and have borne away every purpose of reformation and
   holiness. The remark will be further illustrated, if we consider,

   Fourthly, By what feeble means this change is accomplished.

   The apostle observes, that in his day they had the treasure of the
   gospel lodged in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power,
   which rendered it successful, might appear to be of God and not of man.
   2 Cor. iv. 7. And it is still in a great measure apparent, that the
   same method is made use of from the same principle. The weapons of our
   warfare are not carnal; and if at any time they are mighty and
   effectual, it must be only through God. 2 Cor. x. 4. It is not by
   secular might or power, (Zech. iv. 6,) that this great work is
   accomplished: no, nor by the refinements of learning, or the charms of
   eloquence. These things indeed have their use; the understanding may
   sometimes be convinced by the one, and the affections moved by the
   other: yet where both these have been done, the work often drops short:
   and it may be the plainest addresses, from a weak and almost trembling
   tongue, shall perform that which the far superior talents of many have
   not been able to effect. A multitude of such instances has been found,
   and perhaps seldom in these latter ages more observable than in the
   compass of our own observation.

   Now whenever this work is accomplished by the preaching of the gospel
   in a Christian country, there is generally some circumstance that shows
   it is a divine, and not a human work. It is not the novelty of the
   doctrine which strikes; for all the main truths, on which the
   conviction and impression turns, have been known even from early
   infancy. No miracles awaken the attention, no new doctrines astonish
   the mind; but what has a thousand times been heard, and as often
   neglected, breaks in upon the mind with an almost irresistible energy,
   and strikes it as if it never had been heard of before. They seem as
   Israel did, when the Lord turned again their captivity, to awake out of
   a dream, (Ps. cxxvi. 1,) and wonder at the influence that has awakened
   them. The ministry of the word may seem but feeble, when compared to
   such an event: and yet sometimes even less solemn methods than that
   shall be effectual. One single text of scripture occurring to the sight
   or thought, one serious hint dropped in conversation, shall strike the
   mind, and pierce it through with an energy that plainly shows, that
   from whatever feeble hand it might seem to come, it was shot out of the
   quiver of God, and intended by him that made the heart to reach it:
   since there is almost as much disproportion between the cause and the
   effect, as between Moses lifting up his rod and the dividing of the
   water of the sea before Israel. Exod. xiv. 16. In many instances,
   remarkable providences, which one would have thought should have struck
   the soul as it were to the centre, have produced no effect: and yet a
   word, or a thought, has accomplished it; and after the whirlwind, the
   earthquake, and the fire have made their successive efforts in vain, it
   has appeared that the Lord has been in the still small voice. 1 Kings
   xix. 1, 12. On the whole, a variety of circumstances may illustrate the
   matter in different degrees; but, taking it in a general view, the
   remark appears to be well founded, that the weakness of the means, by
   which the saving change is wrought, argues plainly that the hand of God
   is in it: as when anointing the eyes with spittle gave sight to the
   blind, (John ix. 6,) it was evidently the exertion of a miraculous
   power. But now, agreeably to what has been advanced under these several
   heads, I shall proceed to show at large,

   Fifthly, That the Scripture teaches us to ascribe this great change on
   the mind to a Divine agency and operation.

   And here you will see, that it does not merely drop here and there an
   expression which is capable of such an interpretation, but that the
   whole tenor of the word of God leads to such a conclusion: and surely,
   if we own the word to be divine, we need no more convincing argument of
   the truth of this remark. The only difficulty I shall here find, will
   be like that which occurred under the former head, and proceeds from
   the variety and multiplicity of texts which offer them selves to me
   while reflecting on this subject; however, I will endeavor to rank them
   in the plainest and best order I can, under the following particulars.
   We find God sometimes promises to produce such a change in men's minds;
   and at other times he speaks of it as his own work, when it has been
   already produced: the scripture represents even the increase of piety
   in a regenerate heart, as the effect of a Divine power; and how much
   more must the first implanting of it be so: nay, it goes yet further
   than this, and expresses the necessity as well as the reality of a
   Divine influence on the mind to make it truly religious, and resolves
   the want of true religion into this, that God withholds his influence.
   If, therefore, any one, and much more if all these particulars can be
   made out, I think it must force a conviction on your judgment at least,
   that what we are endeavoring to confirm in this discourse is the
   doctrine of scripture.

   1. There are various places in scripture, wherein God promises to
   produce such a change in men's minds as we have before described; which
   plainly shows that it is to be acknowledged as his work.

   Thus Moses says to Israel, without all doubt by the Divine direction,
   The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed,
   to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
   that thou mayest live. Deut. xxx. 6. And this circumcision of the heart
   must surely be the removal of some insensibility and pollution adhering
   to it, and bringing it to a more orderly, regular, obedient state. It
   is sometimes made matter of exhortation, and thus indeed proves that
   there is a view in which it may be considered as a DUTY incumbent upon
   us (as when Moses said, circumcise the foreskin of your heart; (Deut.
   x. 16;) and Jeremiah, in imitation of him, circumcise yourselves to the
   Lord, and take away the foreskin of your heart. (Jer. iv. 4.) Here it
   is put in the form of a promise, to signify that wherever it was done,
   it was in consequence of God's preventing and assisting grace.

   On the same principle, the Father promises to Christ, thy people shall
   be willing in the day of thy power. Ps. cx. 3. But if any pretend that
   these words may possibly admit of another version, though I know none
   more just than this, there are many other parallel places which are not
   attended with any ambiguity at all. Such, in particular, is that
   gracious promise, which though it was immediately made to the house of
   Israel, Sis nevertheless quoted by the apostles as expressive of God's
   gospel covenant with all believers; After those days, saith the Lord, I
   will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,
   and I will be their God, and they shall be my people: (Jer. xxxi. 33;
   Heb. viii. 19:) or, as it is elsewhere expressed by the same prophet
   Jeremiah, I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me
   forever; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not
   depart from me. Jer. xxxiii. 32, 39, 40. And Ezekiel echoes back the
   same language by the same Spirit; I will give them one heart, and I
   will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out
   of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; that they may walk
   in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; (Ezek. xi. 19,
   20:) which is afterwards repeated again almost in the same words: A new
   heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and
   I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
   a heart of flesh; and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to
   walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. Ezek.
   xxxvi. 26, 27.

   Now such a transformation of the heart and spirit as may be represented
   by a thorough renovation, or by changing stone into flesh, speaks the
   doctrine I am asserting in as plain terms as we could contrive or
   express; and beautifully points out at once the greatness and
   excellency of the change, and the Almighty power by which it is
   effected; for we may assure ourselves God would never promise such
   influences, if he did not really mean to impart them. But again,

   2. Agreeably to the tenor of these promises, the scripture also
   ascribes this work to a Divine agency, when it is effected.

   Thus the apostle John, when he is speaking of those who, on receiving
   Christ, become the sons of God, declares concerning them that they were
   born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
   man, but of God: (John i. 13:) plainly intimating that it was to him,
   and not only or chiefly to themselves or others, that this happy change
   was to be ascribed: which is well explained by those words of St.
   James, in which he says, of his own will begat he us with the word of
   truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures. Jam.
   i. 18. Accordingly our Lord, as you have heard at large, insists upon
   it as absolutely necessary to a man's entering into the kingdom of God,
   not only that he should be born again, but more particularly that he
   should be born of the Spirit, (John iii. 3, 5,) i. e. by the
   sanctifying influence of the Spirit of God operating upon his soul, to
   purify and cleanse it.

   And as this great work of regeneration chiefly consists in being
   brought to faith and repentance, you may observe, that each of these
   are spoken of as a Divine production in the mind, or as the gift of God
   to it. Thus the believing Jews, with one consent, expressed their
   conviction when they heard the story of Cornelius and declare, then has
   God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. Acts xi. 18. And
   so the apostle Paul expresses it, when speaking of the possibility that
   some might be recovered out of the snare of the devil, he says, If God
   peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
   truth. 2 Tim. ii. 25, 26. That very attention to the Gospel, which is
   the first step towards the production of faith in the soul, is resolved
   into this, when it is said, that the Lord opened Lydia's heart, that
   she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul. Acts xvi. 41. And
   with regard to the progress of it, it is not only said in general, you
   hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; but faith is
   expressly declared to be the gift of God; (Eph. ii. 1, 8;) and the
   apostle says to the Philippians, that it was given to them to believe;
   (Phil. i. 29;) nay, it is represented as a most glorious and
   illustrious effort of Divine power, and ascribed to the exceeding
   greatness of his power towards them that believe, according to the
   working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised
   him from the dead. Eph. i. 19, 20.

   And in this view it is, that this change is called a new creation; (2
   Cor. v. 17;) plainly implying, as a celebrated writer well expresses
   it, "that something must here be done in us, and for us, which cannot
   be done by us." Wherefore it is said, that the new man is renewed in
   knowledge after the image of him that created him: (Col. iii. 10:) and
   we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works: (Eph.
   ii. 10:) not to insist upon the great variety of parallel passages, in
   which the same thoughts are expressed almost in the very same words.
   But he indeed who would reckon up all the scriptures, both in the Old
   and New Testaments, which directly or indirectly refer to this, must
   transcribe a larger part of both than would be convenient to read at
   one time in a worshiping assembly. But we may further, by a very strong
   consequence, infer the doctrine I am now maintaining from those various
   passages of the sacred writers, in which,

   3. The increase of piety in a heart already regenerated, is spoken of
   as the work of God.

   Thus David, even when he felt himself disposed to the most vigorous
   prosecution of religion, solemnly declares his dependence upon
   continued Divine influences, to enable him to execute the holy purpose
   he was then most affectionately forming: I will run the way of thy
   commandments, says he, when thou shalt enlarge my heart, (Psal. cxix.
   32,) i. e. when thou shalt influence it with a steady principle of
   zeal, and with those devout passions which may make every branch of my
   duty easy and delightful. And the apostle Paul declares his persuasion
   that God would continue those gracious influences which he had already
   imparted: He that has begun a good work in you, will perform it until
   the day of Jesus Christ. Phil. i. 6. And when he speaks of the ardent
   desire with which Christians were aspiring towards a better world, he
   adds, He that hath wrought us for the self-same things is God. 2 Cor.
   v. 5. Thus also he ascribes his continued fidelity in the ministry to
   the grace of God that was with him, as being one that had obtained
   mercy of the Lord to be faithful: (1 Cor. vii. 25:) for by the grace of
   God, says he, I am what I am: and if I have labored more abundantly
   than others, it is not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 1
   Cor. xv. 10. On the same principle he acknowledges, that the success of
   Apollos in watering, as well as his own in planting, was to be referred
   to this, that God gave the increase in the one case as well as in the
   other. 1 Cor. iii. 6, 7. And he concludes his Epistle to the Hebrews
   with this remarkable prayer: The God of peace make you perfect in every
   good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in
   his sight, through Jesus Christ. Heb. iii. 31. But indeed, as every
   prayer that the apostles offer for any of their Christian brethren and
   friends, that they may grow in grace, might be urged for the
   illustration of this head, I choose rather to refer the rest to your
   own observation on this general hint, than to enter into a more
   particular enumeration. I shall only add, to complete the argument,

   4. That the scripture often declares the necessity as well as the
   reality of such influences, and refers the ruin of man to this
   circumstance, that God in his righteous judgment had withheld or
   withdrawn them.

   When Moses would upbraid the obstinacy of the Israelites, that all the
   profusion of wonders wrought for them in Egypt, and in the wilderness,
   had not produced any suitable impressions; so much was he accustomed to
   think of every thing good, in the moral, as well as in the natural
   world, as the gift of God, that he uses this remarkable expression: Yet
   the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and
   ears to hear, unto this day. Deut. xxix. 4. And our Lord, the propriety
   of whose expressions surely none can arraign, speaks to the same
   purpose, when adoring the Divine conduct with respect to the
   dispensation of saving light and gospel blessings, he says, I thank
   thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
   things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes;
   even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. Matt. xi. 25, 26.
   If some of the plainest and lowest of the people, who were in
   comparison to others but as little children, understood and received
   the gospel, while the learned men and politicians of the age despised
   it, God revealed it to the former, while he suffered the vail of
   prejudice to remain on the mind of the latter, though his Almighty hand
   could easily have removed it.

   Those other words of our Lord must not be omitted here, in which he
   says, No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath sent me
   draw him: (1 John vi. 44:) and what this drawing of the Father means,
   he himself has explained by saying, No man can come unto me, except it
   be given him of my Father; (Ver. 65;) and elsewhere he expresses it by
   learning of the Father; (Ver. 45;) all which must undoubtedly signify a
   Divine agency and influence on the mind. Nay, a more forcible
   expression than this is made use of by the evangelist John, where he
   takes notice of the unbelief of those that saw the miracles of Christ,
   therefore they could not believe, because Esaias said, he has blinded
   their eyes, and hardened their hearts: (John xii. 39, 40:) which is
   agreeable to that expression of the apostle Paul, he has mercy on whom
   he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth: (Rom. ix. 18:) a
   thought which the apostle pursues at large through the following
   verses.

   These, to be sure, are very emphatical scriptures: and though it is
   necessary to understand them in such a qualified sense as to make them
   consistent with other scriptures which charge men's destruction, not on
   any necessitating decree of God, but upon themselves and the abuse of
   their own faculties; yet still these expressions must stand for
   something; and in the most moderate sense that he can put upon them,
   they directly confirm what I have here brought them to prove. So that
   on the whole, the matter must come to this--That the cause of men's
   final and everlasting ruin may be referred in one view of it, to God's
   withholding those gracious influences, which if they had been imparted,
   would indeed have subdued the greatest perverseness; but his
   withholding these influences is not merely an arbitrary act, but the
   just punishment of men's wickedness; and of their obstinate folly in
   trifling with the means of his grace, and grieving his Spirit till he
   was provoked to withdraw. This thought, which I might largely prove to
   you to be a compendium of the scripture scheme, reconciles all; and any
   consequences drawn from one part of that scheme to the denial of the
   other, how plausible soever, must certainly be false.

   I hope what I have here said may be sufficient to fix a conviction in
   your judgments and consciences, that regeneration is ultimately to be
   referred to a Divine influence upon the soul: or, as the apostle
   expresses it in the text, that God saves us of his mercy, by the
   washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed
   on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.

   I shall conclude with two or three reflections, which, though so
   exceeding obvious, I shall touch upon, in regard to their great
   importance, without offering, as I might, to dilate on each of them at
   large.

   1. Let those who have experienced this divine change in their souls
   give God the glory of it.

   Perhaps there are many of you who may see peculiar reason to do it;
   perhaps you may be conscious to yourselves, that the arm of the Lord
   was remarkably revealed in conquering, every sensible opposition, and
   getting itself the victory, even when you seemed, as if you had been
   resolutely bent upon your own destruction, to struggle to the utmost
   against the operation of his grace on your soul. Others may perhaps
   have perceived the strength of the Divine agency in the slightness of
   the occasion, or in the weakness of the means by which he wrought;
   which indeed is often matter of astonishment to those that seriously
   reflect upon it. But whatever your inclinations may have appeared, and
   whatever means or instruments were used, give God the glory of all.

   If you have found yourselves, from your early years, inclined to attend
   to divine things, and susceptible of tender impressions from them, that
   attention and those impressions were to be resolved into this; that God
   prevented you with the blessings of his goodness. If you have enjoyed
   the most excellent public ordinances, even with all the concurrent
   advantages that the most pressing exhortations, and. the most edifying
   example of parents, ministers, and companions could give; it was Divine
   Providence that furnished you with those advantages, and Divine grace
   that added efficacy to them--else they had only served to display their
   own weakness, even where they might have appeared most powerful, and to
   illustrate that insensibility or obstinacy of heart which would have
   rendered you proof against all. You do well indeed to honor those whom
   God has blessed as the means of your spiritual edification: but if they
   think aright, it would grieve them to the very heart to have those
   applauses given, and those acknowledgments made to them, which are due
   to God alone. All they have done is so little that it deserves not the
   mention; and the greater attainments they have made in religion, the
   more cordially will they join with the holy apostle in saying, Neither
   is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that
   giveth the increase. 1 Cor. iii. 7.

   2. We may further infer, that they who attempt the conversion of
   sinners, should do it with an humble dependence on the co-operation of
   Divine grace.

   Otherwise they will probably find themselves fatally disappointed; and
   after their most skillful or most laborious attempts, they will
   complain that they have labored in vain, and spent their strength for
   nought; (Isa. xlix. 4;) and find reason to say, The bellows are burnt,
   and the lead is consumed of the fire, yet the dross is not taken away.
   Jer. vi. 29. A dependence upon God, in all the common affairs of life,
   becomes us as we are creatures; and it is most necessary that we
   should, in all our ways acknowledge him, as we expect or desire that he
   should direct or prosper our paths: (Prov. iii. 6:) but the greater the
   undertaking is, the more solemn should the acknowledgment of God be.

   Let me therefore especially recommend this to those who are coming
   forth as young officers in the army of Christ. See to it, my brethren,
   that in the name of your God you set up your banners; (Psal. xx. 5;)
   that you apply from time to time to your public work with a deep
   conviction upon your minds that no strength of reason will effectually
   convince, that no eloquence will effectually persuade, unless he that
   made men's hearts will plead his own cause, and bow those hearts in
   humble subjection. With these views, I have often known the feeblest
   attempts successful, and the meek and lowly have out of weakness been
   made strong; (Heb. xi. 34;) while for want of this, all the charms of
   composition and delivery have been at best but like the lovely song of
   one who has a pleasant voice, or the art of one that can play well on
   an instrument. Ezek. xxxiii. 32. It is those that honor God by the most
   cordial dependence upon him that he delighteth to honor: (1 Sam. ii.
   30:) and I will presume to say, that it is the inward conviction of
   this important truth, which I feel upon my soul while I am confirming
   it to you, that encourages me to hope, that this labor shall not be in
   vain in the Lord, (1 Cor. xv. 58,) but that a Divine blessing shall
   evidently attend what has already been delivered, and what shall
   further be spoken. Only let me conclude my present Discourse with this
   one necessary caution,

   3. That you do not abuse this doctrine of the necessity of Divine
   influences, which from the word of God, has been so abundantly
   confirmed.

   God does indeed act upon us, in order to produce this happy change: but
   he acts upon us in a manner suitable to our rational nature, and not as
   if we were mere machines. He saves us, as the scripture expresses it,
   by awaking us to save ourselves: (Acts ii. 40:) a new heart does he
   give us, and a new spirit does he put within us, (Ezek. xxxvi. 26,) to
   stir us up to be solicitous to make ourselves a new heart and a new
   spirit: (Ezek. xviii. 31:) he circumcises our heart to love him, (Deut.
   xxx. 6,) by engaging us to take away the foreskin of our hearts. Jer.
   iv. 4. You see the correspondency of the phrases, and it is of great
   importance that you attend to it. If any therefore say, "I will sit
   still, and attempt nothing for my own recovery, till God irresistibly
   compels me to it:" he seems as like to perish, as that man would be,
   who, seeing the house in flames about him, should not attempt to make
   his escape, till he felt himself moved by a miracle.

   Sirs, the dependence of the creature on God, though it be especially,
   yet it is not only, in spiritual affairs: it runs through all our
   interests and concerns. We as really depend upon his influence to
   stretch out our hands, as we do to raise our hearts towards him in
   prayer. Your fields could no more produce their fruit without his
   agency, than his word could, without it, become fruitful in your
   hearts: yet you plow and sow; and would look upon him as a madman, that
   upon this principle should decline it, urging, that no crop could be
   expected if God did not produce it; and that if he pleased to produce
   it, it would come up without any human labor. The argument is just the
   same in that case, as when men plead for the neglect of means or
   endeavors, from the reality and necessity of a divine concurrence. And
   if they apply this argument to the concerns of their souls, when they
   do not apply it to those of their bodies, it plainly shows, that they
   regard their bodies more than their souls; and that in pretending to
   make these excuses, they belie their conscience, and act against the
   secret conviction of their own heart. Such persons do not deserve to be
   disputed with, but rather should be solemnly admonished of the danger
   of such egregious trifling, where eternity is at stake.

   And sure I am, that it is offering a great affront to the memory of the
   blessed Paul, when men pretend to encourage themselves in this perverse
   temper from anything he has said. For when he gives us, as it were, the
   substance of all I have now been saying, in those comprehensive words,
   It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure, (Phil. ii. 13,) he is so far from mentioning it as an excuse
   for remissness and sloth, that he introduces it professedly in the very
   contrary view, as engaging us to exert ourselves with the utmost vigor
   in a dependence upon that Divine operation. And therefore, as he there
   expresses it, I say with him, Work out your own salvation with fear and
   trembling; and if you will not do it, you have reason to tremble in the
   prospect of a final condemnation from God, aggravated by your having
   thus irrationally and ungratefully abused the revelation of his grace.

DISCOURSE VIII

  OF THE VARIOUS METHODS OF THE DIVINE OPERATION IN THE PRODUCTION OF THIS
  SAVING CHANGE.

  1 Cor. xii. 6.

   There are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which
   worketh all in all.

   WHATEVER the original sense of these words was, and how peculiarly
   soever they may relate to the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, the
   whole tenor of this discourse will show with how much propriety they
   may, at least, be accommodated to the operations of his grace. I have
   proved to you in the last of these lectures, that wherever regeneration
   is produced, it is ultimately to be ascribed to a Divine agency; and
   though I cannot say it is equally important, yet I apprehend it may be
   both agreeable and useful to proceed,

   Fifthly, To survey the VARIETY OF METHODS which God is pleased to take
   in producing this happy change: or, to borrow the language of the text,
   to consider the diversity of operations, by which the same God, who
   worketh all in all, i. e. who produces all the virtues and graces of
   the Christian character, in some degree, in all his people, is pleased,
   according to his own wise and gracious purposes, to proceed in his
   agency, on those whom he regenerates and saves.

   And this survey will not be matter of mere curiosity, but may probably
   revive the hearts of some amongst you by the recollection of your own
   experience: and it may be a caution to others, who, for want of due
   compass and extent of thought and knowledge, are ready to argue, as if
   God had but one way to work on the human heart, and that one the
   particular manner by which he recovered them. Of this I shall speak
   more largely hereafter. In the mean time, I judged it necessary to
   premise this hint, to direct us as to the temper with which this
   discourse should be heard, as well as to the purpose to which it is to
   be improved.

   Now what I have to offer on this subject will be ranged under these
   three heads. There is a diversity and variety observable--in the
   time--the occasion--and the manner, of the Divine operations on the
   soul.

   I. There is an observable variety, as to the TIME of God's gracious
   operations on different persons.

   Some are called in their infancy:--others, and these perhaps the
   greatest part, are wrought upon in youth:--and some very few in the
   advance, and even in the decline of life.

   1. Some are wrought upon by Divine grace in their infancy.

   This is often the case; and I doubt not, but if parents were to do
   their duty, it would much more frequently be so. And it is an honor
   which God is pleased, in some instances, remarkably to confer on a good
   education; which is indeed so important a duty on one side, and so
   great a privilege on the other, that it is the less to be wondered at,
   that he so mercifully encourages Christian parents in the discharge of
   it: thus granting, as it were, an immediate reward for this labor of
   love. And I must here take the freedom, on my own observation, to say,
   that God seems especially to own the faithful endeavors of pious
   mothers in this respect. He has wisely and graciously given that sex a
   peculiar tenderness of address, and an easy and insinuating manner,
   which is admirably adapted to this great end, for which, no doubt, he
   especially intended it, that of conveying knowledge to children, and
   making tender impressions on their minds: and there is hardly any view
   in which the importance of the sex more evidently appears.

   We have encouragement to believe, there are a considerable number who
   are, as it were, sanctified from the womb, and in whom the seeds of
   Divine grace are sown, before they grow up to a capacity of
   understanding the public preaching of the word: a remark, which Mr.
   Baxter carries so far as to say, that he believes, "if the duties of
   religious education were conscientiously discharged, preaching would
   not be God's ordinary method of converting souls: but the greater part
   would be wrought upon before they were capable of entering into the
   design of a sermon." And indeed it seems to me, that children may early
   come to have some apprehensions of what is most important in religion.
   They may have a reverence for God, and a love for him, as that great
   Father who made them, and that kind Friend who gives them everything
   that they have: they may have a fear of doing anything that would
   displease him; and though it is not so easy for them to understand the
   doctrines peculiar to a Redeemer, yet when they hear of Christ as the
   Son of God, who came down from heaven to teach men and children the way
   thither; who loved them, and did them good every day, and at last died
   to deliver them from death and hell; their little hearts may well be
   impressed with such thoughts as these, and they may find a growing
   desire to be instructed in what Christ is, and what he taught and did,
   and to do what shall appear to be his will. And wherever this is the
   prevailing disposition, it seems to me that the seeds of holiness are
   sown in that soul, though but small proficiency may be made in
   knowledge, and though the capacities for service be very low.

   I will add, that some remarkably pertinent and solid things, which
   little children have said concerning religion, seem to me plainly to
   evidence, that they have been, in many instances, under some uncommon
   teachings of the Divine Spirit: and it seems perfectly suitable to the
   genius of Christianity, that in this sense God should ordain strength
   out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, (Psal. viii. 2,) and should
   reveal to them what he has suffered to be hidden from the wise and
   prudent. (Matt. xi. 25.) Nor can I suppose it hard for any, who have
   been for a considerable time acquainted with the state of religion in
   Christian societies, to recollect various instances, in which persons
   thus taught of God, who have heard, and known, and loved the
   scriptures, and delighted in ordinances and serious discourse from
   their childhood, have been, in some measure, like Samuel, Obadiah,
   Jeremiah, Josiah, and Timothy, honored with eminent usefulness in the
   church, and have happily filled some of its most important stations of
   service. Almost every age has afforded instances of this; and I am
   persuaded, many are now growing up amongst us, who will be instances of
   it in ages yet to come.

   2. Others, and these perhaps the greatest part of real Christians, are
   wrought upon in their youthful days.

   Many parents are very deficient in a due care to cultivate the infant
   minds of their little ones; or the feeble and general impressions then
   made are, perhaps, worn out and lost, in the growing vanities of
   childhood and youth. They begin to be drawn away by evil inclinations
   and examples, and by the delusions of a flattering world, which then
   puts on its most attractive charms, to gain upon their inexperienced
   minds: and hereupon they follow after vanity, and become vain: (2 Kings
   xvii. 15:) of the rock which begat them, they grow unmindful, and
   forget the God that formed them. Deut. xxxii. 18. But by one method or
   another, God often stops them in this dangerous career; and awakening
   ordinances, or more awakening providences, bring them to a stand, and
   turn them the contrary way. The terrors of the Lord set themselves in
   array against them; (Job. vi. 4;) or his mercy melts their souls, and
   they yield themselves its willing captives. They consecrate their
   hearts, warm as they are with youthful vigor, to be the sacrifices of
   Divine love, and enter, it may be, very early into the bonds of God's
   covenant: and so prove such a seed to serve him, as is accounted to the
   Lord for a most honorable and useful generation. Psal. xxii. 30.
   Blessed be God, I speak to many who know this by experience! By far the
   greater part of those who have been admitted to your communion, since I
   settled among you, have been, as I apprehend, under the age of
   twenty-four years: and several of those, who were farther advanced in
   life when they first approached the table of the Lord, had been brought
   to real religion in their much earlier years; though particular
   circumstances, or some mistaken apprehensions, might prevent their
   giving up their names publicly to the Lord, so soon as they might, and
   as they ought to have done it.

   3. Some few are wrought upon by Divine grace in the advance, and even
   in the decline of life.

   I confess that the number of these is comparatively small: and it is
   not to be wondered at, that it is so. They are not many who arrive at
   what can properly be called old age; and of them but a very
   inconsiderable part are then brought to anything which looks like a
   saving change. Nor shall we be much surprised at this, if we consider
   the inveterate nature of bad habits, which render it almost as hard for
   them that are accustomed to do evil, to learn to do good, as it is for
   the Ethiopian to Change his skin, or the leopard his spots. Jer. xiii.
   23. To such a degree are prejudices riveted in the mind, so insensible
   is it rendered of tender and generous impressions, so cold are the
   affections, and the habits, if the phrase may be allowed, so rigid,
   that, humanly speaking, there is much less probability of their being
   impressed with religion, than there was when they were in the bloom of
   life; notwithstanding all the seeming advantages which might arise from
   riper reason, deeper experience, and a nearer prospect of eternity. In
   all these things, it is in vain to reason against observation of fact,
   since we evidently see how uncommon a thing it is, for persons to be
   awakened and reformed in old age; especially if they have been educated
   in the principles of religion, and have made a florid profession of it
   in their youth--from which they have afterwards apostatized, out of a
   love to the wealth or honors of the world, or a relish for sensual
   delights. Such persons generally live and die monuments of Divine
   wrath, bearing, as it were, in characters dreadfully legible, the sad
   inscription of those, who having forsaken God, are finally forsaken of
   him. They appear as dry trees, twice dead, and fit for nothing but to
   be plucked up by the roots, and cast into the fire. Jude ver. 12; John
   xv. 16.

   Nevertheless, to prove the infinite energy and sovereignty of Divine
   grace, God is sometimes pleased to work even on such. He touches the
   rock which has stood for ages unmoved, and the waters flow forth: he
   says to the dry bones, Live, and they obey; they are clothed with
   beauty, they are animated with life, and stand up as with the vigor of
   a renewed youth, to pursue the labors of religion, and to fight the
   battles of the Lord. Ezek. xxxviii. 20. Such instances, in which aged
   sinners have been thus wrought upon, I have read and heard; though, I
   grieve to say it, I can recollect very few, if any, that have occurred
   to me within the sphere of my own personal observation and
   acquaintance.

   But besides this variety in the time, there is also,

   II. An observable diversity, in the OCCASION, which Divine grace takes
   to operate upon different persons.

   The occasions are indeed so various, that it would be impossible to
   enumerate them; I shall however just touch on some of the chief.

   And here I might particularly consider a religious education in this
   view, and that daily converse with pious friends, which is of course
   connected with it. But though perhaps there may be no occasion more
   considerable in itself, and none that has been more eminently honored
   of God; yet it is proper to waive it here, as having been mentioned
   under the former head.

   I proceed therefore further to observe, that some are wrought upon by
   the word of God; others by some remarkable providences; some by little
   incidents, which, inconsiderable as they seem in themselves, grow
   memorable by the noble effects they are made to produce: and others by
   secret and immediate impressions of God upon their spirits, which
   cannot be resolved into any external cause, or any visible occasion at
   all.

   1. The administration of Divine ordinances, and especially the word of
   God and prayer, is an occasion, which he most frequently takes to work
   upon men's hearts by his grace.

   I do not mention the administration of the sacraments upon this
   occasion; because, though they have so noble and effectual a tendency
   to improve men's minds in piety, and to promote Christian edification;
   yet I do not remember to have heard of any instance, in which they have
   been the means of men's conversion; which is the less to be wondered
   at, as they were appointed for a very different end.

   There are many, however, that have been wrought upon in prayer, as
   there are many things concur in this to awaken and impress the mind.
   The solemn acknowledgments then made of the Divine perfections, the
   praises offered to his tremendous Majesty, the deep and humble
   confession of our various and aggravated guilt in his holy presence,
   the lamentations over it, the importunate pleadings for a variety of
   blessings both for time and eternity; in a word, all the overflowings
   of pious affections in the breast of him that leads the devotion, and
   especially the earnest entreaties then offered for unconverted sinners,
   the genuine expressions of an undissembled apprehension of their
   danger, and the fervent breathings after Divine grace, to be
   communicated to them for their spiritual life: all these things, I say,
   and many more, which occur in prayer, when it is managed aright, may,
   by the Divine blessing, be singularly useful. And I am well assured,
   there have been happy instances, in which, while God's people have yet
   been speaking to him on this head, he has graciously heard, and
   signally answered them. Isa. lxv. 24.

   But the reading, and especially the preaching of the word of God, is
   the grand occasion and instrument in the conversion of souls. Of his
   own will he begets them with' the word of truth: (Jam. i. 18:) and it
   is admirably suited to those saving impressions which it is intended to
   make on the heart, being quick and powerful, and sharper than any
   two-edged sword. Heb. iv. 12. It was while Paul was preaching that the
   Lord opened Lydia's heart, so that she attended to the things which
   were spoken by him: (Acts xvi. 14:) and it was while Peter was thus
   employed, that such vast multitudes were pricked in their hearts, and
   said to him, and to the rest of the apostles present, Men and brethren,
   what shall we do? Acts ii. 37? And I am well persuaded, that various
   and lamentable as the instances are, in which men stop their ears and
   harden their hearts against it, God does not even to this day leave it
   without witness: but the terrors of the Lord, as displayed by his
   faithful ministers, have subdued their thousands, and the riches of his
   grace their ten thousands, when illustrated by those who have not only
   heard, but have themselves tasted of their sweetness. The preaching of
   the cross may indeed to them that perish be foolishness; but blessed be
   his name who died upon it, there is still a happy remnant, to whom it
   appears to be the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 1 Cor. i. 18,
   24.

   Evangelical subjects, when opened with perspicuity, and enforced with
   vigor and tenderness, by those that have experienced the transforming
   energy of them on their own hearts, and desire above all things, to be
   wise to win the souls of others, (Prov. xi. 30,) are generally the
   occasion of producing the most immediate and the most important change;
   as I doubt not, but many now present have seen and felt. And the
   observation of every year of life convinces me more and more that they
   who desire to be signally instrumental in this good work--this work of
   all others the most benevolent and important--must, in the account of a
   vain world, become fools, that they may be wise. 1 Cor. iii. 18. How
   contemptuously soever it may be fashionable to treat such preaching, we
   must make these subjects familiar to our hearers, and must treat them
   with all plainness of speech, and all seriousness of address, or we
   shall generally labor in vain, and spend our strength for nought. Isa.
   xlix. 4.

   Would to God, that the teachers of our Israel may consider the
   importance of it, and grow wise by such experiments as these! that they
   may act the part of prudent physicians, who prescribe the medicines
   they find in fact most useful, and not those concerning which the
   finest speculations may be framed. Till then, whatever their learning,
   politeness, and parade may be, it cannot be expected that our health
   should be generally recovered; but we are like to continue, what we
   have long been, a vicious people, amidst the finest encomiums of
   virtue, that are anywhere to be found: nor will there be much room to
   wonder, if some of its most eloquent advocates should appear, even in
   their own practice, insensible of those charms which they so gracefully
   recommend to others, and sink in their character below those heathen
   moralists, whom they may choose to imitate, rather than Christ and his
   apostles. Nevertheless, I am persuaded, that if God intend mercy for us
   as a people, he will support among us a succession of those who shall
   dispense his truths in such a manner, as he has generally chosen to
   honor with success. But though the greater part of sincere converts are
   won by these, I am to add,

   2. That remarkable providences, whether merciful or afflictive, are
   occasions which God takes to work upon the hearts of many others.

   When ordinary means have long been attended in vain, God perhaps
   interposes, by other more peculiar and signal methods, to pluck the
   trifling and lethargic sinner as a firebrand out of the burning. Amos
   iv. 11.

   Sometimes remarkable mercies and deliverances accomplish the work. An
   appearance of God in their favor, when they are conscious to themselves
   that they are the unworthiest of all his creatures, shall shame and
   melt them, and powerfully prevail on their minds to turn unto the Lord,
   who daily loads them with his benefits; (Ps. lxviii. 19;) and thus
   seems, in more senses than one, to send from heaven to save them, and
   to draw them out of many waters, in which they had otherwise been lost.
   Ps. xviii. 16.

   But we more frequently see, that afflictions are the means of
   performing this happy work. By a gracious severity God is pleased to
   lay hold on many, and to give them reason to bless the hand, which,
   though by a rough motion, delivers them from the flames that were
   kindling around them, and shows the Lord to be merciful to them. Gen.
   xix. 16. Like Jonah in the ship, they are awakened by a storm to call
   upon their God: (John i. 6:) like Manasseh, they are taken among the
   thorns, and laid in fetters, that they may be brought to know the Lord:
   (2 Chron. xxxiii. 11, 13:) like the jailer, they are shaken with an
   earthquake, and trembling and astonished they fall down, and inquire
   what they shall do to be saved. Acts xvi. 26-30. The terrifying fear of
   the approach of death, or the distressing weight of some calamity,
   which threatens every moment to swallow them up in destruction, rouses
   their consciences to an attention to those divine truths which they had
   long forgotten, and opens those records of guilt which they had
   studiously sealed up.

   And there seems to be no affliction by which God more frequently works
   upon men than by sickness. When he weakens their capacity for the
   business of life, and spoils their relish for its enjoyments; when he
   confines them to their chambers, or even to their beds, and makes their
   chain straight and heavy; (Lam. iii. 7;) when he threatens to take them
   away in the midst of their days, (Psal. xii. 24,) to deprive them of
   the residue of their years, (Isa. xxiii. 10,) and immediately to bring
   them before that awful tribunal, for which they know, in their own
   consciences, they are so ill prepared: then do we often see the
   accomplishment of that observation which Elihu made so many ages ago;
   He chasteneth a man with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his
   bones with strong pain, so that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul
   dainty meat: his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen: and his
   bones, that were not seen, stick out; yea, his soul draweth near to the
   grave, and his life to the destroyers: but sending him an interpreter,
   one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness, then he is
   gracious to him, and saith, in a spiritual as well as literal sense,
   Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom. Job
   xxxiii. 19-24. Blessed be God, instances of this kind have been known
   among us, in which the sickness of the body has wrought the cure of the
   soul, under the conduct of the great Physician of both; and so has
   proved eminently to the glory of God, and the good of those who, for a
   while, have been in heaviness. 1 Pet. i. 6.

   Yet it must be acknowledged, that, in other instances, the remorse
   which a man expresses upon a sick bed, and in the near views of
   eternity, proves but like that of some condemned malefactor, who, when
   he has obtained a pardon, throws off all those appearances of
   repentance with which he had once deceived himself, and perhaps
   deceived others too, and plunges himself anew into capital crime; it
   may be, into crimes for which he afterwards suffers death, without
   those compunctions of conscience which he before felt, being hardened
   by a return into sin, attended with such dreadful aggravations. This
   has been the case of many; and I pray God it may not be thus with any
   of you.

   But if there be any among you that were once under powerful awakenings;
   and that have cried out of terrors on every side; (Job xviii. 11;) that
   have confessed your sins, it may be, with greater freedom, and a more
   particular detail of circumstances, than the minister who attended you
   could have desired, and have resolved against them with all the
   appearances of the most determined purpose; and yet, after all, have
   returned with the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire: (2
   Pet. ii. 22:) such have peculiar reason to be alarmed. and terrified.
   Every day of Divine patience toward such is astonishing. And if to all
   this have been added the returns of danger, and signal interposition of
   Providence for your deliverance, and yet there be no kindly impressions
   of penitence and gratitude on your hearts, they who know the
   particulars of the case, must surely look upon you with horror as well
   as with wonder: for what can one imagine of such, but that they are
   given over by God to a darkness, which nothing but the flames of hell
   can enlighten, and a hardness, which nothing can penetrate but the
   sharpness of unquenchable fire, and the gnawings of the never-dying
   worm?

   But to return from a digression, into which compassion towards such a
   deplorable case has insensibly led me, I would farther observe, that as
   these various interpositions of a remarkable Providence are often the
   means of working saving impressions on men's minds, so,

   3. God is sometimes pleased to overrule little and inconsiderable
   incidents in life, as the occasion of accomplishing this happy change.

   As the treasure of the Gospel was at first put into earthen vessels,
   that the excellency of the power might appear to be of God, and not of
   man; (2 Cor. iv. 6;) so God to make his own praise glorious, (Psal.
   lxvi. 2,) is sometimes pleased to produce the most important effects,
   by causes which seem in themselves least considerable. And it is
   astonishing to see from how small and seemingly unpromising a seed this
   plant of paradise springs up, and with how little cultivation too in
   some instances, after Paul had long attempted in vain to plant, and
   Apollos to water. 1 Cor. iii. 6, 7. A few lines in the Bible, or any
   other good book, perhaps taken up by chance, shall be the instrument;
   and a passage, on which the eye glances without expectation or design,
   shall strike to the heart, like an arrow from the bow of God
   himself--after quivers of the most pointed and polished shafts have
   been exhausted in vain, though such shafts were most skillfully aimed,
   and most vigorously discharged. In other instances, a word dropped in
   conversation, and that perhaps no way remarkable either for its spirit
   or propriety, shall do that which the most solemn ordinances have not
   been capable of doing: an important encouragement, by the way, to
   abound in religious discourse, which God has sometimes been pleased to
   honor as the happy means of saving a soul from death, and laying a
   foundation for the delights of an everlasting friendship with those who
   have been so recovered.

   4. Sometimes this great work is accomplished by secret and immediate
   impressions from God upon the mind, without any visible means,
   instruments, or occasions at all.

   These things do not frequently happen; nor does it seem fit they
   should, lest any should be encouraged to expect them in the neglect of
   the appointed means. Nevertheless, it is plain, in fact, that God is
   sometimes pleased to go out of the common way; and his mighty hand is
   to be acknowledged in it. The reasons are known to himself; and the
   praise is humbly to be ascribed to him who giveth not an account of any
   of his matters. Job. xxxiii. 13.

   It is not, to be sure, so common now as it was in the days of Elihu,
   that God should speak to men in a dream, or seal instruction to them in
   slumberings on their bed; (Job xxxiii. 15, 16;) yet I have myself known
   several who have ascribed their first religious awakenings to some
   awful dream, in which the solemnity of the judgment day, or a view of
   the invisible world, has been represented to them with unspeakable
   terror; and others, to whom, when they have waked in the night, some
   words of scripture have occurred with such power, that they have not
   been able to divert their thoughts to anything else; and that when they
   themselves have not certainly known whether they were in the Bible or
   not.

   I have known those that, in the circle of their vain companions, and in
   the midst of their sensual delights, have been struck to the very heart
   with some such scripture as this: to be carnally minded is death: (Rom.
   viii. 6:) or such a text as this has, on a sudden, darted into their
   minds; The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
   and unrighteousness of men. Rom. i. 18. Such passages have seemed to
   ring and thunder in their ears, till the sound of their music, and the
   noise of their mirth have been quite overpowered, so that they have
   been driven from their revels to their knees, and have returned no more
   into the paths of the destroyer.

   Yea, to add no more instances of this kind, I have known those of
   distinguished genius, polite manners, and great experience in human
   affairs, who, after having outgrown all the impressions of a religious
   education; after having been hardened, rather than subdued, by the most
   singular mercies, even various, repeated, and astonishing deliverances,
   which have appeared to themselves no less than miraculous; after having
   lived for years without God in the world, notoriously corrupt
   themselves, and laboring to the utmost to corrupt others; have been
   stopped on a sudden in the full career of their sin, and have felt such
   rays of the Divine presence, and of redeeming love, darting in upon
   their minds, almost like lightning from heaven, as have at once roused,
   overpowered, and transformed them; so that they have come out of their
   chambers with an irreconcilable enmity to those vices, to which, when
   they entered them, they were the tamest and most abandoned slaves; and
   have appeared, from that very hour, the votaries, the patrons, the
   champions of religion; and after a course of the most resolute
   attachment to it, in spite of all the reasonings, or the railleries,
   the importunities, or the reproaches of its enemies, they have
   continued to this day some of its brightest ornaments: a change which I
   behold with equal wonder and delight, and which, if a nation should
   join in deriding it, I would adore as the finger of God. [9]

   In mentioning these things thus publicly, I do indeed take an uncommon
   freedom, which some may perhaps censure; but so far as human testimony
   can give an assurance of truth, I may justly say, that I speak what I
   know, and testify what, in its genuine and powerful effects, I have
   myself seen. John iii. 11. And since the possibility of abusing such
   condescensions of Divine mercy did not prevent their being granted, I
   can not think it ought to engage me to be silent, when so natural an
   opportunity offered of declaring them, to the glory of him who worketh
   all things according to the counsel of his own will. Ephes. i. 11. Yet
   I must repeat the caution which I before suggested, that it would be
   madness for any to neglect God's appointed means of operation, on
   presumption that they shall be added to the small list of those who
   have been such uncommon and astonishing trophies of the efficacy and
   sovereignty of Divine grace.

   These remarks must for the present suffice, with regard to the various
   occasions by which God works upon men's minds. [10] And I hope you will
   excuse me, if in illustrating some of them, I have a little anticipated
   some things which might have been mentioned under the third head, in
   which I proposed,

   III. To consider some varieties observable in the manner in which
   Divine grace operates on the mind.

   And this variety, by the way, will be observable in many instances
   where the occasions are in general the same. Thus among those that are
   awakened by the word of God, or by his providence, some are shaken by
   strong terrors, some are melted into deep sorrows; others are
   astonished, as it were, and captivated at once, by the discovery of the
   love of God in Christ, and others are led on by such gentle and gradual
   impressions, that they can hardly recollect any remarkable circumstance
   at all relating to the manner in which this blessed work was begun, or
   conducted in their souls.

   1. Some converts are awakened by strong terrors.

   It is obvious, that conviction of sin, in some degree or other, is
   absolutely necessary to make way for the entrance of the gospel into
   the soul. But the degrees are various in different persons; and as for
   those of whom we now speak, God reproves them aloud and sets their sins
   in order before them, (Psal. 1. 21,) marshals them in dreadful array,
   as the expression imports; so that they seem like defenceless criminals
   surrounded by a host of enemies, whose weapons are raised for their
   destruction. Yea, God himself, the great, the terrible, the eternal,
   and omnipotent God, seems to set them up as a mark for those arrows,
   (Lam. iii. 12,) the poison of which drinketh up their spirits: (Job.
   vi. 4:) and, as he himself expresses it, He is unto them as a bear or a
   lion, ready to tear and rend the very caul of their heart. Hos. xiii.
   8.

   They come, as it were, to the trembling and terrifying Mount Sinai, to
   blackness, and darkness, and tempest. Heb. xii. 18. The conviction of
   guilt is attended with such a sense of the demerit of sin, as fills
   them with horror and astonishment, and engages them to wish in the
   bitterness of their souls, that they had never been born. They are left
   for a time, and that perhaps for weeks and months, to be, as it were,
   deafened with the loud thunders of the law; a dreadful sound, as
   Eliphaz expresses it, is in their ears, (Job. xv. 21,) even the
   sentence of their own damnation; and the awful curse of an almighty,
   sin-avenging God comes into their bowels like water, and like oil into
   their bones. Psal. cix. 18.

   They are filled with such deep remorse for their past sins, that they
   verily think no iniquity was ever like theirs, and that no punishment
   will be like theirs. They hardly see a glimmering of hope that they
   shall obtain deliverance, but expect, in a very little while, to be
   sealed up under wrath, if they are not already so. When they bear the
   offers and the promises of the Gospel, they can apply none of them to
   themselves, and find comfort in none: but every threatening and every
   curse of the book of God seems to have been written as their intended
   portion. And thus, perhaps, they continue for weeks or for months
   together, expecting every day and every night that destruction from
   God, which is now a terror to them. (Job xxxi. 23,) should utterly
   swallow them up, and leave them neither root nor branch, neither
   comfort nor hope. Mal. iv. 1. The law is a schoolmaster to bring them
   to Christ, (Gal. iii. 24,) and it scourges them with the most rigorous
   discipline; yea, the infernal lion roars over them, though he is not
   permitted to devour them: he particularly terrifies them when they
   think of approaching God, as if they were to meet with some peculiar
   danger there, where alone they can find their relief: or, if they do in
   broken accents utter their prayer before God, it seems to be shut out,
   (Lam. iii. 8,) and they are apprehensive that it is turned into sin.
   Psal. cix. 7. Yet there is one thing to be observed in the midst of
   this scene of horror, and it is a circumstance of great importance,
   that they justify God when he seems most inexorable, and subscribe to
   that sentence as righteous which dooms them to eternal ruin.

   2. Others are melted into deep sorrows.

   Their eyes run down with tears; and they are ready to wish that their
   head were waters, and their eyes fountains, that they might continue to
   weep day and night. Jer. ix. 1, 18. They see the evil of sin, and the
   misery to which it has reduced them, in a most deplorable view; and it
   may be, while those described under the former head are ready to
   tremble because they can not weep; these are ready to weep because they
   cannot tremble. They lament, among other things, the want of those
   strong horrors which some have felt: they cry out, "Woe is me! for l am
   undone; (Isa. vi. 5;) I have destroyed myself, and in myself my help is
   not found." Hos. xiii. 9.

   It may be, indeed, a considerable time before they can persuade
   themselves there is any help for them even in God. They know there is
   help in him through Christ for penitent and believing sinners: but they
   cannot easily be convinced that they believe, because they do not feel
   that confident trust which some others have much sooner been brought
   to; and they are afraid, lest whatever they experience, which looks
   like repentance, should be only the false appearance of it, proceeding
   from mere self-love and a natural dread of future misery. They dwell
   perpetually on the dark side of things: they read over the catalogue of
   their iniquities again and again, and attend to those passages in which
   the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against every kind and degree
   of sin; (Rom. i. 18;) while they are slow of heart to admit those
   reviving consolations which the various rich and precious promises of
   the Gospel are so admirably well calculated to administer.

   The state of such souls, when they are first savingly enlightened, is
   like that of the earth, when fogs and mists have vailed the face of the
   sun after it is risen. But it very often happens, with respect to such
   souls, that when these mists are at length dispersed, a very bright and
   cheerful day opens: they are comforted by the warmer beams of the Sun
   of Righteousness, according to the hours in which they have been
   beclouded, and are made glad according to the days in which they were
   afflicted: (Psal. xc. 15:) and going on to fear the Lord, and to obey
   the voice of his servant, though they have long walked in darkness, and
   seen no light, they are at length encouraged by his Spirit enforcing
   the exhortations of his word, to trust in the name of the Lord, and
   stay themselves upon their God. Isa. 1. 10.

   3. Some are captivated with astonishing and delightful views of the
   love of God in Christ.

   There is always, as we observed before, in the awakened soul, some
   conviction of sin and apprehension of danger; nevertheless, there are
   instances in which God heals almost as soon as he wounds, and speaks
   peace almost as soon as he speaks trouble. He graciously shortens, to
   some souls, the pangs of the new birth, and gives them beauty for
   ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the
   spirit of heaviness. Isa. lxi. 3. The news of salvation by the blood,
   and righteousness, and grace of Christ, is received with so thankful a
   sense, with so joyful a compliance, that the soul, feeling beyond all
   doubt the cordial sincerity with which it embraces the offer, is filled
   with joy unspeakable, and full of glory: (1 Pet. i. 8:) the heart does
   magnify the Lord, and the spirit rejoices in God the Saviour. Luke i.
   46, 47.

   This was remarkably the case of the jailer, who in the very night in
   which he was converted, that same night in which the foundation of his
   house had been shaken, and his own soul too shaken, by an earthquake,
   so that he had endeavored to lay violent hands on himself: yet, I say,
   that very night, before the day appeared, having been directed to
   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, that he might be saved, and been
   enabled, by Divine grace to comply with the exhortation, it is added
   concerning him, that he rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
   Acts xvi. 34. Thus too the Thessalonians, though they received the word
   in much affliction, and ran the risk of losing their possessions and
   their lives in adhering to it, yet received it with joy of the Holy
   Ghost. 1 Thes. i. 6. And though I cannot say this is God's most
   ordinary way of' dealing, and though I fear the counterfeit appearance
   of such a, work as this often leaves men in the number of those whom
   our Lord represents by stony ground hearers; (Matt. xiii. 20, 21;) yet
   it is certain, some instances of this kind are still to be found. But
   then I must observe, this is a joy attended with the deepest humility,
   and animates the soul to the most ardent and affectionate resolution of
   walking worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being strengthened with
   all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and
   long-suffering with joyfulness. Col. i. 10, 11.

   4. Others--and these perhaps the greatest part of such as are
   religiously educated--are led on by such gentle and insensible degrees,
   that they can hardly recollect any remarkable circumstances that have
   attended their conversion, nor can certainly fix on the particular time
   of it.

   God is sometimes, in the preceding instances, in the whirlwind, the
   earthquake, and the fire; but he is also frequently in the still small
   voice. 1 Kings xix. 11, 12. The operations of the Holy Spirit on the
   soul are often, and perhaps generally, of such a nature, that it is
   difficult exactly to distinguish them from the rational exercise of our
   own thoughts, because the Spirit operates by suggesting rational views
   of things, and awakening rational affections. For whatever some have
   vainly and dangerously insinuated, nothing is so rational as the
   sentiments and temper which prevail in renewed souls, and to which it
   is the work of God's regenerating Spirit to bring them.

   These operations, where there is a religious education, often begin
   very early: but then, in some degree, the impressions wear off from the
   weak and flexible mind; and perhaps there are various instances in
   which they alternately revive and decay again. And this vicissitude of
   affectionate applications to religion under moving ordinances,
   afflictions, or deliverances, and of backslidings and remissness in it,
   with respect to many, may be permitted to continue for a long time. At
   length, under the various methods of Providence and Grace, the soul
   attains to greater steadiness, and a more habitual victory over the
   remains of indwelling sin: but it may be exceeding hard, and perhaps
   absolutely impossible, to determine concerning some remarkable scenes
   through which it has passed, whether such a one in particular, perhaps
   the last which strikes the memory, were the season of its new birth; or
   whether it were merely a recovery from such a degree of negligence and
   remissness, as may possibly be consistent with real religion, and be
   found in a regenerate soul.

   These balancings of backsliding and recovery often occasion very great
   perplexity; and such sort of converts are frequently much discouraged,
   because they cannot give the history of their religious experiences in
   so clear and distinct a manner as others: and particularly, because
   they have not passed through such violent terrors and agitations of
   mind as many, who were perhaps once sunk into much deeper degeneracy
   have done. Nevertheless, where there is a consciousness of an
   undissembled love to God, an unreserved devotedness to his service, a
   cordial trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and a sincere affection to
   mankind in general, and especially to those of the household of faith,
   a man ought not to perplex himself on this account. For as every man
   knows he was born into the world, by a consciousness that he now lives
   and acts here, though it is impossible he should remember anything of
   the time or circumstances in which he was first introduced into it; so
   may a Christian be assured, that some way or another he was born of the
   Spirit, if he can trace its genuine fruits and efficacious influences
   in a renewed heart and life.

   I have thus laid down several particulars. which appeared to me
   important, in order to illustrate that diversity which is observable in
   the methods of the Divine operations on the heart; and they will
   naturally lead us to these three reflections, with which I shall
   conclude my present Discourse. Let us not make our own experiences a
   standard for others,--nor the experiences of others a standard for
   ourselves;--nor let us be unwilling, in a prudent manner, to
   communicate our spiritual experiences to each other.

   1. Let us not make our own experiences a standard for others.

   Let us remember that there is, as we have heard, a diversity of
   operations; and that many a person may be a dear child of God, who was
   not born just with those circumstances which attended our own
   regeneration. Others may not so particularly have discerned the time,
   the occasion, the progress of the change; they may not have felt all
   that we have felt, either in the way of extraordinary terror or
   extraordinary comfort; and yet, perhaps, may equal, or even exceed us
   in that holy temper, to which it was the great intention of our
   Heavenly Father, by one method or another, to bring all his children.
   Nay, I will add, that Christians of a very amiable and honorable
   character may express themselves but in a dark, and something of an
   improper manner, concerning the doctrine of regeneration, and may, in
   conscience, scruple the use of some phrases relating to it, which we
   judge to be exceeding suitable; and yet, that very scruple which
   displeases us may proceed from a. reverence for God and truth, and from
   such a tenderness of heart as is the effect of his renewing grace. We
   should therefore be very cautious how we judge each other, and take
   upon us to reject those whom perhaps God has received.

   I remember good Dr. Owen, whose candor was, in many respects, very
   remarkable, carries this so far, as somewhere to say, "that some may,
   perhaps, have experienced the saving influences of the Holy Spirit on
   their hearts, who do not in words acknowledge the necessity, or even
   the reality of those influences." Judging men's hearts, and judging
   their states, is a work for which we are so ill qualified, that we have
   reason to be exceeding thankful it is not assigned to us. And when we
   are entering into such an examination of their character, as our duty
   may in some particular circumstances seem to require, we should be very
   solicitous that we do not lay down arbitrary and precarious rules. It
   seems, indeed, that so far as we can learn it, we may more safely judge
   by their present temper and conduct, than by the history of anything
   which has formerly passed in their minds.

   And let me add it as a necessary caution here, that they who never felt
   any of the extraordinary emotions of mind, which have been described
   under some former heads, but have been brought to religion by less
   observable methods, perhaps by calm, rational views of it--of whom I
   believe there are great numbers--should be very cautious that they do
   not rashly censure such things as I have now been representing, as if
   they were mere enthusiasm. I can not but think this a criminal limiting
   the Holy One of Israel, (Psal. lxxviii. 41,) and fear it will be found
   a boldness highly displeasing to him, and very injurious to the souls
   of those who allow themselves in it, and of others too, if they be such
   as are employed in the ministerial work: not now to insist on what, in
   comparison of this, is but a small matter, the apparent rudeness and
   petulance of contradicting facts so well attested as many of this kind
   have been, and running counter to the solid effects which such
   impressions have produced. The rashness which prevails under different
   forms among men of the most opposite sentiments, is too obvious; but if
   we would give ourselves leave calmly to weigh and consider matters, our
   spirits would be rendered on all sides more moderate, and many harsh
   and hasty censures would be suspended, which at present prove very
   little more than the ignorance, pride, and folly of those that pass
   them.

   2. Let us not make the experiences of others a standard for ourselves.

   This is frequently the case, and especially with those who are
   naturally of an humble and tender temper; for whose peace and comfort
   therefore one can not but be peculiarly solicitous. Having heard of
   some extraordinary experiences of others, they are ready to imagine,
   because they can trace nothing correspondent to these in their own
   minds, that they are utter strangers to real regeneration, and have
   nothing more than such religious notions and forms, as natural men may
   easily learn of each other.

   But what I have now been saying of the variety of the Divine operations
   on the heart, affords a solid answer to such scruples, when they arise
   in a pious mind. Reflect, on this occasion, how it is in the works of
   nature: there we know that God works in all, so that he is the life and
   existence of the whole creation; and yet, as an excellent writer
   expresses it, "He alone seems not to work.'' His agency is so invisible
   and secret, that did not reason and scripture join to teach it, one
   might live a great many years in the world without knowing anything
   more, than that such and such effects are produced by correspondent
   second causes: though in strict propriety of speech they are no causes
   at all, but owe all their efficacy to the Divine presence and
   operation. Sense tells us that the sun enlightens the earth, and warms
   it; that the rain waters it, the seeds produce vegetables, and the
   animals continue their proper race; but that God is the Father of
   lights, (Jam. i. 17,) that he has prepared the light and the sun:
   (Psal. lxxiv. 16;) that he visits the earth, and causes rain to descend
   into the furrows thereof, (Ps. lxv. 9, 10,) so as to make the grass to
   grow for cattle, and corn and herb for the service of man; (Psal. civ.
   14;) that he sends forth his Spirit, and the animal race is created,
   and the face of the earth renewed; (Psal. civ. 30;) this, I say, is
   what multitudes of the human race are not aware of; because in all
   these things he acts in a gentle, stated, and regular manner, and
   employs inferior agents as the instruments of his providence. And just
   thus gentle, silent, and regular are the influences of his Spirit upon
   men's souls; and it is often impossible exactly to distinguish them
   from the teachings of parents and ministers, and from those reflections
   which seem to spring from our own minds, though it is he that gives us
   counsel, while our reins instruct us in our secret musings, (Psal. xvi.
   7,) and that teaches us to profit by the lessons which others give us.

   Be not therefore surprised, and be not dejected, though you cannot
   assign the place, the time, the manner, in which your conversion began;
   and though you are strangers to the terrors, the sorrows, or the
   transports of joy, which you have heard one and another express. The
   wind bloweth where it listeth, and the Spirit dispenses his influences
   where and when, and in what measure and degree he pleases; but while
   the way and manner of his operation may be secret and unknown, the
   effects of it are sensible and evident; and as with regard to the wind,
   thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
   and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit. John
   iii. 8. You may not certainly know when to fix the precise time of your
   conversion, or how to trace the particular steps by which it has been
   brought to pass; for as thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit,
   nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even
   so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. Eccl. xi. 5. But
   though you cannot trace the process of the operation, the effects of it
   are such as you may feel within you, and by its fruits it will be
   known. Matt. vii. 20.

   It is indeed desirable to be able to give an account of the beginning
   and the progress of the work of God upon your souls, as some that are
   regenerate can do; but this is not necessary to evidence the truth of
   grace. Happy is he who in this case can say as the blind man in the
   gospel, One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see. John ix.
   25. For as you know that there is fire when you see the flame, though
   you know not how or when it began; so also it may be discerned, that
   you have really undergone a saving change, though you know not how or
   when it was wrought in your hearts. If you answer the characters I laid
   down in the preceding discourses, as essential to the truly regenerate,
   which are all comprehended in repentance and faith, producing an
   unfeigned love and uniform obedience, you may trace the cause from the
   effect, with far greater certainty than you could have traced such an
   effect, as what would infallibly follow from any cause which you could
   have perceived in your minds previous to it. There may be great
   awakenings, violent terrors, and ecstatic joys, where there is no
   saving work of God on the soul; but where the Divine image is produced,
   and the soul is actually renewed, we are sure, as was before observed,
   that grace has been working, though we know not when, or where, or how.

   And therefore, on the whole, guarding against both these extremes, and
   to cure them both,

   3. Let Christians, in a prudent and humble manner, be ready to
   communicate their religious experiences to each other.

   God undoubtedly intended that the variety of his operations should be
   observed and owned in the world of grace, as well as in that of nature;
   and as these things pass in the secret recesses of men's hearts, how
   should they be known, unless they will themselves communicate and
   declare them? And let me caution you against that strange averseness to
   all freedoms of this kind, which, especially in persons of a reserved
   temper, is so ready to prevail.

   Let not any think it beneath them to do it. You well know that David,
   who was not only a a man of an admirable genius, but a mighty prince,
   too, was far from thinking it so; on the contrary, deeply impressed
   with the Divine condescension in all the gracious visits he had
   received from him, he calls, as it were, the whole pious world around
   him, that they might be edified and comforted by the relation: Come,
   says he, and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he has
   done for my soul. Psal. lxvi. 16. He proclaimed it, not with his voice
   and harp alone, but with his immortal pen; and many other noble and
   excellent persons concurred with him; and the invaluable treasure of
   their experiences, in as great a variety of circumstances as we can
   well imagine, is transmitted to us in the book of Psalms. Can any just
   reason then be assigned, why they, who live under a nobler
   dispensation, and a more abundant communication of the Spirit, should
   be entirely silent on this subject?

   There may indeed be an over-forwardness, which is the apparent effect
   of pride and self-conceit, and which, with thinking people, may bring
   even the sincerity of the speaker into question, or put his
   indiscretion beyond all possibility of being questioned. But it would
   be very unreasonable to argue, that because a thing may be done ill, it
   cannot possibly be done well.

   Why may not intimate friends open their hearts to each other on such
   delightful topics? Why may not they, who have met with anything
   peculiar of this kind, communicate it to their minister? And though I
   must in conscience declare against making it absolutely and universally
   a term of communion, yet I am well assured that in some instances a
   prudent and serious communication of these things to a Christian
   society, when a person is to be admitted into fellowship with it, has
   often answered very valuable ends. By this means God has the honor of
   his own work: and others have the pleasure of sympathizing with the
   relator, both in his sorrows and his joys: they derive from hence some
   additional satisfaction as to his fitness for an approach to the Lord's
   table; they learn with pleasure the Divine blessing which attends the
   administration of ordinances among them: and make observations and
   remarks which may assist them in offering their addresses to God, and
   in giving proper advices to others who are in circumstances like those
   related. To all which we may add, that the ministers of Christ do, in
   particular, learn what may be a means of forming them to a more
   experimental manner of preaching, as well as in many instances discover
   those, before unknown, tokens of success which may strengthen their
   hands in the work of their great Master.

   It is by frequent conversations of this kind, I have learned many of
   the particulars on which I have grounded the preceding discourse. I
   hope therefore you will excuse me, if, on so natural an occasion, I
   have borne my public testimony to what has been so edifying to me, both
   as a minister and a Christian. And the tender regard which I have for
   young persons training up for the work of the ministry, and my ardent
   desire that they may learn the language of Zion, and have those
   peculiar advantages which nothing but an acquaintance with causes, and
   an observation on facts can give, has been a further inducement to me
   to add this reflection, with which I conclude my discourse; humbly
   hoping that what you have heard upon this occasion will, by the Divine
   blessing, furnish out agreeable matter for such conversation as I have
   now recommended, to the glory of God, and to the advancement of
   religion among you. Amen.

DISCOURSE IX.

  DIRECTIONS TO AWAKENED SINNERS.

  Acts ix. 6.

   And he, trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to
   do.

   THESE are the words of Saul, who also is called Paul, (Acts xiii. 9,)
   when he was stricken to the ground as he was going to Damascus; and any
   one who had looked upon him in his present circumstances and knew
   nothing more of him than that view, in comparison with his past life,
   could have given, would have imagined him one of the most miserable
   creatures that ever lived upon earth, and would have expected that he
   should very soon have been numbered among the most miserable of those
   in hell.

   He was engaged in a course of such savage cruelty as can upon no
   principle of common morality be vindicated, even though the Christians
   had been as much mistaken, as he rashly and foolishly concluded they
   were. After having dragged many of them into prison, and given his
   voice against some that were put to death, he persecuted others into
   strange cities; and had now obtained a commission from the Sanhedrim at
   Jerusalem to carry this holy, or rather this impious war into Damascus,
   (Acts xxvi. 10-12,) and to bring all the disciples of the blessed Jesus
   bound from thence to Jerusalem: (Acts ix. 2:) probably that they might
   there be animadverted upon with greater severity than could safely have
   been attempted by the Jews in so distant a city, under a foreign
   governor.

   But behold, as he was in the way, Jesus interposes, clothed with a
   lustre exceeding that of the sun at noon. Acts xxvi. 13. He strikes him
   down from the beast on which he rode, and lays him prostrate on the
   ground, calling to him with a voice far more dreadful than that of
   thunder, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Acts ix. 4.

   Any one would have imagined, from the circumstances in which he now
   beheld Saul, that Divine vengeance had already begun to seize him, and
   that full execution would quickly have been done. But God's ways are
   not as our ways, nor are his thoughts as our thoughts. Isa. lv. 8.
   Christ laid him almost as low as hell, that he might raise him as high
   as the third heaven; of which he afterwards gave him a view in vision,
   to anticipate his reception into it. 2 Cor. xii. 2. This day of his
   terror and astonishment was, in a nobler sense than any other, the day
   of his birth; for he is brought to bow himself at the foot of an
   injured Saviour, to offer him, as it were, a blank upon which to write
   his own terms of peace; and as soon as he heard that this glorious
   person was Jesus, whom, in his members, he had so long persecuted, he
   makes his submission in these lively, comprehensive words, Lord, what
   wilt thou have me to do? This was not a time for a long speech; but be
   that discerns all the secret recesses of the spirit, knew these few
   words were full of a most important meaning, and expressed not only a
   grief of heart for all that he had before been doing against Christ and
   his kingdom, but the sincerest resolution for the future to employ
   himself in his service, waiting only the intimations of his wise and
   gracious will, as to the most proper and acceptable manner of beginning
   the attempt.

   There is, methinks, a poignant kind of eloquence in this short
   expression, far beyond what any paraphrase upon it can give: and our
   compassionate Lord accepted this surrender. All his former rebellions
   were no more remembered against him; and before he rose from the
   ground, to which he fell on so terrible an occasion, Christ gave him an
   intimation, not only that his forfeited life should be spared, so that
   he should get safe into the city to which he was bound, but that he
   should there be instructed in the service which Jesus, whom he had
   persecuted, would now condescend to receive at his hands.

   I represent the case thus largely, because I hope it is a case, which,
   in some measure, suits the experience of some that hear me this
   evening. Paul tells us, it was for this reason, among others, that he
   himself obtained mercy, though he was the chief of sinners, that in
   him, as the chief, Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering,
   for a pattern to them who should afterwards believe. 1 Tim. i. 15, 16.

   Is there then, in this assembly, any awakened and convinced sinner; any
   one that, apprized of his folly, and sensible of his misery, is
   desirous to fall at the foot of Christ, and say with Saul, Lord, what
   wilt thou have me to do? That which I see not, teach thou me; and
   wherein I have done iniquity, I will do so no more! Job xxxiv. 32. Such
   would I now especially address; and while I put the question, Is there
   any such among us? I would fain persuade myself, there are several. For
   I humbly hope, that all the labors that have been bestowed in the
   preceding discourses are not in vain, nor all the prayers that have
   been offered for their success in vain; prayers which, I doubt not,
   have been carried by many of you into your families and your closets,
   as well as jointly presented to God in this public assembly. Trusting,
   therefore, that it is thus with some, and praying that it may be a more
   frequent case, I proceed,

   Sixthly, to give some directions to such as are awakened by Divine
   grace to a sense of their misery in an unregenerate state, and are
   brought to desire recovery from it.

   To such I propose to give directions: and to what purpose would it be
   to undertake to offer them to any others? Who would pretend to teach
   those who are unconcerned about their salvation, what methods they are
   to take in order to their becoming truly regenerate? This, methinks,
   would be like giving directions how those might learn to write who do
   not desire it, and will not take a pen into their hands. All I could
   say to such, while they continue in this character, would vanish into
   empty air. It would not, probably, be so much as observed and
   remembered.

   I speak therefore to awakened souls, and it is pleasant to address such
   on this head. Ananias undoubtedly undertook his message to Saul with
   cheerfulness, to tell him what Christ would have him to do: and I would
   with pleasure and cheerfulness engage in the like work; humbly hoping,
   that some will hear with observation and attention--will hear for
   themselves and so hear for their good. Job v. 27. And to this purpose
   let me advise you--to attend to the impressions that have been made
   upon you with great seriousness--to break off everything that is
   contrary to them--to seek for further knowledge in religious
   matters--to pour out your souls before God in earnest prayer--to
   communicate the state of your case to some experienced Christian--to
   acquaint yourselves with such as are much in your own circumstances--to
   fly immediately to Christ, as ready to receive all that come to him--to
   dedicate yourselves to him, and to his service, in the most solemn
   manner--to arm yourselves to encounter the greatest difficulties in
   your Christian course--and finally, to take every step in this attempt
   with a deep sense of your own weakness, and an humble dependence upon
   Divine grace to be communicated to you as the matter requires. These
   are the several directions I would offer to you: and may they be
   impressed in such a manner on your souls, that none of you may lose the
   things that have been wrought: (2 John ver. 8:) but by the effectual
   working of the mighty power of God, (Eph. i. 19,) such as he graciously
   has been pleased to bring to the birth, may be brought forth, (Isa.
   lxvi. 9,) and such as are awakened may be savingly renewed!

   1. I would advise you to attend to the impressions made upon you with
   great seriousness.

   They may perhaps take you a little off the world and its concernments;
   and some will blame you for suffering such an interruption: but regard
   not that censure. The time will come, if you pursue these things
   aright, when renewed diligence, prudence, and the Divine blessing, will
   amply make amends for any present hindrance which these impressions may
   occasion. And if it should be otherwise, is there not a cause? If a man
   seized with a threatening distemper should choose, for a little while,
   to lay aside his usual business, that he might attend to the care of
   his health, before the symptoms grew incurable would any body blame him
   for this? On the contrary, would it not be looked upon as acting a very
   wise, prudent, and necessary part? Much more may be said here. It is
   not a light thing for you, because it is your life. Deut. xxxii. 47.
   And if the life is more than meat, and the body than raiment, (Matt.
   vi. 25,) then surely the soul is more to be regarded than either. And
   therefore what you do in your worldly affairs, do moderately, and do
   not grudge that retirement which is so necessary in such a tender
   circumstance as this.

   I may apply to you, on this occasion, those words of Solomon: Through
   desire a man having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with
   all wisdom. Prov. xviii. 1. If you desire to attain Divine wisdom, you
   must separate yourself from all other things to pursue it. And it is
   the more necessary to attend to this now, because the Tempter may
   probably contrive to lay some more than ordinary avocation in your way,
   at a time when the interest of his kingdom requires you should be
   diverted from prosecuting those views which are presenting themselves
   to you, and by which you may so probably be rescued out of his hands,
   and put forever out of his power.

   2. Let me advise you to break off everything which is contrary to such
   impressions as these.

   Sin will immediately appear to have been your disease and your ruin:
   and therefore, if ever you hope for recovery, you must resolutely break
   with that; not merely with this or that particular evil, but with every
   sin; and that not only for a little while, but entirely and forever. A
   mortal, irreconcilable war must be declared against it. Every fleshly
   lust must be denied, every immoral practice, for which your heart may
   at any time smite you, must be reformed; and if ever you expect to reap
   mercy and life, you must, as the prophet expresses it, break up your
   fallow ground, (Hos. x. 12,) and not sow among thorns. Jer. iv. 3. For
   righteousness has no fellowship with unrighteousness, and light no
   communion with darkness. 2 Cor. vi. 14. And you may be assured, that as
   all sin grieves the Spirit of God, and strengthens the heavy fetters
   which lie upon the soul; so those sins which are committed after these
   awakenings and convictions, have a peculiar guilt attending them, and
   do greater despite to the Spirit of grace, (Heb. x. 29,) in proportion
   to the degree in which his motions on the soul have been vigorous and
   warm.

   3. Seek further knowledge, especially from the word and ordinances of
   God.

   The influences of Divine grace are not to be considered as a blind
   impulse: but God's Spirit works on the spirit of man, as one rational
   being on another. The apostle therefore put the question with great
   reason, How shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?
   Rom. x. 14. And as some knowledge is the foundation on which the Spirit
   of God ordinarily operates in men's hearts; so in proportion to the
   degree in which you attain further light into the scheme of the gospel,
   and of salvation by Christ, it may be expected you will be more
   impressed by it. The mention of this is so much the more necessary, as
   mistaken notions of religion often expose people on the one hand, to
   great perplexities, and on the other, betray them into a false peace,
   which one way or another will be bitterness in the end.

   Come, therefore, to the house of God, and attend spiritual preaching.
   The question is not about forms, but things. Be not therefore
   over-scrupulous about what is merely circumstantial in religion, on the
   one hand or the other: but where you find more spiritual light and
   improvement, there choose generally to attend: not confining religion
   to any particular party, nor judging those who differ from you in their
   sentiment or practice; but calmly and humbly seeking your own
   edification, leaving others to seek theirs where they are persuaded, in
   the sight of God, they may most probably find it.

   Above all, remember, in this circumstance, to make the word of God the
   man of your counsel, (Psal. cxix. 24,) and to judge of what you read
   and hear by the tenor of that, as the oracle of eternal truth; always
   attending the reading of it with earnest prayer to God for the
   illumination of his Spirit, as I shall afterwards more particularly
   direct. No other books are to be set up in opposition to this, or in
   comparison with it; yet let it be your care, in subordination to
   scripture, to study the writings of those faithful servants of God in
   latter ages, who themselves manifest a sense of practical religion.
   Especially endeavor to find out and peruse those writings which treat
   of conversion and regeneration, and which contain advice suited to your
   case. Blessed be God, our language abounds with such: and every truly
   Christian minister will be glad to direct you to them, and so far as he
   has a convenient opportunity to furnish you with them.

   4. Pour out your soul before God in earniest prayer.

   You cannot be unacquainted with the many promises God has made in
   scripture for the encouragement of those who desire to pray to him in
   the sincerity of their hearts. You know into how little a compass
   Christ has crowded together three equivalent promises. Ask, and it
   shall be given you: seek and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be
   opened unto you; (Matt. vii. 7;) and you cannot but remember the
   threefold encouragement, from the success of those who have recourse to
   this expedient, which he has added in the most express and general
   terms: For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
   findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. Verse 8. Go,
   therefore, in a cheerful dependence upon this promise: go, and try the
   truth of it. Whither should a creature in such circumstances go, but to
   that God, who has the hearts of all in his hand as the rivers of water,
   and turns them whithersoever he will? Prov. xxi. 1. And who should go
   to him, rather than you? And in what circumstances should a distressed
   creature rather think of looking and crying to him, than in these;
   where it sees itself surrounded with so much danger, and yet feels an
   inward earnest desire, not only of deliverance, but of holiness, too?
   Go, therefore, and cast yourself at the feet of God this very evening:
   do it as soon as you return to your habitations; and if you can not put
   your thoughts and desires into words, at least sigh and groan before
   the Lord. Mourn, if you can not pray; and mourn that you can not; or
   rather be assured, that unutterable groanings have sometimes the
   greatest efficacy, and prove the most prevailing eloquence.

   It will be no wonder at all, if in these circumstances Satan should
   endeavor to terrify you. It is his common practice. So many souls have
   vanquished him upon their knees, that he dreads and hates the posture:
   but draw an argument from that very opposition to make you so much the
   more eager and importunate; and when your heart is overwhelmed within
   you, fly unto the rock that is higher than you. Psal. lxi. 2.

   I will add, Be not discouraged, though help be not immediately
   imparted. Though you may seem to be cast out of God's sight, yet look
   again towards his holy temple: (Jonah ii. 4:) though you may seem to
   cry from the deep, and almost from the belly of hell, (Ver. 2,) the
   bowels of a heavenly Father will yearn over you as returning prodigals;
   and I doubt not you will meet with the reception that Ephraim found,
   when God saw him bemoaning and humbling himself, because he had been as
   a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: when he cried, Turn thou me, and I
   shall be turned: for thou art the Lord my God; his heavenly Father
   answers him in these most affectionate words: attend to them, O thou
   returning sinner, for thy comfort in this hour of distress! Is Ephraim
   my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I
   do earnestly remember him still; therefore my bowels are troubled for
   him, and I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord. Jer. xxxi.
   18, 20.

   5. I would advise you farther, that you immediately communicate the
   state of your case to some experienced Christian.

   I know there is a backwardness in persons of your circumstances to do
   it; and it has been surprising to me to learn from some, who, in this
   respect, have afterwards grown wiser, how long they have been pining
   away. in their sorrows before they could be persuaded to consult their
   ministers or Christian friends. It is a stratagem of Satan, against
   which I would by all means caution you. And one would think your own
   reason should suggest some very obvious advantages attending the method
   I propose, of opening your case freely to those whom you think to be
   more experienced in these things. The impression may be revived upon
   your own souls, even by the account you give them: and their advice may
   be exceeding useful to you to guard you against the wiles of the enemy
   which they have known, though hitherto you have been strangers to them;
   and to guide you into such methods as, by the Divine blessing, may
   farther promote that good work which seems, in any measure, to have
   been begun within you. You may also depend upon it that it will engage
   their prayers for you; which, in this case, may have great prevalency.
   And it will also naturally lead them to inspect your conduct: and if
   they see you afterwards in danger of being drawn aside, they may remind
   you of the hopes once entertained, and the impressions once made upon
   your mind. In this respect you may hope, that by walking with wise men
   you will be yet wiser; (Prov. xiii. 20;) and will soon find how happy
   an exchange you make, when you give up your vain, and perhaps wicked
   companions, that you may become the companion of them that fear God,
   and that keep his precepts; (Psal. cxix. 63;) and may have your delight
   in them, who, in the judgment of God, are the excellent of the earth,
   (Psal. xvi. 3,) however they may be despised and derided by men.

   6. I would also advise that you endeavor to search out those, if there
   be any such about or near you, who are much in your own circumstances.

   Observe, especially among young people, whether there are any that seem
   of late to have grown more serious than ordinary; and particularly more
   constant in attending the ordinances of God, and more cautious in
   venturing on occasions and temptations to sin; and if you can discover
   such, endeavor to form an acquaintance with them. Try by proper hints
   how far their circumstances resemble yours; and as you find
   encouragement, enter into a stricter friendship with them, founded on
   religion, and intended to promote it in each other's hearts. Associate
   yourselves in little bands for Christian converse and prayer; and by
   this means you will quicken and strengthen the hearts of each other.
   For on the one hand, what they tell you of their own experience will
   much confirm you in a persuasion that what you find in yourselves is
   not a mere fancy, but is really a Divine work begun on your hearts, and
   will give you encouragement to pursue it as such; for as face answers
   to face, in water, so does the heart of man to man. Prov. xxvii. 19.
   And on the other hand, the observation of your pious zeal will quicken
   others, and may occasion the revival of religion in the hearts of older
   Christians; as I bless God, I have found some things of this kind have
   done, and hope, and through the Divine blessing expect, to find it more
   and more. Therefore exhort one another daily, while it is called
   to-day, lest any of you should be hardened through the deceitfulness of
   sin. Heb. iii. 13. Strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble
   knees; (Isa. xxxv. 3;) and be assured, that while you are endeavoring
   to help others, you will find in yourselves the first fruits of this
   happy attempt; and while you water others, you will be watered also
   yourselves.

   7. It is an advice of the highest importance, that whoever you are, you
   should immediately fly to Christ, and repose the confidence of your
   souls upon him.

   Observe that I urge you, WHOEVER YOU ARE, to fly immediately to Christ:
   and this I do, to guard against a strange notion which some are ready
   to entertain, as if we were to bring something of our own righteousness
   and obedience to him, to render us worthy of being accepted by him. But
   this is a grand mistake. The blessings of the gospel are not to be
   considered as matter of bargain and sale: no, if we come to buy wine
   and milk, it must be without money and without price; (Isa. lv. 1;) and
   whoever will take of the water of life, must do it freely. Rev. xxii.
   17. If he pretend to offer an equivalent, he forfeits his share in the
   invitation; and must be made to know, that the price he offers is a
   great affront to the value of the blessings for which he would thus
   barter.

   Let this then be your language, "Lord, I have undone myself, and in me
   is no help; I see nothing in myself which makes me worthy of thy
   regard; but this I know, that where sin has abounded, grace does much
   more abound, and reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by
   Jesus Christ; (Rom. v. 20, 21;) through whom thou hast assured me in
   thy word that eternal life is the gift of God. Rom. vi. 23. As such let
   me receive it: and by how much the more undeserving I have been, by so
   much the more will I celebrate the riches of thy grace in making me a
   vessel of mercy, and a monument of love throughout all eternity.
   Blessed Jesus, thou hast said, that him who comes unto thee thou wilt
   in no wise cast out; (John vi. 37;) behold, I come, and cast myself at
   thy feet; receive me, and put me among the children, (Jer. iii. 19,)
   though I deserve not the very crumbs that fall from thy table." Matt.
   xv. 27.

   You will not, I hope, imagine that when I give such advice as this, I
   mean to insinuate that a person, purposing to continue in his sins, may
   nevertheless come and receive the blessings of the gospel: for that
   would be no other than in the grossest manner to pervert and contradict
   the whole tenor of it. But this I say, and repeat it, that when once a
   sinner finds himself, by Divine grace, disposed to turn from his sins
   to God, and made willing to accept the mercy tendered in the gospel, of
   which a deliverance from sin and a renovation of nature are a great,
   important, and essential part; he may with cheerfulness apply himself
   to the great Redeemer, as one of those whom he came on purpose to
   deliver; and in proportion to the degree in which he can discern the
   sincerity of his sentiments, he may open his heart to comfort, how
   great soever his former unworthiness has been, and how lately soever
   such impressions may have been made upon his heart.

   8. Make the dedication of yourselves to Christ and his service as
   solemn a thing as you can.

   We read in the Acts of some that were baptized, and publicly received
   into the church the very same day in which they were converted. Acts
   ii. 41, 47. Though a change of circumstances may at present render it
   convenient to defer doing it for some time, because it is proper that
   the efficacy of your repentance and conversion should first of all be
   so far seen, as in the judgment of charity to approve the sincerity of
   it: yet I think, when you feel your hearts absolutely determined for
   God, you should in a solemn manner lay hold of his covenant, in secret
   at least, as soon as possible; and declare, as before him that
   searcheth all hearts, the sincerity of that acceptance. Some have
   recommended the doing this in a written engagement: and there are
   several very affecting forms of this kind in books on this subject,
   which may very profitably be used. But I hope the fullness of your
   heart will dictate something of this kind, if such helps should be
   wanting, or if any peculiar consideration should prevent their being
   used.

   And surely, if you feel the love of the blessed Jesus glowing in your
   hearts as you ought, you will need no other engagement to yield
   yourselves to him: that love will be instead of ten thousand arguments;
   and you will see a secret charm in the view of serving him, which will
   engage your very soul to spring forward with vigor and eagerness to
   every proper instance of it. The dread of future punishment has
   certainly its use to restrain from the commission of sin, especially in
   an hour of pressing temptation; and the hope of that exceeding and
   eternal weight of glory, which the gospel promises, will have a still
   greater efficacy upon a generous mind: yet I will venture to say, that
   a heart powerfully impressed with the love of Jesus will have a
   stronger influence than either of these. Cordial friendship needs not
   to be hired to perform its proper office. Love is a law to itself: it
   adds a delightful relish to every attempt for the service of its
   object: and it is most evidently thus in the present case.

   "Lord," will the Christian say, "wilt thou do me the honor to accept
   any feeble attempt for thy service which I can form? I thank thee for
   it, and bow my head before thee in the most grateful acknowledgments,
   that thou favorest me with an ability to discharge, in any degree, the
   fullness of my grateful heart in presenting them. O that my whole soul
   might daily rise before thee as an acceptable sacrifice in the flame of
   love! O that I might always feel my heart enlarged, to run the way of
   thy commandments! Psal. cxix. 32. Were the degree of my future
   happiness from this moment invariably fixed, I would still pursue this
   delightful business; for there is no other in which my soul could find
   a pleasure equal, or comparable to it." If you feel such thoughts as
   these rising in your mind, breathe them out before the throne from day
   to day; and when you have done it, recollect frequently the vows of God
   that are upon you; (Psal. lvi. 12;) and see, that having sworn, you
   perform it, (Ps. cxix. 106,) and maintain in the whole of your lives a
   conduct agreeable to such a profession as this.

   9. Gird up the loins of your mind to encounter a great deal of
   difficulty in your Christian course.

   Many are the difficulties that you must expect; great, and possibly for
   a while increasing difficulties. It is commonly said, indeed, that
   those difficulties which attend the entrance on a religious life are
   the greatest; and in themselves considered, no doubt but they are so:
   they arise from many quarters, and unite all together in the same
   design of keeping you from a believing application to Christ, and a
   resolute closure with him. In this respect, evil sometimes arises to a
   man in his own house; (Matt. x. 35, 36;) and those, whose near relation
   should rather engage them to give the young convert the best assistance
   where his most important interests are concerned, are on the contrary
   ready to lay a stumbling block in his way; and perhaps act as if they
   had rather he should have no religion at all, than change a few
   circumstances in the outward profession of it. Worldly interest, too,
   is perhaps to be sacrificed; and conscience cannot be preserved without
   giving up the friendship of those whom at any other expense but
   conscience a man would gladly oblige. And it is no wonder if Satan make
   his utmost efforts, and those very unwearied, too, that he may prevent
   the revolt of these subjects, or rather the escape of his prisoners.
   The Christian is therefore called upon by the apostle to arm himself as
   for a combat, and that at all points; to put on the whole armor of God,
   that he may be able to withstand in the evil day; and having done all,
   to stand. Ephes. vi. 11, 13.

   Nor must you, my friends, though as soon as you have put on your
   harness you gain some important victory, boast as if you might securely
   put it off. 1 Kings xx. 11. Your whole life must be a series of
   exercise. Through much opposition, as well as much tribulation, you
   must enter into the kingdom of God: (Luke ix. 62:) and though your
   difficulties may generally be greatest at first, yet your
   encouragements then may perhaps be so peculiarly great, and your
   spirits under their first religious impressions so warm, that other
   difficulties, in themselves smaller, may afterwards press more sensibly
   upon you. Endeavor therefore to keep yourselves in a prepared posture.
   Put on a steady resolution; and to support it, sit down and count the
   cost, lest having begun to build, you shamefully desist and be not able
   to finish it; (Luke xiv. 28, 30;) or lest having put your hand to the
   plow, you should look back, and become unfit for the kingdom of God.
   Luke ix. 62. And therefore,

   10. Let every step in this attempt be taken with a deep sense of your
   own weakness, and on humble dependence upon Divine grace to be
   communicated to you as the matter requires.

   Recollect seriously what I was telling you in a former discourse, of
   the necessity of a Divine agency and interposition; and remember, it
   depends upon God, not only to begin the good work, but also to carry it
   on, and perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. Phil. i. 6. If we
   trust in our hearts, especially after this solemn admonition, this
   plain instruction, added to such frequent experience, we are fools
   indeed. Prov. xxviii. 26. Let us therefore trust in the Lord, and not
   lean to our own understanding. Prov. iii. 5. And do you, my friends,
   who have but just enlisted yourselves in this holy war, every one of
   you say, with an humble yet cheerful heart, in the name of our God will
   we set up our banners. Psal. xx. 5. And if thus you wait on the Lord,
   you shall renew your strength; and even the feeblest soul shall be
   enabled by Divine grace to mount up with wings as eagles, and to press
   on from one degree of religious improvement to another, while the
   youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.
   Isa. xl. 30, 31. The Apostle expresses, in the liveliest manner, his
   dependence on the Divine Redeemer to communicate this grace in a proper
   degree, when he says, Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that
   we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need: (Heb. iv.
   16:) plainly implying, that it may be obtained if we have but hearts to
   seek for it; which, as on the one hand, it effectually takes off all
   idle excuses for the neglect of our duty, pleaded from our own
   acknowledged weakness, any further than we are supported by Divine
   power; so on the other hand it animates the heart, that, sensible of
   its various infirmities, desires nevertheless to go forth to the work
   of God, and to consecrate all its faculties to his service; using them,
   such as they are, for God, and humbly seeking from him the enlargement
   of them.

   Go, therefore, my friends, into the Divine presence; and while under a
   sense of this be not discouraged, though mountains of opposition may
   lie in your way. Those mountains shall be made low, and spread
   themselves into a plain before you; (Isa. xi. 4;) while you go forth
   under the influences of the Spirit of the Lord who is able to make all
   grace abound to his people. 2 Cor. ix. 8. Of this Paul in our text was
   a most celebrated instance, who not only received, as was here
   promised, directions what he should do, but had strength also given him
   to perform it; a strength, which was made perfect and illustrious in
   his weakness: (2 Cor. xii. 9:) and when, in consequence of this, he had
   attained to very distinguished improvements in religion, and had been
   enabled to act up, in the most honorable manner, not only to the
   Christian character in general, but to that of a minister and an
   apostle, he acknowledges, in all his abundant labors, that it was not
   he, but the grace of God that was with him. 1 Cor. xv. 10.

   If he be thus with you, my dear friends, you will be established and
   built up in your most holy faith. Col. ii 7; Jude ver. 20. The most
   agreeable hopes we form concerning you, when we see you under such
   serious impressions as this discourse supposes, will be answered; and
   they who have spoken to you the word of God, on such occasions as
   these, will have the pleasure to think that they have not run in vain.
   Phil. ii. 16.

   And now if these directions, which I have offered to you with great
   plainness and freedom, but with the sincerest desire of your
   edification and establishment in religion, be seriously pursued, I
   shall have the satisfaction of thinking, that though I might find you
   in the number of the unregenerate when I began these lectures, I shall
   carry you on along with me in a new character through the only head
   that yet remains to be handled. I shall indeed address myself to you,
   as those who were sometimes darkness, but are now light in the Lord,
   (Eph. v. 8,) when I proceed to address those who have been renewed by
   Divine grace; which I promised as my last general topic, and with which
   I shall conclude my discourses on this important subject.

DISCOURSE X.

  AN ADDRESS TO THE REGENERATE, FOUNDED ON THE PRECEDING DISCOURSES.

  James I. 18.

   Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a
   kind of first fruits of his creatures.

   I INTEND the words which I have now been reading, only as an
   introduction to that address to the sons and daughters of the Lord
   Almighty, with which I am now to conclude these lectures; and therefore
   shall not enter into any critical discussion, either of them, or of the
   context.

   I hope God has made the series of these discourses, in some measure,
   useful to those for whose service they were immediately intended: but
   if they have not been so to all, and if with relation to many I have
   labored in vain from Sabbath to Sabbath, I cannot be surprised at it.
   What am I better than my fathers? 1 Kings xix. 4. It has, in every age,
   been their complaint, that they have stretched out their hands all the
   day to a disobedient and gainsaying people; (Isa. 1xv. 2: Rom. x. 21;)
   that the bellows have been burnt, and the lead consumed of the fire,
   but the dross has not been taken away: such reprobate silver have
   multitudes been found. Jer. vi. 29, 30. Yea, the Lord Jesus Christ
   himself, who spake with such unequaled eloquence, with such divine
   energy, yet met with multitudes, who were like the deaf adder, that
   would not hearken to the voice of the wisest charmer: (Ps. lviii. 4,
   5:) and surely the disciple is not above his master, nor the servant
   above his lord. Matt. x. 24.

   When indeed we consider the infinite importance of the message we
   address to you, O ye perishing sinners I we hardly know how to give
   over, or to take a denial. We feel a strong impulse on our hearts to
   give line upon line, and precept upon precept: (Isa. xxviii. 10:) as a
   physician that loves his patient, when he sees the distemper
   prevailing, and has run through the whole range of medicines, is ready,
   while life yet remains, not entirely to give over, but to repeat again
   what he had prescribed unsuccessfully before. And if God spares our
   lives, no doubt many of those things which I have before been urging,
   must in substance be repeated. But at present I will desist: I know not
   what more or further to say; and if you are utterly unimpressed with
   what I have already laid before you, especially with regard to the
   character of the unregenerate--the nature of regeneration--the absolute
   necessity of it--and of the Divine agency in producing it, with the
   absolute importance of your securing a part in the kingdom of heaven; I
   know not what further to urge, and must leave you either to the grace
   or the judgment of God.

   The time will certainly come, when you will see and own the importance
   of these things. The word of God will, in one sense or another, take
   hold of every soul that hears it, and, perhaps on some of you in a very
   terrible manner, and in a very little time. But if it do, I may say
   with the apostle Paul, when in token of the solemnity with which he
   spoke, he shook his raiment, and took leave of his obstinate hearers, I
   am clean from your blood; (Acts xviii. 6;) and since you refuse to be
   instructed, I turn to those who regard what I say. And thus, according
   to the method I at first proposed, I proceed,

   Seventhly, To conclude these discourses with an address to those who,
   by Divine grace, are experimentally acquainted with this great work of
   regeneration; to show them how they ought to be affected with the
   consideration of the truths that have been offered, and what
   improvement they should make of such a course of sermons as you have
   lately been attending.

   Out of a general regard to the glory of God and the good of souls, you
   have attended on what has hitherto been spoken to persons of a very
   different character; and I hope not altogether without some sensible
   refreshment and advantage; but now hear more immediately for
   yourselves, and suffer a word of exhortation in such particulars as
   these: Be thankful to God for what you have experienced; improve it as
   an engagement to behave in a suitable manner; study to promote the work
   of God upon the hearts of others; and long for that blessed world where
   the change that is now begun, and is gradually advancing in your souls,
   shall be universal and complete. Your own wisdom and piety have, no
   doubt, anticipated me in each of these particulars; but you will be
   glad to enter more fully into the reflection than you could do, while
   it was intermingling itself with other thoughts.

   I. Return the most affectionate acknowledgments of praise to the God of
   all mercy for the experience you have had of a regenerating change.

   I would now address this exhortation and charge to every one of you,
   who, through Divine grace, hope you can say, that you are born again;
   to all who can say, that God has, of his own will, begotten you with
   the word of truth, that you may be a kind of first fruits of his
   creatures. To you I would say, Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his,
   and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness and goodness. Psal.
   xxx. 4. Give thanks to the Father, who has made you meet to be
   partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. Col. i. 12. Join
   your voices and your hearts in the most cheerful hymns of praise,
   whatever your different circumstances are. Let the young and the old,
   the rich and the poor, the honorable and the mean, rejoice together; if
   any may be called poor, who are thus enriched; if any may be accounted
   mean, who are thus honored. Bless the Lord at all times, let his praise
   be continually in your mouths; (Ps. xxxiv. 1;) and endeavor to carry
   along with you, through the darkest road you travel, and the bitterest
   sorrows you taste, cheerfulness in your hearts, and praise on your
   tongues; considering--how important the blessing is with which the Lord
   has favored you; how few there are who partake of it; and in the midst
   of how much opposition the Divine grace has taken hold of your souls,
   and wrought its wonders of love there.

   1. Consider, my Christian friends, how important this favor is which
   God has bestowed upon you, in thus begetting you as a kind of first
   fruits of his creatures.

   Justly indeed may we say, Behold what manner of love the Father hath
   bestowed upon us, that we should be regenerated by his grace, and so be
   called, and that with propriety, the sons of God! 1 John iii. 1. Justly
   may I say to you, now you are assembled in the courts of the Lord, in
   those emphatical words of David, O come, let us worship, and bow down;
   let us kneel before the Lord our Maker; (Psal. xcv. 6;) for it is he
   that has made us and not we ourselves, with regard to this second, as
   well as the first creation; and we, in consequence of it, are in the
   noblest sense, his people, and the sheep of his pasture: enter,
   therefore, into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
   praise; be thankful unto him, and bless his name. Ps. c. 3, 4.

   My brethren, it is a favor in which the salvation of your souls is
   concerned; and can that be small? or ought it ever to be thought of but
   with the highest emotion and enlargedness of heart? The gracious
   purposes of God towards his children are to make every one of them
   higher than the kings of the earth, (Psal. lxxxix. 27,) to jive them
   more solid satisfaction than crowns and kingdoms can afford, and at
   length to raise them to a diadem of immortal glory. Oh what reason have
   you with the Apostle, to say, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who, according to his abundant mercy, has begotten us
   again to a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
   dead, even to the hope of an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled,
   and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for us, who are kept by
   the power of God through faith unto salvation! 1 Pet. i. 3-5. Survey
   this great privilege which God has already given you, this high
   security, these glorious hopes. Has he not brought the beginning of
   glory already into your souls? Has he not wrought you to a filial
   temper, and taught you to cry, Abba, Father? Gal. iv. 6. Has he not, in
   some measure, formed and fashioned your minds to a meetness to dwell
   with angels and perfected spirits in heaven? So that you can now say,
   even with relation to that which you already feel, that you are no more
   strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of
   the household of God. Eph. ii. 19. You are even now the sons of God,
   and it doth not yet appear what you shall be; (1 John iii. 2;) but
   there is enough appears, and enough known at present, of what you are,
   and what you shall be, to revive, to delight, to transport the heart.

   And is not this too, O thou afflicted soul, who art called to encounter
   the most painful difficulties, enough to be the means of thy support,
   and to afford thee matter for thy strong consolation? You that are
   tossed with tempests, (Isa. liv. 11,) and obliged to struggle under
   various and long continued burdens, have you not here a joy that the
   world can neither bestow nor impair, a pleasure in public and in secret
   duties, and a hope, which is as the anchor of the soul both sure and
   steadfast, entering into that within the vail, (Heb. vi. 19,) and so
   enabling you to outride these storms and tempests? How glorious does
   your lot appear when viewed in the light of scripture! You are
   expressly told, All things are yours: (1 Cor. iii. 21:) the Lord will
   give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from you:
   (Psal. lxxxiv. 11:) all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth to
   you; (Psal. xxv. 10;) and ere long you shall see how they are so. You
   have a sight by faith of the inheritance appointed for his children;
   but he does not intend merely a distant prospect for you: you shall go
   in and possess that good land, (Deut. iv. 22,) and shall ere long be
   absent from the body, and present with the Lord: (2 Cor. v. 8:) yea,
   the Lord Jesus Christ, ere long, shall come to be glorified in his
   saints, and to be admired in all them that believe, (2 Thess. i. 10,)
   to be glorified and admired, in and by you in particular; when bearing
   the image of your heavenly Father, you shall rise far beyond this earth
   and all its vain anxieties, and vainer amusements, to dwell forever in
   his presence. And what is there in this world that you imagine you
   want, which is by any means to be compared with these enjoyments and
   hopes? Surely, sirs, in such a view, you should be much more than
   content; and should feel your inward admiration, love, and joy,
   bursting the bonds of silence, and turning your voices, that have been
   broken by sighs, into the most cheerful and exalted anthems of praise:
   especially when you consider,

   2. How few there are who partake of this important favor, which God has
   extended to you.

   I hope I need not, after all I have said, remind you at large, that I
   intend not by any means to speak, as excluding those of different forms
   and different experiences; as if, in consequence of that diversity,
   they had neither part nor lot in this matter. Acts viii. 21. I hope.
   that many who are not so ready, as it were to be wished, to receive one
   another, are nevertheless, in this respect, received by Christ to the
   glory of God. Rom. xv. 7. Yet the temper and conduct of the generality
   of mankind, even under a Christian profession, too plainly show, that
   they have the marks of eternal ruin upon them: and one can form no hope
   concerning them, consistent with the tenor of the whole word of God,
   any other than this, that possibly they may hereafter be changed into
   something contrary to what they are, and in that change be happy.

   Now that you are not left among the wide extended ruins of mankind, but
   are set as pillars in the building of God, is what you have been taught
   by the preceding discourses to refer to the grace of God, which has
   taken and polished you to the form you now bear. Or, as the Evangelist
   expresses it, in language more suitable to the subject before us, the
   power, or privilege, to become the sons of God, is what he gives to as
   many as receive him; and it is manifest as to your regeneration, that
   you are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
   will of man, but of God: (John i. 12, 13:) for we love him, because he
   first loved us; (1 John iv. 12;) and whatsoever our attainments be,
   there is no true believer but will be ready, with the Apostle Paul, to
   say, By the grace of God I am what I am. 1 Cor. xv. 10.

   And now, when these two thoughts are taken in this comparison with each
   other, how deeply should they impress our minds! And how should it
   excite us to the most lively gratitude, to consider that when so many
   of our fellow-creatures perish, even under the sound of the gospel;
   that when they live and die under the power of a corrupt and degenerate
   nature, despising all the means which God has given them of becoming
   better, and turning them into the occasion of greater mischief; God
   should graciously incline our hearts to a wiser and better choice! It
   is indeed a melancholy reflection, that the number of those who are
   made wise to salvation should be so small; yet it is an endearing
   circumstance in the Divine goodness to us, that when it is so small, we
   should be included in it: as no doubt it would appear to every truly
   religious person in the ark, that when but eight souls were saved from
   the deluge, he should be one. There is now a remnant, says the Apostle,
   according to the election of grace: (Rom. xi. 5:) to that grace
   therefore should we render the praise. We have indeed chosen him; but
   it is in consequence of his choosing us. John xv. 16. We have said, The
   Lord is my portion; but let us remember to bless him that he has given
   us that counsel, (Psal. xvi. 5, 7,) in consequence of which we have
   been inclined to do it. Again,

   3. Consider, in the midst of how much opposition the grace of God has
   laid hold on your souls, and wrought its wonders of love there.

   Christians, look into your own hearts; yea, look back upon your own
   lives, and see whether many of you have not reason to say, with the
   great Apostle, It is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
   chief: (1 Tim. i. 15:) and yet to me, who am less than the least of all
   saints, is this given, (Eph. iii. 8,) that I should be a regenerate,
   adopted child of God, begotten to an inheritance of eternal glory.

   "Oh," may one Christian say, "how obstinately did I strive against my
   own happiness! like a poor creature that, having received some
   dangerous wound, and being delirious with a fever attending it,
   struggles with the hand that is stretched out to heal him. How did I
   draw back from the yoke of God! How did I trifle with convictions, and
   put them off from one time to another! So that God might most
   righteously have awakened any heart rather than mine. He admonished me
   by his word, and by his providence; he sent afflictions; he wrought out
   deliverances for me; and yet I went on to harden my heart, as if I had
   been afflicted and delivered, that I might work greater abominations;
   (Jer. vii. 10;) till the Lord being merciful to me, laid hold upon me,
   and drew me out of Sodom." Gen. xx. 16.

   And here another Christian will be ready to say within himself, ''If
   the grace of God wrought sooner upon me, when my soul was more pliant,
   when my heart was comparatively tender in infancy or childhood, or in
   early youth; yet what ungrateful returns have I since made for his
   mercy I How defective have I been in those fruits of holiness which
   might reasonably have been expected from me, who have so long a time
   been planted in the house of the Lord! Alas for me! that I have
   flourished no more in the courts of my God. Psal. xcii. 13. How often
   have I forgotten and forsaken him; how cold and negligent has my spirit
   been, how inconstant my walk, how indolent my behavior, for these many
   years that have passed since I was first brought into his family! How
   little have I done in his service in proportion to the advantages I
   have enjoyed! All this he foresaw; all the instances in which my
   goodness would be as a morning cloud, and as the early dew; (Hos. vi.
   4;) all the instances in which this perverse heart of mine, so prone to
   backslide, should turn aside, and start back from him like a deceitful
   bow: (Psal. lxxviii. 57:) and yet he has mercy upon me, I know not why.
   I cannot pretend to account for it any otherwise than by saying, Even
   so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight: (Matt. xi. 26:) thou
   hast mercy on whom thou wilt have mercy, and thou hast compassion on
   whom thou wilt have compassion. Rom. ix. 15. I have revolted deeply
   from thee again and again; yet thou sufferest me not to be lost to this
   very day, nor wilt thou ever suffer it: Thou restorest my soul; thou
   leadest me in the paths of righteousness for thy name's sake. Psal.
   xxiii. 3. Having therefore obtained help from God, I continue to this
   day; (Acts xxvi. 2;) and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all
   the days of my life; and unworthy as I am so much as to enter into
   thine house below, I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever
   above. Psal. xxiii. 6. Thus, Lord, thou makest me, as it were, a wonder
   to myself; and I hope to express my admiration and my gratitude
   throughout eternal ages: and if I can vie with the rest of thy redeemed
   ones in nothing else, I will at least do it in bowing low before thy
   throne, and acknowledging that I am of the number of the most unworthy,
   in whom my Lord has been pleased to glorify the riches of his mercy,
   and the freedom of his grace."

   In the mean time, Christians, I call you often to entertain yourselves
   with such views as these, often to excite your hearts by such lively
   considerations; I call you, in the name of your Father and your
   Saviour, to a whole life of gratitude and praise. And this leads me to
   add,

   II. Improve those experiences you have had of Divine grace, as an
   engagement to behave in a suitable manner.

   Remember the lively admonition of the text, that you were begotten by
   him for this very purpose, that you should be a kind of frst-fruits of
   his creatures. See, therefore, that ye be entirely consecrated to him;
   and behave as becomes the children of God, in the midst of a crooked
   and perverse generation: being not only harmless and blameless among
   them, but shining as lights in the world, and holding forth that word
   of life, (Phil. ii. 16,) by which he has begotten you to himself, and
   quickened you when you were dead in trespasses and sins. Eph. ii. 1, 5.

   God has now brought you into a most honorable relation: he may
   therefore well expect more, much more from you than from others. He has
   made you as his children, kings and priests to himself, (Rev. i. 6,)
   and you are therefore to offer up spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to
   God by Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. ii. 5. You were once darkness, but now are
   ye light in the Lord; walk, therefore, as children of light. Eph. v. 8.
   Remember you are not your own; (1 Cor. vi. 19;) your time, your
   possessions, and all your capacities for service, are the property of
   your heavenly Father. And permit me to remind you, that if you desire
   to see this doctrine of regeneration prevail, you, who profess to be
   experimentally acquainted with it, must take great care that your
   behavior may not only be innocent, but exemplary: otherwise many will
   be ready to blaspheme the holy name of that God, (2 Sam. xii. 14,) whom
   you call your Father; and you are like to bring a reproach upon the
   household of faith, which probably you will never be able to roll away.

   Christians, the dignity of our birth and our hopes is too little
   considered and regarded; and the reason why the world thinks so meanly
   of it, is because we ourselves are so insensible of its excellency. Did
   we apprehend it more, we should surely be more solicitous to walk
   worthy of that calling wherewith we are called, (Eph. iv. 1,) that high
   and holy calling. Let me, therefore, exhort you to endeavor to loosen
   your affections more from these entanglements of time and sense, which
   so much debase our minds, and dishonor our lives. Yield yourselves unto
   God as those that are alive from the dead: (Rom. vi. 13:) employ, with
   a growing zeal, to the honor of God, that renewed life which he has
   given you: Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the
   renewing of your minds: (Rom. xii. 2:) and let your conversation and
   behavior be like those who feel the constraining influences of Divine
   love, (2 Cor. v. 14;) who are, not in form, but in reality, devoted to
   God; and who would be continually waiting for his salvation, (Gen.
   xlix. 18,) with that temper in which you could most desire that
   salvation to find you when it comes.

   III. Let those who have experienced the power of Divine grace
   themselves, study to promote the work of God upon the hearts of others.

   Labor, as much as possible, to spread this temper which God has wrought
   in your hearts; for you cannot but know that with it you spread true
   happiness, which alone is to be found in that intercourse with the
   great Author of our being, for which this lays the foundation, and in
   the regular exercise of those powers which are thus sanctified. No
   sooner was Paul converted himself, but he presently set himself to
   bring others to Christ, and to preach the faith which once he
   destroyed. Gal. i. 13. And David speaks of it as the effects of God's
   pardoning love to him, Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and
   sinners shall be converted unto thee. Psal. li. 13.

   If, therefore, God has called us to the office of the ministry, as the
   experience of this change on our own hearts will be our best
   qualification for our public work, and indeed such a qualification that
   nothing else can supply the want of it; so it will surely excite us in
   a very powerful manner to apply vigorously to this care. That which we
   have not only heard, but seen with our eyes, and looked upon, and
   handled of the word of life, let us declare to others; that their
   fellowship also may be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
   1 John i. 1, 3. Let us declare it in our public discourses, and never
   be ashamed to bear our testimony to that grace to which we are so much
   indebted; to that grace by which we are what we are. 1 Cor. xv. 10. Let
   us warn every man, and teach every man the absolute necessity of
   regeneration; and expose the vanity of all those hopes which are built
   upon any fair outside, on any moral decency of behavior, or any humane
   turn of temper, on any warm flight of imagination or emotion of the
   passions, while the soul continues unrenewed and unsanctified. Let us
   endeavor to save men with fear, pulling them out of the fire, (Jude
   ver. 23,) which, if they are yet unregenerate, is just ready to kindle
   upon them. And let us be often reviewing our respective flocks, that we
   may see who they are, concerning whom there is reason to entertain this
   fear; that proper applications may be made to them in private, as well
   as in public; that joining our admonitions to our sermons, and our
   prayers and examples to both, we may at least deliver our own souls,
   (Ez. xxxiii. 9,) if we cannot deliver theirs. But in proportion to the
   degree that such a spirit prevails in us, there is very great
   encouragement to hope it will be propagated to them, and that our labor
   shall not be in vain in the Lord. 1 Cor. xv. 58.

   And let me beseech you, my beloved hearers in other stations of life,
   that you would not imagine the work is so entirely ours that you have
   nothing to do with it. Are we alone redeemed by the blood of the Son of
   God? Are we alone renewed and sanctified by his grace? Are we alone the
   brethren and friends of mankind, that the generous care and endeavor to
   promote their eternal happiness should be entirely devolved upon us? We
   wish so well to the world, and permit us to say, we wish so well to
   you, to your own religious consolation and establishment, to your
   comfortable account, to your eternal reward, that we can not but
   earnestly exhort you all, even as many as have tasted that the Lord is
   gracious, (1 Peter ii. 3,) that in this respect you join, not only as I
   trust you do, your prayers with ours, but that you also join your
   endeavors.

   Let me particularly address this exhortation to those of you who bear
   any distinguished office in the society, to whom therefore its
   religious interests are dear by additional ties Let me address those of
   you whose age and experience, in the human and the divine life, give
   you something of a natural authority in your application, and command a
   distinguished regard. Look round about you and observe the state of
   religion in your neighborhood; and labor to the utmost to propagate,
   not so much this or that particular opinion or form of worship, but
   real vital Christianity in the world. Bear your testimony to it on all
   proper occasions: be not ashamed of it in your familiar discourse; and
   above all, labor to adorn it by your actions. And when you see any
   under serious impressions, as it is certain they will have a great deal
   discouraging and difficult to break through; and as the devil and his
   instruments, among whom I must necessarily reckon licentious company,
   will be doing their utmost to draw them back into the snare of the
   fowler; let me exhort and charge you to be as solicitous to save as
   others are to destroy. I know how many excuses our cowardly, and
   indolent hearts are ready to find out upon such an occasion: but I
   think those words of Solomon are a sufficient answer to all, and I beg
   you would seriously revolve them; If thou forbear to deliver them that
   are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain: if thou
   sayest, Behold we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart
   consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, thine, Oh Christian, with
   such peculiar and gracious care, doth not he know it? and shall not he
   render to every man according to his works? Prov. xxiv. 11, 12. He will
   assuredly remember, and will abundantly reward, every work of faith,
   and every labor of love; (1 Thes. i. 3;) and we are insensible of our
   own true interest, if we do not see how much it is concerned here.

   Let me especially leave this exhortation with you who are parents and
   heads of families. And one would imagine there should need but little
   importunity in such a case as this: one would think your own hearts
   should speak to you, upon such an occasion, in very pathetic language.
   Look upon your dear children, to whom you have conveyed a nature which
   you know to be degenerate and corrupt; and be earnest in your prayers
   before God, and your endeavors with them, that it may be renewed. And
   take care that you do not in this sense despise the soul of your
   manservant, or of your maid-servant. Job xxxi. 13. God has brought them
   under your care, it may be in those years of life in which, on the one
   hand, they are most capable of being instructed and seriously
   impressed; and in which, on the other hand, they are also most in
   danger of being corrupted. Perhaps their relation to you, and abode
   with you, is the most advantageous circumstance which may occur in
   their whole lives: see therefore that you seize it with a holy
   eagerness; and amidst all the charges you give them relating to your
   own business, neglect not that of the one thing needful; (Luke x. 42;)
   and labor heartily to bring them to the honor and happiness which is
   common to all God's servants, and peculiar to them alone.

   Let me conclude this part of my address with entreating you all to
   express your concern for the souls of others, by your importunate
   prayers to God for them. Pray for the success of gospel ordinances: and
   for a blessing on the labors of all God's faithful servants throughout
   our whole land, of one or another denomination in religion. Yea, pray
   that throughout the whole world, God would revive his work in the midst
   of the years; (Hab. iii. 2;) that the religion of his Son, by which so
   many souls have been regenerated, refined and saved, may be universally
   propagated; and that all who are vigorously engaged in so important,
   though so self-denying a work, may find that the hand of the Lord is
   with them, and multitudes believe and turn unto the Lord; (Acts xi.
   21;) so that his sons may be brought from far, and his daughters from
   the ends of the earth; (Isaiah xliii. 6;) that the barren may rejoice,
   and she that did not travail with child, may break forth into singing,
   and cry aloud; that the children of nations now strangers to Christ,
   may be more than of those that are already espoused to him. Isa. liv.
   1; Gal. iv. 27. And then,

   IV. Let all that are born again, long for that blessed world, where the
   work of God shall be completed, and we shall appear with a dignity and
   glory becoming his children.

   As for God, his work is perfect; (Deut. xxxii. 4;) and the time, the
   happy time is approaching, when we shall know, and the whole world
   shall know, in another manner than we now do, what our heavenly Father
   has intended for us in begetting us to himself. Whatever our
   attainments here may be, we know at present but in part: (1 Cor. xiii.
   9;) and with whatever integrity of soul we now walk before God, we are
   sanctified but in part: and hereupon we find, and must expect to find,
   the flesh striving against the Spirit, as well as the Spirit against
   the flesh: so that, in many respects, we cannot do the things that we
   would. Gal. v. 17. In proportion to the degree in which our nature is
   refined and brightened, we are more sensible of the evil of these
   corruptions that remain within us; so that though we are not, in a
   strict propriety of speech, carnal and sold under sin, but do indeed
   delight in the law of God after the inward man, (Rom. vii. 14, 22,) yet
   in the humility of our hearts we are often borrowing that pathetic
   complaint, Oh, wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
   body of this death? Verse 24.

   But let it be remembered, Christians, as the matter of your joy, that
   the struggle shall not be perpetual, that it shall not indeed be long.
   Look up with pleasure then, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
   draweth nigh. Luke xxi. 28. The time is approaching, when that which is
   perfect shall come, and that which is in part shall be done away. 1
   Cor. xiii. 10. You are now the children of GOD; but it does not appear
   to every eye that you are so: the world knows us not. 1 John iii. 1, 2.
   Nor are we to wonder at it: for even Christ our Lord was once unknown,
   and appeared in so much meanness, and so much calamity, that an
   undiscerning and carnal eye could not have discovered who and what he
   was. But there is a day appointed for the manifestation of the sons of
   GOD, (Rom. viii. 19,) as the apostle Paul most happily expresses it;
   when he will manifest them to each other, and manifest them also to the
   whole world. They shall not always live thus at a distance from their
   Father's house, and under those dispensations of Providence that look
   so much like disregard and neglect; but he will take them home, and
   gather them to himself. Ere long, Christians, he will call these
   heaven-born spirits of yours, that are now aspiring towards him, to
   dwell in his immediate presence: he will receive you to himself; and
   you shall stand, where no sinner shall have a place, in the
   congregation of the righteous, (Ps. ii. 5,) and shall have an
   inheritance among the saints in light, the saints in holiness and
   glory.

   O happy day! when dropping this body in the grave, we shall ascend pure
   and joyful spirits to that triumphant assembly, where there is not one
   vitiated affection, not one foolish thought to be found among the
   thousands and ten thousands of God's Israel! O blessed period of a
   regenerate state I Though all the schemes of the Divine love were to
   rest here, and these bodies were forever to be laid aside, and utterly
   to be lost in the grave; the rejoicing soul might say, "Lord, it is
   enough!" And it might be indeed enough for us; but it is not enough to
   answer the gracious purposes of God's paternal love. God will show, in
   the most conspicuous manner, what a family he has raised to himself
   among the children of men; and therefore he will assemble them all in
   their complete persons, and will do it with solemn pomp and magnificent
   parade. He will for this purpose send his own Son, with all his holy
   angels, (Matt. xxv. 31,) and will cause the bodies of millions of his
   children, that have long dwelt in the dust, to spring out of it, at
   once in forms of beauty and lustre, worthy their relation to him. This,
   therefore, is, with beautiful propriety, called by the apostle the
   adoption, even the redemption of our body; (Rom. viii. 23;) alluding to
   the public ceremony, with which adoptions among the ancients were
   solemnly confirmed and declared, after they had been more privately
   transacted between the parties immediately concerned.

   O, Christians, how reasonable is it that our souls should be rising
   with a secret ardor towards this blessed hope, this glorious abode!--It
   is pleasant for the children of God to meet and converse with one
   another upon earth; so pleasant, that I wonder they do not more
   frequently form themselves into little societies, in which, under that
   character, they should join their discourses and their prayers. It is
   delightful to address those that, we trust, through grace are born of
   God. No discourses are more pleasant than those that suit them: and
   could we, that are the ministers of Christ, reasonably hope, that we
   had none but such to attend our labors, we should joyfully confine our
   discourses to such subjects. Yet while we are here, we see
   imperfections in others, we feel them yet more painfully in ourselves:
   and as there is no pure, unmixed society, no fellowship on earth that
   is completely holy and without blemish, so there is now no pure
   delight, no perfect pleasure to be met with here. Oh when shall I
   depart from this mixed society, and reach that state where all is good,
   all glorious: where I shall see my heavenly Father, and all my brethren
   in the Lord; and shall behold them all forever acting up to their
   character! All giving thanks to the Father, who has made us meet to be
   partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light! Col. i. 12. All
   forever blessing and serving the great Redeemer; and without one
   ungenerous action, one reflecting word, one suspicious thought, forever
   serving each other in love, rejoicing in each other's happiness, and
   with the most prudent and steadfast application forever studying and
   laboring to improve it!

   With the most earnest desire that you, my dear brethren and friends,
   may at length attain to this state of perfection and glory; and with a
   cheerful expectation, through Divine grace, that I shall ere long meet
   many of you in it, I close this sermon, and these discourses: not
   without an humble hope, that when we arrive at this blessed world,
   these hours, which we have spent together in the house of God, in
   attending them, will come into a pleasant remembrance; and that the God
   of all grace, to whose glory they are faithfully devoted, and to whose
   blessing they are humbly committed, will honor them as the means of
   increasing his family, as well as of feeding and quickening those who
   are already his regenerate children!--Amen.

POSTSCRIPT.

  MEANING OP THE WORD REGENERATION.

   To what I have said in the conclusion of the first discourse concerning
   the proper import of the word Regeneration, I beg leave to add the
   following remarks for the farther satisfaction of some worthy persons,
   who think it may be convenient to state the matter a little more
   particularly.

   I ACKNOWLEDGE that many learned and pious divines have taught and
   contended, that Regeneration does, in the strictest propriety of
   speech, signify Baptism--so that no unbaptized person, how well
   disposed soever, can properly be said to be regenerated; whereas that
   title may justly be given to all who have been baptized, how destitute
   soever they might have been of Christian faith and holiness when they
   received the ordinance, or how grossly soever they may since have
   forfeited the final blessings of a regenerate state. Dr. Waterland has
   stated this matter at large in his labored and ingenious treatise on
   the subject, which is the best I know on this side of the question. And
   though this would be a very improper place to enter on a critical
   examination of that piece, I will briefly touch on the chief arguments
   which he, or others in his sentiments, have urged in vindication of
   this favorite notion. So far as I can recollect, what they say is
   capable of being reduced to two heads;--that Christian antiquity uses
   the word in this sense;--and that there are passages of Scripture which
   authorize such an application of it.

   As to the first of these, I readily own that the word has this sense in
   the generality of the Christian writers, from about the middle of the
   second century, though I think not so universally as some have
   concluded: [11] but I think it easy to account for such a use of it
   among them. For in the earliest ages of the church, persons were
   generally baptized as soon as they were converted to the cordial belief
   of Christianity; and therefore the time of their conversion, and that
   of their baptism, might naturally enough be spoken of as one: and as
   this was a period when they did, as it were, come into a new world, it
   is no wonder that the action by which they testified a change so lately
   made, should be put for that change itself. Just as illumination also
   among the ancients signifies baptism: not to intimate that the grand
   illumination of the mind was made by this rite, or at the time of it;
   for that would be supposing the person in darkness when he embraced the
   Gospel, and determined to be baptized: but because it was taken for
   granted, and that very justly in those days, that every one savingly
   enlightened would soon be baptized, that so he might be regularly
   joined to the society of enlightened or regenerated persons, that is,
   to the Christian church: which no doubt had the best right of any body
   of men in the world to that title, though in its purest state it
   contained some ignorant and wicked members.

   In a word, a man by baptism solemnly professed himself a Christian; and
   as it was generally the first overt act by which his believing the
   Gospel could be publicly and generally known, and was also supposed to
   be very near the time of his inward conversion, they dated his
   regeneration, that is, his happy change (as that word used to signify
   even among the heathen [12] ) from that time. We own therefore that
   these ancient Christians (of whom I always think and speak with great
   respect) had a very good excuse for this method of speaking: but
   whether they were perfectly accurate in this, and whether they did not
   recede from the scripture use of the word, may be matter of farther
   inquiry.

   As to the arguments from Scripture in support of the interpretation I
   oppose, they are taken partly from particular places; but chiefly, as I
   apprehend, from the general tenor of it, in which Christians are spoken
   of as regenerated.

   The particular texts are John iii. 5, and Tit. iii. 5, on which much of
   the stress of this controversy is laid; but on considering them
   attentively, I find nothing in either of them to lead us to think
   baptism the regeneration spoken of there.

   As to the former of them, John iii. 5, when our Lord says, Except a man
   be born of water, and of the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom
   of GOD; it is (after all the contempt with which that interpretation
   has been treated) very possible he may mean, by a well-known figure, to
   express one idea by both those clauses, that is, the purifying
   influences of the Spirit cleansing the mind, as water does the body: as
   elsewhere, to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire, (Matt.
   iii. 11,) signifies to be baptized by the Spirit operating like fire.
   But if there is indeed a reference to baptism in these words (which I
   own I am much inclined to believe) it will by no means follow that
   baptism is Regeneration. On that supposition, I still think the sense
   of the passage must be that which I have given in my paraphrase on it
   (Fam. Expos. vol. I. p. 148-p. 57 Am. Ed.) "Whosoever would become a
   regular member of the kingdom of God, must not only be baptized, but as
   ever he desires to share in its spiritual and eternal blessings, must
   experience the renewing and sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit
   on his soul, to cleanse it from the power of corruption, and to animate
   and quicken it to a spiritual and Divine life." It is granted
   therefore, that how excellent soever any man's character is, he must be
   baptized before he can be looked upon as completely a member of the
   church of Christ; and that, in general, being born of the Spirit, he
   will also be solicitous that he may be born of water, and so fulfill
   all righteousness. But it will never follow from hence, that being born
   of water and born of the Spirit are the same thing. The text rather
   implies they are different; and I think every body must own, they may
   be actually separate.

   Nothing therefore can be more absurd than to infer from this text, that
   if there be two persons, one of whom is born of the Spirit, and not of
   water; another of water, and not of the Spirit; the latter, that is,
   the wicked man, who has perhaps with some iniquitous design been
   baptized, may properly be said to be regenerated, or born of GOD, and
   consequently to be an heir of GOD, (Rom. viii. 17,) rather than a truly
   religious man who has not yet been baptized, either through want of
   opportunity, or through some unhappy mistake, as to the nature and
   design, or the perpetuity and obligations of that ordinance. Now this I
   take to be precisely the question, and must declare that when a
   baptized person is destitute of true religion, that birth which he had
   by water, seems to me as it were an evanescent thing, or a thing which
   disappears as unworthy the mention; and that it must be therefore most
   safe and advisable, as well as most agreeable to the scripture sense,
   to appropriate the title of regenerate persons to those sanctified by
   Divine grace, rather than to use it of all who are baptized.

   As to the text in Titus (chap. iii. 5,) where God is said to save us by
   the washing of regeneration, or, as some earnestly contend it should be
   rendered, by the laver of regeneration: I might answer, that as that
   interpretation is by no means necessary, [13] it cannot be proved that
   baptism is here designed; though I acknowledge there may be a graceful
   allusion to it. The Apostle may mean, we are saved by GOD'S washing our
   hearts by his sanctifying Spirit (a phrase so often used in the Old
   Testament) and thereby making us his children: and in this sense it
   might have been used, though baptism had never been instituted. But
   granting (as I have done) that Loutron may be rendered laver, and that
   baptism may be the laver referred to; and that "there is indeed an
   allusion to the washing new-born children; (as Mr. Mede in his diatribe
   on this text contends;) I think this text will be so far from proving
   that St. Paul meant to call baptism Regeneration, that it will prove
   the contrary: for regeneration itself, and the laver of regeneration,
   can not be the same thing. And whatever Tertullian and other ancients
   may fancifully talk of our being generated like fishes in the water, in
   a weak allusion to the technical word IChThUS, (a fish,) common sense
   will see how absurd it would be to apply this to a child, and will
   teach us rather to argue, that as children must be born before they can
   be washed, so they must be regenerated before the washing of
   regeneration (that is, the washing which belongs to their new birth,)
   can be applied to them. But on the whole, I am more and more inclined
   to think there is no reference at all here to a laver, or to the
   washing new-born children; and therefore, that this washing and the
   renewing of the Holy Ghost are exegetical, and that the latter clause
   might be rendered, even the renewing, &c, which makes the text decisive
   for the sense in which I use the word.

   After all, then, if any argument can be deduced from scripture in favor
   of the manner of speaking now in debate, it must be from the general
   tenor of it; according to which it seems that all who are members of
   the visible church are spoken of as regenerate; from which it may be
   inferred, with some plausible probability at least, that baptism, by
   which they are admitted into that society, may be called Regeneration.
   And I am ready to believe, as I hinted above, that this was the chief
   reason why the ancients so often used the word in the sense I am now
   opposing.

   Now with relation to this, I desire it may be recollected, that when
   Christianity first appeared in the world, it was attended with such
   discouragements, as made the very profession of it, in a great measure,
   a test of men's characters. The Apostles therefore, knowing the number
   of hypocrites to be comparatively very small, generally take no notice
   of them, but address themselves to whole bodies of Christians, as if
   they were truly what they professed to be. Just as our Lord Jesus
   Christ, though he knew the wickedness of Judas, often addressed himself
   to the whole body of his Apostles, as if they were all his faithful
   servants, and makes gracious declarations and promises to the whole
   society, which could by no means be applicable to this one corrupt and
   wretched member of it; telling them, for instance, that they should
   share in his final triumph, and sit on twelve thrones, judging the
   twelve tribes of Israel. Matt. xix. 28.

   This is therefore the true key to all those passages in which
   Christians are, in the general, said to be adopted, sanctified,
   justified, &c., as well as regenerated. The Apostles had reason, in the
   judgment of charity, to think thus of by far the greatest part of them;
   and therefore they speak to them all, as in such a happy state. And
   agreeably to this, we find not only such privileges, but also such
   characters, ascribed to Christians in general, as were only applicable
   to such of them as were Christians indeed. Thus all the Corinthians are
   spoken of by the Apostle Paul, as waiting for the coming of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, (1 Cor. i. 7,) and all the Ephesians, and all the
   Colossians, as having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and love to all
   the saints, (Eph. i. 15; Col. i. 4,) and all the Philippians, as having
   a good work begun in them, which Paul was persuaded GOD would perfect,
   (Phil. i. 6,) and all the Thessalonians, as remarkable for their work
   of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope; (1 Thess. i. 3;)
   though it evidently appears there were persons in several of these
   churches who behaved much amiss, and to whom, had he been particularly
   addressing each of them alone, he could not by any means have used such
   language. On the like principles Peter, when addressing all the
   Christians in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, speaks
   of the whole aggregate of them, (1 Pet. i. 8,) as loving an unseen
   Saviour, and amidst all their tribulations, rejoicing in him with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory; though probably there were some weak and
   dejected Christians among them, and undoubtedly in so large an extent
   of country, in which there were such a vast number of churches, not a
   few, who (as our Lord afterwards expresses it of some of them) had only
   a name to live, while they were dead; (Rev. iii. 1:) in which passage,
   by the way, our Lord uses the same figure, and describes the whole body
   by the character of those who made the greater of it.

   I state the matter thus particularly, because I think this obvious
   remark is a sufficient answer to what is most peculiar and important in
   a late Discourse, consisting of near 130 quarto pages, and entitled A
   Key to the Apostolic Writings, &c., prefixed by the Rev. Mr. Taylor, of
   Norwich, to his late Paraphrase and Notes on the Romans. [14] I think
   what I have briefly advanced here, will much more effectually answer
   the end of fixing the true sense of the scripture phrases in question.
   And I cannot forbear saying, that to determine the sense of the words
   called, redeemed, sanctified, &c., when applied to the Christian
   church, by that in which they are used in Moses and the prophets with
   respect to the whole people of Israel, seems to me as unreasonable, as
   it would be to maintain, that the dimensions, the strength, and the
   beauty of a body are to be most exactly estimated by looking on its
   shadow.

   Yet on this evidently weak and mistaken principle, the learned and
   ingenious Author referred to above, ventures not only to attempt an
   entire alteration in the generally-received strain of theological
   Discourses, but to throw out a censure, which, considering its extent
   and its severity, must either be very terrible, or very pitiable. He
   not only seems to think, if I understand him right, that we were all
   regenerated (if at all) as well as justified, in those of our parents
   who were first converted from idolatry to Christianity, (Key, § 81, 82,
   and 246,) as indeed he expressly says, "that we are born in a
   justified," and therefore undoubtedly, (if the word is to be retained,)
   in a regenerate "state:" but he presumes to say, that such doctrines as
   have been almost universally taught and received among Christians,
   concerning "Justification, regeneration, redemption, &c., have quite
   taken away the very ground of the Christian life, the grace of God, and
   have left no object for the faith of a sinner to work upon." (§ 357.)
   And hereupon, lest it should be forgot, he repeats it in the same
   section, that to represent it as "the subject of doubtful inquiry,
   trial, and examination, whether we have an interest in Christ, whether
   we are in a state of pardon, whether we be adopted, (and by
   consequence, to be sure, whether we be regenerated,) "is" (as the
   Antinomians I imagine would also say,) "to make our justification, as
   it invests us in those blessings, to be of works, and not by faith
   alone;" and (as we just before said in the same words,) "to take away
   the very ground of the Christian life, the grace of God, and to leave
   no object for the faith of a sinner to act upon." And this way of
   stating things, which has so generally prevailed, is joined with the
   wickedness and contentions of professing Christians, as a third cause
   of that disregard to the Gospel which is so common in the present day.

   Now as no book can fall more directly under this censure, than this of
   mine, in which, it is the business of the first three discourses to
   direct professing Christians into an inquiry, whether they be or be not
   in a regenerate state; I thought it not improper, in this postscript,
   briefly to acquaint my reader with the principles on which I continue
   to think the view, in which I have put the matter, to be rational and
   scriptural, [15] and do still in my conscience judge it far preferable
   to what the advocates of baptismal regeneration on the one hand, or Dr.
   Taylor on the other, would introduce.

   It seems to me, that the points in dispute with him are much more
   important than our debates with them, as a much greater number of
   Scriptures are concerned, and the whole tenor of our ministerial
   addresses would be much more sensibly affected. Had I leisure to
   discuss the matter more largely with this gentleman, I should think it
   might be an important service to the Gospel of Christ. I hope it will
   be undertaken by some abler hand; and shall, in the mean time, go on
   preaching and writing in the manner so solemnly condemned, with no
   apprehension from the discharge of all this overloaded artillery,
   except it be what I feel for the zealous engineer himself, and a few
   other friends who may chance to stand nearer him than in prudence they
   ought.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [11] Clemens Alexandrinus, so often, and to be sure reasonably, quoted
   on the other side, plainly uses the word for a change of character by
   true repentance; (Strom. lib. ii. page 425,) where, speaking of a
   penitent harlot, he says, "that being born again by conversion, or a
   change in her temper and behavior, she has the regeneration of life:"
   anagennetheisa kata ten episstophen tou biou palingenesian echei zoes.

   [12] It is well known that Cicero expresses the happy change made in
   his state, when restored from his banishment, by this word. (Cic. ad
   Attic. lib. vi. Epist. 6.) The Greeks expressed by it the doctrine of
   the Brahmans, in which they affirmed our entering on a new state of
   being after death. (Clem. Alex. Strom. lib. iii. pag. 451.) And the
   Stoics used it to denote their expected renovation of the world after
   successive conflagrations. (Marc. Antonin. Medit. lib. xi. § l. v. 13,
   x. 7. See Lucian, Oper. pag. 532. Euseb. Præp: Evang. ex numen. lib.
   xv. chap. 19. Phil. Jud. de Mundi Immort. pag. 940, 951, and in many
   other places.) And so the fathers often use it to signify the
   resurrection which Christians expect. (See Euseb. Eccl. Hist. lib. v.
   chap. 1. in fin.) Compare Matt. xix. 28, and the Note there: Fam.
   Expos. Vol. II. pag. 238.

   [13] The original is dia loutrou palungenesias. Now it is certain the
   seventy use another word, that is Louter, to signify Laver, Exod. xxx.
   18, 28; xxxi. 9; and I think (so far as I have observed) everywhere
   else: and Loutron (St. Paul's word here) is used where it can not
   signify laver, for the water in which sheep are washed, Cant. iv. 2,
   and for a large quantity of water in which an adult person was washed
   or bathed. Eph. v. 26. And this remark quite overthrows all the
   argument from this text, if any argument would follow from rendering it
   laver: but I think I need not urge this.

   [14] And with singular inconsistency adopted by Dr. Adam Clarke, in his
   Commentary on the New Testament, now so widely circulated.--J. N. B.

   [15] For the full proof of this, that it is the most scriptural sense,
   I must desire the reader diligently to examine, and seriously to
   consider, the several texts which are quoted in the foregoing
   Discourses. Let it still be remembered, that to be regenerated, and to
   be born of GOD, are equivalent phrases: And with this remark, let any
   one that can do it paraphrase all the passages referred to, in two
   different views; first putting the word baptism for regeneration, and
   baptized persons for born of GOD; and then substituting our definition
   of regeneration or of a regenerate person, instead of the words
   themselves: and I can not but think he will be struck with that
   demonstration, which will (as it were) emerge of itself upon such a
   trial. And I must add, that if he looks into the context of many of
   these passages, he will at the same time see how utterly ungrounded it
   is to assert, as some have done, "that regeneration is only used when
   applied to Jewish converts to Christianity, referring to their former
   birth from Abraham;" a notion so fully confuted by our Lord's discourse
   with Nicodemus, John iii. 3, et seq. by Tit. iii. 5, and by 1 Pet. i.
   3, 23; ii. 2, when compered with 1 Pet. i. 14: iv. 3, (which proves
   that the Apostle there wrote to societies, of which the greater part
   had before been idolatrous Gentiles.)
