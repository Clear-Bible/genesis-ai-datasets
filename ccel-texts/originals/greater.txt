   By Jan H. Boer

   Translator


               Miracles, spiritual healing, demons and angels - these and
   related topics are once again high on the Christian agenda.   I say
   "once again," for in the days of the Bible and during many centuries of
   Christian history these were topics of utmost concern to people of all
   continents, of all cultures and of most religions, including the
   Christian religion.  It is only the last couple of centuries that the
   very reality of these practices and forces has been challenged,
   particularly in the Western world.

               Though I welcome their return on the agenda, that does not
   mean I fully endorse the way these items have returned or the theology
   that supports this return.  That theology is often too narrow in its
   scope to the point of frivolity.  In the Nigerian context, its easy
   acceptance by Christians of all stripes, regardless of their
   denominations, can be explained partially because these concerns are so
   deeply Biblical and partially because they are so similar to major
   concerns in our traditional religion.

               I offer you a translation of a discussion on these subjects
   originally written by Abraham Kuyper.  Kuyper (1837-1920) was a pastor,
   theologian in the Reformed or Calvinist tradition, a Christian
   philosopher, Christian politician, Christian educator in The
   Netherlands.  He even served as Prime Minister of his country.  His
   stimulation led to the establishment of a Christian educational system,
   a full-fledged university, a Christian political party, a Christian
   press and led to the formation of a truly pluralistic state, in
   distinction from a secular one, that created structural and
   institutional room for all major persuasions in the country.  He was
   also a prolific writer.  Furthermore, he was a progenitor of liberation
   theology.  It was one of his conscious aims to free the common people
   of his country from oppression by the government, the state church and
   other forces.  That battle he won.  He placed such an imprint on his
   country that more than 70 years after his death, one cannot understand
   his country without reference to Kuyper.

      I offer you this translation because of what he writes about
   miracles, healing, demons and how he relates all of these to science.
   It is not everyday that a successful politician and social crusader
   writes about subjects today largely associated with the charismatic
   movement.  Too often discussion on these subjects are far removed from
   the social, economic, political and scientific developments in which
   they take place.  Too often this discussion is narrowed down and has so
   little relationship to other aspects of life that much of it seems
   trivial.  In contrast to this situation, Kuyper's discussion is
   WHOLISTIC.  That is, he places these concerns in a very broad framework
   and relates them to many other aspects of culture.  It is this
   wholistic approach that renders his affirmation of these phenomena so
   unique.  He frees these concerns from the realm of the trivial and puts
   them squarely in the middle of history, science and other cultural
   developments.

               The book in which this material is found is a three-volume
   work entitled Pro Rege.  The entire 3-volume work represents a
   wholistic exposition of the Kingdom of Christ and covers wide areas of
   cultural life in The Netherlands in particular and in Western Europe in
   general.  Students of Kuyper and students struggling with the
   integration of the Christian faith and life often refer to this work of
   Kuyper.  However, in keeping with the long-standing Western skepticism
   with respect to the world of spirits and powers, I do not know of a
   single reference to this part of Pro Rege on the part of researchers.

               Underlying this wholistic emphasis is the Cultural Mandate
   of Gen. 1:26-28, the very first command in the Bible, the command to
   rule and develop this world.  Kuyper's interest in the world has its
   basis on this Mandate.  It is this mandate that prevents him from
   separating the spiritual and material into distinct compartments.  It
   leads him to explore the relationship between scientific and spiritual
   affairs.  Science and other cultural activities derive their importance
   from the God-given mandate to rule and develop creation.  Sin has
   incapacitated the human race from doing so adequately, but Christ and
   His Sprit have liberated the human spirit from the idolatry of nature
   and thus freed mankind to fulfill its mandate. [1]

               An additional but related reason for offering you this
   translation is that English-speaking Evangelical Christians are trying
   to find alternatives to their social irrelevance of the last century,
   an alternative that remains true to the basics of the Gospel.  For this
   reason, interest in Kuyperiana is increasing amongst them, for he seems
   to offer a kind of model to a wider Christian approach to the
   world--but language is a barrier.  Hence, when I informed some of my
   friends on the staff of Fuller School of World Missions in Pasadena,
   California, about this project, they enthusiastically encouraged me to
   proceed and make this material more widely accessible.

               Kuyper's works are, of course, marked by the time and
   culture in which he lived, though because of his prophetic spirit, he
   was y no means bound by them.  He writes that it is difficult to
   understand the fear that people of earlier or other contemporary
   cultures have for nature.  Yes, difficult for someone of his time and
   culture, but not for Africans.  He struggles against the Western idea
   of a universe closed to spiritual influences and forces.  That was
   necessary in his context but hardly for Africans who are deeply and
   experientially aware of the reality of the world of spirits.  He refers
   to developments in the arts, but ignores African art since he knew
   nothing about it.

               In spite of these alien elements, Kuyper's struggle is very
   relevant for us in Nigeria, for most Christian missionaries came from
   the West and were afflicted with typical Western blindness with respect
   to much of the spiritual world.  Their blindness is part of the
   inheritance of many mission churches in the country and it has rendered
   much of the established church powerless over against the world of the
   spirits and helpless over against many kinds of sickness.  The upsurge
   of charismatic churches is a reaction to that powerlessness inherited
   from Western missionaries.  Kuyper challenged that blindness and
   powerlessness at the home front not only, but also explains it.  His
   discussion goes far in helping us understand that weakness in the
   missionary movement, even though his focus was on his own culture
   rather than the cultures that were targets of missionary activity in
   his day.  Charles Kraft's book Christianity With Power [2] represents a
   more recent treatment of the same missionary weakness, a very fine
   treatment, but lacking the comprehensive view of the work of the Holy
   Spirit in cultures affirmed by Kuyper.

               This translated segment of Pro Rege betrays a degree of
   cultural optimism along with a high view of Western culture, both of
   which constitute a second foreign element.  To some degree, Kuyper
   shared this optimism and appreciation with his contemporary Europeans.
   He was deeply appreciative of science and technology and had great
   expectations from them.  He could hardly be expected to have foreseen
   the problems we recognize today with respect to these modern
   phenomena.  He was also impressed by the deep impact the Christian
   faith had made on Western culture and by the relative superiority this
   faith had given Europe.  Yet, Kuyper was more critical of the
   undercurrents of his own culture than most of his contemporaries.  In
   fact, Pro Rege was written to counteract much of that culture's
   tendencies.  Those familiar with the body of Kuyperiana know how deeply
   aware he was of the shortcomings, not to speak of decadence, of his
   culture, especially in the spiritual-philosophical realm.  He was among
   the foremost opponents of the colonial rape of many Southern peoples.
   [3]

               Kuyper had many unusual ideas about miracles and the
   demonic world.  He was not afraid to go against the grain of popular
   opinion of his day on these subjects.  The traditional Christian view
   was that miracles and so-called "faith healing" belong to the distant
   Christian past.  They were neither necessary anymore nor possible.
   Kuyper rejected this opinion and strongly affirmed their continued
   relevance today and their possibility.  Miracles, according to Kuyper
   are still possible, and so is faith healing.

               Probably the most novel aspect of Kuyper's view of miracles
   is that he regards them as belonging to human nature.  If it were not
   for the fall into sin, the power to perform miracles would be common to
   all of us.  When Christ performed miracles, He did so not as the Son of
   God, but as the Son of Man, as the representative of the restored human
   race.

               Another intriguing aspect of Kuyper's view on miracles is
   his emphasis on the fact the power to perform miracles has been
   retained by various practitioners of traditional and Muslim religions.
   While today's Christians tend to deny followers of those other
   religions that power and often relate it to the world of tricks and
   deceit, Kuyper points to the Egyptian wise men of Moses' days as well
   as to the plain and undeniable reports of such powers brought to his
   attention by returned missionaries.  It is time modern Christians once
   again acknowledge these powers.  Kuyper's explanation for this
   phenomenon is deeply satisfactory and can help us come to grips with
   them.

               We must be careful not to jump to premature conclusions.
   While various Christian communities are known to reject medical science
   in favour of so-called "faith healing," in line with the Cultural
   Mandate, Kuyper holds science in high regard and thinks of it in terms
   of the "greater works" of John 14:12.  He strongly rejects any
   dichotomy or incompatibility between medical science and faith healing,
   while he condemns those who resort exclusively to faith healing.
   Medical science, along with science in general, is a great gift from
   God through Christ.  Science is thus not something secular that has
   nothing to do with Christ or religion. [4]   But while Kuyper has high
   regard for the Christian origin of science, he also realizes that
   science is often practiced in a secular or ungodly spirit.  I will
   leave it up to you, the reader, to discover how Kuyper explains this
   apparent contradiction.

               Kuyper repeatedly insists on the reality of the demonic
   world.  He rejects all Western attempts at reasoning that world out of
   existence on basis of pseudo-scientific arguments.  He insists that the
   central thrust of Christ's ministry on earth was to defeat the
   demonic.  To rationalize that world out of existence is not only
   unrealistic, but it also takes the heart out of Christ's work.

               I have personally met Nigerian Muslim Malams who, after
   their conversion to Christ, insisted on having practiced all kinds of
   demonic powers on various victims.  Only today did I hear the testimony
   of a young man consciously devoted by his parents to the demonic world
   from his childhood on into adulthood.  He told me of the wicked and
   awesome powers he possessed during that stage in his life.  Through a
   dramatic conversion experience he escaped from the clutches of demonic
   powers.  To maintain that kind of emphasis in a secular culture took a
   great deal of courage for a man of Kuyper's standing.

               The Nigerian church has long suffered from a missionary
   heritage of dichotomy of spirit and material.  We tend to divide life
   into water-tight religious and non-religious compartments, into
   spiritual and non-spiritual affairs.  This dualistic division has long
   prevented Christians in Nigeria from entering politics.  The Western
   church is often rightly accused of having reduced the Gospel to mere
   spiritual dimensions and of thereby having trivialized, marginalized it
   in society.  Kuyper represents that part of the Reformed tradition that
   formed an exception to this Western tradition; he strongly rejected any
   such compartmentalization.  You will find him a strong advocate of
   integration of life and religion, one keenly aware of the interplay of
   the spiritual and the material.  These cannot and should not be
   compartmentalized; they belong together.  Because of this integration
   of the spiritual and material, Kuyper became a great reformer in both
   church and society.

               Finally, it must be acknowledged that, while Kuyper was an
   original thinker and a powerful writer, he did not allow himself the
   time to write carefully or to edit.  From a technical point of view,
   his writings suffer from certain defects.  Frequent repetition and poor
   organization mar his style.  When it comes to writing, he himself is an
   example of the instinctive approach he describes in these pages.  Dutch
   readers may notice that I have made occasional attempts to correct
   these problems where they went out of hand.

               I doubt that it is necessary to emphasize that I am not
   prepared to defend all Kuyper's statements or claims.  Nevertheless, I
   offer this translation to you in the firm conviction that its
   perspective can serve us as a corrective in the area of spirits and
   healing not only, but also help us get rid of our dualisms and the
   subsequent "Christian" trivialities in our lives.

Chapter 1

                                    MIRACLES

               Anyone seeking to understand miracles must keep in mind the
   painful struggle in which the human race is involved against nature.
   In this struggle, the human race is at a disadvantage.  While humanity
   is seriously weakened by the curse of sin, that same curse has
   increased the power of nature.  Nature appears to be more powerful than
   the spiritual.

               This situation led long ago to the deification or idolizing
   of nature that became the object of worship.  The human race, stricken
   with fear, gradually transferred the adoration that is reserved for the
   living God to nature.  These fears did not arise when nature was in
   restful repose, but only when it was in a state of turbulence and
   agitation.  It does not really make any difference whether, as in some
   cases, this fear was the result of what people suffered directly at the
   hands of nature itself or whether, as in some other cases, it arose
   because people thought to detect the work of evil spirits behind
   nature's violence.  In either case the dominant concern constantly was
   how to escape from the threatening power of nature when it is agitated.

               Take the sea, for example.  When the sea is quiet, it is
   most enjoyable and restful to walk along the beach or to take to the
   water in a rowboat or sailboat.  But once a storm begins to break
   loose, waves as high as mountains can in no time flat demolish the boat
   and render the beach into a place of death and destruction.  There is
   no way people can control the threatening waves when this happens.
   They are totally helpless over against them.  Nature, when it is quiet,
   can quicken one's spirit and soothe one's heart, but when it becomes
   violent, it arouses fear and horror.  Over against such fearful terrors
   people feel helpless not only in themselves, but it also seems as if
   God Himself is overwhelmed by it all and quite powerless.

               The above scenario has led to the transfer of adoration
   from God to nature with all of its turbulence and violence.  In other
   cases, it has led to an animistic fear of the spirits that supposedly
   used the forces of nature for their own evil purposes.  Under these
   conditions, it was only when God displayed His superior power over
   nature and over these spirits by means of miracles that the fear of God
   could remain a reality in the hearts of men at all.

               Only in this context do both the necessity as well as the
   great significance of miracles become clear to us.  It is impossible to
   understand miracles without considering sin, the curse and their effect
   on creation.  It is safe to say that rejection of the reality of
   miracles is caused by the failure to recognize the significance and
   reality of these factors.

               Over against the powers of nature, fallen mankind was at a
   disadvantage.  It was weak in both body and spirit.  The powers given
   mankind at creation slowly but surely waned after the fall. Take the
   human life span, for example.  At first, we read of our ancestors
   living nearly 1,000 years but this is slowly reduced so that later we
   are promised an average of three score years and ten (70 years).
   Diseases of all kinds reared their heads.  As the generations went by,
   these diseases and other negative forces undermined human resistance.

               It is for this reason that many cultures have stories of
   ancient ancestors that were very powerful and strong, stories of
   Nimrods and giants, of descendants of Anak to whom the Israelites
   seemed like mere grasshoppers (Numb. 13:33).  Alas, subsequent
   generations, even those of OT Israel, continuously deteriorated and
   weakened.

               The deterioration of spirit was even worse than that of the
   body.  Instead of attacking nature together, people began to attack
   each other.  Cain murdered Abel.  Murder and hatred became common among
   people.  Human conscience was defiled, which, in turn killed morale and
   courage.  Mankind lost its awareness of its position of superiority
   over against nature.  Fear replaced courage and reduced the inner
   resilience of the human soul.  A soul tormented by fear cannot but lose
   its resilience.  And thus it was that mankind experienced increasing
   weakness and helplessness over against a nature that appeared to rule
   and threaten all of life.

               The human race, severely weakened by sin, was in
   confrontation with a nature with a greatly increased power.  It is
   extremely difficult for us today to form an adequate picture of the
   curse that came over nature. [5] Perhaps it is best to think of nature
   as having gone berserk, because of the weight of the curse under which
   it had to labour.  We all know how a berserk person can sometimes be
   very strong.  Three or more people may be needed to overcome such a
   person.  The same is sometimes true for a drunk person.  It often takes
   special effort to overcome a drunken madman.  It is not unheard of for
   a people, before they start a war, to prepare themselves by heavy
   drinking.  Intoxicants tend to increase one's courage and strength and
   make one reckless.

               Such increase in strength characterizes berserk persons
   even more than drunk people.  The anger that comes with being berserk
   can heighten the victim's physical power beyond that of an ordinary
   person.  Being berserk causes a radical transformation in the nature or
   personality of its victim.  He stands before you totally venomous and
   obnoxious, apparently without any redeeming features.  A person, whom
   you normally know as calm and collected, suddenly attacks his wife, his
   children or even his parents.  He may try to torment and kill them.
   His emotions, his expressions, in short, his entire personality has
   been transformed into a totally different being.  He attacks his
   environment with destructive powers.  Anyone who tries to tame or
   restrain him will experience the full force of an anger aggravated by
   this strangely heightened strength.

               The above image is an example of nature after it was
   distorted by the curse of sin.  Just like a berserk person, nature has
   its moments of calm and quiet, but this is often interrupted by periods
   of violence and anger that stir up all of creation and threaten
   destruction everywhere.  The earth quakes; cyclones pick up homes and
   hurl them down to the ground; tempestuous gales anger the ocean waves;
   rivers burst beyond their banks.  At such times, it may seem as if all
   nature is hell-bent on destruction.  The curse has totally transformed
   nature into an ominous threat.  What used to be peaceful has become
   violent.  Plants sprout thorns and thistles.  Animals have become wild
   and roam about devouring their fellows.  Sickness and pestilence abound
   everywhere.

               All of nature constitutes one organic unity.  The curse has
   entered the very core of that organic whole and all of its spheres and
   aspects.  Destruction has wormed its way into the very marrow of the
   system and from there its effect radiates throughout all of its parts.
   Indeed, it confronts the human race like one gone berserk.

               In the Garden of Eden nature embraced our race with a
   disarming love and protected it, but now, driven by the curse, it
   appears as if this same nature directs its anger especially to the
   object of its former special love and leaps upon the human race to
   torment it, to squelch it, to vent every possible violence upon it
   until it is totally annihilated.  The power of this cursed nature has
   become so much greater in comparison to the weakened human race.  She
   attacks humanity in the world of plants with poison and thorn, in the
   animal kingdom with claw and fang, in the skies with lightning and
   gale, in the depths with fiery volcano and quake.  She sets herself up
   as a possessed and angry colossus that leaps upon the human community
   with unrivaled destructive power.  In this state of anger, her strength
   has been multiplied tenfold.  She roars and snarls to terrify the
   people.  Subdued by this violent anger, a terrorized race withdraws
   into itself as a snail hides in its shell and sneaks away, trembling
   with fear. [6]

               Fear has become the essence of religion.  Actually, the
   term fear gets in our way when we want to express our tender and inner
   feeling of love for our God.  The Christian religion fills us with a
   Spirit that creates within us an emotion leading us to whisper in holy
   adoration, "Abba, Father!" (Mark 14:36; Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6).  But if
   you turn to the Old Testament, whether you read the stories of Moses or
   about the Patriarchs, the Psalms or the prophets, it is always the fear
   of God that comes to the foreground.  This fear is and will remain the
   dominant form in which godliness expresses itself.  Even in the last
   book of the prophets, Malachi, the Lord asks, "And if I am a master,
   where is my fear?" (Mal. 1:6). [7]

               It could not be otherwise.  It is difficult for us, living
   as we do in a modern world, to imagine concretely the fear and despair
   which our ancestors experienced because of the curse that brutalized
   nature after the fall. [8]   Their relationship to nature went far
   beyond mere dependence.  That word is much too weak to convey the fear
   and terror with which that generation regarded nature with its
   unlimited powers that would brook no restraints and of which they
   became helpless prey.  The human spirit was beset by apprehension, by
   anxiety and by terror unto death--by fear in the fullest sense of the
   word.  Anyone so beset by terror and carnality and who had ceased
   worshipping God could hardly avoid regarding this all-powerful force of
   nature as the ultimate or highest power.

               Nature worship and its close relative, subjection to evil
   spirits which were thought to be the basic cause behind the terrorism
   nature represented, arose out of this fear.  Those who continued to
   believe that God retains power over nature and that the latter is His
   servant came to regard God with a similar kind of fear, so that fear of
   God became a central focus of their religion.

               It is in this context that the need for miracles arose.
   The need arose because of the contrast between a weakened human race
   and a brutalized nature that had acquired such great and destructive
   powers.  Humanity had become so impressed with and fearful of nature,
   that God was obscured and no longer noticed.  He was invisible, while
   nature with its terrorizing powers was around them at all times and had
   to be taken into account constantly.  The impression nature made upon
   the human race was so overwhelming that it destroyed human courage.
   Who could withstand nature?  Who could oppose her?  Who could overcome
   and subdue her?

               Well, yet, it is true: faith in God had not disappeared
   altogether.  It was dimly realized that the Creator of heaven and earth
   had to be more powerful.  Sometimes His help was recognized, coming as
   it usually did via ordinary means.  But the question could not be
   suppressed: is God, our God, really stronger than nature?  Is He really
   its Lord and master?  People would plead and pray, torture themselves
   and make offerings to God, but after all that, nature would gain the
   victory.  Such situations further depressed faith in God.  The final
   conclusion for most was that nature was the all-powerful one, not God.
   Fear for nature with its accompanying doubt as to God's power had
   eventually to lead to the question whether God even exists.  It was in
   order to take the wind out of the fearful faith-undermining experience
   that miracles became necessary.  Whenever God would show His signs and
   miracles that so brilliantly displayed His power over nature, then fear
   for nature would go on the retreat and God becomes once again a refuge
   and rock for His children.

               Revelation also became necessary in this context.  In
   addition to God's apparent powerlessness, He was invisible.  Where was
   He?  How could He be discovered?  That is where revelation came in,
   already beginning in the Garden of Eden.  He made promises and these
   were fulfilled.  He announced judgement in the great flood and it
   came.  He related to the Patriarchs as a man to his friend.  Hence, in
   the community where this revelation was given, faith in God's existence
   was either retained or revived.  But this was a small community.  Those
   who were blessed with this revelation were very few.

               Among the other nations, faith in God faded away.  Almost
   all of them succumbed either to nature worship or they subjected
   themselves to evil spirits.  The time arrived when a new people had to
   be called and formed, a people among whom faith in God formed the
   foundation of their nation.  To this end, the descendants of the
   Patriarchs had to go through the melting pot of Egypt.  From there they
   emerged as one nation, called to leave Egypt and to take possession of
   Canaan and so to become the people of the Lord.  It was at this point
   that God worked a miracle so grandiose and so overwhelming that it
   became for Israel the miracle that would remain for them the foundation
   of faith and hope throughout the ages.

               The first miracles occurred in the presence of Pharaoh in
   his palace.  Then came the miracles of judgement upon Pharaoh and his
   people.  Finally, we witness the mighty miracle of Israel's crossing of
   the Red Sea.  The obvious intention here was a display of power in
   order to inculcate respect for God on the part of Egypt and its
   rulers.  Other reasons for this display included the liberation of
   Israel and their establishment as a household of faith in the God of
   their fathers.

               These miracles were preceded by revelation to Moses.  God
   judged it necessary to make a deep and powerful impression on Moses of
   God's holy existence.  And then came the competition with the wise men
   of Egypt.

               Take careful note of the following!  How could these
   Egyptian wise men perform the miracles they did?  The ancients had
   retained an instinctive knowledge or understanding of nature, handed
   over as tradition from generation to generation.  This tradition
   included certain secrets that left the human race at the time with a
   remnant of control over nature.  Superficial mockery may try to explain
   this all away as imagination and deceit, but it is not so treated in
   Scripture.  We are told that the wise men of Egypt could indeed perform
   works that are beyond most of us today and that can be explained only
   in reference to a certain mysterious, instinctive knowledge of power
   over nature that has since then been lost.

               Though we gladly acknowledge the existence of such
   knowledge at the time, it must simultaneously be conceded that it was
   mixed with a great deal of deceit and trickery.  The source of the wise
   men's magic was that traditional knowledge of nature.  This secret
   knowledge had served for a long time to elevate the people of Egypt to
   a higher level of culture, but by this time it had deteriorated into
   deceitful magic.  For this reason, Moses and Aaron stood up to them
   with a completely different power, the wonderful power of God.  They
   did so in ways that are unfamiliar to the modern person, but that
   effectively demonstrated the emptiness of these Egyptian mysteries.
   The first cycle of miracles is thus aimed at counteracting the
   mysteries that still bloomed in Egypt.

               Things became more serious upon completion of this cycle.
   Now came the miracles of judgement.  These were mostly miracles for
   which the powers of nature were harnessed in order to fulfil the
   judgement of God on the pride of Pharaoh.  The Egyptians were very
   proud of their river Nile and they worshipped it as an idol.  And now
   God turned that same Nile, that idol, into His instrument for
   destroying Egypt's pride.

               Then came the miraculous plagues from the desert.  These
   can only be explained in terms of an intensified working of nature, but
   so intensified that even the Egyptians had to acknowledge the working
   of a higher power, even though they continually retreated into their
   unbelief.

               But then all the stops were pulled out.  The first-born
   sons of Egypt died.  Israel marched through the Red Sea.  Now the
   people saw the full power of God and all His glory over nature at
   work.  Miriam and all the women with her burst out into jubilation at
   such a display of wonderful power.  And Moses shouted it out, "Who
   among the gods is like you, O Lord?  Who is like you - majestic in
   holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?" (Exodus 15:11).

               The last miracle is the miracle at the beginning of
   Israel's history that has forever been established as the witness to
   Jehovah's unrivalled superiority over nature and its powers and thus
   has become the cornerstone of Israel's religion.  Israel will from here
   on time and again refer to this magnificent display of power.  This
   event continued to provide them with a focus for all of their
   subsequent history and with a source of strength.  "Jehovah, a God who
   works wonders," is the call that accompanied them during their entry
   into Canaan.  All the inhabitants of Canaan were terrified at the God
   of Israel.  This reputation of a God more powerful than nature filled
   the nations with awesome fear and its experience filled the children of
   Israel with courage that enabled them to subdue Canaan.

               In this way, faith in the living God was preserved for the
   benefit of the human race through the miraculous.  The miraculous is
   not a mere appendage to the history of religion.  It does not serve as
   mere decoration on a cake, something you could simply ignore.  To the
   contrary, the miraculous had a most significant role to play.  Out of
   it came revival and the reaffirmation of faith.  Even the fact that we
   can believe in a living God today is, after so many centuries, still to
   be attributed to that miracle that took place at the beginning of
   Israel's history.

               The full significance of the miraculous cannot be
   appreciated, unless you go back to the ordinance of God that the human
   race is to subdue all of nature and all of the earth (Gen 1:26-28). [9]
     Sin has robbed the human race of the crown of honour.  After the
   fall, humanity was faced with unrestrained violence on the part of
   nature, helpless and impotent.  Mankind was left with the question
   whether the God it adored was also impotent in the face of this
   turbulent creation.  Or was this God in a position to lord it over
   nature and to protect its human victims from its violence?

               The answer to this question could be given only by
   miracles.  It had to become known that there is a power much greater
   than that of nature, one that can work or reveal itself in nature,
   control her and make her subservient to a higher goal.  Spiritual or
   oral revelation would not be able to make the point sufficiently.
   There was need for a demonstration of power over the terrible terrors
   of nature to which an impotent race found itself subjected in fear.  It
   is precisely this need that was supplied by the miracles at the birth
   of the people of Israel.  That is the reason the Reformed churches, in
   distinction from some other traditions, did not ignore the Old
   Testament in order to bury themselves only in the New.  The Reformed
   fathers constantly referred back to the beginning of Israel for the
   purpose of honouring the mighty revelation of the miraculous power of
   God in that birth.  They understood that this miracle, for which there
   was no need in the Garden of Eden, had to come after the paradise
   tradition had worn off.  A new faith had to be nurtured in Israel, so
   that eventually all nations of the earth would be blessed through that
   people.

Chapter 2

                             THE MIRACLES OF CHRIST

               The foregoing discussion by no means exhausts the
   significance of miracles in the Bible.  Until now, we have discussed
   primarily those miracles that God directly and immediately performed
   Himself.  Their purpose was to demonstrate that God's power far exceeds
   that of nature, though her power, too, is impressive.  Those who
   thought nature to be a superior power would backslide into the idolatry
   of nature worship.  Only those who recognized and confessed that the
   power of Jehovah far exceeded that of nature, would bow themselves in
   humility and adoration before the Invisible One.  Fear filled the
   hearts of everyone, fear that expressed itself either in terror before
   nature or in the worship of the God of miracles.

               More needs to be said.  If we stop here, we will not see
   the relationship between the task of the human race to rule and develop
   the world (Gen. 1:26-28), the Cultural Mandate, and to the power to
   perform miracles of which the Scripture speaks.  If we are to obtain a
   clear and complete understanding of the miraculous, we need to pay
   attention to two other series of miracles, namely, those performed by
   the men of God and, secondly, the wonders and signs of Christ Himself.

               As far as the miracles performed by the men of God are
   concerned, we will discuss only those that these men themselves have
   performed by means of a power granted them.  We will ignore the signs
   of competition with the wise men of Egypt as well as those wonders by
   which these men of God played only an external role.

               When Moses stretched his staff over the River Nile or over
   the Red Sea, it was not as if Moses brought these miracles about on his
   own power by simply swinging his staff.  Moses himself rejected any
   such interpre-tation.  He gave the glory to God alone when he sang, "By
   the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up..." (Exodus 15:8).  When
   he hit the rock with his staff, instead of speaking to it, his
   self-esteem prompted him to take the initiative with respect to this
   miracle, even though he was not the source of the power to accomplish
   it.

   It is not always easy to distinguish clearly between miracles performed
   directly by God Himself and others in which God is involved, but in
   which people serve as tools or channels through which the power of God
   comes to expression.  Nevertheless, there is a difference between
   them.  The flood was a direct miracle in which no human being
   participated.  The raising of the child of the widow by the prophet
   Elisha, however, involved the medium of the prophet.  The virgin birth
   of Christ was an immediate miracle of God, while the signs and wonders
   performed by the disciples were possible because Jesus empowered them.

               There is a direct relationship between the miracles
   performed through the media of the men of God and the royal mandate to
   the human race to rule the world.  The power to perform these miracles
   has been given to us in order to gain the victory over nature and to
   undo the effects of the curse.

               We are faced here with a mystery, namely the power of the
   spiritual over the material.  There is no better example of this power
   than that which we exercise over our own bodies.  In all that we do
   through and with our bodies, it is not the body that does it, but the
   spirit within us. [10] It is our spirit that moves our bodies around
   and makes it perform.  When one person holds the hand of another or
   embraces another with his arm, the hand and arm are merely in the
   service of the spirit in us that makes our bodily parts perform.  In
   all that we do, our bodies are the servants of our spirits.

               As much power as the spirit has over our body, it does not
   have the power to influence the world outside our bodies in an
   immediate way, that is, without some external means.  The ability to
   exercise such external immediate influence is restricted for most of us
   to our speech.  We are no longer capable of exercising immediate
   influence on the material world around us.  The means through which
   such influence could have been exercised has been broken.  We now stand
   almost helpless before nature.             The Bible testifies often
   that the supernatural world of spirits can exert influence on our
   world, good influence from God's angels and evil influence from
   demons.  Fallen man is as powerless with respect to demonic influence
   as he is over against nature.  He is not capable of delivering a man
   possessed by demons. However, it is clear from the residual
   after-effects of the instinctive power over nature found in animistic
   societies, that such instinctive power belonged originally to the
   entire human race.  Anyone who denies these instinctive residual
   after-effects will have a hard time explaining all the reports coming
   from animistic societies. [11]

               This instinctive after-effect of humanity's original
   ability has gradually faded away until our race became almost totally
   powerless.  Our spirits were restricted to influencing our bodies as
   well as other spirits by means of the word and personal influence.  The
   one appointed by his Creator to rule the world had collapsed into
   impotence.  Although he retained his authority to rule, his scepter and
   crown had fallen away.

               In this context, the miracles that God enabled a few people
   to perform have a unique meaning.  True, they served to rescue or
   liberate people from the miserable predicaments in which they found
   themselves, but their actual purpose lay elsewhere.  Misery was rampant
   in Israel, while it was even more intensive among the other nations.
   If the purpose of these miracles was to rescue people from their
   miseries, the power to perform them should have been much more
   widespread than in fact it was.  They were small in number.  They took
   place within a small area and among only one nation.  They occurred
   only sporadically.  They were performed by only a few individuals, all
   of whom stood in the higher service of interpreting God's revelation.
   The purpose of these miracles was to buttress faith in his revelation,
   to place the seal of truth on this revelation and to evoke the
   conviction that a greater power had come down among the people.  This
   purpose could have been achieved if all these miracles had been
   performed directly by God and without intermediaries, but that was not
   what happened.  In addition to those performed by God directly, others
   were carried out by the mediation of these men of God.  The reason for
   God's using their mediation was to restore mankind in its royal power
   over nature and over evil spirits in a prophetic way.  These miracles
   were a prelude to the triumph, a foreshadowing that in the future,
   humanity would regain what it lost.  They showed a glimmer of the power
   and majesty that had been man's at his creation. They demonstrated that
   the human spirit is capable of greater power when that spirit is
   touched by the Spirit of God.

               These miracles were not produced by magic.  The Scripture
   sharply condemns miracles by magic.  All magic and trickery was banned
   from Israel.  The demonic element that had become mixed up with these
   miracles was strongly opposed in every way. Over against this
   semi-demonic power of magical miracles, arose in Israel the ability to
   perform miracles by means of empowerment of the human spirit by the
   Spirit of God.  This was no magical power; it was a continuation or
   renewal of the original power of the human race over nature.  These
   miracles were momentary flashes seen in a few godly people that showed
   and reminded Israel of the original nobility that was mankind's.  They
   also were prophetic of the glory that lay ahead.  They constituted a
   breakthrough of the curse that had since the fall oppressed the human
   race and continues to do so partially, but that will one day be lifted.

               The story of Daniel in the lion's den reminds us of Adam in
   the Garden of Eden.  Of course, it was God's power that restrained
   these animals, but that power is the secret in all that we do, not only
   in our miracles.  When one is victorious in battle, he may return home
   a hero, but he will give God the glory, for God's power was operative
   through the victor.  The miraculous power that suddenly came to life in
   Daniel was the same power of which we see a glimmer in a tamer of wild
   animals and which Adam possessed fully in the Garden of Eden.  Daniel
   stood among the kings of the forest as the human king over nature.

               The above power is displayed in its full majesty by the son
   of Man, our Saviour.  The Old Testament miracles have to be seen in
   relationship to the Messiah.  They were distant prophecies of what
   would be accomplished by Christ.  They were reminders of the high
   position of the human race before the fall.  They demonstrated that
   restoration of those original powers was possible and prophesied, that,
   indeed, they would be restored.  However, these miracles could not
   reveal that power in its fullness.  That revelation would first come
   with Christ, in whom we meet mankind without sin, that is, mankind with
   its original unbroken power.

               It is important in this context that we do not turn the
   miracles of the Son of Man into miracles of the Son of God.  It would
   be easy to do so.  God is almighty.  It is easy to attribute Christ's
   signs and miracles to His divine powers and to regard these miracles as
   proof of His divinity.  Their purpose was to show that the Father had
   sent Him, that He had a task to perform on earth.  He never made a
   sharp distinction between His own miracles and those of His disciples.
   He made the remarkable promise to the disciples that whoever believed
   in Him would do even greater works that His (John 14:12).  With respect
   to forgiveness of sins, the Lord said, "But so that you may know that
   the Son of Man (not: "Son of God") has authority on earth to forgive
   sins...  Then He said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go
   home" (Mat. 9:6).  Matthew adds that the crowd was amazed that such
   authority was given to people.  You will completely misunderstand
   Jesus' work, unless you realize that He was among us as the Son of
   Man.  He humbled Himself, in fact, destroyed Himself, when He took upon
   Himself the form of a servant.  While on earth, He neither ruled as the
   Son of God nor did He display the majesty of His divinity, but He
   appeared among us as a human being, as one of us, and He did not reveal
   any power other than that potentially available to all humanity.  He
   simply obeyed His Father.  He came to fulfill the work to which His
   Father had called Him.

               All his powers resided in His spirit.  The Holy Spirit was
   given to Him in rich measure.  It was a spiritual power that worked in
   Him always within the parameters of our human nature, subject to the
   ordinances that God Himself had embedded in the creation of our human
   nature.  When Jesus was arrested, He said to Peter, "Do you think I
   cannot call on my Father, and He will at once put at my disposal more
   than twelve legions of angels?" (Mat. 26:53). He was not speaking as
   the Son of God.  God does not need the help of angels.  He spoke as the
   Son of Man, who would be rescued from danger and death by an invincible
   army of angels.

               Jesus represents for us the restored person in whom the
   human spirit had reached the pinnacle of power over against nature,
   material and the demons.  It would be wrong to assert that Jesus was
   like Adam, for in Adam human development was in its beginning phase,
   while in Jesus this development reached its climax.  He was not merely
   a person, but He was the Son of Man, the central person.  He
   represented the human race in its fulfillment, humanity in its richest
   and highest power and authority.  Adam's power over the creation
   collapsed the moment the curse fell upon creation and made it go
   berserk.  The Son of Man, however, possessed the power of the human
   spirit to the highest possible degree so that He could even control
   nature, disoriented as it was by the curse.  Similarly, His power to
   perform miracles remained to the end a human power, that is, a power
   that falls within the limits of our human nature.  Human nature here
   is, of course, to be understood not as we know it today, but as it was
   in Adam, except that it had reached mature development.  In Jesus'
   signs and miracles there resided a power that far exceeds our power,
   but it was a power that He received, that was given to Him.  It was not
   something He possessed in Himself as Son of God.  In His signs and
   wonders He revealed Himself not in His divinity, but in His humanity.
   Even in His present state of glorification He is and remains the
   glorified Head of the church, the glorified Son of Man.  As God, He
   could not have been glorified in the sense of being "promoted."  And as
   to His future glory, the apostle teaches that His saved ones will one
   day reign together with Him as King.  Also, our humiliated bodies will
   one day become glorified like His.

               It is not possible here to treat exhaustively the
   relationship between Christ's divine and human nature, but it must be
   emphasized that the signs and miracles of our Lord must not be regarded
   as direct divine miracles.  The work of Christ in its totality was one
   grand miraculous display of power of the man Jesus Christ or, better
   still, of the Son of Man.  He was robed with the majesty of Adam before
   the fall, except that in Christ this majesty had reached its full
   development, culmination.  Furthermore, Christ applied His power to a
   nature deeply disturbed by the curse and become violent.  Thus He stood
   in all His human majesty and power over against the worlds of demons
   and of nature.  The power and authority that humanity lost in the
   Garden were restored in Him and then developed to their culmination.
   In His miraculous power we see the reappearance of the glory of human
   control over the earth.

               When Jesus was tempted in the desert, "He was with the wild
   animals, and angels attended Him" (Mark 1:13).  This scene reminds us
   of the story in the Garden when Adam gave names to the animals.  His
   temptation in the wilderness reminds us of the temptation of Adam and
   Eve, the difference being that while Adam and Eve gave in, the Son of
   Man was victorious.  His battle was first of all against demons.
   Casting out devils breaks the demonic power.  When Jesus sent out His
   disciples, their main assignment was "to drive out evil spirits" (Mat.
   10:1).  It is this demonic power that undergirds so much of nature.
   This demonic power displayed itself especially in those considered
   possessed.  Jesus broke that power with a power that is within reach of
   humanity, for both the disciples and the apostles also drove out
   demons.

               The power of the Son of Man showed itself in ever widening
   spheres.  Not only were the animals in the desert subjected to Him, but
   so were the fish of the sea.  He also demonstrated power over the world
   of plants by turning water into wine (John 2) as well as by multiplying
   loaves of bread (Mat. 14, 16) and by causing a fig tree to wither (Mat.
   21).   He displayed His power over the inanimate world when He walked
   on the water (Mat. 14) and stilled the storm (Mark 4).  This display of
   power was not limited to the realm of nature.  He also attacked the
   result of the curse.  He freed the blind, deaf and dumb from their
   shackles.  Victims of every kind of disease received mercy and healing
   at His hands.  Finally, at least three times He re-united body and soul
   of those who died.  Not only did He heal the diseased, but He also
   healed the wounded, as in the case of the servant of the High Priest
   (Luke 22).

               All of Jesus' miracles are cut from the same cloth and form
   a unit.  It could almost be said that there was a plan in the way the
   Messiah restored and fully developed the power of the human spirit,
   thus demonstrating clearly His triumph over the various realms of the
   demonic, of nature and of suffering in general.  You can appreciate
   this display of power fully only if you recognize in all of it the Son
   of Man as victorious King over all that opposes or attacks mankind.

               The above does not deny the legitimacy of looking at each
   miracle individually and attribute individual meaning to each one.  You
   may also admire Jesus' pity for the maimed or His love for the
   suffering.  Jesus' miracles form a holy string of pearls, in which each
   pearl by itself is of great value.  Nevertheless, it is only when you
   regard the pearl string as a single entity that you can understand the
   basic meaning of Jesus' miracles and thoroughly analyze their deeper
   significance.  Such analysis and understanding require that you do not
   take the godless race or the sinner as your point of reference, but
   mankind as God created it in His image, crowned with honour, clothed
   with power and majesty, anointed as king over creation.

               That race had gone under, disappeared, no longer to be
   found.  However, the germ of that power and glory was still present in
   human nature, though smothered under the ruins of sin and curse.  It
   was that original human nature that Jesus adopted.  He was the seed
   promised to Eve.  As far as the flesh is concerned, He was from Adam's
   loins.  His Spirit was allotted a level of power that restored in Him
   all the glory of the Garden.  In Him that glory shone once again, but
   now in its complete potential brilliance.  In the presence of that
   brilliance all the agitation and turbulence caused by sin and curse
   became pale, even as far as the triumph over death.  Thus the kingship
   of Christ in its first manifestation was not a foreign robe hung on His
   shoulders.  Neither was it a foreign authority laid upon Him.  This
   kingship, this power, this authority emerged from human nature,
   spiritually elevated to a very high and rich state.  It was the
   man-King from the Garden that was revived in Jesus and developed far
   beyond its initial form.

   [10] Not being a psychologist, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the
   details of the theory here advanced.  However, the general picture
   advocated would seem to be confirmed by the Biblical emphasis on the
   role of the spiritual in human action.

   [11] Only yesterday a Nigerian Muslim theologian recently converted to
   Christ told me that he used to have the power to make people berserk by
   placing a curse on them.  After his conversion, he undid the curse, the
   victims became free and he apologized to them for his actions.  These
   curses can affect people without anyone knowing the perpetrator.  Only
   the day before yesterday, I received a letter from a Nigerian pastor
   who from his childhood on was dedicated by his parents to the service
   of Satan.  He had the power to curse and otherwise ruin the lives of
   anyone he desired.  Upon his conversion, he also renounced these
   powers.  He is now engaged in a Christian healing ministry.  People
   with such demonic powers are found throughout Africa, among adherents
   of Traditional Religion as well as Islam.

Chapter 3

                           HUMAN POWER AND AUTHORITY

               Thus, in summary, the immediate, direct divine miracles
   have restored faith in the majesty of God's omnipotence, in His power
   and authority over a nature that had gone berserk under the curse.
   Likewise, in Christ's miracles human rule over nature was restored.  It
   is important that we distinguish sharply between these two series of
   miracles.  In God's direct, immediate miracles we see the revelation of
   the majesty of the Lord of Lords, but when Jesus restrains the angry
   waves of the Sea of Galilee, we witness the Son of Man subduing nature
   to His will as the King of nature.

               Then there is the unique significance of the miracle of
   Jesus' giving His disciples the ability to do likewise and even more,
   as in His promise to them that they would do even greater things that
   He did (John 14:12).  The first time we hear about this is when Jesus
   sent His disciples out in order to announce to the children of Israel
   the coming of His kingdom.  Matthew tells us that Jesus "gave them
   authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and
   sickness" (Mat. 10:1).  The disciples crisscrossed the country and
   returned to Jesus in holy ecstasy, rejoicing that the spirits submitted
   to them and that they had been able to perform miracles (Luke 10:17).
   It appears that they attached too much significance to this new
   experience, for Jesus had to warn them not to "rejoice that the spirits
   submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven" (Luke
   10:20).  This warning clearly implies that the power they displayed
   during their ministry of healing and miracles belonged to the sphere of
   this earthly life and that they were to pursue the highest state that
   was not to be found in this stage of their earthly life, but in the
   coming state of human glorification.

   We receive further explanation about this miraculous power given to the
   disciples after Jesus' descent from the mountain of transfiguration.
   Only three of His disciples were present at this wonderful event, while
   the others were left at the foot of the mountain.  While Jesus and the
   three were on the mountain, an agonizing father turned to the waiting
   disciples at the foot of the mountain with his epileptic son.  He
   begged them to deliver his son from the demon that possessed him.  The
   disciples tried, but they were not successful.  When Jesus came down
   from the mountain, the man turned to Him for help and told Him the
   disciples could not deliver him.  Jesus rebuked the demon and it left
   the boy.  He reprimanded the disciples with these strange words, "If
   you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this
   mountain, Move from here to there' and it will move" (Mat. 17:20).  In
   the account of Mark, Jesus adds, "This kind can come out only by
   fasting and prayer" (Mark 9:29).

               There are three clear implications in these words of Jesus.
   (1) The power of healing given them was not a magical power, but an
   ability that requires the foundation of faith. (2) This power of faith
   was to serve as an exercise of the power of the spirit over the power
   of the material in its demonic substratum. (3) This ability or gift can
   be developed or improved by means of fasting and prayer.  The gift or
   ability to perform such miracles was not merely an outflow of divine
   power for which this gift served as a mere funnel.  Rather, it was an
   ability or gift that emerged from human nature, though a nature
   sanctified by faith and strengthened by fasting and prayer.

               We ought not to circumvent the strong statement of Jesus
   that the disciples would be able to move mountains if they had faith.
   Usually people explain this statement moralistically by referring to a
   "mountain-moving faith."  What is meant with this explanation is merely
   that faith will ultimately triumph over all difficulties of life, even
   if such difficulties appear to us like high mountains.  This
   explanation does not fit the context.  The story here is about an
   epileptic boy, possessed by demons, that the disciples tried to deliver
   but failed.  Jesus located the reason for their failure in their lack
   of faith.  Over against this lack and subsequent failure, Jesus pointed
   out which faith and what power of faith was required for them to be
   able to heal such people and to perform such miracles.  Jesus'
   reference to moving mountains is not about a faith that can overcome
   moral problems, but about one that is able to heal the diseased.  The
   moralistic interpretation is irrelevant in this context.  The subject
   here is that of power to perform miracles and of unlimited power over
   disease.

               Neither is the explanation acceptable that turns "faith
   like a grain of mustard seed" into an extremely weak faith, one that is
   in its beginning phase.  True, a grain of mustard seed is a very small
   seed, but Jesus' point here is not about a weak, beginning faith.  In
   no way does Jesus deny that the disciples had faith.  Their faith was
   proven by the many miracles and healings they already had performed.
   Jesus rebuked them because their faith was not strong enough.  That is
   to say, it was not strong enough to cope with this special kind of
   demon.  This specific kind was so powerful that it could not be driven
   out by faith except it was accompanied by fasting and prayer.  Thus the
   mustard seed is not regarded here in terms of its small size compared
   to other seeds, but from the point of view of its power, that in such
   an exceedingly small seed there is a power resident that can turn it
   into a tree.  It is also this aspect of the power of this small seed
   that impressed Jesus the most, as in Mat.13:31. There Jesus emphasized
   that though it is the smallest of seeds, it grows into "the largest of
   garden plants" and eventually turns into a tree large enough to house
   birds.  The disciples did have faith, but it lacked power to deal with
   this special kind of demon.  Like the mustard seed, their faith may
   have been small, but out of the small faith a power was to be developed
   so unbelievably strong that it would grow into a tree in which the
   birds would nest.  The emphasis is on the surprising and unexpected
   power of the tiny mustard seed, the same surprising and unexpected
   power to be resident in and to develop out of the small faith of the
   disciples.  They definitely had faith, but the stem did not shoot up
   from the seed of their faith with sufficient power.

               When Jesus applied the same thought to the mountain that
   could be cast into the sea, He was not referring to magical
   experiments, but to the tiny seed of faith that can develop itself into
   a mighty power that can withstand all opposition of flesh, material and
   nature and that can defy the demonic powers hiding behind these.  The
   gift of Jesus to His disciples to perform miracles was the power of the
   spirit that was natural to the human race at creation, that was lost
   through sin, but can be restored through faith.  More even, through
   faith this power can be enhanced to a higher level.  It is also clear
   that Jesus directed this ability of theirs first of all to doing away
   with the effects of the curse.  They would drive out demons and heal
   the sick.  The spiritual character of the power of their faith was
   emphasized to such an extent that Jesus, who in all diseases always
   penetrated to the demonic effects of the curse, ensured that in their
   spiritual power the holy would triumph over the demonic.

               It will be useful for us to pay attention to the comments
   of Jesus in John 14:11-12.  There Jesus pointed to His works and
   invited people to "believe on the evidence of the miracles
   themselves."  He added, "Anyone who has faith in me will do what I have
   been doing.  He will do even greater things than these."  Here, too, it
   is clear that Jesus located His own powers to perform miracles within
   human nature and did not attribute them to His divine nature.  If His
   miracles derived from His divine nature, it would not have been
   possible for the disciples to inherit these same powers, for they
   shared only His human nature.  Jesus did not separate Himself from the
   disciples, but He chose a terrain where He and His disciples had common
   ground, He as the Son of Man and they as the children of men.  In this
   same passage it is also clear that the works the believers were to
   carry out, would include having spiritual power over nature in order to
   free the latter from the curse itself and from the demonic activities
   that are activated by the curse.  This power was to be exercised on
   basis of the power resident in their faith.

               There is still more to it.  Jesus said that the disciples
   would have this power BECAUSE He is going to the Father.  As they
   performed these works and even greater ones, they were doing so in
   relation to Christ.  They were seen in unity with Christ, as being in
   Him, as mystically being present in His body, as working out of Him as
   their Head.  However, this relationship or condition would not be in
   place till after He had died, risen, gone up to heaven and was seated
   at the right hand of God.  That is what He meant, when He said, "I will
   do whatsoever you ask in My Name."  Again, "You may ask Me for anything
   in My Name, and I will do it."  Jesus presented Himself as the source
   of this power that would operate in His believers and that would
   inspire them.  He did not say that God would do it, but He, the Son of
   Man, their Head and Lord, would be active in the members of His
   spiritual Body. Neither was there any reference to a power or gift over
   which they themselves would have independent control.  This was a
   royal-human power that resided in the Son of Man and that would be
   revealed as it radiated from Him to the believers as members of the
   spiritual Body.  This was the royal authority of mankind at work, but
   that, because of the curse upon creation, was lost by the sinful race.
   This authority was revived in Jesus as the Son of Man and radiated from
   Him as Head of the Body, to His believers.

               In all this it becomes convincingly clear how extremely
   superficial the opinion is that Jesus' words were intended solely to
   reveal His divine power.  Such an opinion would not leave room for the
   fact that the disciples also received this power of miracles, even
   though they were ordinary human beings.  This opinion would render it
   totally impossible that the disciples would do even greater works that
   Jesus Himself.  This whole development makes sense only if you regard
   the miracles performed by Jesus as done by the Messiah, that is, as
   done by the One promised by the Father, who came from God and who
   shared in our human nature.  Furthermore, this development can be
   appreciated only if you recognize in this Son of Man the restoration
   and the further elevation of powers that at creation were impressed on
   the human race by God.  Only when seen in this perspective can you
   relate the miracles of Jesus with creation itself, with the fall, with
   the curse and with the penetration of demonic powers into this world.
   In this perspective these miracles form an indispensable link in the
   history of salvation.  Only then can one see the miracles of Jesus in
   the framework of this history.  And only then can they be shown to have
   controlled the further development of human domination over the
   material element of creation, over nature, over the curse and over the
   demonic powers that operate in and through this curse.

               As soon as the apostles became public witnesses to the
   Lord, they showed they had the same kind of miraculous power as Jesus.
   The first specific apostolic miracle about which we read is the healing
   of the cripple (Acts 3).  The apostle Peter showed his strong
   consciousness that the secret of their authority was not in magic, but
   in their communion with Christ their King. "Why do you stare at us as
   if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?" Peter
   asked the crowd.  "By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see
   and know was made strong."  Faith makes possible the restoration of
   spiritual power to human nature.  It is not something independent, but
   is valid only in relationship to the Son of Man.  That faith was
   operative in this event in both Peter and in the lame man.  This faith
   that breaks the power of demons and that reconciles us to God through
   Christ, was given to the apostles and to the lame.  That is why Peter
   added, "It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through Him that has
   given this complete healing to him, as you can all see."  The
   revelation of the apostles' miraculous power made such an impression on
   the people, that they carried all their sick to them wherever the
   apostles went.

               Although Paul was not among the original disciples of
   Jesus, after his conversion it soon became clear that this same power
   was also operative in him.  After all, this power did not depend on the
   physical presence of Jesus, but it was given by Him and could be
   developed to its highest level only after His elevation to the right
   hand of God.  It could radiate from Him fully only as Head of the Body,
   as the King of the new humanity.  In James 5, we read that the elders
   would anoint the sick, pray with them and heal them.  This practise was
   merely the continuation of the practise of Jesus and the apostles.
   This power to heal through prayer is available to us even today; it has
   not been abrogated.

               It is not possible to attribute all these stories of
   miracles and healing to imagination and deceit.  If these healings of
   specific persons in specific places had not really taken place, they
   would have been discredited long ago.  Without having conducted careful
   research, no one has the authority or right to deny the possibility
   that this same miraculous power is still available to us today.  Some
   might reason that, since these miracles are not as common today as they
   were in that distant past, they did not take place then either.
   However, anyone reasoning along that line does not understand the
   unique character of revelation.  Israel became a nation of God's people
   by means of the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea and the provision of
   the law at Mount Horeb.  But this does not mean that all people have to
   have originated in the same way.  In Israel a new faith had to be
   developed.  Other nations have inherited it from them.

               Even in the developments of nature it is recognized that
   there are certain climatic events of special importance.  A tree
   develops from a seed that may go through various stages that never
   re-occur.  The characteristics of a child are very different from those
   of an adult, while the adult displays qualities that would be
   unthinkable in a child.  Similarly, age brings unique qualities to
   people that are not found among those of middle age.  The same holds
   true for all historical developments.  All historical developments go
   through various stages, each with their own peculiarities.  Here, too,
   there is the parallel of the tree that begins as a seed and ends up
   bearing fruit.

               As far as revelation is concerned, in its first period the
   miraculous has a special meaning and function, but it should not be
   concluded that in the next phase of revelation, that is, its dispersion
   among the nations, the same phenomena must repeat themselves in the
   same way.  Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that, according to the
   Scriptures, seducers and tempters and even the Antichrist himself could
   perform miracles.  For this reason, it is necessary that whenever we
   hear reports of miracles, we must pay close attention to the source of
   power that is said to have performed such miracles.

               There is no reason at all to deny the existence of a
   spiritual healing power in our present day, provided we keep in mind
   both the special character of the first historical phase of revelation
   and the danger of demonic miracles.  We may not deny the possibility
   that it could please God to perform miracles today or that a power
   could radiate from faith in Christ to heal the sick.  This statement
   does not mean that we have simply to accept in good faith all the
   stories about miracles and healings that we hear about these days.  The
   facts must be investigated and established objectively.  Gullibility
   has no place in this context.

               There are two questions on which the whole matter depends.
   First, the kind of power that our souls have over our bodies.
   Secondly, the kind of power faith can raise in our souls.  The
   relationship between soul and body is until this day all but clear.  We
   have earlier pointed to the doubling of muscular strength that may take
   place in a mentally disturbed person.  Though it may be hidden to us,
   somewhere within us there is a point where the soul makes contact with
   our nervous system.  Through that contact point the soul exercises
   influence on our muscular system.  It is not our body that sees, hears,
   moves, lifts or drops, but it is the soul that uses the body as its
   medium.  In the sleepwalker it is the soul that guides the body while
   the latter is unconscious of it.  Courage has its seat in the soul and
   it has been shown that courage can perform greater miracles than the
   most muscular giant.  Joshua and the people of Israel had their spirits
   lifted seven times by words, "Be strong and of good courage."  This
   admonition was given on the assumption of the powerful influence of the
   soul on the body.  Who then will deny that under certain circumstances
   the soul has powers to evoke superior strength in the body?  Even
   medical doctors value the role of the patients' morale in the healing
   process more than you may think.  The soul can be subjected to intense
   cultivation so as to exert healing influence on the body.  This
   cultivation can be the result of faith that, in turn, can have a
   special focus on one's own healing.  Faith in the possibility of one's
   own healing can have various sources in the hearts of the sick.  It can
   be inspired by what they hear from or see in others.  It can originate
   in the prayer impulse in one's soul.  Another factor to be considered
   here is the spiritual influence of one soul on another.  It is possible
   to approach the soul of another without having physical contact.
   Napoleon, for example, inspired his armies from long distances by the
   mere sound of his name.  Both biology and hypnotism have demonstrated
   beyond any doubt that one spirit can exert direct influence on another
   spirit.  Faith on the part of the one spirit can directly evoke faith
   on the part of the other.

               We do not intend here to trespass on psychology.  Faith in
   healing always requires faith in Christ as the basis.  This faith that
   turns the soul or converts it comes only from above.  As Peter
   expressed it, this kind of healing comes about only in communion with
   Christ and through His name.  Thus we resist all attempts to declare
   healing by spiritual power as impossible for our day or as based purely
   on deceit.  At the same time, we admit that deceit and fabrication are
   not infrequently used to pretend the possession of healing power.  We
   also realize that there has never been a lack of unique individuals who
   possess great biological strength that they have confused with a
   spiritual consciousness so as to regard themselves as miracle workers
   and abuse the gullibility of the people for their own glory and to
   their advantage.

               However, as we shall soon see, it is not to such spiritual
   healing that we must look for the further development of Christ's rule
   over the powers of nature.  For that development we must look
   elsewhere.

Chapter 4

                       THE ENHANCEMENT OF OUR HUMAN POWER

               In summary, we have so far proposed two points.  First,
   miracles had a special significance in the days of Jesus and the
   apostles that fell away once Revelation had been completed.  Secondly,
   it cannot be concluded from the first point that there is no further
   possibility of miracles.  Christ our King lives at the right hand of
   God as Head of the congregation and as Head of humanity.  There is
   power radiating from Him and there is no good reason to think that that
   power can no longer triumph over nature.  We insist on the continued
   possibility of miracles.

               At the same time, we have to agree that neither the
   miracles performed by the apostles nor those of later times were
   greater than those performed by Jesus Himself.  We have only to think
   about the miracle at Cana, about the feeding of the multitude, about
   walking on the sea or stilling the storm, or about the three raised
   from the dead to sense that the glory of the apostolic miracles in no
   way surpassed those of Christ. We do not mean to belittle the apostolic
   miracles or to demean their significance, but we do deny that the
   miracles of the apostles outranked those of Christ.  Nevertheless,
   Christ has emphatically declared that His church would perform more and
   greater things than He Himself has done.  The difficult question then
   arises as to where we are to look for this "greater" and of what it
   consists.

               We are not satisfied with what certain commentators offer
   in this respect.  They point to four things.  They say that the
   apostles shared the Holy Spirit with others through the laying on of
   hands.  Further, they point to their speaking in unusual languages, to
   the spreading of the Gospel throughout the Roman empire and, finally,
   to what is recorded in Mark 16:17-18, where we read, "And these signs
   will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out
   demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with
   their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them
   at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get
   well." [12] It is obvious that not every believer would be able to
   perform such miracles.  It can only mean that throughout the ages such
   things will occur.

               Still we are not convinced that in those works of the
   apostles there was something "greater" than we find in the works of
   Christ.  This assertion is especially true for their spiritual works.
   True, the preaching of Jesus was restricted to Palestine, while Paul
   preached in Spain and Peter in Babylonia, but this difference does not
   qualify the work of the apostles as "greater."  It is no more than an
   extension and continuation of what Jesus started.  They were no more
   than imitators.  Those who are today bringing the gospel to the
   farthest corners of the earth still do not perform works greater than
   those of Christ.  Similarly, the laying on of hands by the apostles
   cannot be described as greater than when Christ breathed on his
   disciples, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit."  Even the speaking in
   unusual languages is not a miracle performed by the apostles.  Rather,
   it was an expression of their souls that occurred without any intention
   on their part.  It was more in the nature of a momentary ecstasy.
   Besides, who would argue that speaking in other languages is superior
   to the stilling of the storm or the feeding of the five thousand?  And
   when you take the acts of the apostles referred to in the passage
   quoted above, one can hardly regard these as greater than those
   performed by Christ.  Besides, till today people in various cultures,
   whether Africa or India, conjure and control snakes.  He who refuses to
   be diverted by superficial arguments will realize that these
   commentators fail to do justice to the promise of Jesus.

               Allow me to recommend a totally different point of view.
   The opinion we are about to advance is based on the difference or
   contrast between two approaches or attitudes to nature.  The one can be
   described as a general lack of awareness that leads to instinctive
   action.  We could call that an attitude of "instinctive
   unconsciousness."  The other attitude is developed by a conscious
   studious manipulation of nature.  We will refer to it as the "conscious
   analytical" or some variation of that. [13]

               Let us illustrate this contrast by a reference to cooking.
   The average housewife in any culture is a good cook who knows exactly
   what spices to put in a dish and how much.  If you were to ask how much
   spice to put in or why, she would not be able to answer, for her
   knowledge is instinctive.  She has never consciously analyzed her
   recipes.  She just knows.  Now you take that same cook and put her
   through a home economics course where everything is analyzed and
   explained.  Her attitude will change from a natural, instinctive
   unconscious application of skills learned in someone's kitchen to a
   kind of conscious, studious, academic approach.  What used to be done
   well unconsciously is now done consciously, aware of all the whys and
   wherefores, of the exact measure of each ingredient, a teaspoon of this
   or a cup of that.  In some countries, such a cook may not have taken a
   course, but she has at her disposal a library of cookbooks that have
   the same effect.

               A further illustration comes from "farming," an occupation
   associated with the world of instinctive unconsciousness, or
   "agriculture," a term more related to the studious, conscious approach
   to that endeavour.  In Isaiah 28:24-29, we have the picture of a
   traditional farmer who knows his trade very well.  From where does he
   get his skill and knowledge?  The prophet explains that "his God
   instructs him and teaches him the right way."  "All this comes from the
   Lord Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom."  Here
   is a description of farming as conducted by unschooled people who go
   about their business in an instinctive way.  They have a talent, a
   gift, a practical, instinctive but unconscious way of doing things that
   God Himself has taught them through the generations.  Such farmers may
   never have heard about agricultural schools, extension services,
   intensive agriculture or any other modern agricultural phenomena.
   However, once people begin to avail themselves of modern developments
   in agriculture, they change over from an instinctive, unconscious
   approach to a more conscious, studious method, which enables one to
   explain and give adequate reasons for the methods used.  As
   modernization progresses in this area, the modern farmer will become
   more conscious about the chemical composition of the soil, the
   requirements of the various seeds and all the factors that influence
   the growing process.  The motivating factor will no longer be that the
   forefathers have handed down this or that method.

               In some cultures this change from the unconscious to the
   conscious approach has gone further than in others.  And as we
   illustrated it by reference to cooking and farming, two basic human
   activities, so it either is developing or has developed in all aspects
   of culture.  Traditionally, parents raised their children without any
   knowledge of pedagogy--and they often did a good job.  But today one
   will find mothers, especially in the Western world, reach for various
   books about raising children.  Traditionally, people would learn
   various trades and establish all kinds of industries, usually small,
   without conscious analysis or feasibility studies.  There were no trade
   schools or technical colleges.  Today such knowledge is despised and
   not recognized.  Everything must be learned and consciously analyzed in
   a recognized institution.  Traditionally, all improvements in whatever
   area were expressions of life itself, of the instinctive urges that
   motivated people, but that instinct is now in danger of being stunted,
   dulled, discouraged.  It is being or has been replaced by the
   conscious, analytical studious approach.

               Another example is that of the field of art.  Artists of
   all kinds have presented their artistic products, all of them motivated
   by this same instinctive unconscious urge.  Often they produced art at
   such a high level that they are admired for generations and even
   centuries.  All modern societies look back upon the artistic heritage
   of their unconscious stage with admiration, as glorious artifacts of
   their past.  All peoples tend to admire the paintings, music and other
   forms of art of what they consider their classical heritage of past
   centuries, the products of their instinctive unconscious phase.  The
   artists of the past seldom, if ever, read any books on art or attended
   art schools.  They all worked instinctively, by inspiration.

               Today, the modern artist must increasingly avail herself of
   the new institutions of art colleges or academies, of literature that
   discusses true and false art, of conferences and workshops where new
   methods may be developed.  Art criticism has become a field for
   professional engagement.  Libraries have large sections of literature
   on aesthetics.

               There is thus an evolution taking place in all cultures,
   advanced more in some than in others, from the instinctive to the
   conscious approach.  Now that these instinctive factors are gradually
   receding and even disappearing, we find ourselves motivated by a
   conscious penetration into the laws of nature to achieve a higher, more
   communal and much more powerful mastery over nature and even over life
   itself.  This more conscious approach of today misses some of the charm
   that was associated with the earlier attitude, but it puts us on a
   higher level, multiplies our powers and equips us as rational beings
   for greater achievements.  Under the former approach, each triumph over
   nature was an independent achievement with hardly any relationship to
   other discoveries or inventions.  Today, our power over nature has
   become communal property; everyone share in it.  In distinction to the
   former piecemeal approach to nature, we now confront nature as a whole
   with our communal power.  Together, we have penetrated the mysteries of
   nature.  We have discovered its composition and the laws that govern
   her movements.  In this shift from the instinctive unconscious to the
   conscious, analytical approach to nature we face an evolutionary
   development of extraordinary proportions, for it places the human race
   over against nature with a much higher measure of power and control.

               Our human civilization started with the instinctive
   unconscious approach rather than the conscious analytical.  The
   instinctive stage is the one during which God Himself, directly,
   without any mediation, shows humanity the way and helps it develop this
   inner power.  It is exactly as the prophet Isaiah put it in the earlier
   quotation.  It was impossible for civilization to start with the
   conscious analytical, for the conscious knowledge of nature had not yet
   developed.  If cultural development had to wait for the analytical
   approach, no progress would ever have been made, for no one possessed
   the wherewithal to analyze nature.  Thus it was wonderful grace that
   God enabled the human race to achieve such great heights through this
   instinctive approach during the first period.  The original mastery
   over nature that was part of mankind's created inheritance broke down
   under sin and the curse, but it did not disappear completely
   immediately after the fall.  It continued to operate among the nations
   in slackening measure, slowly fading away.  Its after-effects, however,
   soon degenerated into magic and eventually shriveled away.
   Nevertheless, the inspiration of the instinctive life continued through
   the ages to carry cultural development along.  It was able to carry
   civilization to a high level. [14] Archeology has surprised us with its
   discoveries of high civilizations like those of Egypt and Canaan in the
   days of Abraham.

               Of course, it cannot be denied that even in those eras of
   long ago the analytical was not lacking altogether.  Imitation has
   always been part of human life and imitation involves study.  Without
   denying that factor, we insist that the peculiar character of cultural
   development was basically that of inherent talent, of instinctive
   motivation, while whatever analysis was done was practiced in a
   superficial way and remained peripheral.

               This stage could not last indefinitely.  Once our race
   began to research into the deep recesses of nature and discovered the
   hidden powers within it to make them subservient to culture, we
   achieved a much greater power over nature.  It will not serve us well
   to lament over the romance and poetry of the past that was lost in the
   process and replaced by cold, prosaic analysis.  This prosaic evolution
   was inevitable and could not be postponed indefinitely.  Given our
   created urge to exercise dominion, humanity had eventually to penetrate
   into the depth of nature to find its hidden powers and thus to
   re-establish dominion.

               And so it happened.  First there was the period of the
   after-effects of our original powers from the Garden of Eden.  This
   period was followed by the flowering of our instinctive life.  Today we
   find ourselves in the third period in which our mastery over nature
   increases rapidly through systematic analysis.  This difference can be
   illustrated in the difference between the way in which traditional
   societies seek to heal the sick with amulets and incantations on the
   one hand and the diagnosis and treatment of the sick by the modern
   medic on the other hand, who has analysed the human body from within
   and is able to discover the basic cause of the disease.  This is not to
   deny that traditional medicine men do heal people.  It can even be
   acknowledged that there were certain effective diagnoses and
   medications in the past that are now ignored to our own hurt.  Modern
   medical technology continues to be plagued by the way it has contempt
   for much healing in the past.  But surely we all realize that the
   understanding of disease, the level of knowledge and of medical
   technology has reached a much higher plateau.  We also realize that in
   this period of conscious research we have taken a much stronger
   position vis a vis diseases than was the case in the era of tradition
   and instinct.  Thus, we ought not to look back to the era with
   nostalgia, even though we should recognize its relative successes.  Our
   rational power resides in the conscious life, not in the instinctive
   approach.  Only when we approach nature with our consciously analytical
   methods can we once again exercise dominion over nature that reminds us
   of our royal calling to subdue it.  Compared to the past, we recognize
   in this conscious approach something of the greater works of which
   Christ spoke.

               In this context I want to return to Jesus' parable of the
   mustard seed as well as that about yeast or leaven (Mat. 13, Mark 4).
   It is common for us to spiritualize these parables, but in so doing we
   miss their point entirely.  Throughout Jesus' works and words He always
   kept body and soul, spirit and matter, visible and invisible together
   in one totality.  In the light of that, what right do we have to
   exclude the empirical, the physical, and the visible that are so
   prominent in these parables from Jesus' prophecy and to consider only
   their spiritual aspect?  When Jesus spoke of the "more" that was
   awaiting us, He referred precisely to His works, among which His
   miraculous works automatically drew the most attention.  Most of those
   miracles revealed His power over the visible, the material and physical
   aspects of nature.  Hence, let us not separate what Jesus always
   regarded as one.  He concerned Himself with the whole person, both with
   poverty of the soul and with misery of the body.  Over against both of
   these He was Redeemer, the Liberator.  He delivered from sin as well as
   from the misery that encompasses us.

               It was in this context that Jesus pointed to the little
   mustard seed.  It is so very, very tiny.  But this tiny seed sprouts,
   grows up and goes through a process at the end of which we have a tree
   with its branches reaching out far and wide within which the birds of
   heaven make their home and which provides shade from the heat of the
   sun.  And so, said Jesus, it would be with the seed of the Kingdom.  It
   looks insignificant and trivial at the time it sprouts.  But then it
   begins to grow and go through an organic process until it is like the
   tree with its wide branches in the middle of the world to offer comfort
   and protection to people in their sin and in their physical miseries.
   The parable points to a dynamic situation in which we proceed through a
   series of stages of history.  It points to a penetration of the seed of
   that kingdom influence throughout our lives and to a future wherein
   both the spiritual and the material effects of that seed will become
   plain for all to see.  There is a constant "more."

               Similarly, the parable of the leaven or yeast illustrates
   for us the same process in its hidden action.  The miracle here is that
   when the yeast has come into contact with the flour, it sets into
   motion a mighty process.  Jesus' interest here was not in the external,
   instinctive action of the woman who bakes, but in what happens with
   that yeast in the flour as it works quite independently from the woman
   to obey the powers hidden within it.  Jesus penetrated the secrets of
   nature and showed how powers are hidden within it that would
   automatically set the process into motion until it would reach its
   fulfillment according to the natural laws governing this process.

               What right or reason would we have to restrict the
   significance of this meaningful prophecy about this kingdom process to
   the spiritual?  Is it not more legitimate to relate this process of the
   Kingdom to all of human culture?  Does not the power of this Kingdom
   touch our lives at all levels--spiritual, social and material?  And is
   that penetrative action in all areas not the result of that yeast or
   leaven?  When the Christian faith entered the world, it touched all the
   factors and laws of human society and by so doing completely changed
   the face of society.  Contrast the cultures that have been penetrated
   by that yeast and those that have not.  Where this faith has motivated
   people, it has affected their lives at all fronts, spiritually,
   socially and materially, and has elevated life to a higher level just
   as the bread rises through the fermentation of the yeast hidden in it.

               When you take the above perspective, you do not have to
   search long for evidence, for it is plain for all to see that wherever
   this liberation and elevation of the spirit has taken place, it is
   there that people have dedicated themselves to research and knowledge
   of nature and there that the control of nature has been increased in
   such a wonderful way.  True, the Greeks and Romans were also engaged in
   some research and among the Arabs considerable successes were booked.
   Nevertheless, the greatest scientific revolution was initiated and
   developed where the Spirit of God had liberated the human spirit with
   His touch.  And though it is true that science has subsequently turned
   its back to the Christian religion, the spirit, the motivating force
   that has guided this process arose and developed where that spirit had
   penetrated society.  If it were not for Jesus and the penetration of
   His Kingdom in the West, its people would still cringe helplessly
   before the gods of nature as did their ancestors.  It would be an
   insult to His greatness, were we to deny that Jesus did not foresee or
   intend this development.  He is the King of this process.  Unto Him is
   given all power in heaven and on earth.  When Jesus placed the leaven
   of His Kingdom in the bread of human society and promised the disciples
   that they would do works greater than His own, He in fact prophesied
   that this leaven would one day elevate all of society.  Though we
   admire His miracles, wherever His spirit of liberation strode, we see
   those greater works, we see a new and wonderful power and authority
   over nature that has been achieved through persistent, conscious
   analysis of its secret powers.  And the works emerging from that
   development Jesus described as greater than His own.

   [12] Kuyper's day, Bible translators have generally agreed that these
   last few verses of the Gospel of Mark were not part of the original
   manuscripts.  Most recent Bible translators relegate them to a note.
   However, the passage does correctly summarize what in fact took place,
   according to the book of Acts.

   [13] As already mentioned in the Introduction, I, the translator,
   consider Kuyper's writing to be an example of a style emerging from the
   "instinctive unconsciousness."

   [14] I know a young Nigerian who created a new type of Christian songs
   that combined aspects of the traditional music of his ethnic group with
   Christian themes.  In a short time he composed a considerable number of
   songs that were so popular that his songs were sung even by people of
   other ethnic groups.  Then the young man went to a teachers' college -
   and that was the end of his creativity.  His instinctive unconscious
   approach was stunted by the new consciousness he achieved through
   study.  However, since his was not a music or art college, he simply
   dropped his artistic activities.  His new consciousness did not help
   the development of his musical and poetic talents.  It appears that it
   was impossible for him to combine the earlier instinctive approach in
   art with a more conscious attitude to life in general.  The two
   approaches seem mutually exclusive.  In Nigeria, the emphasis on paper
   credentials has seriously contributed to this partially unfortunate
   development.

Chapter 5

                          THE SHREWDNESS OF THE WORLD

               Already in the Garden of Eden mankind was ordained to rule
   over nature, but because of the fall into sin and the subsequent curse
   that came upon all of creation, the severely weakened race lost his
   sovereignty.  However, in Christ, the Son of Man, this rule is restored
   and that in a three-fold manner.  First, immediately by means of the
   power to perform miracles directly, a power that His disciples
   inherited from Him.  Secondly, mediately by means of the enhanced
   development among mankind of its spiritual factors wherever the
   Christian religion triumphed.  Thirdly, at the time of His return, an
   event to which the New Testament does not tire of pointing as an
   indispensable component of the great work of deliverance.

               This then is the three-fold situation arising from the
   above.  First, Jesus restored human control over nature by giving the
   power of performing miracles.  Secondly, Jesus restored this same power
   on a much broader and lasting scale by means of the light that has gone
   through the nations and that has renewed their cultures.  Thirdly, at
   His return, Jesus will lead nature to its highest goal by means of
   final glorification.

               It would lead us too far astray from our present purposes
   to fully explain this third item.  Let a reference to the prophet
   Isaiah's statement suffice:

   The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the
   goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little
   child will lead them.  The cow will feed with the bear, their young
   will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox.  The
   infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child will
   put his hand into the viper's nest (11:6-8)


               This is obviously the promise of the final restoration of
   affairs to a situation similar to that before the fall.  The promise is
   expressed in Eastern poetry, but it is a powerful way of depicting the
   full restoration of peace within nature and of human control over
   nature.  This full restoration will not be realised until the return of
   Christ, but then it will spell the everlasting defeat of the power of
   Satan and the end of all the resistance evil spirits now offer us
   daily.  This restoration will come at the end of days, when the
   struggle is completed and the kingdom of glory has finally triumphed.

               While the above victory awaits the future, we already reap
   the benefits of the restoration of mankind's mediate control over
   nature.  This control comes to us in the second of the three phases.
   It is the power that we now have at our service and that has especially
   during the last century and a half developed at such a startling speed.

               This is not the immediate power to perform miracles as
   Jesus practised it when He was on earth.  This is a power of a totally
   different order that operates in a very different way.  In both kinds
   of power Jesus exercised over nature, that is both the power of working
   miracles as well as His mediate power, it is the spirit that subdues
   the physical but does so in a direct manner without using means.  In
   our present phase the spirit governs the physical mediately, that is,
   by means of the development of the human spirit.  This is the power of
   the spirit over the physical by means of science and technology.  In
   addition to science, we have resourcefulness, the brilliant move, the
   energy and the talent, perseverance and the will.  Nevertheless, all
   this is analyzed and explained primarily through science and
   technology.  Technology is the ability of mankind to subdue nature and
   includes medical science.  This immediate, direct power of ours over
   nature is a wonderful power, but it is not the same as miraculous
   power.

               This scientific and technological power has come to us
   through Christ.  His gospel has called forth a totally different and
   much higher development of the human spirit.  Wherever this gospel has
   taken hold, this development has taken place.  Out of this newer,
   richer and higher development of the spirit arose automatically the
   superior knowledge of and power over nature.  The credit for this
   development must go solely to Christ, not to any nation or race.

               It cannot be denied that through this second indirect,
   mediate phase of the restoration of control over nature we received
   through Christ, we achieve more than what Christ did through His
   miracles.  This is not to be seen as a higher power, for who has
   displayed higher power than Christ when the wind and storm obeyed Him,
   when He multiplied loaves of bread and raised the dead?  Nothing can be
   higher than that.  Our achievements are not greater in the sense of
   higher, but their superiority lies in their extent, their magnitude,
   their scale, their scope and their duration.  Jesus' miracles were
   always performed on a single individual or a single crowd and were
   restricted to a limited area.  Our present direct, mediate control over
   nature, the scientific, affects and influences all nations and people
   equally, year after year, and constitutes a blessing to millions
   simultaneously in all their problems and diseases.  And so this
   declaration of Jesus that His followers would do greater works than He
   did, strange as it may seem at first glance, can thus be fully
   explained.

               The above issues have frequently been misunderstood.  Many
   have assumed that anything that did not come out of the Christian faith
   was also beyond the sphere of Christ Himself.  The inventions of
   unbelieving scientists and the production of unbelieving artists have
   often been regarded as the works of the devil.  Jesus had nothing to do
   with these works.  His rule was limited to all that related to the
   salvation of souls for eternity.  The terrain where Christ exercised
   His royal sovereignty was regarded as excluding the evil direction of
   the spirit that guides the "world," that is the community of
   unbelievers, as well as all common human life.  The Biblical statement
   that God so loves the world that He gave His only son to deliver it was
   understood exclusively as referring to the elect.  The world itself was
   abandoned, while Jesus' coming was only for the salvation of the elect.

               Such a reduction of the Gospel flies in the face of what
   the Scripture teaches about the restoration of paradise, about the new
   heaven and the new earth and about the glorification of our body.  Thus
   many ended up with the untenable position of admitting that where the
   Christian religion has taken deep roots, culture has reached a higher
   degree of development, but denying that this development has anything
   to do with King Jesus and even regarding these developments as hostile
   to Christ.  The rich and comprehensive meaning of the Biblical
   assertion that "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to
   me," was not understood.  It is time we broaden our spiritual horizon
   and recognise that Jesus, as King, has sovereignty over the totality of
   human culture.  Once that is realised, it becomes inevitable that both
   our spiritual development unto eternal life and our general cultural
   development that has led to such an amazing increase in our knowledge
   and control over nature, are placed under His rule.  The contrast
   between human development in Muslim and other countries where the
   Gospel had not taken root and the West is sufficient evidence for this
   thesis.  Our spiritual awakening unto eternal life and our general
   human development are not independent from each other.  These are two
   operations within the one organism that exercise mutual influence on
   each other.  He who refuses to honour the majesty of Christ in both of
   these developments, robs Him of the full glory due to Him.

               Though we cannot accept it, it is not difficult to see how
   this failure to recognise the Kingship of Jesus over general cultural
   development has come about.  It is a fact that unbelievers have
   generally contributed more to the development of culture than believers
   have.  It is no accident that scientists who worship the Lord are a
   small minority among them.  The Lukan statement that "the people of
   this world are more shrewd...than are the people of the light" (Luke
   16:8), has been true throughout history.  That is to say, when it comes
   to nature and to the visible affairs of this world, unbelievers usually
   know how to exert greater power than do followers of Christ.  This
   statement does not constitute disapproval, for Jesus praised the
   manager for his shrewdness, though, it must be emphasised as well, not
   for his corruption.  There is no explanation here as to why this should
   be so.  The cause for this situation is not explored.  It is simply
   observed from experience that this is usually the case.  In the area of
   general cultural development, unbelievers often outdo the followers of
   Christ.

               The above trend can be observed already early in the Old
   Testament.  Abel prefers to wander around pensively with his flock,
   while Cain exerts himself with his spade in his farm.  Of Cain it is
   said that he built a city, though we must recognise that this would not
   be much more than a primitive community that protected itself against
   wild animals.  Nevertheless, Cain, the son of darkness, is associated
   in the Bible with the first technological advance.  In the next
   generations, it is not the descendants of believing Seth who are at the
   edge of progress, but those of the worldly Cain.  The credit for
   original development of the harp and flute goes to Jubal, of tents to
   Jabal and of bronze and iron tools to Tubal-Cain (Genesis 4).

               And so it continues throughout history.  Egypt was known as
   a pagan country, but it is there that Israel grew into a people and it
   is there that Moses was educated to prepare himself for his role as
   leader of his people.  King Solomon had to send to pagan Tyre to get
   Huram, a craftsman "experienced in all kinds of bronze work" (1 Kings
   7:13-13), to work on the temple.  In the days of King Saul there were
   no blacksmiths in Israel.  When they needed such craftsmen, they had to
   resort to other nations around them.  During its glory days, Israel
   never excelled in any area of science or art.  Commerce was mostly
   controlled by the Canaanites.  Israel's maritime fleet was puny
   compared to that of her neighbours.  Egypt, Assyria, Babylon and Persia
   all surpassed her in every science and art.  And then we have not yet
   mentioned the achievements of the Greeks and Romans.  The best
   historical musea in the world have very few artifacts from early Israel
   among their displays.  During the reign of Solomon there seems to have
   been a temporary unusual increase in wealth in Jerusalem, but even here
   there are good reasons to surmise that the artists employed were
   foreigners.

               This tendency can also be noted during the days of Jesus.
   The new cities of Caesarea and Tiberias sprang from foreign
   inspiration.  Even Jesus surrounded Himself with mostly simple
   fishermen from Galilee.  Among His followers were few intellectuals;
   Paul, Apollos and Luke represented the intellectuals in the New
   Testament church.  Apart from Paul's writings, New Testament and
   subsequent apostolic writings are products of divine inspiration; they
   are not the products of scholarship.

               The phenomenon we are describing is no accident.  Its basic
   cause is to be found in the psychological fact that for most of us our
   spiritual power is not sufficient to embrace both spheres, that of the
   kingdom of heaven and human culture.  Often, or, perhaps, usually, when
   the human spirit concentrates too much on cultural human development,
   the resulting science or art will encourage our ego, our selfishness,
   with such force that it becomes very difficult for the child of God in
   us not to be suppressed by our pride.  Some, like Newton and Agassiz,
   have taught us how to overcome this problem, but these two men are
   among the exceptions.  For most people it would appear that their
   achievements in science or art give them such satisfaction and pride
   that it becomes impossible for them to humble themselves in the worship
   and service of God.  The doubts that science and art can arouse in your
   heart can create a degree of spiritual confusion and temptation of
   which the ordinary believer can form no idea.  Engagement and success
   in these endeavours can create such pride and elevate the human being
   to such an extent that worship of the Almighty suffers severely.  Pride
   and humility do not make good bed partners.  How often do not our young
   people enter the university with a true confession of Christ, only to
   graduate as unbelievers?  The demands of this area of life are so
   absorbing, so comprehensive that it tends to keep people from looking
   up.

               There is another side of the coin.  The fear of losing
   their faith has kept many Christians from involving themselves in
   society.  The most concrete examples of such withdrawal are the hermit
   and the monk who lock themselves in their cell.  Believers are seeking
   after God, they want to enjoy fellowship with Him, but the world tends
   to divert their attention from this quest.  The result is that they
   will avoid the world altogether, avoid the temptation to be
   side-tracked and withdraw from society in order to achieve intimate
   communion with God.  The examples of hermit and monk are extremes.
   They do not represent the mainstream of Christians, but the tendency to
   avoid the world and to isolate yourself in your own circle of believers
   is still as overwhelmingly strong in many quarters as it has been
   throughout church history.  Though Calvinists have generally had a
   different perspective and have resisted the withdrawal symptom because
   of their doctrine of common grace, it cannot be denied that during the
   17th^ and 18th centuries they became unfaithful to their best insights
   and also tended to isolate themselves from society.

               Now, we may look down upon these negative escapist
   withdrawal tendencies and we must surely reject them, but not without
   honouring the quest for holiness that forms its deepest motive.  The
   wisdom of the Biblical rhetorical question, "What good will it be for a
   man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?" (Matthew
   16:26) stands.  When you involve yourself in the world, you will
   immediately be confronted with what is called the "world" that is, its
   unholy spirit, its pretentious temptations and the demonic background
   of its life.  True the Christian can overcome this "world," but when
   you feel insufficient and weak in your faith, it may be better to
   withdraw into the light than to fall away from it into the darkness of
   the world.

               As we devise a Christian approach to the world, we must
   keep in mind the tendencies and difficulties discussed so far.  The
   spiritual struggle demands that we constantly concentrate on all
   spiritual powers available to us.  If you work in the world, in order
   to achieve, you must concentrate all your spiritual power on the
   material and visible.  Both streams will continue to follow their own
   beds.  So it has been in the past, so it is today and so it is likely
   to continue.  On the one hand, there is a powerful development of human
   knowledge and skills, a development especially encouraged by people who
   concentrate all their spiritual powers in this area, but who for that
   very reason remain strangers to the mysteries of godliness and piety.
   On the other hand, there is that powerful development of the spiritual
   or religious life that is encouraged by the children of light who
   expend all their spiritual powers in this area.

               There are some reasons that would lead us to acknowledge
   that this tension was designed by God Himself.  After all, He is the
   almighty dispenser of gifts and talents.  In addition, it would seem
   that history itself shows that God was pleased to distribute His gifts
   and talents to develop human knowledge to the pagan peoples rather than
   to His own Israel.  Did not the pagan nations of Egypt, Babylon, Greece
   and Rome possess gifts for science and art of which Israel was
   deprived? Can we not clearly discern the difference between the sons of
   Seth and the sons of Cain throughout history?  Even when we come to our
   own time, do we not see the same tendencies at work?  We may pray all
   we want that those eminent scientists and artists humbly bow before
   Christ.  Sadly we may enquire why we cannot count such people in our
   fellowship.  But it does not seem to change.  It continues to be true
   that the gifts and talents necessary for general social developments
   are more generously distributed among the children of this world than
   among the children of light.

               It is only Calvinism that in its most flourishing periods
   has broken this general rule.  Calvinism has revived in us the
   realisation and hope that there are historical exceptions, not only of
   individuals, but of entire communities, that have followed a different
   spiritual direction. [15] Exceptions to the rule are possible, they
   exist, but this fact does not invalidate the general rule itself.

               Let us never lose sight of that fact that, even where this
   basic rule is operative, where the torch of higher scientific knowledge
   has been lit and power over nature has been greatly increased by people
   who personally reject the kingdom of Christ, such developments never
   take place outside of His divine ordinances.  Thus in this general
   cultural development, without forgetting its sinful and negative
   elements, we must recognise and honour the fact that these gifts have
   come to us through Christ.

Chapter 6

                            THE WORLD OF THE SPIRITS

               We have seen that the restoration of sovereignty over
   nature by the Son of Man has two aspects.  First, there is the
   immediate, direct power exerted by means of His miracles.  Secondly,
   there is the mediate, indirect power that through Christ has developed
   by means of the rise of scientific knowledge.  We have also seen how
   Christ referred to the effects of this scientific development as "the
   greater works" that His followers would perform.  This development took
   place thanks to the work of Christ, for He added the explanation,
   "because I am going to the Father" (John 14:12).

               This latter point is so important that it requires further
   explanation.  It cannot be denied that our superior knowledge of and
   control over nature arose in those cultures where the Christian
   religion took deep root.  However, that fact itself does not explain
   the relationship between this superiority and the influence of Christ
   on the hearts of men.  It might be self-explanatory if the scientists
   who discovered all this knowledge were mostly faithful Christians, but
   the opposite has largely been the case, with non-Christians having
   taken the lead, while Christians often avoided the enterprise.  There
   seems to be an inner contradiction here when we remember that Jesus
   emphasised that those who would do those greater works would be those
   who have faith in Him.  It is not possible to locate the origin of this
   higher power over nature in Jesus' royal reign and at the same time to
   separate this development from the faith.  Thus we are confronted with
   the question how it is possible that Jesus tied this development so
   closely to faith in Him, while in fact science has been practised
   without reference to Him and even in a spirit hostile to Him.  If we
   are to hold on to both of these, we will have to find a point of
   contact between them that will dissolve the apparent contradiction.

               Let us return to Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (Mat.
   4).  The Messiah appeared as the Son of Man in order to restore to us
   our rule over this earth.  Before He began His public ministry among
   Israel, the devil himself appeared to Him in the desert.  The devil
   claimed to have control over the kingdom of this world and to have the
   authority to hand over this rule to Jesus, provided Jesus would bow
   before him and worship him.  It will not do to regard this claim of
   satan as a baseless pretence, for Jesus Himself at one time referred to
   satan as the ruler of this world, a term that in effect makes satan the
   king.

               It was not only at this particular time in the desert that
   Jesus struggled with him over the power of this Kingdom.  Christ
   struggled with him throughout His ministry.  This struggle would not
   come to its victorious climax until its conclusion on the cross.
   Throughout Jesus' ministry, deliverance from demons was a prominent
   part of His programme. The power He gave to His disciples included that
   of casting out demons.  In a moment of holy ecstasy Jesus claimed that
   He "saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven" (Luke 10:18).  This
   struggle against Satan was so much in the foreground that in the Lord's
   Prayer, He included the phrase "And deliver us from the evil one."  It
   would be a thorough distortion of Jesus if we were to explain away His
   struggle with the devil psychologically, for this struggle was the
   essence of His ministry.  It is not without reason that the Apostles
   constantly emphasised the struggle between the Spirit that Jesus poured
   out and the spirit of Satan.  They opposed every attempt to cast the
   struggle of believers into an ordinary moral struggle.  As believers
   who have been delivered, we struggle "not against flesh and blood, but
   against ... the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realm"(Eph.
   6:12).  Till this day, "the devil prowls around like a roaring lion
   looking for someone to devour" (1 Peter 5:8).  When the final triumph
   of the church was depicted on the island of Patmos, the further
   outworking of this spiritual drama showed that Satan was once more
   freed, after which he is to be cast into the lake of fire, the event
   which will spell the complete defeat of all anti-Christian and
   anti-godly forces.  "The man of lawlessness" which Paul mentioned in II
   Thessalonians 2:3-12 "will be in accordance with the work of Satan
   displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders."  As
   in Jesus the Son of God became human and the eternal Word became flesh,
   so Satan attempted to incarnate himself, an attempt that constituted
   the height of blasphemy and that led to his eternal downfall.  Luther
   expressed this in his description of Satan as the ape or imitator of
   God in so far as he, in his struggle against God over control of this
   earth and of the human race, imitates or apes God in what God in His
   mercy prepared for our redemption.

               Liberal, modern theological studies have completely
   divorced the study of Jesus' work from this most crucial demonic
   background to His entire ministry and ignored it.  All the stories and
   sayings in the Gospels and apostolic writings concerning the world of
   spirits and demons are explained away as the result of imagination and
   superstition.  These were the categories of thought, it is alleged, of
   the superstitious civilization in which Jesus was brought up and that
   He also accepted.  Those superstitions, of course, were all in error.
   We modern people know better today and we must therefore re-interpret
   the Bible to suit the modern mind, thus dropping all serious
   considerations of this aspect of the Bible. References to demons and
   spirits must be explained psychologically.  Such methods of
   re-interpreting the Bible have sometimes been referred to as
   demythologizing, that is, taking the myths out of the Bible by
   explaining them away.

               It should not surprise us that such interpretations are
   advanced by scholars who see no more in Jesus than a prominent Jewish
   rabbi or teacher, or, perhaps, a religious genius. Such scholars cannot
   accept Him as the Bible presents Him and therefore must make Him
   palatable to their own tastes and theories.

               What is more difficult to understand is that even some
   scholars who regard themselves as orthodox believers and who claim to
   honour Christ in all His divinity, go along with various types of
   demythologizing by suggesting that Jesus not merely went along with the
   world view of the ancients, but that He actually shared their mistaken
   views.  Since we now know better, we are free today to reject that
   world view, including the demons and evil spirits.

               These views are mutually exclusive.  You cannot at the same
   time hold the opinions that Jesus is divine and that He was wrong.
   Some try to get around this difficulty by asserting that Jesus realised
   that their world view was false, but in order to have access to the
   hearts of the people He adjusted Himself to their way of thinking and
   complied with it.  This attempt is based on pure nonsense and flies in
   the face of all facts.  The temptation in the wilderness was a struggle
   into which He was led by the Holy Spirit and which was witnessed by
   none of His disciples.  Jesus' casting out of demons cannot adequately
   be understood as merely an attempt to adjust Himself to a wrong world
   view.  It constituted a serious struggle with demons during which they
   themselves spoke to Him.  Without any inducement from the disciples,
   Jesus said on His way to Gethsemane that the ruler of the world was
   about to make his last attack.  And how could Jesus possibly include a
   prayer for deliverance from the evil one in the Lord's Prayer, if Satan
   did not work in the hearts of people?  All such explanations are to be
   rejected without reservation.  His struggle with Satan to deliver the
   sheep of His pasture from the claws of the world is not a side issue in
   Jesus' life, but a dominant concern.  In fact, the entire history from
   the days of the Garden to Christ's return makes no sense whatsoever,
   unless one recognised the overwhelming dominance of the motif of the
   struggle between God and Satan for the soul of mankind.  Actually,
   during the days of Jesus' ministry the demons worked harder and had
   greater influence than normally.  The influence of spiritual powers,
   whether angelic or demonic, can vary from time to time.  At the time
   the battle between God and Satan was about to be decided, angels and
   demons intensified their activities beyond that of normal times.  Thus,
   to eliminate or to discount the influence of demons is in effect to
   completely distort a central aspect of the ministry of Christ among us.

               When you look at these issues carefully, you will realise
   that they are not only related to the reality or otherwise of angels
   and devils, but that they also touch spiritual life in general.  The
   conclusions of those who deny the existence of demons reach further and
   eventually lead logically to the denial of the existence of the soul,
   of the resurrection, of the very existence of God and finally forces
   upon them a reality that consists only of nature, of the body and of
   the physical.  Of course, for all these concerns are intertwined.  When
   you lock yourself up in a finite, closed world, you will turn that
   restricted vision into the measuring rod of all reality.  That
   measuring rod will then determine for you what is possible and what can
   or cannot exist.  You will have pulled the shutter over the window that
   gave you a view of the spiritual world and no longer see anything of
   the world.

               The measuring rod of the visible cannot measure the
   spiritual.  The spiritual is of a different nature, operates with
   different powers and proceeds according to other laws.  If you try to
   measure the spiritual world by the categories or laws of the physical
   and visible, and you are consistent, you are almost sure to arrive at a
   position that has no room left for miracles, spirits, souls or even
   God.  A fish cannot appreciate the grandeur of a great mountain range,
   because his vision and experience is restricted to its watery abode.
   Similarly, when you restrict your vision to the world of the visible,
   you will have no eye for the beauty and glory of the spiritual world.
   Even if you were still to acknowledge the reality of all that is
   beautiful and good, you will find yourself measuring it by the standard
   of the visible, as if it emerged from matter.  You will not know or
   recognise another, separate realm that has its own composition and that
   is not within reach of the measuring rod of the visible.  Science that
   takes a position above faith and against it ends up negating the entire
   spiritual realm.  Such science excluded the spiritual and is in fact
   another kind of distorted faith that has conformed to a one-sided
   science.  Such science has forfeited a place of honour that is rightly
   reserved for true science.

               The tense relationship between faith in such one-sided
   science and scriptural faith has somewhat softened in the Western world
   with the rise of a series of phenomena that are related to movements
   like spiritism, telepathy and clairvoyance.  This development has
   influenced a sizeable community to recognise certain puzzling phenomena
   and mysterious powers that would be worthwhile examining, even though
   such examination is not likely to lead anywhere, since we cannot
   penetrate that shadowy world with our reason.  Nevertheless, this
   situation has yielded us some gain in that even among non-Christian
   scholars there are those who admit to the existence of something like a
   spiritual world that wields a certain influence on our psychology and
   life.

               Though meager, this situation has yielded something
   positive for us.  It is now more generally admitted that there is more
   to reality than scholars had wanted to acknowledge.  People are once
   again becoming used to the idea that there exists another order of
   reality that is distinguishable from that of the visible.  It is
   realised now that we relate to this other world in a very different
   manner from that of the visible world around us.  It has been noted
   that, while some people have experienced nothing of this other world
   and laugh at it, others have contact with it and believe firmly in it.
   It can no longer be denied that there is a certain similarity here with
   what was earlier revealed by the prophets and apostles about another
   spiritual realm.

               Though the similarity is there, we should not jump to the
   conclusion that the prophetic and apostolic revelation was the same as
   that of spiritism, clairvoyance and the rest of them.  In fact, the
   differences are emphatic.  Nevertheless, the two share the affirmation
   of a realm other than the physical and that there are means whereby
   entities and powers from within that realm can communicate with us.
   There have even been those who were about to lose their Christian faith
   because of its affirmations about that realm, but who, under the
   influence of these newer movements, once again acknowledge that after
   all there is an eternal life after death.  To them the spirits causing
   tables to dance are as reliable evidence as the resurrection of Christ.

               Of course, faithful Christians will never stoop down to
   such outright heresy. Their communion with the spiritual realm is of a
   totally different character.  The Christian relationship to that realm
   does not depend on spiritualistic witnesses but rests on faith in God,
   a foundation as solid as a rock.

               Though Christians do not attach the great value to these
   phenomena that others attribute to them, there is nevertheless
   something positive about this development in the struggle between
   Christian and scientistic faith.  The short-sighted pretence of
   scientists who deny the possibility of that other realm has been dealt
   a serious blow.  The existence of this other realm is now admitted
   along with the fact that there are powers in that realm that cannot be
   explained scientifically.  The world of spirits with which they have
   come into contact almost automatically opens the way to believe in the
   existence of a spiritual world.  By this means the question arises
   spontaneously and necessarily as to what to make of this spiritual
   world and in which way this realm exerts its influence on the visible
   world and on mankind.

               In psychology the same development is taking place.  It is
   no longer satisfied with the vague data with which its practitioners
   used to operate.  It is assumed that psychological phenomena must
   reveal themselves in one or another in or through the body to the
   outside.  In so far as these phenomena, whether they are healthy or
   sickly, normal or abnormal, are visible or audible outside a person,
   they can be observed, touched, compared or contrasted, seen in relation
   to other phenomena and conclusions can be drawn from them. Though there
   are many who would prefer to explain such phenomena purely by
   determining their cause solely in the body, and though not a few deny
   the existence of the soul, the fact continues to impress itself upon us
   that the physical data are insufficient to explain what is observed.
   Thus, researchers are forced to accept that there is something in a
   person that does not have its origin in the physical and to acknowledge
   at the same time that this spiritual dimension has its own sphere in
   which other, peculiar laws operate and where the normal laws of nature
   do not apply.  In many aspects of the person, such as in thought life,
   imagination, dreams, artistic expression, sense of beauty, moral
   motivations and, yes, even in the way our sense of right and power is
   shaped, you run into phenomena that are shrouded in a mystery.  You
   could go on to the power of religion, to the mystery of love, to
   heroism and so much more, all of which touch our lives deeply in ways
   that defy explanation unless you admit to the influence of the
   spiritual realm on mankind.

               The materialistic attitude that has been so prevalent has
   lost some of its adherents among the finest thinkers.  A more spiritual
   attitude is gaining acceptance.  People are increasingly feeling and
   acknowledging that there is a mystical world to which we somehow stand
   in a certain relation.  The previous indifference is being replaced by
   the tendency to search for a mystical relationship to that world.  It
   is felt that there surely is that other sphere of spiritual life,
   knowledge of which such people deeply desire.  They thus open the
   portals of their hearts deeply in order to allow the influence of that
   mystical world to penetrate.  Hence, among our greatest scholars there
   is at present an excessive receptivity towards the spiritual.  The
   callous materialism that half a century ago was so rife in scholarly
   circles is now largely restricted to the pseudo-scholars, to business
   people and to the revolutionaries among the lower classes.

               Nevertheless, it is characteristic of our day that same
   circle of scholars that is presently so open to that mystical view,
   still wants nothing to do with the revelation of God that has come to
   us out of that mystical spiritual world in God's Word.  These people
   clamp on to what they have learned of Buddhism.  They delve deeply into
   Theosophy.  They attempt to resurrect the Spirit of the philosopher
   Hegel.  They will lend their ear to anything at all.  But as soon as
   you mention the special revelation of God that came to us in the
   prophets, in Christ and in the apostles, then you are suddenly faced
   with fierce opposition. They will agree that there is this spiritual
   world and that we have a relationship with it and that it is very
   important that we understand the relationship, but, that knowledge must
   come from within us, from our own conjectures and findings, from our
   own rational activities, from our own pondering and meditating.  We
   human beings, we must be the source of this knowledge.  That this
   knowledge might be revealed to us by God by His own means is not
   allowed.

               Believers themselves certainly share in the responsibility
   for this development.  I am, not suggesting that believers also have
   denied revelation.  The contrary is true.  Nevertheless, even with them
   the broad mysterious background of this revelation has been relegated
   to the insignificant.  Ask yourself what significance the host of
   angels still has for most believers or how they regard the influence of
   demons and Satan.  How many believers have not completely come to
   disregard these agents?  They may not deny their existence, but they
   have become mere meaningless figures for them. [16]   If these beings
   were to cease to exist, it would have no difference on their
   watered-down faith.  Oh, of course, they adhere to the influence of the
   Holy Spirit on their souls.  But casting out of demons by Jesus and His
   disciples is by many believers regarded as psychological healing of
   disturbed patients.  Even in the preaching of the Gospel much of what
   the Gospels tell us about that spiritual world disappears without a
   trace.  And if you point to Satan as the ruler of the world who took by
   plunder what belonged to the Son of Man and that this kingdom was
   restored to its rightful owner through Golgotha and the open grave,
   then you are taking your audience to a terrain that is completely
   foreign to them.  They have never regarded the power of Satan over this
   world and over the spirits as real, as actual.  For this reason, they
   cannot recognise the greatness of Christ's victory over Satan.  This is
   precisely the reason they fail to understand how Christ made possible
   the subjection of nature to the human spirit by His coming into the
   world and breaking the spiritual power of Satan, while freeing the
   human spirit.  This attitude of believers has provided the basis for
   the rejection of the revelation of God on the part of scientists who
   are otherwise open to the existence of a spiritual realm.  Thus the
   church shares the burden of responsibility for this development.

Chapter 7

                       THE EFFECTS OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD

               It is clear, then, that we must continue to insist on the
   influence of the world of spirits on our world as Jesus attested.
   Similarly, we must hold on to the fact that Satan and his demons have a
   real effect on our world.  But we are then directly faced with the
   question how we must visualise their operation.  We know absolutely
   nothing about this matter, except from the Scripture.

               Hence we are faced with a mystery.  That spirits can
   influence each other, we experience daily.  We also know from
   experience that our spirit affects our body.  But neither experience
   nor science can answer the question as to how one spirit can affect
   another or how our spirits influence our bodies.  Those influences take
   place in a sphere where our powers of observation have reached their
   limits.  Here we are dealing with feelings, impressions, emotions and
   experiences.  However, it is beyond us to determine the way this all
   works.  We know the effect; we do not know the method, and every effort
   to discover it has failed.

               It is clear that sometimes the spirit of one individual
   person is stronger than that of another and can more easily make an
   impression than the spirit of another person.  It is also true that one
   spirit is more receptive to another's influence than some are.  It has,
   furthermore, been observed that it sometimes is easier to influence the
   spirit of a large crowd than each member of that crowd individually,
   but we are in the dark when it comes to the question of how this
   hypnotic or suggestive power works, on what power it is based and how
   it achieves its purpose.  Even in a love affair we have an unsolved
   mystery, especially in cases where one single momentary glance can make
   such an emotional impression on a young man or woman that they find
   themselves drawn to each other by an irresistible power as if magnetic
   forces fuse their souls to each other.  We all have a spirit within us
   and we get in touch with other spirits daily, but no one can analyse
   what that spirit actually is.  All attempts at describing it fail us.
   We know what a spirit is not, but we do not know what it is.  We know
   that a spirit has power, but how that power resides in the spirit, how
   it is activated or to what laws it is subject remains a hidden secret
   for us.  We can observe that somewhere our soul makes contact with our
   nervous system, because it is through our nervous system that we absorb
   the experiences of our lives and of our senses into the soul, but where
   this point of contact is located, we do not know.  One person holds the
   opinion that the soul is spread throughout the body; another locates it
   in our heart; a third puts it in the brain.  Via amputation we can lose
   significant parts of our body without the spirit within us suffering at
   all.  There are also parts of our body that cannot stand any
   significant damage without our losing consciousness immediately.  Here
   you can guess, you can surmise, you can theorize all you want, but you
   will not arrive at any certainty.

               So, most questions in this area remain unanswered and we
   are unable to account clearly for the way in which our spirit
   influences our body, but no one doubts the fact of this influence.
   That fact is confirmed every moment of our lives.

               If we apply the above concerns to the spiritual realm that
   exists in the world outside of the human race and we start off with the
   revealed fact that there is indeed such an external spiritual realm,
   then it is obvious that there must be a certain relationship between
   the spirits that exist out there and those that are within humans.
   They have at least in common that both sets of beings are spirits and
   thus the characteristic features of our own spiritual life can also be
   found in those other spirits.  We cannot go beyond this point.  Our
   human spirituality may have peculiarities not shared by those other
   spirits and vice versa.  Whatever gap there may exist, these others,
   too, are spirits and thus a type of being that shares certain basic
   characteristics with our own spirituality.

               It is neither strange nor unnatural that these spirits
   could remain holy or desecrate themselves and that we can thus speak of
   good angels and fallen angels, of holy spirits and of demons.  Of these
   evil spirits it may also be assumed that they can influence each other
   in the sense that one of them, as Satan, can exert a dominating
   influence over the other demonic spirits.  Similarly, it can generally
   be assumed that both good and evil spirits can exert influence on the
   human spirit.  Both demons and good angels can affect us.  Going one
   step further, it can hardly be denied that, as our spirit affects our
   body and thus the material, so both good and evil spirits can affect
   the visible world.

               The Scripture insists on this possibility.  It teaches us
   that all spirits are serving spirits.  That means a number of things:
   they have a service to perform; they are called to service; they have
   received the properties and powers necessary to perform it; this
   service is not restricted to heaven, but reaches out to this earth and
   its human inhabitants.  Similarly, the good spirits affect our lives.
   They are partners in the great battle for the Kingdom of God.  They
   rejoice in the fields of Ephratha.  They are eager to participate in
   the work of deliverance.  They are sent out to serve those who will
   inherit salvation.  In the last day they will triumph along with Christ
   and those whom He delivered.  We must not picture them as if they live
   in isolation above, while we live in separation here below.  They
   participate in all our affairs.  They rejoice and sorrow along with
   us.  That in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus the angels
   deposited poor Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham is an imaginative
   expression of the participation of angels in our lives.

               Not only does the Scripture teach that the good angels can
   affect us, but the fallen angels, the demons, can as well affect us as
   they seek our destruction.  This was not their original inclination,
   but Satan wants to separate us from God and to draw us into his own
   kingdom.  Satan has been called the "brother of Christ" in order to
   emphasise his pre-eminence among the spirits.  It is exactly that
   pre-eminence that tempted him to rebel against God.  Since then, all of
   his energies have been directed against the Kingdom of God in order to
   promote his own kingdom.  To this end he does all he can to subject
   mankind to his own designs.  In this attempt he has the advantage of
   unusually strong powers that stand ready to do his bidding.  His
   preeminence goes along with great gifts and unusual powers.  These
   qualities were meant to be used by him in the service of God, his
   Creator.  Satan did not lose these qualities after his fall, but
   instead used them against God and His anointed one.  These powers were
   first displayed in the Garden at the time he deceived our ancestors to
   fall into sin.  Since that time, the Scriptures portray him restlessly
   sowing spiritual destruction among mankind, frustrating the grace of
   God working for our liberation and promoting his own kingdom on earth.
   He has been called the "ruler of this dark world" (Eph. 6:12) and the
   "prince of this world" (John 12:31, 14:30).  The government of this
   world, promised by God to mankind, has been taken over by him.  Through
   the use of all sorts of unholy, secret powers Satan keeps the children
   of men and the nations caught in his traps.  Charms and magic are among
   his unholy arsenal of powers by which he retains the souls of people.
   This demonic rule stood unchallenged and unrestrained until the
   appearance of Christ.  At that time he doubled his efforts and powers
   and turned the battle into a personal struggle against the anointed one
   in order to retain his own rule as prince of the world and to frustrate
   the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven.

               In this power struggle Satan exerts influence over other
   demonic spirits by subjecting them to his will and thus making them
   subservient to the fulfillment of his designs.  Similarly, Satan works
   in the human spirit to lead people astray, to catch them in his net and
   to destroy the seed of piety in them.  He also affects the body and the
   material, as we see so graphically in Jesus' days in those who were
   demon possessed.  He even penetrated into Jesus' inner circle: he led
   Jesus to His destruction, brought Peter into danger and eventually
   tempted and led people astray everywhere, so that Jesus laid the
   prayer, "Deliver us from evil" on the lips of all His followers.  In
   our own day, Satan's power comes and goes, wanes and waxes, but in
   Jesus' days, Satan's attacks were particularly vicious as we witness in
   the incidents of those possessed by demons in such overwhelming ways,
   that the demons themselves spoke to Jesus, "What do You want with us,
   Jesus of Nazareth?  Have You come to destroy us? I know who You
   are--the Holy One of God!" (Mark 1:24-26; Luke 4:31-35).  Jesus cast
   them out and at one time even had them invade a herd of swine which
   then went berserk and jumped into the nearby sea (Mat. 8, Mark 5, Luke
   8).  We are talking here about a spiritual influence and power that is
   not restricted to affecting the human spirit but that can also affect
   the human body and even the human personality.  The incident of the
   swine shows that even the animal kingdom is drawn into its orbit.

               It will not do to regard this influence of the spirits on
   our lives an unusual circumstance, for such a view cannot do justice to
   the phenomena under discussion.  The Scripture hardly encourages such
   an interpretation.  To the contrary, it depicts Satan as "your enemy
   the devil" who "prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone
   to devour" (I Peter 5:8).  Paul asserted that we are struggling "not
   against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the
   authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the
   spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (Eph. 5:12), a
   struggle that knows no relief, but in which we are restlessly engaged
   from moment to moment.  We need to call upon our God every morning and
   every evening for Him to "deliver us from the evil one."  And it is not
   only our own spiritual life that is constantly under threat of invasion
   and overpowering, but the same holds for all of nature.  We read, "For
   the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but
   by the will of the one who subjected it."  Further, "The whole of
   creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to
   the present time" in the hope that it "will be liberated from its
   bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children
   of God" (Rom. 8:19-22).

               We are not talking here about occasional exceptional
   events, but about a constant and dark influence exerted over all
   aspects of life and creation, of a demonic oppression that is exercised
   everywhere in our human society as well as throughout our world.  That
   oppression came with the curse and as the nations wandered farther and
   farther away from God, it increased.  That curse was dealt its lethal,
   principal blow with the coming of the Messiah, and, thanks to the
   pouring out of the Holy Spirit, it is significantly tempered or
   restrained where the Christian church is present.  However, this
   oppression will not be totally done away with until Satan has been
   bound for eternity and the glorification of God's children, along with
   the establishment of the new heaven and the new earth, will have taken
   place at the return of Christ.

               The spirit does not simply repose or rest in the material,
   but it carries the material along.  Through His almighty providence and
   the majesty of His will, God preserves the universe in its make-up.
   That almighty providence is present everywhere.  There is not one
   creaturely spirit and not even one unit of the most microscopic
   material that does not owe its preservation to that almighty
   providence.  All creation is at each point and at each moment carried
   along, preserved and empowered through this providential power of God,
   that resides everywhere in creation and motivates it.  God, of course,
   is a spirit.  To Him clings nothing that is visible or physical.  Thus
   it is the almighty Spirit of God that created and upholds not only the
   creaturely spirit, but also the realm of the visible.  No matter how
   deeply the sciences may penetrate into the composition, laws and powers
   of nature, they will never be able to touch the spiritual essence or
   base on which it all rests.  Even when the physical material turns out
   to be all motion and power, science will not get beyond the motion and
   power.  It is beyond the reach of science to determine how God, a
   Spirit, works within this material creation and motivates it.  It is
   simply impossible to know anything about this subject, unless God
   reveals it to us.  For this reason it is necessary for those of us who
   desire to form at least a vague conception of the spiritual base,
   constantly to return to His revelation.

               Attempts have been made to prove the above without resort
   to divine revelation, but these have led from one error into another,
   from the pan into the fire.  A superficial attempt has been made by
   appeal to Deism.  This is the view that God has created this universe
   like a clock that automatically runs on and on without God having
   anything further to do with it.  Still others have sought comfort in
   Pantheism.  This view has it that as human beings have bodies infused
   with a soul that inspires and enlivens it, so can the entire universe
   be seen as a gigantic body of which God is the soul.  In this view God
   has no existence apart from His creation and is exhausted by it. This
   God becomes conscious only in the human consciousness, but He has no
   independent existence or consciousness and is not marked by holiness.
   These views represent worldly wisdom to which they resorted who were
   interested in such questions but who would not accept God's holy
   revelation.

               It was over against this pseudo-wisdom that Jesus and the
   apostles placed the divine wisdom that was hidden from the learned and
   wise for generations, but that was eventually revealed to little
   children (Mat. 11:25).  Thus, we do not just have this little earth
   with our God far and high above it with nothing in between but death,
   but we have a creation of God that is filled with wonderful and rich
   life.  There are 10,000 times 10,000 angels, as the apostle of Patmos
   expressed it.  Those innumerable spirits are not just a jubilating and
   praising host, they are not merely marginal figures in the great drama
   of creation, but they are powerful heroes that carry out the Word of
   God.  All these hosts are His servants who carry out His pleasure.
   They have a service to perform, a call, a task that basically is
   nothing else than to obey the voice of His word.  They neither sleep
   nor rest, but they are forever busy in the fulfillment of their
   service.  They are borne up by God Almighty, who appears in and through
   them as a personal power.  Christ is appointed head over all this
   host.  Under Him are the good angels of God, who form the host that
   restrains all demonic influences and seeks to overcome and destroy
   them.

               It is not possible to restrict all this to the spiritual
   realm.  There simply is no barrier that would prevent any point of
   contact between the spiritual and the material.  The angels also affect
   the material, as the Scriptures show us repeatedly.  This effect is
   demonstrated especially by the demonic spirits.  It is precisely
   through the visible that they try to tempt us and bring us down.  At
   first glance, the sin of pride would seem the most purely spiritual in
   nature, but even this sin often expresses itself in the material
   through money or goods, through honour or power.

               Over against those angels that serve God without ceasing,
   there are the fallen angles.  The latter did, of course, cease to serve
   God and now have no other task than to break down the Kingdom of God,
   but they do so with the powers and gifts with which God at one time
   equipped them for His service.  They have retained the ability of
   approaching souls, to entice and tempt them, to affect our souls and
   thus exert influence over the material.  This phenomenon is stronger in
   those possessed by demons than most of us experience today, but this
   "service to destruction," as the apostle called it, continues so that
   all of life's evil and abuse that cannot be squared with God's love and
   holiness, must be explained on basis of these demonic influences.  Life
   is covered by an impenetrable veil behind which takes place a struggle
   of spirits that we cannot explain and of which we only observe its
   effect on our lives.

               All superstition has its cause in that mysterious
   background of our lives.  People sensed the effects of this mysterious
   power in their lives and they felt the need to oppose it.  But, instead
   of seeking help against this oppressing power and deliverance from it
   from God and His good angels, people depended on their own wits and
   sought to overcome evil by means of magic.  This practice was, in fact,
   tantamount to serving and worshipping the demonic spirits themselves.
   People feared the power of these spirits and tried to gain their
   favour.  In some circles this has actually developed into an open,
   unabashed service and worship of the evil one.  Whatever form it took,
   the intent of this superstition and demonic magic was invariably to
   control this demonic influence by means of the demonic.  The result has
   been that spiritually the nations found themselves tied more and more
   to the demonic.  The spiritual was feared as a threat rather than
   recognised as a liberating force.  People sensed the net in which they
   were caught, but they did not know how to extricate themselves from
   it.  People felt themselves surrounded by a demonised nature.

               Over against such a situation, Moses spoke these words of
   God, "The nations listen to those who practice sorcery or divination.
   But as for you, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so.  The
   Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your
   own brothers.  You must listen to him" (Deut. 15:14-16).  By this
   means, it was only among Israel that this demonic power was broken in
   principle.  When the promised Prophet finally was announced
   victoriously, "This is my beloved Son.  Hear Him," the struggle in the
   wilderness between Christ and Satan began immediately.  It was then
   that Satan's head was crushed on the cross.  It was then, in the hour
   of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, that a new power was released
   through the church to enter the world.  This new power created an
   atmosphere of liberation for the human spirit so that the children of
   God could begin to develop themselves in freedom.  That moment signaled
   the unfettered development of the human spirit.  Gradually superstition
   was pushed back, this time not by resorting to magical tricks, but by
   research.  By hard and serious scientific study, liberated mankind was
   able to recover its power over nature.

Chapter 8

                                CHRIST AND SATAN

               When you meet anyone who professes not to believe in the
   existence of Satan and his demons, you can generally be sure that
   person has fallen into the clutches of Satan.  Christ and Satan work in
   opposite ways.  Christ does not leave a stone unturned to reveal His
   Name and thus redeem, but Satan does all he can to keep himself hidden
   from you so that he can destroy you by means of the mysterious
   influences he exerts over you.  Here light and darkness stand over
   against each other.  Christ is the light that constantly extends its
   rays farther and farther, while Satan represents the darkness that
   forever withdraws itself into dark and shadowy places in order,
   eventually, to lose himself along with all the world in the terror of
   the night.  Not to believe in the existence of Satan and his influence
   is extremely dangerous, for this is just the attitude that will allow
   Satan to capture your heart.  It is a form of backsliding and evidence
   of a weakening faith so that even in the Church of Christ and in the
   proclamation of the Gospel, these demonic powers are increasingly
   ignored.

               There is some evidence for this alarming development.  When
   people recite the Lord's Prayer, they all pray, "Deliver us from the
   evil one," but in free, spontaneous prayers we seldom call upon God to
   cover us with His shield against the poisonous arrows of Satan.
   Therefore, if the Kingdom of Christ is to regain its glory also in our
   eyes, it is imperative that we emphatically insist that Jesus Himself
   saw His life struggle as one fierce battle against Satan and that
   Jesus' view of Himself is of decisive importance for us.  We know
   nothing about the spiritual realm from ourselves, but He who came down
   to us from heaven, from the spiritual world, He has every right to
   speak in this respect.  What we received from His lips was revelation
   and all those who confess that Christ is the way, the truth and the
   life, must take that revelation seriously.  True, belief in the
   existence of this spiritual realm has been mixed up with superstitions
   against which we cannot struggle enough.  However, to assert that faith
   in the existence of a demonic world is the fruit of mere superstition
   is nothing more than short-sighted superficiality.  Throughout the
   centuries it has been the most profound and sensitive souls who have
   sensed that they were engaged in a mighty struggle for life against
   this demonic world.

               Our point of departure is thus the sure data of
   revelation.  These include the following twelve points:

   1.  There exists a spiritual world outside of and apart from our human
   race.

   2.  There are two hosts or groups of these spirits, namely angels and
   demons.

   3.  The host of demons is subject to the rule of Satan.

   4.  Both angels and demons have powers, gifts and talents that they
   received from their Creator.

   5.  These spiritual beings have been called to use their powers and
   gifts in the service of God, not only to praise Him, but also as
   instruments for the development of His Kingdom.

   6.  These spirits exert all kinds of influence on this earth, not only
   in the spiritual realm, but just as much in the physical, visible and
   material realm.

   7.  After their fall, the demons have misused their powers in order to
   destroy both this earth and our human race.

   8.  Until the coming of Jesus and with the exception of Israel, these
   demons had established the kingdom of Satan over the peoples and
   nations that made Satan in effect the ruler of the world.

   9.  Christ has come in order to destroy the works of the devil and to
   establish Himself as Head and King over this world.

   10.  The temptations of Christ in the wilderness and the gradual
   casting out of demons must be understood in the context of that
   struggle.

   11.  The power of Satan was broken down in principle during this
   struggle, so that Jesus could exclaim, "I saw Satan fall like lightning
   from heaven" (Luke 10:18).

   12.  The outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost introduced into
   this world a holy spiritual force that was designed to ceaselessly push
   back that demonic atmosphere that had for so long oppressed the life of
   the nations.

               Scripture testifies that from the time of Pentecost Satan
   has been bound.  At the end of days he will once again be released with
   all his demonic powers (Rev. 20:7).  Among the implications of the
   prophecy is that in our present age, Satan is not in full control of
   himself.  This is true not only in the sense that Satan's plans could
   never go beyond what God would allow him, but also that the Kingdom of
   Christ constantly chips away at the kingdom of Satan, so that the
   spiritual environment that through the Holy Spirit dominates in the
   church of the living God radiates out into the world and restrains the
   effects of Satan's power.  This is not to be understood as if Satan's
   power has already been destroyed and thus can be ignored.  The Lord's
   Prayer teaches us that this struggle of the evil one to destroy us
   continues and the apostle emphasised that behind the flesh and blood
   lies the fearful struggle with "the powers of this dark world and
   against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (Eph.
   6:12).

               Since the coming of Christ and the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit, a great change has come about.  Presently we recognise the
   existence of two very different, opposing, kingdoms on earth.  One is
   that of the demonic that can be identified by its operations and
   influence among the unbelieving communities of this world.  The other,
   standing next to and opposed to the former, is a totally different
   kingdom that is covered by holy baptism and where the Holy Spirit is
   the dominating power.

               This symbolism is implied in the sacrament of baptism.  The
   origin of baptism lies in the ancient image that, as water can clean
   the dirt from our bodies and clothes, so can spiritual cleansing take
   place by water, whether by sprinkling or immersion.  Such religious
   water rituals are found among almost all the peoples of the world.

               Members of pagan nations who wanted to be incorporated into
   Israel had first to undergo the so-called proselyte baptism.  That is
   to say, they were to be symbolically cleansed from the contamination
   that clung to them as pagans.  The symbolic meaning of this proselyte
   baptism was enhanced in various ways.  For one, the baptismal candidate
   had to break all his relationships with home and family.  The laws of
   Moses strongly emphasised the difference between the clean and the
   unclean.  Many objects and beings were considered unclean or unholy
   such as various types of animals, the sick, human corpses, cadavers and
   others.  Rituals for cleansing abounded in their culture in order to
   emphasise that demons affected not only the soul and the intangible
   world, but also the body, the physical.

               For this reason, the baptism of John, Jesus and His
   apostles touched the raw nerve of Jewish pride so dramatically.  This
   new baptism included Israel in the categories of the unholy and the
   unclean.  It prophesied the coming of a new Kingdom, the Kingdom of
   Heaven, which by its nature excluded both Jew and Gentile, so that both
   had to undergo this cleansing before entering that new Kingdom.

               That is the reason the early church tied the rite of
   exorcism to that of baptism.  Before being baptised, the candidates had
   to deny Satan and free themselves from his service and influence.  This
   promise was made on behalf of baptised infants by those who presented
   them for the sacrament.  This practice of combining these two rites
   served to emphasise the rich meaning of the sacrament of baptism in a
   concrete way.

               The problem arose with the second generation of
   Christians.  The children of Christians could not possibly be placed on
   the same level as those of Jews and Gentiles.  Born of Christian
   parents, these children are considered holy and clean in the New
   Testament.  They were not born in demonic territory, but in territory
   where the Holy Spirit held sway.  For this reason, the rite of exorcism
   did not make sense when applied to such children.  Hence some of the
   churches of the Reformation rejected the association of infant baptism
   with exorcism.

               With this the question has not been answered as to whether
   or not the old practice should not apply to the baptism of converts
   from other religions, whether, Jew, Secularist, Muslim or
   Traditionalist.  Such converts do not come from holy, but from unholy
   territory.  Through baptism they enter the holy territory.  Literally,
   they move "from the dominion of darkness" into "the Kingdom of the
   Son""(Col. 1:13).  It would seem to us, therefore, that when we take
   seriously the principal distinction between holy and unholy territory,
   it may be advisable that converts from other religions, when they are
   baptised, also undergo the rite of renouncing the devil.

               The difference between the baptism of John and that of the
   church was in fact that the latter was performed with the Holy Spirit.
   This implies two things.  First, children of Christian parents do not
   need to be transferred to this holy terrain, for they are born into
   it.  Thus, there is no need for exorcism in their case.  Secondly,
   those converted from other religions are born in unholy territory.
   Through baptism they are transferred into the holy in order to make a
   clean break with the ruler of this world and replace him with Christ
   the King.

               The entire doctrine of the covenant of grace depends on
   this distinction, a distinction that requires that we regard the work
   of the Holy Spirit in its broadest sense.  Those who limit the work of
   the Holy Spirit to the regeneration of the soul, forget that the Holy
   Spirit radiates from our spirits throughout all the aspects of our
   lives and thus creates a totally different atmosphere.  Satan created a
   demonic atmosphere through his effect on the souls of Gentile nations,
   but the Holy Spirit has an even greater effect when with divine
   omnipotence He penetrates human life once He has established His own
   center of radiation in the church.

               With all this, we are not suggesting that the line of
   separation between the holy and unholy territories can always be
   observed.  The church in the prosperous city of Corinth was little more
   than a very small oasis in a moral wilderness.  The few Christians
   there were not very influential in the city.  The dominant atmosphere
   of the city remained pagan.  In fact, there was great danger that the
   demonic influences radiating from that pagan atmosphere would penetrate
   the church of Christ.  That is the reason for Paul's sharp admonitions
   in his letters to this church.  It was only later, when the majority
   were baptised, that the church could influence public affairs.

               This process of Christianisation took even more time among
   the tribes and nations of Central and Northern Europe.  With such
   massive peoples' movements it was only to be expected that the
   Christian life at first would be no more than a veneer.  Under the
   veneer of Christianity the old paganism continued with its destructive
   demonic influences.  The continuation of this ancient pagan spirit
   revealed itself not only in the retention of pagan customs and in a low
   level of morality, but also in the tendency to restrain demonic powers
   by means of superstitious practices.  Occasionally such situations
   could degenerate to such an extent that a kind of satanic worship was
   established.  The ancient traditions encouraged attempts to incorporate
   these demonic powers, to seek reconciliation with them, to make them
   subservient, and all of this would find expressions in shameful
   orgies.  These traditions would express themselves in many forms of
   superstition and they have left us with fearful memories of awful
   with-hunts and witch trials.

               The church and, upon the church's insistence, the
   government sensed clearly the great danger that threatened the
   Christian community from the side of these demonic influences.  Today
   there is the tendency to interpret all of this superstition as the
   result of ignorance and delusions.  For those who deny the existence
   and the power of these unholy spiritual powers, that is the only
   interpretation possible.  The Christian church never accepted that
   view.  The church knew from the Gospel and from her Lord and King that
   these demonic powers were too real to deny.  We have every right to
   regard such a widespread revelation of devilish appearances as a strong
   attempt of Satan to interfere in the Kingdom of Christ in order to
   retain his own influence and to prevent the expansion of the sacred
   territory of the Holy Spirit.  The mistake of the church and government
   of those days was not their recognition that they were dealing with
   demonic powers.  Their mistake was that they sought to battle against
   these phenomena with sword and persecution instead of with spiritual
   means.  Because of this mistake, the struggle of the Christian church
   against these demonic powers constitutes a very somber, dark and
   shameful page in its history.  This was not the casting out of demons
   by means of high spiritual superiority of which we read in the days of
   the apostles.  This was an attempt to achieve by persecution through
   fire and sword what could only be undermined and overcome by spiritual
   means.

               The formula used in the Reformed Church for the Lord's
   Supper followed a better way.  Here the demonic is attacked in its
   nerve center. It acknowledges that even in the Christian church traces
   of this evil are found, but the power to resist is sought in
   ecclesiastical discipline and in exclusion from the sacrament of the
   Lord's Supper. This spiritual attack has been so successful that in no
   church has superstition been erased as thoroughly as in Calvinist
   churches.  The prime initiative came from the churches and their attack
   was purely spiritual in nature, [17] though governments also sought to
   suppress these evils.

               One dangerous side of this continued demonic influence was
   that people thought they could break its power by means of magic.  In
   other words, they sought to stem the fatal influence of Satan by means
   obtained from Satan himself!  That constitutes superstition.  It is the
   belief that there are secret means to resist the evil effects of
   demonic powers, whether these powers tempt us to sin, or lead to
   sickness or evil in person or animal, or disturb life by means of other
   fearful phenomena.  Superstition seeks deliverance through amulet,
   talisman, magical formula or incantation.  Satan is thought to have
   created evil by magic, and superstition seeks to overcome him by even
   stronger magic.  By trying to overcome the demonic with demonic means
   people in fact confirmed the rule of the demonic in their hearts.  It
   looked better when deliverance could be attributed to a religious relic
   or symbol associated with the Christian religion.  However, in essence
   it was still an attempt to meet the demonic with an external, secret
   magical power instead of facing it with the spiritual force of the Holy
   Spirit.  The Christian veneer of relic or symbol did not render the
   attempt less magical.

               Because of this fatal mix-up, it took centuries to erase
   this superstition from the public life of countries where the Gospel
   was slowly penetrating deeper and deeper.  Among peoples still under
   the sway of traditional religions and Islam we find that all sorts of
   secret working of demonic origin, no longer common among Christianised
   people, are still daily occurrences.  Such people continue to depend on
   magical formulas to resist demonic influences. [18]

               Nevertheless, even now we should not fool ourselves into
   thinking that there are no traces of superstition left among the
   Christianised people of the world.  Gambling and other types of games
   encourage belief in the effect of a mysterious fate on our lives.  You
   will find fortune tellers and soothsayers in all large cities.  Members
   of the highest social classes seek their advice.  Various superstitious
   means are used throughout Christianised people to determine the number
   of people with whom a person should sit at the dining table or the day
   of arrival of a certain ship at sea.  In even the most highly cultured
   circles where sensitivity and experience of the Holy Spirit is lost,
   you find that people resort to spiritism and clairvoyance, as if they
   have access to greater light there than they have in the Light of the
   Gospel.

               We do not deny that there is truth in all these phenomena
   or that they are worth our attention.  But evil creeps in when the
   Gospel is pushed aside and people search for a higher revelation in
   these phenomena than has been given us in Christ.  Do not forget that
   the Bible teaches that even Satan can work signs and miracles.  For
   this reason, Christians have constantly to be aware of the need to test
   the spirits.

               It is only the greater power that radiates from the Holy
   Spirit throughout private and public life that can deliver us
   permanently from the dominion of these demonic powers and
   superstitions.  Christ, our King who is seated at the right hand of
   God, has poured out the Holy Spirit into the midst of our lives.  By
   means of this Spirit, Christ has established the church, of which He is
   head, as a spiritual power on earth whose workings and influence
   already serve as instruments of His dominion.  The influences of this
   Holy Spirit radiate far beyond the limited circle of this living
   church.  You can find its traces in the life of the people, in public
   opinion, in the law, on morals and customs, in short, everywhere.
   Those influences of the Holy Spirit have formed a dam that obstructs
   the flow of the demonic.  It is in this way that the Holy Spirit has
   gradually freed public life from demonic powers.

               The Christianised peoples of the world are free. [19]   The
   superstitious attempts to control the results of the curse by magical
   means has largely disappeared from among them.  This freedom, this
   liberated spirit has awoken in them the power and realisation that,
   through scientific research, inventiveness and penetration into the
   mysteries of nature, it is possible once again to master the mysterious
   powers of nature that God has created.

               Those who see in Christ only the Saviour of the souls of
   the elect may have difficulty understanding these broad concepts.  But
   those who understand that Christ has been given all power on heaven and
   on earth, spiritual and material, will recognise the great drama
   surrounding Christ, the Lion of Judah.  He is the center of that divine
   struggle involving the principles and powers, a struggle that will
   continue until its bitter completion, when Satan will fall from heaven
   like lightning and this world has been released from his grip, while
   God's holy dominion over this world will have been fully established.

               This process, during which the ruler of this world is
   dethroned and the glorious dominion of Christ is established over this
   world, constitutes the red line throughout history.

   [17] The Reformed churches not only lost their superstition, but they
   also lost all sensitivities to that large spiritual world, the reality
   of which Kuyper is arguing so strongly.  A case of the baby being
   thrown out along with the bath water.

   [18] My experiences in Nigeria bear out these assertions as already
   indicated previously.  However, these people not only use magical
   formulas to resist demonic influences, but the sorcerers among them
   also use formulas to harness these influences for their own benefit.

   [19] It would appear here as if Kuyper had a very high and uncritical
   opinion of western culture.  In fact, those acquainted with his
   writings and works know that Kuyper was a tireless champion against the
   secularism and decadence of his culture.  His positive attitude here is
   directed to developments in science.  In his days, people could be
   excused from failing to recognize the negatives associated with science
   and technology today.  See Introduction.

Chapter 9

                            THE WISDOM OF THE WORLD

               We now have before us the full picture with all of its
   relationships.  It is the spiritual that governs the material.  Among
   all the creatures on earth, mankind possesses the strongest spirit.
   God appointed the human race to exercise dominion over the earth and
   all of nature (Gen 1:16-18).  Satan distorted this situation.  His
   spirit being more powerful than that of mankind, he exerted his
   influence over the spirit of our race, led us to the fall, and since
   then has penetrated all of human life and, in fact, all creaturely
   existence and processes.  This cancerous growth resulted in mankind
   losing its dominant position and Satan taking its place.  He pushed
   mankind from the throne of honour and placed himself on it.

               For this reason, Christ Himself bestowed on him the title
   of "ruler of the world."  The first prophecy was directed against this
   "ruler of the world" and predicted that one time the seed of the woman
   would crush Satan's head (Gen. 3:15).  Then came the establishment of
   the nation of Israel that was protected in a special way over against
   the onslaughts of Satan on their own territory.  Finally, Christ
   Himself came.  Christ was both Son of God and Son of Man, but it was as
   Son of Man that He engaged Satan in the struggle to overthrow him as
   the "ruler of the world" and to dethrone him.  The goal was for Him as
   head of the human race to restore to mankind the dominion over the
   earth that was lost because of the fall.  This struggle between the
   divinely anointed King and the "ruler of the world" started with the
   temptation in the wilderness, continued to Gethsemane and Golgotha and
   came to its principal settlement with the resurrection of Christ.

               During Jesus' days on earth, there was tremendous agitation
   in the demonic world.  The country of Israel was full of possessed
   people.  The most hellish intentions possessed a Judas, a high priest,
   a Roman governor.  Over against the power of Satan and his demons,
   Jesus rose up with the superior royal power of the Spirit.  He cast out
   demons and gave His disciples also power over them by means of the
   immediate power of His Spirit.  That was not all.  Since the demonic
   power of the ruler of the world was secretly behind the curse over
   nature and the miseries suffered by the human race, Christ exercised
   His power of the miraculous also over the physical realm.  He not only
   cast out demons, but He also healed the sick and demonstrated the
   superiority of His Spirit over nature.  He did all these directly,
   without resorting to means.  Even the storm on the Sea of Galilee was
   stilled by no more than His word of power.  The climax of it all came
   in His power over death.  He recalled Lazarus from the grave, the
   daughter of Jairus from her deathbed and a young man from his bier.
   This power of the immediate work of the spirit He also laid upon the
   disciples after whom it continued to be exercised throughout the
   apostolic century.

               This was only the beginning and in that beginning came also
   the prophecy of what is awaiting us at the end of the ages.  Christ
   will one day return and then the power of Satan will be completely
   destroyed and a situation better than the original Garden will be
   established.  Then the great miracle will happen, when this earth will
   be transformed into a new earth that will flower eternally before the
   face of God under a new heaven.

               In between the day of Christ's initial principal victory
   and that end time lies a long interim period.  During this interim
   Satan has suffered defeat in principle, but he continues to agitate the
   world, especially the non-Christian peoples.  That is why Jesus
   ascended into heaven, where He now sits at God's right hand with His
   royal dominion and is busy forming in this world even now a new
   humanity that is His body and that derives its life from Him as its
   head.

               This church of the living God has received the Holy Spirit
   in two ways.  She herself derives her life from this Spirit and,
   secondly, she spreads around her a new atmosphere of a higher and
   holier human society.  This is the city on the hill that herself enjoys
   that light not only, but also has that light radiating out into the
   world.  The atmosphere of the Holy Spirit pushes back that of Satan.
   There arose within that atmosphere a Christian approach to statehood,
   society, science and art.  In this atmosphere magic and sorcery could
   not blossom and thus disappeared.  The human spirit has been liberated
   in this atmosphere.  In the sweat of its brow that liberated human
   spirit eats from the bread of knowledge and regains through science
   that power of nature which we have now achieved.

               Alas, all that glitters is not gold.  In place of honouring
   the Christ for this restored power, scientists increasingly regard the
   area of science as if its might is rooted in its own power and pit it
   against the King who restored this power to them.

               Unfortunately, the Christian community shares in the
   responsibility for this unhappy development.  With a narrow minded
   reductionist perspective she recognized only the direct, immediate
   power of the spirit that expresses itself through miracles while she
   closed her eyes to the development of that wider spiritual power over
   nature that was restored to mankind during the interim period in the
   form of inventiveness, utilizing of talents and gifts, and the
   application of serious research.  The Christian community did not
   recognize that wider liberation of the spirit and often regarded
   experimental research with suspicion.  She has often sought to obtain
   via miracles what is available only through the sweat of the brow, that
   is, through hard work.  An extreme example here is the refusal on the
   part of some to avail themselves of modern medicine and the insistence
   that healing come through prayer and miracle alone.  Christians have
   readily appreciated the need for hard work in the area of agriculture,
   but have not always realized that it is required for all human powers
   of both body and spirit.

               The result has been that especially unbelievers have
   applied themselves to this neglected area with the consequence that an
   attitude of hostility to science developed within the Christian
   church.  Here we have the origin of that wide chasm between science and
   faith.  The Christian church withdrew with a sense of helplessness.
   She no longer possessed the power to perform miracles and the power of
   science was left to the unbelievers.  The other side of the coin was
   that scientists tended increasingly to reject the faith and to act as
   if their scholarship rested on purely autonomous human power that was
   pitted against the Kingship of Christ.

               Gradually a change is coming about.  The spiritual Israel,
   the church, is coming out of its tents.  She is beginning to recognize
   her mistake.  She seeks to make a break with her former narrow
   perspective and shedding her reluctance by accepting the advantages of
   the power that has been achieved over nature with gratitude.  She is
   beginning to recover her sensitivity to the work of Christ as King to
   restore the dominion of mankind over the earth.  A new light is
   arising.  Christians are now reaching for the power of scholarship.
   They now realize that the power of Christ is also active in science and
   they now pay tribute to Christ as King in this area as well.

               This new development, however, creates a new danger.  Those
   Christians who reconciled themselves with science then went to the
   other extreme.  Taking their cue only from scientific theories, they
   moved away from the mysteries of creation to replace these with the
   hypothesis of evolution .  We should regard this development as a
   transition situation that victimizes only those afflicted with
   spiritual superficiality.  Solid believers refuse to be caught in this
   trap.  They draw a sharp line between the substantial results of
   science that are the outcome of strict research and those theories
   produced by the imagination of researchers who have gone off the deep
   end.

               In addition to the restored power over nature, it is
   especially the steady increase of our knowledge that heightens our
   sense of human grandeur and that ends up with people elevating
   themselves with creaturely pride, while simultaneously rejecting the
   humility that is characteristic of the Gospel. You many remember the
   earlier discussion where it was observed that the blocking of the
   stream of religious life can be attributed to various factors, among
   them being our power over nature, but also and especially to the
   increase of human knowledge and to the high level that scholarship has
   been achieved in almost every area.  It is therefore necessary to
   determine whether Christianity must in principle resist this high level
   of scholarship and be hostile to it or whether this scholarship is a
   blessing to us from Christ, even though many of its practitioners try
   their best to separate their work from Christ and even play them off
   against each other.

               To begin with, it sometimes does indeed appear as if
   Christianity wants to attack scholarship and ban it altogether.
   Especially the apostle Paul never tired of speaking about the
   foolishness of the wisdom of this world.  "Has not God made foolish the
   wisdom of the world?" he wrote (I Cor. 1:20).  "Philosophy" was
   considered illegitimate.  The church is strengthened not by the noble
   and wise of the world, but by the simple, the foolish, those whom the
   world despises.  Paul rejected the "philosophers of this age."  He
   continued, "For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom
   did not know Him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was
   preached to save those who believe" (I Cor. 1:21).  The Greeks sought
   wisdom.  Christ was not only "a stumbling block to the Jews," but also
   "foolishness to Gentiles," including the Greeks.  In order "to shame
   the wise," God "chose the foolish things for the world."  We are called
   upon not to be taken "captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy,
   which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this
   world" (Col. 2:8).  Jesus Himself had given praise and thanks to God
   that it had pleased God to "have hidden these things from the wise and
   learned, and revealed them to little children" (Mat. 11:25).

               This attack on the "wisdom of the world" is so emphatic and
   so insistent throughout the Scriptures that it should not surprise us
   that those who zeroed in on it and who would ignore the context in
   which these attacks occur, would despise all human scholarship and
   oppose all higher human knowledge.

               This evil and negative development within the church could
   only be stemmed by a healthy proclamation of the Bible, but such
   preaching was sadly lacking.  Theology withdrew to its own area and
   lost its relationship or dialogue with other disciplines.  It paraded
   itself as the grand master whose duty it was to prevent the other
   disciplines from making further progress.  Theologians almost
   completely forgot that which some of the Reformed creeds confess,
   namely, that we know Gold from two books, the book of Scripture and the
   book of nature, the latter of which strongly emphasized the majesty of
   the Lord of Lords.  Theologians were too eager to dominate through
   force, force by the church supported by force by the state.
   Paradoxically, this attitude caused theology to become poor, emaciated,
   petrified and increasingly to find itself in a defensive position vis a
   vis the natural sciences that were blossoming.

               The perspective that developed within the church was wholly
   wrong and completely contrary to the Scriptures.  Nowhere does the
   Scripture insist that we glean all our knowledge about nature and the
   world from the Bible.  The Bible tells us that there are certain things
   that you can learn only from nature and from the world, while there are
   other things for which nature or the world cannot help us at all.  Some
   of those can be learned only from the Bible.  Scripture does not have a
   low regard for knowledge derived from nature.  Instead, we are told
   that from nature we learn about "the glory of God; the skies proclaim
   the work of His hands" (Psalm 19:1). It is an extreme form of
   foolishness to imagine that you can learn from the Bible all you need
   to know about nature and the life of the world, its historical
   progress, etc., without doing any further scientific research in nature
   or the composition of the world.  The human body can only be known by
   investigating it.  The crust of the earth can only be understood by
   digging into it.  Animals can be known only by studying animals; plants
   only by studying plants.  Similarly, the history of the human race can
   only be understood by studying its past.  While we place Scripture in
   the forefront, of course, next to it lie open before us the kingdom of
   nature along with the history of mankind and the development of its
   powers in the various realms, as our legitimate sources of knowledge.
   Those who close the book of nature in order to concentrate on the
   Scripture do not honour God as much as those who conscientiously study
   both the book of Scripture and that of nature.  In nature as well as in
   human life a treasury of knowledge is awaiting us that God Himself
   brings to our attention and which it would be sin to push aside while
   we busy ourselves with reading the Bible.  Yet that is exactly what
   people do all too much, with the result that we have two approaches,
   each as one-sided as the other.  One side is content with the Bible and
   ignores the book of nature, while the other, equally one-sided, pushes
   the Scripture aside and considers the book of nature and of human life
   sufficient.

               The same contrast was common also in the days of the
   apostles.  In that Graeco-Roman culture, people were ignorant of the
   Scripture and sought their salvation in contemporary scholarship.  At
   the same time, the Jews regarded the Old Testament as almost the only
   source of knowledge and they as good as ignored wider scholarship.
   True, there were various schools of thought among the Jews, but these
   were all varieties among those schooled in the Scriptures, all of whom
   concentrated on the explanation of the Old Testament and constructed a
   scholastic series of propositions on that basis.  Then, too, there was
   the contrast between the Scriptures of the Old Testament on the one
   hand and the philosophy, scholarship and wisdom of the Greeks on the
   other.  Since the Gospel showed both the rabbinical study of the Old
   Testament and the wisdom of the Greeks to be insufficient, Paul opposed
   both and concluded that the Gospel cannot but be an affront to the Jews
   and foolishness to the Greeks.

               It was an affront to the Jews, because it pulled down their
   national pride.  The Jews laboured under the illusion that their
   special position in the world was a permanent arrangement.  The Messiah
   whom they were expecting was an earthly king on the throne of David in
   Jerusalem.  Of course, both Christ and the apostles annoyed and angered
   them greatly, for they pulled the rug from under Jewish national pride
   and regarded the Jewish nation merely as a means for the coming of
   salvation.  The Jews were invited to enter the Kingdom of heaven on the
   same basis as the Gentiles.

               Similarly, the Gospel could not but be regarded as folly by
   the learned Greeks.  After all, they considered themselves capable of
   constructing a complete system of knowledge concerning the origin and
   composition of reality on basis of their own independent reasoning.
   They felt insulted when the apostle unmasked their system and had the
   light of divine revelation penetrate into the darkness of their
   paganism.  The wise and learned among the Greeks despised the idol
   worship that was practised by the peasants in the villages and the
   lower classes in the cities.  As cultured, learned and developed men,
   they considered themselves far above such idolatrous nonsense and
   judged it all foolishness.  When the new Christian religion appeared on
   the scene, these learned Greeks regarded it as another variety of the
   paganism of their own people they so despised and quickly applied the
   term "foolishness" to it as well.

               When Paul first heard of this reaction, instead of
   withdrawing with hesitation, he accepted this caricature and turned it
   against them.  The Gospel is not foolish, but their wisdom is!  Through
   your imaginary wisdom, he challenged them, you have closed yourself to
   the Gospel.  But true wisdom is found in that Gospel, for its source is
   not human wisdom, but the wisdom of God Himself.  It pleased God, Paul
   asserted, to close the hearts of both Jewish rabbis and Greek
   philosophers and to recommend to both all that they considered the
   foolishness of the world, the weak, the ignoble, the humble.

               The question now is whether the foolishness that Christ and
   His apostles rejected as the wisdom of the world is identical with
   natural science, the science of history and the rest of modern
   scholarship.  That is the basic question that we must face.  The answer
   to that question is an unqualified "No!"

               In order to understand this issue, we need to clearly
   distinguish between modern science that rests on strict and
   undisciplined research and those systems of knowledge constructed on
   basis of guesses, assumptions and their logical relationships.  The
   results of experimental research are indisputable and must be accepted
   by all, for this approach can demonstrate to us the nature of things.
   Everyone knows that a lightning rod can attract lightning and then
   divert it in order to save the building.  Yet, there are those who
   refuse to install a lightning rod on their house, not because they do
   not understand its operation, but because they are under the religious
   illusion that they may not protect themselves against lightning.  Such
   religious timidity in no way diminishes the truth of well-researched
   facts.  That none of us deny the truth of all these new scientific
   findings is clearly demonstrated by the fact that all of us without
   hesitation make regular use of its technological fruits in our use of
   cars, airplanes and telephones.  In addition, most of us gratefully
   accept the services of a physician to take care of our aches and pains.

               The Greeks in the days of Paul had not yet penetrated
   deeply into either nature or history, though it cannot be denied that
   they had already made some significant discoveries in the realm of
   nature as well as in human anatomy.  They had made remarkable progress
   with respect to certain diseases.  It never occurred to the apostle
   Paul to reject these gains.  In fact, on one of his missionary
   journeys, Luke, the physician, accompanied him.  Nowhere in his letters
   do you find any hint that Paul would have turned against scholarship or
   against the science of nature.  Anyone who thinks to find any such
   sentiment in Paul's writing surely misunderstands him.  Rather, his
   admonition to try all things and to retain the good is directly
   applicable in this area.  Research into nature, history and the
   composition of the world and human life is not only not to be
   condemned, but it is to be encouraged and praised--provided, and this
   is something never to be forgotten, such research leads to retaining
   the true and the good while it leads to rejecting evil.

               It is an important duty of Christians to test all that
   pretends to be scholarship.  Already in those days the scholarship or
   wisdom of the Greeks mixed two different kinds of knowledge.  On the
   one hand, there were the results of strict research and, on the other
   hand, the system of knowledge based on rationalistic guesses and
   assumptions.  It was the result of their rationalistic activity that
   they recommended as their wisdom and their philosophy.  The apostle in
   no way turned against their scientific knowledge; he only rejected the
   fruit of their rationalism.

Chapter 10

                            SCHOLARSHIP AND SCIENCE

               The distinction between the natural sciences and the
   "wisdom of the Greeks" against which the apostle inveighs in his
   letters, is embedded in our languages and terminology.  The French use
   the term "les sciences exactes" to refer to that branch of scholarship
   that concerns itself strictly with the study of nature.  In English,
   these sciences may variously be referred to as the "exact sciences,"
   "natural sciences" or "physical sciences" in distinction from the
   "social sciences."

               This distinction is not meant to belittle the great
   importance of the historical or social sciences, but it is intended to
   emphasize the fact that these are different from the exact sciences
   that depend on strict research into nature.  The unique value of the
   results of natural science is that they are universally valid and
   cannot be called into question.

               Of course, it has happened more than once that people
   announce premature conclusions that may be accepted for years, but
   which eventually are rejected, because they are found to be based on
   either inadequate facts or false generalizations.  Examples of such
   corrections can be pointed out in many areas, especially within the
   medical sciences.  There we have seen more than once how a cure or
   method that was recognized as valid for years is suddenly declared
   inadequate or even false.  Thus, there are good reasons for being
   careful.

               With the above stricture in mind, we have to gratefully
   acknowledge that, by careful observation, the natural sciences have
   discovered facts along with the forces behind these facts.  The
   regularity of natural laws has been observed.  This has given us a sure
   base of knowledge and increased our control over the forces of nature.
   Because of this development, these exact sciences must be attributed a
   high degree of validity.

               The research connected with these exact sciences restricts
   itself to the empirical.  It does not concern itself with the spiritual
   and other areas beyond the empirical.  The subjective element that can
   play such a large role in the historical and spiritual sciences hardly
   appears in these exact sciences.  For this reason, the latter make a
   greater impression on those who possess an atrophied spirit than do
   those sciences that are more closely concerned with faith.  The type of
   difficulties and disagreements that prevent unity and consensus in the
   spiritual area hardly occur in the natural sciences.  In the physical
   sciences, as long as the observations have been reached via accepted
   methods, everyone accepts the conclusions.  There is hardly room for
   any doubt here.  Everyone accepts the new findings and takes them into
   account in their own work.  The scientific method of strict and careful
   observation, the drawing of strictly logical conclusions from these
   observations and the subsequent verification that is part of the method
   provide us with a certainty and stability that erases all doubts from
   our minds.

               We are not suggesting that faith provides less certainty
   than do the exact sciences, but it is certainty of a totally different
   nature.  This certainty is based on the spiritual attitude of the
   researcher that may not be present in others.  Those who possess this
   kind of spiritual certainty may be immovable in their conviction, but
   neither its base nor content can be demonstrated or proven to others,
   except to those who share the same basic faith.  Thus, on the one hand,
   there are the absolute and demonstrable exact sciences; on the other,
   the spiritual sciences, the results of which can be claimed only by
   those who have the required spiritual aptitude.  A researcher who lacks
   the spiritual wherewithal can no more judge or accept the result of
   spiritual research than a blind person can judge colours or a dead
   person, sounds.  This situation has brought it about that the exact
   sciences recommended themselves more and more as the only valid science
   or only valid scholarship and as the only avenue by which we can
   achieve truth.  Science and faith have come to be thought of as
   mutually exclusive opposites.

               Now, as long as scientists concerned themselves only with
   the empirical, and only with truth related to the empirical, that
   approach was acceptable.  But this condition was not met. Scientists
   continually went beyond their own territory to trespass on areas not
   amenable to the exact sciences.  They spent their energies on the
   construction of systems that lacked all certainty.  At the same time,
   those who devoted themselves to the historical, psychological and
   spiritual sciences falsely demanded equal recognition of the kind of
   certainty that is valid in the exact sciences.  Thus great confusion
   arose.  The distinctions between the two types of science were
   ignored.  Both sides insisted on the right to the term "science."
   Theologians and other practitioners of the non-exact sciences began to
   insist proudly that even in their disciplines, scholarship had the
   right to place itself above or over against faith.  They also arrogated
   to themselves the right to determine on the same basis as the physical
   sciences the nature of truth and error.

               Among the greatest of the scholars this problem was not so
   serious, for they tended to be reserved in their judgements.  However,
   among scientists of lower rank this boasting soon went beyond all
   bounds.  This was especially the case with those who did not engage in
   original research of their own, but who reached their conclusions on
   basis of the findings of others.  Examples were unbelievers of the
   second rank among the teaching and journalistic professions.  There
   especially this annoying idolatry of pseudo-science and their
   glorification of the sciences was set in opposition to the faith.  It
   was a matter of course that under these circumstances, those who,
   because of an inner aptitude in their subjective existence, developed a
   higher appreciation for the organ of faith, became critical of all
   attempts to oppose anything spiritual in the name of the honourable,
   high-sounding, but misapplied name of science.

               The situation in the pagan world of Greece and Rome was
   exactly the same at the time the Christian religion made its debut.
   Not one of the apostles has ever with a single word denigrated the
   results already achieved by the exact sciences of their day.  It never
   occurred to them to do so.  There is not the slightest trace of such an
   attitude found in any apostolic writing.

               But the Scripture does attack and expose as wisdom gone
   astray and as pseudo-science the false pretences of "science" advanced
   by pagan thinkers who based their systems of guesses, suspicions and
   assumptions that were based on a rationalistic approach.  The
   legitimate object of the exact sciences is the empirical world.  At
   that level, the sciences are strong and, as long as they restrict
   themselves to that realm and base their findings on careful research,
   they deserve our support, trust, praise and gratitude.  But those
   sciences know nothing about the origin of things, nothing about the
   spirit, nothing about the spiritual world that exists beyond our
   earth.  Neither can they know anything about the way the spiritual can
   affect the material.  The entire spiritual realm, so much higher and
   more complicated than the empirical, escapes the exact sciences and
   lies beyond the reach of their research.  They have nothing to tell us
   about the unity of the design of the course of the history of this
   world.  The destination of mankind after death and eternity are hidden
   from them by an impenetrable veil. Similarly, the moral struggle
   between the holy and the unholy, the origin of that struggle, or what
   the end of that struggle will be are all issues that completely escape
   the exact sciences.  These sciences can tell you nothing about divine
   providence by which God governs all.  When it comes to the highest of
   all, the religious and the holy Object of our worship, these sciences
   are totally mute.  There it behooves their practitioners to confess
   complete ignorance, if they want to be honest.

               This point was difficult for the men of science to
   concede.  They did sense clearly that all these spiritual concerns were
   of much greater importance for the inner life of people than those
   concerning the empirical world about which they had so much certain
   knowledge.  For this reason they could not get themselves to confess
   their ignorance of this most important realm.  As a result, they
   asserted their right to make high sounding declarations also in the
   spiritual realm.  Using fantasy and incredible mental gymnastics, they
   advanced all kinds of fanciful notions concerning various spiritual
   issues and based it all on guesses and assumptions.  Then they would
   offer the results of their system as the real truth, the real wisdom,
   the real science and the real philosophy, even though it lacked any
   kind of foundation.

               The fragile nature of these constructions and their lack of
   trustworthiness was demonstrated by the sober fact that philosopher
   after philosopher would demolish the approaches of all his predecessors
   and seek to replace them with his own.  Thus arose one school of though
   after another, each always opposing all the others.  Each approach was
   based on a different world and life view.  Through these false
   constructions they smothered the true thirst after God in the human
   heart and encouraged the spirit of haughtiness, sensuality and eternal
   doubt.  The end result of it all was that, with all this puffed-up type
   of "wisdom," the finest impulses of the human heart withered away and
   the soul could find no peace in its unceasing search.

               Then the Christian faith arrived on the scene.  It aimed at
   the renewal of the impulses of the human heart unto a new life and to
   offer the heart, tired by the endless swings of the pendulum of the
   soul, a new peace from above that surpasses all understanding.  The
   Christian faith by its very nature could not but sharply and
   principally resist all this imaginary "wisdom" that led people away
   from God, in order to disrupt it, expose its empty claims and expel it
   from the human spirit to make room for a Christian disposition.

               It would be wrong to conclude from all this that the
   Christian faith adopted a hostile attitude towards true scholarship.
   In order to sweep away the barriers to the human heart, the Christian
   faith sought to demolish false scholarship that was promoted on a
   completely erroneous foundation.  The situation of that time was
   similar to that of ours.  We, too, enthusiastically embrace genuine
   scholarship and science, but we also insist that proper lines be drawn
   and limits be observed.  Anytime we meet systems that are based on mere
   hunches and weak assumptions and that pretend to explain or even
   explain away spiritual phenomena about which nothing can be known apart
   from faith, we will deny them the right to the title of "scholarship"
   or "science."  Over against them, we will proclaim that Christian world
   and life view that is based solidly on God's revelation.

               You really cannot know anything about Australia, unless
   either you yourself visit the country or someone who has lived there
   tells you about it.  So it is with respect to the invisible world.  We
   will not know what that world is like until either we get there or
   someone who has been there comes down to us to tell us about it.  Until
   that happens, we know nothing about it.  It is almost impossible to
   know anything about what goes on in the inner life of the spiritual
   world.  The apostle Paul was correct in his observation that no one
   knows a person's thoughts, except the spirit within that person (I Cor.
   2:11).  Every personality is such a wonderful mystery to us that even a
   lifetime is too short to get to know just one other person well.

               Gladstone was a great British statesman.  Outside, at his
   front door, this great man hung a cage with a bird in it.  Though that
   bird saw Gladstone come and go many times a day, it could never fathom
   or understand what went on in its master's head.  Left to our own
   devices, we are a little like that bird when it comes to our knowledge
   of God.

               Thank God that it is not quite like that.  Humanity,
   created after God's image, has been equipped with a religious
   sensitivity and with the capability to serve God.  It is entirely
   fitting, therefore, that God has not left us to wander about in
   darkness, but has radiated us with the light of revelation and thus
   allows people to know Him.  That revelation is Christ, He who was in
   heaven but then came down to us.  He attained to the highest perfection
   possible in this sinful world.  He has been able to provide us with
   knowledge of the spiritual realm, about God's greatness, the origin of
   things, the government of this world, our inner soul life, our calling,
   our destination and our own future.  Wherever this revelation of Christ
   entered the world and the Christian faith penetrated paganism, the
   latter collapsed and its imaginative but rationalistic wisdom with
   which contemporary scholars entertained themselves, along with it.  It
   was the little people of the world, the simple and the weak who first
   took hold of this glorious revelation.  However, subsequently the
   higher classes followed and, after a fearful and hard struggle, the
   power of this revelation and the Christian faith triumphed over the
   highly developed wisdom of the Greeks.

               In the early stage of the Christian faith, a certain
   tendency arose to withdraw into the area of revelation and to
   underestimate the significance of the exact sciences.  That was to be
   expected. At the time, the exact sciences had not yet been designated
   their own territory.  In every way they were mixed up with and absorbed
   into what was popularly referred to as "wisdom," as a system, as a
   world and life view.  Because of this, all that went by the name of
   science at the time adopted a sharply hostile attitude over against the
   Christian religion.  It was only natural that Christians would
   therefore first concentrate on defending their faith against this
   intellectualistic attack.  This struggle coincided with the tremendous
   convulsions that led to the collapse of that culture and that destroyed
   the high civilization of the Greco-Roman world.  The stream of the
   Christian religion flowed on into Middle and Western Europe, where
   primitive civilization still held forth. In this new and strange world
   everything had to be built anew.

               During the initial period of the re-birth of these newly
   converted tribes no one even gave any thought to the development of
   scholarship and science.  But the initial period was hardly over when
   scholarship was taken up again, so that before long universities began
   to appear.  The time was now ripe for renewed interest in study and the
   day that the exact sciences would take new roots was near.

               For example, it is significant that during the Reformation,
   the Dutch government, as one of its first acts, established the Academy
   of Leiden.  If you compare the accomplishments of European
   universities, beginning back in the 16^th century, with the results of
   the pagan academies of Athens and Alexandria or with those of the
   Muslim universities of Cairo or Baghdad or Timbuktu, or with the Jewish
   schools at Tiberias and elsewhere, it cannot be denied that scholarship
   and science have come to their powerful bloom and development more
   among Christians than anywhere else.  Though the proof was no longer
   needed, the establishment of the Calvinistic university in Amsterdam,
   the Free Reformed University, demonstrated once again how especially
   Calvinism has such high appreciation for scholarship and science.
   Those who are aware of the developments among Roman Catholics cannot
   deny that amongst them, also, scholarship has blossomed.

               Proof based on history alone is not sufficient.  We need to
   go back to Christ and the Scriptures.  You can ask, for example, what
   connection there could possibly be between the plant kingdom and
   Christ.  The answer to this and similar questions is that Christ is the
   eternal Word.  Through that eternal Word all things, including the
   kingdoms of plants and animals, have been created.  The eternal
   thoughts of God that have found their embodiment in all of
   creation--and thus also in the kingdoms of plants and animals--have
   come to their embodiment only through the eternal Word.  There is not a
   single flower or single chirping bird that does not represent something
   of this eternal Word that has its mark placed upon all creatures. The
   Scriptures do not lock Christ up in the kingdom of grace or even in the
   world of mankind.

               The Scriptures show that the entire creation, the visible
   as well as the invisible, depend directly on Christ.  Already in the
   Old Testament, wisdom is glorified as existing from eternity with God.
   It is not the discovery of the human race.  In Proverbs 8:23-27, wisdom
   is shown to come from God:

   I was appointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the world
   began.  When there were no oceans, I was given birth; where there were
   no springs abounding with water; before He made the earth or its field
   or any of the dust of the world, I was there when He set the heavens in
   place, when He marked out the horizon on the face of the deep.


               The Son is not to be excluded from anything.  You cannot
   point to any natural realm or star or comet or even descend into the
   depth of the earth, but it is related to Christ, not in some
   unimportant tangential way, but directly.  There is no force in nature,
   no laws that control those forces that do not have their origin in that
   eternal Word.  For this reason, it is totally false to restrict Christ
   to spiritual affairs and to assert that there is no point of contact
   between Him and the natural sciences.  Rather, every deeper penetration
   into nature must lead to the greater glory of the majesty of the
   eternal Word.

               This is not an unnatural, forced combination.  The apostle
   said it loud and clear when he explained that in Christ "are hidden all
   the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Col. 2:3).  Note well that Paul
   spoke not only of wisdom, but also of knowledge, and not merely some
   knowledge, but "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" are hidden
   in Him.  How could it be otherwise?  He it is through whom all things
   have been created.  He it is who gave embodiment to God's thoughts as
   they are expressed in all creatures, both high and low.  He it is who
   embedded in all creatures the forces, laws and functions that have made
   them what they are.  That being the case, how can anyone possibly think
   of anything whether material or spiritual, as having no relationship to
   Him?  How could anything in all of creation exist without His having
   brought it into operation?  It is not only that He knows and fathoms
   all of nature, but He Himself has purposefully established all there
   is.  Compared to the knowledge of nature that Christ has by virtue of
   His having created it, what is the knowledge that Linnaeus [20] or any
   other scientist has about plants?  All science, whether it concerns
   nature, psychology, ethnology, or any other discipline, is a radiation,
   reflection of a new glory that was hidden, but that is now revealed in
   Christ.  The tremendous increase in knowledge gained during the last
   century is used by those whose spirituality is atrophied and who are
   proud of their own wisdom, to deprive believers of their faith.  But
   we, Christians, accept all new knowledge of nature with thanksgiving,
   because we recognize that through it shines the holy mark of its
   Source.  We know that what we now see is a mere shadow of "all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge" presently hidden in Him.
