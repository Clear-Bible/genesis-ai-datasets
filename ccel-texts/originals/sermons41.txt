Love's Climax

   (No. 2394)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 6, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 10, 1887.

   "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent
   His Son to be the propitiation for our sins." 1 John 4:10.

   To find love, you have need send a lover--one whose soul is full of
   love is the most likely to discover it. John, with love in his heart,
   soars aloft and, using his eagle eyes, looks over all history and all
   space and, at last, he poises himself over one spot, for he has found
   that for which he was looking, and says, "Herein is love." There is
   love in a thousand places, like the scattered drops of spray on the
   leaves of the forest, but as for the ocean, that is in one place, and
   when we reach it, we say, "Herein is water." There is love in many
   places, like wandering beams of light, but as for the sun, it is in one
   part of the heavens and as we look at it, we say, "Herein is light."
   So, "Herein," said the Apostle, as he looked toward the Lord Jehovah,
   Himself, "Herein is love." He did not point to his own heart and say,
   "Herein is love," for that was but a little pool filled from the great
   sea of love. He did not look at the Church of God and say of all the
   myriads who counted not their lives dear unto them, "Herein is love,"
   for their love was only the reflected brightness of the great sun of
   love! No, he looked to God the Father, in the splendor of His
   condescension in giving His only Son to die for us, and he said "Herein
   is love," as if all love were here--love at its utmost height, love at
   its climax, love out-doing itself-- "Herein is love, not that we loved
   God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for
   our sins."

   I have no time for an elaborate discourse and I have no desire to
   preach in such a fashion, but I do want to get at your hearts by the
   power of the Holy Spirit. There seem to me to be four things in the
   text, each of which tends to bring out the greatness of Divine Love.
   First, here is love to the loveless--"Herein is love, not that we loved
   God, but that He loved us." Secondly, here is love to the sinful--"God
   loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
   Thirdly, here is love providing a propitiation, not passing by sin
   without atonement, but making a propitiation for sin. And, lastly, here
   is love surrendering the Only-Begotten--"God loved us, and sent His Son
   to be the propitiation for our sins."

   I. First, then, dear Friends, that we may see the love of God in its
   fullness, I invite you to think of His LOVE TO THE LOVELESS--"Herein is
   love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us."

   Now, if man had loved God, God need not have loved man. If all of us
   from our earliest childhood had loved our God, it would have somewhat
   lessened the wonder that He should love us. I can understand that we
   should marvel at God's loving us, even if we had always loved Him, for
   we are so insignificant that what little love we can give to Him can
   never deserve that He should fix His heart of love upon us. If an ant
   were in love with an angel, it would not, therefore, follow that the
   angel ought to be in love with the ant, yet there is no difference
   between an ant and an angel compared with the difference between us and
   God! We are nothing and He is All in All!

   Yet I admit that if, from our youth up we had always loved God, it
   would not have seemed so extraordinary a thing, knowing what we do of
   God, that He should have loved us, but this is the startling word in
   our text--"Not that we loved God." There is a negative put there and
   the positive assertion is that God did love us, even though there is
   also the negative that we did not love Him. It is very easy for us to
   love those who love us. It is hard, sometimes, to love those who do not
   love us, especially if they are under great obligation to us--and I am
   sure that was our case with regard to God. We were deeply in debt to
   Him and we ought to have loved Him with all our heart, mind, soul and
   strength--but we did nothing of the kind! Yet, notwithstanding all
   that, He loved us. While we were His enemies, He loved us and sent His
   Son to save us.

   Furthermore, let me remark that, when man does love God, it is no very
   great wonder. If you and I love God--and I hope that we do--if we love
   Him with all the fervor of which our hearts are capable, is there
   anything, after all, very extraordinary in such affection? Why,
   Brothers and Sisters, not to love the Lord our God is detestable! To
   love Him is, in one sense, commendable, but it can never be considered
   meritorious! Who can help loving a kind father who has cared for him
   all his days? Who can help loving one who has saved him from death? Who
   can help loving one who has laid down his life for him? Surely, if we
   are in a right state of heart, we cannot help loving God because He
   first loved us. When we do love Him, it is not at all wonderful--it
   would be little enough return for the great love wherewith He has loved
   us if we gave to Him all the love that we can ever bestow upon anyone--

   "Were the whole realm of nature mine, That were a present far too
   small! Love so amazing, so Divine, Demands my soul, my life, my all!'"
   And, if God's love gets all that it demands, it is even then but a poor
   return that we have made for love so magnificent as

   His!

   But, Beloved, I have been only supposing something which is not true,
   for I have been supposing that we loved God. The fact is otherwise,
   according to the text, for the Apostle says, "Not that we loved God."
   Let us think a little of that terrible fact! I do not want to preach to
   you, but I do wish you to preach to yourselves, or rather, that the
   Holy Spirit may preach to you from this passage--"Not that we loved
   God." For many a year we were indifferent to God. He came across our
   path in many ways, but we did not want to see Him, or to hear about
   Him. Some of us were favored by godly training, yet we did our best to
   miss the blessing of it. We tried, as men say, to "sow our wild oats."
   We did not care to do what God would have us do--we were totally
   indifferent to His claims! Yet now, with tears in our eyes, we can
   truthfully say that, "He loved us." We know that the Lord loved us even
   when we were indifferent to Him!

   Worse than that, there were some who were even insulting to God. I mean
   that they spoke ill words about Him and about His Grace, His day, His
   people, His cause, His Word. Some spoke exceedingly proud and exalted
   themselves against the Lord--yet He loved them. Oh, how it wrings the
   heart of a penitent sinner to think that God loved him when he was a
   blasphemer, loved him when he imprecated a curse upon himself, loved
   him when God, Himself, could not see anything in him that was lovable!
   Loved him when there was not a spot of merit as big as a pin's head
   upon which love could have rested if it had needed to rest on merit at
   all! Oh, wonder of wonders! "Herein is love, not that we loved God,"
   but that we were indifferent to Him and some even insulting to Him!

   And oh, what rebellion against God there was in some of our hearts! How
   we kicked and struggled against the idea of yielding to Him! Are there
   not numbers of you who never think of God at all? You go to your daily
   work, or to your business and God is not at all in your thoughts! If
   there were no God, it would make no difference to some of you, except
   that you would feel a little more comfortable and you would then be
   glad that there would be no Judgment Day. But, O Sirs, this is a sad, a
   miserable state to be in! If there were no hereafter and I had to die
   like a dog, I would choose to love my God, for I find a peace, a
   strength, a joy in it that makes life worth living! There is nothing
   here on earth that is worth a man's pursuit except his God! If he once
   knew the love of God, life would wear sunbeams about it--but apart from
   that it is a drudgery! To the unbeliever, existence in this world is a
   horrible slavery.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, it is very wonderful that God should love us
   when we try our hardest to be rid of Him, when we are at enmity against
   Him, when we are opposed, even, to His love, and will not listen to the
   Gospel of His Grace! Yet so He did--He loved us even in this condition!
   Perhaps some of you do not feel that there is anything very remarkable
   in this love of the Lord to the loveless. I should like you to try, if
   you could, love somebody who has nothing about him that is at all
   lovable. I hope, dear Christian people, that you do this, but if you
   learn to love the wicked, the ungodly, the injurious, the deceivers--if
   you even love those who vilify you, those who slander you every day,
   those who despise you and deride you and those who are ungrateful to
   you--if you do this, then you will get into some sort of sympathy with
   God and you will begin to understand a little of what His great love
   must be!

   But there are some men who will never know what such an experience as
   that is until God's Grace renews them, for if anybody says half a word
   against them, their fist is soon in his eye! If anyone does them the
   slightest injury, they will remember it and resent it as long as they
   live! Yes, and I am afraid that there are some who call themselves
   Christians who are of this spirit, and will not forgive. I heard of a
   man who was driving an omnibus and who was beating one of the horses,
   but he never hit the other. Someone on the box said to him, "Why don't
   you whip the other horse?" "Oh," he answered, "I never touch him, for
   if I did, when I put him up at night, he would kick me like a
   Christian." When I heard that, I supposed that there must be some
   so-called Christians who know how to kick when they get a cut of the
   whip-- and I am afraid that there are. But, if you can forgive to 70
   times seven and still continue to forgive, even then you have only done
   what you ought to do, for this is what the Lord Jesus commanded His
   disciples to do--and this is what God did, though He was under no
   obligation to do anything of the kind! Instead of bearing any
   resentment, He was full of Almighty Love. And there are some here,
   tonight, who, as they remember the years in which they lived without
   loving God, must feel that, "herein is love, not that we loved God, but
   that He loved us."

   II. But now, secondly, it greatly enhances the love of God that it is
   LOVE TO THE SINFUL. Remember that all sins are offenses against God.
   Yet it is clear from our text that the Lord loves those who have
   offended Him. There are multitudes who have lived a life full of
   opposition to God, yet He has loved them all the while and saved them
   after all!

   Remember, too, that God has a very keen appreciation of what sin is. It
   shocks Him, it disgusts Him--He cannot bear it. He calls it, "this
   abominable thing which I hate." You and I are often callous to sin, but
   God abhors it. His holy soul is stirred to indignation against it. Yet,
   notwithstanding that--

   "God loved the world of sinners lost And ruined by the Fall"

   and sent His Son into the world to deliver men from sin, the sin which
   He loathed and hated, for He determined to save them from the sin,
   itself, and from all its terrible results! Well might the hymn-writer I
   just quoted go on to sing--

   "Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love, The love of God to me! It brought
   my Sa vior from abo ve, To die on Calvary."

   Do not forget, also, that many sins are committed specially against
   God's Love. That is to say, there are some who even dare to sin the
   more because God is merciful! There are, no doubt, many who have become
   hardened in their lives of sin--though it is a shocking thing that it
   should be so--by the very fact that they believe God is ready to
   forgive them. If such is the condition of your hearts, my Hearers, let
   me assure you that it has also been the case with many others and yet,
   notwithstanding such an enormity of guilt, they have been saved from
   their sins. Verily, "herein is love."

   In the case of some persons, these sins have been persisted in and
   aggravated. There are many whom God has loved with an everlasting love
   and whom Christ has redeemed with His precious blood, who have lived
   twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy years up to their necks in
   sin--and that against light and knowledge! Some have gone on sinning
   with a high hand more and more, yet Almighty Love has come in and saved
   even them! Never let it be thought that any sinner is beyond the reach
   of Divine Mercy so long as he is in the land of the living. I stand
   here to preach illimitable love, unbounded Grace to the vilest of the
   vile, to those who have nothing in them that can deserve consideration
   from God-- men who ought to be swept into the bottomless pit at once if
   Justice meted out to them their just deserts! Even such sinners as
   these, in multitudes of instances, have been washed and made clean
   through the blood of Jesus Christ! "Herein is love."

   I do not see how God ever could have shown His love to the same extent
   as it is now displayed if there had never been any sin in the world. I
   would not dare to say, as Augustine boldly did concerning Adam's sin,
   "Beata culpa!"--"Happy fault!"--because it gave an opportunity for
   Divine Love to prove itself to an extraordinary degree! But I will say
   this-- if God had made ten thousand worlds and lit them up with all His
   wisdom and power, I do not see how He could have manifested His
   matchless love, even then, as He displays it now in the fact that He
   has loved sinful men and women--and loved them so as to make them His
   sons and daughters and bring them to dwell with Him at His right hand
   through Jesus Christ His Son!--

   "He ga ve His Son, His only Son, To ransom rebel worms! 'Tis here He
   makes His goodness known In its most Divine forms."

   I have spoken to you, therefore, of two things that enhance God's
   love--love to the loveless, and love to the sinful. I wish that some
   poor soul could creep in through the door of God's Mercy to which I
   have pointed and get a part and lot in these precious matters!

   III. But now, thirdly, one of the things that make God's love seem very
   wonderful is that it is LOVE PROVIDING A

   PROPITIATION.

   I have heard it asked, "Why did not God just wipe out human sin, and
   say to the guilty, 'There, there, you have done wrong, but I have
   forgiven you'"? Now, if He had done that, what inference would you have
   drawn from such action on His part? Certainly you would not have been
   able to say, "Herein is love," in the sense in which you can now say
   it.

   If the Lord had thus passed by sin, sin would have seemed little, and
   Divine Love little. Many would have said, "Oh, well, sin was nothing
   very great after all. It was an offense against God--He blotted it
   out--and there is an end of it!" Is not everybody here quite certain
   that we would have spoken like that? We would have concluded that sin
   was a very trivial matter, nothing to worry about, or God would not
   have passed it by so readily. But, look--it was such an awful evil that
   He could not pass it by. In His Wisdom, whose judgment is Infallible,
   sin was not pardonable except through a propitiatory Sacrifice! It was
   not possible that offenses against The Divine Majesty should be wiped
   out without expiation! God was the best judge of that question and now,
   when He says, "There must be a propitiation, but I will provide it;
   there must be an Atonement, but I will arrange it"--"Herein is
   love"--love seen at a greater height than it could have been seen in
   any other way!

   Besides, dear Friends, by any other method of removing sin, love would
   not have been seen so majestic over all other attributes. Suppose that
   the Lord had simply said, "Well, though these people have offended, I
   forgive them and there is an end of the quarrel"? Then there could not
   have been exhibited that wondrous sight which we now see! In the death
   of Christ, the Great Propitiation, we see Divine Wisdom planning the
   way, exercising itself to the fullest to devise a method by which God
   might be just and yet, "the Justifier of him which believes in Jesus."
   Then we see Divine Justice coming in fully satisfied by the death of
   Christ and bowing a glad assent to the pardon of the sinner--who is as
   justly forgiven as he would, on the other hand, have been righteously
   punished! In the vicarious Atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ, we see
   all the attributes of God sitting at the feet of Love--all looking up
   and saying to Love--"We will do your bidding, we will, all of us,
   co-act and co-work till the whole Godhead shall be seen exerting its
   Omniscience and putting forth its Omnipotence, in order that there
   might be a propitiation for sin." "Herein is love."

   Again, I do not see, dear Friends, if God had pardoned us without
   expiation, how we ever could have felt the security of love that we now
   feel. I feel at this moment--I do not know how every Believer, here,
   feels-- but I feel that I am absolutely safe! I am a sinner, but there
   is no reason on earth, or under the earth, or in Heaven, itself, why I
   should be sent to Hell. My sin has been forgiven me, but, what is much
   more than that, my Lord Jesus Christ has made such a complete Atonement
   for all my guilt that it does not even exist as a charge against me!
   The debt is paid and the receipt is nailed to His cross--and this gives
   me such a perfect peace, such an absolute rest--I do not think I could
   have had if I had merely read in the Scriptures that God had passed by
   the sin without a propitiation! He has not passed by the sin--He has
   exacted the full penalty for it! And the penalty having been paid, the
   Atonement having been offered, who shall lay anything to the charge of
   God's elect? Our dead sins are buried! Christ, Himself, has put them
   away, and they can never rise against us in judgment any more. Looking
   up to our Lord, we can say, with Toplady--

   "Complete Atonement You have made, And to the utmost farthing paid
   Whatever Your people owed! Nor can His wrath on me take place, If
   sheltered in Your righteousness, And sprinkled with Your blood." And
   once more, the stoop of love could never have seemed so great without
   expiation, for, see, if God had pardoned sin without Atonement, He
   would have sat in the serene majesty of Heaven and we would have
   thought that sin was a trifling thing, altogether beneath His notice!
   But now, He that made all things and by whom all things consist, takes
   off the robes of His splendor and comes down to earth! What can He be
   going to do? Blessed spirits, who have waited around His Throne for
   ages, what is He doing? He is going to the earth to unite the nature of
   fallen humanity with His own perfect Deity! He that is God is also to
   be Man! What a wonder! What a marvel! But there is something more
   extraordinary to follow--being found in fashion as a Man, the time
   comes when man's sin is laid upon Him! What? did He bear sin?
   Listen--"Who His own self"--that is, Christ, whom angels worship, the
   Incarnate Wisdom, without whom was not anything made that was
   made--"who His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree."
   "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse
   for us: for it is written, Cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree."

   Why, do you know, sometimes, when I am thinking over this wondrous
   stoop of love, I wish that I could jump into this pulpit, directly, and
   tell you what I feel about it? Sometimes, at the dead of night, I sit
   up in bed, lost in wonder at the amazing Love of God in the gift of His
   dear Son! That I should commit a sin and that God, Himself, should bear
   its punishment! That my guilt should make a propitiation,
   necessary--and that the Divine Son of God should suffer in my place!
   That the necessary expiation should be made--this is surely the
   greatest wonder of earth or Heaven! It is the greatest marvel that ever
   shall be, that He, who is God over all, blessed forever, yet stoops so
   low as this! I can understand His stooping to poverty and being a
   carpenter. I can understand His stooping to hunger and to thirst. I can
   understand His stooping even to death--but that He should bear our
   sins--this is the greatest stoop of all! "Herein is love." O blessed
   Lord Jesus, how must You have loved us when You did not disdain to bear
   even the enormous burden of our sin! Oh, that these lips had language
   that I could tell this old, old story as my heart often tells it to
   herself! But I must leave each one of you to think it over, under the
   teaching of the Holy Spirit, till you, also, feel, "Herein is love,"

   IV. The last thing on which I am to speak at this time is LOVE
   SURRENDERING THE ONLY-BEGOTTEN.

   I have shown you wherein God's Love excels all other loves--it is love
   to the loveless, love to the sinful, love providing a propitiation. Now
   here is the climax of the love of God in giving up His only-begotten
   Son--"He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our
   sins."

   You do not need for me to say much about this part of our subject. Will
   you kindly recall the story of Abraham and his son Isaac going to the
   mount in the land of Moriah? Put the Lord God and His well-beloved Son,
   our Lord Jesus Christ, in the place of the Patriarch and his son, and
   you can see the picture of the Atonement drawn to the life before your
   eyes. You remember how the Lord said to Abraham, "Take now your son,
   your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of
   Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the
   mountains which I will tell you of."

   Jesus was God's Son, His only-begotten Son, whom He loved more than any
   of you can ever love your sons or daughters, for the love of God
   towards Him is ineffable, immeasurable! It is not possible for me to
   tell you how much God loved His Son. But that Son who had always given
   Him delight, in whom He was well-pleased--that Son must endure shame,
   agony and death if sinners were ever to be saved! How could the Father
   give up His Son for such a purpose? I have sometimes felt as if I could
   almost rush in, and say, "No! It must not be! The price is too great to
   be paid for the rescue of such worthless worms as we are!" Yet, to
   ransom any one of us, the Son of God must be sacrificed and sacrificed,
   as it were, by His Father, for thus is it written, "It pleased the Lord
   to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief." Thus, there is one point of
   resemblance between the offering of Isaac and the propitiatory
   Sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ--it was the Father who had to offer
   up His son whom He loved so dearly. But there are many more
   similarities between these two offerings.

   In the 22nd chapter of the Book of Genesis, we read that, "Abraham rose
   up early in the morning." God also rose early to make this great
   propitiation for our sins. In the Everlasting Covenant, before the
   earth was, He ordained the Sacrifice which should tear His heart. God
   Himself had done as Abraham did when he cut the wood for the burnt
   offering, that is, the Lord prepared everything for the coming, the
   life and the death of His Son. All that went before in the arrangements
   of Providence was like the chopping of the wood and the laying of it in
   order--even from eternity the great Father contemplated the Sacrifice
   on Calvary and went on with all that was necessary for its completion.

   Then there was the lifting of the sacrificial knife--"Abraham stretched
   forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son." That lifting of
   the knife in the case of Jesus was, first, when in Gethsemane's garden,
   the Father permitted His Son to sweat, as it were, great drops of
   blood. And next, when on the Cross He allowed Him to say, "My God, My
   God, why have You forsaken Me?" This was the knife for the sacrificing
   of the Son. Then came the crushing of our Redeemer's soul beneath the
   mass of human sin. The great upper and nether millstones of Almighty
   Wrath pressed and bruised the heart of the Son of God! Omnipotence put
   forth all its power to deal out the vengeance due to sin! It cried to
   Justice to be stern, sterner than ever--"Awake, O sword." Not, "Let Me
   use the sword," but, "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against
   the Man that is my Fellow, says the Lord of Hosts." And into the very
   dust of death the well-beloved Son of God was crushed!

   Remember, also, that touching little sentence about Abraham and
   Isaac--"They went both of them together." This was true of Jesus and
   His Father--Jesus a willing Sacrifice--and God as willingly
   surrendering His dear Son for our sakes. Never forget the Father's love
   in giving up His Son! It used to be laid down in theology that God "has
   no feeling, neither parts nor passions." Others may worship a dead,
   unfeeling God, if they will, but I do not! The God whom I worship can
   feel far more than any of His creatures can! And what He felt when He
   gave up His Son to die, it is not for human lips to tell. This is among
   the things which it were unlawful and impossible for a man to utter.
   Just what you would have felt if you had given your only son. Just what
   you would have felt if you had been Abraham and you had offered up your
   beloved Isaac. Just that--multiplied by infinity--did the Eternal
   Father feel when He gave His Son to be the propitiation for our sins!
   "Herein is love." Rightly did we sing just now--

   "O love of God, how strong and true! Eternal, and yet always new,
   Uncomprehended and unbought, Beyond all knowledge and all thought. We
   read You best in Him who came To bear for us the Cross of shame; Sent
   by the Father from on high, Our life to live, our death to die." When
   you get home, sit down, say nothing to anybody, but just try, if you
   can, to realize that God actually did give up His only-begotten Son
   that you might live through Him, if you are a Believer in that dear Son
   of God and you live through Him! If He bore your griefs and carried
   your sorrows. If He was wounded for your transgressions and bruised for
   your iniquities. If He put away all your sins, then fall down at His
   dear feet and weep yourself away. No, rise and sing yourself away! And
   when you have done that, come back, again, and go forth to work for Him
   with all your might--and try to love your fellow men at something like
   the rate at which God loved you! You will never reach that climax of
   love, but aim at getting as near to it as you can--and God bless you in
   the effort!

   It seems to me so sad that there should be anybody in the world who
   does not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. And very sad that there
   should be any poor sinner, here, who does not lay hold on eternal life
   as it is set forth in the Gospel. You self-righteous people, you who
   never did any wrong, I do not expect you to take any notice of this
   discourse--you are so wretchedly wrapped up in yourselves that you care
   nothing for my blessed Master! You are like the self-made man, of whom
   I have heard, who used to adore his own maker--his maker being himself.

   But you who are poor and needy, burdened with sin and full of guilt,
   this is the God for you! This is the Christ for you! Come and have Him,
   come and trust Him and then sing with all of us who have believed in
   Him--"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and
   sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins!" May His blessing
   rest on you all, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 JOHN 4; PHILIPPIANS 4:1-9.

   1 John 4:1. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
   whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into
   the world. If John had need to say that in the early morning of
   Christianity, I am sure we ought to say it with greater emphasis today!
   It is certainly true in these days that, "many false prophets are gone
   out into the world." Therefore we, also, must, "try the spirits whether
   they are of God."

   2. Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that
   Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. If the doctrine of the
   Incarnation of God in Christ is denied, as it was by the first
   heretics, we may conclude that the Spirit of God is not in such
   teaching. Any doctrine which dishonors Christ--whether in His Person,
   or His offices, or His Atonement, or in any other way--you may at once
   conclude is not of God, for that which comes from the Spirit of God
   glorifies Christ. Did not our Lord, Himself, say, concerning the Holy
   Spirit, "He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Mine, and shall
   show it unto you"?

   3. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the
   flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you
   have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the
   world. The devil is up early at his evil work! We may sleep, but he
   never does. This is that spirit of antichrist, whereof, "you have heard
   that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."

   4. You are of God, little children, and have overcome them. How? By
   argument? No, but--

   4. Because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.
   If God's own Spirit is in you, you need not fear any of these enemies.
   "Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world." If it
   were a conflict between you and others who had the Spirit of God within
   them, the conflict would be grievous and the issue of it would be
   doubtful. But now that the struggle is between the Spirit of God who is
   in you and the spirit of error that is in the world, you need have no
   question about the ultimate result of the battle!

   5, 6. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
   world hears them. We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is
   not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the
   spirit of error. If Apostolic teaching is denied, those who deny it are
   not of God, for the Spirit of God was in the Apostles, as He is also in
   all the Lord's true children. By this test we may try many of the
   spirits of the present day--"He that knows God hears us; He that is not
   of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit
   of error." The Apostle now gives us another Infallible test by which we
   may "try the spirits."

   7, 8. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and
   everyone that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not
   knows not God; for God is Love. Where there is the spirit of enmity, of
   envy, of pride, of contention, there is not the Spirit of God! That
   which makes towards love, we may depend upon it--it came forth from
   love! But that which makes towards division, contention, emulation and
   strife, is not of God, "for God is Love."

   9-12. In this was manifested the Love of God toward us, because that
   God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, that some might live
   through Him. Herein is love, not that we loved God but that He loved
   us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if
   God so loved us, we ought, also, to love one another. No man has seen
   God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and His love
   is perfected in us. We cannot see God, but we can love God, and love,
   therefore, takes the place of eyes to us. When we love God, it is
   because He dwells in us! That is better than seeing Him--to have Him
   resident within our spirit, although He is not discernible by these
   mortal eyes!

   13-16. Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He
   has given us of His Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the
   Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. Whoever shall
   confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in Him, and he in God.
   And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is
   Love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him. These
   words are very simple, but the lesson they convey is a very deep one.
   Most of them are monosyllables, but, oh, what marvels of meaning the
   Holy Spirit enabled the Apostle John to put into them!

   17, 18. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
   the day ofjudgment: because as He is, so are we in this world. There is
   no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear has
   torment. That is a servile fear, of course, but there is a fear which
   has no torment in it--that holy fear which even angels feel when they
   veil their faces in the Presence of the Most high. There is no torment
   in that reverent awe and, the more we have of love towards God, the
   more of that filial fear shall we have! But that slavish dread, that
   awful terror which begets within itself dislike, cannot live where true
   love is planted within the soul--

   "Perfect love casts out fear."

   18-20. He that fears is not made perfect in love. We love Him, because
   He first loved us. If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he
   is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can
   he love God, whom he has not seen? God looked upon us with an eye that
   saw all our sin and misery, yet He loved us, and He wants us to have a
   love which, while it sees all the imperfection and all the faults in
   our fellow men, yet loves them notwithstanding all. If we do not love
   those whom we see, the Apostle says that we do but lie when we talk of
   loving God whom we have not seen.

   21. And this commandment have we from Him, That he who loves God love
   his brother, also. Now let us read what another Apostle has to say,
   under the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, upon this subject of
   Christian love. Turn to Paul's Epistle to the Philippians, the fourth
   chapter.

   Philippians 4:1. Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for,
   my joy and crown, so standfast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. It is a
   great joy to a minister, as it was to the Apostle Paul, to have
   converts. But that joy is greatly diminished when they do not stand
   fast--then, indeed, every supposed joy becomes a sorrow and, instead of
   the roses which yield a sweet perfume to the Lord's servant--thorns
   begin to prick and wound his heart.

   2. I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
   mind in the Lord. Only two women and we do not know who they were, yet
   Paul gives each of them a, "beseech"--"I beseech Euodias, and beseech
   Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord." If there are only
   two of the most obscure Sisters in the Church who are quarrelling,
   their differences ought to be brought to an end at once. There should
   be no disagreements among Christians! Love should reign, peace should
   predominate. If there is anything contrary to such a state as that, God
   grant that it may soon be brought to an end!

   3. And I entreat you, also, true yoke fellow, help, those women which
   labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement, also, and with other of my
   fellow laborers, whose names are in the Book of Life. Brother, do all
   the good you can to help everybody else to do good! Help those whose
   names are in the Book of Life, even if they are not known anywhere
   else. Also help the "Clement" whose name is known--be sure to help him.
   Indeed, help everybody! There is an office in the Church of Christ
   which we do not sufficiently recognize, but which ought to be
   abundantly filled. Paul mentions it in writing to the Corinthians. He
   says, "And God has set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondarily
   prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of
   healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues." It is the office
   of certain Christians to be "helps." May we always have many such
   "helps" among us! Did you ever notice that almost every time that
   Bartholomew is mentioned in Scripture, we read, "and Bartholomew"? He
   is never spoken of alone, but it is written, "Philip, and Bartholomew,"
   or, "Bartholomew and Matthew." It is good to have some Bartholomews who
   are always helping somebody else, so that when there is any good work
   to be done, Bartholomew is always ready to share in it, for he shall
   also have a part in the reward at the last.

   4. Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice. The very word,
   "rejoice," seems to imply a reduplication. It is joy, and re-joy, joy
   over again! But here, you see, it is a fourfold rejoicing; joy, and
   re-joy; and again I say, joy, and re-joy! And this is to be the
   Christian's continual experience, for the Apostle says, "Rejoice in the
   Lord always."

   5. 6. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
   Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication
   with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. Have no
   care, but much prayer. Prayer is the cure for care! If you are in
   trouble, "Let your requests be made known," not to your neighbors, but,
   "unto

   God."

   7, 8. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep
   your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever
   things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just,
   whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things
   are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise,
   think on these things. Be on the side of everything that is good and
   right, everything that helps true human progress, everything that
   increases virtue and purity. As a Christian, take an interest in
   everything that helps to make men true, honest, just, pure, and lovely.

   9. Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard
   and seen in me, do; and the God of peace shall be with you. May the
   Lord fulfill that gracious Word to all of us, "The God of peace shall
   be with you"! Amen.

The Blessings of Public Worship

   (No. 2395)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 13, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 3, 1887.

   "Two men went up into the Temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the
   other a publican." Luke 18:10.

   THIS is called a parable, yet it is rather an incident, an anecdote, a
   statement of facts. You will observe that our Lord never used a fable.
   Fables may be employed to set forth that which is earth-born, but a
   parable, which is, in itself, true, is alone adapted to set forth
   spiritual Truths of God. I say this just now because I read, the other
   day, an assertion that the story of the rich man and Lazarus was only a
   fable, like that of Jotham. But the most of our Lord's parables are not
   only parables, but literal facts--and all of them might be facts. I
   would almost go the length of saying that all of them have been actual
   facts and in this case there is nothing parabolic at all. It is the
   statement of an incident which did literally occur, for truth is best
   illustrated by truth and, as Christ had nothing to teach but what was
   pure Truth, He illustrated it by Truth and never went into the realm of
   fiction, or invented a tale, or told a story which was not a fact, much
   less did He ever teach by a mere fable!

   There were two men who went into the Temple to pray. They prayed in
   just the way that our Lord describes and they went away, the one
   justified, and the other without a blessing. I am not going into the
   full teaching of the parable on this occasion, but I want to make a few
   observations concerning public worship in the Lord's House. Commencing
   to preach, again, on Thursday nights, after my season of rest, I
   thought that this sermon should be a sort of preface or introduction to
   our gatherings for prayer, praise, preaching and hearing the Word. God
   grant us a blessing in beginning, again, this holy employment. And may
   we be in health and strength and spiritual vigor, and be of some use to
   the people of God!

   I. Commencing, then, I would say, first, that IT IS WELL TO WORSHIP GOD
   IN PUBLIC--"Two men went up into the Temple to pray."

   It is good to pray anywhere. He that does not pray in his closet is but
   a hypocrite when he pretends to pray in the Temple. But, though we pray
   in the closet--though we get into such a habit of prayer and are so
   full of the spirit of prayer that we can pray anywhere--it is well to
   go and mingle with others and openly worship God who delights to be
   thus worshipped. It was written very early in the history of our race,
   "Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord." It has been the
   custom of the godly to meet for worship in all times. The sheep of
   Christ are gregarious--this is their nature, they love to gather
   themselves into congregations, to feed in the same pasture--and to
   enjoy, together, the Presence of their great Shepherd. It will always
   be so. The more pious and godly men are, alone, the more will they love
   associated worship. If it should ever happily come to pass that each
   feeble one among us should be as David, and every David should be as
   the angel of the Lord, yet even then we would find strength and help in
   our service for God by meeting together for united worship. The
   Apostolic command is, "Let us consider one another to provoke unto love
   and to good works: not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,
   as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the
   more, as you see the day approaching." Public worship is not
   everything--if there were no private worship, it would be nothing by
   itself. To go up to the Temple is not everything. The man who does not
   meet God outside the Temple will not meet God inside the Temple, he may
   rest assured of that.

   Yet, it is well, it is desirable that it should be said of us as it was
   said of the men mentioned in our text, "Two men went up into the Temple
   to pray." For public worship is, first of all, an open avowal of our
   faith in God and of our belief in prayer. If we pray in private, nobody
   knows it. At least nobody should know it, for our Lord's direction is
   very plain,

   "You, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut
   your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father
   which sees in secret shall reward you openly." Our acts of personal
   devotion must be sacred to God and our own souls, but when we go up to
   the public assembly--whether it is but of two or three, or of many
   thousands, it matters not--there is, to that extent, an open
   declaration that we believe in God, that, let others do as they may, as
   for us, we worship Him, we believe in the reality and power and
   usefulness of prayer and, therefore, in the light of day, before all
   men, we gather ourselves together to pray! I thank God that there are,
   in this unbelieving London, so many thousands of assemblies of
   worshipping people--a public testimony constantly borne to the fact
   that we do believe in God and that we do believe in prayer!

   Public worship is also, in the next place, a good way of securing unity
   in prayer. A number of persons may agree to pray about one thing, yet
   they may never see each other's faces--their prayers may blend at the
   Mercy Seat, but they must lack an emphatic consciousness of unity such
   as we have who come together to pray. Our Lord Jesus promised His
   special Presence to the united gatherings of His people when He said.
   "Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the
   midst of them." Oh, dear Friends, what should we do if we were not able
   to come together to mingle our sighs and cries and tears and, better
   still, to blend our joys, our Psalms, our shouts of victory? As we are
   members of one mystical body, it is but right that we should, as
   members of that one body, worship together, lifting up the joyous song
   in tuneful harmony and blending our supplications!--

   "Around our common Mercy Seat." I think, also, that public worship is a
   great means of quickening. At any rate, it is so to me. I never feel
   that I can pray as well as when I am in the midst of my own dear
   friends and, oftentimes, when things are flagging within the soul, to
   get together with brighter spirits, in whom the life of God is more
   vigorous, is a great help to me. It does not seem so very long
   ago--although these spectacles and my many gray hairs tell me that it
   must have been long since-- that I used to say to my mother that hymn
   which begins--

   "Lord, how delightful 'tis to see

   A whole assembly worship Thee!

   At once they sing, at once they pray;

   They hear of Heaven, and learn the Way." Dr. Watts put it very well and
   I can utter the same sentiment--

   "Lord how delightful 'tis to see

   This vast assembly worship Thee!" when the house is full from floor to
   ceiling--

   "At once they sing, at once they pray; They hear of Heaven, and learn
   the Way." Those two men, of whom our Savior spoke, did well to go up to
   the Temple to pray! And we shall do well not to cease from the habit of
   assembling ourselves together for public worship in the Lord's House.

   Then, dear Friends, public worship is a part of the great system by
   which God blesses the world. It has much to do with the gathering, the
   sustenance, the strengthening, the invigorating and the extension of
   the Church of Christ. And it is through the Church of Christ that God
   accomplishes His purposes in the world. Oh, the blessings that come to
   us in our public assemblies! Are there not, sometimes, days of Heaven
   upon earth? Have we not felt our hearts burning within us when we have
   been listening to the Word of God, or joining in praise or prayer?
   Those Houses of God where the Gospel is truly preached, whatever their
   architecture may be, are the beauty and the bulwarks of the land! God
   bless them! Wherever the Lord's people are gathered together, in a
   cathedral or in a barn--it does not matter where--it is none other than
   the House of God and the very gate of Heaven when God is there! And who
   among us would dare to stay away? As long as we have legs to carry us
   and health with which to use those legs, let us be found among the
   waiting assemblies in God's sanctuary!

   For, once more, it seems to me that public worship on earth is a
   rehearsal for the service of Heaven. We shall sing together, there,
   Brothers and Sisters, not solos, but grand chorales and choruses! We
   shall take parts in the Divine oratorio of redemption--it will not be
   some one melodious voice, alone, that shall lift up the eternal
   hallelujah! I spoke playfully of our brother Mayers singing the
   Hallelujah Chorus all by himself, but neither he nor any other man can
   do that! We shall all have to take our parts to make the harmony
   complete. I may never be able to rise to certain notes unless my voice
   shall be wondrously changed, but some other sinner, saved by Grace,
   will run up the scale--nobody knows how high-- and what a range of
   melody the music will have in Heaven!

   I believe that our poor scales and modes of singing, here, are nothing
   at all compared with what there will be in the upper regions! There,
   the bass shall be deeper and yet the notes shall be higher than those
   of earth. Even the crash of the loudest thunder shall be only like a
   whisper in comparison with the celestial music of the new song before
   the Throne of God! John spoke of it as "the voice of many waters." The
   waves of one ocean can make a deafening, booming noise, but in Heaven
   there shall be, as it were, the sound of sea on sea, Atlantic upon
   Pacific, one piled upon another and all dashing and crashing with the
   everlasting hallelujahs from the gladsome hearts of the multitude that
   no man can number! I expect to be there and I remember that verse in
   one of our hymns that says--

   "I would begin the music here,

   And so my soul should rise;

   Oh, for some heavenly notes to bear

   My passions to the skies!"

   But you cannot sing that heavenly anthem alone, because however well
   you can sing by yourself, that is not the way you will have to sing in
   Heaven--there you will have to sing in harmony with all the
   blood-washed hosts. Therefore let us often come up to the Lord's House,
   and when we are gathered together, let us again take up the words of
   Dr. Watts, and say--

   "I have been there and still would go, 'Tis like a little Heaven
   below." That little Heaven below shall help to prepare us for the great
   Heaven above! That is our first observation, then. It is well to
   worship God in public.

   II. Secondly, IT IS WELL TO HAVE A REASON WHEN WE GO UP TO PUBLIC
   WORSHIP. "Two men went up into the Temple to pray." They went there for
   that express purpose.

   Now, whenever we go to the assembly of God's people, we should have
   some good reason--and the right reason is that which these two men
   had--they went up to the Temple to pray. I would rather that you came
   with a bad reason than that you did not come at all. I have known
   people come to pick pockets and yet they have gone away with a
   blessing. I am sorry if any of you came, tonight, for that reason, yet
   I am glad that you are here. Perhaps friends will prevent you from
   committing the sin of theft by taking a little extra care of their
   pockets! I have known persons go into the House of God out of sheer
   mockery and yet God has blessed them, for His ways are strangely
   sovereign. But that is to be ascribed to matchless mercy and it is not
   the way we ought to appear before the Lord!

   When we go to the sanctuary, we should go for a reason, we should go up
   to pray--we should not go merely from custom. Do we not often do that?
   Not so much on Thursday nights, I think, for people come, then, because
   they like to come. But on Sundays it is such a proper thing with
   certain persons to go to a place of worship that they almost wish it
   was not so proper and they would like to have a good excuse for staying
   home! Well, if you come only out of custom and you do not get a
   blessing, I pray you, do not wonder at it! If you do not come for
   anything and you do not get anything, do not be disappointed! If you go
   to a shop across the road and do not mean to buy anything, do not be
   surprised if you come out with nothing--and if you come here and do not
   need anything, very well, you will go away with nothing! Is it not just
   what you might have expected? He who goes to the river and takes no rod
   or net with him, will have no fish in his basket, even though there may
   be shoals of them in the water! So, if we want to be blessed in our
   worship, we must come with a reason, even as these two men went up into
   the Temple "to pray."

   Neither do I think that we should come up to the assembly of God's
   people merely to hear sermons. The proper thing is to come "to pray."
   "But we do hear sermons," says one. Yes, but I hope that does not
   hinder your praying! Somebody said, the other day, that people who go
   to Church go to pray, but that we who go to Chapel go to hear sermons.
   My dear Friend, that remark shows what sort of sermons you get at
   Church, because those who come to hear us preach pray while we are
   preaching and they find that there is nothing that helps them to pray
   as much as a good sermon does! In fact, there is no worship of God that
   is better than the hearing of a sermon! I venture to say that if a
   sermon is well heard, it puts faith in exercise as you believe it, it
   puts love in exercise as you enjoy it, it puts gratitude in exercise as
   you think of all the blessings that God has given to you!

   If the sermon is what it should be, it stirs all the coals of fire in
   your spirit and makes them burn with a brighter flame and a more
   vehement heat. To imply that hearing a sermon is not worship is really
   to slander your minister! It must be a very bad sermon in which there
   is, as it were, a jerk out of the prayers to get into it, for the
   supplication should lead up to the sermon, and then the discourse
   should be a continuation of the prayer that has preceded it and bring
   it back upon the mind, again, so that all present may pray the better
   and worship God the more acceptably because of the sermon to which they
   have been listening.

   Still, if anybody comes to hear a sermon, especially as, perhaps, some
   of you came while I was away, to criticize the preacher, that is not
   the way to get a blessing! I do not mind if you criticize me--you may
   do that when you like--only you will not get blessed by doing it. But
   when there are other preachers here and someone says that he does not
   like this one, and another says that he does not like the other, then,
   if you do not get a blessing out of the service, who is to blame? "Two
   men went up into the Temple to pray." And if we go to the House of God
   and seek to turn the whole of the worship into a prayer, we shall not
   come away without a blessing! The main objective in all worship is that
   we get near to God and really pray to Him.

   Neither do I think that we should go to the House of God merely to get
   comforted and cheered. That is a very sweet result from hearing the
   Word of God, but it should not be our main objective in going to hear
   it--we should meet together that we may draw near to God. If it is the
   Lord's will not to comfort but to rebuke us, and if it is His purpose
   not to cheer but to cast us down, we shall still feel, "What I received
   came from God. I prayed to Him and He spoke to me and I had special
   fellowship with the living God, while I was also in communion with my
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ. That is what I went for, and that is
   what I have had."

   The publican teaches us what we should go to the House of God to do and
   to say. There should be, in God's Presence, confession of sin. We
   should, each one of us, when we draw near to the Lord, bow down in His
   Presence with reverent awe. If the very angels veil their faces when
   they come near Him, we must humbly bow before Him when we come to
   worship in His House! He is in Heaven and we are upon earth. He is our
   Father, but He is also our Father who is in Heaven--and we poor sinful
   creatures can never come into the light of His Presence without
   perceiving that we are full of sin. I have heard some people talk about
   "walking in the light as God is in the light," as if that meant that
   they had no sin. Listen to what the Apostle John says, "If we walk in
   the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another."
   And then, "the blood of Jesus Christ His Son," is still needed, for
   even then it, "cleanses us from all sin." Without its continual
   application, there would be no walking in the light--and the more
   walking in the Light of God there is, the clearer will be the
   perception of every speck and stain in the character! So, the more true
   our worship is, the more certain shall we be to make confession of sin.

   Communion with God and confession of sin should always be remembered by
   us when we come up to the House of

   God.

   Then there should be asking for mercy. We should come as paupers
   seeking relief. We should come as rebels craving pardon. We should come
   as pardoned ones still asking renewed tokens of forgiveness--as men,
   once washed, who still come, that their feet may be cleansed--that they
   may be clean every whit as they pursue their course on the journey of
   life.

   In the publican's prayer there is, in the Greek, a reference to
   sacrifice. He cried, "Lord, be propitious to me, the sinner." "Have
   mercy upon me for the sake of the Great Propitiation, the Great
   Expiation." They who come up to God's House for the right reason, come
   to find Jesus, to prove the power of His precious blood, to be perfumed
   with the incense of His all-sufficient merit and to be covered with His
   matchless righteousness! That is the right way of coming up to the
   assembly of God's people, to speak with Him humbly, for we are sinful.
   Prayerfully, for we are full of need. Believingly, for Jesus has
   offered a Sacrifice and we are accepted in and through Him. That, dear
   Friends, is the second division of my discourse--it is well to have a
   reason when we go up to public worship.

   I will pause, here, and pass a few questions round for everyone to ask,
   "Did I come, tonight, for such a reason? Is that my general habit, to
   go up to my place of worship for such a reason? Or do I go jauntily, as
   if it were an ordinary transaction to go up for the worship of God?" I
   will not propose any answers to you--your own consciences will be able
   to give the reply. Only let them speak and God bless the inquiry to you
   all!

   III. Thirdly, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO UP TO PUBLIC WORSHIP WITH A GOOD
   REASON AND YET TO FORGET IT. "Two men went up into the Temple to pray;
   the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."

   It was very remarkable that a Pharisee should forget his reason--that
   is the one point concerning him to which I am going to call your
   attention--he went up to the Temple to pray, but he did not pray. He
   never prayed a word, but he did something else. If it had been written,
   "Two men went up into the Temple to boast," I would give the Pharisee
   the palm, for he certainly did that magnificently! But as it is said,
   "Two men went up into the Temple to pray," then it is certain that this
   Pharisee quite forgot why he had come, for he never prayed at all!

   Well, now, who was the gentleman that forgot his reason? It was the
   person who ought especially to have remembered it, for he was a
   Pharisee! By profession he was a separatist from others because of his
   supposed peculiar holiness. He was a man amazingly acquainted with the
   Word of God, at least, with the letter of it. He wore some little black
   boxes between his eyes with texts of Scripture inscribed upon them and
   he wore others round his wrist. And he had very broad blue borders on
   his garments, for he was particularly observant of what he read in the
   Law of Moses. And, generally, a Pharisee was a teacher. He was first
   cousin to a Scribe and often was a Scribe, himself. He had written out
   a copy of the Law and he had its precepts at his fingertips!

   Now, surely, if there is anybody who goes up to the Temple to pray,
   this is the man who will pray. If anybody forgets why he came, it will
   not be this person! But, listen. That was the very man who did forget
   all about it and this may be true of a minister, a deacon, an elder,
   one of the Brothers and Sisters who prays at Prayer Meetings, the
   leader of a Bible class, a teacher in the Sunday school, the best sort
   of people. "Oh," you exclaim, "we cannot say anything but what is
   honorable of them!" And yet it was one of this class who forgot why he
   went up into the Temple! Let me remind you Church members who make a
   loud profession, that it was a great professor who went up to the
   Temple to pray and did not do it! What would you say to your boy, who
   went to a shop, and then came home and said that he had forgotten his
   reason? And what will you say to yourself, dear Friend, especially if
   you happen to be somebody notable, if it should be you who went up to
   the Temple to pray, and did not pray? Oh, do not let it be so in your
   case! Do not, tonight, leave this house till you have had real
   fellowship with God, through JESUS CHRIST His Son, if you have never
   had it before!

   How do we know that this man forgot his reason? We know it by what he
   said. He did not pray at all. He said, "God, I thank You that I am not
   as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
   publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I
   possess." By his words he must be judged, as you and I will be--and his
   words go to prove that he forgot why he went up to the Temple. He acted
   as though he was in his own house, praising himself, instead of being
   in God's House, where the Lord, alone, is to be praised!

   Why did this man fall into this great blunder and forget why he went up
   to the Temple? He did it because he was so full of himself that there
   was no room for God in his heart. He was so satisfied with himself that
   he felt no need of prayer. He already had all that he required and he
   had so much that he could only stand still and overflow with a kind of
   gratitude to the one to whom he owed everything, namely, himself.
   Though he said, "God, I thank Fou," He did not mean it--he meant all
   the praise for himself! He was so fine a bird and had such rich
   feathers that he felt that everybody ought to admire him as much as he
   admired himself!

   Well now, Brothers and Sisters, you will say to me, "Has this any
   bearing upon us?" Listen. Do you ever feel perfectly satisfied with
   yourselves? Are there not times when there is no sin that burns the
   conscience, when you think that you are somebody, a pattern saint, a
   highly experienced good old man, a rare Christian matron, and so on?
   The devil tells you all that, does he not? And you believe him! Or else
   you say that you are such a smart young man--you have only lately
   joined the Church, yet you have already got into the Lord's work in a
   wonderful way--there must be a great deal in you. You do not put this
   boasting into English, because we do not talk English to our hearts
   when we get proud--it is a sort of Greek which we talk, by which we try
   to conceal our own meaning from ourselves! Then we feel, perhaps, that
   we are getting perfect--and that is the time when we forget to pray!
   And we go into the House of God and, when we come out, we make some
   remark about the preacher's manner, or about Sister So-and-So, whose
   bonnet is really too smart for a Christian woman to wear, or about our
   friend, So-and-So, who spoke rather roughly to us. We--WE-- WE--we are
   so good that we can find fault with all others and say, "God, I thank
   You that I am not as other men are, or even as this publican!" And then
   we do not pray.

   Whenever you get one inch above the ground in your own esteem, you are
   that inch too high! The way to Heaven is down, down, down! As to self,
   it must sink. Our sense of sin must grow deeper and deeper, and a sense
   of obligation to Grace must be more and more fully impressed upon our
   heart until we are able to say with great emphasis, though it is in the
   deep silence of the soul, "God be merciful to me, the sinner!"
   Otherwise, we shall come to the Temple on the reason of prayer and we
   shall forget it. We shall go to the closet to pray and yet shall not
   pray. Or we shall read the Bible and not find anything upon which to
   feed our souls because we are not hungry, but full. We shall not seek
   true wealth, because we shall fancy we are not poor, but rich. We shall
   not go to the Source of all might because we shall imagine we are not
   weak, but strong. If we go up to the Temple as the Pharisee did, there
   will be nothing for us, even in the place where prayer is known to be
   made.

   IV. So I close this discourse with a fourth observation. IT IS POSSIBLE
   TO CARRY OUT OUR REASON FOR

   GOING TO PUBLIC WORSHIP. We can go up to the Temple to pray and really
   pray!

   Who is the man who is most likely to pray? According to this parable,
   it was the publican. It was a man under a sense of sin. It was a man
   who felt that he was the sinner, even if nobody else was a sinner. It
   was this man to whom sin was a reality, not a fiction, and to whom the
   mercy of God was a real need, and not a mere doctrine, who craved that
   mercy at the Throne of God and felt that only Sovereign Grace could
   give it! It was this man who pleaded the precious blood of the
   Propitiation and felt that only by that way could he receive pardon.
   That was the man who truly prayed! Oh, have I not, sometimes, gone to
   pray with a breaking heart, groaning, crying and longing to see my
   Lord's face, and to have a sense of acceptance in the Beloved? And I
   have come away and felt that I had not prayed because I could not use
   language and words such as I would wish to use--and yet, on looking
   back, I have seen that it was then that I prayed most!

   Next to the sense of sin, the publican had a sense of need. When the
   need is felt the heaviest, prayer is truest. When the soul is lowest,
   then the flood of supplication is the highest. I am sure you pray best
   when you have least satisfaction with yourself, and you get nearest to
   God when you get farthest from self. When you feel that you are not
   worthy to lift up your eyes to Heaven, it is then that Heaven's eyes
   look down on you! The sorrowful thought of a broken heart is
   immeasurably better than the indifference of a callous spirit. Bless
   God for a humble mind that trembles at His Word--it is much better than
   that presumption which puts aside all feeling. There are some who will
   go to Heaven questioning their own state all the way, yet they will
   arrive there safely. And there are some who never doubted their state
   who may have to doubt it when it is too late! Anyway, it is a deep
   sense of sin, a deep sense of need, a deep sense of dependence upon
   Sovereign Grace, that helps a man to come to the House of God and to go
   away with his mission accomplished.

   Let us all try to bring our needs before God. Let us sink ourselves in
   His Presence into the very depths, and then let us come and joyfully
   take what He freely offers to all who trust His dear Son! Let us
   receive Grace at His hands, not as courtiers who have a right, but as
   those who feel like dogs under the table and yet cry, "Lord, even the
   dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table."

   The publican excites our pity as we hear his groans and sighs, and see
   him smite upon his breast. But when we know that this is the man whom
   God blessed, and that he went to his house justified, rather than the
   other, we no longer pity him, but we seek to emulate his repentance and
   his Grace, and we pray the Lord to help us, thus, to come to His feast
   with a hearty appetite, thus to come to His wardrobe conscious of our
   own rags, thus to come to His fullness admitting our own emptiness,
   thus to come to the Fountain of Eternal Life feeling that apart from it
   we are dead! Then shall we truly pray, even as this despised publican
   did!

   Poor Soul, almost in despair, you think, "I have no right to be here. I
   am so guilty, I am so vile." You are the very sort of sinner Christ
   died to save! Not sham sinners who have to pretend to be sinners, but
   you miserable sinners, you real sinners! Not you who make marks on your
   skin, like some beggars do, that you may seem to be wounded, but you
   who are as bad as you can be--you who have sinned so deeply that you
   feel as if you were already lost, you who lie at Hell's dark door, you
   who are dragged about by the hair of your head by the foul fiend of the
   Pit--you who are in your own esteem the worst of all men! Come to
   Christ tonight!

   Make way for them! Stand back, for these are the people He came to
   save! He has come "to seek and to save that which was lost." Believe
   that Christ died to save you, and you are saved! Throw yourself on His
   atoning Sacrifice, and it avails for you at once! Glorify Him by
   trusting Him for your salvation! Let Him be your High Priest and, from
   first to last, your Savior, and He is yours as surely as you are a
   living man or woman! Go your way justified rather than the other who
   does not need the Propitiation of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord bless
   you! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 122; LUKE 18:1-14.

   We will read two portions of Scripture relating to public worship. The
   first will be Psalm 122, one of David's "Songs of degrees."

   Psalm 122:1. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the
   House of the LORD. "I was glad for my own sake, for I hungered and
   thirsted to go into the House of the Lord. I was glad for the sake of
   those who offered to go with me, for I delight to see in others a
   longing desire to profit by the means of Grace. I was glad when they
   said unto me, 'Let us go into the house of the Lord.'"

   2, 3. Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is
   built as a city that is compact together. So is every true Church of
   God when it is in a healthy state. There are no divisions, no
   schisms--"Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together." It is
   not a long straggling street, a dislocated village, but all the houses
   are rightly and regularly placed and surrounded with strong munitions
   of defense against the adversary. May this Church always be blessed
   with such unity that it shall be as a city that is compact together!

   4. Where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony
   of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. We should go up to
   the House of God, then, for two purposes. First, "unto the testimony of
   Israel," that is, to hear what God testifies to us and, also, to
   publicly testify our confidence in Him. And, next, we should go up "to
   give thanks unto the name of the Lord." Especially should we do this
   when we have been restored from beds of languishing sickness and pain,
   or when we come up from the house of mourning. But what is there in
   God's House that should tempt us to go there?

   5. For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of
   David. The preaching of the Gospel is like the setting up of a Throne
   of Judgment, "for the Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper
   than any two-edged sword, piercing, even, to the dividing asunder of
   soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of
   the thoughts and intents of the heart." And long before the last Great
   Judgment Day arrives, and the final assize begins, the ministry of the
   Gospel is God's Judgment Seat at which ungodly men may learn what they
   are in the sight of the Judge of All-- what their present state of
   condemnation is and what it will finally be unless they repent!

   6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Ask that she may be free from
   persecution without, and from anything like disturbance within--"Pray
   for the peace of Jerusalem."

   6. They shall prosper that love You. Neglect of the means of Grace is
   the death of all soul-prosperity. But an earnest love of the House of
   God and all who belong to God will bring us true spiritual prosperity.

   7-9. Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
   For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within
   you. Because of the House of the LORD our God I will seek your good.
   Now let us read a short passage out of the Gospel according to Luke.

   Luke 18:1-7. And He spoke a parable unto them to this end, that men
   ought always to pray, and not to faint; saying, There was in a city a
   judge which feared not God, neither regarded man: and there was a widow
   in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.
   And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself,
   Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubles
   me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And
   the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says. And shall not God
   avenge His own elect which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear
   long with them? He hears their prayer a long time because it does not
   weary Him. It pleases Him! He loves to hear their sighs and cries, but
   will He not yield to their entreaties? What do you think? Shall not the
   good, gracious, loving God yield, at length?

   8. I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the
   Son of Man comes, shall He find faith on the earth? Faith enough to
   make such prayers as this? Faith enough to pray with importunity? Oh,
   if we had faith enough to resolve to have a blessing and determined
   never to cease crying to God until we had it, we should have far more
   favors than we have so far gained from our God!

   9-12. And He spoke this parable unto certain which trusted in
   themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: two men went
   up into the Temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a
   publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
   You, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
   or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of
   all that I possess. A fine peacock, truly! See how he spreads out his
   feathers and struts before God, glorifying himself?

   13. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as
   his eyes unto Heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be
   merciful to me a sinner. "The sinner," it should be--it is emphatically
   so in the Greek. There is a Pharisee, the righteous man according to
   his own estimate, and all the rest were sinners. Here is the publican,
   he is the sinner, and he thinks everybody else is righteous. These were
   two very conspicuous individuals, the self-righteous man and the
   sinner! And they are both here tonight! I will not ask them to stand
   up, but no doubt they are both of them present. Now what became of
   them?

   14. I tell you, this man--The sinner

   14. Went down to his house justified rather than the other: for
   everyone that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles
   himself shall be exalted. It is God's usual method to reverse what man
   does and to turn things the other way around--"Everyone that exalts
   himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted."
   You remember how the Virgin Mary, in her song, praised the Lord for
   this very habit of His--"He has put down the mighty from their seats
   and exalted them of low degree. He has filled the hungry with good
   things; and the rich He has sent away empty." That is His regular way
   of working and He will continue to do so!

Eternal Life!

   (No. 2396)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 20, 1895,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNAOLE, NEWINOTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 6, 1887.

   "This is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true God, and
   Jesus Christ, whom You have sent." John 17:3.

   "We are in Him that is true, even in His Son, Jesus Christ. This is the
   true God, and eternal life. Little children, keep yourselves from
   idols." 1 John 5:20,21.

   OUR subject this morning [Sermon #1946, Volume 33--Eternal Life within
   Present Grasp] was concerning laying hold on eternal life, and I
   thought that I would say a little more, tonight, about eternal life.
   Many people, when they hear or read that expression, suppose that it
   means Heaven. It does mean that, but it means much more. Eternal life
   commences here--it begins in the Believer as soon as he is born again.
   Then he receives into him that same life which he will have throughout
   eternity! Eternal life is not a thing of changes. The river widens and
   deepens, as I showed you this morning, but it is always the same river
   of the Water of Life--it always flows from the same Source--it is
   always constituted in the same manner. The life of the new-born
   Christian who, only a few minutes ago began to pray, is precisely the
   same life which is to be found in yonder bright spirits that have now
   been thousands of years in perfection at the right hand of God praising
   His name! Death does not transport Believers into a new life--it simply
   rids us of certain impediments that hamper our true life in its upward
   flow. The life of the Christian, here, is the triumphant life that is
   to be enjoyed hereafter! It is one and the same life so far as its real
   nature is concerned.

   It was the great end of the life, death and work of Christ to give this
   eternal life to all Believers. He came into the world on purpose, that
   they should forever live through Him. He has not accomplished His
   design in you, my Hearer, unless He has made you live unto God. There
   is a Savior--that you know--but He is not your Savior unless He has
   infused into you a life infinitely superior to that which was born in
   you at the first. "You must be born again." And by that new birth you
   must receive a higher and more Divine life than that which throbs in
   your bosom by nature. Judge for yourself whether Christ has come into
   the world to any purpose that affects you and especially judge whether
   you have received eternal life at His hands. Remember how it is
   written, "As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
   sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born,
   not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
   of God." The ever-living God is not the Father of dead souls, but He is
   the Father of those whom He has quickened--and the power to become sons
   of God lies, in a great measure, in the life which is Divinely imparted
   to all who receive Christ and believe on His name.

   It is in the power of Christ to give this eternal life. In the verse
   preceding our first text, the Lord Jesus, addressing His Father, says
   of Himself, "You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should
   give eternal life to as many as You have given Him." The Father has
   life in Himself and He quickens all who live--and even so, the Son of
   God, our Lord Jesus Christ, has life in Himself--and this life He
   imparts to all who believe in Him. It is in His power to bestow that
   life upon every soul that trusts Him and He delights in exercising His
   Divine prerogative.

   Our Lord Jesus bestows this eternal life only upon His elect. Speaking
   to His Father, in the verse I quoted just now, He says of Himself, "You
   have given Him power over all flesh that He should give eternal life to
   as many as You have given Him." God has an elect people. So long as the
   Bible endures, there is no way of getting that doctrine out of it
   unless men willfully pervert its plainest teaching. From before the
   foundation of the world the Lord chose a people unto

   Himself, according to the Sovereign purpose of His own will, even as He
   says, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have
   compassion on whom I will have compassion."

   These people whom God has chosen are made known by their being
   quickened, in due time, into a higher and superior life than that of
   the flesh. Till then they are like the rest of mankind--dead as the dry
   bones of Ezekiel's Valley of Vision--but the Divine breath of the
   Eternal Spirit blows upon them and they are made to live and stand upon
   their feet, an exceedingly great army! By this test can all of you know
   whether you are the subjects upon whom God's Grace has worked. Is there
   a new life within your soul? Have you been raised from death unto life?
   Have you been made to feel new emotions, new desires, new longings, new
   pains and new joys? For, if you have, then are you the people of God!
   But if not, I pray that in you, also, Divine Grace may yet be thus
   magnified.

   The question for us now to consider is in what does this eternal life
   consist? I do not propose to answer the question as it might be
   answered, in various ways, but only according to the first of our two
   texts--"This is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent."

   I. First, then, ETERNAL LIFE CONSISTS IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ONLY TRUE
   GOD. Let us think for a little while upon the lack of this knowledge.
   The loss of this knowledge followed upon the Fall. As long as man knew
   his God, trusted his God and obeyed his God, he was happy enough. But
   man must know the fallen spirit and, once making acquaintance with him,
   man must know the knowledge of good and evil. And, contrary to the
   Lord's command, he must take of the forbidden fruit and eat. So he lost
   the knowledge of God and, with that loss, he lost everything! The
   highest privilege of manhood is to be acquainted with God--and when our
   first father turned his back upon God and began to unlearn whatever he
   had known of his Creator and to forget all that had been revealed
   concerning his Lord, then came the Fall--and it was a fall, indeed!

   Out of this lack of knowledge of God grew all manner of idolatries. Man
   must have a God--he cannot be happy without one. There are some who
   struggle hard before they yield, but, as surely as a dog must have a
   master, so surely man must have a God! There is a great superior Being,
   our Creator, Preserver and Judge, whom we must have as our Redeemer, or
   else we are utterly undone. Without God, our nature is disabled and
   divided--its best part has run away--it becomes dead, in fact, when it
   becomes separated from God. It was the lack of knowledge of the only
   true God that led men to bow down before blocks of wood and stone, to
   worship the sun, moon and stars--and to set up all manner of visible
   objects and to say of them--"These are our gods." Oh, to what terrible
   mischief, to what mental and spiritual death, the lack of the knowledge
   of God has led the sons of men!

   Nor is this all that the lack of the knowledge of the true God has
   produced in us. It has spoiled the best aspirations of the noblest men
   such as Plato and Socrates. Blindly feeling after God, yet without
   truly knowing Him, what could they do? They could rise to no great
   height--they could accomplish but little. Men such as they reared an
   altar and inscribed thereon, "To the unknown god." But what kind of
   prayer is that which is offered to a god whom we do not know? What
   comfort can come out of an unknown god? What peace, what rest, what joy
   can come from a being after whom we grope in the dark, but whom we do
   not know? Not to know the only true God is death--death even to the
   noblest spirits among us! But it is a much more terrible death to those
   who, knowing nothing of God, seek that which will please self, indulge
   their vile lusts and follow their unbridled passions! What is all that,
   indeed, but the result of the fact that, not knowing God, they are
   seeking to submit themselves to some other lord? Man must have a
   master! He is like a horse that must have a rider! He is so constituted
   that unless he yields himself to a power superior to himself, he
   grovels and sinks down yet more and more until his condition is little
   better than that of the beasts that perish! Indeed, in some respects,
   he is worse off than they are.

   I can scarcely picture what manhood would have been if we had never
   fallen. The chief joy, I think, would have been that each one among us
   would have had the only true God as ours. We should have been born into
   the world, whatever our circumstances, under the patronage of God! We
   would have gone forth to our labor, sweetly singing in the
   companionship of God. We would have retired to our rest at
   night--supposing that things had been as they are now--and we would
   have fallen asleep as in the embraces of our God, or on our Father's
   breast. Days would have had a brightness about them superior to any the
   sun can yield, and nights would have had nothing for us to dread even
   in their densest darkness, for the Lord would still have been there! As
   a child is happy and knows no care nor need while a good father
   provides for him everything he needs, such would man have been. Oh, men
   are miserable who have not known their God! Unhappy men! Well may
   Scripture speak of them as dead, for it is death to be without the
   knowledge of God!

   But, Brothers and Sisters, what is this knowledge of God which is
   eternal life? Let us talk a little about the meaning of this knowledge.
   It is not eternal life to know that there is a God! A great many people
   know as much as that and still remain dead. Those who know not that
   there is a God are dead in the dark, but those who know that there is a
   God and yet do not trust Him, are dead in the light! That condition is,
   perhaps, the worse of the two. At any rate, it involves a greater
   responsibility. Yet, to know that there is a God is not the same thing
   as knowing God. I may know that there is a Queen of England, but I may
   not know her. I know that there are many persons in the world whom I do
   not know and it is a sad thing for anyone to know that there is a God
   and yet not truly to know God.

   To explain what is meant by knowing God, I must say, first, that it is
   to know Him as God, that is to say, to know Him as God to us. I have
   already told you that everybody has something that is god to
   him--something that is superior to himself and which rules
   him--something to which he looks up to and which he worships. Now, the
   great invisible Jehovah, the one God that made Heaven and earth, in
   whose hands our breath is, who has revealed Himself in the Trinity of
   His Divine Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit--the God of Abraham, of
   Isaac, and of Jacob--the God of the whole earth, must be God to us!
   That means that we reverence Him, that we bow before Him as
   worshippers, that we submit ourselves to His Law, that we seek to do
   His pleasure. No man really knows God who does not know Him as God, and
   does not accept Him as His God--and to accept God as your God is
   eternal life! This is how eternal life becomes yours! And if you have
   come to that point, you have eternal life.

   Still, that statement does not fully explain what it is to know God. It
   is to be on terms of personal acquaintance with Him. The Lord is not to
   be seen, neither can His footsteps be heard, but to know God is to be
   conscious of His Presence by an inward sense which does both see and
   hear. It is to feel that He is everywhere--on the land or on the sea
   and, knowing that He is there, to rejoice in being with Him! In fact,
   it is to find great delight in this God who is not far from any of us.
   It is to be (let me put it very plainly) on speaking terms with Him! It
   is to be so reconciled to Him that you have no dread of Him, no bondage
   and fear when you think of Him.

   You then regard God as your best Friend whom you love and, in whom you
   delight, to whom you talk as naturally as you talk to friend or father,
   into whose bosom you pour your griefs, into whose heart you tell your
   joys. God is nearer than your most familiar friend, nearer to you than
   eyes and ears, nearer to you than your own body, for He gets within
   your soul, which your body can never do! If you really know,
   experimentally, what I am talking about, you have eternal life. If this
   is so, that you know the only true God, distinctly recognizing His
   Presence, speaking with Him and rejoicing in Him and, if, above all,
   you are striving to be like He--if His Spirit in you is photographing
   the image of God upon your nature so that the old image, which He gave
   to Adam, but which was effaced by sin, is being reproduced in you by
   the Holy Spirit--then you know the only true God and this, dear
   Friends, is eternal life!

   Now, having shown you what the lack of this knowledge produces and the
   meaning of this knowledge, let me briefly speak of the connection
   between the knowledge of God and eternal life.

   A man without God is a living man, of course, for he works, he eats, he
   drinks. Yes, but he has missed the only true life. He has missed a
   secret happiness which is the very essence of life and, without which
   life is really death. You do not know it, dear Hearer, if you have
   never believed in Christ! And I do not expect you to believe what I
   say, but let me tell you that there is a something that makes life
   worth living when you once come to know God. There is a secret bliss--I
   cannot call it anything less than bliss! There is a little Heaven, a
   compendious, compressed, essential Heaven which God drops into that
   soul that lives with Him, so that we know that which makes us leap for
   joy and makes us bless God that we were ever created! If I had no God,
   I could say, "Cursed was the day in which it was said to my mother that
   a man-child was born into the world." But now I thank God for my
   existence! Sometimes, when in great pain and anguish, yet having God
   with me, I have felt inclined not to curse the day of my birth, but to
   rejoice that I was ever born, even if I had to live a life of perpetual
   pain, seeing that I have a God who is, indeed, my own!

   To have a God also means that you have a grand objective in life. Look
   at many of you, how you work hard from morning to night just to provide
   enough to keep body and soul together. If you have not a God, you are
   wretched creatures, indeed! But the slave who tugs at the oar of the
   galley and receives no pay but the cruel lash, is a happy and blessed
   man if God is with him! Many and many a Huguenot prisoner, condemned
   for life to the galleys because of his faith, has been happier than the
   king upon his throne who thrust him there! With God, all conditions of
   life become life that is life, indeed--but without Him, there is
   nothing to live for! Here is a poor fellow who lives till he has
   accumulated millions-- it must be all the harder to die and leave so
   much, must it not? What is the good of it? To get a paragraph in the
   Illustrated London News saying that So-and-So died worth so much? Oh,
   the misery of having existed for so small a result! But when you have
   God, you have something to live for, something that makes every little
   thing sublime and turns the most common actions of daily life into a
   holy exercise of a royal priesthood unto the Most High!

   The man who has God also has the explanation of a great many things
   which puzzle other people and he has something better, still, for he
   has his God to fall back upon when he cannot explain anything. I like,
   sometimes, to have to pull up against a huge granite rock and feel, "I
   never shall see through that rock and I shall never see my way through
   that difficulty." Well, I do not need to see my way through it! I do
   not need a tunnel from here to New Zealand--do you? I know that I
   cannot go through the very heart of the earth and I have no wish to do
   so. I am very glad to know that I cannot, by a stamp of my foot, force
   my way through to the other side of the globe--it would be a poor globe
   if I could! I would not worship a god that I could fully understand. I
   do not know how I would feel devout over a faith which I perfectly
   comprehended. If I could put my religion into my pocket, like a box of
   lozenges, I should soon suck it all away, but I like something that is
   grander than my loftiest thought, more sublime than my noblest
   conceptions, and which tops me altogether! And I find it a blessed
   thing in life, when troubled with all these difficult problems of our
   teeming population and ever-present distress, to fall back upon this
   fact--"There is a God who will overrule it all and, from the seeming
   evil, will produce a good--and from that good something better, to His
   own praise and glory!"

   A man with God--you may strip him, but he is clothed in the Light of
   God. A man with God--you may shut him up in prison, but he is perfectly
   at liberty, for his spirit soars into the immensities! A man with
   God--he may be afflicted with a hundred diseases at once, but he has
   the best of all health, even the sanity of his soul! A man with God has
   a window to his room--a man without God goes round, and round, and
   round, and looks, but does not see anything at all! Sometimes he
   thinks, "I wish that I could see something, but there is nothing to be
   seen." To those who are without God, the future is all a blank--they
   call themselves "agnostics"--that is, men who do not know anything. But
   you who have God look for eternal life in His Presence. If men talk to
   you of joy, you say, "Oh, yes, there must be joy to one who is at peace
   with God. It cannot be that any man who loves God and is reconciled to
   Him, should be perpetually unhappy!" That cannot be, so that, in
   knowing God, there springs up in the man's heart a hope, no, an
   assurance that it must be well with his soul and that, though Heaven
   and earth should pass away, God's Word can never pass away and,
   therefore, the safety of the man who clings to that Word must be
   secure! Yes, to know the only true God is to get where life is life, to
   get into eternal life--not mere existence, but into that which is
   worthy to be called life, indeed!

   II. Now, dear Brothers and Sisters, in the second place, notice that
   ETERNAL LIFE ALSO CONSISTS IN THE

   KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS CHRIST, WHOM GOD HAS SENT--"This is life eternal,
   that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You
   have sent."

   Our second text shows that the first one by no means implies that Jesus
   Christ is not God, for it expressly declares, concerning Jesus Christ,
   "This is the true God, and eternal life." This is the teaching of both
   passages. It would not be eternal life to know God apart from Christ.
   God the Father, apart from Jesus Christ, is just an Almighty Being
   infinitely just, whose Laws I have violated--a Being infinitely loving,
   who would bless me, but who cannot do so while I violate His Laws--a
   God full of tremendous power and unerring wisdom who would exercise all
   these for me but that I, having broken His Law, the penalties of that
   Law are inevitable, and cannot be reversed! It was wise and just on
   God's part to append a penalty to sin--nothing could be crueler than to
   allow men to sin without being punished for it! It would be abhorrent
   to a God of Love as much as to a God of Justice if sin could be made a
   trifle and there were no punishment attached to it. The first knowledge
   you and I ever get of God, when we come to know Him, is as One who is
   infinitely loving, but who, nevertheless, no, who, for that very
   reason, is infinitely Just and must punish sin.

   No one knows the true God in the real sense of knowledge except through
   Jesus Christ, for no man comes unto the Father but by the Son. But even
   if he could know God, in a measure, apart from the Revelation of Him in
   Christ Jesus, it would be a knowledge of terror that would make him
   flee away and avoid God! It would not be life to our souls to know God
   apart from His Son, Jesus Christ! We must know the Christ whom He has
   sent or our knowledge does not bring eternal life to us. But, Beloved,
   when we see God in Christ meeting us, demanding a penalty and yet
   providing it, Himself, decreeing the punishment most justly and then
   bearing it Himself. When we see Him to be both Judge and Expiation,
   both Ruler and Sacrifice, then we see that "herein is love, not that we
   loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the
   Propitiation for our sins." Then it is, in the knowledge of God in
   Christ and God through Christ, that we find that we have entered into
   eternal life!

   Let me add, here, that it would not be eternal life to know Jesus
   Christ if He were not God--if, as some say, He was only a good
   man--that He was only a good man is impossible, for He was the worst of
   impostors if He was not God, for He spoke of Himself as God! And if He
   were not Divine, then He imposed on men. If He were nothing but a mere
   man, how could He give us eternal life? And of what use were trust in
   Him? But if He who bled on Calvary was very God of very God, as well as
   Man, then the sacrifice He offered has an infinite value about it and
   I, even I, dare trust my soul to Him with the full assurance that there
   must be, in such a Savior, ability to save to the uttermost all them
   that come unto God by Him!

   How do we come to know Christ? I do not think it necessary, at this
   time, to explain much about how we know Christ, because I am addressing
   thousands of persons who do know Him. Brothers and Sisters, you know
   Christ in the glory of His Divine Person, God and Man. You have no
   doubts about either His Deity or His Humanity--you have tasted of the
   sympathy that comes to you through His Manhood, and you have felt the
   majesty of His Godhead--He is to you your Brother and yet your God! You
   know Him, then, in the glory of His Person.

   You also know Him in the peace-speaking power of His precious blood.
   This is, to me, the best evidence of the Truth of our holy religion. I
   was once troubled and tossed to and fro, driven almost to despair under
   a sense of sin--it was only when I understood Christ's substitutionary
   Sacrifice and realized that He stood in my place and bore my sin in His
   own body on the Cross that I obtained peace with God! I know the power
   of His blood by the peace it brought me! Do not many of you know it
   also? I am sure that many of you do. Whenever sin returns to assail you
   and you get troubled and perplexed, do you not go and look, again, to
   Christ upon the Cross, and all your anxiety disappears? The wounds of
   Jesus bleed a balsam that heals your wounds! And His death yields the
   life that delivers you from going down to death!

   We also know Christ in the perfection of His righteousness. By faith we
   have put on that glorious robe and we have gone in unto God with our
   Brother's garments on--and the Lord has accepted us for His sake--and
   we have come from the Divine Presence exceedingly comforted and
   blessed, "accepted in the Beloved." We know, dear Friends, now, what
   communion with God means. I have never seen Him, but I know Him better
   than anybody I ever saw! I have never heard His voice, nor do I expect
   to hear it till these ears are deaf in the grave, unless the Lord
   should first come suddenly, but I know His voice better than I know the
   voice of anyone on earth! I can discern it in a moment. A stranger will
   I not follow, for I know not the voice of strangers, but if there is
   any Truth of God uttered, I know that Truth by a kind of instinct
   within my soul. The charm of it is that Jesus has spoken it and it
   commands my immediate loyal acceptance. Question anything Christ has
   said? Brethren, if I find Christ contradicting everything that I ever
   thought of, or any decision I had arrived at, I would, without regret,
   fling every thought in my mind to the winds--and I would embrace each
   syllable that He has spoken with a joy most intense and a loyalty that
   never questions!

   I have heard of "life in London." I do not know much about what that
   expression means, but I know what life in Christ is, and there is
   nothing like it! Life in Heaven is only life in Christ--if He were gone
   from the realms of bliss, there would be no life in Heaven, itself--the
   center, the core, the soul of the everlasting joy of the redeemed lies
   in the fact of Christ being with them and their knowing Him! This is
   life eternal, to know Jesus Christ whom God has sent, and to know God
   in Him.

   This will give you life, you daughters of despair who are at death's
   dark door--know God and Christ and you shall live! This will give you
   life, you disappointed ones, to whom life seems to be like a sucked
   orange which you would gladly throw away! This will be the cup of life,
   again, and put into it the nectar of true life. This will give you
   something to trust in! This will give you rest to your spirit, this
   will give you power for service, this will give you a holy expectancy
   for the world to come! In fact, everything that life means comes to the
   man who knows God and knows Christ--and everything that death means
   comes to the man who does not know God, and does not know Christ--he is
   dead even while he continues to exist.

   I have finished all my discourse but for one fragment. Did you notice
   the last clause in our second text? "This is the true God, and eternal
   life. Little children, keep yourselves from idols." Do you see the
   drift of the Apostle's injunction?

   You live by the true God, you live by Jesus Christ--therefore, keep
   yourselves from idols. Idols are untrue gods and they are death to you.
   Therefore, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols."

   Of course, I need not say to you that we must carefully preserve our
   integrity in the matter of worshipping anything that can be seen. No
   child of God may dare to worship a picture, an image, or anything that
   is visible! I would like to break out of every church window every
   image of the saints, lest it should be worshipped--and especially to
   banish from all public observation every symbol and sign that ever has
   been worshipped in the Church of Rome lest they should be worshipped
   again! I see, in the symbolism of certain churches, a tendency to set
   up something visible as an object of worship. Remember the commandment,
   "You shall have no other gods before Me," that is, have nothing to
   worship but God, and then, next, "You shall not make unto you any
   engraved image, or any likeness of anything that is in Heaven above, or
   that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
   you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord
   your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon
   the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me;
   and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep My
   Commandments."

   The worship of the cross, the crucifix, the "consecrated" bread, or
   anything of that kind is sheer idolatry, and it always brings death
   with it. Gospel Light dies out when anything but the true God is
   worshipped. Therefore, away with idols! Have a holy iconoclastic zeal
   against anything that is regarded by men with the reverence which is
   due to God, alone!

   But keep yourselves from all other idols--from the idols of your own
   brain, from creeds of your own making, from thoughts of your own
   imagining. Keep yourselves from letting anything but God rule you. Keep
   yourselves from golden idols--keep yourselves from the love of fame--
   keep yourselves from the adoration of human science! "Keep yourselves
   from idols." There is no God but God and Christ Jesus, His Son, is the
   only Mediator between God and men. Keep yourselves from allowing
   anything but God to get the upper hand of you. Make not gods of
   yourselves, your own persons-- make not gods of your families, make not
   gods of your children.

   Verily, I say unto you, there are many who worship their children and
   set them up as little gods! And when they are taken away from them, as
   they will be when they worship them, then they cry out against God most
   bitterly. How could they think that God would allow the little Dagons
   to be set up in His place? It must be God first, God last, God midst,
   and God, without end! May He make it so with us that, from now on, we
   shall have this eternal life which consists in knowing the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM27.

   Verse 1. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? If
   all your light comes from the Father of Lights, with whom is no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning, you need not be afraid of
   losing your light! "The Lord is my light and my salvation." If your
   salvation comes from the God of Salvation, if it is worked out by the
   Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, you need not be afraid that you will
   ever be robbed of that salvation--and you may confidently sing,
   "Jehovah is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?"

   1. The LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? "He
   puts His own force into me and if He who is Omnipotent is the strength
   of my life, who can stand against me? If my strength were in myself, I
   might well be afraid, but if it is in God, alone, if, 'the Lord is the
   strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?'" Dismiss your fears,
   then, whatever may be the cause of them, all you who are trusting in
   the Lord Jehovah! The causes of fear are many, but the cure of fear is
   one, namely, faith in the living God!

   2. When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up
   my flesh, they stumbled and fell. This is the record of the Psalmist's
   past experience. David was a soldier and he had a soldier's dangers and
   a soldier's deliverances. And here he writes the history of his
   battles. These are dispatches from the field. When the Psalmist's
   enemies rushed upon him like hungry lions seeking to eat him up, they
   stumbled and fell! He had not to fight, or even to sound a trumpet, for
   the Lord fought for him!

   3. Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
   though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. The
   past gives him confidence both for the present and for the future.
   Happy is the man who can fall back upon his past experience, not to
   make of it a bed to lie upon, but to make of it a lever with which to
   lift his soul out of the Slough of Despond! I think I have sometimes
   said that we may use our past experiences as the bargemen use their
   oars when they push backward to drive the boat forward. You must never
   lie down upon past mercies and say, "I am satisfied with all that has
   happened," but use the past to help you in the present and the future.

   4. One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I
   may dwell in the House of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold
   the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in His Temple. David wanted to
   spend his days in the House of his God and we, also, may do the same,
   not only in the place that is used for public worship, but wherever we
   may be! The great House of God is everywhere and His children can
   always be at home with Him. That is the ideal of a Christian's life, to
   be always in God's House--

   "No more a stranger or a guest, But like a child at home."

   David desired not only that he might dwell in God's House, but that he
   might spend his time in adoring contemplation of the beauty of his
   God--"to behold the beauty of the Lord." Did you ever think of the
   wonderful beauties that there are in the Character of the Most High? If
   you want to see them, behold Him who is altogether lovely, in whom the
   Father is to be most clearly seen, though veiled in human flesh! This
   should also be our lifelong work, to study, to understand, and to enjoy
   the beauty of the Lord, "and to enquire in His Temple," not only to see
   Him, but to speak with Him and to hear Him speak. A Christian is one
   who makes enquiries of his God--he is an enquirer when he begins, and
   he should be an enquirer till he ends. The Apostle Peter tells us that
   the angels belong to the honorable company of enquirers concerning
   "things that accompany salvation." "Which things the angels desire to
   look into." Christian men should go to God with their enquiries and
   when they come to public worship, this should be one great end of it,
   "to enquire in His Temple."

   5. For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion.
   "For"--and this is a reason for dismissing all our fear--"in the time
   of trouble He shall hide me." "I am so little that I may easily be
   hidden away by One so great as God is. 'He shall hide me in His
   pavilion,' in His own royal tent and beneath the majesty of His
   Sovereignty my soul shall find perfect security."

   5. In the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me. "In that Most Holy
   Place where none can come and live but those whom God brings there! In
   the sacred spot where the security must be absolute! In the Tabernacle
   of Sacrifice sprinkled with the blood of Atonement, shall He hide me."
   Oh, what a hiding place is this for one who is in trouble!

   6. He shall set me up upon a rock. What perfect security the child of
   God has, first, in the pavilion of Sovereignty, next, in the secrecy of
   Sacrifice--and thirdly, on the rock of Immutability! "He shall set me
   up upon a rock."

   6. And now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me:
   therefore will I offer in His tabernacle sacrifices ofjoy; I will sing,
   yes, I will sing praises unto the LORD. If an ungodly man's head were
   lifted up above His enemies, he would begin to denounce them and to
   curse them. But when a Believer's head is thus lifted up, he begins to
   praise his God. Then are his songs louder and sweeter than they ever
   were before! "I will sing, yes, I will sing praises unto the

   LORD."

   7. Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and
   answer me. I thought you were going to sing, David, but you are at
   prayer, I see. This is how we live spiritually--we breathe in the air
   by prayer, and we breathe it out by praise! This is the holy
   respiration of a Christian's life! Prayer and praise must be mingled in
   a divinely wise proportion and then they make a sweet incense,
   acceptable to God. I hope we can say that we have never finished
   praying but that we feel we must begin singing, and that we have never
   finished singing but that we must begin praying! What a blessed
   interchange this makes for the whole of life! "I will sing, yes, I will
   sing praises unto the Lord. Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice:
   have mercy, also, upon me, and answer me."

   8. When You said, Seek you My face; my heart said unto You, Your face,
   LORD, will I seek. The child of God knows His Father's voice and
   responds to it. God's Word is like a seal and we should be like the
   wax, ready to take the impress of it. "Seek you My face." "Your face,
   Lord, will I seek." It is the same expression reversed, just as it is
   when the seal makes an impression.

   9. Hide not Your face far from me. I do not know why the translators
   put in that word, "far." It is printed in italics, but it should not be
   there at all! "Hide not Your face from me at all, my Lord. I do not ask
   You not to hide it far from me, but I pray You not to hide it at all!
   Make no break in my sunlight. Let me always see You--this is all I ask.
   Hide not Your face from me."

   9. Put not Your servant away in anger. "Put not Your servant away." God
   will not put away His children, but He does, sometimes, put His
   servants away. I know that this is often a prayer of mine. I wonder
   whether it is yours also-- "Dismiss me not from Your service, Lord." We
   may remain His children and yet we may scarcely be fit to be employed,
   any longer, in His service. Let this be your prayer as well as David's,
   "Put not Your servant away in anger."

   9. You have been my help. "Yes, that You have, O Lord! You have been my
   help."

   9, 10. Leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. When my
   father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up. There
   is a poor child and his father and mother have both gone away and left
   him. But the Divine Father comes along, picks the child up and clasps
   him to His bosom--"Then the Lord will take me up." It is a wonderful
   thing to be taken up by God! A man prospers in business and people say,
   "Oh, yes, he may get on very well, for such-and-such a great man has
   taken him up!" But how much better shall you and I prosper who can say,
   "The Lord will take me up"? If He has taken us up, what a wonderful
   Patron we have! There is no other like the Lord!

   11. Teach me Your way, O LORD. "I am only a child. Teach me, Lord. I am
   fatherless and motherless. Take me into Your orphanage and teach me
   Your way, O Lord!"

   11. And lead me in a plain path, because of my enemies. "Make my way to
   be very straightforward! May my life be such that I never have to
   apologize for it! May there be no places in it about which unpleasant
   questions can be asked! Lead me in a plain path because of my enemies.
   If they can find fault with me, they will do so and if they cannot
   rightly find fault with me, they will make up some accusation against
   me. Therefore, O Lord, 'lead me in a plain path because of my
   enemies.'"

   12, 13. Deliver me not over unto the will of my enemies: for false
   witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. I
   had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in
   the land of the living. Men say that "seeing is believing," but that is
   not true--believing is seeing! So David says, "I had fainted unless I
   had believed to see." It is by believing that we see "the goodness of
   the Lord in the land of the living."

   14. Wait on the LORD. I think I hear David say this short sentence to
   each one in this great assembly tonight, "Wait on the Lord."

   14. Be of good courage and He shall strengthen your heart: wait, I say.
   David says it from his own experience and thus, as it were, puts his
   name and seal at the end of the Psalm--"Wait, I say"--

   14. On the LORD. Everyone who has ever proven the power of prayer may
   use the same words as David did! The preacher certainly does and with
   the Psalmist, he exclaims, "Wait, I say, on the Lord."

"Out of Darkness Into Light"

   (No. 2397)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 27, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 13, 1887.

   "That You may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in
   darkness, Show yourselves." Isaiah 49:9.

   THIS, of course, is a prophecy of what the Messiah would do. The Lord
   Jesus Christ, when He came among the sons of men, was to open the
   prison doors and to say to the prisoners, "Go forth," and to those who,
   in addition to being in prison, were in a dark cell, shut away from the
   light, He was to say, "Show yourselves."

   What wonders Jesus Christ has worked! There are many of us who are
   living proofs of what Jesus Christ can do, for, when we were in prison,
   He said to us, "Come forth," and we are now free as the air, our
   spirits are buoyant and full of gladness and rejoicing! Some of us also
   sat in darkness--gloomy, thick, Egyptian night--but when Jesus came to
   us, that darkness fled away and now we walk in the Light of God as He
   is in the Light, and we have fellowship with Him, and with His Father,
   too, through the ever-blessed Spirit. Wonders of Grace belong to
   Christ! He has already worked enough to keep His redeemed amazed
   throughout all eternity with the splendor of the achievements of His
   Grace! Though He were never to work another miracle of mercy, He has
   already done enough to set all Heaven in amazement throughout all the
   ages that are yet to come, such a wondrous Savior has He proved Himself
   to be!

   The liberty which Jesus gives to prisoners is something very marvelous.
   To be a prisoner for life must be a horrible thing--to be immured in a
   dungeon for all one's days must be almost worse than death. Yet there
   is a slavery of the soul that is worse than wearing chains upon the
   wrist! There is an imprisonment of the heart that is far more terrible
   than being shut up within stone walls or iron bars. When Jesus comes to
   the soul, He delivers us from that direst of all bondages, fetches us
   out from that most cruel of all slaveries, the bondage of the spirit,
   the slavery of the heart!

   Then we are told that if there are any who are in a worse state than
   that of mere captivity, namely, in darkness as well as in bondage, the
   Lord Jesus Christ comes to them and says, "Show yourselves; rise, and
   come out of the darkness; hide away no longer, come forth into the
   light, and enjoy it." And when He speaks, His Words are effectual! When
   He says, "Come forth," they come forth, and when He says, "Show
   yourselves," they show themselves! He speaks and it is done, for every
   Word of Christ is the fiat of Omnipotent Love.

   Now I am going to try and deal with those who are, spiritually, in the
   dark, in the hope that the time has arrived when they are to come forth
   out of the darkness and to show themselves. My business will consist,
   then, in two things. First, I want to find out the characters mentioned
   in the text. And, secondly, I will repeat the exhortation that it
   contains.

   I. First, I have to try to FIND OUT THE CHARACTERS mentioned in the
   text--"Them that are in darkness." Some of them are here tonight--let
   me see if I can, with my Lord's gracious guidance, put my finger on
   them.

   I observe, first, that they were not always in darkness. She was a
   bright young spirit once, after a fashion--up to all manner of fun and
   levity. And he--I know him very well--he seemed to be everything that
   mirth could make youth to be, sporting like a butterfly in summertime
   among the flowers. It was remarked of him that he seemed to enjoy life
   perfectly and, certainly, it was his intention to do so, even if he
   shortened his days in the process--he dashed at the flame, even though
   he singed his wings! But, all of a sudden, there came a cloud in the
   sky, both to her and to him--I mean, to you. It may be that some time
   ago a death happened in the family, or sickness came, or if it was
   neither of these things, at any rate, the mind suddenly grew strangely
   quiet and a stillness came down upon the spirit. And with that
   stillness there fell a gloom over the whole being. The fun and levity
   which had been enjoyed before were like the bubbles and froth upon the
   cup--there was nothing substantial or real in them at all--so, when the
   man or woman began to think, the bubbles and froth disappeared and then
   life grew flat, stale, dull and unprofitable.

   What, do you think, were those thoughts that brought such a sobering
   influence into your life? They were somewhat like this--I can tell you
   about them from my own experience, for they happened to me while I was
   yet a boy. I thought, "I have not lived as I ought to have lived. God
   made me, yet I have never truly served Him. He is my mother's God, but
   I have forgotten Him. He is my father's God, yet I have never sought
   Him. Ah, me! What shall I do? God must punish me. He must punish me! If
   He does not do so, He ought to--He cannot be God if He does not act
   justly and I cannot, in my heart of hearts, reverence Him if He winks
   at my wrongdoing, for much wrongdoing has been mine. What is to become
   of me?" So I cried out in my agony and I struggled to be right. I
   thought it would be easy work to do that which would please God. I went
   to the helm of my ship and hoped to reverse its course. But I soon
   drifted into the old courses, again, and what I thought to be very easy
   I found to be extremely difficult--no more--absolutely impossible! I
   seemed soft as wax towards evil, yet hard as cast-iron or steel towards
   anything that was good! I could not be molded, or fashioned aright.
   Then I grew sad in soul and heavy of spirit--I forsook the ways of the
   mirthful and stole away from my companions that I might get alone. I
   read my Bible a great deal and the more I read it, the more the
   darkness thickened about me. Then I tried to pray and, ah, me, I know
   now that they were true prayers, but then it seemed as if my prayers
   were no better than the barking of a dog! I could not hope that God
   would accept such prayers as those--and so the darkness increased
   around me.

   I think I hear someone say, "Yes, that is my experience." So you are
   here, though your spirit is in the dark! I am right glad to meet you
   and while you are there in the dark, I give you my hand, for I
   sympathize with you--I know what this darkness means! You were not
   always in that condition, but I thank God you are now where you are.
   Perhaps you think me cruel to thank God for your misery, but I do, for
   this is the gateway into a joy that will be worth your having! This
   loss of the sham will be the finding of the real thing! This nailing of
   the counterfeit upon the counter will be giving you the minted gold
   that shall be current in the markets of Heaven!

   Beside this, a sense of sin has settled upon you. I know it did upon
   me. I ate my bread at the table, but I sometimes wondered it did not
   choke me. I walked the earth and sometimes I was under such a sense of
   sin that I marveled it should continue to bear me up. I thought of the
   wrath of God and it did, indeed, seem to me to be "the wrath to come."
   I thank God that I did not, in those days, hear any of those fine
   preachers who tell you there is no wrath to come and you need not want
   to meet with such servants of the devil, for his emissaries they really
   are. When my conscience convinced me of sin, I verily believe that if I
   had heard any of these men, I would have loathed them from my very
   soul! The arrows of God stuck fast within my heart and I knew there
   must be a wrath of God against sin, for I was angry, even, with myself
   on account of my guilt! If God had taken me to Heaven with unforgiving
   sin still within my spirit, I would not have been happy! I was utterly
   miserable and I felt that I must continue so unless, by a Divine
   miracle of Grace, some great change could be worked upon me. The
   conscience of man, when he is really quickened and awakened by the Holy
   Spirit, speaks the Truth of God--it rings the great alarm bell and if
   he turns over in his bed and says, "A little more sleep, and a little
   more slumber"--that great alarm bell rings out again and again, "The
   wrath to come! The wrath to come! The wrath to come!"

   The soul I am describing is in the dark and the darkness settles down
   in conviction of sin and, dear Friend--for I am speaking to you (though
   I do not know you, I am speaking straight at somebody--God knows
   who--who is in the dark), you have no hope. You go to hear sermons,
   longing that some Light of God may break in upon you. Some of you have
   been hearing the Gospel for a very long time, yet no Light has come to
   you. Why is it? One reason is because you shut out the Light of God.
   There are some of you who refuse to be converted--you are like sick men
   who, when meat is brought to them, refuse it. They turn against it, as
   the Psalm says, "Their soul abhors all manner of meat." I am not going
   to blame you, dear Heart, but I do deeply pity you, for I know that now
   you are hardly in your right senses, like the men at sea, of whom the
   Psalm says, "They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and
   are at their wit's end."

   You hear and yet you do not hear! You have had the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ preached to you, and very plainly, too, but you know that it is
   one thing to hold a lantern to a man's eyes and it is another thing to
   take the scales off those eyes and make him see. So is it with
   you--your eyes are covered with scales and you do your utmost to keep
   them there! You will not come to Christ that you might have life and,
   therefore, there is no star visible to you! There is not even the
   faintest rim of the new moon, much less is there any light of the sun
   shining upon you. You are in the dark and, at present, there is nothing
   to break through that darkness or to drive it away.

   Worse still, you fear future and eternal night. I think I hear you say,
   "I am afraid, Sir, that I shall die in the dark." I trust not, I trust
   not, for I have something to say to you which, I hope, may be God's
   voice to pierce that darkness and disperse it! It would be an awful
   thing, certainly, to pass out of this world without a hope, and to take
   the last dread plunge into the unutterable blackness without so much as
   a single spark of light to guide you on your way. And, since you may
   die at any moment--(remember how our friend was taken away, two
   Sabbaths ago, just as he entered this House of Prayer)--since you may
   die at any moment, see to it that you do not die in the dark! You have
   but one little candle--do not waste even a fragment of it, but use
   every beam of light it gives you--

   "While the lamp holds out to burn,

   The vilest sinner may return,"

   but if that lamp is once quenched, then will you be forever beyond the
   reach of hope, for the Gospel is not preached in Hell--where your soul
   will be found if you die unforgiven! Here, mercy is offered to you, but
   pass away rejecting it and you have sealed your doom forever!

   I am not going to dwell any longer upon the seamy side of my subject,
   because that might only increase your darkness. Yet I know that you
   would feel a kind of mournful satisfaction if I were to do so. Do I not
   remember how I read through the Book of Job and its blackest pages
   seemed suitable to me? How did I take to heart the language of Jeremiah
   in his Lamentations and how did I roll those unsavory morsels under my
   tongue again and again! But I rejoice to believe that it is to people
   in such a state as this that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is sent. Christ
   did not die to save the righteous, but to save the unrighteous!
   Salvation is not meant for men who are not lost, but for men who are
   lost! It is not because of your riches that Christ came, but because of
   your poverty--not because of your worthiness--but because of your
   unwor-thiness! He has not come because you do not need Him, but because
   you do need Him! And the more terrible your necessity, on account of
   the thick darkness in which your spirit is enshrouded, the more am I
   encouraged to believe that Jesus Christ has come to save YOU--yes, even
   you, for the text says--"To them that are in darkness, Show
   yourselves."

   II. Now, secondly, I am going to REPEAT THE EXHORTATION of the
   text--"Show yourselves." What does that mean?

   First, it means that you are running away from Divine Justice and that
   your wisest course will be to go and deliver yourself up. I have been
   thinking, several times this week, of that unhappy man who is believed
   to have committed a murder and who has been going from place to place
   to escape detection. What a miserable week he must have spent! How he
   must have trembled every time anyone looked at him! The sight of a
   policeman must be terrifying, indeed, to him. I know not where he has
   been, nor apparently does anybody else, but he is seeking to hide
   himself from the officers of justice. There was a murderer, some time
   ago, who escaped for a time from those who were searching for him, but
   what a wretched life he lived while he was hiding! Now to any of you
   who are trying to hide away, thus, God says, "Show yourselves; come out
   of your hiding place."

   "But what am I to do?" asks one. Give yourself up. "What? Give myself
   up to justice?" Yes, to Almighty Justice. Come and surrender yourself.
   Do you not know that you are not really hidden? God sees you wherever
   you are! There is no hiding away from Him! I might not ask you to give
   yourself up to your fellow man, but I do pray you guilty sinners, who
   do not like to think of sin and are trying to hide yourselves, to
   abandon that folly and come out and give yourselves up. "Give myself up
   to God?" you ask. Yes, that is the first thing for you to do--to submit
   yourself to God, to lie at His feet pleading for mercy! I have heard of
   one who found that his life was sought for on account of a frightful
   crime that he had committed. When it was announced that whoever would
   bring that man's head, even though he, himself, had been a traitor, he
   would be pardoned, he did a very sensible thing--he obtained admittance
   to the king and said, "I have brought this man's head and I demand to
   be pardoned, for I have complied with the condition mentioned in the
   proclamation." So he had, though it was his own head that he had
   brought and, somehow, the grim humor of the action seemed to touch the
   heart of the king, and he said, "Well, you must live."

   I want you to do the same thing as that criminal did--come to God, and
   say, "Lord, I am a wicked sinner. If there is a man upon the earth who
   deserves to be cast away from Your Presence, forever, on account of
   sin, I am that guilty one." Deliver yourself up to God, surrender at
   discretion! Say, "You must do with me as You will, Lord, but I cannot
   run away from You, nor do I wish to do so. I know that all the earth is
   but one great prison when You are seeking me, for You can see me
   anywhere. You can spy me out in the darkest night and find me in my
   most secret hiding place--therefore I will deliver myself up into Your
   hands. Do with me as You will." Now then, you that are in the dark,
   come and deliver yourselves up! Say, as Esther did, when she resolved
   to go into the presence of Ahasuerus, "So will I go in unto the king,
   which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish." I wish I
   might be privileged to bring you to that point! May the Lord, Himself,
   bring you there! In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom God
   anointed to save sinners, I command you who are in darkness to show
   yourselves, by surrendering yourselves now to your God, submitting
   yourselves unreservedly to Him! "Kiss the Son lest He be angry, and you
   perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little."

   The next way of showing yourselves is somewhat different--"Say to them
   that are in darkness, Show yourselves," that is, you are very lonely
   and you have been avoiding your best friends. You like to get away into
   a secluded corner and you do not care to be spoken to about
   religion--yet all the while you have the heartache and know not how to
   get it cured. To you who wish to be always alone, you who are so
   retiring, so nervous and so sensitive that you never speak to anybody
   about the sorrow you so keenly feel, thus says the Lord to you, "To
   them that are in darkness, Show yourselves." Come out of your
   retirement! If you cannot speak to any mortal man, yet speak to the
   Immortal Man, the Christ of God! Go and tell all your sorrows to the
   best of friends! You remember that we sang just now--

   "Jesus, lover of my soul, Let me to Your bosom fly."

   O you lonely one, I want you to speak thus to Jesus and to fly to His
   bosom and tell Him all that ails you! You cannot speak to mother, you
   say, dear girl? Then speak to the Lord Jesus Christ! "Oh, I cannot
   speak to my father!" says the boy. No, I have often found that children
   cannot talk to their earthly father, but you can go and speak to the
   Lord Jesus Christ! He will meet you in your little room. He will be by
   your bedside tonight! Get somewhere, alone, and say to Him, "Lord
   Jesus, I have not a friend to whom I can go for relief. Perhaps there
   are many who would be my friends, but I am so frightened and so timid
   that I dare not go and speak to them. Even when I go to the Tabernacle,
   I am afraid lest someone should talk to me about my soul." Speak thus
   to the Lord Jesus, first, and it may be that He will give you courage
   to allow some Christian person to converse with you and help you "out
   of darkness into light." Even if you have not courage enough for that,
   it shall be an all-sufficient help to you to show yourselves to the
   Lord Jesus Christ. Seek His acquaintance and if only like one groping
   in the dark you do but touch Him and lay hold of Him by faith, you will
   be saved! And in due time you will come forth into the light of His
   Countenance.

   Thus I have given you two meanings of the text, but I want, now, to
   tell you another--"Say to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves."
   This passage may be applied to you who are sick, who are concealing
   your disease. I want every man here who is troubled about the state of
   his heart, and every woman, too, to come and show themselves to Christ,
   just as they are, in all their sin. I remember a friend of mine who
   was, for years, suffering from an ailment that I need not name. And
   after a while his malady reached a very sad condition and he was most
   seriously ill. A physician was called in and when he had examined my
   friend, he said, "This ought to have been seen to years ago! Why was it
   not properly attended to before? Have you no doctor?" "Oh, yes! The
   doctor has been in and out of the house many times. He has been here
   almost every month." "Well, what did he do for you?" "Oh, he
   prescribed, different things."

   Then the physician asked, "But did he never examine you to find out
   what was the matter?" And my friend replied, "Oh, I always shrank from
   a medical examination!" "But," rejoined the physician, "you will soon
   be dead unless God deals very graciously with you--and if you had been
   examined and rightly treated, a few years ago, probably this mischief
   was then such a very small affair that your life might have been
   saved."

   Do you not think that such a thing as that often happens--that we are
   afraid of a thorough examination and do not want to know our real
   condition--and, therefore, it continues to get worse? Well now, I want
   you who are in darkness to come to God and to say to Him, "Lord,
   examine me thoroughly." Go and exhibit to the Lord your sins and your
   sores, yes, though they are putrefying sores! He is accustomed to
   seeing such things, therefore hide nothing from Him. Go and tell Him
   the tale of all your sins and your sorrows. In your prayers to Him,
   make a full confession of your sin. I remember one who used to pray,
   "Lord, pardon my sin," and he went over a list of a number of sins that
   he had not committed--but he used to say very little about those that
   he had committed! "I am afraid I take a little drop too much," he would
   sometimes confess, but he never obtained peace until he said straight
   out, "Lord, I am a hard drinker, I am a drunk--but by Your Grace I will
   take no more strong drink." Then he was delivered from the evil!

   If I were a priest and you were fools enough to come and confess your
   sins to me, I would not ask you to call a spade a spade, for some
   spades are better called by another name--but when you go to God, pour
   out all that is in your heart, confess all your wrong-doing!
   Acknowledge that you are proud and conceited! Admit that you are
   murmuring and rebellious! Confess that you do not want to be converted!
   Acknowledge that you have companions you would not like to give up!
   Confess that you are living in the practice of a secret sin! Admit it
   all! Show yourselves, exhibit yourselves to God just as you are! It
   will be a dreadful sight, but the Great Physician will then operate
   upon you with His wonderful power which cures and cleanses, too!
   Remember this text, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
   forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." You
   who are in darkness, show yourselves to God by a full and wholehearted
   confession of your sin--and a humble acknowledgment that you deserve to
   suffer His righteous wrath!

   Thus I hope I have, in another sense, put this matter plainly enough--

   "Say to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves."

   The next thing you have to do is to show yourselves as healed ones
   bound to confess Him who has cured them. If you believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ, then you are healed of the leprosy of sin! If you trust
   Christ, your sins are forgiven--but remember that this is the full
   Gospel message--"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." "If
   you shall confess with Your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in
   your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.
   For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth
   confession is made unto salvation." When the 10 lepers were cleansed,
   our Lord Jesus Christ said to them, "Go, show yourselves to the
   priest," in order that he might examine and see whether it was a real
   cure that had been worked, and so might bear testimony that Christ had
   healed the leprosy.

   Now, if Christ has saved you, you are required to come out and show
   yourself! Come to the Church of God, and ask to be admitted to its
   fellowship. "Oh but I mean to go to Heaven in the dark!" Do you? Do you
   expect to find a dark Heaven when you get there? "But," says one,
   "there are a great many secret Christians!" How do you know that there
   are? Did you ever know one? "Yes," says somebody, "I remember one."
   But, if you knew him, how could he be a secret Christian? I do not know
   whether there ever was a secret Christian! I will not say anything
   about that matter because I am out of the secret in such a case as
   that, but this I know, nobody has a right to be a secret Christian. Our
   Lord Jesus said, "Whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me,
   cannot be My disciple." "Lord," says one, "I am Your disciple, but I am
   going to take it easy on the sofa." "No," says Christ, "that kind of
   life will not do for one of My disciples, for he that takes not his
   cross and follow after Me, is not worthy of Me." You who were in
   darkness, if Christ has brought you into light, show yourselves! Stand
   forward and say, "Here is a proof of what the Grace of God has done--

   'I am the chief of sinners, Yet Jesus died for me'"

   and I desire to come out boldly and publicly to acknowledge what He has
   done for me! It is the very least that I can do to show my gratitude to
   Him."

   I have sometimes called some of you, who say you love Christ, but do
   not confess Him before men, "rats behind the wainscot." You just come
   out, as it were, to nibble a bit of cheese, and then go back, again,
   into the darkness. But is that the way that a Christian man or woman
   ought to act?--

   "Jesus! And shall it always be? A mortal man ashamed of Thee!" No! Let
   it not be so! You who have been brought out of the darkness, show
   yourselves and confess your Savior and your

   Lord!

   But I am going to carry the text a little farther. There are some young
   men here, perhaps some young women, also, who have been saved. They are
   no longer in the dark and God has given them Grace and talents--yet
   still they are hiding themselves away! They are chosen ones loath to
   take their place of service. Remember when Saul was elected king, the
   people could not find him. He was a fine tall fellow, who stood head
   and shoulders above the rest of his countrymen, and though they ought
   to have spied him out even if he had been sitting down, they could not
   find him. Where was he? Hidden away among the stuff. He did not appear
   to like that idea of being king, so he hid himself away, and the people
   cried, "Come out, Saul! Come out!" And they brought him forth and
   proclaimed him king.

   There are certain Brothers and Sisters whom God means to place where
   they do not want to be placed. There is one who ought to be a Sunday
   school teacher, but he is not willing. Where is he? Come out, Sir, come
   out! I must fetch you out from among the stuff. "Say to them that are
   in darkness, Show yourselves." There is a young fellow who ought to be
   preaching the Gospel--he made a very pretty speech, the other night, at
   the Mutual Improvement Society. He can speak well enough as a
   politician and if there were an election, we would find him talking
   fast enough. But he is dumb so far as the Church of Christ is
   concerned! Come out, Brother! If the Lord has saved you and if He is
   pleading for you in Heaven, it is time you began to plead for Him on
   earth! Perhaps it is for the mission-field that the Master wants you
   and, my Brother, my Sister, if it is so, the message of the Lord comes
   to you tonight, "You that are in darkness, hiding yourselves away, Show
   yourselves."

   And, mark you, our text also applies to persecuted ones who shall be
   acknowledged and honored of God. There will come a day when God's
   people, who have long been in the dark through persecution, slander and
   misrepresentation, shall hear the Lord speaking to them out of Heaven,
   and saying, "Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a
   covenant with Me by sacrifice." "Say to them that are in darkness, Show
   yourselves." What a change will come for God's poor despised people in
   that day! "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the
   Kingdom of their Father." And, "They that turn many to righteousness
   shall shine as the stars forever and ever." Oh, I know that they sneer
   at you and call you names--"a Methodist, a Presbyterian, a cant, a
   hypocrite." Stand fast for Christ and the day will come when He shall
   say, "You that are in darkness, Show yourselves."

   Lastly, these words also relate to dead ones called to resurrection. It
   may be that most of us shall go down to the grave before Christ comes
   and we shall lie--

   "In beds of dust and silent clay," and leave these poor bodies of ours
   in some cemetery or other. Perhaps in the depths of the sea, or far
   away in New Zealand, or in the United States or Canada, we shall leave
   our bones far from the spot where our fathers sleep. But there shall
   come a day when the silver trumpet of the Resurrection Morning shall
   sound and this shall be its note, "You that are in darkness, Show
   yourselves!" And out from the dark we shall come, the redeemed of the
   Lord, in Resurrection Glory! In the prospect of that day, I feel that I
   must show myself for my Lord now--I must come to the front and bear the
   brunt of the battle for the Truth of God! I must be bold for Christ,
   for He has brought me out of darkness into His marvelous Light and He
   deserves that I should not shrink away and hide myself!

   He who has prepared a crown of life for every faithful one, expects
   that you and I will be faithful even unto death, in the hope of
   obtaining that crown of life which fades not! Up, up, you who are
   hiding yourselves! Come out of the bushes in which you are skulking
   away! If Jehovah is God, serve Him! If Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ
   of God, acknowledge Him! If the Gospel is worth preaching, proclaim it
   with trumpet tongue! If the Church of God is for Him, be numbered with
   it and take your part in its service and in its suffering! God help
   you, and God bless you by this message which seems to me to come direct
   from Himself to you! You that are in sorrow, show yourselves! And all
   you that are cowardly, show yourselves! And God bless you, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH 49:1-17.

   In this chapter, we have not merely Isaiah speaking concerning the
   Christ of God, but it is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who here
   speaks concerning Himself.

   Verse 1. Listen, O isles, unto Me; and hearken, you people from far. It
   is very remarkable how constantly the isles are spoken of in this Book
   of Isaiah, as if it had been foreseen that, in these far-off islands of
   the sea, the name of Jesus would be greatly magnified. "Listen," says
   the Messiah, "O isles, unto Me; and hearken, you people, from far."

   1. The LORD has called Me from the womb; from the matrix of My mother
   has He made mention of My name. Christ Jesus our Lord was spoken of by
   the Spirit of prophecy from His very birth--and long before it--and
   when He did come into the world, and was born of the Virgin Mary, the
   stars of Heaven spoke concerning Him and guided the wise men from the
   East to the place where the young Child lay.

   2. And He has made My mouth like a sharp sword. There are no words
   anywhere so piercing as the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. When you
   are giving quotations from various authors, you need never write the
   name, "Jesus," at the bottom of any of His words, for they proclaim
   their own origin. "Never man spoke like this Man."

   2. In the shadow of His hand has He hid Me and made Me a polished
   shaft. In His quiver has He hid Me. The great weapon of God against sin
   is His Son, Jesus Christ! God has no such means of smiting evil, or
   effecting His purposes of love as His own dear Son! This is the
   "polished shaft" which Jehovah delights to use.

   3. And said unto Me, You are My Servant. Above all others, Christ is
   the Servant of God. He is a Son by nature, a Servant by His
   condescension, a Servant for our sakes.

   3. O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. It is very wonderful that the
   Redeemer should here be called, "Israel." It is not more wonderful,
   however, than that in another place His people should be called by His
   name! You remember those two passages in the prophecy of
   Jeremiah--"This is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR
   RIGHTEOUSNESS." and, "This is the name wherewith she shall be called,
   The LORD our righteousness." There, the people of God take their Lord's
   name! And here, Christ takes the name of His people and He deigns to be
   called Israel. Nor is this an unsuitable name for Him, for it is He who
   wrestled on our behalf and prevailed, even as Israel did at Jabbok.
   Jesus is a greater Prince with God than Jacob ever was! Well, then,
   does Jehovah say to Him, "You are My Servant, O Israel, in whom I will
   be glorified."

   4. Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent My strength for
   naught, and in vain: yet surely My judgment is with the LORD, and My
   work with My God. The Messiah, prophetically looking forward,
   complained that, during His life on earth, He seemed to labor in vain.
   The nation was not saved--"He came unto His own and His own received
   Him not." He wept over the guilty city of Jerusalem, but those tears
   did not put out the fires of vengeance! He entreated men to turn to
   God, but they did not and they would not repent. He seemed to labor in
   vain and spend His strength for nothing, and in vain.

   5. And now, says the LORD that formed Me from the womb to be His
   Servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, Though Israel is not gathered,
   yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and My God shall be My
   strength. Even though the Jewish nation was not yet gathered to Christ,
   His labor was not in vain. God will not suffer His Son to spend His
   strength for nothing!

   6. And He said, It is a light thing that You should be My Servant to
   raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I
   will also give You for a light to the Gentiles, that You may be My
   salvation unto the end of the earth. What a blessed word of cheer this
   is for us poor Gentiles! The favored children of Israel thought us to
   be little better than dogs. But, behold, we have been lifted up into
   the children's place! If Israel is not gathered, the Messiah has become
   a light to the Gentiles, and God's salvation unto the ends of the
   earth! Yet we cannot help fervently praying, "Oh, that Israel might
   soon be gathered to Christ!" Her gathering in will be the time of the
   fullness of the Gentiles.

   7. Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and His Holy One, to Him
   whom man despises, to Him whom the nation abhors. Who is this but our
   Divine Lord, Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ of God? These words are
   spoken of Him whom man despised, of Him who was despised and rejected
   of men, of Him whom the nation abhors, for that favored nation still,
   alas, abhors the name of Jesus of Nazareth and will not cherish towards
   the Christ anything but thoughts of contempt!

   7. To the Servant of rulers. For, though He was the King of kings, and
   Lord of lords, He submitted to be a Servant to the kings of the earth
   and obeyed the rules of human governors. Yet--

   7. Kings shall see and arise, princes, also, shall worship, because of
   the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and He shall
   choose You. The day is coming when He that was spit upon shall be the
   admired of all mankind! No more the crown of thorns, but many diadems
   of Glory shall rest upon His blessed head! And all men, with loud
   acclaim, shall salute Him as King of kings and Lord of lords!

   8. Thus says the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard You, and in a
   day of salvation have I helped You; and I will preserve You, and give
   You for a Covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to
   inherit the desolate heritages. It is the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
   establish all that is good--and cast down everything that is evil. He
   shall staunch earth's bleeding wounds and repair her wilderness wastes.
   Where He comes, flowers spring up all around His blessed feet!

   9. That You may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in
   darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their
   pastures shall be in all high places. When Christ leads His flock,
   wherever they go they shall feed. And even if He leads them to the very
   tops of the hills, He shall make the pastures grow there for them!
   There is never a place where Christ leads us but what it is safe for us
   to go there. The Shepherd's feet make pasturage for the sheep that
   follow Him--therefore, be not afraid to go wherever He leads you, but
   rather rejoice that He puts forth His own sheep and goes before them,
   for--"they shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all
   high places."

   10. 11. They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
   sun smite them: for He that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by
   the springs of water shall He guide them. And I will make all My
   mountains a way. Where, naturally, there could not be a way, on those
   pathless summits of the loftiest Alps, the Lord says, "I will make all
   My mountains a way"--

   11. And My highways shall be exalted. "I will throw up causeways." God
   will make a way for you to get at Him if you want to get at Him! If you
   are willing to make a way for God, He will make a way for you! The gulf
   shall be bridged, the mountain shall be leveled!

   12. Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north
   and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. "The land of
   Sinim" signifies China. Is it not strange that, in this Book, we should
   find mention of the land of Sinim, the country of China? God has a
   people there and they shall come to Him! I was delighted, last Tuesday,
   to meet with a Brother who had broken bread with us at the Lord's
   Table--he was a poor Chinaman, so he had helped to fulfill this
   prophecy--"These shall come from the west; and these from the land of
   Sinim."

   13-15. Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
   singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted His people, and will
   have mercy upon His afflicted. But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me,
   and my Lord has forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child,
   that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they
   may forget, yet will I not forget you. Will God ever forget His ancient
   people, the Jews? Never! They forget their God, but Jehovah never
   forgets His chosen people--"They may forget, yet will I not forget
   you."

   16. Behold, I have engraved you upon the palms of My hands. "I cannot
   work, I cannot even open the palm of My hands without seeing the names
   of my chosen people--'I have engraved you upon the palms of My hands.'"

   16, 17. Your walls are continually before Me. Your children shall make
   haste; your destroyers and they that made you waste shall go away from
   you. For God is full of kindness to His people, and cannot forget them.
   Oh, that they would never forget Him!

Mediation of Moses

   (No. 2398)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 17, 1887.

   "And the LORD repented of the evil which He thought to do unto His
   people." Exodus 32:14.

   I SUPPOSE that I need not say that this verse speaks after the manner
   of men. I do not know after what other manner we can speak. To speak of
   God after the manner of God is reserved for God, Himself, and mortal
   men could not comprehend such speech. In this sense, the Lord often
   speaks, not according to literal fact, but according to the appearance
   of things to us, in order that we may understand so far as the human
   can comprehend the Divine. The Lord's purposes never really change. His
   eternal will must forever be the same, for He cannot alter, since He
   would either have to alter for the better or for the worse. He cannot
   change for the better, for He is infinitely good--it were blasphemous
   to suppose that He could change for the worse. He who sees all things
   at once and perceives at one glance the beginning and the end of all
   things, has no need to repent. "God is not a man, that He should lie;
   neither the son of man, that He should repent," but, in the course of
   His action, there appears to us to be, sometimes, a great change, and
   as we say of the sun that it rises and sets, though it does not
   actually do so, and we do not deceive when we speak after that fashion,
   so we say concerning God, in the language of the text, "The Lord
   repented of the evil which He thought to do unto His people." It
   appears to us to be so and it is so in the act of God, yet this
   statement casts no doubt upon the great and glorious Doctrine of the
   Immutability of God.

   Speaking after the manner of men, the mediation of Moses worked this
   change in the mind of God. God in Moses seemed to overcome God out of
   Moses. God in the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus, appears to be
   stronger for mercy than God apart from the Mediator. This saying of our
   text is very amazing and it deserves our most earnest and careful
   consideration.

   Just think, for a minute, of Moses up there in the serene solitude with
   God. He had left the tents of Israel down below and he had passed
   within the mystic circle of fire where none may come but he who is
   specially invited. And there, alone with God, Moses had a glorious
   season of fellowship with the Most High. He lent his listening ear to
   the instructions of the Almighty concerning the priesthood, the
   tabernacle and the altar. And he was enjoying a profound peace of mind,
   when, all of a sudden, he was startled. The whole tone of the speech of
   the Lord seemed changed, and He said to Moses, "Go, get you down; for
   your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted
   themselves." I can hardly imagine what thoughts passed through the
   great leader's mind! How Moses must have trembled in the Presence of
   God! All the joy that he had experienced seemed suddenly to vanish,
   leaving behind, however, somewhat of the strength which always comes
   out of fellowship with God. This Moses now needed, if ever he needed it
   in all his life, for this was the crucial period in the history of
   Moses! This was his severest trial, when, alone with God on the
   mountain's brow, he was called to come out of the happy serenity of his
   spirit and to hear the voice of an angry God, saying, "Let Me alone,
   that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them."

   The language of God was very stern, and well it might be after all that
   He had done for that people! When the song of Miriam had scarcely
   ceased. When you might almost hear the echoes of that jubilant note,
   "Sing you to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and
   his rider has He thrown into the sea," you might quickly have heard a
   very different cry, "Up, make us gods!" And, in the presence of the
   calf that Aaron made, the same people blasphemously exclaimed, "These
   are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of
   Egypt." Such a prostitution of their tongues to horrid blasphemies
   against Jehovah! Such a turning aside from the Truth of God to the most
   gross of falsehoods, might well provoke the anger of a righteously
   jealous God!

   It is noteworthy that Moses did not lose himself in this moment of
   trial. We read at once, "And Moses besought Jehovah, his God." He was
   undoubtedly a man of prayer, but he must have been continually in the
   spirit of prayer, or else I could conceive of him, at that moment,
   falling on his face and lying there in silent horror! I could imagine
   him flying down the mountain in a passionate haste to see what the
   people had done--but it is delightful to find that he did neither of
   these two things--rather he began to pray! Oh, Friends, if we
   habitually pray, we shall know how to pray when praying times become
   more pressing than usual! The man who is to wrestle with the angel must
   have been familiar with angels beforehand! You cannot go into your
   chamber, shut the door and begin a mighty intercessory prayer if you
   have never been to the Mercy Seat before! No, Moses is "the man of
   God." You remember that he left us a prayer, in the 90th Psalm, bearing
   this title, "A prayer of Moses, the man of God." There is no man of God
   if there is no prayer, for prayer makes the man into "the man of God."
   So, instinctively, though startled and saddened to the last degree,
   Moses is on his knees, beseeching the Lord, his God.

   I. This, then, is the scene I have to bring before you, and my first
   observation shall be that NOTHING CAN HINDER A TRULY LOVING SPIRIT FROM
   PLEADING FOR THE OBJECTS OF ITS LOVE.

   There were many things that might have hindered Moses from making
   intercessory prayer and the first was, the startling greatness of the
   people's sin. God Himself put it to Moses in strong language. He said,
   "The people have corrupted themselves: they have turned aside quickly
   out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten
   calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said,
   These are your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the
   land of Egypt."

   This terrible accusation from the mouth of God, spoken as God would
   speak it, must have impressed Moses greatly with the awful character of
   Israel's sin, for, farther on, we find Moses saying to God, "Oh, this
   people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold." It
   has happened to you, I suppose, as it has to me, that in the sight of a
   great sin one has almost hesitated to pray about it. The person sinned
   so wantonly, under circumstances so peculiarly grievous, transgressed
   so willfully and so altogether without excuse that you felt thrust back
   from the Mercy Seat and from pleading for such a sinner! But it was not
   so with Moses. Idolatry is a horrible sin, yet Moses is not kept back
   from pleading for its forgiveness. It astounds him--his own wrath waxes
   hot against it--but still, there he is, pleading for the transgressors!

   What else can he do but pray? And he does it after the best possible
   fashion. Oh, let us never say, when we see great sin, "I am appalled by
   it! I cannot pray about it. I am sickened by it, I loathe it." Sometime
   ago we had revelations of the most infamous criminality in this great
   city which we cannot, even now, quite forget, and I must confess that I
   sometimes felt as if I could not pray for some of the wretches who
   sinned so foully. But we must shake off that kind of feeling and, even
   in the presence of the most atrocious iniquity, we must still say, "I
   will even pray for these Jerusalem sinners, that God may deliver them
   from the bondage of their sin."

   A second thing that might have hindered Moses was not only the sin, but
   the manifest obstinacy of those who had committed the sin. Moses had it
   upon the evidence of the heart-searching God that these people were
   exceedingly perverse. The Lord said, "I have seen this people, and,
   behold, it is a stiff-necked people." Poor Moses had to learn, in later
   years, how true that saying was, for though he poured out his very soul
   for them and was tender towards them as a nurse with a child, yet they
   often vexed and wearied his spirit so that he cried to the Lord, "Have
   I conceived all this people? Have I begotten them, that You should say
   unto me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the
   sucking child, unto the land which You swore unto their fathers?" He
   was crushed beneath the burden of Israel's perversity, yet, though God,
   Himself, had told him that they were a stiff-necked people, Moses
   besought the Lord concerning these obstinate sinners!

   Then, thirdly, the prayer of Moses might have been hindered by the
   greatness of God's wrath, yet he said, "Lord, why does Your wrath wax
   hot against Your people?" Shall I pray for the man with whom God is
   angry? Shall I dare to be an intercessor with God who is righteously
   wrathful? Why, some of us scarcely pray to the merciful God in this
   Gospel dispensation in which He is so full of goodness and
   long-suffering! There are some who profess to be God's people who make
   but very little intercession for the ungodly. I am afraid that if they
   had seen God angry, they would have said, "It is of no use to pray for
   those idolaters! God is not unjustly angry. He knows what He does and I
   must leave the matter there." But mighty love dares to cast itself upon
   its face before even an angry God! It dares to plead with Him and to
   ask Him, "Why does Your wrath wax hot?" although it knows the reason
   and lays no blame upon the Justice of God! Yes, love and faith together
   bring such a holy daring into the hearts of men of God that they can go
   into the Presence of the King of kings, and cast themselves down before
   Him even when He is in His wrath, and say, "O God, spare Your people;
   have mercy upon those with whom You are justly angry!"

   Perhaps it is an even more remarkable thing that Moses was not hindered
   from praying to God though, to a large degree at the time, and much
   more afterwards, he sympathized with God in His wrath. We have read how
   Moses' anger waxed hot when he saw the calf and the dancing--do you not
   see the holy man dashing the precious tablets upon the earth, regarding
   them as too sacred for the unholy eyes of idolaters to gaze upon? He
   saves them, as it were, from the desecration of contact with such a
   guilty people by breaking them to shivers upon the ground! Can you not
   see how his eyes flash fire as he tears down their idol, burns it in
   the fire, grinds it to powder, strews it upon the water and makes them
   drink it? He is determined that it shall go into their very
   bowels--they shall be made to know what kind of a thing it was that
   they called a god!

   He was exceedingly angry with Aaron, and when he bade the sons of Levi
   draw the sword of vengeance and slay the audacious rebels, his wrath
   was fiercely hot, and rightly so! Yet he prays for the guilty people.
   Oh, never let your indignation against sin prevent your prayers for
   sinners! If the tempest comes on and your eyes flash lightning, and
   your lips speak thunderbolts, yet let the silver drops of pitying tears
   fall down your cheeks--and pray the Lord that the blessed shower may be
   acceptable to Himself--especially when you plead for Jesus' sake!
   Nothing can stop the true lover of men's souls from pleading for them!
   No, not even our burning indignation against infamous iniquity! We see
   it and our blood boils at the sight, yet we betake ourselves to our
   knees and cry, "God be merciful to these great sinners, and pardon
   them, for Jesus' sake!"

   A still greater hindrance to the prayer of Moses than those I have
   mentioned was God's request for the pleading to cease. The Lord,
   Himself, said to the intercessor, "Let Me alone." Oh, Friends, I fear
   that you and I would have thought that it was time to leave off praying
   when the Lord, with whom we were pleading, said, "Let Me alone: let Me
   alone." But I believe that Moses prayed the more earnestly because of
   that apparent rebuff. Under the cover of that expression, if you look
   closely into it, you will see that Moses' prayer was really prevailing
   with God. Even before he had uttered it, while it was only being formed
   in his soul, Jehovah felt the force of it, otherwise He would not have
   said, "Let Me alone."

   And Moses appeared to gain courage from that which might have checked a
   less earnest suppliant--he seemed to say to himself, "Evidently God
   feels the force of my strong desires and I will, therefore, wrestle
   with Him until I prevail" It was a real rebuff and was, doubtless,
   intended by the Lord to be the test of the patience, the perseverance,
   the confidence, the self-denying love of Moses. Jehovah says, "Let Me
   alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume
   them." But Moses will not let Him alone! O, you who love the Lord, give
   Him no rest until He saves men! And though He should seem to say to
   you, "Let Me alone," do not let Him alone, for He wishes you to be
   importunate with Him, like that widow was with the unjust judge! The
   wicked man granted the poor woman's request because of her continual
   coming--and God is testing and trying you to see whether you really
   mean your prayers. He will keep you waiting a while, and even seem to
   repulse you, that you may, with an undaunted courage, say, "I will
   approach You! I will break through all obstacles to get to You. Even if
   it is not according to the law, I will go in unto the King of kings and
   if I perish, I perish! I will pray for sinners even if I perish in the
   act."

   And, dear Friends, there is one thing more that might have hindered the
   prayer of Moses. I want to bring this all out, that you may see how
   tender-hearted love will pray in spite of every difficulty. Moses
   prayed against his own personal interests, for Jehovah said to him,
   "Let Me alone, that I may consume them." And then, looking with a
   glance of wondrous satisfaction upon His faithful servant, He said, "I
   will make of you a great nation." What an opportunity for an ambitious
   man! Moses may become the founder of a great nation if he wills! You
   know how men and women, in those old days, panted to be the progenitors
   of innumerable peoples and looked upon it as the highest honor of
   mortal men that their seed should fill the earth. Here is the
   opportunity for Moses to become the father of a nation that God will
   bless! All the benedictions of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are to be met
   in Moses and his seed! But no, he will not have it so. He turns to God
   and cries to Him to bless the sinful people! It seems as if he passed
   over the offer that God made, sub silentio, as we say. Leaving it in
   utter silence, he cries, "Spare Your people and bless Your heritage."

   II. Now I introduce to you a second thought, which is that NOTHING CAN
   DEPRIVE A LOVING SPIRIT OF ITS ARGUMENTS IN PRAYER FOR OTHERS.

   It is one thing to be willing to besiege the Throne of Grace, but it is
   quite another thing to get the ammunition of prayer. Sometimes you
   cannot pray, for prayer means the pleading of arguments, and there are
   times when arguments fail you--when you cannot think of any reason why
   you should pray. Now there was no argument in these people, nothing
   that Moses could see in them that he could plead with God for them--so
   he turned his eyes another way--he looked to God and pleaded what he
   saw in Him!

   His first argument was, that the Lord had made them His people. He
   said, "Lord, why does Your wrath wax hot against Your people?" The Lord
   had said to Moses, "Get you down, for your people have corrupted
   themselves." "No," says Moses, "they are not my people--they are Your
   people." It was a noble, "retort courteous," as it were, upon the
   Ever-Blessed One. "In Your wrath You call them my people, but You know
   that they are none of mine--they are Yours--You did choose their
   fathers and You did enter into Covenant with them. And I remind You
   that they are Your chosen ones, the objects of Your love and mercy and,
   therefore, O Lord, because they are Yours, will You not bless them?"
   Oh, use that argument in your supplications! If you cannot say of a
   sinner that he is God's chosen, at least you can say that he is God's
   creature and, therefore, use that plea, "O God, suffer not Your
   creature to perish!"

   Next, Moses pleads that the Lord had done great things for them, for he
   says, "Why does Your wrath wax hot against Your people, which You have
   brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a
   mighty hand?" "I never brought Israel out of Egypt," says Moses, "how
   could I have done it? I did not divide the Red Sea! I did not smite
   Pharaoh! You have done it, O Lord! You, alone, have done it and if You
   have done all this, will You not finish what You have begun?" This was
   grand pleading on the part of Moses and I do not wonder that it
   prevailed! Now, if you see any sign of Grace, any token of God's work
   in the heart, plead it with the Lord. Say, "You have done so much, O
   Lord. Be pleased to do the rest and let these people be saved with Your
   everlasting salvation!"

   Then Moses goes on to mention, in the next place, that the Lord's name
   would be compromised if Israel should be destroyed. He says, "Why
   should the Egyptians speak and say, For mischief did He bring them out,
   to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the
   earth"? If God's people are not saved, if Christ does not see of the
   travail of His soul, the majesty of God and the honor of the Redeemer
   will be compromised. Shall Christ die to no purpose? Shall the Gospel
   be preached in vain? Shall the Holy Spirit be poured out without avail?
   Let us plead thus with God and we shall not be short of arguments that
   we may urge with Him.

   Moses goes on to mention that God was in Covenant with these people.
   See how he puts it in the 13th verse-- "Remember Abraham, Isaac and
   Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own Self, and said
   unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of Heaven, and all
   this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they
   shall inherit it forever." There is no pleading with God like reminding
   Him of His Covenant! Get a hold of a promise of God, and you may pray
   with great boldness, for the Lord will not run back from His own
   Word--but get a hold of the Covenant and you may plead with the
   greatest possible confidence! If I may compare a single promise to one
   great gun in the heavenly siege-train, then the Covenant may be likened
   to a whole park of artillery--with that you may besiege Heaven and come
   off a conqueror! Moses pleads thus with the Lord--"How can You destroy
   these people, even though You are angry with them, and they deserve
   Your wrath? You have promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that their
   seed shall inherit the land, and if they are destroyed, how can they
   enter into Canaan and possess it?" This is grand pleading! But what
   bravery it was when Moses dared to say to God, "Remember Your Covenant
   and turn from Your fierce anger, and repent of Your thoughts of evil
   against Your people"! O Lord, teach us, also, how to plead like this!

   Nor was Moses without another argument, the most wonderful of all! If
   you read in the next chapter, at the 16th verse, you will notice how
   Moses says to God, in effect, "I cannot be parted from these people!
   With them I will live. With them I will die. If you blot their name out
   of Your Book, blot out my name, also. If Your Presence goes not with
   me, carry us not up from here. For how will it be known, here, that I
   and Your people have found Grace in Your sight? Is it not in that You
   go with us?" See how he puts it--"I and Your people.. .You go with us."
   "No," says Moses, "I will not be favored--I will sink or swim with
   these people." And I think that this is how the Lord Jesus Christ
   pleads for His

   Church when He is interceding with God. "My Father," He says, "I must
   have My people. My Church is My bride, and I, the Bridegroom, cannot
   lose My spouse. I will die for her and if I live, she must also live.
   And if I rise to Glory, she must be brought to Glory with Me."

   You see, it is, "I and Your people." This is the glorious conjunction
   of Christ with us as it was of Moses with the children of Israel! And,
   Brothers and Sisters, we never prevail in prayer so much as when we
   seem to link ourselves with the people for whom we pray. You cannot
   stand up above them, as though you were their superior, and then pray
   for them with any success--you must get down by the side of the sinner
   and say, "Let us plead with God." Sometimes, when you are preaching to
   people, or when you are praying for them, you must feel as if you could
   die for them, if they might be saved, and if they were lost it would
   seem as if you, too, had lost everything! Rutherford said that he would
   have two heavens if but one soul from Anwoth met him at God's right
   hand, and, doubtless, we shall have the same, and we have sometimes
   felt as if we had a Hell at the thought of any of our Hearers being
   cast into Hell! When you can pray like that, when you put yourself side
   by side with the soul for which you are pleading, you will succeed! You
   will be like Elisha, when he stretched himself upon the Shunammite's
   son and put his mouth upon the child's mouth, his eyes upon the child's
   eyes, his hands upon the child's hands and seemed to identify himself
   with the dead child. Then was he made the means of quickening to the
   lad! God help us to plead thus in our prayers for sinners!

   There is one other thing which I think has hardly ever been noticed,
   and that is the way in which Moses finished his prayer by pleading the
   Sovereign Mercy of the Lord. When you are pleading with a man, it is
   sometimes a very wise thing to stop your own pleading and let the man,
   himself, speak, and then out of his own mouth get your argument. When
   Moses pleaded with God for the people, he had, at first, only half an
   answer. And he turned round to the Lord and said, "You have favored me,
   and promised me great things. Now I ask something more of You. 'I
   beseech You, show me Your Glory.'" I do not think that was idle
   curiosity on the part of Moses, but that he meant to use it as the
   great master-plea in prayer. When the Lord said to him, "I will make
   all My goodness pass before you," I think I see the tears in the eyes
   of Moses and I seem to hear him say, "He cannot smite the people. He
   cannot destroy them! He is going to make all His goodness pass before
   me and I know what that is--Infinite Love, Infinite Mercy--mercy that
   endures forever."

   And then, when the Lord said, "I will proclaim the name of the Lord
   before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will
   show mercy on whom I will show mercy," how the heart of Moses must have
   leaped within him as he said, "There it is! That glorious Truth of
   Divine Sovereignty! The Lord will show mercy on whom He will show
   mercy. Why, then, He can have mercy on these wicked wretches who have
   been making a god out of a calf and bowing before it!" I do delight,
   sometimes, to fall back upon the Sovereignty of God and say, "Lord,
   here is a wicked wretch. I cannot see any reason why you should save
   him! I can see many reasons why you should damn him, but then You do as
   You will. Oh, magnify Your Sovereign Grace by saving this great sinner!
   Let men see what a mighty King You are and how royally You handle the
   silver scepter of Your pardoning mercy."

   That is a grand argument, for it gives God all the Glory! It puts Him
   upon the Throne, it acknowledges that He is an absolute Sovereign who
   is not to be dictated to, or held in with bonds and cords. Shall He not
   do as He wills with His own? We need to often listen to the sublime
   Truth that thunders out from the Throne of God, "I will have mercy on
   whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
   compassion. So, then, it is not of him that wills, nor of him that
   runs, but of God that shows mercy." Out of this Truth of God comes the
   best plea that ever trembles on a pleader's lips. "Great King, Eternal,
   Immortal, Invisible, have mercy upon us! Divine Sovereign, exercise
   Your gracious dispensing power and let the guilty rebels live!"

   III. Now, in the third place, let me say that NOTHING CAN HINDER A
   PLEADING SPIRIT OF SUCCESS. The text says, "The Lord repented of the
   evil which He thought to do unto His people."

   If you and I know how to plead for sinners, there is no reason why we
   should not succeed, for, first, there is no reason in the Character of
   God. Try, if you can, to got some idea of what God is, and though you
   tremble before His Sovereignty and adore His Holiness and magnify His
   Justice, remember that He is still, first and foremost, Love. "God is
   love," and that love shines in all the Divine attributes! It is
   undiminished in its glory by any one of them. All the attributes of God
   are harmonious with each other and Love seems to be the very center of
   the circle. Let us never be afraid of pleading with God! He will never
   take it ill on our part that we pray for sinners, for it is so much
   after His own mind. "As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure
   in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and
   live." The Character of God is infinitely gracious, even in its
   Sovereignty. It is Grace that reigns, therefore let us never be afraid
   of pleading with the Lord! We shall surely succeed, for there is
   nothing in God's Character to hinder us.

   And, next, there is nothing in God's thoughts to hinder the pleader's
   success. Look at the text--"The Lord repented of the evil which He
   thought to do unto His people." I will, therefore, never be hindered in
   my pleading by any idea of the Divine purpose, whatever that purpose
   may be! There are some who have dreaded what they call, "the horrible
   Decrees of God." No Divine Decree is horrible to me! And it shall never
   hinder me in pleading with the Lord for the salvation of men. He is God
   and, therefore, let Him do what seems good to Him--absolute authority
   is safe enough in His hands. But even if He had thought to do evil to
   His people, there is no reason why we should cease from praying! We may
   yet succeed, for so the text has it, "Jehovah repented of the evil,
   which He thought to do unto His people."

   I will go yet farther, and say that there is nothing, even, in God's
   act to hinder us from pleading with success. If God has begun to smite
   the sinner, as long as that sinner is in this world, I will still pray
   for him. Remember, how, when the fiery rain was falling upon Sodom and
   Gomorrah, and the vile cities of the plain were being covered with its
   bituminous sleet, Zoar was preserved in answer to the prayers of Lot?
   Look at David--he was a great sinner, and he had brought upon his
   people a terrible plague, and the destroying angel stood with his drawn
   sword stretched out over Jerusalem-- but when David saw the angel, he
   said to the Lord, "Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but
   these sheep, what have they done?" So the Lord was entreated for the
   land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. Why, if I saw you between
   the very jaws of Hell, so long as they had not actually engulfed you, I
   would pray for you! God forbid that we should sin against any guilty
   ones by ceasing to pray for them, however desperate their case! My text
   seems to me to put this matter with astonishing force and power--the
   evil which God had thought to do was prevented by the intercession of
   His servant, Moses.

   IV. I had many more things to say to you, but I must leave them unsaid
   and conclude by reminding you, in only a sentence or two, that NOTHING
   IN THE MEDIATION OF MOSES CAN MATCH OUR GREATER INTERCESSOR, THE LORD
   JESUS CHRIST.

   Remember, Brothers and Sisters, that He not only prayed and willingly
   offered Himself to die for us, but He actually died for us. His name
   was blotted from the book of the living--He died that we might live. He
   went not to God saying, "Perhaps I may make Atonement for the guilty,"
   but He made the Atonement and His pleading for sinners is perpetually
   prevalent. God is hearing Christ at this moment as He makes
   intercession for the transgressors! And He is giving Him to see of the
   travail of His soul. This being the case, nothing ought to prevent any
   sinner from pleading for himself through Jesus Christ! If you think
   that God means to destroy you, yet go and pray to Him, for "The Lord
   repented of the evil which He thought to do unto His people." Thus may
   He deal in mercy with you, for His dear Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EXODUS32.

   Verse 1. And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
   the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said
   unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this
   Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not
   what is become of him. What a terrible speech to be made by the people
   whom God had chosen to be His own! "Make us gods. Make our creator."
   How could that be?

   2. And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are
   in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and
   bring them unto me. Poor Aaron! He never had the backbone of his
   brother, Moses. He was a better speaker, but oh, the poverty of his
   heart! He yields to the will of these idolatrous people and bows to
   their wicked behests at once!

   3. And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their
   ears, and brought them unto Aaron. Idolaters spare no expense--there is
   many a worshipper of a god of wood or mud who gives more to that idol
   than professing Christians give to the cause of the one living and true
   God! It is sad that it should be so.

   4. And he received them at their hands and fashioned it with an
   engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said,
   These are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of
   Egypt. This was an Egyptian idolatry, the worship of God under the
   fashion of an ox, the emblem of strength. But God is not to be
   worshipped under emblems at all! What a poor representation of God any
   emblem must be!

   5. And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made
   proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to the LORD. They were
   going to worship Jehovah under the emblem of an ox! This is what you
   will hear idolaters say--they do not worship the image, they say, but
   the true God under that image! Yet that is expressly forbidden under
   the Second Commandment!

   6. And they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings,
   and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to
   drink, and rose up to play. Lascivious games were sure to accompany
   idolatrous worship, for idolatry always leads to filthiness in some
   form or other, as if it were inevitable!

   7. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get you down; for your people,
   which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
   How startled Moses must have been when Jehovah said this to him!

   8. 9. They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded
   them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and
   have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These are your gods, O Israel,
   which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt. And the LORD said
   unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked
   people. Moses, perhaps, begins to lift his voice in prayer, and God
   says--

   10. Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them,
   and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation. "I
   will keep My promise to Abraham by destroying these rebels, and taking
   you, his true descendant, and fulfilling the Covenant in you."

   11-13. And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does
   Your wrath wax hot against Your people, which You have brought forth
   out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? Why
   should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did He bring them
   out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face
   of the earth? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil
   against Your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your
   servants, to whom You swore by Your own Self, and said unto them, I
   will multiply your seed as the stars of Heaven, and all this land that
   I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and you shall inherit it
   forever. What a brave prayer this was! Here is a wrestling Moses--true
   son of wrestling Israel--and he brings his arguments to bear upon
   Jehovah when He is angry! And, by God's Grace, he succeeds in turning
   aside the Lord's wrath!

   14, 15. And the LORD repented of the evil which He thought to do unto
   His people. And Moses turned, and went down from the mount. An unhappy,
   broken-hearted man, going from the closest communion with God, down
   into the midst of a wicked people!

   15-17. And the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand: the
   tablets were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the
   other were they written. And the tablets were the Work of God, and the
   writing was the Writing of God, engraved upon the tablets. And when
   Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto
   Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. Joshua had probably waited
   lower down and he met Moses in his descent. He heard with the quick
   ears of a soldier and his thoughts went that way.

   18, 19. And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for
   mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome:
   but the noise of them that sing do I hear. And it came to pass, as soon
   as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing:
   and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands,
   and broke them beneath the mount. This is he who had been praying to
   God and saying, "Why does Your wrath wax hot against Your people?" Now
   he is in deep sympathy with God and he is, himself, angry with the
   idolaters. He cannot help it when he begins to see their sin. Before,
   he had only thought of the people, but now he looks at their sin. When
   you see sin, if you are a man of God, your wrath waxes hot and you get
   into sympathy with that Holy God who cannot be otherwise than indignant
   at iniquity wherever it may be.

   20. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire,
   and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the
   children of Israel drink of it. See the power of this one man who has
   God at his back and God in him! While the people are dancing around
   their idol, he tears it down, grinds it to powder and says, "You shall
   drink it, every one of you." Why, there are millions to one--but what
   cares he about their millions? God is with him and he is God's servant
   and, therefore, they all tremble before him!

   21-24. And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto you, that
   you have brought so great a sin upon them? And Aaron said, Let not the
   anger of my lord wax hot: you know the people, that they are set on
   mischief. For they said unto me, Make us gods which shall go before us:
   for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of
   Egypt, we know not what is become of him. And I said unto them, Whoever
   has any gold, let them break it off so they gave it me: then I cast it
   into the fire, and there came out this calf. That was a lie, for he had
   made the calf and shaped it himself. Aaron had not any backbone, nor
   any principle--he could not be stout-hearted for God! What a poor
   little man he seems by the side of his great brother! How he shrivels
   up under the rebuke of Moses!

   25. And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had made
   them naked unto their shame among their enemies). Moses does not spare
   Aaron. He lays at his door the guilt of the great sin he had
   committed--"Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their
   enemies."

   26, 27. Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who is on
   the LORD'S side? Let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi
   gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them, Thus says
   the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in
   and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man, his
   brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. This
   is the man who pleaded for them on the top of the mount! See how he
   acts in the sight of their sin, by Divine Authority! He smites them
   right and left. Possibly, those who were slain were the men who refused
   to drink the water on which the powder had been sprinkled, or those who
   continued in rebellion against the Lord.

   28-30. And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and
   there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. For Moses
   had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon
   his son, and upon his brother; that He may bestow upon you a blessing
   this day. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
   people, You have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto the
   LORD; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin. I will be bound
   to say that this was said after a sleepless night. The people's sin is
   now so vividly before him that he begins to feel that God will be just
   if He punishes them and does not grant them any forgiveness. So he
   goes, once more, up that steep climb to the top of Sinai with a
   trembling heart--and with only a, "perhaps," on his lip.

   31, 32. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people
   have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if
   You will forgive their sin-- There he broke down, he could not finish
   that sentence!

   32. And if not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your Book which You have
   written. "Let me die in their place!" But God could not accept one man
   in the place of another! There is a great Substitute, ordained of old,
   but He is more than man and, therefore, He can stand in the sinner's
   place.

   33-36. And the LORD said unto Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, him
   will I blot out of My Book. Therefore now go, lead the people unto the
   place of which I have spoken unto you: behold, My Angel shall go before
   you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon
   them. And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
   which Aaron made. Moses had only half success in pleading for the
   people. They were not to die as yet, but God declared that He would
   visit their sin upon them.

"Your First Love"

   (No. 2399)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 20, 1887.

   "Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says the LORD, 'I
   remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals,
   when you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not
   sown.'" Jeremiah 2:2.

   THIS was the Word of Jehovah to His ancient people. He remembered the
   faithfulness and earnestness of Israel when the nation was first born
   and came out of Egypt under Moses--and went after God into "the waste
   howling wilderness." Alas, in later years, they would not obey, or
   trust, or rejoice in God! He therefore tells the Prophet Jeremiah to
   say to them that He remembers their better days--they seemed to have
   forgotten, "but," says the Lord--"I have not forgotten. 'I remember
   you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals.'"

   I. Using the text practically for our own profit, I make this first
   observation, that GOD REMEMBERS WITH GRACE THE BEST THINGS OF HIS
   PEOPLE'S EARLY DAYS.

   Some of us were converted to God when we were very young and we look
   back with pleasure upon our early days. But, whether we look back upon
   them with pleasure or not, God does, and He says, "I remember you, the
   kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals." Why does God
   remember and prize so highly the early piety of His people, their first
   faith, their first love, their first zeal?

   I think that it is, first, because all these were His own work. If
   there was anything good in us, in the early days after our conversion,
   the Lord worked it all! Remember Paul's questions to the
   Corinthians--"Who makes you to differ from another? And what have you
   that you did not receive?" If there was in you any light, or life, or
   love, it was the gift of the Spirit of God. If there was any
   repentance, if there was any faith, it was the work of the Holy Spirit!
   A man remembers his own work and God, the Holy Spirit, never forgets
   any of His work upon the spirits of men whom He forms anew.

   God also remembers with pleasure those best things in His people's
   early days because they gave Him great delight at the time. It seems a
   strange thing to say, but it is strangely, yet blessedly true, that it
   gave God great pleasure to see us repent. Those first tears which we
   tried to secretly brush away were so precious to the Lord that He
   stored them away in His bottle! That first faith of ours, though it was
   but the feeble tottering of a babe in Grace, was very lovely in God's
   sight. You know how mothers love to recollect the first words their
   children began to speak and the broken notes and strange tones in which
   they lisped their first childish sentences? Well, even so does God
   remember His children's early utterances which gave Him such pleasure
   when He first heard them. Let not any of you imagine that God is
   indifferent to your first prayers, your first praises, your first
   reformations and purging away of sin! No, He takes infinite delight in
   them all, for, "like as a father pities his children, so the Lord
   pities them that fear Him." Therefore, you can be sure that the things
   which gave Him such joy in your early Christian experience have not
   faded from His gracious memory!

   It is very sweet, however, to reflect that when God says that He
   remembers the love of our espousals, and the kindness of our youth, He
   does not mention the faults connected with our early days. Our gracious
   God has a very generous memory--we have often noticed this in the
   Scriptures. When the Lord and His angels came to Abraham's tent in the
   plains of Mamre, to give the Patriarch the promise that a son and heir
   should be born to him, Sarah turned eavesdropper behind the tent doors.
   It was bad manners on her part and when she had overheard what the Lord
   said, she disbelieved Him and laughed within herself. This was worse
   manners, still, on her part, to laugh at the Divine Prophecy, and when
   she was brought to book for it, she denied that she had laughed, which
   was still worse! When she laughed within herself, she said, "After I am
   waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old, also?" And the Holy
   Spirit, writing in the New

   Testament about her, does not say anything concerning her lie, or her
   unbelief, but He mentions the only good thing about her speech, which
   was that she called her husband, "lord"--"For after this manner in the
   old time the holy women, also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves,
   being in subjection unto their own husbands: even as Sarah obeyed
   Abraham, calling Him lord."

   Oh, the gracious goodness that spies out the diamond on the dunghill!
   There was but one bright star in all that murky sky, yet the Spirit of
   God saw it and moved Peter to write concerning it! That which was to
   Sarah's credit is recorded, while that which was to her discredit is
   blotted out. "You have heard of the patience of Job," have you not? The
   Holy Spirit is very careful to remind us, in the New Testament, of the
   patience of Job, but He does not say anything about Job's impatience!
   Yet the Patriarch cursed the day of his birth in a very bitter and
   wicked fashion and this might have been remembered to his shame, but it
   was not. Ah, our blessed Lord, when He forgives our sin, forgets it,
   too! But He remembers all the excellencies and all the Graces which His
   Spirit works in the hearts and lives of His people.

   Besides this, the Lord so remembers the best things of our early days
   that He recounts them. In looking back upon my first days with God, I
   can see much to deplore, much in which, as a young man, I fell very
   short of what I ought to have been. But God says to me, and to each one
   of you who are His children, "I remember you; and I do not remember
   your shortcomings, your blunders, your headstrong hastiness, your
   faultiness; but, 'I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love
   of these espousals, when you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land
   that was not sown.'" To my mind, it is very sweet that the Lord should
   so recollect all that was good in His people, in the days gone by, that
   He recounted it, and recorded it in His Word.

   Now, to show how strong is the Lord's memory of all that was good in
   His people at their beginnings, He gives a detailed account of it. He
   says, "I remember you, the kindness of your youth." Let us try whether
   we can remember how we showed our kindness to our God in our early
   days. We resolved, when first we knew the Lord, that we would live
   wholly to His praise and we tried to begin, almost as soon as we were
   converted, to do a little something for our Master. We did all that we
   could do with the little strength that we then had. It was not much
   that we could do, but, in looking back upon it, we remember that it
   seemed a great deal to us, then. We prayed very earnestly over it. We
   went to our work with much trembling--we were very diffident in
   ourselves, but we had a firm confidence in the Gospel--and we had a
   sweet hope in God that even we might do something for His praise!

   Now, perhaps, we go to our Sunday school class and forget to pray! We
   sit down, open the book and feel quite competent to teach. Possibly now
   we go into the pulpit and begin to preach. It is quite a matter of
   course with us--we have delivered so many sermons that we feel quite
   easy about our power to instruct the people--but it was not so at
   first. I can remember how my knees knocked together when I first
   preached the Gospel, for fear that I should not preach it all, and
   should not deliver my soul so as to be clear of the blood of all men!
   What sighs my sermons cost me--and what tears! And, surely, God
   remembers all this, for He says, "I remember you, the kindness of your
   youth. You were but a youth, but then your heart was all aglow with
   sacred fervor, your spirit was firmly confiding in your God, your zeal
   was burning for My Glory."

   Then the Lord adds, "I remember you...the love of your espousals." Oh,
   some of us did love God very fervently in our early days! I can
   recollect the day of my Baptism very well. At this moment it comes back
   to my memory--I cannot help remembering it because the text suggests
   that we should, each one, think of our first days with God. It was a
   summer's morning, the 3rd of May, 1850, and quite early, at the very
   rising of the sun, I was up, that I might have a quiet hour or two of
   prayer to God, as thus commenced my public life as a Christian avowing
   my faith in my Lord Jesus. Then there came a long walk of some eight
   miles or so to get to the place of Baptism at Isleham Ferry. As I
   walked along the country road, that week-day morning, with the birds
   all about me singing, oh, I did feel that I loved my Lord! My soul
   seemed to dance within me for very joy!

   My friends were not believers in Baptism as it is taught in the Word of
   God and, therefore, I was about to do a strange thing, for none of my
   family had thus confessed Christ publicly by being immersed in the name
   of the Sacred Trinity! I remember standing by the river's bank with a
   great crowd of people all around in barges and boats, looking on. And
   when I had walked some considerable distance into the stream to be
   immersed, and when I rose from the liquid grave, I remember how I felt
   that, if all the angels in Heaven and all the devils in Hell were
   gathered there, it mattered not one jot to me! I was Christ's and I had
   given myself up to be buried with Him, to rise with Him and to live and
   labor for Him as long as the Lord should spare me! That day my love to
   my God was bright, and warm, and burning--and that evening, at the
   little prayer meeting in the vestry, I, who had been the most timid
   lad, perhaps, in all the world, and never opened my mouth for my Master
   in public, before, ventured to praise and bless God vocally in the
   midst of His people and, blessed be His holy name, I have never left
   off doing so from that day to this!

   Many of you might tell a story of your early days which would be much
   more remarkable than mine. But whether there is anything in them to
   interest others, or not, God says, "I remember you, the kindness of
   your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after Me in the
   wilderness." Those were good days, blessed days, days of Heaven upon
   the earth!--

   "What peaceful hours I then enjoyed! How sweet their memory still!"

   And they also seemed to be as sweet to God as they were to us!

   You observe that the Lord speaks in our text of Israel's going after
   Him in the wilderness--"I remember you...when you went after Me in the
   wilderness.''" That was a grand Exodus when all the hosts of Israel
   that were in Egypt, without exception, took away all that they had and
   marched out into the desert! It was nothing but a wilderness; yet, when
   Moses bade them quit the flesh pots of Egypt, they all did so--"and the
   children of Israel went up harnessed (or, as the margin has it, "by
   five in a rank") out of the land of Egypt." Doubling up their
   unleavened dough and carrying their kneading-troughs in their clothes
   upon their shoulders, they went right away into the wilderness of the
   Red Sea, "in a land that was not sown," where they could never reap a
   harvest, and where it was only natural to fear that they might die of
   famine. It was bravely done of Israel, thus, to face the howling
   wilderness as Jehovah led the way in the cloudy-fiery pillar!

   Perhaps I speak to some of you who, when you became Christians, had to
   give up your employment, or to quit some evil trade. Perhaps you had to
   run the gauntlet of a workshop where everybody pointed the finger at
   you and laughed you to scorn. Some of you had hard times in those days,
   yet I will not call them hard, for you never had, in all your life,
   such joy as you had then! When everybody gave you an ill word, then
   Christ was most precious to you and your love to Him burned with a
   steady flame! I think that the happiest days the Church of Christ has
   ever had, have been her days of persecution! What joy the Methodists
   had when everybody mobbed them! What bliss the Covenanters experienced
   when the dragoons of Claverhouse hunted them like partridges upon the
   mountains! God gives an extraordinary measure of joy to His people
   when, in their first days, they, for His sake, can endure anything and
   everything that they may glorify His holy name!

   Now, whatever you may have suffered in the days gone by, the Lord says,
   "I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your
   espousals, when you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was
   not sown." God has a very lively recollection of the simple trust of
   His people when they began their Christian career, of their child-like
   confidence in Him, of their intensely earnest prayers, of their delight
   in His worship and of their readiness for His service! It is a thousand
   pities that this bright experience should ever fade, but whether it
   fades or not, God says, "I remember it."

   II. So now, secondly, I want to show you that GOD REMEMBERS, WITH A
   GRACIOUS PURPOSE, THE BEST

   THINGS OF OUR EARLY DAYS.

   He remembers them that He may make use of and honor us in our later
   days. There is many a man, now honored and beloved in the service of
   God, who would not have been where he is if he had not been faithful to
   God as a youth. And I believe that there is many a man who has missed
   his opportunity of serving God through not beginning well. Young man, I
   charge you, when you become a Christian, be out and out for Christ! Be
   true to your convictions through and through! Do not neglect the least
   thing that you see to be in the Scriptures, but determine to follow the
   Lord fully. If you do that, you will be the kind of man that God will
   use! There are plenty of young men who are pliant as the willow, they
   will bend to anything and anyone--and God says, "I can never make
   anything of them" and, though He saves them, He puts them in the
   background as far as His service is concerned.

   But if there is a young fellow who, from his very youth, is straight as
   an arrow, one who cannot be bribed, who must do the right and will
   carry out his convictions at all costs, yes, to the devil's face if
   necessary, God will say, "That man will do for My service, I will make
   use of him. He shall be a pillar in the Church in years to come." "I
   remember you," says the Lord, "the kindness of your youth, the love of
   your espousals and, therefore, I intend to use you greatly to My honor
   and praise, and to your own joy and honor, too."

   And, depend upon it, God remembers these early faithful ones for
   another reason, namely, to instruct them and to reveal Himself to them.
   "There," He says, "I would have taught that young man something, but he
   would not learn it, so he shall never know much--he will be only a poor
   fool all his life. I set a light before him, but he preferred the
   darkness. Consequently, he shall go on with just glimmer enough to get
   into Heaven, but a clear perception of My Truth, a deep joy in that
   Truth, he shall never know as he might have known it if he had, in his
   youth been faithful and obedient to his

   God."

   I believe that the Lord also remembers what we do in our youthful love
   and kindness, that He may sustain us in the time of trouble. Some poor
   child of God is in great distress and he cries to his heavenly Father.
   He does not dare to plead anything that he has done--that would be
   quite out of character for a child of God--but, for all that, God says,
   "I remember you; though you have very properly forgotten what you did
   long ago, and have wept over your many defects since your early days,
   yet I remember the kindness of your youth, and I will help you. I will
   be with you in the hour of your need, and I will deliver you."

   Especially do I think that this must be true in the time of old age.
   That is a sweet prayer of David, in the 71st Psalm, "O God, You have
   taught me from my youth: and up to now have I declared Your wondrous
   works. Now also, when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not."
   I know what many firms do, especially in these days when business is so
   bad and competition is so keen--they begin to weed out the men who must
   go. The head of the firm says, "There is old John, you see, he is
   between 60 and seventy--he must go." "But, Sir, he carried you on his
   back when you were a boy. He was with your father." "I cant help it, he
   must go. He is getting too old and we can get a boy to do his work."
   That is how men do, do they not? But that is not the way God does! He
   lets us remain in His employment when there is very little that we can
   do. We pray to Him--

   "Dismiss me not from Your service, Lord," and He says, "I will never
   cast you off."

   Once His servants, we are engaged for life! Once enlisted in His army,
   He will never drum us out of the ranks of the soldiers of salvation! We
   shall be His, forever, for He says, "I remember you." "I remember what
   you used to do when you could do it. I remember how you worked for Me
   when you could work for Me, and now that you are getting gray and old,
   and can do but little in your last days, I will uphold you and bear you
   safely through." There is nothing in our service that we care to
   remember, on which we can build any claim upon God--but yet, in the
   fatherly discipline of His great house, He remembers all that His
   servants have done and, oftentimes, He sends them cheer, comfort,
   strength and honor which He might have denied them had they been
   unfaithful to Him!

   Therefore I would encourage you who are beginning the Christian life to
   walk closely with God. Beware of little slips while you are young men
   and young women. A little awry with you when you are single may make
   much awry with you when you are married and when your children are
   about you. He who begins amiss in the morning of life will probably go
   the more amiss before that life comes to its nightfall. I would charge
   everyone whom my voice can reach to be quite clear about what his duty
   is towards God as a Christian and, once clear as to what it is, to go
   straight ahead in the performance of it.

   I am obliged to refer to myself because we must, each one, tell his own
   experience. Well now, upon that matter of Baptism which I have already
   mentioned--reading in the Scriptures, I found that Believers were
   baptized. I had never heard anybody preach about Believers' Baptism.
   When I read about it in the New Testament, I did not know another
   person in the world who thought as I did and I came to the conclusion
   that it did not matter to me whether anybody agreed with me or not--my
   duty was plain! If I was the only person who had found out the will of
   God, I was bound to obey it, for I believed it to be God's will that
   Believers should be baptized on profession of their faith--and I
   fancied that I should be the first person in modern days to make such a
   confession! That idea made no difference to me, nor does it now--if
   there was anything that was taught in the Scriptures which had not
   occurred to anybody else before, I should not ask whether any other
   person had or had not seen it!

   If God commands it, it is not for us to ask whether it is fashionable,
   or according to the order of other people, but to obey it straightway
   without a question! I have found, through life, that the habit of going
   by God's Word as far as I understand it, honestly and rigidly, and
   giving way to nobody, has kept my road pretty clear. At first, people
   used to get in my way. Then I drove along the right side of the road
   and if they did not move, I was obliged to run into them, or, if they
   ran into me, I could not help it. Now I find that they just let me take
   the right side of the road and go straight ahead! I should do that
   whether they let me or not--therefore I have got to be "a chartered
   libertine" in these matters-- permitted to do what I conceive to be
   right according to the Word of God!

   If a soldier, in any of our barracks, does not dare to kneel down to
   pray before his comrades, he will have a hard time of it. But let him
   once do it boldly and he can do it, again, after that! If there is any
   young man here who is in a house of business, and he says, "I will be a
   religious man, but I will be very moderate about it," he will have a
   hard fight of it, I know he will! But if you come straight out and say,
   "I am beholden to no mortal man as to what I shall do. I am only God's
   servant and if He bids me do anything, I raise no question about what
   others may say of it--the thing has to be done and I am going to do
   it," why, you will get respect before long! It is, after all, the
   easiest way to take the hardest way when that way is right! Up with
   your flag, man! There, let it brave the battle and the breeze, and all
   that may come to it--you will win the victory so!

   But to pop your flag up when everybody is out of the way, and then to
   stand and look through your telescope, and presently to say, "There is
   somebody coming, I must pull the flag down," and then, after a while,
   say, "It ought to be up, the gentleman has gone. He will not look at
   it--haul it up again! Am I not brave? Oh, but here comes somebody else,
   pull it down, John, fold it up and put it away till there is nobody
   about--fly it at nights when no eye can see it!" That is a dastardly,
   cowardly way of pretending to be religious which I hope none of you
   will wish to follow! Oh, that in early life you may bravely fellow your
   God! He will remember it to your credit and honor in the days to come!

   III. Now, lastly, and this ought to have been the major part of my
   discourse, GOD WOULD HAVE US REMEMBER THE BEST THINGS OF OUR EARLY DAYS
   FOR OUR REBUKE.

   Ah, you are not what you used to be--not so decided, not so joyous, not
   so faithful! What have you been doing? Ask yourselves a few questions.
   Were you not happier, then, than you are now? If it was so, then go
   back on the old track! If it was better with you in your early days
   than it is now, get back to the old quarters! Pray the Lord to restore
   to you the joy of His salvation! Why, Pilgrim, by this time, if you had
   held on your way, you might have been very much nearer the gates of the
   Celestial City! What a deal of time you have lost--and now you have to
   go back to that arbor where you fell asleep and lost your roll! You
   have to go over the ground three times--first an advance, then a going
   back, and then a going forward, again--yet once might have been enough!
   You have been very foolish and you have lost a good deal, but now, by
   God's Grace, since He says, "I remember you in better times," answer to
   Him, "Lord, I remember those better times, too, and, by Your gracious
   help, I am going back that I may have them again."

   For listen. Do you think you were a fool then? Why, you were up early
   in the morning that you might get to hear the Gospel! You used to get
   into a crowded place and stand in the aisle! Somehow you were not half
   as tired when you used to stand all the while as you now are when you
   sit! And the preaching--what wonderful preaching it used to be! I do
   not suppose that it was any better than what you hear, now, but still,
   it did seem all on fire, did it not? And those Prayer Meetings! And
   your own private devotions--what hallowed seasons they were! And the
   Bible, when you read it--how it used to shine out in letters of fire
   before your eyes! Were you a fool then? Were you deceived, do you
   think? If so, I do not wonder at your turning back! But if you were no
   fool, then, but a wise man, what are you, now, that you have gone away
   from all this blessedness? Oh, come back! I charge you, by the living
   God, return to the place from which you have gone astray! Do you not
   owe more to God, now, than you did then? You have come a good way on
   the road since then-- ought you to love Him less? He has blessed you.
   He has preserved you. He has forgiven you. He has manifested Himself to
   you. You have had some grand times when your heart has burned within
   you--you have sometimes had a taste of Heaven upon earth! Should you
   not, therefore, love Him much more than at the first? Oh, come back!
   Come back with tears of deep regret and give yourself, again, to God!

   For, look, you have already slipped a long way down. Why, looking up, I
   can hardly see how high you used to be! You were so near Heaven's gate,
   but you have come down, oh, so far! In the course of a year or two,
   more, if you keep on going down, you will be still lower! "The
   Down-Grade" is awfully easy--where will you soon be? I hope that it
   will not come to pass that you will be drinking the cup of the
   drunkard, or singing the song of the profane. "Oh, no!" you say, "I
   will never do that." I do not know. I am not sure. If a man were to
   fall off the Monument, when he had fallen some 20 feet, I do not see
   what is to prevent him from falling to the ground. Once begin to fall
   and who knows how low you may go? Oh, for a miracle of mercy to stop
   you in your dread descent! May God work that miracle and save you by
   His Grace!

   Do you not think, dear Friends, any of you who are losing your first
   love and turning from your first kindness to God, that you are sowing
   some ugly thorns for your deathbed? You may lie a long time, perhaps in
   sickness and weakness, and then it will be a wretched thing to turn on
   that uneasy pillow and say, "Ah, I did not serve God as I ought to have
   done! I did not live to God as I should have done." It is amazing how
   some truly good men will, at the last, trouble themselves about very
   little things. I knew a dear friend who used to have a church in his
   house. A number of Christian people met for worship and when he grew
   ill, the singing was too much for him. I think that it really was too
   much for him to bear and the doctor said that his friends had better go
   somewhere else on the Sabbath--and they did--and I think very properly
   so. Yet, when my friend lay dying, I had hard work to comfort him,
   "because," he said, "I turned the people of God out of my house." I
   said, "No, you did not! You were ill and it was not fit that they
   should disturb you when you were so weak. I think that you were quite
   right, my Brother." "Oh, no!" he said, "Oh, no! I shall never forgive
   myself for that."

   And he was whipping himself for it most cruelly. And I thought, "Oh,
   dear me! The many that I know who have not such a tender conscience as
   this dear man of God has!" Still, let none of us do anything for which
   we shall have to flog ourselves when we come to die. Child of God, act
   so that when you have to look back upon it all, though you know that
   all your sin is forgiven through the precious blood of Jesus, you may
   also be able to feel, "In this thing God helped me to do righteously
   and to serve Him with all my heart, and so now, when I have come to the
   close of the chapter, it is with devout gratitude for having been
   preserved in integrity and not with bitter regrets for having been
   unfaithful."

   Have you ever seen a waterlogged ship towed into harbor? She has
   encountered a storm and all her masts are gone. She has sprung a leak
   and is terribly disabled. But a tug has got hold of her and is drawing
   her in--a poor miserable wreck, just rescued from the rocks. I do not
   want to enter Heaven that way, "scarcely saved." But now look at the
   other picture. There is a fair wind, the sails are full, there is a man
   at the helm, every sailor is in his place and the ship comes in with a
   swing! She stops at her proper place in the harbor and down goes the
   anchor with cheery shouts of joy from the mariners who have reached
   their desired haven!

   That is the way to go to Heaven--in full sail, rejoicing in the blessed
   Spirit of God who has given us an abundant entrance into the
   everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! May you so
   live, my dear Brothers and Sisters, that you shall go into Heaven that
   way, with an abundant entrance! And may none of us be found among those
   who have so lived on earth that they will not be missed when they are
   gone--and who will only be welcomed into Heaven as those who are
   "saved, yet so as by fire"!

   So I commend these thoughts to you. Let our days be such that we may
   look back upon them with pleasure! And if they are not so, now, let us
   begin to look back upon them with repentance--and turn to God with full
   purpose of heart, for His dear Son's sake.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JEREMIAH 2:1-25.

   Verses 1-3. Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Go and
   cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying, Thus says the LORD, 'I remember
   you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you
   went after Me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown. Israel was
   holiness unto the LORD, and the first-fruits of His increase: all that
   devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, says the LORD.' God
   reminds His people of what they used to be in their first days, when
   they came out of Egypt. They had very sadly declined from what they
   then were. They were none too faithful to the Lord, then, but they had
   fallen back, even, from that condition! Does not this passage come home
   to some of you who are not, now, what you once were? May the Lord
   graciously speak through these words to your ears and to your heart, if
   you have backslidden from Him in any degree!

   4, 5. Hear you the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the
   families of the house of Israel: thus says the LORD, What iniquity have
   your fathers found in Me, that they are gone far from Me, and have
   walked after vanity, and are become vain? What faults have you to find
   with God, that you have left Him? What fault have you seen in the
   ever-blessed Christ, that your love to Him should have grown cold?

   6, 7. Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of
   the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land
   of deserts and ofpits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of
   death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man
   dwelt? And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
   thereof and the goodness thereof; but when you entered, you defiled My
   land, and made My heritage an abomination. It is a sad charge against
   anybody that he forgets the care that God has taken of him in the days
   of his poverty and affliction. When a man becomes rich and is
   surrounded by earthly comforts, it is a terrible thing that he should
   then forget God, or that, the more God does for him, the less he thinks
   of God! This is strangely ungrateful conduct, yet the children of
   Israel acted thus. They were better in the wilderness--though they were
   bad enough there--they were better in the wilderness than they were in
   Canaan, better on the desert sand than they were in the land that
   flowed with milk and honey! And there are some, nowadays, who were
   better in their poverty than they are in their prosperity--and some who
   were better by a long way in their times of sickness than they now are
   in their palmy days of health! Alas, that it should be so!

   8. The priests said not, Where is the LORD? And they that handle the
   Law knew Me not: the pastors also transgressed against Me, and the
   prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not
   profit. It is always ill with the people when the ministers go wrong.
   If the dogs do not protect the flock, but are dumb dogs that cannot
   bark, what is to become of the sheep?

   9-11. Therefore I will yet plead with you, says the LORD, and with your
   children's children will I plead. For pass over the isles of Cyprus and
   see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there is
   such a thing. Have nations changed their gods, which are yet not gods?
   But My people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
   God bids them go to the West, across the Mediterranean, to Cyprus, that
   is, probably Cyprus, or to go to the East, to Kedar, or Arabia, and see
   whether any Gentile nation ever changed its gods, which really were not
   gods. "And yet," says the Lord, "here is a people that knew the one
   living and true God, but they have turned aside to idols--'My people
   has changed their glory for that which does not profit.'" O Friend, if
   there is no truth in religion, I do not wonder that you give it up! But
   if you ever knew its blessed sweetness. If Christ was ever precious to
   you--if you did once enjoy the Gospel of His Grace--how is it that you
   have grown cold towards it and declined from its ways?

   12, 13. Be astonished, O you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid,
   be you very desolate, says the LORD. For My people have committed two
   evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed
   them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. To go away
   from the flowing fountain to the stagnant waters of a cistern is great
   folly! But to go and hew out broken cisterns that can hold no water,
   but merely mock your thirst, is madness of the worst kind!

   14. Is Israel a servant? Is he a home-born slave? Why is he spoiled?
   God made him to be His son, not His slave, but Israel went aside from
   God and so became a slave, being carried away into captivity by the
   very nation whose gods the chosen people worshipped!

   15, 16. The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his
   land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitants. Also the
   children of Noph and Tahaphanes have broken the crown of your head. The
   Israelites went and worshipped idols and then the very nations whose
   gods they worshipped invaded the land and broke the crown of their
   head, or made them bald, which was, to the Jews, a mark of mourning or
   of disgrace.

   17. Have you not procured this unto yourself, in that you have forsaken
   the LORD your God, when He led you by the way? You who are depressed in
   soul. You who have grown spiritually poor. You who are in great trouble
   of heart, lis-ten--"Have you not procured this unto yourself?" Did you
   not make the rod for your own back by going away from your God? It was
   well enough with you when you trusted in Him, but now that you have
   turned aside from Him, all these evils have come upon you! "Have you
   not procured this unto yourself, in that you have forsaken Jehovah,
   your God, when He led you by the way?"

   18. And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the
   waters of Sihor? "The waters of the Nile," or, as it may be read, "the
   waters of that muddy river." The Israelites had suffered so much during
   their long captivity in Egypt that one would have thought they would
   never have wanted to go near the house of bondage again--"What have you
   to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor?"

   18. Or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters
   of the river? You are trying to find pleasure in the world. You are
   going to the resorts of sin, to seek amusement there. If you are a
   child of God, "What have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the
   waters of Sihor? Or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink
   the waters of the river?" What are you doing there, Elijah? You have
   lost the comforts of religion by your backsliding--and are you now
   trying to make up for them by going into the world's gaiety? It will
   never do! You can never fill your belly with the husks that the swine
   eat. If you were one of the swine, you might do so--but if you are your
   Father's son, it is only the bread in His house that will satisfy your
   hungry soul!

   19-25. Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding
   shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and
   bitter, that you have forsaken the LORD, your God, and that My fear is
   not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts. For of old time I have broken
   your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress;
   when upon every high hill and under every green tree you wander,
   playing the harlot. Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right
   seed: how, then, are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange
   vine unto Me? For though you wash yourself with niter, and take you
   much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me, says the Lord God.
   How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? See
   your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift
   dromedary traversing her ways; a wild donkey used to the wilderness,
   that snuffs up the wind at her pleasure: in her occasion who can turn
   her away? All they that seek her will not weary themselves. In her
   month they shall find her. Withhold your foot from being unshod, and
   your throat from thirst, but you said, There is no hope--no--for I have
   loved strangers, and after them will I go. God compares His erring
   people, in the delirium of their sin, to these wild creatures that
   cannot be tamed, but are driven by their ungovernable passions wherever
   they will. Alas, that men should be so sinful that God can only find a
   parallel to them in the wild donkeys of the wilderness!

   See, also, what despair will do for its victims. When a man says,
   "There is no hope," then he feels that for him there is no repentance.
   When he believes that God will not forgive him, then he will not turn
   from his evil ways. "You said, There is no hope, no, for I have loved
   strangers, and after them will I go." God save any here present who are
   getting into the clutches of Giant Despair! May they know the true
   goodness of God and may that goodness lead them to repentance! Amen.

Number 2400--or, "Escape for Your Life!"

   (No. 2400)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 27, 1887.

   "Escape for your life." Genesis 19:17.

   THE Lord Himself said to Lot, "Escape for your life," although the
   command was sent by one of His chosen messengers. God has messengers,
   nowadays, and He still sends by them short, sharp, urgent, stimulating
   messages like this, "Escape for your life." This message was sent in
   love. God loved Lot and, therefore, He would save him from the
   impending doom of Sodom. I doubt not that this message of love was
   spoken by the messenger in very solemn tones. I do not know how angels
   speak, but I am certain that the very heart of the messenger was
   apparent in the message when he said to Lot, "Escape for your life."
   Whether he whispered it in Lot's ears, or uttered it in a loud voice, I
   cannot tell, but anyway, I am sure that it was delivered as it ought to
   be delivered and it had an immediate effect upon the man who heard it,
   for he was obedient to it.

   Now, it may be that God has designs of love towards you who are here,
   who, as yet, have never fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
   before you. Remember that the Gospel admonition comes to you fresh from
   God--it has been in this blessed Book for ages--but it has not grown
   stale! It still leaps from the mouth of God, filled with all its native
   energy, and though I who have to deliver it to you may not speak it as
   I would desire, for I am very feeble, I will at least speak it out of
   the very depths of my soul while I try to plead with every unconverted
   man or woman whom my message may reach--and this shall be the one
   burden of my pleading--"Escape for your life."

   I. Notice, first, that THERE WAS NO SAFETY FOR LOT WHERE HE WAS.

   He must escape from the doomed city. The angel did not propose to him
   that he should stop in Sodom and, beneath some sheltering arch, hide
   himself from the fire-shower. No, the message was, "Escape! Flee from
   Sodom! Escape for your life." So, to you who are unconverted, we can
   bring no proposals of hope if you stay where you are! We can hold out
   no hope to you either in this world or in that which is to come!
   Neither a lesser nor a "larger hope" do we believe in, apart from your
   laying hold on eternal life by faith in Jesus Christ! Stay where you
   are and you are doomed. Remain what you are and you must perish in the
   overthrow of that City of Destruction which God will certainly burn up
   before long!

   There was no safety for Lot where he was, so, let me say to you who are
   unbelieving and unconverted, there is no safety for you in unforgiven
   sin. It does not matter what form your sin has taken--whether you have
   been a profligate or a moralist--as long as the sin you have committed
   is unforgiven, there is no safety, for whether your sins are as
   scarlet, or, in your judgment, of a milder hue, does not affect the
   truth of what I say--you must be washed in the precious blood of Christ
   and pardoned through His great atoning Sacrifice received by faith, or
   else you will die in your sins and you will be driven to the place
   where hope can never enter! If you die with your sins upon you--where
   death leaves you-- eternity will find you! Once lost, you will be lost
   forever. So, there is no safety in unforgiven sin.

   And, further, there is no safety in unforsaken sin. No, you must escape
   for your life from every sin. The drunk cannot be saved and keep to his
   cups. The adulterer cannot be saved and indulge his evil passions. The
   thief cannot be saved and remain dishonest. The only salvation for you
   is salvation from your sins--and that is the salvation that we preach!
   How many would like to be saved from the punishment due to sin, and yet
   to be allowed to go on in the sin! But there is nothing of that kind of
   teaching in the Scripture! God did not send His Son to be the Excuser
   or the Minister of sin, but to be the Savior from sin! There is no hope
   for you if you stay in this Sodom--you must get out of it--you must
   clear right away from it.

   Perhaps you say, "I will change my place of residence. I will go from
   the slums of the evil city into the cleaner and more respectable part
   of it." I tell you that you have to come right out of it! You must
   altogether quit the region of sin. You must flee from the realms of
   iniquity or else you shall be consumed in the destruction of the city.
   Up and away from all sin! Up and away! Our cry is not, "Hide in a
   corner," or, "Shift into a better place," but, "Escape for your life!"

   Again, there is no safety in unbelief. You may say, "I do not believe
   this," but, as the Lord lives, before whom I stand, it is true! In my
   own heart, soul and conscience, I know that there is a Judge of all the
   earth, and that He must do right, and that the day shall come when He
   will execute vengeance upon those who live and die in sin, for He
   cannot wink at iniquity. It is not in the Nature of a holy God to
   suffer sin to go unpunished! You may shut your eyes to this Truth of
   God, but it is there. You may disbelieve it, but it is there. You may
   ridicule it, but it is there, and you shall, before long, know it to be
   so! You must come out of this state of unbelief if you are to be saved!
   There is no salvation in unbelief. "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved; he that believes not shall be damned." There is to be
   no flinching in this matter--I am not sent here to please you who do
   not believe, or to talk with bated breath, as though I sympathized with
   your unbelief. I denounce it as high treason against the majesty of God
   and, therefore, I cry unto you, "Repent and believe the Gospel," for if
   you will not, you must perish in your unbelief! "If you believe not,"
   says Christ, "that I am He, you shall die in your sins." There is no
   safety in unbelief and, therefore, we say, as the angel said to Lot,
   "Escape for your life."

   And once more, let me remind you that there is no safety in
   self-righteousness. If anybody here says, "Thank God, I am no doubter,
   I am no profligate, I am no open sinner," I am glad if you can
   truthfully say that, but still remember, if you trust in your own
   righteousness, you cannot be saved! You must come out of that condemned
   city or else you are a lost man. I spoke with one, this morning, who
   is, I believe, earnestly seeking salvation, and he said to me, "I have
   denied myself this, and I have cast away that." I was pleased to hear
   it, but I said to him, "You have denied these things to yourself, but
   have you denied yourself? That is to say, have you left off trusting in
   yourself!" The hardest self-denial is to deny yourself and get right
   away from all confidence in your own doings, feelings and everything
   that comes of yourself, for you might as well hope to be saved by your
   sins as by your good works! The road to Hell by human merit is as
   certain as the road there by human sin! If you seek to insult the
   Atonement of Christ by setting up your merit as though it were as good
   as that Atonement, or by trying to prove that you do not need that
   Atonement, you are just barring Heaven's gate against yourself! You
   must come out of that self-righteousness if you would be saved! My only
   cry to you is, "Escape, escape, escape for your life, for there is no
   safety for you where you are!"

   II. But now, in the next place, according to this message of the angel,
   IF LOT IS TO BE SAVED, HE MUST RUN FOR IT AT ALL COSTS--"Escape for
   your life."

   First, he must leave his former comrades. Have you any jolly companions
   who are not Christians? "They are bright, lively fellows," you say. But
   they are doing you infinite mischief--they are leading you away from
   God and His Christ! Break loose from them--"Escape for your life."
   Though they seek to hold you back, tear yourself away from them and
   even leave your garment in their hands, as Joseph left his in the hands
   of Potiphar's wife! "Escape for your life." Quit all evil company.

   Next, Lot had to leave his former comforts. For the sake of comfort, he
   had gone to Sodom and, doubtless, he had his house well furnished
   there. But he must quit it all. Probably it was that excellent house
   that made Lot's wife look back-- she could hardly relinquish all those
   nice things of theirs even for life, itself! Beware, when you are
   seeking Christ, that you do not let your money or your business stand
   in your way! It will be better for you to enter Heaven a beggar than
   being a rich man, to be cast into Hell! It were better for you to be as
   houseless as the most unpitied waif about whom the wintry winds are
   howling--it were better for you to die in a ditch and to be saved--than
   that you should live in a palace and yet, after all, be cast into Hell
   fire! I charge you, be ready to give up all things, if necessary,
   sooner than lose your soul. "Escape, escape, escape for your life!"

   Yet again, Lot must not stop to argue--and nor must you. You do not see
   the danger. You need more evidence. You have objections--to all of
   which my one solitary answer is--"Escape, escape, escape for your
   life!" You have not time for me to discuss your difficulties, now. When
   you are saved, it will be soon enough for us to argue out the moot
   points, but now, while the fire cloud hovers above your head, escape
   for your life! Yonder drowning man will not clutch the rope until I
   have explained to him the doctrine of specific gravity. O Fool, what
   have you to do with specific gravity when you are drowning? Lay hold of
   the rope and live! So, there are some who must have election or
   predestination explained to them, or the doctrine of the human
   will--they must have this, that, and the other opened up to them and
   made clear as daylight. I beseech you, do not be such madmen! Do not
   trifle with your souls, but escape for your life! That is the one
   business of the present hour--see to that, first, and let other matters
   wait awhile till you are in a fit condition to consider them.

   If Lot is to be rescued, he must, as men say, put his best foot
   forward. It is quite early in the morning, but before the sun has risen
   much higher, all Sodom and Gomorrah will be destroyed. You have already
   waited far too long, my unsaved Friend! Gray hairs are on you head here
   and there--why will you delay any longer? Did you not catch the solemn
   tones of our hymn--

   "Hasten, sinner, to be wise,

   Stay not for the morrow's sun"? We sang that line over and over again
   in the different verses--

   "Stay not for the morrow's sun." Oh, that God would, in great mercy,
   press that appeal home upon you! "Escape for your life."

   Lot must not sit down and take things easy--nor must you. Lot must not
   begin to crawl at a snail's pace and amuse himself by looking down
   every side street of Sodom as he leaves it--he must run from the doomed
   city and you, also, by God's Grace, must bestir yourself! You must quit
   your sin by repentance and lay hold of Christ by faith. God help you to
   do so! Oh, that my lips could speak the longing language of my heart,
   and cease to utter the feeble syllables that do not express half what I
   feel! How can words fully express the burning desires of a soul
   yearning over sinners? But if you become willing to be led, even by my
   feeble speech, to listen to God's almighty voice as He says to you,
   through me, His messenger--"Escape for your life."

   I cannot help, just by way of parenthesis, pointing out to you the
   contrast between the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the
   repentance of the Ninevites. At the command of God, Jonah went though
   Nineveh and this was all he had to say, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh
   shall be overthrown." Again, and again, and again, in bitter tones, the
   Prophet cried, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown"--and
   the whole body of the Ninevites sought for mercy and found it--with
   nothing to help them to pray but this, "Who can tell if God will turn
   and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?"
   Now, if you have nothing better to comfort you than this, "Who can
   tell?"--

   "'Perhaps He will admit my plea,

   Perhaps will hear my prayer,'"

   why, you have good ground to go upon in approaching your God! But,
   Friends, you are not under such a dispensation as were the Ninevites--I
   have not to cry to you, "Yet forty days, and you shall be destroyed." I
   have to tell you that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners
   and that whoever believes in Him has everlasting life! I have to
   entreat and beseech you to lay hold on eternal life by believing in the
   Lord Jesus. Oh, how you ought to welcome such a message as that!

   If there is anybody whom I am addressing who is actually marked for
   death and who knows that he carries about in his body that which must,
   in a very short time, bring him to the grave. One who is well aware
   that he cannot recover from the incurable disease that has seized
   him--yet, even that should not hinder him from seeking God's
   face--rather it should move him at once to turn to Jesus! I can see a
   man before me now--my mind's eye can see him and I know that he must
   die, I am sure of it. Poor wretch, he has been a thief! His hands and
   both his feet are nailed up, they are bleeding from the cruel nails
   and, within a short time, he must die in agony. Yet I hear him cry out,
   as he turns his eyes on the crucified Jesus Christ, "Lord, remember
   me!" He is nearly dead and almost in Hell, but he cries, "Lord,
   remember me," and he is saved--and today is with Christ in Paradise!

   Now, you who have a cancer, you who are sick and ill, you who are poor
   and broken down and feel as if you must soon die, you who are as great
   a sinner as the dying thief was, say to Jesus, "Lord, remember me," and
   He will remember you! There is no reason under the earth, nor on the
   earth, nor in Heaven, itself--there is no supposable reason why you
   should not pray! And if you pray and seek the Lord's face, you shall
   not come to Him in vain, for He has said, "Him that comes to Me, I will
   in no wise cast out." God help you to come, now, for the Lord Jesus
   Christ's sake!

   III. Now, to conclude, let me remind you that LOT HAD EVERYTHING AT
   STAKE and, therefore, the angel said to him, "Escape for your life."

   Suppose he had stayed in Sodom--then he would have lost all. He would
   not have saved his furniture, or his gold, or his silver--he would have
   lost all that he had. Suppose you stop your sin--will you really save
   anything by it? "I shall save myself from thought," says one. Oh, but
   do you think you are an ox, or a donkey, that thought should be trouble
   to you? Why, it surely will be your wisdom to addict yourself to the
   most sedulous care about your eternal interests! Suppose there should
   be a cry of, "Fire!" raised in this house, tonight, as there was but a
   little while ago in Spitalfields-- how many there are who would rush to
   the doors in a mad panic to escape for their lives! Yet, surely, the
   soul's life, the eternal life, is more precious than the life of the
   body! Will you not make that the first point to be considered and
   set-tled--for, if you could by sin gain the whole world--yet what would
   it profit you when you would lose your own soul?

   Again, if Lot had not fled out of Sodom, he would, himself, have
   perished. Not merely would his garments have been burnt, but he would
   have perished. Not only would his gold and his silver have melted in
   the fire, but he would have perished. That was a true saying, though
   Satan uttered it, "Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has will he give
   for his life." And all that a man has he ought to give for his soul,
   for the immortal part of his being, for his higher and better nature!
   Why, if your soul is cast into Hell, it would have been better for you
   that you had never been born! If you neglect the Great Salvation and
   you die and perish in your iniquity, you have lost everything! You are
   not merely like a bankrupt who has lost his gold, but you have lost
   yourself! I beseech you, therefore, listen to me as I cry to you, in my
   Master's name, "'Escape for your life,' your immortal life, which is
   now in imminent danger!" Your existence will continue whether you are
   lost or saved, but your life! Have you yet received eternal life at the
   hands of God? Your life! Will you be content to lose it and to perish
   in your sin?

   The worst point about this story is that if Lot had not escaped, he
   would have perished with the men of Sodom. He could not endure them--he
   was vexed with their filthy conversation! How horrible, then, would it
   have been for him to perish with them! I cannot bear to think that some
   of you upright, moral people may yet be lost! You were never drunks,
   and yet you will perish with the drunk unless you repent and trust in
   Jesus! You were never swearers, but you will be as surely damned as the
   blasphemers will be unless you come to Christ! You cannot bear impurity
   or filthy language--there is much about you that is most amiable and
   excellent--but even to you, the Savior says, "You must be born again."
   And if you are not born again, if you have no faith in Christ, if you
   are not converted so as to become as little children, you will as
   surely perish as will the worst of men!

   You sometimes read in the newspaper a horrible story of vice and crime
   and you wish that it had never been printed, and I wish the same. But
   what must it be for you to be shut up forever with such as those who
   commit these unmentionable abominations? Yet there are but two places
   for man's eternal abode--Heaven and Hell--and if you are not saved so
   as to go to Heaven, where can you go but into the same pit with all the
   multitude of transgressors who shall perish in their sins? I wish that
   you who are outwardly moral and upright would think of this Truth of
   God. It seems to me as if I ought not to further press it upon you, for
   you are reasonable beings, you are not shut up in Bedlam. I pray you,
   therefore, run no longer such fearful risks as you have run up to now,
   but escape for your lives.

   If Lot had been destroyed in the overthrow of Sodom, there would have
   been one thing about him which there would not have been about the race
   of the Sodomites, he would have perished after having been warned. When
   the fire-flakes began to fall and Lot felt the terrible burning, he
   would have had this barbed dart driven into his heart--"I was told to
   escape. I was taken outside the city gate. I was led to a place of
   vantage and charged to escape for my life. Nobody else had that
   opportunity--nobody else in these cities was called, thus, to escape! I
   had a special appeal made to me by the messenger of God, and I refused
   it and, therefore, I shall die a self-murderer, having chosen my own
   delusions." O Sirs, O Sirs, if you go from this Tabernacle to Hell, it
   shall be hard work for you! If you perish, I will be clear of your
   blood. As long as this voice can speak, I will plead with you that you
   do not destroy yourselves!

   Look at the myriads of Africa, and the millions in China and India who
   have never heard the Gospel! I leave their future in the hands of God,
   all merciful, but they cannot enter Heaven! Neither can you! But there
   will be this about your doom, that you had the means of Grace--you had
   the invitations of mercy, you had the expostulations of God's Word! And
   you chose--you resolutely chose--to put eternal life far from you! O
   God, You who have made these men and women, if they have lost their
   reason, give it back to them and may Your sweet Spirit teach them, now,
   to judge righteously! And may they at once count it to be inevitable
   that every wise man should escape for his life and flee from the wrath
   to come!

   I shall not detain you much longer, for surely I have said enough. Only
   this much must be added before I close. There was a special favor in
   the case of Lot, for Abraham had prayed for him. I should not wonder if
   some here present are receiving a warning from me just now because
   someone else has been praying for them. Abraham had prayed for Sodom
   and, of course, especially for Lot and, therefore, God's messenger must
   go to bring Lot out of the doomed city. At this moment, while I am
   speaking, your mother is praying for you. While I am preaching, your
   wife is praying for you. Some of you have been made the subjects of
   special and particular prayer--you know that it is so! She who is now
   in Heaven never ceased to pray for you as long as she was here--and her
   many prayers--shall they not be now answered? They are undying prayers,
   though she who breathed them has long been dead--they still live in the
   Presence of God! Has He not sent His messenger, on that account, to
   bring you out of the City of Destruction? Here! Here! Let me grasp your
   hand and let us, together, flee from the wrath to come and run to
   yonder Cross where there is safety, for none ever looked to the Christ
   that bled thereon and looked in vain! I feel impressed that there are
   some persons to whom this message is a peculiar answer to very special
   prayers that have gone up to God on their behalf.

   This message will, I trust, come to them as a special warning, as the
   Lord's messengers reached Lot in a mysterious way. How came those
   angels in Sodom to tell Lot to escape for his life? How very oddly
   people are brought where the message of salvation is proclaimed! You
   did not intend to be in the Tabernacle, tonight, did you? You had an
   engagement to be somewhere else, but here you are, and you have never
   been here before! Yesterday you would not even have dreamt of being
   here tonight--but here you are! To what end are you here? God has, in a
   mysterious way, brought you here to look in the face of this man who
   cares for your soul and who says to you in the name of God, "I beseech
   you, escape for your life!"

   Then, again, this message came to Lot at a special time--on the morning
   in which the city was to be destroyed. An hour later, it would have
   been too late. I sometimes feel an awful solemnity creeping over me as
   I stand in this place, because I know many things which I cannot tell
   you about the strange way in which God speaks here. You remember that
   just before I went away for my rest, I told you the story of the
   godless young man who left his father's house? He was going to
   Australia, followed by his parents' prayers. It was Sunday night--he
   was about to sail on Wednesday and he thought that he would spend the
   Sunday evening here in this house, as he knew that it would please his
   mother. Better, still, it pleased God that night to touch his heart
   and, we trust, to save his soul!

   I put into the "Personal Notes" in The Sword and the Trowel for
   December, the letter that he wrote home to his parents telling them how
   God had met with their prodigal boy. That letter reached them only a
   few hours before a telegram arrived, saying that the vessel had been
   run into at Graves End and the young man and five others had been
   drowned! Oh, what a mercy that, just a few hours before he had to meet
   his God, his God met with him! I may be speaking to some others who are
   in just the same position, just on the borders of eternity--I cannot
   tell. You know that it is but two or three Sunday nights ago since one
   of our Brothers sat over yonder, in the last pew in the middle. He came
   into the Tabernacle, covered his face for prayer, and immediately died.
   We had to delay the service, you remember, while he was quietly carried
   away.

   He was a child of God, but suppose it had been some of you? Suppose it
   were some of you tonight? What would become of you? God save you even
   now! Do not run any more risks. There is but a step between you and
   death, a step between you and Hell if you are unbelievers! Therefore,
   escape for your lives, and escape tonight--

   "Stay not for the morrow's sun." God help you to have done with
   delaying and to feel that you must and will run away to the Lord Jesus
   Christ at once! Put your soul into His hands and if you do, He gives
   you this guarantee , "None shall pluck you from My hands." Your soul
   will be safe enough in His keeping! If I take my money to the bank, it
   is credited to my account. What do I do, then? Do I loaf about and, at
   last say to the clerk, "Is that money safe?" He would think that my
   mind was a little wandering!

   Sometime ago there was a bank in France to which there came a man who
   had put in some thousand francs or so, and he said to the banker, "Have
   you got my thousand francs?" "Yes, certainly. Do you want the money?"
   "I should like to see it," he said. "Well, here is a thousand francs,"
   and he laid them down before him on the counter. "Thank you," he said,
   "I do not know that I want to take the cash, now--it is there, alright,
   so I am satisfied." The next morning, he came in again and he wanted,
   once more, to see his money. I believe that the banker cut the
   connection and told him that he did not need such a customer as that to
   bank with him. If he could not trust the banker with his money, he had
   better take it home with him.

   Now, if you cannot trust Christ with your souls, go and save
   yourselves! But if you can trust Christ, put away all those foolish
   doubts, fears and anxieties, and say--

   "Firm as His throne His promise stands, And He can wel secure What I've
   committed to His hands Till the decisive hour! Then will He own my
   worthless name Before His Father's face, And in the New Jerusalem
   Appoint my soul a place."

   Finally, the reason why the angel's message had such power with Lot was
   that God, Himself, was in it. That gave it a special pressure and I
   have been praying that God, Himself, may be in my message, now--that He
   may speak, gently speak, and powerfully speak to many of you! You will
   scarcely know why it is, but you will say, "I never felt like this
   before. I will arise and go unto my Father. I will repent of my sin. I
   will look to Jesus, the Crucified Savior, God helping me! But why am I
   saying this? Why do I feel thus softened, I who used to be hard as
   steel? Why am I moved to this surrender of myself to my Savior?"

   It will be the sweet Spirit of the blessed God gently working upon your
   heart and graciously inclining you to yield yourself to the Lord! I
   pray that it may be so, even now, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GENESIS 18:17-33; 19:12-28.

   Genesis 18:17-19. And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I
   am doing, seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
   nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? For I
   know him, that he will command his children and his household after
   him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and
   judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He has spoken
   of him. Abraham is called, "the friend of God." It was not merely that
   God was his Friend--that was blessedly true and it was a great wonder
   of Grace--but he was honored to be called, "the friend of God"--one
   with whom God could hold sweet converse, a man after His own heart, in
   whom He trusted, to whom He revealed His secrets. I am afraid there are
   not many men of Abraham's sort in the world just now, but, wherever
   there is such a man with whom God is familiar, he will be sure to be
   one who orders his household aright! If the Lord is my Friend, and if I
   am, indeed, His friend, I shall wish Him to be respected by my
   children, and I shall endeavor to dedicate my children to His service.
   I fear that the decline of family godliness, which is so sadly
   prevalent in these days, is the source of a great many of the crying
   sins of the age! The Church of God at large would have been more
   separate from the world if the little church in each man's house had
   been more carefully trained for God. If you want the Lord to confide in
   you and to trust you with His secrets, you must see that He is able to
   say of you what He said of Abra-ham--"he will command his children and
   his household after him."

   20-22. And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
   great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down, now, and
   see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which
   is come unto Me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned their
   faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before
   the LORD. He was in no hurry to close that blessed interview--when he
   had once come into the Lord's immediate Presence, he lingered there.
   Those who are friends of God like to be much in their Lord's company!

   23. And Abraham drew near. There is nothing like coming very close to
   God in prayer. "Abraham drew near." He was about to use his influence
   with his great Friend--not for himself, but for these men of Sodom who
   were going to be destroyed. Happy are those who, when they are near to
   God, use the opportunity in pleading for others, yes, even for the most
   wicked and abandoned of men.

   23-25. And said, Will You also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
   Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city: will You also
   destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are
   therein? That be far from You to do after this manner, to slay the
   righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the
   wicked, that be far from You. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do
   right? Abraham bases his argument upon the Justice of God! And when a
   man dares to do that, it is mighty pleading, for, depend upon it, God
   will never do an unjust thing! If you dare to plead His Righteousness,
   His Infallible Justice, you plead most powerfully!

   26-30. And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the
   city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. And Abraham
   answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
   Lord, which am but dust and ashes: perhaps there shall lack five of the
   fifty righteous: will You destroy all the city for lack of five? And He
   said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. And he
   spoke unto Him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found
   there. And He said, I will not do it for forty's sake. And he said unto
   Him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Perhaps there
   shall thirty be found there. And He said, I will not do it, if I find
   thirty there. This time the Patriarch has advanced by ten--before, it
   was by fives. Pleading men grow bolder and braver in their requests! A
   man who is very familiar with God will, by-and-by, venture to say that,
   which, at the first, he would not have dared utter!

   31, 32. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
   Lord: Perhaps there shall be twenty found there. And He said, I will
   not destroy it for twenty's sake. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be
   angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Perhaps ten shall be found
   there. And He said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. He went no
   farther than to plead that Sodom might be spared if 10 righteous
   persons could be found in it. I have heard some say that it was a pity
   Abraham did not go on pleading with God, but I would not dare to say
   so. He knew better when to begin and when to leave off than you and I
   do! There are certain restraints in prayer which a man of God cannot
   explain to others, but which he, nevertheless, feels. God moves His
   servants to pray in a certain case and they pray with great liberty and
   manifest power. Another case may seem to be precisely like it, yet the
   mouth of the former suppliant is shut, and in his heart he does not
   feel that he can pray as he did before. Do I blame the men of God?
   Assuredly not! The Lord deals wisely with His servants and He tells
   them, by gentle hints, which they quickly understand, when and where to
   stop in their supplications.

   33. And the LORD went His way, as soon as He had left communing with
   Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. We know that the angels
   went down to Sodom, where they were received by Lot and despitefully
   used by the Sodomites. We will continue our reading at the 12th verse
   of the next chapter.

   Genesis 19:12. And the men said unto Lot, Have you here any besides?
   Son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whatever you have in
   the city, bring them out of this place. Let me bid every Christian to
   look about him, among all his kith and kin, to see which of them yet
   remain unconverted! Let your prayers go up for them all--"Son-in-law,
   and your sons, and your daughters."

   13, 14. For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
   waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD has sent us to
   destroy it. And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, which
   married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the
   LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his
   sons-in-law. "The old man is in his dotage," they said, "he always was
   peculiar. He never acted like the rest of the citizens. He came in here
   as a stranger and he has always been strange in his behavior."

   15, 16. And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
   saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here;
   lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city. And while he
   lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his
   wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful
   unto him; and they brought him forth and set him outside the city. I
   have always felt pleased to think that there were just hands enough to
   lead out these four people, Lot, his wife and their two daughters. Had
   there been one more, there would have been no hand to lay hold of the
   fifth person--but these two angels, with their four hands, could just
   lead these four persons outside the doomed city. God will always have
   agents enough to save His elect--there shall be sufficient Gospel
   preaching, even in the darkest and deadest times--to bring His redeemed
   out of the City of Destruction! God will miss none of His own.

   17. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that
   he said, Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither stay you in
   all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed. Perhaps
   the old man's legs trembled under him. He felt that he could not run so
   far and, besides, the mountain seemed so bleak and dreary he could not
   quite quit the abodes of men.

   18-21. And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lords. Behold now, Your
   servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your
   mercy, which you have shown unto me in saying my life; and I cannot
   escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: behold now,
   this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me
   escape there, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. And he
   said unto him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing, also,
   that I will not overthrow this city, for you have spoken. I think that
   I have said to you before that this sparing of Zoar is an instance of
   the cumulative power of prayer. I may liken Abraham's mighty pleading
   to a ton weight of prayer--supplication that had a wonderful force and
   power! Lot's petition is only like an ounce of prayer. Poor little Lot,
   what a poor little prayer his was! Yet that ounce turned the scale. So,
   it may be that there is some mighty man of God who is near to
   prevailing with God, but he cannot quite obtain his request--but you,
   poor feeble pleader that you are--shall add your feather's weight to
   his great intercession and then the scale will turn! This narrative
   always comforts me! I think that Zoar was preserved, not so much by the
   prayer of Lot, as by the greater prayer of Abraham which had gone
   before, yet the mighty intercession of the friend of God did not
   prevail until it was supported by the feeble petition of poor Lot.

   22. Hasten you, escape there. The hand of Justice was held back until
   God's servant was safe. There can be no destruction of the world, there
   can be no pouring out of the last plagues, there can be no total
   sweeping away of the ungodly until, first of all, the servants of God
   are sealed in their foreheads and taken to a place of security! The
   Lord will preserve His own. He lets the scaffold stand until the
   building is finished--then it will come down fast enough.

   22-28. For I cannot do anything till you are come there. Therefore the
   name of the city was called Zoar. The sun was risen upon the earth when
   Lot entered into Zoar. Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon
   Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of Heaven; and He
   overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of
   the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked
   back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. And Abraham got
   up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
   and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
   plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the
   smoke of a furnace. What must Abraham's meditations have been! What
   should be the meditations of every godly man as he looks towards Sodom
   and sees the smoke of its destruction? It might do some men great good
   if they would not persistently shut their eyes to the doom of the
   wicked. Look, look, I pray you, upon that place of darkness and woe
   where every impenitent and unbelieving spirit must be banished forever
   from the Presence of the Lord! Look till the tears are in your eyes as
   you thank God that you are rescued from so terrible a doom! Look till
   your heart melts with pity for the many who are going the downward road
   and who will eternally ruin themselves unless almighty Grace prevents!

The Child of Light and the Works of Darkness

   (No. 2401)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 24, 1887.

   "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
   reprove them." Ephesians 5:11.

   SINS, especially the grosser vices, are "works of darkness." They
   delight in concealment. They are not fit to be seen. They flourish in
   the darkness of the unrenewed heart. They are most fully maintained in
   the ignorance of a soul that is without the knowledge of the
   ever-blessed God. They are also works of darkness because those who
   follow them have a sad life of it, after all--they are not only dark as
   to knowledge, but they are dark as to comfort as well! There is no true
   light, no real joy in sin. "The wages of sin is death." And they are
   works of darkness, too, because they tend to further darkness--the man
   who pursues them goes from blackness to a deeper blackness--and in the
   end his portion will be darkness unbroken by a ray of hope, "the
   blackness of darkness forever."

   You know that darkness stands for the powers of evil, as light is the
   fit emblem of the holiness of God and of His Infinite goodness and
   purifying Grace. Well, now, whether we, who are the children of light,
   are busy or not, it is quite certain that children of darkness work!
   They are always working--there is no cessation in their activity.
   Master Latimer used to say that the most diligent bishop in England was
   the devil, for whoever did not visit his diocese, the devil was always
   visiting his people! His plow never rusts in the furrow, his sword
   never rests in its scabbard. The powers of darkness cannot be blamed
   for their slothfulness--is there ever a moment in which they are not
   busy and active? Luke warm-ness never steals over the powers of
   darkness! The work of the night goes on horribly, there is no pause to
   it and, therefore, let us who are of the day work, too! God help us to
   counteract the working of the silent, hidden leaven of sin by our own
   struggling to produce in the world a better tone of thought and feeling
   and, by spreading the knowledge of God's Grace and everything which
   will increase reverence to God and love to men!

   The text speaks of the works of darkness and it calls them
   "unfruitful." So they are, for sin is sterile. It produces its like and
   multiplies itself, but as for any fruit that is good, any fruit that
   can elevate and benefit men, any fruit which God can accept and which
   you and I ought to desire, sin is barren as the desert sand! Nothing
   good can come of it. Every now and then we hear it said, "Well, you
   know, on this occasion, we must set aside the higher laws of equity,
   because just now it is imperatively necessary that such and such a
   policy should be pursued." But it is never right, either for an
   individual, or for a nation to do wrong--and the most fruitful policy
   for men and for nations is to do that which will bear the Light of God!
   The works of the Light of God are fruitful works, rich and sweet, and
   fit to be gathered, pleasant to God and profitable to men! But the
   works of darkness are fruitless, they come to nothing, they produce no
   good result. They are like the apples of Sodom which may appear fair to
   the eyes, but he that plucks them shall find that he has nothing but
   ashes in his hand! O you who are performing works of darkness, know
   that no good fruit will come of all your work! You can have nothing
   that is worth having as the result of all your toil!

   My text, which I have just introduced to you by these few remarks,
   demands our attention as a great practical lesson to Christians "Have
   no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove
   them." Those works of darkness which are horrible and unmentionable,
   you cannot have fellowship with them! They produce a very potent evil
   to all mankind and, of course, you will avoid them. Pass not by them
   and flee from them! But you must also keep clear of those works of
   darkness which apparently seem to be colorless and to produce no
   particularly evil effect. You, as a Christian, have to live a solemn,
   earnest, serious life. To you--

   "Life is real, life is earnest,"

   and if there are works of darkness which do not seem to be as bad as
   others, but are simply frivolous, foolish and time-wasting, have no
   fellowship with them! These unfruitful works of darkness are to be
   avoided by you as much as those which are most defiling. Hear this, you
   Christians, and God help you to obey the command!

   In coming to the consideration of our text, let us enquire, first, What
   is forbidden? Fellowship with "the unfruitful works of darkness."
   Secondly, let us ask, What is commanded? "Reprove them." And thirdly,
   let us consider, Why are we to act thus?

   I. First, then, WHAT IS FORBIDDEN? "Have no fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness." We can have fellowship with them in a
   great number of ways.

   Notice that the text does not say, "Have no fellowship with wicked men.
   Have no dealings with men who are not converted," for then we must
   necessarily go out of the world. Many of us are obliged to earn our
   daily bread in the midst of men whom we certainly would not choose for
   our companions. Many of you, I know, are forced every day to hear
   language which is disgusting to you and you are brought into contact
   with modes of procedure which sadden your gracious spirits. Our Savior
   does not pray that you should be taken out of the world, but that you
   should be preserved from the evil of it! If you are what you profess to
   be, you are the salt of the earth, and salt is not meant to be kept in
   a box, but to be well rubbed into the meat to keep it from
   putrefaction. We are not to shut ourselves up as select companies of
   men seeking only our own edification and enjoyment! It is intended that
   we should mingle with the ungodly so far as our duties demand. We are
   forced to do so--it is the Lord's intent that we should, so that we may
   act as salt among them. God grant that the salt may never lose its
   savor and that the unsavory world may never destroy the pungency of the
   piety of God's people! With evil men, then, we must have some kind of
   fellowship--but with their works we are to have no fellowship. In order
   to avoid this evil, let us see what is here forbidden--"Have no
   fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness."

   And first, dear Friends, we have fellowship with the unfruitful works
   of darkness by personally committing the sins so described. "Be not
   deceived; God is not mocked." After all, a man must be judged by his
   life. If you do that which is holy and righteous and gracious, you have
   fellowship with the holy and the righteous and the gracious. But if you
   do that which is unclean and dishonest, you have fellowship with the
   unclean and the dishonest. The Lord will, at the last, put us among
   those whom we are most like--in that day when He shall separate the
   people gathered before Him, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the
   goats--the sheep will be put with the sheep and the goats with the
   goats. If you have lived like the wicked, you will die like the wicked
   and be damned like the wicked! It is only those who live the life of
   the righteous who can hope that they shall die the death of the
   righteous.

   I, who preach to you with all my heart the Doctrines of the Grace of
   God, do, nevertheless, just as boldly remind you that the Grace of God
   brings forth fruit in the life and, where it is really in the heart,
   there will be in the life that which tokens its presence. If you and I
   are drunks, if we can do a dishonest action, if we are guilty of
   falsehood, if we are covetous, (I need not go over the list of all
   those evil things), then we belong to the class of men who delight in
   such practices--and with them we must go forever! We are having
   fellowship with them by doing as they do and we shall have an awful
   fellowship with them at the last by suffering as they shall suffer!

   God make us holy, then! The very name of Jesus signifies that He will
   save His people from their sins and He saves them from their sins by
   their ceasing to commit those sins that others do. His own Word is, "Be
   you holy, for I am holy." "Be you clean that bear the vessels of the
   Lord." Nothing more dishonors Him than to have a following of unclean
   men--men who refuse to be washed and resolve not to quit their old
   sins! Great sinners, yes--the biggest sinners out of Hell--are welcome
   to come to Christ in order to be cleansed from their sin and set free
   from it! He keeps a hospital wherein He receives the most sick of all
   the sick, but it is that He may heal them! And if men do not wish to be
   healed but count the marks of their disease to be beauty-spots--if they
   love their sins and hug them to their bosoms--then thus says the Lord
   to them, "You shall die in your sins." God save all His professing
   people from this form of fellowship with the works of darkness!

   Next, we can have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness by
   teaching wrongdoing, either by plain words or by just inference. Any
   man whose teaching tends towards unholiness, who directly or
   indirectly, either by overt phrase or by natural inference, leads
   another man into sin, is particeps criminis, a partaker of the crime!
   If you teach your children what they ought never to learn. If you teach
   your fellow workmen what they had better never know and if they improve
   upon your lessons, and go much farther than you ever meant that they
   should--if they proceed from folly to crime--you are a partaker of
   their sins and you have fellowship with the unfruitful works of
   darkness. And, believe me, there is nothing more awful than for any
   minister of Christ to have fellowship with the unfruitful works of
   darkness by keeping back any part of the Truth of God--by withholding
   any of the precepts of God's Word, or by denying the terrible and
   eternal consequences of sin! There is nothing more dreadful than the
   end of such a man must be! I think that I would sooner die and be
   judged of God as a murderer of men's bodies, than have to go before the
   Judgment Seat charged with being the murderer of their souls through
   having kept back helpful Truths of God, or insinuated destructive and
   erroneous doctrines! Yes, we can easily have fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness in that way.

   Further, there are some who will have fellowship with the unfruitful
   works of darkness by constraining, commanding, or tempting others to
   sin. How much harm is often done in this respect by lack of thought!
   What you do by another, you do yourself. If you command another to do
   for you what you know to be wrong--I will not say that the other is
   right in the compliance--but I will say that you are wrong in having
   given the command. Let fathers, let masters, let mistresses see to it
   that they never command others to do what God has not commanded them to
   do!

   Sometimes it is not actually a command that you give, but you put the
   person into such a position of temptation and trial that the
   probabilities are that that person will do wrong--and if it is so--in
   the sight of God you will have to share the guilt of that wrong! When a
   master pays his servant less wages than he ought to have--if that
   servant commits a theft, I condemn the theft, but I cannot clear the
   master who put the man into a position in which he must have been
   sorely tempted to take something more to make up for that of which he
   had been defrauded! I do not excuse the theft by him who committed it,
   but, still, I cannot screen the one who put the other where, in all
   probability, he would be driven to commit a dishonest act. If I place a
   man in a position where it is most probable, seeing that human nature
   is what it is, that he will commit a sin. If I have wantonly put him
   there, or put him there for my own profit and gain, I shall be a
   partaker of the sin if he falls!

   If you are a nurse girl and you take those little children and set them
   on the edge of the cliff, letting them go to the very brink of it--and
   they fall over, you cannot clear yourself of blame in the matter! It
   may be that you told the children not to go too close to the edge, but
   then you put them where you might be morally certain that, as children,
   they would go--and you are responsible for all that happens to them.
   So, if I set another in a place where I might be able to stand, myself,
   but might be pretty sure that he could not, I shall be a partaker of
   his sin. "Well, I drink my glass of wine," says one. Yes, and
   apparently it does you no harm, whatever--you have never been excited
   by it, and you feel grateful for it--but there is another man who could
   not do as you have done without becoming a drunk and, by your example
   he is made a drunk and helped to remain so. The practice may be safe
   enough for you, but if it is ruinous to him, take heed lest you be a
   partaker of his unfruitful works of darkness!

   It will require great care and some self-denial, so to act towards
   others that we can say when we go to bed at night, "If any man has done
   a wrong thing, today, it is not because I have set him the example."
   Oh, that we might all repent of other people's sins! Did you ever
   repent of them? "I have had enough to do to repent of my own sins,"
   says one. But these sins of which I am speaking are your own, as well
   as other people's, if you have led others into the way of committing
   the sin, or have put any pressure upon them to lead them to commit the
   sin! You are having fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness!

   Sometimes men get to be partakers of others' sins by provoking them.
   When fathers provoke their children to anger, who has the chief blame
   of that sin? Surely the father has! And when, sometimes, persons
   purposely play upon the infirmities of others to provoke them, are they
   not more to blame than the offenders? I am sure that it is so. I have
   known some try to draw others out when they have known their propensity
   to go beyond the truth--they have, for mirth's sake, led them on and
   tempted them to lie! Who is the greater sinner of the two in such a
   case as that? I am no casuist and shall not attempt to weigh actions,
   but I am able to say this most assuredly, that, if you provoke another
   to anger, that anger is, in part, your sin! If you wantonly incite
   another to sin by daring him to do it, or by any other method of
   tempting him to do wrong, you, yourself, shall share the accusation at
   the Last Great Day.

   Further, Friends, we can be partakers of the unfruitful works of
   darkness by counseling them. There are some men who will not do the
   wrong things, themselves, but they will give evil advice to others and
   so lead them into iniquity. We have known persons act the part of the
   cat with the monkey--they have used some other hand to draw the
   chestnuts from the fire. They were not themselves burned, but, then,
   they really did the deed by their agents. Theirs was the advice, theirs
   the wit, theirs the shrewd hard-headedness by which the evil was done!
   And though they did not appear in the transaction, yet God saw them and
   He will reckon with them in the Day of Account.

   I feel very jealous of myself when I have to give advice--and that
   experience often falls to my lot. A person will plead, "Well, if I do
   right in such a case as this, I shall remain in poverty, or I shall
   lose my job. If I follow out my conscientious convictions to the
   fullest, who is to provide for me?" And, you know, the temptation is to
   feel, "Well, now, really, we must not be too severe in our judgment
   upon this poor soul. Can we not agree with the evident wish of the
   person asking the advice, moderate the Law of God, or, in some way make
   a loophole, and say, Well, it will not be right, but, still, you see,
   under the circumstances_."

   Now, I never dare do that, because, if wrong is done and I have
   counseled it, I shall be a partaker in the wrong! You who are called to
   give advice to others--as many of you may be by reason of your age and
   experience--always give straight advice. Never let any man learn policy
   from you. Of all things in this world, that which often commends itself
   to certain "prudent" men, but which, nevertheless, never ought to
   commend itself to Christians, is the idea of doing a little evil in
   order to obtain a great good! In fact, what we are doing is believing
   ourselves to be wiser than the commands of God and imagining that
   strict truth, honesty and integrity would, after all, not be the best
   thing for men, even though God has so ordained! Let us so guide others
   that we shall have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness!

   But we may have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness by
   consenting to them and tolerating them. For instance, you live in a
   house where there is a great deal of evil going on and you, yourself,
   stay clear of it. So far so good. But you never protest against it--you
   have been altogether silent about it. "Mum," has been the word with you
   and, sometimes, when they come home from a place of evil resort and
   they tell you about the "fun" they have had, you laugh with the rest!
   Or if you do not laugh, at any rate you have not decidedly expressed
   your disapproval. You do disapprove of the evil in secret--you even
   pray against it--but nobody knows that! The wrongdoers, especially, are
   not aware that it is so. In fact, they fancy that, as they treat
   leniently your pursuit of religion, though they think it cant, so you
   treat leniently their pursuit of sin--though in your heart of hearts
   you believe that pursuit to be evil!

   Our Lord commands us to clear ourselves of all toleration of sin--not
   with harshness, not with denunciation and in an unkind spirit--but with
   a mild, gentle, but still powerful, honest rebuke. We must say,
   especially if we are parents, or masters, or persons having much
   influence with others, "Oh, do not this abominable thing! I cannot have
   any share in this evil, even by silently tolerating it. How I wish that
   you would give it up! I entreat you, come out of this Sodom-- escape
   for your lives!" A few more loving home testimonies for God and who can
   tell but that the husband may be converted, and the son may be led to
   the Savior? But for lack of this personal witness among Christians, I
   am afraid that the Church of God comes to be paralyzed and much of her
   power and usefulness is taken from her. Do not let us tolerate or wink
   at sin in any instance, whatever!

   Far be it from us, also, to ever have fellowship with the unfruitful
   works of darkness by commending or applauding sin, or seeming to agree
   with it. We must let all men know that whatever they may do which has
   about it an ill savor, it has an ill savor to us and we cannot endure
   it. We must always protest against it, lest we be partakers of the sins
   of others. O dear Friends, I believe that the great lack of the Church
   just now is holiness! The great need of the Church is nonconformity! I
   mean nonconformity to the world! We must endeavor to bring back the
   strictness of the Puritan times and somewhat more. Everybody is so
   liberal and takes such latitude, nowadays, that in some quarters it is
   impossible to tell which is the Church and which is the world! I have
   even heard some ministers propose that there should be no Church
   distinct from the congregation, but that everybody would be a
   Church-member, without the slightest examination, or even a profession
   of conversion!

   It is supposed that people are now so generally good that we may take
   them indiscriminately and that they will make a Church quite good
   enough for the Lord Jesus Christ! Ah, me, that is not according to
   Christ's mind, and that is not Christ's teaching! God's call to this
   age, as to all that went before, is, "Come out from among them and be
   you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I
   will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and you shall be My
   sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty." Bear your protest, my
   Brothers and Sisters, against everything that is unrighteous and
   unholy--everything that is not God-like and Christ-like--and let your
   lives be such that men shall not need to ask to whom you belong,
   whether to God or to the devil, but they shall see at once that you are
   the people of the ever-living and blessed God!

   This, then, is what is forbidden--"Have no fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness."

   II. The time flies so fast that I can only very briefly answer the
   second question, WHAT IS COMMANDED? "Reprove them." Our life's business
   in the world comprehends this among our other Christian duties--the
   reproving of the unfruitful works of darkness.

   First, we are to rebuke sin. I find that the word which is here
   rendered, "reprove," is that which is used concerning the Holy
   Spirit--"When He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, of
   righteousness, and of judgment." We are, therefore, so to live as to
   let the Light of God in upon men's consciences that we may rebuke them
   for their sin!

   But we are also to try to let the sinners, themselves, see the
   sinfulness of their sin, to let the Light in upon the sin and, by God's
   Grace, so to reprove them as to convict them of sin--to make them feel,
   from the testimony of God's people, that sin is an evil and a bitter
   thing--and that their course of conduct is that evil thing. The Light
   of God has come into the world on purpose that the darkness may know
   that it is darkness and that God's Light may overcome and disperse it.
   We are not to quench our Light and mingle with others who are in the
   dark, but to unveil our lamps and let the Light that is in them so
   shine that the darkness shall thereby be reproved! I do not say,
   Brothers and Sisters, that we are to go through the world wearing surly
   faces, looking grim as death, perpetually promulgating the Law of God
   and saying, "You shall not do this and you shall not do that." But,
   cheerful as we must be with the Love of God in our hearts, we shall
   prove to men that the freest and the happiest life is a life of
   holiness, a life of consecration to God and that, together with the
   faithful testimony of our lips, shall be a reproving of the sin that is
   in the world. The very existence of a true Believer is the reproof of
   unbelief! The existence of an honest man is the reproof of knavery! The
   existence of a godly man is the best reproof of ungodliness! But when
   that existence is backed up by verbal testimony and by a consistent
   example, then the command in the text is fulfilled, for we are
   reproving the unfruitful works of darkness.

   III. Thirdly, let us ask, WHY ARE WE TO ACT THUS? Why are we sent into
   the world, dear Friends, to reprove sin and not to follow in its track?
   The reasons are given in this very chapter.

   First, because we are God's dear children and, therefore, we must be
   imitators of Him. You, a child of God, and having fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness? You, a child of God, imitating the lost
   and fallen world? You, a child of God, submitting to the influences of
   the devil and his filthy crew? Far be it from you! Ask your Father to
   make you holy as He is holy. To that end were you born and sent into
   the world--entreat your Father to help you to fulfill the very purpose
   of your being!

   Next, remember that we who are Believers have an inheritance in the
   Kingdom of God. We are heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ.
   Well, then, shall we have fellowship with those who have no inheritance
   in this Kingdom? Remember what we read just now--"For this you know,
   that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an
   idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God." And
   will you, who have a part in this inheritance, make common lot with
   such people? Oh, be it far from you! Heir of Glory, will you be a
   companion of the heirs of wrath? Joint-heir with Christ, will you sit
   on the drunk's bench, or sing an unclean song with the profane? Are
   their places of amusement fit for you to frequent? Are their dens of
   iniquity haunts for you? Up and away from the dwellings of these wicked
   men and women lest you are destroyed in their destruction!

   A little further down in the chapter, in the seventh and eighth verses,
   we read--"Be not you, therefore, partakers with them. For you were
   sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord." What? Has a
   marvelous conversion happened to you? Have you been turned from
   darkness to light? Are you really new creatures in Christ Jesus, or is
   it all a lie? For if, indeed, you have been twice-born, if you have had
   a resurrection from among the dead, if a second creation has been
   worked in you, how can you go and live with these dead men and mingle
   with these who know not the life of God? Unless your profession is
   nothing but a farce or a fraud, Grace will so constrain you that you
   must come out and refuse to have fellowship with the unfruitful works
   of darkness!

   The text describes these works as being unfruitful and you read, in the
   ninth verse, "The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
   righteousness and truth." Now, if you are to bear the fruits of the
   Spirit, what fellowship can you have with the unfruitful works of
   darkness? The two things are opposed to one another! You fruit-bearing
   trees, are you going to join in affinity with these cumber-grounds that
   soon must be cut down and cast into the fire? What? Will you interlace
   your vine branches with these fig trees that have leaves upon them, but
   no fruit, and upon which no fruit will ever grow, for they are under
   the curse of God? No, it must not be so! People of God, serve Him and
   come away from those who render Him no service, but who rather seek to
   pull down His holy Temple, and to destroy His name and influence from
   among the sons of men!

   The Apostle gives us one more reason why we should have no fellowship
   with the unfruitful works of darkness--"for it is a shame, even, to
   speak of those things which are done by them in secret." What? Shall we
   have fellowship with things of which we are ashamed, even, to speak?
   Yet I have to say it and to say it to my own sorrow and horror--I have
   known professors to have fellowship with things that I dare not even
   think of now! They have been found out at last--some of them were never
   found out till after they were dead. What a life to lead--to sit with
   God's people at the Communion Table! To talk, even, to others about the
   way of salvation, yet all the while living in the practice of secret
   sin! Why, surely, it were better to get into prison at once than to be
   always afraid of being caught! To go up and down the world making a
   profession of religion and yet to be acting a lie all the while, and
   living in constant fear of being found out! Whatever sin we may fall
   into, God save us from hypocrisy and make us honest and straightforward
   in all things! Shall we, then, go and have fellowship with things of
   which we should be ashamed, even, to speak? God forbid!

   I am afraid that I am speaking many Truths of God that you will regard
   as having nothing in them that is comfortable to you, but, Brothers and
   Sisters, can I help it? Can it be avoided? If we are to make full proof
   of our ministry and preach all the Truth to you, must we not take every
   passage of God's Word, whether it is of rebuke or of comfort, in its
   due season? To myself, the effect of thinking over this subject is
   this--I have cried, "Lord, have mercy upon me." I have fled, again, to
   the Cross of Christ. I have sought anew for an anointing of the Holy
   Spirit that I might not, in anything, have fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness. And if my discourse has that effect upon
   you, it will do you great service! Oh, ask the Lord to make our outward
   lives more thoroughly pure and true! Give me a little Church of really
   gracious, devoted, upright, godly men, and I will be glad to minister
   to them and I shall expect God to bless them!

   But give me a large Church consisting of thousands, if there are in it
   many whose lives, if they were known, would disgust a man of God, and
   whose lives, being known to the Spirit of God, are a grief to Him, why,
   then the blessing must be withheld! We may preach our hearts out and
   wear ourselves to death in all kinds of holy service, but, with an
   Achan in the camp, Israel cannot win the victory! I beseech you,
   therefore, search and look! One pair of eyes, two pairs of eyes in the
   pastorate, and the eyes of the elders and deacons of the Church can
   never suffice to watch over such a company as this is! The Lord watch
   over you, and may you have a mutual oversight of one another! And,
   above all, may each one exercise daily watchfulness over his own heart
   and life! Thus, beloved Brothers and Sisters Christ, I leave the text
   with you, praying God to bless it--"Have no fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."

   Now, if any here are living in fellowship with those unfruitful works
   of darkness, I pray them to escape for their lives from them! May they
   fly to Christ, who alone can save them! And when they have once found
   healing through His wounds and life through His death, then let them
   pray to be kept from all sin that they may lead a holy and gracious
   life to the glory of Him who has washed them in His own most precious
   blood! The Lord send a blessing, for His dear Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EPHESIANS5.

   Verse 1. Be you, therefore, followers of God. Or, imitators of God--

   1. As dear children. Children are naturally imitators. They are usually
   inclined to imitate their father. This is, therefore, a most comely and
   appropriate precept--

   "Be you, therefore, imitators of God, as dear children."

   2. And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given Himself
   for us, an offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor.
   What a path to walk in! "Walk in love." What a well-paved way it is!
   "As Christ also has loved us." What a blessed Person for us to follow
   in that divinely royal road! It would have been hard for us to tread
   this way of love if it had not been that His blessed feet marked out
   the trail for us. We are to love as Christ has loved us and the
   question which will often solve difficulties is this, "What would Jesus
   Christ do in my case? What He would have done, that we may do--"Walk in
   love, as Christ also has loved us." And if we want to know how far that
   love may be carried, we need not be afraid of going too far in
   self-denial. We may even make a sacrifice of ourselves for love of God
   and men, for here is our model--"As Christ also has loved us, and has
   given Himself for us, an offering and a Sacrifice to God for a
   sweet-smelling savor."

   3. But fornication and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be
   once named among you, as becomes saints. So far from ever falling under
   the power of these evils, do not even name them--count them sins
   unmentionable to holy ears! In what a position do we find,
   "covetousness," placed--side by side with, "fornication and all
   uncleanness"! In the Epistle to the Colossians, covetousness is called,
   "idolatry," as if the Holy Spirit thought so ill of this sin that He
   could never put it in worse company than it deserved to be in! Yet I
   fear it is a very common sin even among some who call themselves
   saints. God deliver us altogether from its sway and help us to hate the
   very name of it!

   4. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
   convenient, but rather, giving of thanks. All sorts of evil, frivolous,
   fruitless talk should be condemned by the Christian. He should feel
   that he lives at a nobler rate, he lives to purpose--he lives to bear
   fruit--and that which has no fruit about it and out of which no good
   can come is not for him. "But rather, giving of thanks." Oh, for more
   of this giving of thanks! It should perfume the labors of the day! It
   should sweeten the rest of the night, this giving of thanks! We are
   always receiving blessings--let us never cease to give God thanks for
   them. If we never leave off thanking until we are beyond the need of
   blessing, we shall go on praising the Lord as long as we live, here,
   and continue to do so throughout eternity!

   5. For this you know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
   covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of
   Christ and of God. What a sweeping sentence! This is, indeed, a sword
   with two edges! Many will flinch before it and yet, though they flinch,
   they will not escape, for Paul speaks neither more nor less than the
   Truth when he declares that "no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
   covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of
   Christ and of God."

   6. Let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things
   comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. These are the
   very things God hates! If, therefore, they are in you, God cannot look
   upon you with the love that He feels towards His children. "These
   things" He cannot endure and, "because of these things comes the wrath
   of God upon the children of disobedience."

   7. 8. Be not you, therefore, partakers with them. For you were
   sometimes darkness. Then, "these things" suited you.

   8. But now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light. Get
   clean away from these dark things! Travel no more in the thick gloom of
   these abominations! God help you to walk in the Light as He is in the
   Light!

   9. 10. (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
   righteousness and truth) proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. We
   ought to pray that our whole life may be "acceptable unto the Lord." We
   are, ourselves, "accepted in the Beloved." And, that being the case, it
   should be our great desire that every thought and word and deed, yes,
   every breath of our life should be "acceptable unto the Lord."

   11, 12. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
   but rather reprove them. For it is a shame, even, to speak of those
   things which are done by them in secret. It was so with the old heathen
   world in which Paul lived--he could not write or speak of those
   abominable vices which defiled the age. But is London any better than
   Ephesus? Surely, old Corinth, which became a sink of sin, was not a
   worse Sodom than this great modern Babylon! There is great cause to say
   of the wicked, even to this day, "It is a shame, even, to speak of
   those things which are done by them in secret."

   13. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.
   Then drag them to the Light of God! There will be a great howling when
   these dogs of darkness have the Light let in upon them, but it has to
   be done.

   13-15. For whatever makes manifest is light. Therefore He says, Awake,
   you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you
   light. See, then, that you walk circumspectly. Not carelessly, not
   thinking that it is of no importance how you live, but looking all
   around you, "walk circumspectly," watching lest, even in seeking one
   good thing, you spoil another. Never present to God one duty stained
   with the blood of another duty! "See then that you walk circumspectly."

   15, 16. Not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time. Buying up the
   hours--they are of such value that you cannot pay too high a price for
   them!

   16-18. Because the days are evil. Therefore be you not unwise, but
   understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine,
   wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit. If you want
   excitement, seek this highest, holiest, happiest form of
   exhilaration--the Divine exhilaration which only the Holy Spirit can
   give you--"Be filled with the Spirit."

   19. Speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. We would have
   thought that Paul would have said, "singing and making melody with your
   voices to the Lord," but the Apostle, guided by the Holy Spirit,
   overlooks the sound, which is the mere body of the praise, and looks to
   the heart, which is the living soul of the praise--"Making melody in
   your heart to the Lord," for the Lord cares not merely for sounds,
   though they are the sweetest that ever came from the lips of man or
   angel--He looks at the heart. God is a Spirit and He looks spiritually
   at our spiritual praises--therefore let us make melody in our heart to
   the Lord.

   20, 21. Giving thanks, always, for all things unto God and the Father
   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; submitting yourselves, one to
   another, in the fear of God. That principle of maintaining your rights,
   standing up for your dignity and so on, is not according to the mind of
   the Spirit! It is His will that you should, rather, yield your rights
   and, for the sake of peace, and the profit of your Brothers and
   Sisters, give up what you might naturally claim as properly belonging
   to you--"Submitting yourselves, one to another, in the fear of God."

   22-30. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
   Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ's is the
   Head of the Church and He is the Savior of the body. Therefore as the
   Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own
   husbands, in everything. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also
   loved the Church, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify and
   cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word, that He might present
   it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
   such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought
   men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife
   loves himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes
   and cherishes it, even as the Lord, the Church; for we are members of
   His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. What a wonderful expression!
   To think that we, poor creatures that we are, should be thus joined to
   Christ by a marriage union, no, by a vital union--is, indeed, amazing!
   Oh, the depths of the love of Christ, that such an expression as this
   should be possible!

   31, 32. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
   shall be joined unto his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. This is
   a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church. There is
   the mystery, that He should leave His Father, and quit the home above,
   and become one flesh with His elect, going with them and for their
   sakes, through poverty, pain, shame and death! This is a marvel and a
   mystery, indeed!

   33. Nevertheless, let everyone of you in particular so love his wife
   even as himself, and the wife see that she reverence her husband. Thus
   the Spirit of God follows us to our homes and teaches us how to live to
   the Glory of God! May He help us to do so, for Christ's sake! Amen.

Under Arrest

   (No. 2402)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 3, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING MARCH 3,
   1887.

   "Butbefore faith came, we were kept under the Law, shut up unto the
   faith which should afterwards be revealed." Galatians 3:23.

   THIS is a condensed history of the Jews before the Gospel was fully
   preached to them. Before the clear and plain revelation of the way of
   salvation--that is to say, before Jesus Christ, Himself, actually
   appeared among the sons of men--the Hebrew nation was put under the
   tutorship and governance of the Mosaic Law. So far as salvation was to
   be obtained by it, that Law was a total failure. It did not make the
   Jews a holy people--whenever they reached any point of excellence, they
   soon went back from it, for they were bent on backsliding. Whatever the
   influence of that blessed Law might be supposed to be, the actual net
   result was very poor, indeed, for, when Christ came to the chosen
   people, they were in a most miserable condition, and there was no hope
   for them at all apart from the promised Messiah. They were shut up to
   the alternative of receiving Him, or else being put away as a nation
   for a long time of banishment and exile. This, indeed, they have
   actually endured through their rejection of the one and only Savior.

   I am not going to preach at this time about the Jews, but I want to
   show you that the history of every soul chosen of God is very like the
   history of the chosen nation. I have heard of masses of crystal which
   assume certain forms and, if they are split up, again and again,
   however small the particles may be, the same crystalline shape
   remains--the crystals are still of one form! So, if you take a nation
   as a mass, its spiritual history will be found in each individual and
   often every experience of that individual will still bear the same
   shape and outline. I take this text, therefore, as being, I am sure, a
   picture of myself. Before faith came, I was, "kept under the Law, shut
   up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed." And my
   impression is that this is the history of all the people of God, more
   or less. We are not all alike in every respect. We differ greatly in
   certain particulars, yet the main features of all the children of God
   will be found to be the same--and their Christian experience will
   resemble that of the other members of the Lord's family.

   So I shall leave the text as a matter of history of the Jews and use it
   as the life-story of many here present! Perhaps while I am explaining
   the experience of the child of God, there may be some, here, who are
   passing through the darker stages of that experience, who may gather
   hope from that fact and say, "I see that my spot is the spot of the
   Lord's children. Possibly, my soul-trouble, being like theirs, may be
   producing in me the same result as it produced in them." And thus, I
   trust, while I am speaking, some may be led into a clearer light and
   may even come into the full light of God's reconciled Countenance!

   There are three things that I am going to talk about as the Holy Spirit
   shall guide me. The first is, the unhappy period--it was long ago with
   some of us--the unhappy period "before faith came." Secondly, I shall
   describe the custody we were in at that time--"we were kept under the
   Law, shut up." That is where we were when the spirit of bondage was
   holding us in captivity "before faith came." Then, thirdly, I shall
   have a little to say upon the revelation which set us free--"the faith
   which should afterwards be revealed."

   I. First, then, I have to say something about THE UNHAPPY PERIOD.
   "Before faith came." As I said just now, this period was long ago with
   some of us, but it was not so far back with others of you, "before
   faith came."

   We remember, some of us, when we had no idea of faith. We were, in a
   measure, religiously inclined, and in a certain way, sincere and
   devout. As a matter of duty, we went to Church, or we went to the
   Meeting House, and we felt easy in our mind because we had been there.
   As a matter of duty, we read our Bibles and, sometimes, we felt a
   pleasure in getting through the chapter--perhaps we had all the more
   pleasure if the chapter was not a long one! We did not object to family
   prayer--it may be that we had been used to it from our childhood. The
   less we had of it, the better we liked, it but still, we kept to it,
   although it was always only a matter of duty.

   As to saving faith, we had not an intelligent idea of it. Our notion
   was that good people would get to Heaven and that we must do our best
   to make ourselves fit to be in that holy place. We had a great many
   shortcomings and failures, no doubt, but in some mysterious way we
   fancied that all would get rectified and we would be all right if we
   were only sincere. Many still seem to imagine that it does not matter
   what persons believe as long as they are sincere, nor what they do so
   long as they are conscientious in doing it. That was our notion, but as
   to any idea of there being a faith peculiar to God's elect, a faith
   which saves the soul by linking us to the Savior--if anyone had talked
   to us in that fashion--we would have said, "Yes, that is, no doubt,
   orthodox teaching--we have heard that Martin Luther taught that
   doctrine at the time of the Reformation, but what he meant by it, we
   have not the slightest idea!" We did not know. We had not formed any
   idea of that which, had we known it, would have been the chief joy of
   our minds and hearts--in that unhappy period we had no idea of faith.

   Some of us used to hear the Gospel. Some of us did not. But, whether we
   heard the Gospel or not, "before faith came," we did not know what it
   was. I have no doubt that I heard, hundreds of times, such texts as
   these--"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." "Look unto Me
   and be you saved, all the ends of the earth." "As Moses lifted up the
   serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up:
   that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." But I still had no intelligent idea of what faith meant. When I
   first discovered what faith really was, and exercised it, for with me
   these two things came together, I believed as soon as I knew what
   believing meant. And then I thought I had never heard that Truth of God
   preached before! But, on looking back, I am persuaded that the Light of
   God often shone in my eyes, but I was blind and, therefore, I thought
   that the Light had never come. The Light was shining all the while, but
   there was no power to receive it--the eyeballs of the soul were not
   sensitive to the Divine beams!

   Perhaps some of you did not hear the Gospel, for it is by no means a
   difficult thing to attend a place of worship year after year, and yet
   not hear the Gospel. I am sorry that it should be so, but I know that
   it is so--there is a great deal of preaching that may be edifying to
   Christians, a great deal that is morally excellent--but the way of
   salvation by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ is often regarded by
   the preacher as a Truth of God too elementary to be introduced to the
   notice of a congregation so intelligent and so experienced as the one
   he is privileged to address! This is a great mistake for any minister
   to make. The Lord's command to Moses was, "With all your offerings you
   shall offer salt," and His injunction to all His servants, now, is,
   "With all your teaching, preach the simple doctrine of faith in Christ
   Crucified." I delight to cry, with the Apostle Paul, "God forbid that I
   should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ," and it is my
   constant joy to preach that simple doctrine of, "Believe, and live."
   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." But whether
   people heard the Gospel or did not hear it, I know that it has often
   been the case that "before faith came" no idea of what faith is had
   penetrated the soul! Much was heard about it, but nothing was
   understood. Much, in some respects, was understood about the doctrine,
   but faith, itself, was still unknown.

   And, beloved Brothers and Sisters, as it is that before faith comes we
   have no idea of it, and we do not understand it, so we have been
   puzzled to think of what it could be when we have seen it in others. We
   have heard of others, we have read of others and the most of us have
   seen others who have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal
   life. And we have wished that we could do the same. We have looked upon
   their experience as some extraordinary secret, some marvelous mystery,
   some special manifestation--and we have said to ourselves, "We can
   never reach that height on which those people stand." So we have
   continued our Chapel going, our Bible reading and so forth, under the
   notion that faith was something quite impossible for us.

   We have thought of it as if it were some precious diamond that kings
   and queens might buy, but it was not for poor people like us. Though we
   have been told over and over again, that--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One," we have said, "Yes,
   life for a look, ah, yes! No doubt that is true, but I cannot look."
   And so we have still turned away from the one hope of salvation!
   Perhaps we have been still further pressed by some earnest spirit and
   the Truth has been made as plain as a pikestaff, yet we still could not
   think that the speaker really meant what he said--there must be some
   strange mystery at the back of it all. We asked ourselves--"How do
   people obtain faith? Of course, it is simple enough to those who
   understand it, but as for us poor souls who do not comprehend it, how
   can we get to know what it means and how can we obtain it for
   ourselves?" That was the puzzled condition in which we were "before
   faith came." We were just in that kind of state, so that, even when we
   wished to believe, it seemed to us as if it was something altogether
   beyond our reach.

   There was also a time with us, dear Friends, when "before faith came"
   in its healing and comforting power, a measure of faith came to wound,
   cut and kill. We saw our sin, we felt our need of a Savior and we
   believed so far as this--that Christ was a Savior, that He was the
   Savior, and that He could save us. But our difficulty was like that of
   the woman in the crowd who tried to touch the hem of Christ's
   garment--how could we get in contact with Him? What could we do to be
   saved? Oh, the many times that I have wished the preacher would tell me
   something to do that I might be saved! Gladly would I have done it, if
   it had been possible. If he had said, "Take off your shoes and
   stockings, and run to John O'Groat's," I would not even have gone home,
   first, but would have started off that very night, that I might win
   salvation! How often have I thought that if they had said, "Bare your
   back to the scourge and take 50 lashes!" I would have said, "Here I am!
   Come along with your whip and beat as hard as you please, so long as I
   can but obtain peace and rest, and get rid of my sin."

   Yet that simplest of all matters--believing in Christ Crucified,
   accepting His finished salvation, being nothing and letting Him be
   everything, doing nothing but trusting to what He has done--I could not
   get a hold of it at all! I might truthfully say that I have known many
   who, after years of what I think was very sincere and earnest hearing,
   still remain just the same, apparently willing, but really unwilling to
   believe! They wish to know the way of salvation--and the road is open
   right straight before them--yet they no not experimentally know the way
   of life, the only way by which a man can be eternally saved! I am
   speaking, at this time, I do not doubt, to many who are still in that
   fog, still bewildered, and knowing not which way to turn, albeit that
   from this platform there sounds forth that clarion note and nothing
   else, "Look to Jesus and live! Believe in Him. Trust in Him and you
   shall be saved at once, yes, saved eternally, from the moment that you
   have done with self and, by faith, have laid hold on Christ!"

   Why is it that people do not believe? I suppose it is, partly, because
   they are so proud. You, my Friend, have a proud notion in your head
   that there is, after all, something due from God to you! In truth,
   there is nothing due from God to you but that He should let you perish
   in your sin--that is all He owes you! You have so sinned against Him
   that if He should, at this moment, cast you into the lowest Hell, it is
   all that you have any right to expect! And He will have you know this
   and make you feel it before He will speak a word of blessing to your
   soul. You are too high and mighty to be saved as you are--you must come
   down from that lofty position. This, then, is one reason why men do not
   "believe and live," because they are too proud to be saved by simple
   faith in the Lord Jesus Christ!

   Besides, salvation by believing seems so strange, so amazing, so
   contrary to the usual run of human opinion and, in addition, it is so
   spiritual that the natural man rebels against it. If it were but a
   carnal thing, something to be done with the hands, or performed with
   the feet, we could do that--but the spiritual action of believing, the
   action which honors God by taking salvation as the free gift of His
   Grace and mercy--we cannot bend our backs and stoop so low as that! The
   fact is that it is difficult because it is easy! It is difficult
   because there is no difficulty in it and it seems obscure simply
   because it is so clear! There is nothing for you to do, O lost Sinner,
   but to yield yourself up to your God and accept His Sovereign Mercy
   which He freely gives you in the Person of His dear Son! Still, though
   I have said all this so plainly, you do not believe me--you do not yet
   understand what I mean, unless you have been taught of the Spirit!
   That, then, is how we were in the unhappy period "before faith came."

   II. Now I want to show you, in a few words, THE CUSTODY WE WERE IN.
   "Before faith came, we were kept under the Law, shut up." The word for,
   "kept," means that we were arrested and given in charge, or that we
   were taken under the care of a garrison. The Ten Commandments of God,
   like ten armed legionaries, took us into custody and held us fast.
   "Before faith came, we were kept under the Law." How was that?

   When the Spirit of God began to deal with us, we found that we were
   always within the sphere of Law--we could not get out of it. We woke in
   the morning--there was the Law right in front of us. All during the
   day--there was the Law right before our eyes. If we went to sleep at
   night--there was the Law--we were everywhere under the Law. We said,
   with David, "Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Or where shall I flee
   from Your Presence?" When once we recognized

   God and realized the fact that we were His creatures, there came into
   our startled conscience the remembrance of the universality of Law!

   I remember that experience and how I thought of what was said of the
   old Roman empire that, under the rule of Caesar, if a man once broke
   the law of Rome, he was in prison everywhere! The whole world was one
   vast prison to him, for he could not get out of the reach of the
   imperial power--and so did it come to be in my awakened conscience!
   Wherever I went, the Law of God had a demand upon my thoughts, upon my
   words, upon my rising, upon my resting. What I did and what I did not
   do, all came under the cognizance of the Law--and then I found that
   this Law so surrounded me that I was always running against it! I was
   always breaking it! I seemed as if I were a sinner and nothing else but
   a sinner. If I opened my mouth, I spoke amiss. If I sat still, there
   was sin in my silence. I remember that when the Spirit of God was thus
   dealing with me, I used to feel myself to be a sinner, even, when I was
   in the House of God! I thought that when I sang, I was mocking the Lord
   with a solemn sound upon a false tongue! And if I prayed, I feared that
   I was sinning in my prayers, insulting Him by uttering confessions
   which I did not feel and asking for mercies with a faith that was not
   at all true, but only another form of unbelief! Oh, yes, some of us
   know what it is to be given into custody to the Law! Perhaps some here
   are now in this condition without quite understanding it.

   At that time, when I was in the custody of the Law, I did not take any
   pleasure in sin! Alas, I sinned, but my sense of the Law of God kept me
   back from a great many sins. I could not, as others did, plunge into
   profligacy, or indulge in any of the grosser vices, for that Law had me
   well in hand! I sinned enough without acting like that. Oh, I used to
   tremble to put one foot before another, for fear I would do wrong! I
   felt that my old sins seemed to be so many that it were well to die
   rather than commit any more! The Law of God, when it gets a man into
   its charge, makes him feel just like that.

   Then, I could not find any rest while under the custody of the Law. If
   I wanted to sleep a while, or to be a little indifferent and careless,
   then some one or other of those Ten Commandments roughly awakened me
   and, looking on me with a frowning face, said, "You have broken me!" I
   thought that I would do some good works but, somehow, the Law always
   broke my good works in the making. I fancied that if my tears flowed
   freely, I might make some recompense for my wrongdoing, but the Law
   held up the mirror and I soon saw my face all smeared and made more
   unhandsome by my tears. The Law of God shut me up in all directions and
   would not let me rest anywhere when I was under its custody.

   Then, also, the Law seemed to blight all my hopes. I hoped this and I
   hoped that--but then the Law said, "Cursed is everyone that continues
   not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them."
   And I knew I had not continued in all those things, so I saw myself
   accursed, turn which way I might! I had offended against the justice of
   God! I was impure and polluted! And I used to say, "If God does not
   send me to Hell, He ought to." I sat in judgment upon myself and
   pronounced the sentence that I felt would be just. I could not have
   gone to Heaven with my sin unpardoned, even if I had had the offer to
   do it, for I knew that it would not be right that I should do so--I
   justified God in my own conscience while I condemned myself!

   One thing I found concerning the Law, that it would not even let me
   despair. If I thought I would give up all desire to do right and just
   go and drown my conscience in sin, the Law said, "No, you cannot do
   that, there is no rest for you in sinning. You know the Law too well to
   be able to sin in the blindness of a seared conscience." So the Law
   worried and troubled me at all points--it shut me up as in an iron
   cage--every way of escape was effectually blocked up!

   I am talking now, not only of my own experience, but also of the
   experience of many another child of God. I will tell you one or two of
   the things that shut me up dreadfully. One was when I knew the
   spirituality of the Law. If the Law said, "You shall not commit
   adultery," I said to myself, "Well, I have never committed adultery."
   Then the Law, as interpreted by Christ, said, "Whoever looks on a woman
   to lust after her has committed adultery with her, already, in his
   heart." The Law said, "You shall not steal," and I said, "Well, I never
   stole anything." but then I found that even the desire to possess what
   was not my own was guilt! The spirituality of the Law astounded me!
   What hope could I have of escaping from such a Law as this which in
   every way surrounded me with an atmosphere from which I could not
   possibly escape?

   Then, as I have already reminded you, the Law informed me that I was
   cursed unless I continued in all things that were written in the Book
   of the Law, so that, if I had not committed one sin, that made no
   difference if I had committed another sin, for I was under the curse.
   What if I had never blasphemed God with my tongue? Yet, if I had
   coveted, I had broken the Law. He who breaks a chain might say, "I did
   not break that link, or the other link." No, but if you break one link,
   you have broken the chain! Ah, me, how I then seemed shut up!

   Then I remembered that, even if I kept the Law perfectly, and kept it
   for ten, twenty, or thirty years without a fault, yet if, at the end of
   that time, I should then break it, I must suffer its dread penalty!
   Those words spoken by the Lord to the Prophet Ezekiel came to my
   mind--"If he trusts to his own righteousness and commits iniquity, all
   his righteousness shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he
   has committed, he shall die for it." So I saw that I was, as the text
   says, "shut up." I had hoped to escape this way, or that way, or some
   other way. Was I not "christened" when I was a child? Had I not been
   taken to a place of worship? Had I not been brought up to regularly say
   my prayers? Had I not been an honest, upright, moral youth? Was all
   this nothing? "Nothing," said the Law, as it drew its sword of fire!
   "Cursed is everyone that continues not in all things which are written
   in the Book of the Law to do them." So there was no rest for my spirit,
   no, not even for a moment.

   What was I to do? I was in the custody of one that showed no mercy
   whatever, for Moses never said, "Mercy." The Law has nothing to do with
   mercy! That comes from another mouth and under another dispensation.
   But before I turn to that other point, I would like to say that if any
   of you are passing through all that I have been describing, do not be
   at all discouraged! I rejoice that it is so with you, for this breaking
   down of the idols is the way to set up the true God in your heart! This
   cleaning out of your refuges of lies is a blessed work of God who loves
   you, though He seems, now, to be dealing out to you the blows of a
   cruel one! This is the way in which He is severing you from your
   deceptions, freeing you from your delusions so that He may bring you to
   His Truth and to Himself! That is my last point.

   III. THE REVELATION WHICH SET US FREE--"We were shut up unto the faith
   which should afterwards be revealed."

   Now let me tell the story. It was on a day, never to be forgotten, when
   I first understood that salvation was in and through Another--that my
   salvation could not be of myself--but must be through One better and
   stronger than I. And I heard--and oh, what music it was that the Son of
   God had taken upon Himself our human nature and had, by His life and
   death, worked out a perfect salvation, finished from top to bottom,
   which He was ready to give to every soul that was willing to have
   it--and that salvation was all of Grace from first to last, the free
   gift of God through His blessed Son, Jesus Christ! Oh, the melody of
   that doctrine! "But I have heard that lots of times," says one. Have
   you ever heard it at all? "Why, I heard you say it just now!" Again I
   put the question--Have you heard it? It has passed your ears, but have
   you ever heard it? Have you ever caught the meaning of it?

   Then I had this vision--not a vision to my eyes, but to my heart. I saw
   what a Savior Christ was--Divine as well as Human! I saw what
   sufferings His were, what a righteousness His was. I saw the fullness
   of Christ, the Glory of Christ, the Love of Christ, the Power of Christ
   to save to the uttermost, them that come unto God by Him!

   Now I can never tell you how it was, but I no sooner saw whom I was to
   believe than I also understood what it was to believe and I believed in
   one moment! As much as if it had never been revealed to any mortal man,
   or written in this blessed Book, it was revealed to me by the Spirit of
   God that I, guilty wretch as I was, was then and there to fall at those
   dear feet that once were nailed to the Cross, and to take Jesus Christ
   to be my Lord and Savior--and that the moment I did so, I would be
   saved!

   I did take Him as my Savior and I am saved! And I come to tell you,
   again tonight, the reason why I took Him for my Savior. To my own
   humiliation, I must confess that I did it because I could not help
   it--I was shut up to it. That Law-work, of which I told you, had
   hammered me into such a condition that if there had been 50 other
   saviors, I could not have thought of them! I was driven to this One--I
   needed a Divine Savior--I needed One who was made a curse for me to
   expiate my guilt! I needed One who had died, for I deserved to die. I
   needed One who had risen again, who was able, by His life, to make me
   live! I needed the exact Savior that stood before me in the Word of
   God, revealed to my heart--and I could not help having Him!

   And, what is more, I cannot help still having Him as my Savior--I am
   shut up to it! I think I have told you of an American Brother who sat
   in one of the pews behind me, one Sunday night. When I went out, I said
   to him, "What? You, here again?" He said, "Yes, it is 20 years since I
   sat in this pew. I wondered if you would remember me." I said, "Oh,
   yes, I do remember your face right well!" He said, "You are still
   hitched in the old place, I see." "Yes," I replied, "and if God spares
   you to come in another 20 years' time, and I have not gone to Heaven,
   meanwhile, you will find that I am hitched in the same old place, then,
   too!"

   I have nothing to tell of but Christ Crucified! Nothing to say to the
   sinner but, "Away, away, away from all other confidences, to Him whom
   God has set forth to be a propitiation for sin!" I want the Law to shut
   you right up to this one course. If a man were to ask, "Why do you go
   out of the Tabernacle by the right hand door?" it would be a very good
   answer if you had to say, "Because all the rest are bricked up." That
   would be a valid reason, would it not? You had no choice in the
   matter--and that is the reason why we come to Christ--because we have
   tried, and proved, and known that there is none other salvation, for,
   "there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must
   be saved." The Law has shut us up to this one road! It has stopped up
   every other opening and gangway--and we are driven to stand here, and
   say--

   "You, O Christ, are all I need More than all, in You I find."

   Now, if there are any of you who have gotten into that position, I am
   right glad of it! This proves that you are God's child! He has chosen
   you, He loves you, He has given His Son to save you! Take the Lord
   Jesus Christ to be everything to you and go on your way rejoicing!
   "Before faith came," you were shut up, but you were shut up to faith in
   Christ! And now you have that faith, you are shut up no longer, you
   have received the liberty with which Christ makes His people free! Go
   home and enjoy it--and if you meet any other poor soul shut up as you
   were, tell how you came out to liberty! Do not be satisfied to go to
   your bed, tonight, without having told somebody of how the Lord Jesus
   came, dressed in garments dipped in blood, and with His pierced hands
   broke the bars of brass and cut the doors of iron in two--and set your
   soul at liberty, and said, "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your
   transgressions and, as a cloud, your sins." God bless you, for His dear
   Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GALATIANS3.

   Paul, writing, to those changeable Galatians, who had so soon deserted
   the faith, says to them in this chapter.

   Verse 1. O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should
   not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently
   set forth, crucified among you? Paul does not compliment them on being
   a very "thoughtful," "educated," "cultured" people--he does not care
   one atom about that matter but, because they had forsaken the simple
   Truth of the Gospel, he says, "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched
   you?" Those are hard words, Paul! Why did he not say, "Who has led you
   forward into more advanced views?" Not he! He calls it witchery, the
   work of the devil, and it is nothing better--and the wisdom of it is no
   better than the trickery of some old witch. If you take your eyes off
   Christ, it must be witchcraft that makes you do it! There is such
   glory, such beauty, such perfection, such wisdom, such divinity in
   Christ Crucified that if you turn from that sight to anything else, no
   matter how scientific and learned it may be, you are foolish, indeed,
   and somebody has "bewitched you."

   2. This only would I ask of you, Received you the Spirit by the works
   of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? They had gone off into
   legality. They were trying to be saved by ceremonies and by works of
   their own. "Well," asks Paul, "how did you receive the Spirit--the
   Spirit by which miracles were worked among you, the Spirit by which you
   spoke with unknown tongues--the Spirit which changed and renewed your
   hearts? If you did, indeed, receive Him, did you receive Him by the
   works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?" There was only one reply
   to the question--the Spirit came to them as the result offaith!

   3. Are you so foolish, having begun in the Spirit, are you now made
   perfect by the flesh? If the very beginning of your religion was
   spiritual, a work of the Spirit received by faith, are you now going to
   be perfected by the flesh, by outward rites and ceremonies, or by
   efforts of your own?

   4. Have you suffered so many things in vain? If it is yet in vain. You
   had to struggle and endure much contention within your own spirit to
   get upon the ground of faith at all--are you going to throw all that
   away? Is all the experience of your past life to go for nothing and are
   you now going to begin on a lower and baser platform?

   5. Therefore He that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles
   among you, does He do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of
   faith? He knew that they must reply that it was faith and not the works
   of the Law, that gave those miraculous powers!

   6. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
   righteousness. That is the old way, the way of faith! It is not here
   recorded that Abraham did anything, though he did much, but the one
   thing that was "accounted to him for righteousness" was this, that he
   "believed God."

   7. Know you, therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the
   children of Abraham. Not this nation or that, as Anglo-Israelites might
   say, but those that are offaith--these are the children of Abraham!
   Abraham is the father of the faithful, the Believers, and Believers are
   all the children of Abraham! Race has nothing to do with this
   matter--an end has been put to all that. God is not the God of the
   Jews, only, but also of the Gentiles, and here is a new race whose
   distinction is not that they were born of blood, or of the will of the
   flesh, or of the will of man, but by the will of God! This is the token
   by which they are known--they believe God and it is accounted to them
   for righteousness--even as it was accounted to Abraham!

   8. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
   through faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, in you
   shall all nations be blessed. That is the Gospel! And we are blessed by
   it, because we believe in Christ, and so become the children of
   believing Abraham.

   9,10. So then, they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
   For as many as are of the works of the Law are under the curse. All the
   people in the world who think themselves good. All the mere moralists.
   All those who, however amiable they may be, however excellent and
   religious they may be, are trusting to be saved by good works, are all
   under the curse, as surely as the drunkard, the liar, or the swearer is
   under the curse!

   10. For it is written, Cursed is everyone that continues not in all
   things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them. That is all
   that Moses can say to you, and all that the Old Testament can reveal to
   you. Apart from faith in Christ, all its rites and ceremonies, all its
   Laws and precepts, if you are resting in them, can only land you under
   the curse because you cannot continue in all things which are written
   in the Book of the Law to do them! You have not so continued thus
   far--you will not so continue--and nothing but an absolutely perfect
   obedience to the Law could save a man by the way of works! And as that
   obedience is not possible, we come under the curse if we come under the
   Law.

   11. But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God, it is
   evident, for, The just shall live by faith. Here Paul again quotes from
   the Old Testament Scriptures--"The just shall live by faith." Even the
   just man lives by faith! Then how can you, who are not just, expect to
   live in any other way?

   12. And the Law is not of faith, but, The man that does them shall live
   in them. The very spirit of Law is the spirit of works and, as life
   only comes by faith, it cannot come by the works of the Law, for they
   are not of faith! Now comes the Gospel, clear and bright, like the sun
   rising out of a thick fog!

   13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a
   curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is everyone that hangs on a
   tree. Here is Substitution--what else can the words mean? Christ hung
   on a tree for us, bearing our curse, in our place!

   14. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
   Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
   faith. Christ was made a curse for us that the blessing might come upon
   us. He took our curse that we might take the blessing from His own dear
   hands and might possess it forever!

   15. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it is but a man's
   covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no man disannuls, or adds thereto. A
   covenant is a covenant--whatever happens, it cannot be altered--it
   stands, though it were only made by men.

   16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says not,
   And to seeds, as of many; but as of one. And to your seed, which is
   Christ. Quoting from the Old Testament, we may believe in the absolute
   plenary Inspiration of that Sacred Book because the Apostle founds an
   argument upon the singular of a noun having been used rather than the
   plural!

   17. And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God
   in Christ, the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years later,
   cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect. Is not
   that splendid argument? The Covenant was made with Abraham that God
   would bless him and his seed. Well now, 430 years later, the Law was
   given on

   Sinai, but that could not affect a covenant made 430 years before! The
   argument goes to prove that the Covenant of Grace is not affected by
   any Law of rites and ceremonies, no, not even by the Moral Law, itself!
   The Covenant made with Abraham and his seed must stand--the seed
   signifies those who believe, therefore, the Covenant stands fast with
   Abraham and all other Believers.

   18. For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no more of promise: but
   God gave it to Abraham by promise. All through the Book of Genesis, it
   is promise, promise and promise! Isaac was an heir of the promise and
   Jacob was an heir of the promise. In fact, Isaac was born by promise
   and Ishmael, the elder brother, did not inherit the blessing because he
   was born after the flesh. They who believe in Christ are heirs
   according to the promise! Now, a promise takes us out of the region of
   Law.

   19. Why, then, serve the Law? What is the use of it?

   19, 20. It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should
   come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the
   hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is
   One. The Law had its uses, blessed uses. The Law should be used for its
   own purposes and then it is admirable--it is Divine. Take it out of its
   own proper use--make it a master instead of being a servant--and it is
   something like fire, which, in your grate, will comfort you, but if it
   masters you, it burns your house and destroys you!

   21, 22. Is the Law, then, against the promises of God? God forbid: for
   if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily
   righteousness should have been by the Law. But the Scripture has
   concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ
   might be given to them that believe. It shuts you all up as in a
   dungeon, that by the one and only door offaith in Christ you might come
   out into a glorious liberty!

   23, 24. But before faith came we were kept under the Law, shut up unto
   the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Therefore the Law was
   our schoolmaster--This is an unfortunate translation! It should be,
   "The Law was our pedagogue." That was a slave who was employed by the
   father of a family, to take his boy to school and bring him home,
   again. He often was also permitted to whip the boy if he did not learn
   his lessons well. "The Law was our pedagogue"

   24, 25. To bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
   But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. We
   have outgrown him! God has given us power, now, to go to Christ's
   school, ourselves, joyfully and cheerfully! I remember and I daresay
   you do, also, when that pedagogue whipped us very sorely! I am glad
   that I am no longer under his power.

   26,27. For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
   For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
   Christ. You set forth that Truth of God in your Baptism--you then
   confessed that you were dead to sin-- and declared that you were risen
   again in Christ to newness of life. Whatever you had to do with the Law
   before, you were dead and buried to it and to everything but Christ!

   28, 29. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
   there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
   And if you are Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs
   according to the promise. That settles the question! If you belong to
   Christ, you are the children of Abraham! Come, then, and, without the
   least hesitation, claim all the privileges that belong to Abraham's
   seed! If you have come under the promise, enjoy its blessing, and do
   not go back to trusting in rites and ceremonies--or in works of your
   own performing--but live a life of joyous faith in Jesus Christ your
   Lord!

The Sweet and the Sweetener

   (No. 2403)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 10, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   6, 1887.

   "My meditation of Him shall be sweet." Psalm 104:34.

   THOSE OF YOU who were present this morning know that, with all my
   heart, and mind, and soul, and strength, I pleaded with men that they
   would come to Christ. [Sermon # 1951, Volume 33--The Pleading of the
   Last Messenger] If ever in my life I felt that I had spent every
   particle of my strength, I felt it when I had finished that discourse.
   I could have wished to die and end my ministry, with the testimony that
   I bore this morning. I know not in what way I could have more
   completely poured out my whole being in earnest desire for the
   conversion of my fellow men. I thought that it would not be possible
   for me to handle another subject in anything like the same fashion,
   tonight--I did not feel that I could do so. I said to myself,
   therefore, "Instead of preaching, instead of having anything to do that
   will cost much effort and cause much mental strain, I will just be one
   among the people and enjoy myself as a member of the congregation.

   I will have a subject upon which we can all calmly think--I mean, all
   of us who know the Lord"--and it seemed to me as if nothing could be
   more fitting than to think of Him who is the joy of our heart, to
   meditate upon Him who is the strength of our spirit, even our blessed
   Lord, of whom the text says, "My meditation of Him shall be sweet." So,
   then, I am not going to preach at this time--I am just going to lead
   your meditations a little, myself meditating while you meditate, being
   a sort of a leader to pitch the tune in which, I trust, all who love
   the Lord will heartily join. May God the Holy Spirit help us all
   sweetly to meditate upon Him of whom the Psalmist here speaks!

   This 104th Psalm is a very wonderful one. Humboldt wrote a book which
   he called, Cosmos, that is, the world, and this Psalm is a Cosmos--it
   is a world set on fire with praise! It is all creation, from the
   mountain's summit down to the brooks that sparkle through the valleys
   praising God! I have frequently read this Psalm through in the woods
   and on the mountainside and, when we have come home from an excursion
   in the Italian mountains, I have said to my companions, "Now we will
   read the 104th Psalm." It is the naturalist's Psalm! It is the Psalm of
   nature viewed by the eye of faith and he that learns to look aright on
   seas and mountains, on beasts and birds, on sun and moon and stars,
   sees God in all things and says with the Psalmist, "My meditation of
   Him shall be sweet."

   But, Beloved, redemption is a choicer theme for meditation than
   creation is, for its wonders are far greater! I can understand that God
   should make the worlds, but that He should redeem men from eternal
   ruin, I cannot understand. The Creator fashioning all things by the
   Word of His power is nothing like so remarkable an object of meditation
   as that same Creator, veiled in human flesh, yielding His hands to the
   nails of the Cross and bowing His head beneath the stroke of death! If
   creation is marvelous, redemption is a more sublime miracle, a wonder
   in the very center of all wonders!

   Nor is the theme of redemption less vast than that of creation. Truly,
   nature is a very wide theme, from the almost infinite greatness which
   is discovered through the telescope to the wonderful minuteness which
   is perceived through the microscope. Nature seems to have no
   boundaries, yet it is a mere fragment compared with redemption, where
   everything is infinite, where you have to deal with sin and love, life
   and death, eternity and Heaven and Hell, God and man--and the Son of
   God made flesh for man's sake! Now you are among the sublimities,
   indeed, meditating upon redemption-- your theme is vast beyond
   conception!

   And let me add that the theme of redemption is quite as fresh as that
   of nature. Nature, it is true, never grows stale--from the first day of
   the year till the last, it is always young! Did you ever see the ocean
   look twice the same? Did you ever gaze upon the face of nature without
   always perceiving some fresh beauty? And it is just the same with
   redemption. The Cross never grows old! The doctrine of Christ Crucified
   is a spring that wells up forever with a sparkling freshness! Not even
   the eternal ages shall exhaust it--when untold myriads of years have
   passed away, this old, old story of the Cross will still be new!

   There is this much more to say about a meditation upon redemption, that
   it comes closely home to us. I like to think of the stars, but, after
   all, I can be happy if the stars are quenched. I delight to think of
   the rolling ocean, but still, I could rejoice if there were no more
   sea. But in redemption we have a vital and personal interest--we could
   not live as we now live, in the sight of God we could not truly live at
   all--if we had not been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ. The
   seas and the starry worlds are not ours as blessedly as Christ is ours
   and none of them can bring medicine to the heart and joy to the spirit
   as does Jesus, who loved us and gave Himself for us. So I think I may
   say, however excellent the naturalist's meditations are, and the more
   of right meditation upon nature the better--and I wish that we were all
   learned after the order of true science, which deals with nature
   itself, and not with theories--yet, if you know little about these
   things in which some take so deep an interest, your meditations of God
   may be exceedingly sweet! If you stay within the boundaries of
   redemption through Jesus Christ, which are by no means narrow, you may
   say, "My meditation of Him shall be sweet."

   So, first, I shall talk about the sweet--"My meditation of Him shall be
   sweet." Then I shall speak of the sweet as a sweetener, for it is not
   only sweet in itself, but it imparts sweetness--such sweetness as we
   need amid the many bitters of this mortal life.

   I. First, then, let us talk about THE SWEET--"My meditation of Him
   shall be sweet." "Of Him"--that is, of the Well-Beloved of the Father,
   of the Well-Beloved of the Church, of the Well-Beloved of my own
   soul--of Him who loved me, in whose blood I have washed my robes and
   made them white. It is meditation "of Him" that is sweet--not merely of
   doctrine about Him, but of Him, of Himself--"my meditation of Him." Not
   merely of His offices, and His work, and all that concerns Him, but of
   His own dear Self! There lies the sweetness and the closer we come to
   His blessed Person, the more truly have we approached the very center
   of bliss!

   Then it is "meditation of Him" that makes the sweetness! Brothers and
   Sisters, it is very delightful to hear about our Lord. I am sure that I
   have often been charmed when I have heard what others have had to say
   about Him. My hearing of Him is very sweet, but it does not say that in
   our text. It is, "my meditation of Him." When I hear over and over,
   again, in the echoes of my heart, what I have heard with my ears. When,
   like the cattle, having cropped the luscious food, I lie down, as they
   do, to ruminate and chew the cud, "my meditation of Him shall be
   sweet." To think over, again, what I have already thought of. To turn
   over and over in my soul Truths of God with which I am happily
   familiar, which I have tasted and handled many times--just to taste and
   handle them, again--in doing so, "my meditation of Him shall be sweet."
   The more we know of Christ, the more we want to know of Him! And the
   more sweet Christ is to us, already, the more sweet He will be! We can
   never exhaust this gold mine--it gets richer, the deeper we dig into
   it. "My meditation of Him shall be sweet." I will not ask for the
   glowing periods of the orator. I will not wish for the profundities of
   the theologian. I will just sit down, humble as my mind may be, and
   think of what I have heard and known, and especially of all I have
   experienced of my Lord. And "my meditation of Him shall be sweet."

   But let me dwell a minute on that first word--"My meditation of Him
   shall be sweet," Not another man's meditation, which is afterwards
   related to me, but my own meditation of Him shall be sweet! Let me say,
   concerning the wine of communion with Christ, that it is never so sweet
   to a man as when he treads the grapes out himself--"My meditation of
   Him shall be sweet." You get a text and beat out its meaning, "working
   your passage," as we say, into the very soul of it. Then you will
   understand it and you will also enjoy it! Make meditation of Christ to
   be your own personal act and deed! Grasp Him for yourself and hold Him
   by the feet! Put your own finger into the prints of the nails and, out
   of your own heart's experience cry, "My Lord and my God!" Then you
   shall not need that I tell you how sweet such a meditation is, for you
   will be able to say for yourself, "My meditation of Him shall be
   sweet."

   It does not matter, my dear Friend, who you are, if you do but belong
   to Christ, your meditation of Him shall be sweet! You are a very poor
   and illiterate person, perhaps, but, if you know Him, it shall be sweet
   to you to meditate upon Him. Or, it may be you are a man of large
   reading and of wide knowledge. But I am quite sure that there is not in
   all the range of your reading, anything for sweetness comparable to
   Him! The science of Christ Crucified leads the van of all the sciences!
   This is the most excellent of all knowledge--compared with which every
   other knowledge is but ignorance dressed in its best! "My meditation of
   Him shall be sweet"--even mine as I stand here in the midst of you--and
   yours as you sit in those pews. And as you come presently to this Table
   of Communion, I hope each one who meditates on Christ will be able to
   say, "my meditation of Him shall be sweet."

   Now let us meditate on Him for a few minutes and, first, meditate upon
   His Person. This Blessed One, who is verily among us tonight, is God
   and Man. Meditate upon His Manhood. He is of a Nature like your own.
   Sin, alone, excepted, He is a Man as you are. Think of it and rejoice
   that He has so intense a sympathy with you and that you can have so
   intense a sympathy with Him! He is your Brother, though He is also the
   Prince of the kings of the earth! He is your Husband, bone of your bone
   and flesh of your flesh, though He is also "over all, God blessed
   forever." Do not our hearts begin at once to warm towards the Man,
   Christ Jesus--in all our afflictions, afflicted, in all our griefs a
   partaker--and shall not our meditation of Him be sweet?

   But then He is also God, and, as God, He has all dominion and authority
   in Heaven and on earth. Think, then, how near He has brought us to the
   Godhead! There is now no division between a believing man and God--the
   Christ has bridged the chasm between the Creator and the creature! One
   might have thought that this gulf could never have been bridged.
   Between an angry God and a sinner, reconciliation may be made, but
   between a Creator and His creature, what link of union can there be?
   There could have been none if Christ had not become Incarnate! If God
   had not taken Manhood into union with Himself, we could never have been
   brought so near to God as we now are. Angels, you may stand back! You
   can never come so near the Throne of God as man has come, for he was
   made a little lower than the angels, but now, in the Person of Christ,
   He is set in the place of dominion and honor, and made to be master
   over all the works of God's hands! My meditation upon the Divine Person
   of my blessed Master shall be sweet, shall it not? I do but indicate a
   long vista of delight, as it were. I open the gate, and say, "Go in
   there, Friend. You shall find good food for meditation that way."

   Now let us meditate upon our Lord's life, for this meditation shall
   also be sweet. Suppose I take the four Gospels and read the story of my
   blessed Master's existence here among men? Well, it needs meditating
   on, for that life is much more than the Evangelists could write. The
   life of Christ has a wonderful depth in it! The other day I was reading
   aloud the first chapter of Luke's Gospel and trying to expound it. And
   when I came to the close of my meditation, I said to myself, "If I were
   shut up to that one chapter for a whole lifetime, I could never expound
   all its depths." That simple life of Christ, from Nazareth to Golgotha,
   is a life of fathomless deeps! And the more you shall meditate upon it,
   the more sweetness shall you find in it. Oh, to think of His fellowship
   with me if I am poor, for He hungered! His fellowship with me if I am
   weary, for He, "being weary, sat thus on the well"! His fellowship with
   me if I have to stand foot to foot with the old enemy, to contend,
   even, for my life! His fellowship with me if I lie in darkness and in
   the valley of the shadow of death, and have to cry, "My God, my God,
   why have You forsaken me?"

   Read by the eye of faith, the whole story of the life of Christ is full
   of sweetness to the meditative mind, for remember that as He contended,
   He became a conqueror! And in this, too, we shall be like He, for we
   shall overcome through His blood! Faith in Him will give us the
   victory--we shall tread Satan under our feet before the battle is
   finished, even as He has done! My meditation of His woes, coupled with
   my meditation of His ultimate joys shall be exceedingly sweet as a
   prophecy that, if I stoop, I, too, shall conquer--and though I am cast
   down, yet shall my casting down be but the means of lifting me up!

   Now, here is another road for your thoughts to travel. "My meditation
   of Him shall be sweet," especially when I meditate on His death. The
   death of our Lord and Master should be the habitual theme of the
   meditation of God's people. I am afraid, in these days, we do not think
   enough of the Cross and passion of our Divine Redeemer. I read, in the
   "modern thought" papers and reviews, sneers about our "sensuous" hymns
   when we sing about our Lord upon the Cross-- they would have us not
   talk about His blood! Those expressions are "out of date." It is
   "mediaeval," (I think that is the word), to set forth a dying Christ,
   they say! Now, mark you, the strength of the Church of Rome over many
   minds has, for centuries, lain in the fact that she keeps prominent the
   facts of our Lord's passion and death. Perverted as that truth about
   His Cross often is, yet it has salvation in it--and I doubt not that
   many find their way to eternal life, even in that apostate Church, by
   the fact that Christ Crucified is made to be a great reality!

   If it ever comes to pass among us who are called Protestants, and those
   who are called Protestant Dissenters, that the great fact of the death
   of Christ is to be regarded as a kind of myth, out of which certain
   obscure doctrines may be fetched, but which is not, itself, to be
   spoken of, we shall have cut the Achilles tendon of our strength and
   our power to bless the sons of men will have departed! Oh, give me the
   story of the Cross, the veritable story! Yes, let my eyes behold the
   wounds of Jesus as I stand and bow before the Crucified! His death was
   a literal fact--no phantom dream--and so would we hold it! And we would
   meditate upon it as the center of all our hopes. "My meditation of Him
   shall be sweet," is especially true of Christ on Calvary's Cross. Here
   I see Atonement completed, satisfaction rendered, justice honored,
   Grace expounded, love struggling, bleeding, contending, conquering! In
   the actual death of Christ upon the Cross I see the safety of His elect
   whom He has purchased with His precious blood! I see here the ending of
   the reign of evil, the bruising of the old serpent's head. I see the
   great rock on which the kingdom of God is established upon a sure
   foundation sealed with the blood of Christ. Oh, go and live on Calvary,
   you saints! No better air is to be found beneath the cope of Heaven
   and, as you linger there, your meditation on your Lord shall be sweet!

   But what am I saying? For wherever I contemplate the Lord Jesus Christ,
   "my meditation of Him shall be sweet." Follow Him in His Resurrection.
   Behold Him in His present Glory--meditate much upon His intercession at
   the right hand of God. How secure are we because He always lives to
   intercede for us! What prophecies of good things to come are hidden
   away in the Person of our great High Priest before the Throne of God.

   Think, too, of the glory yet to be revealed. "Behold, He comes." Every
   hour is bringing Him nearer! We shall see Him in that Day and though we
   may fall asleep before He comes, yet at His coming He shall raise our
   bodies from the dust and, in our flesh we shall see God! Let us
   meditate much upon the glories of Christ's Second Advent, the
   transcendent splendors of our Divine Conqueror, the background of His
   sufferings only making His triumphs to shine the more brightly!
   Meditate upon these things--give your minds wholly to them--then shall
   you prove the sweetness which dwells in them all.

   If you, who are children of God, do not feel that you could traverse
   any of these paths, I want you to seek to get sweetness out of this
   thought, "HE loves me." Say to yourself, Believer, "If there is never
   another one in Heaven or on earth that loves me, yet Jesus loves me.
   Jesus loves me! It is well-nigh inconceivable, yet is it true."

   II. Now let us turn to the second part of the subject, THE SWEET AS A
   SWEETENER--"My meditation of Him shall be sweet,"

   That is to say, first, it shall sweeten all my other sweetnesses. I
   commend to you who are happy, to you who are full of joy, this blessed
   method of securing to yourselves a continuance of that happiness and in
   such a manner as to prevent its spoiling. If you have honey and your
   hands are full of it, be cautious how you eat it, for you may eat honey
   till you are sick of it! But if you have a great store of honey, put
   something sweeter than honey with it, and then it will not harm you. I
   mean, if God has given you joy in your youth, if you are prospered in
   business, if your house is full of happiness, if your children sing
   about you knee, if you have health and wealth, and your spirit dances
   with joy--all this, by itself, may curdle and spoil. Add to it a sweet
   meditation of your Lord and all will be well, for it is safe to enjoy
   temporal things when we enjoy eternal things more! If you will put
   Christ upon the throne to rule over these good things of yours, then
   all shall be well. But if you dethrone Him to set these things up--then
   they become idols--and "the idols He shall utterly abolish." If you are
   truly His, you shall have great sorrow in the falling of your Dagons,
   but it shall surely come to pass. O cheerful, happy, joyous people, I
   wish there were more of you! I am not condemning your joy--I would
   partake in it--but let the uppermost joy you have always be "Jesus
   Christ, Himself." If the occasion of joy is your marriage, ask Him to
   the wedding, for He will turn the water into wine! If it is your
   prosperity, ask Him to the harvest festival and He will bless your
   storehouse and your barn, and make your mercies to be real blessings to
   you!

   But, dear Friends, I need not say much about this point, because, at
   least to some of us, our very sweet days are not very long or very
   many. The comfort is that this sweetness can sweeten all our bitters.
   There was never yet a bitter in the cup of life but what a meditation
   upon Christ would overcome that bitterness and turn it into sweetness!
   I will suppose that you are, at this time, undergoing personal trials
   of a temporal kind. There are a great many cures for the cares of this
   life which philosophy would suggest, but I suggest none of them to
   you--I prescribe meditation upon Christ! I have already given your many
   hints how the sorrows, the struggles and the conquests of the life of
   Christ may help to sweeten all your conflicts and your struggles. Half
   an hour's communion with the Lord Jesus will take away the keenness of
   all your anxieties. Enter into your chamber, shut the door and begin to
   speak with the Man of Sorrows, and your own sorrows will soon be
   relieved. If you are poor, get to Him who had not where to lay His head
   and you will even seem to be rich as you come back to your place in the
   world! Have you been despised and rejected? Do but look on Him on whom
   men spat, whom they cast out, saying that it was not fit that He should
   live--and you will feel as if you never had true honor except when you
   were, for Christ's sake, despised and dishonored! You will almost feel
   as if it was too great an honor for you to have been contemned for His
   dear sake, who bore the shame and the spitting and the cruel Cross for
   your sake. Yes, the best sweetener of all temporal troubles is a
   meditation upon Christ Jesus our Lord!

   So is it with all the troubles that come of your Christian work and
   service. I do not know how it is with any of my fellow workers, here,
   but I can say this, my work has about it a joy that angels might envy,
   but, at the same time, it has also a sorrow which I would not wish any
   to know if it stood by itself. To preach Christ, oh, what bliss it is!
   To tell of my Master's sweet love and of His power to save the guilty,
   I would be content to stay out of Heaven for seven ages if I might
   always be permitted to do nothing else but preach Christ to perishing
   sinners! But there is the heartbreak which comes with it, often, in
   preparing to preach, lest haply one should not take the right subject,
   or should not have one's heart in a right condition for the handling of
   it.

   Add to that the anxieties that creep over one occupying such a position
   as mine. Standing where I stand tonight and remembering many sorrowful
   histories, many disappointed hopes concerning the condition of many now
   before me, I go home, sometimes, wishing that I could creep into my bed
   and never come out of it again because of my terrible anguish over some
   of you who will, I fear, be eternally lost! As surely as you are here,
   you will be lost unless you turn to Christ! Nothing seems as if it
   could save you--entreaties, invitations, warnings, prayers--all are in
   vain! You are still without God and without Christ--and if you remain
   so, you will be lost--and we cannot bear the thought of it! We cannot
   endure to think that we should preach, and warn, and entreat, and
   invite and yet that it should all end in nothing except that we should
   look from the right hand of the Great Judge and spy you out among those
   to whom He will say, "Depart from Me, you cursed!"

   Truly, there is an awful heartbreak that comes to us when we think of
   these things! And when we see some, who did run well, turning aside.
   Some who held the Truth of God, decrying and denying that Truth. Some
   who once preached it, beginning to preach up the fancies of the age
   instead of the Gospel of all the ages, then our heart is, indeed,
   heavy! But what then? "My meditation of Him shall be sweet!" He is
   still the same God over all, blessed forevermore. He is still exalted a
   Prince and a Savior. Jesus will surely save His own and He will
   overthrow all His adversaries, for, "He shall not fail nor be
   discouraged till He has set judgment in the earth." After all is said
   and done, there is no dishonor possible to Him! It is true that "He
   humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
   Cross," but finish the quotation, "Why God also has highly exalted Him
   and given Him a name which is above every name: that at the name" (or,
   "in the name") "of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven,
   and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue
   should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
   Father." So, my meditation of Him, even amid the anxieties of Christian
   service, shall be exceedingly sweet!

   Yes, Beloved, and it is just the same when you come to the anxieties
   concerning your own spiritual condition. I suppose that the very good,
   "perfect" people we sometimes meet with, or hear of, never get into the
   state I sometimes get into, but I believe that many of you feel, at
   times, cast down and troubled about your own spiritual state. Whether
   men laugh at it or not, I know that many a child of God beside John
   Newton has had to say--

   "'Tis a point I long to know,

   Oft it causes anxious thought,

   Do I love the Lord or no?

   Am I His, or am I not?"

   I venture to say that as this was the question which the Lord, Himself,
   put to Peter, it is, therefore, not a wrong question for us to ask
   ourselves. When darkness veils the skies and the spirit sinks, and a
   sense of sin is more prevalent than the realization of Divine Grace,
   then it is bitterness, indeed! And at such a time, the very best
   sweetener of the waters of Marah is to think of Christ--"My meditation
   of Him shall be sweet." A sinner's Savior-- oh, how sweet He is to such
   a sinner as I! A Savior for those that have no strength--what a
   precious Savior He is to a weak one like myself! A Savior who, though
   we believe not as we ought, still abides faithful--what a dear Savior
   He is to a half-believing one who has to cry, "Lord, I believe, help
   You my unbelief!"

   Let me give you a little piece of advice--do not think of yourself, but
   think of your Lord! Or, if you must think of yourself, for every time
   you give an eye to self, give twice that time to Christ! Then shall
   your meditation of Him be sweet.

   Thus, dear Friends, as long as we live, and when we come to die, our
   meditation of Him shall be sweet! I would not have you fear the
   bitterness of death, any of you, if you are trusting in Jesus. God has
   a wonderful power of strengthening our souls when our bodies grow very
   weak and feeble. I am quite sure that some of my dear Friends were
   never before in such a condition in all their lives as I have seen them
   in when they have evidently been marked for death. The messenger has
   come, and, as John Bunyan puts it, has brought some timely "token" to
   warn the spirit that, in a very short time, it is to appear among the
   shining ones at the right hand of God. I have seen, just then, the
   spirit of the timid grow strangely brave and the spirit of the
   questioning grow singularly assured! The Lord has manifested Himself in
   an unusually gracious way to the poor fluttering heart. Just as the
   dove was about to take its last long flight, it seemed to have its eyes
   strengthened to see the place to which it must fly--and all timidity
   was gone forever. "My meditation of Him shall be sweet."

   When I lie dying, when heart and flesh are failing me, when I shall
   have little else to think of but my Lord and the eternal state, then
   shall thoughts of Him pull up the floodgates of the river of bliss and
   let the very joy of Heaven into my heart! And, by His Grace, I shall be
   eager to be up and away! I shall not dread the pains, and groans, and
   dying strife of which some talk so much--but the sweetness of "my
   meditation of Him" shall make me forget even the bitterness of death,
   itself!

   I have done when I have just given you one more thought. Our text might
   be read thus, "My meditation shall be sweet to Him." We are going to
   uncover the Table of Communion directly. You will have nothing to think
   of but the body and the blood of Him by whose death you live. That
   meditation will, I trust, be very sweet to you, but this fact ought to
   help to make it so--that it will be "sweet to Him." Jesus loves you to
   love Him--and He loves you to think of Him! I know what you have said,
   sometimes. I remember a Christian woman saying to me, "I have often
   wished that I could preach, Sir. I have often wished that I had but
   been a man that I might constantly preach the Gospel." I do not wonder,
   I should marvel, indeed, if a good many Christian people did not say,
   "I wish that I could be a missionary," or, "I wish that I could be a
   poetess, like Miss Havergal, and sweetly sing of Christ." Perhaps you
   cannot do any of those things, but you can meditate on Christ, can you
   not? And your meditation on Him shall be sweet to Him! He will delight
   in your delighting in Him!

   "Oh, but I am a nobody," says one. "I am nothing." I tell even you that
   your meditation of Christ, though it seems not to go very deep, though
   you cannot, perhaps, keep your thoughts together, well--yet that heart
   meditation of yours, which longs to meditate on your Lord and craves to
   know more of Him--is very sweet to Him. Why, you fathers and mothers,
   you know how it is with those little ones of yours--and especially that
   first little one that just begins to talk! It has said nothing but
   nonsense at present, yet you respect the little words, do you not? It
   is a wonderful speech that little boy of yours made--but why do you
   think so much of your child's little thoughts and expressions? Is it
   not because he is your child that you value his words so much?

   Well now, you belong to Christ and because you belong to Him, He
   accepts your meditations because He accepts you! And He takes a delight
   even in those poor broken perplexed thoughts of yours! He knows that if
   you could sing like the seraphim, you would do so. If you could serve
   Him as the angels do, you would. Well, if you cannot do that, you can
   at least meditate on Christ--and your meditation of Him shall be sweet
   to Him. Oh, then, give Him much of it, and God bless you, for His dear
   Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM104.

   I trust that we have already felt something of holy enjoyment while our
   hearts and voices have been praising the Lord our God. Perhaps this
   Psalm may help to keep us in a praising state of mind. First of all,
   David sang of the majesty of God in His works. Then it seems as if the
   spirit of praise within him became like a strong-winged angel and,
   mounting into the sky, he began to soar aloft over the varied
   landscapes of the world until the sun went down. And even then, he
   continued moving along through the darkness till the sun arose again
   and found him still praising his God! We will note, as we read the
   Psalm, this strange, mysterious flight of the spirit of praise.

   Verse 1. Bless the LORD, O my Soul. There is the keynote. Strike it, my
   Brothers and Sisters, each one of you!

   1-3. O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with honor and
   majesty. Who covers Yourself with light as with a garment: who
   stretches out the heavens like a curtain: who lays the beams of His
   chambers in the waters. Or, as we may read it from the Hebrew, "who
   makes His halls in the waters," those mysterious waters above the
   firmament are here pictured as being the cool, retired dwelling place
   of the majestic Deity.

   3. Who makes the clouds His chariot: who walks upon the wings of the
   wind. A masterly picture, as if the Lord stood erect upon the two wings
   of the wind and, as if the wind, like a mighty spirit, went flying
   round the world with the great Jehovah standing upon its wings, and so
   riding along!

   4, 5. Who makes His angels spirits; His ministers a flaming fire: who
   laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed
   forever. Now comes a very graphic description of Noah's flood.

   6. You covered it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood
   above the mountains. What a splendid act of Divine Energy, when the
   waters which, before, like tamed lions, slept in their dens, came
   hungry and fierce and swallowed up the whole earth!

   7, 8. At Your rebuke they fled; at the voice of Your thunder they
   hastened away. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys
   unto the place which You founded for them. At the sound of God's voice,
   those mighty deeps went back in a great hurricane. Anyone who has seen
   water when it is traveling at a great rate, lashed with tempests, will
   have seen it tossed as into mountains and then having huge holes like
   vast valleys in it, so, the waters rose up like mountains and fell down
   like valleys till they found the channels of the deep which God had
   found for them.

   9. You have set a boundary that they may not pass over; that they turn
   not again to cover the earth. Jehovah puts the bit of sand into the
   mouth of the sea and it comes no farther than its appointed boundaries.
   Now you must suppose the Psalmist is leaving the crowded streets and
   the dingy, dusty, smoky haunts of men and flying, on the wings of his
   gratitude and praise, away into the quiet of the fertile country.

   10-12. He sends the springs into the valleys which run among the hills.
   They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench
   their thirst. By them shall the fowls of the Heaven have their
   habitation, which sing among the branches. I know of no place that
   seems to bring out one's joy and praise better than when standing by
   the side of some rippling brook that tumbles down the fissure among the
   rocks and, seeing the animals come to drink, and hearing the birds
   blithely sing among the branches, or hang over and dip into the very
   stream! Even the reading of this Psalm may be like a cool and
   refreshing breeze to you at this time--and your soul may, in
   imagination, fly away with David, as you also praise and bless your
   God!

   13. He waters the hills from His chambers. From those watery halls
   above the firmament He pours down the showers.

   13-15. The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works. He causes
   the grass to grow for the cattle, and herbs for the service of man:
   that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that makes glad
   the heart of man, and oil to make his face shine, and bread which
   strengthens man's heart. The spirit of praise is flying over the fields
   plowed and tilled by man, over the fruitful vineyards red with clusters
   of grapes and over the olive gardens and other places where man's
   handiwork has made the earth fertile. Now the Psalmist mounts still
   higher and gets into the forests.

   16, 17. The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
   which He has planted; where the birds make their nests: as for the
   stork, the fir trees are her house. Flying along over the tops of the
   trees, he looks down among them and he notices the beasts as well as
   the birds

   18. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for
   the conies. So that there is not any part of the earth which is not
   full of God's goodness! Even the rocks, which yield nothing to the
   plow, furnish a refuge for the conies, and the high hills are a home
   for the wild goats, while the fertile earth beneath makes man's heart
   glad. As the spirit of praise flies over the tops of the mountains, the
   sun goes down. The Psalmist witnesses that grand sight, an Eastern
   sunset.

   19, 20. He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going
   down. You make darkness, and it is night. Will he now cease from his
   song? No, for God does not cease to work!

   20, 21. Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. The young
   lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. So that even
   night has its mysterious music and the roaring of the young lions is a
   tribute to the Providence of the good God who cares even for the beasts
   that perish!

   22. The sun arises, they gather themselves together, and lay them down
   in their dens. You see, the Psalmist does not cease his praise, but
   finds a theme for music even in the rest of the beasts.

   23, 24. Man goes forth unto his work and to his labor until the
   evening. O LORD, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom have you made
   them all: the earth is full of Your riches. The Psalmist has made a
   long journey, flying along just where he could see everything upon the
   face of the earth, but he thinks to himself that he has not seen the
   half of God's works, yet, for yonder is the Mediterranean, glistening
   in the morning sunbeams, so he takes another flight.

   25. 26. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
   innumerable, both small and great beasts. There go the ships. That is,
   above the water--while in it--

   26. There is that leviathan, whom You have made to play therein. Some
   mighty fish leaps out of the sea. The Psalmist's eye catches a glimpse
   of it and he puts even that monster into his hymn of praise!

   27. These wait all upon You, that You may give them their meat in due
   season. My Brothers and Sisters, what an idea we have, here, of God
   thus supplying all the creatures of the earth and the sea! They are all
   waiting upon Him--they can go to no other storehouse but His--no other
   granary can supply their needs! Surely, we need not be afraid that He
   will fail us. It He feeds leviathan, with his great needs, and the many
   birds with their little needs, He will not forget His children! He will
   never withhold any real good from them that walk uprightly.

   28. What You give them they gather: You open Your hand, they are filled
   with good. That is all He has to do, you see, just open His hand. If
   that hand were once fast closed, they would all die, but, in order to
   supply the needs of all the creatures He has made, He has only to open
   His hand!

   29. You hide Your face. As if He did but put His hand before the
   brightness of His Countenance--

   29, 30. They are troubled: You take away their breath, they die, and
   return to their dust. You send forth Your Spirit, they are created: and
   You renew the face of the earth. When God takes away the genial light
   of the summer's sun, what multitudes of creatures die! And then, when
   the soft breath of spring blows upon the earth, how soon the multitudes
   of insects come teeming forth! Christian, here is comfort for you! Has
   God withheld His Spirit from you for a little while, and have many of
   your joys and comforts fallen dead? He has only to speak and He can, in
   a moment, renew all your comforts!

   31-35. The glory of the LORD shall endure forever: the LORD shall
   rejoice in His works. He looks on the earth and it trembles: He touches
   the hills and they smoke. I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live:
   I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. My meditation of
   Him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. Let the sinners be
   consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. It seems as
   if the spirit of praise had bred in the Psalmist a spirit of
   indignation against sin. He could no longer have any patience with
   those who would not adore so great and so good a God and, therefore, he
   utters this imprecation upon their heads which is rather a prophecy of
   what will be their doom--"Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth,
   and let the wicked be no more."

   35. Bless you the LORD, O my Soul. Praise you the LORD. Thus the
   Psalmist, like a good musician, ends with the keynote of his song of
   praise--

   "Bless the Lord, O my Soul."

   May each of us say the same!

"A People Prepared for the Lord"

   (No. 2404)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 17, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   13, 1887.

   "To make ready a people prepared for the Lord." Luke 1:17.

   JOHN was the herald of Christ--he was to prepare the way for the coming
   King--but from this text it appears that he was to do more than that.
   He was not only to make the road ready for the Lord, but he was also
   "to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." That was a great work,
   a task in which he would require strength and wisdom greater than his
   own. He would need that the Spirit of God, who was to be given without
   measure to the coming One, should also be, in a measure, within
   himself, if he should really "make ready a people prepared for the
   Lord."

   This is not at all a usual expression. At first sight, it hardly looks
   to us like a Gospel expression. We sang just now--

   "Just as I am--and waiting not

   To rid my soul of one dark blot,

   To You, whose blood can cleanse each spot,

   O Lamb of God, I come."

   We sang over and over again those words, "Just as I am," "Just as I
   am," and we are prone to protest against the idea of being prepared for
   Christ. We constantly preach that no preparation is needed, but that
   men are to come to Jesus just as they are. Yet here is John the Baptist
   set apart, "to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

   The fact is, dear Friends, that to get men to come to Jesus just as
   they are is not an easy thing. To get them to give up the idea of
   preparing, to get them prepared to come without preparing, to get them
   ready to come just as they are--this is the hardest part of our
   work--this is our greatest difficulty. If we came and preached to men
   the necessity of preparation through so many weeks of fasting during a
   long Lent, or through so many days of scourging and penitence, they
   would attend to us at once, for they would be willing enough to make
   any preparation of that kind! But, when we say to them, "Come just as
   you are, with nothing in your hands to buy the mercy of God, with
   nothing wherewith to demand or to deserve it," men want a great deal of
   preparing before they will come to that point! Only the Grace of God,
   working mightily through the Word, by the Spirit, will prepare men to
   come to Christ--prepared by being unprepared so far as any fitness of
   their own is concerned. The only fit state in which they can come is
   that of sinking themselves, abandoning all idea of helping Christ,
   coming in all their natural impotence and guilt and taking Christ to be
   their All in All.

   Beloved Friends, this is the true preparedness of heart for coming to
   Christ--the preparedness of coming to Him just as you are! And it was
   John's business, thus, "to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
   That is also my business at this time. May the good Spirit, who dwelt
   in John the Baptist, work through us, also, that some here may be made
   ready for Christ--"a people prepared for the Lord"! Let us see how John
   carried out his commission. We shall then be better able to understand
   the text.

   I. First, John made ready "a people prepared for the Lord" BY AWAKENING
   THEIR ATTENTION.

   The people were asleep--they had fallen into a condition of religious
   lethargy, when suddenly there stood in their midst a man clothed in
   camel's hair and with a leather girdle about his loins--a Prophet,
   manifestly, by the boldness and truthfulness of his utterances. He
   spoke in such a way that the people in general heard of his speaking
   and they advertised him by saying, the one to the other, "That is a
   strange man who has begun to preach by the River Jordan and whose meat
   is locusts and wild honey."

   The whole style of the man set the people wondering and talking. And
   when they came to listen to him, he did not flatter them! He did not
   utter mere commonplace truths to them, but with burning earnestness he
   drove straight at their hearts and spoke like Elijah, the great Prophet
   of fire, had done in the ages gone by. So he set them thinking. That is
   a great preparation for coming to Christ just as you are, to be set
   a-thinking! We have always hope of men when they once begin to think
   about religion and the things of God. See how the bulk of them hurry on
   with their eyes tightly shut, rushing fast and yet faster, still, down
   to destruction! You cannot make them stop and think. There are
   thousands of men who would almost sooner be whipped than be made to
   think. The last thing to which they will ever come, of themselves, is
   thoughtfulness!

   Let me appeal to some here who are still unconverted. Did you ever give
   the affairs of your soul the benefit of an hour's serious
   consideration? You have your regular time for stocktaking, those of you
   who are in business--do you ever take stock of your spiritual estate? I
   know that you are not such fools as to neglect your ledgers, you cast
   up your accounts to see where you are, financially, but do you cast up
   the account between God and your own soul, and look the matter fairly
   and squarely in the face? Oh, if we could but bring you to do this, we
   would feel that you were being prepared for coming to Christ just as
   you are, for no man will come to Christ while he is utterly careless
   and thoughtless! Faith is a matter of thought--it requires a mind
   awakened from slumber, a mind that has taken wing--and John the Baptist
   did good service for his Master when he startled men into that
   condition and so made them consider their ways.

   He did more than that, for, having first made them think, he preached
   to them a Savior. He told them that One was coming with power to
   baptize them after a higher sort than his baptism. He cried, "Behold
   the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world," and this
   message infused into the people a measure of hope. The poor people
   said, "What shall we do?" for they had a hope that there was something
   to be gained. Even the tax-gatherers, despised as they were, began to
   look up and think that there might be something, even, for them, so
   they said to John, "Master, what shall we do?" And the rough Roman
   soldiers thought, "There may be something for us," so they, also,
   asked," And what shall we do?" John inspired the multitudes with hope.

   It is a very blessed state of mind for a man to get in when he begins
   to hope that he may be saved. Then he will be prepared to come to
   Jesus, just as he is, when he feels that he is not shut up to despair.
   "Oh," says the poor man, "I need not, after all, be lost! I need not
   abide forever under the wrath of God! There is an open door set before
   me, there is a way of mercy, even for me!" I wish it were possible that
   everybody whom I am now addressing had that feeling--it would be part
   of the making ready of "a people prepared for the Lord" when thought
   had blossomed into hope.

   But John led his hearers on further than that, for they began to expect
   something as well as to hope for it. They expected that the Christ
   would speedily come and they expected some great blessings through the
   coming of the Messiah. And oh, when men, after hearing the Gospel, have
   great expectations concerning God and His salvation, surely their
   expectations will not be long disappointed! I remember a man coming,
   one day, to see me. He said that he wished to take a sitting in the
   Tabernacle. He had been hearing me for some time and he wanted to take
   a seat--but he desired to be very honest with me and not to take a seat
   except upon a right understanding. I asked, "What is the difficulty, my
   Friend?" "Well," he replied, "the person who sat next to me on Sunday
   told me that if I became a regular hearer here, you would expect me to
   be converted." "Well," I answered, "that is true, I shall expect it."
   "But," he said, "you do not mean that you will require it of me." "Oh,
   dear no!" I replied, "nothing of the sort. I do not expect you to
   convert yourself, but I hope and trust that you will be converted--that
   is what I mean. I shall expect that God, in His Grace, will meet with
   you and save you."

   "Oh," he said, "I hope that, too! Only I mean that I could not
   guarantee it." "Ah," I said, "I see that you have taken the word,
   'expect,' in the wrong sense, but I think, dear Friend, that if you
   come expecting to be converted, and I preach expecting that you will be
   converted, it is highly probable that it will soon take place." "Oh,"
   he exclaimed, "God grant it!" The good Brother has long since gone to
   Heaven. A very few weeks after our conversation, he came and told me
   that the expectation in which we had united had been fulfilled and he
   trusted that he had found the Savior. When people come really expecting
   a blessing, they will be sure to get it! I believe that some folk go to
   hear ministers with the idea that there will be something to find fault
   with and, of course, they find that it is so. And when people come to
   hear another preacher, with the hope and expectation that God will
   bless them, of course God does bless them. Their expectation is
   Divinely fulfilled! I always have a bright hope that a man will lay
   hold on Christ when he begins to expect to be saved, for he feels,
   then, that the time has come for him to find eternal life. John made
   ready "a people prepared for the Lord" because, first, he led them to
   thought. Next, he led them to hope, and then he led them to
   expectation--and this is a high measure of preparation!

   John did more than this, for he cried, "Repent you: for the Kingdom of
   Heaven is at hand," that is to say, he put a pressure of urgency upon
   the people. A Brother, who is an eminent preacher, but who uses rather
   long words, was explaining to me the benefit of the preaching of Mr.
   Fullerton and Mr. Smith in his place of worship. He said, "I do not
   know exactly why these Brothers were the means of the conversion of
   many in my place whom I had never reached, but I perceived that they
   had the power to precipitate decision." It sounded rather strange, but
   when I thought it over a little while, I rather liked the expression,
   "the power to precipitate decision." That is the power that leads men
   to make up their minds and say, "Yes," or, "No"--to feel that the
   decision has to be made at once and that the putting of it off is
   impossible because it would be a kind of insanity! Now that is the
   meaning of what John said, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand! Repent
   you! He is coming who wields the axe of Divine Justice--bear fruit, or
   else be cut down! He is coming who uses the great winnowing fan--be the
   true wheat, or else be blown away." He put the Truth of God so
   pointedly and so earnestly, that he did, by that means, make ready "a
   people prepared for the Lord."

   II. Now, secondly, John made the people ready for CHRIST BY AWAKENING
   THEIR CONSCIENCES.

   His very first utterance, as I have reminded you, was, "Repent you, for
   the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." "Repent! Repent! Repent!" was John's
   continual cry. This awakened the consciences of his hearers concerning
   their sin. Preaching repentance meant, "You have sinned! Change your
   mind in reference to that sin you have sinned--quit the sin, mourn over
   it, ask forgiveness for it. Repent!" Whenever a man brings to the minds
   of others their sins--when he does it so that they begin to feel that
   they have sinned--then they are being prepared for the Lord, for no man
   will come to the Savior unless he knows that he needs a Savior. And no
   man will feel that he needs a Savior until he feels that he is a
   sinner. Hence it is a real preparation of men for Christ to convince
   them of sin.

   This John did. He brought their sin before them and then he showed them
   their need of cleansing, for he stood by the River Jordan, not with a
   scallop shell, as some depict him, but he stood by the flowing stream
   ready to immerse all those who repented! This was practically saying to
   them, "You need to be washed, you need to be cleansed, and I show you
   this Truth of God as I baptize you with water unto repentance. Be this
   a token to you that there is no entering Heaven in your filthiness, but
   you must first be washed! As your bodies are washed with pure water, so
   must your souls be washed and made clean before you can enter Heaven."
   This was John's plain teaching by his action as well as by his words.

   Then he went very straight to his point of awakening their consciences
   by telling them of their need of a change of life. He said that it was
   no use for them to pretend to grieve over the past and then continue to
   sin in the same fashion. "Bring forth fruits," he said, "meet for
   repentance," or, "answerable to amendment of life," as the margin has
   it. And he took pains to point out what the fruits must be. If they
   were men of greed, they must become generous and give to their needy
   neighbors. If they had been unrighteous and exacting, they must become
   honest. If they had been domineering and brutal, and murmuring, they
   must become contented and quiet, and gentle.

   He not only preached to the multitudes about repentance of sin in
   general, but he pointed out the precise sin of each class of persons
   that came to him and urged them to perform the special duties which
   they had neglected. Now, Brothers and Sisters, I believe, as I have
   often said, that there is no sewing with silk thread, alone--you must
   have a needle as well! You need a sharp needle to, first, draw the
   thread through the material. And so you must preach the Law. You must
   denounce sin and you must individualize and condemn special sins. And
   you must be personal and pointed, or else men will not feel in their
   consciences what you say to them. Conscience is very apt to get seared
   as with a hot iron--to lose sensitiveness--so as to be no use at all as
   a conscience. Some say that conscience is a spark of deity, a divine
   monitor--it is nothing of the sort! In many a man it is almost extinct,
   for it does not act at all! The preacher who would "make ready a people
   prepared for the Lord" must come out with his axe and lay it to the
   root of the trees! He must be definite and distinct in indicating this
   sin and that sin, and crying to all men, "Repent of these sins! Give
   them up! Get clear from them! Be washed from them or else, as God
   lives, when the Christ, Himself, comes, it will not be to save you, but
   to blow you away with His winnowing fan as the chaff is blown into the
   fire!"

   This is "to make ready a people prepared for the Lord"--by their being
   convinced of sin and led to repentance. That, I think, is a second
   meaning clearly illustrated in the ministry of John the Baptist.

   III. But thirdly, John had "to make ready a people prepared for the
   Lord" BY POINTING OUT THE NATURE OF TRUE RELIGION.

   He showed that it did not depend upon external privileges. As soon as
   John began to preach, the men of Jewish race, proud of their pedigree,
   pressed near, and John, with all the courage that a servant of the Lord
   could have, said, "Begin not to say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham
   as our father,' for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to
   raise up children unto Abraham." You see the drift of his preaching, do
   you not? He says, practically, "Men and women, there is no virtue in
   your boasted privileges. There is no merit in your religious descent.
   As for supposing yourselves to be the peculiar people of God, you are
   not to be saved that way. Say not, 'We have Abraham as our father.'"
   Oh, how many hug that idea, "My father was a Christian." Others say,
   "Well, I live in a Christian country." They suppose that there is
   something in the very race from which they have sprung! Away with all
   such notions, for whatever external privileges you may have had, they
   are not sufficient to secure salvation for you!

   Then came the Pharisees and the Sadducees. They were the religious
   people of the time, the great observers of all outward propriety, but
   John taught them that true religion is not the same as official
   pretension. He called them a "generation of vipers." This was very
   disrespectful and very shocking, indeed, on his part! All the
   newspapers of the period, if there had been any, would have cried him
   down for his lack of charity, but he wanted those who came to him to
   understand that true religion was not the same as professing to be
   religious! It was not making broad the borders of their garments. It
   was not wearing a text of Scripture as a phylactery between their eyes.
   It was not making long prayers at the corners of the streets that would
   save them--there must be a thorough change of heart! So John spoke
   right straight out and this, I believe, is a great way of preparing men
   for coming to Christ, when you tell them, "It is not your early
   training, it is not your going to Church or Chapel, it is not your
   infant sprinkling and your confirmation! It is not even your adult
   Baptism, nor your saying prayers and reading the Bible that will save
   you--'you must be born again.' There must be an inward spiritual change
   worked by the Holy Spirit! You must believe in Jesus Christ, whom God
   has sent, and you must so believe in Him as to be made new creatures in
   Him or else you cannot be saved." Now, when men realize that all this
   is true, it startles them out of their false refuges and makes them
   ready to flee to the only true Refuge, so that it is really the way of
   making ready "a people prepared for the Lord."

   While John set forth this matter negatively, putting down all the wrong
   hopes of his hearers, he was exceedingly plain in telling them that the
   way of salvation would involve them in the necessity of being right
   before God. "There," he said, "the proof of a tree's life is its fruit
   and the evidence of your new life will be your good works. 'Now also
   the axe is laid unto the root of the trees and, therefore, every tree
   which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire."
   Unless our religion makes us holy, it has not done anything for us that
   is really worth doing! Unless we hate sin and love righteousness, our
   religion is a sham and a lie! John stated that Truth of God very
   plainly--and that is the way to drive men to Christ.

   He also told them that the trial of a life would be by its weight as
   well as by its fruit. "Look," he said, "at the heap that lies on the
   threshing floor. He that has the fan in his hand begins to winnow it.
   That which is light and chaffy is blown away. That which has wheat in
   it remains on the floor. So," he said, "there must be weight about your
   religion-- stability, reality, sincerity. There must be heart-work in
   it. It must be no pretense. It must be true from beginning to end or
   else it shall be no more use to you than a heap of chaff would avail
   the farmer when it is blown into the fire."

   Then John taught his hearers that Christ, Himself, would be the great
   Trier of human hearts--not ministers or fellow professors, but Christ,
   Himself. When men feel this to be true, then they begin to say to
   themselves, "There is more required than we, at present, possess. There
   is more demanded than we can ever manufacture of ourselves. Let us go
   to Him that has it and ask Him for it. Let us go to Christ, who has
   Grace to bestow upon the poor and needy." This, then, is the way to
   make ready "a people prepared for the Lord," by pointing out to them
   the nature of true religion. That is what I have tried to do, dear
   Hearer. When you know that you cannot save yourself, you sing--

   "Not the labors of my hands

   Can fulfill Your Law's demands.

   Could my zeal no respite know,

   Could my tears forever flow,

   All for sin could not atone." And then you are ready to finish the
   verse by singing--

   "You must save, and You, alone."

   IV. Now. I shall close my discourse by noticing a fourth way in which
   John made ready "a people prepared for the Lord." He did it BY
   DECLARING THE GRACE AND POWER OF JESUS CHRIST.

   My Brothers and Sisters, if I were to preach to you merely to awaken
   your attention, to awaken your consciences to a sense of sin, or simply
   to show you the nature of true religion, yet you would not be prepared
   for Christ unless you also knew something about Him, something about
   His suitableness and His power to save you. So, John preached Jesus
   Christ as a mighty and glorious Savior on whom the Spirit rested. He
   said, when he baptized our Lord, as Jesus came up out of the water, "I
   saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove and it abode upon
   Him. And I knew Him not, but He that sent me to baptize with water, the
   Same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and
   remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the Holy Spirit."
   John boldly preached and told the people that the Spirit of God rested
   upon Jesus Christ, yes, abode upon Him!

   Now, this would lead them to Him, and this should lead you to Him.
   Whatever there is, poor Souls, that you need to make you holy and
   perfect, Christ has it, for the Spirit of God rests on Him and abides
   in Him without measure! If you need the Grace of penitence, Christ has
   it to give to you. If you need the Grace of supplication, He has it to
   give to you. If you need the Grace of faith, He has it! If you need the
   Grace of holiness, He has it. "It pleased the Father that in Him should
   all fullness dwell." "And of His fullness have all we received, and
   Grace for Grace." John taught this to his hearers and I teach it to
   you. There is nothing needed between Hell and Heaven but what is in
   Christ! Nothing needed for the biggest sinner out of Hell to make him
   the biggest saint in Heaven but what Christ has! Nothing needed in any
   hour of temptation, in any time of depression--nothing needed in any
   moment of sickness, or in the article of death, itself--but what it is
   in Christ and, there for you, if you trust Him! If you are willing to
   have it, it is freely presented to you. He who makes you willing to
   receive, is certainly willing to give! If He has emptied you and
   prepared you to receive of His fullness, do not think that He will
   refuse you when you come to Him for it! He has said, "Him that comes to
   Me, I will in no wise cast out."

   Last Sunday morning, I blew the great trumpet in the hope of startling
   some to Christ [Sermon #1951, Volume 33--The Pleading of the Last
   Messenger] On this occasion, I would ring the little silver bell with a
   gentle noise in the hope that some may, by that means, be made willing
   to come to Christ! My Hearer, you can need nothing which Christ does
   not possess--all your requirements are fully met in Him. The Spirit of
   God dwells in Him as a fullness--as an abiding fullness--therefore, do
   but believe in Him! And even that faith He will give you! Do but trust
   Him and you are saved, and fully supplied in Him who can meet all the
   necessities of your case.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, John taught the people this that they might
   be ready for Christ--"a people prepared for the Lord"--for, when men
   begin to see what a Christ, Christ is, what a Savior the Savior is,
   then they are ready to come to Him! And I pray that many of you may so
   come to Him even now.

   John also told his hearers that the Christ whom he preached was able to
   baptize them with the Holy Spirit. "See," he says, "I only plunge you
   in the flowing stream. I can do nothing more for you than dip you in
   this River Jordan, on profession of your repentance of sin. But this
   Savior, this Christ of God, can immerse you into the Spirit of God! He
   can give you of His power to fill you--you can be baptized into the
   Holy Spirit by Him." Do you hear this, Sinner? Jesus Christ can come
   and give you the Holy Spirit in such measure that you shall be baptized
   into Him--

   "Plunged in the Godhead's deepest sea, And lost in His immensity."

   This will make you to be really His and make you truly to live unto
   Him. The very fullness of Grace, then, is with Christ, and He is
   prepared to give it--and this should make men prepared to receive it!
   Did not the poor prodigal son say of the provision in his father's
   house, "There is bread enough and to spare"? It was partly that which
   made him go to his father's house and we may say of the Spirit who is
   in Christ, "There is enough and to spare for every poor sinner who
   comes to Him"--therefore, come along with you--be prepared at once to
   come and receive the Savior!

   Lastly, John said in his preaching, "Behold the Lamb of God which takes
   away the sin of the world." He pointed out Christ as the Sin-Bearer,
   bearing human guilt in His own Person. That is the master key which
   lets men into the Kingdom of Heaven. Oh, how I delight to preach Christ
   as the Substitute, Christ as the atoning Sacrifice! And when you have
   heard Christ preached in that way, it makes you ready--"a people
   prepared for the Lord." How can men come to Christ if they do not know
   what Christ has done for them? If you do not understand that He
   suffered in your place, the Just for the unjust, to bring you to God,
   how can you come to Christ? But when you have learned that holy and
   blessed doctrine of Christ's Propitiation for human sin, why, then, I
   think you will leap at the very sound of it and say, "Yes, I will take
   this Propitiation to be a Sacrifice for me! Blessed Lamb of God--

   'My faith would lay her hands

   On that dear head of Yours

   While like a penitent I stand

   And there confess my sin.'"

   John's preaching Christ was the best way of making ready "a people
   prepared for the Lord," and there is no better way of preparing you to
   come to Jesus. Oh, that God would grant to some of you that
   "precipitation of decision" of which my learned friend spoke! Oh, that
   in some lives the turning point might be reached tonight--the happy
   moment when they should decide for Christ! Lord, decide them! My
   Friend, you have come to the crossroads--perhaps, tonight--if you
   reject the Savior, it will be your last rejection of Him and it will
   finally seal your doom! And I am sure, with no perhaps whatever, that
   if this night you look to Jesus and trust to His finished work, you
   shall be saved and saved forever!

   Here is a text for you--"Whoever shall call on the name of the Lord
   shall be saved." Is not that a wonderful "whoever"? "Whoever shall call
   on the name of the Lord" in believing prayer, asking mercy, trusting
   Christ for mercy, "shall be saved." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
   and you shall be saved." "He that believes on the Son has everlasting
   life." Most of you know these texts by heart--grip them as with hooks
   of steel! If you say that you are hungry and I put a loaf of bread in
   front of you, will you sit and look at it all night? If I meet you in a
   week's time, will you still complain that you are hungry while there is
   the bread, in front of you, still untouched? You deserve to be hungry
   if that is the case! You deserve to be famished to death if the bread,
   being there, you do not take it. Take it and eat it. "May I have it?"
   asks one. Well, you are commanded to have it--this is not a matter that
   is left to your option! "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but
   now commands all men everywhere to repent." Our Lord, Himself, said,
   "Repent, you, and believe the Gospel." It is, therefore, a Gospel
   command that you should repent and believe--and truly you may obey a
   command given by the Lord, Himself! There is no question about your
   permission to obey it--obey it at once and take Christ to yourself!

   "You do not know me," says a sorrowing one over there in the corner,
   "you do not know me, Sir. Otherwise you would not talk so." I do not
   need to know you, but if you were the devil's own, if you would but
   come to Christ, you would be, at once and forever, Christ's own! Though
   you were sunk almost into Hell by a life of horrible crime, yet if you
   will now come and repent of your sin and lay hold on Christ, you shall
   be saved! I do not know how to use language that shall be stronger than
   that, but do not think that I will withdraw it, or qualify it. If I did
   know how to speak in broader terms, even, than those I have used, I
   would so speak! You guiltiest of the guilty, you most condemned of all
   the condemned, for whom the hottest Hell would be your due place, yet
   come and look to Christ, and you shall live, for none are too vile for
   Him to cleanse, none are too guilty for Him to pardon! Oh, that you
   would believe in Jesus while yet the Gospel bell rings out, "mercy,
   mercy, mercy!" God help you to do so, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 155-17,3:1-18.

   Luke 1:5, 6. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a
   certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abia; and his wife
   was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they
   were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and
   ordinances of the Lord, blameless. You have, here, a very interesting
   couple, Zacha-rias and Elizabeth--a priest with a wife. I have often
   marveled why the Church of Rome thinks it wrong that priests should be
   married when it is evident that the priests under the Law were so. The
   priests had grown so numerous that there was not room for them all to
   work at the Temple at one time. They were divided into 24 divisions and
   Zacharias would, therefore, come up to Jerusalem for a fortnight to
   take his share of the service. Zacharias and Elizabeth were notable for
   excellence of character--"They were both righteous before God." Not
   only did they stand high in the esteem of men, but the great God who
   reads the hearts of all and sees how they live in secret, reckoned them
   to be righteous--

   "They were both righteous before God, walking in all the
   commandments"--that is, in the moral precepts of the Law-- "and
   ordinances"--that is in the ceremonial rites--"of the Lord, blameless."

   7-9. And they had no child because Elizabeth was barren, and they both
   were now well advanced in years. And it came to pass that while he
   executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division,
   according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn
   incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord. Certain offices of
   the priest were considered to be more honorable than others and so, to
   prevent any jealousy, they cast lots as to which they should take in
   turn. It fell to the lot of Zacharias to burn incense--this did not
   happen by chance. "The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole
   disposing thereof is of the Lord," and there was a special reason why
   this good man should stand at the altar at this particular time.

   10. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the
   time of incense. While he, in the inner shrine, was burning incense,
   the multitudes in the outer courts were engaging in prayer. I think
   that is a very beautiful symbol--the priest unseen, like the Lord Jesus
   Christ in the Holy of Holies above--and the mass of the people engaged
   in prayer while the unseen priest is offering the sacred perfume before
   the altar of Jehovah.

   11, 12. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on
   the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he
   was troubled, and fear fell upon him. He was a good man, yet he was
   troubled at the sight of an angel. Consciousness of sin, even in an
   outwardly blameless man, makes us all tremble in the presence of
   anything heavenly. This bright spirit had come fresh from the courts of
   God. He was a courtier of the heavenly Temple and he had come down, all
   of a sudden, with a sweet and cheering message for the earthly priest.
   But the priest "was troubled, and fear fell upon him." Brothers and
   Sisters, we cannot know much of Heaven, here below, because it would
   cause us to tremble. We are as yet unfit for all the glories of that
   upper state. Good John Berridge wrote--

   "And now they range the heavenly plains And sing their hymns in melting
   strains. And now their souls begin to prove The heights and depths of
   Jesus' love. Ah, Lord, with tardy steps I creep And sometimes sing, and
   sometimes weep! Yet strip me of this house of clay And I will sing as
   loud as they."

   Yes, and so will we--we will be as much at home as the happy saints who
   dwell in light--when once we are delivered from this hampering flesh
   and blood!

   13. But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias, for your prayer
   is heard. The best quietus to fear is answered prayer! If God has heard
   you, be not you, again, afraid.

   13. And your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call
   his name, John. "The Grace" or, "the gift of God," so the name, "John,"
   signifies. And it is a sweet name for anyone to bear. "You shall call
   his name, John." I do not think the prayer alluded to here was so much
   a prayer for a son. If so, I Think that Zacharias had long ago left off
   praying it, and now his old prayers are heard, after he had
   discontinued them. I think that it alludes, rather, to his prayer for
   the coming of the Christ, the appearance of the Messiah--that prayer
   was heard, as we shall see further on.

   14, 15. And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at
   his birth. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
   drink neither wine nor strong drink. I do not say that it is the duty
   of every man to drink neither wine nor strong drink, but I beg every
   man to notice that if anyone was to be peculiarly consecrated to a holy
   calling, it was always to be so. "He shall be great in the sight of the
   Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink." If there is
   nothing defiling about wine or strong drink, there is certainly nothing
   sanctifying about it--and the tendency seems to lie the other way, else
   it is a strange thing that men dedicated to God were so continually bid
   to drink neither wine nor strong drink.

   15-17. And he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his
   mother's womb. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the
   Lord, their God. And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of
   Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
   disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared
   for the Lord. In the third chapter of this Gospel you will find the
   record of John beginning to fulfill this prophecy concerning himself.

   Luke 3:1-7. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
   Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of
   Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of
   Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, while Annas and
   Caiaphas were high priests, the word of God came unto John, the son of
   Zacharias, in the wilderness. And he came into all the country about
   Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
   as it is written in the Book of the words of Isaiah the Prophet,
   saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way
   of the Lord, make His paths straight. Every valley shall be filled and
   every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be
   made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh
   shall see the salvation of God. Then said he to the multitude that came
   forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you
   to flee from the wrath to come? Does not John the Baptist speak like
   Elijah? Here are no honeyed phrases to delight the popular ear! The
   Prophet of the wilderness talks like one who is all on fire with zeal
   for God and indignation against evil.

   8-11. Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say
   within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say unto you,
   That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And
   now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree,
   therefore, which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast
   into the fire. And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do,
   then? He answered and said to them, He that has two coats, let him
   impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise.
   John was wonderfully practical in his advocacy of a holy charity and
   benevolence. His words cut against all greed, all hoarding, all
   hardening of the heart towards our fellow men.

   12, 13. Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
   Master, what shall we do? And he said unto them, Exact no more than
   that which is appointed you. They were accustomed to gather the taxes
   unfairly and to increase the rates by oppressing the people, getting,
   perhaps, twice or even ten times more out of them than they could
   legally claim! John speaks to the point, does he not?

   14. And the soldiers, likewise, demanded of him, saying, And what shall
   we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man. Those rough Roman
   soldiers, as they had conquered the country, were very apt to treat the
   people as though they were their slaves, so John says to them, "Do
   violence to no man"--

   14. Neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. "With
   your rations, your allowances," so it runs. They were very apt to be
   contending for an increase in their pay and to drag civilians before
   the courts with false accusations unless they chose to give them bribes
   to let them go. John does not mince matters with any of his hearers--he
   speaks with wonderful plainness and courage--and therein proves himself
   to be a true herald of his Master.

   15-18. And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
   their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not, John
   answered, saying unto them all, I, indeed, baptize you with water; but
   One mightier than I comes, the laces of whose shoes I am not worthy to
   unloosen. He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire:
   whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor and
   will gather the wheat into His garner; but the chaff He will burn with
   fire unquenchable. And many other things in his exhortation preached he
   unto the people.

Joy, a Duty

   (No. 2405)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 24, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   20, 1887.

   "Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice." Philippians 4:4

   THERE is a marvelous medicinal power in joy. Most medicines are
   distasteful, but this, which is the best of all medicines, is sweet to
   the taste and comforting to the heart. We noticed, in our reading, that
   there had been a little tiff between two sisters in the Church at
   Philippi--I am glad that we do not know what the quarrel was about. I
   am usually thankful for ignorance on such subjects--but, as a cure for
   disagreements, the Apostle says, "Rejoice in the Lord always." People
   who are very happy, especially those who are very happy in the Lord,
   are not apt either to give offense or to take offense. Their minds are
   so sweetly occupied with higher things that they are not easily
   distracted by the little troubles which naturally arise among such
   imperfect creatures as we are. Joy in the Lord is the cure for all
   discord. Should it not be so? What is this joy but the concord of the
   soul, the accord of the heart, with the joy of Heaven? Joy in the Lord,
   then, drives away the discords of earth.

   Further, Brothers and Sisters, notice that the Apostle, after he had
   said, "Rejoice in the Lord always," commanded the Philippians to be
   careful for nothing, thus implying that joy in the Lord is one of the
   best preparations for the trials of this life. The cure for care is joy
   in the Lord! No, my Brother, you will not be able to keep on with your
   fretfulness. No, my Sister, you will not be able to weary yourself, any
   longer, with your anxieties if the Lord will but fill you with His joy!
   Then, being satisfied with your God, yes, more than satisfied, and
   overflowing with delight in Him, you will say to yourself, "Why are you
   cast down, O my Soul? And why are you disquieted in me? Hope you in
   God, for I shall yet praise Him for the help of His Countenance."

   What is there on earth that is worth fretting for, even, for five
   minutes? If one could gain an imperial crown by a day of care, it would
   be too great an expense for a thing which would bring more care with
   it. Therefore, let us be thankful, let us be joyful in the Lord. I
   count it one of the wisest things that, by rejoicing in the Lord, we
   commence our Heaven here below. It is possible to do so--it is
   profitable to do so--and we are commanded to do so!

   Now I come to the text, itself, "Rejoice in the Lord always; and again
   I say, Rejoice."

   I. It will be our first business at this time to consider THE GRACE
   COMMANDED, this Grace of joy. "Rejoice in the Lord," says the Apostle.

   In the first place, this is a very delightful thing. What a gracious
   God we serve, who makes delight to be a duty and who commands us to
   rejoice! Should we not at once be obedient to such a command as this?
   It is intended that we should be happy. That is the meaning of the
   precept, that we should be cheerful--more than that, that we should be
   thankful! More than that, that we should rejoice! I think this word,
   "rejoice," is almost a French word--it is not only joy, but it is joy
   over again, re-joice! You know re usually signifies the re-duplication
   of a thing, the taking of it over, again. We are to joy, and then we
   are to re-joy. We are to chew the cud of delight--we are to roll the
   dainty morsel under our tongue till we get the very essence out of it!

   "Rejoice." Joy is a delightful thing. You cannot be too happy, Brothers
   and Sisters! No, do not suspect yourself of being wrong because you are
   full of delight. You know it is said of the Divine Wisdom, "Her ways
   are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace." Provided that
   it is joy in the Lord, you cannot have too much of it! The fly is
   drowned in the honey, or the sweet syrup into which he plunges himself,
   but this heavenly syrup of delight will not drown your soul or
   intoxicate your heart! It will do you good, not evil, all the days of
   your life. God never commanded us to do a thing which would harm us
   and, when He bids us rejoice, we may be sure that this is as delightful
   as it is safe, and as safe as it is delightful! Come, Brothers and
   Sisters, I am inviting you, now, to no distasteful duty when, in the
   name of my Master, I say to you, as Paul said to the Philippians under
   the teaching of the Holy Spirit, "Rejoice in the Lord always: and again
   I say, Rejoice."

   But, next, this is a demonstrative duty--"Rejoice in the Lord." There
   may be such a thing as a dumb joy, but I hardly think that it can keep
   dumb long. Joy! Joy! Why, it speaks for itself! It is like a candle
   lighted in a dark chamber--you need not sound a trumpet and say, "Now
   light has come." The candle proclaims itself by its own brilliance and,
   when joy comes into a man, it shines out of his eyes, it sparkles in
   his countenance! There is a something about every limb of the man that
   betokens that his body, like a well-tuned harp, has had its strings put
   in order! Joy--it refreshes the marrow of the bones, it quickens the
   flowing of the blood in the veins--it is a healthy thing in all
   respects. It is a speaking thing, a demonstrative thing and, I am sure
   that joy in the Lord ought to have a tongue! When the Lord sends you
   affliction, Sister, you generally grumble loudly enough. When the Lord
   tries you, my dear Brother, you generally speak fast enough about that.

   Now, when, on the other hand, the Lord multiplies His mercies to you,
   speak about it! Sing about it! I cannot remember, since I was a boy,
   ever seeing in the newspapers, columns of thankfulness and expressions
   of delight about the prosperity of business in England. It is a long,
   long time since I was first able to read newspapers--a great many
   years, now--but I do not remember the paragraphs in which it was said
   that everybody was getting on in the world and growing rich. But as
   soon as there was any depression in business, what gloomy articles
   appeared concerning the dreadful times which had fallen upon the
   agricultural interest and every other interest! Oh, my dear Brothers
   and Sisters, from the way some of you grumble, I might imagine you were
   all ruined if I did not know better! I knew some of you when you were
   not worth two-pence--and you are pretty well-to-do now. You have got on
   uncommonly well for men who are being ruined! From the way some people
   talk, you might imagine that everybody is bankrupt and that we are all
   going to the dogs together! But it is not so and what a pity it is that
   we do not give the Lord some of our praises when we have better times!
   If we are so loud and so eloquent over our present woes, why could we
   not have been as eloquent and as loud in thanksgiving for the blessings
   that God formerly granted to us? Perhaps the mercies buried in oblivion
   have been to Heaven and accused us to the Lord and, therefore, He has
   sent us the sorrows of today. True joy, when it is joy in the Lord,
   must speak--it cannot hold its tongue--it must praise the name of the
   Lord!

   Further, this blessed Grace of joy is very contagious. It is a great
   privilege, I think, to meet a truly happy man, a graciously happy man.
   My mind goes back, at this moment, to that dear man of God who used to
   be with us, years ago, whom we called, "Old Father Dransfield." What a
   lump of sunshine that man was! I think that I never came into this
   place with a heavy heart, but the very sight of him seemed to fill me
   with exhilaration, for his joy was wholly in his God! An old man and
   full of years, but as full of happiness as he was full of days! He was
   always having something to tell you to encourage you. He constantly
   made a discovery of some fresh mercy for which we were again to praise
   God! O dear Brothers and Sisters, let us rejoice in the Lord that we
   may set others rejoicing! One dolorous spirit brings a kind of plague
   into the house--one person who is always wretched seems to stop all the
   birds singing wherever he goes! But, as the birds sing to each other
   and one morning songster quickens all the rest, and sets the groves
   ringing with harmony, so will it be with the happy cheerful spirit of a
   man who obeys the command of the text, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
   This Grace of joy is contagious!

   Besides, dear Brothers and Sisters, joy in the Lord is influential for
   good. I am sure that there is a mighty influence wielded by a
   consistently joyous spirit. See how little children are affected by the
   presence of a happy person! There is much more in the tone of the life
   than there is in the particular fashion of the life. It may be the life
   of one who is very poor, but oh, how poverty is gilded by a cheerful
   spirit! It may be the life of one who is well read and deeply
   instructed, but, oh, if there is a beauty of holiness and a beauty of
   happiness added to the learning, nobody talks about "the blue
   stocking," or, "the bookworm" being dull and heavy! Oh, no, there is a
   charm about holy joy! I wish we had more of it! There are many more
   flies caught with honey than with vinegar and there are many more
   sinners brought to Christ by happy Christians than by doleful
   Christians! Let us sing unto the Lord as long as we live and, perhaps
   some weary sinner who has discovered the emptiness of sinful pleasure,
   will say to himself, "Why, after all, there must be something real
   about the joy of these Christians! Let me go and learn how I may have
   it." And when he comes and sees it in the light of your gladsome
   countenance, he will be likely to learn it, God helping him, so as
   never to forget it. "Rejoice in the Lord always," says the Apostle, for
   joy is a most influential Grace, and every child of God ought to
   possess it in a high degree.

   I want you to notice, dear Friends, that this rejoicing is commanded.
   It is not a matter that is left to your option. It is not set before
   you as a desirable thing which you can do without--it is a positive
   precept of the Holy Spirit to all who are in the Lord--"Rejoice in the
   Lord always." We ought to obey this precept because joy in the Lord
   makes us like God. He is the happy God--ineffable bliss is the
   atmosphere in which He lives and He would have His people to be happy.
   Let the devotees of Baal cut themselves with knives and lancets, and
   make hideous outcries if they will, but the servants of Jehovah must
   not even mar the corners of their beard! Even if they fast, they shall
   anoint their head and wash their face, that they appear not unto men to
   fast, for a joyous God desires a joyous people!

   You are commanded to rejoice, Brothers and Sisters, because this is for
   your profit. Holy joy will oil the wheels of your life's machinery.
   Holy joy will strengthen you for your daily labor. Holy joy will
   beautify you and, as I have already said, give you an influence over
   the lives of others. It is upon this point that I would most of all
   insist--we are commanded to rejoice in the Lord. If you cannot speak
   the Gospel, live the Gospel by your cheerfulness, for what is the
   Gospel? Glad tidings of great joy and you who believe it must show, by
   its effect upon you, that it is glad tidings of great joy to you! I
   believe that a man of God--under trial and difficulty and affliction,
   bearing up, and patiently submitting with holy acquiescence, and still
   rejoicing in God--is a real preacher of the Gospel, preaching with an
   eloquence which is mightier than words can ever be and which will find
   its secret and silent way into the hearts of those who might have
   resisted other arguments! Oh, do, then, listen to the text, for it is a
   command from God--"Rejoice in the Lord always!"

   May I just pause, here, and hand this commandment round to all of you
   who are members of this Church, and to all of you who are truly members
   of Christ? You are bid to rejoice in the Lord always! You are not
   allowed to sit there and fret and fume! You are not permitted to
   complain and groan. Mourner, you are commanded to put on beauty for
   ashes and the oil of joy for mourning! For this purpose your Savior
   came--the Spirit of the Lord is upon Him for this very end, that He
   might make you rejoice! Therefore, sing with the Prophet, "I will
   greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He
   has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with a
   robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments,
   and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels."

   II. Now we come to the second head, on which I will speak but briefly,
   that is, THE JOY DISCRIMINATED-- "Rejoice in the Lord."

   Notice the sphere of this joy. "Rejoice in the Lord." We read in
   Scripture that children are to obey their parents "in the Lord." We
   read of men and women being married "only in the Lord." Now, dear
   Friends, no child of God must go outside that ring, "in the Lord."
   There is where you are, where you ought to be, where you must be. You
   cannot truly rejoice if you get outside that ring and, therefore, see
   that you do nothing which you cannot do "in the Lord." Mind that you
   seek no joy which is not joy in the Lord. If you go after the poisonous
   sweets of this world, woe be to you! Never rejoice in that which is
   sinful, for all such rejoicing is evil. Flee from it--it can do you no
   good. That joy which you cannot share with God is not a right joy for
   you. No! "In the Lord" is the sphere of your joy.

   But I think that the Apostle also means that God is to be the great
   Object of your joy. "Rejoice in the Lord." Rejoice in the Father, your
   Father who is in Heaven, your loving, tender, unchangeable God!
   Rejoice, too, in the Son, your Redeemer, your Brother, the Husband of
   your soul, your Prophet, Priest and King! Rejoice, also, in the Holy
   Spirit, your Quickener, your Comforter, in Him who shall abide with you
   forever. Rejoice in the one God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob--in
   Him delight yourselves, as it is written, "Delight yourself, also, in
   the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart." We cannot
   have too much of this joy in the Lord, for the great Jehovah is our
   exceeding joy! Or if, by, "the Lord," is meant the Lord Jesus, then let
   me invite, persuade, command you to delight in the Lord Jesus,
   Incarnate in your flesh, dead for your sins, risen for your
   justification, gone into Glory claiming victory for you, sitting at the
   right hand of God interceding for you, reigning over all worlds on your
   behalf and soon to come to take you up into His Glory that you may be
   with Him forever! Rejoice in the Lord Jesus! This is a sea of
   delight--blessed are they that dive into its utmost depths!

   Sometimes, Brothers and Sisters, you cannot rejoice in anything else,
   but you can rejoice in the Lord. Then rejoice in Him to the fullest. Do
   not rejoice in your temporal prosperity, for riches take to themselves
   wings and fly away. Do not rejoice, even, in your great successes in
   the work of God. Remember how the 70 disciples came back to Jesus and
   said,

   "Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through Your name," and He
   answered, "Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
   subject unto you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in
   Heaven." Do not rejoice in your privileges--I mean, do not make the
   great joy of your life to be the fact that you are favored with this
   and that external privilege or ordinance--but rejoice in God! He
   changes not. If the Lord is your joy, your joy will never dry up! All
   other things are but for a season, but God is forever and ever. Make
   Him your joy, the whole of your joy, and then let this joy absorb your
   every thought! Be baptized into this joy! Plunge into the deeps of this
   unutterable bliss of joy in

   God!

   III. Thirdly, let us think of THE TIME APPOINTED for this
   rejoicing--"Rejoice in the Lord always."

   "Always." Well, then, that begins at once, certainly. So let us now
   begin to rejoice in the Lord. If any of you have taken a gloomy view of
   religion, I beseech you to throw that gloomy view away at once.
   "Rejoice in the Lord always," therefore, rejoice in the Lord now! I
   recollect what a damper I had, as a young Christian, when I had but
   lately believed in Jesus Christ. I felt that, as the Lord had said, "He
   that believes in Me has everlasting life," I, having believed in Him,
   had everlasting life and I said so, with the greatest joy and delight
   and enthusiasm, to an old Christian man. And he said to me, "Beware of
   presumption! There are a great many who think they have eternal life,
   but who have not got it." That was quite true, but, for all that, is
   there not more presumption in doubting God's promise than there is in
   believing it?

   Is there any presumption in taking God at His Word? Is there not gross
   presumption in hesitating and questioning as to whether these things
   are so or not? If God says that they are so, then they are so, whether
   I feel that they are so or not--and it is my place, as a Believer--to
   accept God's bare Word and rest on it. "We count checks as cash," said
   one who was making up accounts. Good checks are to be counted as cash
   and the promises of God, though as yet unfulfilled, are as good as the
   blessings, themselves, for God cannot lie, or make a promise that He
   will not perform! Let us, therefore, not be afraid of being glad, but
   begin to be glad, at once, if we have, up to now, taken a gloomy view
   of true religion and have been afraid to rejoice.

   When are we to be glad? "Rejoice in the Lord always." That is, when you
   cannot rejoice in anything or anyone but God. When the fig tree does
   not blossom, when there is no fruit on the vine and no herd in the
   stall. When everything withers and decays and perishes. When the worm
   at the root of the gourd has made it die, then rejoice in the Lord!
   When the day darkens into evening and the evening into midnight--and
   the midnight into a sevenfold horror of great darkness--rejoice in the
   Lord! And when that darkness does not clear, but becomes more dense and
   Egyptian. When night succeeds night and neither sun nor moon nor stars
   appear, still rejoice in the Lord always! He who uttered these words
   had been a night and a day in the deep. He had been stoned, he had
   suffered from false brethren. He had been in peril of his life and yet,
   most fittingly do those lips cry out to us, "Rejoice in the Lord
   always!" Yes, at the stake, itself, martyrs have fulfilled this Word of
   God--they clapped their hands amid the fire that was consuming them!
   Therefore, rejoice in the Lord when you cannot rejoice in any other.

   But also take care that you rejoice in the Lord when you have other
   things to rejoice in. When He loads your table with good things and
   your cup is overflowing with blessings, rejoice in Him more than in
   them. Forget not that the Lord, your Shepherd, is better than the green
   pastures and the still waters--rejoice not in the pastures or in the
   waters in comparison with your joy in the Shepherd who gives you all!
   Let us never make gods out of our goods! Let us never allow what God
   gives us to supplant the Giver. Shall the wife love the jewels that her
   husband gave her more than she loves him who gave them to her? That
   were an evil love, or no love at all! So, let us love God, first, and
   rejoice in the Lord always when the day is brightest and multiplied are
   the other joys that He permits us to have.

   "Rejoice in the Lord always." That is, if you have not rejoiced before,
   begin to do so at once. And when you have long rejoiced, keep on at it.
   I have known, sometimes, that things have gone so smoothly that I have
   said, "There will be a check to this prosperity! I know that there
   will. Things cannot go on quite so pleasantly always."--

   "More the treacherous calm I dread Than tempests lowering overhead.'"
   One is apt to spoil his joy by the apprehension that there is some evil
   coming. Now listen to this--"He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
   his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." "Rejoice in the Lord
   always." Do not anticipate trouble. "Sufficient unto the day is the
   evil thereof." Take the good that God provides you and rejoice not
   merely in it, but in Him who provided it. So may you enjoy it without
   fear, for there is good salt with that food which is eaten as coming
   from the hand of God.

   "Rejoice in the Lord always." That is, when you get into company, then
   rejoice in the Lord. Do not be ashamed to let others see that you are
   glad. Rejoice in the Lord, also, when you are alone. I know what
   happens to some of you on Sunday night. You have had such a blessed
   Sabbath and you have gone away from the Lord's Table with the very
   flavor of Heaven in your mouths! And then some of you have had to go
   home where everything is against you. The husband does not receive you
   with any sympathy with your joy, or the father does not welcome you
   with any fellowship in your delight. Well, but still, "Rejoice in the
   Lord always." When you cannot get anybody else to rejoice with you,
   still continue to rejoice! There is a way of looking at everything
   which will show you that the blackest cloud has a silver lining. There
   is a way of looking at all things in the Light of God which will turn
   into sweetness that which otherwise had been bitter as gall!

   I do not know whether any of you keep a quassia cup at home. If you do,
   you know that it is made of wood, and you pour water into the bowl and
   the water turns bitter, directly, before you drink it. You may keep
   this cup as long as you like, but it always embitters the water that is
   put into it. I think that I know some dear Brothers and Sisters who
   always seem to have one of these cups handy. Now, instead of that, I
   want you to buy a cup of another kind that shall make everything sweet,
   whatever it is! Whatever God pleases to pour out of the bowl of
   Providence shall come into your cup and your contentment, your delight
   in God, shall sweeten it all! God bless you, dear Friends, with much of
   this holy joy!

   IV. So now I finish with the fourth head, which is this, THE EMPHASIS
   LAID ON THE COMMAND--"Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say,
   Rejoice." What does that mean, "Again I say, Rejoice"?

   This was, first, to show Paul's love for the Philippians. He wanted
   them to be happy. They had been so kind to him and they had made him so
   happy, that he said, "Oh, dear Brothers, do rejoice! Dear Sisters, do
   rejoice! I say it twice over to you, 'Be happy, be happy,' because I
   love you so much that I am anxious to have you, beyond all things else,
   rejoice in the Lord always."

   I also think that, perhaps, he said it twice over to suggest the
   difficulty of continual joy. It is not so easy as some think to always
   rejoice. It may be for you young people, who are yet strong in limb,
   who have few aches and pains and none of the infirmities of life. It
   may be an easy thing to those placed in easy circumstances, with few
   cares and difficulties. But there are some of God's people who need
   great Grace if they are to rejoice in the Lord always. And the Apostle
   knew that, so he said, "Again I say, Rejoice." He repeats the precept,
   as much as to say, "I know it is a difficult thing and so I the more
   earnestly press it upon you. Again I say, Rejoice."

   I think, too, that he said it twice over, to assert the possibility of
   it. This was as much as if he had said, "I told you to rejoice in the
   Lord always. You opened your eyes and looked with astonishment upon me,
   but, 'Again I say, Rejoice.' It is possible, it is practicable! I have
   not spoken unwisely. I have not told you to do what you never can do,
   but with deliberation I write it down, 'Again I say, Rejoice.' You can
   be happy! God the Holy Spirit can lift you above the doldrums of the
   flesh, and of the world, and of the devil--and you may be enabled to
   live upon the mountain of God beneath the shinings of His face! 'Again
   I say, Rejoice.'"

   Do you not think that this was intended, also, to impress upon them the
   importance of the duty? "Again I say, Rejoice." Some of you will go and
   say, "I do not think that it matters much whether I am happy or not. I
   shall get to Heaven, however gloomy I am, if I am sincere." "No," says
   Paul, "that kind of talk will not do! I cannot have you speak like
   that. Come, I must have you rejoice! I really conceive it to be a
   Christian's bounden duty and so, 'Again, I say, Rejoice.'"

   But do you not think, also, that Paul repeated the command to allow for
   special personal testimony? "Again, I say, Rejoice. I, Paul, a sufferer
   to the utmost extent for Christ's sake, even now an ambassador in
   bonds, shut up in a dungeon--I say to you, Rejoice." Paul was a
   greatly-tried man, but he was a blessedly happy man. There is not one
   of us but would gladly change conditions with Paul, if that were
   possible, now that we see the whole of his life written out. And
   tonight, looking across the ages, over all the scenes of trouble which
   he encountered, he says to us, "Brothers and Sisters, rejoice in the
   Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice."

   Did you ever notice how full of joy this Epistle to the Philippians is?
   Will you spare me just a minute while I get you to run your eyes
   through it to observe what a joyful letter it is? You notice that, in
   the first chapter, Paul gets only as far as the fourth verse when he
   says, "Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
   joy." Now he is in his right vein! He is so glad because of what God
   has done for the Philippians that when he prays for them, he mixes joy
   with his prayer! In the 16th verse he declares that he found joy, even,
   in the opposition of those who preached Christ in order to rival him.
   Hear what he says--"The one preaches Christ of contention, not
   sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: but the other of
   love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel. What then?
   Notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is
   preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice."

   And he does not finish the chapter till, in the 25th verse, he declares
   that he had joy, even, in the expectation of not going to Heaven just
   yet, but living a little longer to do good to these people--"And having
   this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all
   for your furtherance and joy of faith; that your rejoicing may be more
   abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again." You see it
   is joy, joy, joy, joy! Paul seems to go from rung to rung of the ladder
   of the Light of God, as if he were climbing up from Nero's dungeon into
   Heaven, itself, by way of continual joy! So he writes, in the second
   verse of the second chapter, "Fulfill you my joy, that you be
   like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind."
   When he gets to the 16th verse, he says, "That I may rejoice in the Day
   of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain."

   But I am afraid that I should weary you if I went through the Epistle
   thus, slowly, verse by verse. Just notice how he begins the third
   chapter--"Finally, my Brothers and Sisters, rejoice in the Lord." The
   word is sometimes rendered "farewell." When he says, "Rejoice," it is
   the counterpart of, "welcome." We say to a man who comes to our house,
   "Salve"--"Welcome." When he goes away, it is our duty to "speed the
   parting guest" and say, "Farewell." This is what Paul meant to say
   here. "Finally, my Brothers and Sisters, fare you well in the Lord. Be
   happy in the Lord. Rejoice in the Lord." And I do not think that I can
   finish up my sermon better than by saying on this Sabbath night,
   "Finally, my Brothers and Sisters, fare you well, be happy in the
   Lord."--

   "Fareyou well! And if forever, Still forever, fare you well."

   May that be your position, to so walk with God that your fare shall be
   that of angels! May you eat angels' food, the manna of God's love! May
   your drink be from the Rock that flows with a pure stream! So may you
   feed and so may you drink until you come unto the mountain of God,
   where you shall see His face unveiled and, standing in His exceeding
   brightness, shall know His Glory, being glorified with the saved! Till
   then, be happy. Why, even--

   "The thought of such amazing bliss, Should constantjoys create."

   Be happy! If the present is dreary, it will soon be over. Oh, but a
   little while and we shall be transferred from these seats below to the
   thrones above! We shall go from the place of aching brows to the place
   where they all wear crowns! From the place of weary hands to where they
   bear the palm branch of victory! From the place of mistake and error
   and sin, and consequent grief, to the place where they are without
   fault before the Throne of God, for they have washed their robes and
   made them white in the blood of the Lamb!

   Come, then, let us make a solemn league and covenant together in the
   name of God, and let it be called, "The Guild of the Happy," for the--

   "Favorites of the Heavenly King May speak their joys abroad."

   No, they must speak their joys abroad! Let us endeavor to do so,
   always, by the help of the Holy Spirit. Amen and Amen!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PHILIPPIANS4.

   This Epistle was written by Paul when he was in prison with iron
   fetters about his wrists, yet there is no iron in the Epistle. It is
   full of light, life, love and joy--blended with traces of sorrow--yet
   with a holy delight that rises above his grief.

   Verse 1. Therefore, my Brothers and Sisters dearly beloved and longed
   for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
   See how the heart of the Apostle is at work! His emotions are not dried
   up by his personal griefs. He takes a delight in his friends at
   Philippi! He has a lively recollection of the time when he and Silas
   were shut up in prison, there, and that same night baptized the jailor
   and his household--and formed the Church at Philippi!

   2. I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
   mind in the Lord. These two good women had fallen out with one another.
   Paul loves them so much that he would not have any strife in the Church
   to mar its harmony and he, therefore, beseeches both of these good
   women to end their quarrel, and to, "be of the same mind in the Lord."
   You cannot tell what hurt may come to a Church through two members
   being at enmity against each other. They may be unknown persons. They
   may be Christian women, but they can work no end of mischief and,
   therefore, it is a most desirable thing that they should speedily come
   together, again, in peace and unity.

   3. And I entreat you, also, true yokefellow, help those women which
   labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement, also, and with other of my
   fellow laborers, whose names are in the Book of Life. He tenderly
   thinks of all those who had helped the work of the Lord and, in return,
   he would have all of them helped, and kindly remembered, and
   affectionately cherished. May we always have this tender feeling
   towards one another--especially towards those who work for the Lord
   with us! May we always delight in cheering those who serve our Lord!

   4. 5. Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice. Let your
   moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. We have come to
   understand this word, "moderation," in a sense not at all intended
   here. The best translation would probably be, "forbearance." Do not get
   angry with anybody. Do not begin to get fiery and impetuous--be
   forbearing, for the Lord is at hand. You cannot tell how soon He may
   appear. There is no time to spare for the indulgence of anger. Be
   quiet. Be patient and if there is anything very wrong, well, leave it.
   Our Lord Jesus will come very soon, therefore be not impatient.

   6. Be careful--That is, be anxious--

   6. For nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with
   thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. See how the
   Apostle would bid us throw anxiety to the winds--let us try to do so.
   You cannot turn one hair white or black, fret as you may. You cannot
   add a cubit to your stature, be you as anxious as you please. It will
   be for your own advantage and it will be for God's Glory for you to
   shake off the anxieties which otherwise might overshadow your spirit.
   Be anxious about nothing, but prayerful about everything--and be
   thankful about everything as well! Is not that a beautiful trait in
   Paul's character? He is a prisoner at Rome and likely soon to die--yet
   he mingles thanksgiving with his supplication and asks others to do the
   same! We have always something for which to thank God, therefore let us
   also obey the Apostolic injunction.

   7, 8. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep
   your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, Brothers and
   Sisters, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever
   things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely,
   whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if
   there is any praise, think on these things. If there is any really good
   movement in the world, help it, you Christian people! If it is not
   purely and absolutely religious, yet if it tends to the benefit of your
   fellow men, if it promotes honesty, justice, purity, take care that you
   are on that side and do all you can to help it forward.

   9. Those things, which you have both learned and received, and heard,
   and seen in me, do. Paul was a grand preacher to be able to say
   that--to hold up his own example, as well as his own teaching as a
   thing which the people might safely follow!

   9. And the God of peace shall be with you. In the seventh verse, we had
   the expression, "the peace of God." In this ninth verse, we have the
   mention of, "the God of peace." May we first enjoy the peace of God and
   then be helped by the Spirit of God to get into a still higher region
   where we shall be more fully acquainted with the God of peace!

   10. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now, at the last, your
   care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you
   lacked opportunity. "I rejoiced." So Paul was, himself, in a happy
   mood! These saints in Philippi had sent to him in prison a gift by the
   hand of one of their pastors, and Paul, in his deep poverty, had been
   much comforted by their kind thoughtfulness about him.

   11. Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned in whatever
   state I am, therewith to be content. That was not an easy lesson to
   learn, especially when one of those states meant being in prison at
   Rome. If he was ever in the Mammertine, those of us who have been in
   that dungeon would confess that it would take a deal of Grace to make
   us content to be there! And if he was shut up in the prison of the
   Palatine Hill, in the barracks near the morass, it was, to say the
   least, not a desirable place to be. A soldier chained to your hand day
   and night, however good a fellow he may be, does not always make the
   most delightful company for you, nor you for him--and it takes some
   time to learn to be content with such a companion. But, says Paul, "I
   have learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content."

   12. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere
   and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry,
   both to abound and to suffer need. These are both hard lessons to
   learn. I do not know which is the more difficult of the two. Probably
   it is easier to know how to go down than to know how to go up. How many
   Christians have I seen grandly glorifying God in sickness and poverty
   when they have come down in the world, and ah, how often have I seen
   other Christians dishonoring God when they have grown rich, or when
   they have risen to a position of influence among their fellow men!
   These two lessons, Grace, alone, can fully teach us.

   13. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. What a
   gracious attainment! There is no boasting in this declaration. Paul
   only spoke what was literally the truth.

   14. 15. Notwithstanding you have done well, that you did communicate
   with my affliction. Now you Philippians know, also, that in the
   beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church
   communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you, only.
   The Philippians were the only Christians who had sent any help to this
   great sufferer for Christ's sake in the time of his need.

   16-18. For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my
   necessity. Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may
   abound to your account. But I have all and abound: I am full, having
   received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor
   of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. I do
   not suppose that they sent him very much, but he knew the love that
   prompted the gift--he understood what they meant by it. I always had a
   fancy that Lydia was the first to suggest that kind deed. She, the
   first convert of the Philippian Church, thought of Paul, I doubt not,
   and said to the other Believers, "Let us take care of him as far as we
   can. See how he spends his whole life in the Master's service, and now
   he may, at last, die in prison for lack of even common necessities. Let
   us send a present to him in Rome." How grateful is the Apostle for that
   gift of love! What gladness they had put into his heart! Now he says--

   19. But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in
   glory by Christ Jesus. "You have supplied my need out of your poverty.
   My God shall supply all your need out of His riches. Your greatest need
   shall not exceed the liberality of His supplies."

   20. 21. Now unto God and our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
   Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The religion of Christ is full of
   courtesy and it is full of generous thoughtfulness. I do not think that
   he can be a Christian who has no knowledge nor care about his fellow
   Church members.

   21. The Brothers and Sisters which are with me greet you. They saw that
   he was writing a letter and they, therefore, said, "Send our love to
   the Philippians."

   2. All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
   household. Only think of saints in the household of Nero, saints in the
   service of such a demon as he was, and saints who were first in every
   good thing! "Chiefly they that are of Caesar's household."

   23. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

An Appeal to Children of Godly Parents

   (No. 2406)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 31, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   27, 1887.

   "My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of
   your mother: bind them continually upon your heart, and tie them about
   your neck. When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall
   keep you; and when you awake, it shall talk with you. For the
   commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of
   instruction are the way of life." Proverbs 6:20-23.

   You have here, before you, the advice of King Solomon, rightly reckoned
   to be one of the wisest of men, and verily he must be wise, indeed, who
   could excel in wisdom the son of David, the King of Israel. It is worth
   while to listen to what Solomon has to say--it must be good for the
   most intelligent young person to listen--and to listen carefully, to
   what so experienced a man as Solomon has to say to young men. But I
   must remind you that a greater than Solomon is here, for the Spirit of
   God inspired the Proverbs! They are not merely jewels from earthly
   mines, but they are also precious treasures from the heavenly hills, so
   that the advice we have, here, is not only the counsel of a wise man,
   but the advice of that Incarnate Wisdom who speaks to us out of the
   Word of God! Would you become the sons of wisdom? Come and sit at the
   feet of Solomon! Would you become spiritually wise? Come and hear what
   the Spirit of God has to say by the mouth of this wise man!

   In considering this subject, I am going, first of all, to show you that
   true godliness, of which the wise man, here, speaks, comes to many of
   us recommended by parental example--"My son, keep your father's
   commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother: bind them
   continually upon your heart, and tie them about your neck." But, in
   addition to that, true religion comes to us commended by practical
   uses, by its beneficial effect upon our lives--"When you go, it shall
   lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you awake, it
   shall talk with you. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is
   light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life."

   I. Now, in the first place, I want to show you that TRUE RELIGION COMES
   TO MANY OF US RECOMMENDED BY PARENTAL EXAMPLE.

   Unhappily, it is not so with all of you. There are some who had an evil
   example in their childhood and who never learned anything that was good
   from their parents. I adore the sovereignty of Divine Grace that there
   are among us, tonight, many who are the first in their families that
   ever made a profession of faith in Christ. They were born and brought
   up in the midst of everything that was opposed to godliness, yet here
   they are--they can, themselves, hardly tell you how--brought out from
   the world as Abraham was brought from Ur of the Chaldees. The Lord in
   His Grace has taken one of a city and two of a family, and brought them
   to Zion. You, dear Friends, have special cause for thankfulness, but it
   should be a note to be entered in your diary that your children shall
   not be subjected to the same disadvantages as you, yourselves,
   suffered. Since the Lord has looked in love upon you, let your
   households be holiness to the Lord and so bring up your children that
   they shall have every advantage that religious training can give--and
   every opportunity to serve the living God.

   But there are many among us, I believe the larger proportion of those
   gathered here, who have had the immense privilege of godly training.
   Now, to my mind, it seems that a father's experience is the best
   evidence that a young man can have of the truth of anything. My father
   would not say that which was false anywhere to anyone, but I am sure
   that he would not say it to his son and if, after serving God for 50
   years, he has found religion to be a failure, even if he had not the
   courage to communicate it to the whole world, I feel persuaded that he
   would have whispered in my ear, "My son, I have misled you. I was
   mistaken and I have found it out." But when I saw the old man, the
   other day, he had no such information to convey to me. Our conversation
   was concerning the faithfulness of God and he delights to tell of the
   faithfulness of God to him and to his father, my dear grandfather, who
   has now gone up above. How often have they told me that, in a long
   lifetime of testing and proving the promises, they have found them all
   true and they could say, in the language of the hymn--

   "'Tis religion that can give Sweetest pleasures while we live. 'Tis
   religion must supply Solid comfort when we die."

   As for myself, if I had found out that I was mistaken, I would not have
   been so foolish as to rejoice that my sons should follow the same way
   of life, and should addict themselves with all their might to preaching
   the same Truths of God that I delight to proclaim! Dear son, if you
   have a godly father, believe that the religion upon which he has fixed
   his faith is true. He tells you that it is so--he is, at any rate, a
   sincere and honest witness to you. I beseech you, therefore, forsake
   not your father's God.

   Then I think that one of the most tender bonds that can ever bind man
   or woman is the affection of a mother. Many would, perhaps, break away
   from the law of the father--but the love of the mother--who among us
   can break away from that? So, next, a mother's affection is the best of
   arguments. You remember how she prayed for you? Among your earliest
   recollections is that of her taking you between her knees and teaching
   you to say--

   "Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, Look upon a little child."

   Perhaps you have tried to disbelieve, but your mother's firm faith
   prevents it. I have heard of one who said that he could easily have
   been an infidel if it had not been for his mother's life and his
   mother's death. Yes, these are hard arguments to get over and I trust
   that you will not get over them! You remember well her quiet patience
   in the house when there was much that might have ruffled her. You
   remember her gentleness with you when you were going a little wild. You
   hardly know, perhaps, how you cut her to the heart, how her nights were
   sleepless because her boy did not love his mother's God. I charge you,
   by the love you bear her, if you have received any impressions that are
   good, cherish them, and cast them not aside! Or if you have received no
   such impressions, yet at least let the sincerity of your mother, for
   whom it was impossible to have been untrue--let the deep affection of
   your mother, who could not, and would not, betray you into a
   lie--persuade you that there is Truth in this religion which now,
   perhaps, some of your companions are trying to teach you to deride. "My
   son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your
   mother."

   I think that to any young man, or any young woman, also, who has had a
   godly father and mother, the best way of life that they can mark out
   for themselves is to follow the road in which their father's and
   mother's principles would conduct them. Of course, we make great
   advances on the old folks, do we not? The young men are wonderfully
   bright and intelligent, and the old people are a good deal behind them!
   Yes, yes--that is the way we talk before our beards have grown.
   Possibly, when we have more sense, we shall not be quite so conceited.
   At any rate, I, who am not very old, but who dares not, any longer,
   call myself young, venture to say that, for myself, I desire nothing so
   much as to continue the traditions of my household. I wish to find no
   course but that which shall run parallel with that of those who have
   gone before me.

   And I think, dear Friends, that you who have seen the holy and happy
   lives of Christian ancestors will be wise to pause a good deal before
   you begin to make a deviation, either to the right or to the left, from
   the course of those godly ones. I do not believe that he begins life in
   a way which God is likely to bless and which he, himself, will, in the
   long run, judge to be wise, who begins with the notion that he shall
   upset everything--that all that belonged to his godly family shall be
   cast to the winds! I do not seek to have heirlooms of gold or silver
   but, though I die a thousand deaths, I can never give up my father's
   God, my grandfather's God, and his father's God, and his father's God!
   I must hold this to be the chief possession that I have, and I pray
   young men and women to think the same. Do not stain the glorious
   traditions of noble lives that have been handed down to you! Do not
   disgrace your father's shield! Bespatter not the escutcheons of your
   honored predecessors by any sins and transgressions on your part! God
   help you to feel that the best way of leading a noble life will be to
   do as they did who trained you in God's fear!

   Solomon tells us to do two things with the teachings which we have
   learned of our parents. First he says, "Bind them continually upon your
   heart," for they are worthy of loving adherence. Show that you love
   these things by binding them upon your heart. The heart is the vital
   point--let godliness lie there--love the things of God. If we could
   take young men and women and make them professedly religious without
   their truly loving godliness, that would be simply to make them
   hypocrites, which is not what we desire. We do not want you to say that
   you believe what you do not believe, or that you rejoice in what you do
   not rejoice in. But our prayer--and oh, that it might be your prayer,
   too!--is that you may be helped to bind these things about your heart.
   They are worth living for! They are worth dying for! They are worth
   more than all the world besides--the immortal principles of the Divine
   Life which comes from the death of Christ! "Bind them continually upon
   your heart."

   And then Solomon, because he would not have us keep these things secret
   as if we were ashamed of them, adds, "and tie them about your neck,"
   for they are worthy of boldest display. Did you ever see my Lord Mayor
   wearing his chain of office? He is not at all ashamed to wear it. And
   the sheriffs with their badges--I have a lively recollection of the
   enormous size to which those ornaments attain--and they take care to
   wear them, too. Now then, you who have any love to God, tie your
   religion about your neck! Do not be ashamed of it, put it on as an
   ornament, wear it as the mayor does his chain! When you go into
   company, never be ashamed to say that you are a Christian, and if there
   is any company where you cannot go as a Christian, well, do not go
   there at all. Say to yourself, "I will not be where I could not
   introduce my Master. I will not go where He could not go with me." You
   will find that resolve to be a great help to you in the choice of where
   you will go and where you will not go--therefore bind it upon your
   heart, tie it about your neck! God help you to do this and so to follow
   those godly ones who have gone before you!

   I hope that I am not weak in wishing that some here may be touched by
   affection to their parents. I have had very sorrowful sights,
   sometimes, in the course of my ministry. A dear father, an honest,
   upright, godly man, is perhaps present, but he will not mind my saying
   what lines of grief I saw upon his face when he came to say to me, "Oh,
   Sir, my boy is in prison!" I am sure that if his boy could have seen
   his father's face as I saw it, it would have been worse than prison to
   him! I have known young men who have come to this Tabernacle with their
   parents--nice boys, too, they were. And they have gone into employment
   in the city where they have been tempted to steal--and they have
   yielded to the tempter and have lost their character. Sometimes, the
   deficiency has been met and they have been rescued from a criminal's
   career, but, alas, sometimes they have fallen into the hands of a
   wicked woman and then woe betide them!

   Occasionally, it has seemed to be sheer wantonness and wickedness that
   has made them act unrighteously. I wish I could fetch those young
   men--I do not suppose that they are here, tonight--and let them see not
   merely the misery they will bring upon themselves, but show them their
   mother at home when news came that John had lost his job because he had
   been acting dishonestly, or give them a glimpse of their father's face
   when the evil tidings reached him. The poor man stood aghast! He said,
   "There was never a stain upon the character of any of my family,
   before." If the earth had opened under the godly man's feet, or if the
   good mother could have gone down straight into the grave, they would
   have preferred it to the lifelong tribulation which has come upon them!

   Therefore, I charge you, young man, or young woman, do not kill the
   parents who gave you life! Do not disgrace those who brought you up.
   But I pray you, instead thereof, seek the God of your father, and the
   God of your mother, and give yourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   live wholly to Him.

   II. Now I must turn to my second point, which is that TRUE RELIGION
   COMES TO US COMMENDED BY

   PRACTICAL USES. This is a less sentimental argument than the one I have
   been pleading, but, to many, vital godliness appeals because of its
   immense utility in the actual everyday life of men.

   Solomon tells us, first, that true godliness serves us for
   instruction--"For the commandment is a lamp." If you would know all
   that you ought to know, read this Book. If you would know in your heart
   that which shall be for you present and eternal good, love this Book,
   believe the Truths of God it teaches and obey it, "for the commandment
   is a lamp."

   Next, true religion serves us for direction--"and the law is light." If
   we want to know what we should do, we cannot do better than yield
   ourselves up to the guidance of the Divine Spirit and take this Word as
   our map, for--

   "'Tis like the sun, a heavenly light, That guides us all the day And
   through the dangers of the night, A lamp to lead our way."

   Solomon also tells us that true religion guides us under all
   circumstances. He says, in the 22nd verse, that when we are active,
   there is nothing like true godliness to help us--"When you go, it shall
   lead you." He tells us that when we are resting, there is nothing
   better than this for our preservation--"When you sleep, it shall keep
   you." And when we are just waking, there is nothing better than this
   with which to delight the mind--"When you awake, it shall talk with
   you." I do not intend to expand those three thoughts except to say
   this--when you are busiest, you religion shall be your best help. When
   your hands are full of toil and your head is full of thought, nothing
   can do you more service than to have a God to go to, a Savior to trust
   in, a Heaven to look forward to! And when you go to your bed to sleep,
   or to be sick, you can have nothing better to smooth your pillow and to
   give you rest than to know that you are forgiven through the precious
   blood of Christ, and saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation.
   Often, before I fall asleep, I say to myself those words of Watts--

   "Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood, I lay me down to rest, As in
   the embraces of my God, Or on my Sa vior's breast" and there is no more
   delicious sleep in the world than that sleep which, even in dreams,
   keeps near to Christ! Some of us know what it is, even in those
   wanderings of our mind in sleep, not to quit the holy ground of
   communion with our Lord. It is not always so, but it is sometimes so,
   and even then, when the mind has lost power to control its thoughts,
   even the thoughts seem to dance, like Miriam, to the praise of God! Oh,
   happy men, whose religion is their protection even in their sleep!

   And then Solomon says, "when you awake, it shall talk with you." This
   Bible is a wonderful talking book--there is a great mass of blessed
   talk in this precious volume! It has told me a great many of my faults.
   It would tell you yours if you would let it. It has told me much to
   comfort me and it has much to tell you if you will but incline your
   ears to it. It is a book that is wonderfully communicative. It knows
   all about you, all the ins and outs of where you are, and where you
   ought to be. It can tell you everything. The best communion that a man
   can have is when he commences with God in prayer and the reading of the
   Word--"When you awake, it shall talk with you."

   I have hurried over that point because I want to say something else to
   you. Dear Friends, those of you who are unconverted, our great anxiety
   is that you should know the Lord at once. And our reason is this--that
   it will prepare you for the world to come. Whatever that world may be,
   full of vast mysteries, yet no man is so prepared to launch upon the
   unknown sea as the one who is reconciled to God--who believes in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, who trusts Him and rejoices in the pardon of his sin
   through the great Atoning Sacrifice--and experiences in his own heart
   the marvelous change which has made him a new creature in Christ Jesus!
   The great reason, I say again, why we wish to have our dear friends
   converted is that they may be ready for the world to come. You will
   soon die, all of you. I think it was last Sunday evening that there
   sat, in that pew just over there, a friend who was generally here in
   the morning and evening, but on Wednesday he died quite suddenly. He
   appeared to be in good health, but he died at the railway station, away
   from home. That seat where he used to sit ought to have a warning voice
   to all of us, crying aloud, "Prepare to meet your God!" It might have
   been me--it might have been any of these friends around me on the
   platform--it might have been any of you in the congregation. Who can
   tell who will go this week? Probably some one or other of us (our
   number is so large) will be taken away before another Sabbath bell
   shall be heard!

   I think that is a very good reason for seeking the Lord, that you may
   be prepared for eternity. One day this week I saw an aged friend who
   cannot live much longer. She is 86 and her faculties are failing her,
   but she said to me, "I have no fear, I have no fear of death. I am on
   the Rock, I am on the Rock, Christ Jesus. I know whom I have believed
   and I know where I am going." It was delightful to hear the aged saint
   speak like that. And we are always hearing such talk from our dear
   friends when they are going Home--they never seem to have any doubts. I
   have known some who, while they were well, had many doubts, but when
   they came to die, they seemed to have none at all, but were joyously
   confident in Christ.

   But there is another reason why we want our friends converted and that
   is that they may be prepared for this life. I do not know what kind of
   life you have set before yourself. Perhaps I may be addressing some
   young men who are going to the University and they hope to have lives
   consecrated to learning and crowned with honor. Possibly, some here
   have no prospect but that of working hard to earn their bread with the
   sweat of their brow. Some have begun to lay bricks, or to drive the
   plane, or to wield the pen. There are all sorts of ways of mortal life,
   but there is no better provision and preparation for any kind of life
   on earth than to know the Lord and to have a new heart and a right
   spirit! He that rules millions of men will do it better with the Grace
   of God in his heart. And he that had to be a slave would be the happier
   in his lot for having the Grace of God in his heart. You that are old
   and you that are young, you that are masters and you that are
   servants--true religion cannot disqualify you for playing your part
   here in the great drama of life--but the best preparation for that
   part, if it is a part that ought to be played, is to know the Lord and
   feel the power of Divine Grace upon your soul!

   Let me just show you how this is the case. The man who lives before
   God, who calls God his Father and feels the Spirit of God working
   within him a hatred of sin and a love of righteousness, he is the man
   who will be conscientious in the discharge of his duties and, you know,
   that is the kind of man, and the kind of woman, too, that we need
   nowadays. We have so many people who need looking after--if you give
   them anything to do, they will do it quickly enough if you stand and
   look on--but the moment you turn your back, they will do it as
   slovenly, or as slowly and as badly as can be. They are eye-servants
   only. If you were to advertise for an eye-servant, I do not suppose
   anybody would come to you, yet they might come in shoals, for there are
   plenty of them about! Well now, a truly Christian, a man who is really
   converted, sees that he serves God in doing his duty to his fellow men.
   "You, God, see me," is the power that always influences him, and he
   desires to be conscientious in the discharge of his duties whatever
   those duties may be.

   I once told you the story of the servant girl who said that she hoped
   she was converted. Her minister asked her this question, "What evidence
   can you give of your conversion?" She gave this among a great many
   other proofs, but it was not a bad one. She said, "Now, Sir, I always
   sweep under the mats." It was a small matter, but if you carry out in
   daily life that principle of sweeping under the mats, that is the kind
   of thing we need. Many people have a little corner where they stow away
   all the fluff and the dust--and the room looks as if it was nicely
   swept, but it is not. There is a way of doing everything so that
   nothing is really done, but that is not the case where there is Grace
   in the heart. Grace in the heart makes a man feel that he would wish to
   live wholly to God--and serve God in serving man. If you get that
   Grace, you will have a grand preparation for life as well as for death!

   The next thing is that a man who has a new heart has imparted to him a
   purity which preserves him in the midst of temptation. Oh, this
   dreadful city of London! I wonder why God endures the filth of it? I
   frequently converse with good young men who come up from the country to
   their first job in London. And the first week they live in London is a
   revelation to them which makes their hair almost stand on end! They see
   what they never dreamed of. Well now, you young fellows who have just
   come to London--perhaps this is your first Sunday--give yourselves to
   the Lord at once, I pray you! Yield yourselves to Jesus Christ,
   tonight, for another week in London may be your damnation! Only a week
   in London may have led you into acts of impurity that shall ruin you
   forever! Before you have gone into those things, devote yourselves to
   God and to His Christ, so that with pure hearts and with right spirits
   you may be preserved from "the pestilence that walks in darkness, and
   the destruction that wastes at noonday," in this terribly wicked city.

   There is no hope for you young men and young women in this great world
   of wickedness unless your hearts are right towards God. If you go in
   thoroughly to follow the Lamb wherever He goes, He will keep and
   preserve you even to the end. But if you do not give yourselves to the
   Lord, whatever good resolutions you may have formed, you are doomed--I
   am sure you are--to be carried away with the torrents of iniquity that
   run down our streets today! Purity of heart, then, which comes from
   faith in Christ is a splendid preparation for life!

   So also is truthfulness of speech. Oh, what a wretched thing it is when
   people tell lies! Now, the heart that is purified by the Grace of God
   hates the thought of a lie. The man speaks the truth, the whole truth
   and nothing but the truth-- and he is the man who shall pass through
   life unscathed--and shall be honored and, in the long run, successful.
   He may have to suffer for a time through his truthfulness, but, in the
   end, nothing shall clear a way for him so well as being true in thought
   and word and deed. If you love the Lord with all your heart, you will
   also learn honesty in dealing--and that is a grand help in life. I know
   that the trickster does, sometimes, seem to succeed for a time, but
   what is his success? It is a success which is only another name for
   ruin. Oh, dear Sirs, if all men could be made honest, how much more of
   happiness there would be in the world! And the way to be upright among
   men is to be sincere towards God--and to have the Spirit of God
   dwelling within you.

   Again, true religion is of this value, that it comforts a man under
   great troubles. You do not expect many troubles, my young Friend, but
   you will have them! You expect that you will be married and then your
   troubles will be over--but some say that then they begin! I do not
   endorse that statement, but I am sure that they are not over, for there
   is another set of trials that then begin. But you are going to get out
   of your apprenticeship and then it will be all right--will it?

   Journeymen do not always find it so. But you do not mean, always, to be
   a journeyman--you are going to be a little master. Ask the masters
   whether everything is pleasant with them in these times. If you want to
   escape trouble altogether, you had better go up in a balloon--but then
   I am sure that you would be in trouble for fear of going up too high or
   coming down too fast! But troubles will come and what is there that can
   preserve a man in the midst of trouble like feeling that things are
   safe in his Father's hands? If you can say, "I am His child and all
   things are working together for my good. I have committed myself
   entirely into the hands of Him who cannot err and will never do me an
   unkindness," why, Sir, you have on a breastplate which the darts of
   care cannot pierce! You are shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
   peace and you may tread on the briars of the wilderness with unwounded
   feet.

   True religion will also build up in you firmness of character, and that
   is another quality that I want to see in our young people, nowadays. We
   have some splendid men in this place, and some splendid women, too. I
   should not be afraid, if the devil, himself, were to preach here, that
   he would pervert them from the faith. And if all the new heresies that
   can rise were to be proclaimed in their presence, they know too well
   what the Truth of God is ever to be led astray. But, on the other hand,
   we have a number of people who are led by their ears. If I pull their
   ears one way, they come after me. If they happen to go somewhere else
   and somebody pulls their ears the other way, they go after him. There
   are lots of people who never do their own thinking, but put it out, as
   they put out their washing--they do not think of doing it at home!

   Well now, these people are just like the chaff on the threshing floor,
   and when the wind begins to blow, away they go! Do not be like that!
   Dear young sons and daughters of the Church members, here, know the
   Lord! May He reveal Himself to you at once and when you do know Him,
   and get a grip of the Gospel, bind it to your heart and tie it about
   your neck, and say, "Yes, I am going to follow in the footsteps of
   those I love, and especially in the footsteps of the Lord Jesus
   Christ"--

   "'Through floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He
   goes.'"

   God help you to do it! But first believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ--trust yourselves wholly to Him--and He will give you Grace to
   stand fast even to the end!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM119:1-16.

   The first eight verses of this Psalm, in the Hebrew, begin with the
   letter A, and the second eight begin with the letter B. The whole Psalm
   is the good man's alphabet. The Holy Spirit condescended to use these
   expedients to help the memory of the readers of Holy Scripture. We
   should be thankful for this. I have sometimes heard preachers blamed
   for dividing their discourses in such a way as to help the memory of
   their hearers. The preacher may well bear that blame without any
   regret, since the Spirit of God, here, condescends to alliteration and
   to alphabetical arrangement in order to help the memories of readers.
   Thus the Psalm begins

   Verse 1. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of
   the LORD. If there are any people in the world who are blessed, surely
   it must be those who are in God's way and who take care to keep their
   garments unspotted from the world. Oh, if one can feel, at the end of
   every day, "I am undefiled in God's way, and I have walked in His Law,"
   how sweet it is in such a case to fall asleep, not self-righteous and
   boastful, but yet thankful to have been kept from the iniquity that
   abounds in the world! Truly, "blessed are the undefiled in the way."
   Perhaps some of you cannot claim this particular blessing--then
   remember that there is another Psalm (the 32nd ) which begins, "Blessed
   is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered," and that
   blessing is of the same force and of the same sweetness as this one.

   2, 3. Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, and that seek Him
   with the whole heart. They also do no iniquity: they walk in His ways.
   And if we walk in God's ways, He will never require us to do anything
   which is inequitable or unrighteous. No, that life which is made up of
   walking in God's ways will be full of equity and free from iniquity.

   4. You have commanded us to keep Your precepts diligently. We are to be
   as industrious in holiness as grasping men are in business. "You have
   commanded us to keep Your precepts diligently," watchfully, carefully,
   industriously--with all our might.

   5. O that my ways were directed to keep Your statutes! The Psalmist is
   driven to prayer. His admiration of the godly man makes him aspire to
   be like he and then he feels that he cannot attain to that height
   without Divine help. So he cries, "O that my ways were directed to keep
   Your statutes!"

   6. Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all Your
   Commandments. That is a wide expression, "respect unto all Your
   Commandments." There are many men who are willing to keep a part of
   God's Commandments, but they must pick and choose for themselves which
   these shall be. Such are total traitors--there lurks in their heart a
   distinct rebellion against the Lord, for they really presume to be the
   judge of God--by taking exception to this or that command in His Law.
   In their great condescension, they are willing to be obedient in
   certain points, but not in all. Such men have need to be ashamed! But
   the Psalmist could say, "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have
   respect unto all Your Commandments."

   7. I will praise You with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
   learned Your righteous judgments. "I will not praise myself. If I am
   enabled to be holy, that holiness is Your work, and I will praise You
   for it."

   8. I will keep Your statutes: O forsake me not utterly. Whenever you
   make a resolve, accompany it with a prayer. Let this be your
   declaration, "I will keep Your statutes." But pray, "O forsake me not
   utterly," for, otherwise, your resolution will come to nothing. Now
   begins the second octave of the Psalm

   9. How shall a young man cleanse his way? The Psalmist has spoken about
   the holy way. Now he would speak about young men running in it. One of
   the most intense desires of every godly man is that there may be a
   succession of godly men. Oh, that our young men might be good men, so
   that when the old men pass away, the generation following them may be
   as good as their fathers. No, more--that they may be far better! "How
   shall a young man cleanse his way?" Within him are strong passions.
   Around him are fierce temptations--how shall he cleanse his way? There
   are plenty who would defile him! The youth is compassed about with the
   temptations of gaiety and the allurements of folly--"How shall a young
   man cleanse his way?" Here is the answer

   9. By taking heed, thereto, according to Your Word. There is no keeping
   a clean way if you walk with your eyes shut! You must pick your path in
   such a foul road as this--"By taking heed, thereto, according to Your
   Word." Yes, the greatest heed we can take will not keep us out of the
   mire unless God's Word is a continual lamp unto our feet and a constant
   light unto our path. Oh, that every young man here might cleanse his
   way by taking heed, thereto, according to God's Word!

   10. With my whole heart have I sought You. Can you, each one, say,
   "With my whole heart have I sought You"?

   10. O let me not wander from Your Commandments. "For though I have
   sought You with my whole heart, yet my heart may in the future go
   astray. Do not permit it, Lord--do not permit it!" It is a very
   sorrowful thought to me that there are many who once sat in these seats
   and resolved to maintain a holy life, who, nevertheless, are, at this
   moment, in the seat of the scornful--some perhaps in prison, and many
   of them where they ought not to be. They determined to be right, but,
   destitute of Divine Grace, they have gone astray. Therefore, let each
   of us pray, "O let me not wander from Your Commandments." You know what
   John Bradford used to say when he saw a man taken out to be
   hanged--"There goes John Bradford, but for the Grace of God." And when
   you see others wander, you may say the same about yourself, and then
   breathe the prayer, "O let me not wander from Your Commandments."

   11. Your Word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against You.
   An old preacher, in a sermon on this text, divided it thus--"The best
   thing--'Your Word.' In the best place--'have I hid in my heart.' For
   the best of purposes-- 'that I might not sin against You.'" He thus
   gave, in a few words, the very gist of the text.

   12. Blessed are You, O LORD: teach me Your statutes. There is a
   mixture, you see, of prayer and praise. That is the best devotion,
   which contains a happy combination of these two things, prayer and
   praise!

   13. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of Your mouth. I
   must take leave to claim a special property in this text and there are
   some among us, here, following that same holy craft of preaching the
   Divine Word, who can, each one, lay his hand upon his heart and say to
   God, "With my lips have I declared all the judgments of Your mouth."
   This is a happy occupation. If you cannot spend all your lives in it,
   because of other duties, yet, at least in your own family, and as often
   as you have opportunities, use your lips in God's service!

   14. I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, as much as in all
   riches. Not only as much as in riches, but as in all riches. David had
   gathered together a vast sum of money for the building of the House of
   the Lord, but whatever joy he had in those accumulations (and I daresay
   he had great gladness when he thought of the purpose to which all would
   be used) yet, nevertheless, he says, "I have rejoiced in the way of
   Your testimonies, as much as in all riches."

   15. I will meditate in Your precepts, and have respect unto Your ways.
   Blessed meditation! The lack of meditation is one of the faults of the
   days in which we live--we are so very busy that we have not time to
   study God's Word--but the Psalmist said, "I will meditate in Your
   precepts." That is the secret strength--"and have respect unto Your
   ways"-- that is the public result. If we meditated more, we would live
   better. God help us so to do!

   16. I will delight myself in Your statutes: I will not forget Your
   Word. So may each one of us resolve. Amen.

Feeding On a Whole Christ

   (No. 2407)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY APRIL 7, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S DAY, EVENING,
   APRIL 3, 1887.

   "The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and
   eat it with unlea vened bread and bitter herbs. They shall leave none
   of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the
   ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it." Numbers 9:11,12.

   IN great tenderness God permitted the Passover to be kept a second
   time, that those who had unavoidably been defiled at the first
   observance might not be shut out from the memorable and symbolical
   rite. But, although He altered the date of the Passover, He never
   changed the form of it--the Paschal feast was to be the same whenever
   it was celebrated and by whomever it was observed. Whether one family,
   or an Israelite who happened to be a stranger and visitor in the house,
   whoever it might be--kept the Passover--the same regulations were to be
   carefully followed. From this I gather, learning a lesson from the
   type, that, whatever may be the experiences through which we come to
   salvation, Christ is always the same and we must partake of Him in the
   same way. You who have been so defiled that you have, as it were, to
   eat of the second Passover, even at the 11th hour, long after others
   have been feeding on Christ--still there is the same Christ for you as
   there is for those who come at the right time--who seek the Lord early,
   and find Him while yet the dew of their youth is upon them.

   There is none but Jesus for each one of us! There is no way for this
   man, peculiar to himself because of his righteous life, and no way for
   that person, peculiar to himself because of his ungodliness--but for
   the most moral and the most immoral there is the same Savior to be
   received by the same precious faith! Only by the sprinkling of the
   blood of Jesus are we delivered from wrath and only by feeding upon
   Christ can our spiritual life be sustained. There are not two gospels,
   but only one Gospel. There are not two Christ's, but only one Christ!
   There are not two roads to Heaven but only one road to Heaven. Let us
   go together to the Cross, view the one great Sacrifice for sin and, by
   faith, find salvation in

   Him!

   The subject for us to consider at this time will be just this--if we do
   receive Christ, that reception is beautifully expressed and represented
   by feeding upon Him. So, first, we are to feed upon Jesus Christ. The
   Paschal lamb was to be eaten. Secondly, we are to receive Christ and
   feed upon Him as a whole Christ--"They shall leave none of it unto the
   morning, nor break any bone of it." Then, thirdly, we are to receive
   Christ in union with others. It is a very blessed thing when our
   personal reception of Christ, our personal feeding upon Christ, is not
   a solitary act, but is done in company, as when, of old, a whole
   household drew near to feed upon the Paschal lamb.

   I. First, then, WE ARE TO FEED UPON JESUS CHRIST.

   The true reception of Christ is very beautifully expressed by our
   feeding upon Him. The point a sinner longs to know, when he is really
   awakened and his conscience is thoroughly awakened, is first,
   this--"How can I be saved? I know that Christ is a Savior, but how can
   I make Him my Savior? I understand that He has provided an Atonement by
   which sin can be put away--how can that Atonement put my sin away?"

   When the Paschal lamb was killed in the household of the Israelite,
   first the blood was sprinkled on the lintel and two side posts by the
   man who was the head of the household. And as soon as it was sprinkled,
   its virtue operated at on-ce--that house was secure. Next, they must
   bring in this lamb which had been roasted with fire, they must gather
   around the table and all they had to do with it was to eat it. Now,
   eating is such a simple operation that I cannot explain it. I suppose
   that the best way of explaining how to eat would be by eating--and the
   best way of explaining how Christ is to be received is to receive Him!
   Yet, since I am seeking to help some poor troubled one, I must try, if
   I can, to explain what it was to eat the Paschal lamb and what it is to
   receive Christ. I say again, eating the Paschal lamb was a very simple
   process. Moses might have said to a Jew, "That lamb, roast with fire,
   is yours if you will eat it. There is no ceremony to be gone through,
   no incantation to be repeated, no genuflection to be performed. You
   stand at the table, you eat the lamb, and it is yours."

   Now, concerning feeding upon the Lord Jesus Christ, the first thing to
   be done is to receive Him by faith. Receiving is the first part of
   eating. You are hungry, bread is set before you. You put the bread into
   your mouth, you receive it and it becomes yours. So receive the Lord
   Jesus Christ--faith is the mouth by which He is to be received. Believe
   Him--believe what is testified concerning Him in the Word of God. Say
   to yourself, "This record is true, Jesus is the Son of God. He came
   into the world as Man, He lived a holy life. He died a sacrificial
   death--'the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God.' I believe all
   this. I accept it as true, as true to me, and I take it, not into my
   ears only as hearing it, but into my heart as believing it to be
   assuredly the Truth of God whereby, alone, souls can be saved."

   "But suppose I take Him and have no right to Him." Ah, if you once take
   Him, you have Him, right or no right! Have I not often told you that if
   you have eaten a piece of bread, though you had no right to it, it will
   puzzle all the lawyers in the world to get it away from you?
   Possession, in such a case as that, is more than the proverbial nine
   points of the law! Yes, it is all the points of the law, and if you
   take Christ as yours, then you have Christ as yours! Oh, that you would
   grasp Him right now! "Well, but suppose it is not right for me to have
   Christ?" It was never wrong for a poor sinner to take Christ, so have
   Him now! If He is near you, seize Him now! "Lay hold on eternal life,"
   says the Apostle, and if you lay hold on Christ, God will never cry,
   "Hands off!" Be boldly daring for once and you shall not find yourself
   repulsed. The door of mercy is open, enter--and if you are
   repulsed--you will be the first that was ever rejected by Christ,
   whoever you may be! "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved."

   "I have done that," says one. I am very glad if you have, but have you
   really done it? There is a way of believing and yet not truly
   believing. A man believes that such and such a thing is true--at least,
   he says that he does--and yet he may act in such a way as shall prove
   that he does not believe it. You are in your house, in bed and asleep.
   Someone wakes you up by crying out that your house is on fire--and you
   calmly turn over and go to sleep, again. I know, by your action, that
   you could not have believed the report that was brought to you! One
   looks you in the face and tells you that he can see, there, traces of a
   deadly disease, and that, within a short time, you will be dead unless
   you take a certain medicine. Do you tell me you believe that disease to
   be upon you and believe that medicine would heal you if you took
   it--and after telling me that--do you go home and think no more of it?
   Then I know that you have not spoken truly in saying that you believe,
   for true believing would move you to action--you would be seriously
   affected by these things if you believed them to be true.

   Come, then, let me ask you a question. Is sin a reality to you? Do you
   accept the sinner's position and confess that you need a Savior? Do you
   believe that the Son of God has appeared in human form on purpose that
   He might save such as you are? Can you advance one step further and
   say, "I believe in Christ as my Savior"? So far so good--the bread is
   in your mouth!

   In eating, the next thing is that the food should undergo a process of
   digestion. It must lie in the body and be dissolved. So, in order to a
   full reception of Christ, there must be somewhat of digestion by
   meditation. The great Truths of God I have mentioned enter the
   soul--they are turned over in the heart and mind by meditation. We
   think of them, ponder them, consider them--they begin to influence us
   and our mind sets to work upon those Truths, pressing the very juice
   and essence out of them--making us to know their secret virtues and
   powers. O Sirs, there are some of you who will never be saved by Christ
   because you will not think! Unless the Lord Jesus should graciously
   meet with you and, all of a sudden, you should be caused to believe on
   Him--which I pray may be the case--I am afraid that you will certainly
   be lost!

   Some of you are not in a condition to get any good out of hearing the
   Gospel because you do not think of what you hear. You do not lay up in
   your hearts and turn over in your minds what is taught you on the
   Sabbath. Many let the Gospel have a clear thoroughfare, for they allow
   it to go in one ear and out the other and so, Sunday after Sunday, week
   after week, month after month, year after year, with them it is only
   hearing the Gospel and that is all! The Truth of God has no opportunity
   to become food to their spirits, for what they seem to take in, one
   minute, they cast out the next-- and this is not feeding at all--it is
   but folly and mockery!

   Well now, after food has entered the body and has been digested, there
   is a further process. I am not going into any physiological
   discussions, but there is, as you know, the process that is called
   assimilation. Certain vessels within the body perform their various
   functions and so, gradually, the food which has been taken is made to
   nourish the body and build it up. Thus the bread, which, a little while
   ago, was separate from me, becomes inseparable from me--it has been
   taken up into my system and has become part and parcel of myself. This
   is the best form of feeding upon Christ when, having believed the Truth
   about Him, and having thought it over till we have digested it, certain
   secret faculties within our nature take Him up and assimilate Him into
   our spiritual life.

   Look, Sirs, I believe that Christ was the Incarnate Son of God. I do
   not merely believe that as a mere matter of fact, as I might believe
   that there is such a person as the Czar of Russia, but I look to be
   saved by Him who became Man in order that He might save me! Look
   further. I believe that this God Incarnate did bear my sins in His own
   body on the Cross. I look to be forgiven--no, I know that I am
   forgiven--because He took my sin away and ended it so far as I am
   concerned. That is assimilating the great Truth of God of the Atonement
   in the inmost part of my spirit. I do not need to explain the process
   any longer--I want you to put it into practice. Now, Beloved, you who
   have often fed upon Christ, feed on Him, again, at this moment! Think
   of Him as you know Him and try to know more of Him! But what you do
   know of Him, grasp it. Press out of these clusters their sacred juice.
   Draw out of these Truths the Divine support which they are intended to
   give to your spirit. Say, "These Truths of God are mine. I live on
   them, I could die on them, I need nothing better."

   If you really thus feed upon Christ, it will come to this--that Christ
   and you will be one--and none shall be able to separate you from Him,
   or to take Him from you. As the bread or the meat that you may eat
   becomes one with yourself, so will Christ, absorbed into your inmost
   heart by a childlike trust, become vitally and everlastingly part and
   parcel of your own self! And, because He lives, you must also live, for
   He has made you to live and He lives in you!

   I am sure that if you have once learned to feed upon Christ in the way
   I have been describing, you will not object to the "bitter herbs" that
   were to be eaten with the Passover. Oh, no! Those bitter herbs seem to
   give a zest to the feast. I thought to myself, when I was trying to get
   into the soul of this text, "I have my dish of bitter herbs every day."
   They come to me in this form--Christian ministers, whom I have
   educated, forsaking the faith. Christian people, who I thought were
   converted, behaving in an unseemly and ungodly manner. And anxieties
   about many who do not seem to have so much care about their own souls
   as I have concerning them. O Christ, my blessed Master, Your service is
   very sweet because of You, but, in itself, woe is me that ever I was
   born to it! But the regulation is, "With bitter herbs shall you eat
   it," therefore, let us go on with our work and take whatever of
   bitterness accompanies our service. Perhaps some of you get sneered at
   for your religion--that is your dish of bitter herbs. Or it may be that
   you are very poor, or, possibly, the more you know of Christ, the more
   you also know of your own unworthiness, and that knowledge is like
   eating bitter herbs. Very well, thank God that you have Christ, and say
   nothing about the hitter herbs--for if the Israelite who is hungry gets
   a Paschal lamb to feed upon, he may well be content to take the bitter
   herbs with it.

   The Israelites were also to eat the Passover "with unleavened bread."
   Leavened bread is usually considered by our poor fallen nature to be
   more agreeable to our taste, and there is a measure of self-denial
   implied in the putting away of the leaven. Well, we are called to deny
   ourselves for Christ's sake and we would put away all forms of
   sin--everything that is leavened--that we may have our all in Him and
   find everything that delights the palate and charms the spirit in
   Christ alone! Yes, take away your leavened bread with all its
   sweetness, and bring in the bitter herbs and the unleavened bread,
   instead--we will be perfectly satisfied so long as the true Paschal
   Lamb is upon the table and our souls may feed upon Him!

   I will say no more on this first part of my subject, but I pray you, in
   the silence of your spirits, to feed upon Christ Jesus.

   II. This brings me to my second point, which is that WE ARE TO RECEIVE
   CHRIST AS A WHOLE. The Lord said, concerning the Passover, "They shall
   leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it." If we
   receive Christ, we must receive Him as a whole.

   We must receive Christ in the entirety of His Person. There was
   Arias--he would receive Christ as a good man, but not as God. But you
   cannot have Christ at all unless you have Him as a whole. There were
   some who took the opposite side and were willing to receive Christ as
   God, but not as a bleeding, suffering Man. But you cannot receive
   Christ at all if you will not have Him altogether--you must have Him in
   the entirety of His Person--as God and Man, or else you cannot have Him
   at all, and cannot enjoy Him as the food of your soul.

   We must also receive Christ in the entirety of His offices. He has come
   to be a Prophet, Priest and King. Be willing to be instructed by Him,
   to be cleansed by Him, to be ruled by Him--and mark you, you cannot
   have the Priest unless you will also have the Prophet, nor can He be
   your Prophet unless He also becomes your King! A whole Christ in
   undivided honor, accepted as being all that He professes to be--you
   must have Him so or not at all! And you must have a whole Christ as to
   His work. He comes to put away your sin by the shedding of His blood
   and you say, "I will have Him." But listen, He comes to take away your
   sinfulness, and make you holy by the water which flowed with the blood
   from His side. You cannot take justification and omit
   sanctification--you must have both or neither! The Law concerning the
   Passover was, "They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break
   any bone of it." You must have Christ as He is set forth in His Word in
   all parts of His saving work.

   And we must have Christ in all His teachings. It will not do for us to
   say, "I shall believe Christ when He speaks in His Sermon on the Mount
   and teaches us the ethics of ordinary life. But I will not believe Him
   when He opens up the mysteries of His love as He addresses His
   disciples on the way to the Garden of Gethsemane." You cannot have Him
   at all unless you are willing to believe all that He taught as far as
   you know it, and to believe that what He spoke must be true, even
   though, as yet, you do not know it. You must take the Lord Jesus Christ
   to be absolutely Infallible to you-- otherwise you cannot receive Him
   at all.

   You must also take Christ in all His warnings. You must not turn your
   back when He says, "These shall go away into everlasting punishment,"
   and think His language too severe. They who object to one word of
   Christ have really objected to Christ, Himself! As one leak will sink a
   boat, so will one objection to Christ destroy your loyal confidence in
   Him. No, take every Word He says and believe it! Hang your soul upon
   it, knowing that it must be true since the Christ has said it. You must
   leave nothing of this blessed Paschal Lamb--you must break no bone of
   Him!

   So must it be as to Christ in all His commands. It is ours not to
   reason why, but ours to do what He bids us! And we must not say, "This
   is essential and that is non-essential." We must not say, "I will do
   this which He bids me, but I will not do that which He bids me." You
   are not disciples, but rebels, if you act so! You are not His friends,
   but His enemies, if you thus pick and choose which of His commands you
   will obey! How can he be a good soldier who will sometimes obey his
   captain, but will sometimes disobey? Such discipline as that, or
   rather, such lack of discipline, could be tolerated in no host, and it
   will not be endured in the armies of the living God! No, you must take
   a whole Christ in all His commands.

   And it must be just the same as to Christ and His spirit. One says,
   "Christ is very loving and I will be loving, too." You are right in
   saying so, my Brother, but the Christ was very outspoken and very
   uncompromising--will you also be outspoken and uncompromising? If not,
   your loving spirit will go for little, for it will only be a kind of
   pandering to worldliness. The spirit of Christ is a perfect spirit and
   he that has it not is none of His! It is not for us to select one
   quality of His spirit and say, "I will imitate that." No, but as the
   Christ acted at all times, so do you act. As far as you are capable of
   following Him, put your feet down where He puts His feet down. Do what
   He did according to your measure and degree. A whole Christ fully and
   faithfully imitated can alone produce a perfect character!

   Well now, beloved Friends, you see what our orders are, here. We are,
   first, to feed upon Christ and then, next, we are to receive Him as a
   whole. But I regret that there are some persons who do not feed upon a
   whole Christ. Some, alas, will not do so through sheer willfulness.
   They will pick and choose and thus show their self-conceit and their
   rebellion. Do not do so! Do not do so, I beseech you, but feed on the
   whole Christ as the Israelites ate the whole of the Paschal lamb. Some
   are unable through ignorance to feed on a whole Christ. They do not
   know Him, or they would gladly receive Him. Let not ignorance hinder
   any of you from partaking of the sweetest things on the table of God's
   Grace--but say to yourself, "Little as I know, I feel that, if I knew
   more, I would only wish to know what Jesus would teach me. And I yield
   myself up to Him implicitly, even as a blind man yields himself up to
   his guide, and I say to Jesus, "What I know not, teach me.'" In that
   way you will at least be willing to eat the whole Paschal Lamb, even
   though, through ignorance, you do not fully understand what it is to
   receive Him.

   There are some who, through timidity, fail to feed upon a whole Christ.
   They are afraid to take in some of the glorious doctrines which He
   teaches, some of the sweet things of His Everlasting Covenant, some of
   the strong meat of His eternal purposes, some of the fat things full of
   marrow, and the wine upon the lees, well refined. I pray you, shrink
   not back, but, since Christ gives Himself wholly to all His people, if
   there is a precious Covenant Word, feed upon it! If there is a rich
   promise, believe it and enjoy it! Christ denies nothing to His beloved.
   If you really come to His table and desire to have all that there is in
   Him, then take it, and be not afraid! He will never chide you.
   Therefore, come freely to Christ, Beloved. He, Himself, has given the
   invitation--"Eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved."
   Take all of Christ into your soul according to your capacity, till you
   are filled with Him--come joyfully and partake cheerfully of all that
   He freely gives to you--and be not afraid.

   I think that I need not say more than that upon this second point. Only
   I would to God that many here were willing to say, "I will have a whole
   Christ." If you are willing to have Him, He is yours! If you will but
   trust Him, He is yours! There is nothing for you to do but to take Him
   as your hope, to take your supper tonight. Receive Him into yourself to
   be the food of your spirit and He is yours forever!

   III. I must say only just a few sentences on the last point. WE ARE TO
   RECEIVE CHRIST IN UNION WITH OTHERS.

   The Passover was not a solitary meal. A man did not shut himself up and
   have the lamb roasted and set on the table, and try to eat it all
   himself. No, it was a family meal--all who were in the house, of the
   seed of Israel, master and servants, husband and wife and children--all
   came to that table and fed together. Oh, I like to enjoy Christ for
   myself, but if I may not speak for others, I will speak for myself, and
   I must say that I always enjoy the things of God better with you than I
   do alone. There is so much zest about having friends to enjoy Christ
   with us. We can feast upon Him alone, blessed be His name--we know the
   sweetness of solitary fellowship with Christ--but we love, still more,
   to share the blessing with other Christians. I have no wish to go all
   the way to the Celestial City alone! I would much rather go with
   Christiana and Mercy, and all those little ones--the whole family of
   pilgrims--and Mr. Greatheart, and all the rest of them! They had such
   cheery talks together and when they met the giants, if one was a little
   cast down, another brightened him up and encouraged him to play the
   man.

   What a fine thing it was for such a poor creature as Mr. Ready-to-Halt,
   who always went on his crutches, and for poor Little-Faith, and Mr.
   Despondency, and Miss Much Afraid, to get into such good company! It
   would have been a dreary journey to them if they had gone all the way
   to the Celestial City, each one, alone! But when they traveled in such
   good society, you know, they grew merry. You remember that they were so
   jubilant when Giant Despair's head was cut off that Mr. Ready-to-Halt,
   though he had never done such a thing before, danced without his
   crutches! It is wonderful what joy comes out of Christian communion and
   holy fellowship! So it is good that you eat the Passover together, and
   not alone. It is well that you rejoice in Christ in the company of
   others who are rejoicing in Him.

   The first with whom we should receive Christ is our own family. Well,
   then, my Brother, what about the members of your family? Are they all
   converted yet? Are they all saved? If not, breathe a prayer that the
   Lord would bring the rest of them to the Paschal feast. Some of you
   will have to go away, directly, when we remain for the communion. Some
   of you husbands must leave your wives, here, and you will have to go
   home, or go sit up in the gallery among the spectators. Remember that
   there will be no spectators in Heaven! And in that last dividing day,
   it will be an awful thing to be separated eternally from those we love.
   Happiest will it be in Heaven, itself, if we shall all meet there--an
   unbroken family!

   Still, when the Jew met with his family and ate the Paschal supper,
   that was not the greatest joy of it, for he recollected that everywhere
   else, wherever there was an Israelite family, they were all doing the
   same, and that the whole of the chosen people of God were one in
   keeping this commemorative feast! So are all the people of God one in
   Christ Jesus. I like to think that I have fellowship with all the
   saints. I do not object to have fellowship with those who differ from
   me in many respects. I think that there is a communion of saints that
   cannot be limited. If there is the Life of God in you, and there is the
   Life of God in me, you may be mistaken and I may be mistaken upon some
   points, but the one Life in us will make us have communion with Jesus!

   Perhaps you do not obey all Christ's commands and I say to you, "Well,
   then, I will not commune with you." But I cannot help having communion
   with you if you are in the body of Christ! Communion is the pulse of
   the body and unless I cut my finger off, I cannot help having
   fellowship with my finger! It may be very dirty. I may tie a bit of red
   tape round it and say, "There, I will cut you off from fellowship with
   the rest of my body," but it is no use. As long as the body lives, and
   the finger lives, the fellowship must be there--the life-blood must
   continue to flow through it! So, dear Brothers and Sisters, we see many
   saints of God, many whom we believe to be the children of God, who, no
   doubt, are mistaken, and have many faults--and who is there who is not
   mistaken and is without fault?--but if the life of God is in them,
   there is a fellowship beyond all rules and regulations! That is the
   fellowship of the life which is in the Head of the Church! It pulses
   through all the members and must do so evermore.

   I hope to come to the Communion Table, tonight, then, enjoying
   fellowship with all the redeemed of the Lord, both on earth and in
   Heaven! Yes, and with those that have gone from earth hundreds of years
   ago and, by faith, also to enjoy something of fellowship even with
   generations yet unborn that, in the fullness of time, shall come to
   know the Lord.

   Thank God, many of us do know what it is to commune with Christ as well
   as to commune with His people! Both as individuals and as a worshipping
   assembly, we have often proved the sweetness of fellowship with our
   Lord. Sometimes, at that Communion Table, He has been set forth
   manifestly crucified among us. Sometimes, on our bed at night, He has
   spoken with us. I have known what it is to sit up and try not to go to
   sleep lest I should lose the overflowing joy of His Divine Presence. I
   have been afraid, sometimes, to rise from my bed in the morning lest,
   in going downstairs, I should break the spell of conscious fellowship
   with Him! Our Lord Jesus is so near His people and there are times when
   we have such rapt communion with Him that we can truly say that it is
   eternal life! Then do we sing--

   "I stand upon the mount of God,

   With sunlight in my soul.

   I hear the storms in vales beneath,

   I hear the thunders roll!

   But I am calm with You, my God,

   Beneath these glorious skies

   And to the heights on which I stand,

   Nor storms nor clouds can rise.

   Oh, this is life! Oh, this is joy,

   My God, to find You so!

   Your face to see, Your voice to hear,

   And all Your love to know." God grant us more of that blessed
   fellowship, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: NUMBERS9.

   Verses 1, 2. And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
   in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the
   land of Egypt, saying, Let the children of Israel also keep the
   Passover at his appointed season. I should almost fear that they had
   omitted the keeping of the Passover for a year. There was a first
   celebration of it when they came out of Egypt, but then it was not so
   much a type as a matter of fact--it was the thing itself--not the
   remembrance of the coming out of Egypt, but the actual coming out, the
   exodus. One would gather from this command of the Lord that, on the
   first anniversary of that memorable season, the children of Israel had
   omitted its observance and, therefore, Jehovah said to Moses, "Let the
   children of Israel also keep the Passover at his appointed season." If
   this conjecture is correct, it is very significant that a rite which
   belonged to the Law of God and was, therefore, to pass away, was so
   soon neglected--and certainly it was afterwards neglected for many,
   many years. Whereas, the great memorial ordinance of the Christian
   dispensation--the Lord's Supper--was not neglected even when Christians
   were under fierce persecution from the Jews or other nations. When the
   observance of that rite among the heathen was pretty sure to bring
   death, yet Christians met together on the first day of the week and
   continually broke bread in remembrance of their Lord's death, even as
   we do to this day. I suppose that the Supper, which is the memorial of
   Christ our Passover, has never been altogether neglected throughout the
   world, but has been a matter of constant observation in the Church of
   Christ and shall be "till He come."

   3-7. in the fourteenth day of this month, at even, you shall keep it in
   his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according
   to all the ceremonies thereof, shall you keep it. And Moses spoke unto
   the children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover. And they
   kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in
   the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded
   Moses, so did the children of Israel. And there were certain seen, who
   were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the
   Passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on
   that day: and those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body
   of a man: therefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering
   of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? They
   were in a great difficulty. They were commanded to come to the
   Passover--they sinned if they did not come--but they had defiled
   themselves, either through accident or of necessity. And if they came,
   thus, to the Passover, they would be committing sin, so that either way
   they were in an ill case. There must be somebody to bury the dead. I
   suppose that these persons had fulfilled that necessary office, and
   there had not been time for them to purge themselves from the
   ceremonial defilement involved in the touching of the dead--so what
   were they to do?

   8. And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD
   will command concerning you. Oh, how wisely we would give advice if we
   would never decide till we had prayed about the matter! Possibly we
   think ourselves so experienced and so well acquainted with the mind of
   God, that we can answer off-hand. Or, perhaps, we think that we need
   not consult the Lord at all, but that our own opinion will be a
   sufficient guide. Moses was greater and wiser than we are--he said to
   these men--"Stand still, and I will hear what Jehovah will command
   concerning you."

   9-12. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of
   Israel, saying, If any man of you or your posterity shall be unclean by
   reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep
   the Passover unto the LORD. The fourteenth day of the second month at
   even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter
   herbs. They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone
   of it: according to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep
   it. So that provision was made for the holding of a second Passover,
   that persons who were defiled at the first observance might have the
   opportunity to keep the feast a month afterwards.

   13. But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and does not
   keep the Passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his
   people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his
   appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. What a solemn sentence
   that is! Let me read it apart from its context--"Because he brought not
   the offering of the Lord in his appointed season, that man shall bear
   his sin." You see, the great offering of the Lord, the atoning
   Sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the only way by which sin can be
   put away! And if any man will not bring that--in other words, if he
   will not believe in Jesus--then here is his certain doom, "that man
   shall bear his sin." No more terrible judgment can be pronounced upon
   any one of us than this, "that man shall bear his sin." "If you believe
   not that I am He," said Christ, "you shall die in your sins."

   14. And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
   Passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the Passover, and
   adoring to the manner thereof, so shall he do. You shall have one
   ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the
   land. Now comes another subject--

   15. 16. And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, the cloud
   covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony and at even
   there was upon the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire,
   until the morning. So it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and
   the appearance of fire by night. This was the sign of the Presence of
   God in the midst of that vast canvas city! I suppose that the great
   cloud rose up from the most holy place and probably covered the whole
   camp of the tribes, so that it shielded them from the fierceness of the
   sun, while at night the entire region was lit up by this marvelous
   illumination! The chosen nation had the pillar of cloud by day for a
   shelter, and the pillar of fire by night for a light. God's Presence
   acts upon us in much the same way as the cloudy fiery pillar acted upon
   Israel--

   "He has been my joy in woe,

   Cheered my heart when it was low

   And, with warnings softly sad,

   Calmed my heart when it was glad." We get shelter from the fierce heat
   of the world's day and deliverance, also, from the darkness of the
   world's night through our Lord's gracious Presence!

   17-20. And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after
   that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud
   abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. At the
   commandment of the LORD, the children of Israel journeyed, and at the
   commandment of the LORD they pitched. As long as the cloud abode upon
   the tabernacle they rested in their tents. And when the cloud tarried
   long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept
   the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. And so it was, when the
   cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment
   of the LORD, they abode in their tents, and according to the
   commandment of the LORD they journeyed. Happy people to be thus
   Divinely guided! They could never tell when they would have to be on
   the move. They had no abiding city. When their tents were pitched and
   they were just getting comfortably settled, perhaps that very morning
   the pillar of cloud moved and, at other times, when they desired to be
   marching, it stood still. They could never be certain of staying long
   in any one place. It is just so with you and with me--our Lord intends
   to keep us with a loose hold on all things here below. We cannot tell
   what changes may come to any one of us and, therefore, reckon on
   nothing that God has not plainly promised. Be certain of nothing but
   uncertainty and always expect the unexpected! You cannot tell between
   here and Heaven where your Guide may take you--happy will you be if you
   can truly say that you desire to always follow where the Lord leads.

   21-23. And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,
   and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed.
   Whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they
   journeyed. Or whether it were two days or a month, or a year, that the
   cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of
   Israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken up,
   they journeyed. At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the
   tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the
   charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of
   Moses. So may each one of us ever be Divinely guided!--

   "Let the fiery cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey through."

Christ the Cure for Troubled Hearts

   (No. 2408)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, APRIL 14, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   10, 1887.

   "And He said unto them, Why are you troubled and why do doubts arise in
   your hearts." Luke 24:38.

   IT seems, from these questions of our Lord, that true Believers may
   come into a troubled state of mind. The eleven were truly Christ's
   disciples and even His Apostles, yet, when their faith failed them and
   they refused to believe the testimony that Christ was risen from the
   dead, they were troubled in their minds and tossed to and fro, as on a
   stormy sea. Unbelief is a great troubler. Our peace comes to us by
   faith and if our faith grows weak, our peace of mind is apt to decline
   and we are likely to become much disturbed in spirit. If those who are
   Believers, who have passed from death unto life, are sometimes
   troubled, you may be sure that others are! It is no wonder that they
   are troubled who have never experienced the Grace of God in conversion
   and have never felt the joy which Jesus brings to those whom He saves.
   If every unconverted man could see his true state, he would not dare to
   give sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he had been
   brought to know the Lord Jesus Christ. If you who are living without a
   Savior realized your lost condition, your pillows would be stuffed with
   thorns instead of with feathers. I scarcely think that your bread would
   be sweet to your taste, or that light would be pleasant to your eyes,
   if you really knew your present condition and the jeopardy in which
   your souls are found. I tremble for you and I shall be glad if you
   learn to tremble for yourselves--and to flee from the wrath to come!

   I want, at this time, to speak more particularly to some who are, in a
   measure, awakened and awakened to their real position before God, and
   have been so for a long while. They are not happy. They never will be
   happy until a very great change comes over them, yet I do not see why
   they should not, at once, have done with doubts, fears and troubled
   thoughts, and enter immediately into rest and peace. I say that I do
   not see why they should not receive this great blessing, but I see a
   great many reasons why they should! I can truly say that when I preach
   to you, I labor with all my heart and soul to bring you to the Cross of
   Christ. And I have sometimes thought, when I am going home, "That was a
   poor sermon if it is judged merely by the rules of rhetoric, yet it was
   such a sermon that if I could have heard it, myself, when I was in
   despair--when I was longing for salvation--it would have been worth a
   Jew's eye to me, for it would have been the very thing I needed to show
   me the road to Heaven. It would have been a key to unlock my dungeon
   door and to set me at liberty."

   And I am praying that it may be so now--every word I speak is steeped
   in prayer that some of my truly anxious hearers, who would be right if
   they could, may now end their wanderings at the Cross--have done with
   their uneasiness and restlessness--and find peace in Jesus Christ the
   Savior! So, with that objective in view, I am going to take the
   question out of its context and, though Jesus put it to His eleven
   Apostles, I shall venture to address it to you who are very far from
   being Apostles--who are not yet even disciples, but who, at least, wish
   that you were numbered, even, among the least of God's people! To you I
   say, in the words of the text, "Why are you troubled? And why do doubts
   arise in your hearts?"

   I. And, first, THIS QUESTION IS WORTH CONSIDERING--"Why are you
   troubled?"

   Many of you are troubled. Some of you are very greatly troubled, though
   not always to the same extent. You shake off your anxiety, sometimes.
   Unhappy men that you are, that you should be able to shake off a
   trouble which is driving you to the Savior! You get out into company.
   You become immersed in business and you forget this great sorrow, this
   sad perplexity. But, after a while, it comes back to you. A little
   sickness, or a death in the family, or even the east wind and the fogs,
   with the dullness that often accompanies them, will bring back to you
   those sorrowful thoughts and you are again troubled!

   And you have many questions in your heart--you cannot get rid of them.
   It has been so with you for mouths! I know some with whom it has been
   so for years--they have been attending my ministry, perhaps, or the
   ministry of some other preacher of the Word, and, after a sermon which
   has been pressing and personal, they feel dreadfully uneasy. They
   cannot tell what to make of themselves and, sometimes, they have said,
   "This state of things must come to an end. We cannot any longer endure
   to have this indefinable something, this mysterious fear which haunts
   us, and takes away the very joy of life."

   It will be a good thing to ask this question, "Why are we so troubled?"
   because it would be a great pity to be troubled for nothing. If there
   is no cause for the anxiety, let us get rid of it! Count it one of the
   wisest actions to battle with despondency. I do not suppose there is
   any man in this place who is naturally more inclined to despondency
   than I am, but when I feel this pressure upon my spirit, I seek to
   overcome it by hoping in God. I say to myself, "Why are you cast down,
   O my Soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God: for I
   shall yet praise Him who is the health of my countenance, and my God."
   When I press the question home and find that there is nothing, really,
   to disquiet me, I am not disquieted any longer! And I suppose that you
   are of much the same make as I am and, if you look your trouble fairly
   in the face, and you find that there is nothing in it, then you will
   shake yourself loose from it and come to a cheery state of heart once
   more!

   But suppose that there should be something that ought to cause you
   anxiety--is it not best, at once, to make a full investigation of the
   matter? It may be that the cure of the evil lies in the search for it.
   Here is a man who is half afraid that he has contracted a disease, but,
   if so, at present it is only in its early stages. Now, if he is a
   foolish man, he will say, "I shall not trouble about it. If it gets to
   be much worse, then I will see to it." But if he is a wise, intelligent
   man, he says, "I must know the ins and outs of this affair. I will go
   to the best physician I can find and he shall thoroughly examine me,
   and I will know what these symptoms mean, for, even if there is
   disease, perhaps it may be nipped in the bud and my life may yet be
   saved. If I go to the doctor at once, he may be able to battle with
   this mischief before it takes a greater hold upon me." I think that he
   is a very sensible man to say to himself, "Suppose that my health is
   all wrong? Possibly there is a cure for my malady--I will go and see if
   I can have this cure."

   Remember that the first thing you ought to see to is your soul. Sirs,
   by all means, attend to your health! Look well to the title deeds of
   your property, make your wills, and so forth, but, first of all, see to
   the well-being of your immortal nature, for what will you do if you
   should pass into another world and find yourselves forever shut out
   from hope? What an awful thing that would be! Therefore, first and
   foremost, look to that which is to last forever and make your calling
   and election sure! God help you, by His Grace, to see to this matter
   this very hour! If there is a cure to be had anywhere, there will be no
   particular reason for fearing and being troubled if we resolve to go
   and obtain it. If it is, indeed, put within our reach, let us stretch
   out our hand and take it at once--and so end our troubles and questions
   in the best manner possible--by getting the cure for our disease, the
   heal-all for our soul-sickness! The disciples, at the time mentioned in
   our text, were troubled, because, when Jesus stood in their midst, they
   supposed that it was a spirit, a ghost--yet it was no ghost, it was the
   real living Lord Jesus, whom they afterwards handled, who was there,
   but, "they supposed that they had seen a spirit," and therefore, "they
   were terrified and frightened."

   I wonder whether your present troubles arise out of a supposition. I
   have known some who have said to me, "I am afraid, Sir, and this is my
   daily trouble, that God has never chosen me to eternal salvation.
   Suppose that, after all, I should not be one of His elect?" Now,
   listen--suppose that you should be one of His elect? Is there not as
   much sense in supposing the one thing as the other? And suppose that
   you were to leave off supposing--that would be a very sensible thing to
   do! There is not much good that ever comes by indulging suppositions of
   that kind! Neither you nor I can climb to Heaven and unfold that roll.
   "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God." Leave that secret
   thing with Him. I will tell you something in which there is no
   supposition. Our Lord Jesus Christ says, "Him that comes to Me, I will
   in no wise cast out." Under no supposable circumstance will Jesus
   Christ ever cast away a sinner who comes to Him! Therefore, kindly
   leave the supposing alone and just take the certainty that whoever
   comes to Christ, He will in no wise cast out.

   I hear another one say, "But suppose I have committed the unpardonable
   sin?" To which I answer, "But suppose you have not?" And there is just
   as much reason for supposing one way as supposing the other. And again
   I say, suppose you are wise enough to leave off supposing altogether?
   If you have committed the unpardonable sin, I should really like to
   know what it is, for, after reading, I think, as much of sound divinity
   as anybody, I have never yet been able to discover what it is! Nor have
   I ever met with any divine who has even seemed to me to approximate to
   any sure and certain description of what the unpardonable sin may be.
   This much I do know about it--it is called a sin that is unto death.
   And as soon as a man commits it, a spiritual death steals over him, so
   that he never desires mercy, never is conscious of his guilt and never
   wishes to find salvation by Jesus Christ. He becomes dead! So dead that
   it is not merely the sin which is, itself, unpardonable, but the
   condition of heart into which it throws the man, so that he never seeks
   pardon, or even wishes for it. Now, my dear Friends, you know that you
   have not come to that terrible state because you are always restless
   about your soul's salvation and always wishing that by some means you
   might be saved!

   Whatever supposition you bring, I believe that I can sweep your
   supposition away, or that it deserves to be swept away. Therefore, do
   not be in doubt or fear because of a supposition. I could bother you
   with suppositions if I liked to do so. Suppose there were to be an
   earthquake. Suppose that top gallery were to come tumbling down. Why, I
   could go on supposing till I had frightened every nervous soul in the
   place! But what a fool I would be and what fools you would be to be
   frightened thereby! I pray you, believe me, that there is enough in the
   black facts of your case to trouble you without your vexing yourself
   unnecessarily by suppositions! It used to be thought to be a mark of
   sanctity for a man to wear a hair shirt and an iron belt round his
   waist which covered him with sores. We know better than that, now!
   Therefore, why make a hair shirt of suppositions and an iron belt of
   pure inventions of your own imagination? Get rid of them all, I beseech
   you!

   But suppose that you have done with suppositions, yet it may be
   possible that you are troubled with doubts. "Why do doubts arise in
   your hearts?" You are unable to get peace because you have certain
   doubts in your hearts. Well, what are your doubts?

   "I have been thinking," says one, "perhaps the Bible is not true." Now,
   when these disciples thought that Jesus, Himself, was not really there,
   but that it was only a vision, our Savior said to them, "Handle Me, and
   see." And the best way to prove whether the Bible is true is not to
   stand and listen to the evil suggestions of skeptics against it, but to
   hear its own challenge, "Handle Me, and see." There is something
   wonderfully substantial in the religion of Jesus Christ!

   To me, it is life, joy, comfort, strength--everything! I handle it and
   I have tried and proved it for myself, these many years, but I do not
   expect my experience to stand in the place of your own experience of
   it. Go to Christ with prayer, yourself. Go to God with repentance,
   yourself, and see whether He does not pardon you, bless you, change you
   and make a new creature of you! And when He has done that, believe me,
   you will never again doubt whether the Bible is true, for when it shall
   have saved you from your fears, rescued you from your sins and brought
   you into life and light and liberty, you will be absolutely certain
   that it is true because you have tried and tested it yourself!

   "Oh, but I have a different thought from that!" says another friend, "I
   think that I cannot be saved because I do not feel all that I ought to
   feel. I have not had sufficient horror of sin. I have not felt myself
   to be the worst sinner who ever lived. In fact, I do not think I can
   ever drag myself down to that state of despair which I have read of as
   the experience of a great many who have been saved." Now that is
   another of your foolish thoughts which you had better give up thinking!
   Who told you that you must weep a certain quantity of tears? Who told
   you that you must feel a certain degree of anguish? That Book has not
   told you so, nor has God's preacher! But we are continually telling you
   that the suffering on account of sin was laid upon the Lord Jesus
   Christ, that the Atonement for human guilt is in His precious blood and
   that you may come to Him just as you are! Have we not often tried to
   draw a line of distinction between repentance, which is the fruit of
   the Spirit, and despair, which is a temptation of the devil? Many, no
   doubt, come to Christ in black despair, but why should you not come
   with great hopefulness expecting that He will bless you? And if you do
   so come, depend upon it that He will not send you away empty. Get rid
   of that foolish thought, I pray you, and believe in Jesus Christ, my
   Lord. May the Holy Spirit help you to do so!

   Perhaps a third troubled one says, "My thought is, Sir, that, if I
   professed to be a Christian, I should not live up to it." I heard a
   good reply to that remark from one who came to see me last week. One
   said to her, "You know, if you make a profession of religion, you must
   live up to it." "Oh," she answered, "all the profession I make is that
   I put my trust in the Lord Jesus Christ--and I put my trust in Him to
   help me to live up to it--I dare trust Him as far as that." Mind that
   you do the same and get rid, altogether, of the thought that it is you,
   by yourself, who has to live up to your profession.

   Salvation is of the Lord, alone! You have to accept Grace from Christ
   for nothing and He will delight to give it to you. And He will also
   delight to continue to give you all the Grace you need till He brings
   you safely home to Glory!

   Our Lord asked His disciples, "Why are you troubled and why do doubts
   arise in your hearts?" There are some who say, "It is the feelings that
   we have in our heart that causes us anxiety." Well now, what are your
   feelings? As a rule, I care much more about faith than about feelings,
   but for once, tell me what your feelings are, you who are troubled and
   vexed with anxious thoughts.

   "Well, Sir," says one, "I am afraid that I shall not be saved." But why
   not? "Oh, I do not know why, but I am afraid I will not!" Well, do you
   not think that you are very foolish? If you will think of it a little,
   you will be sure that you are. Because, when a person says, "I am so
   fearful," and you ask, "What are you afraid of?" and he says, " Oh, I
   do not know, but I am so fearful!" you would say to him, "My dear
   fellow, if you do not know what it is that you fear, then give up being
   fearful!" If you have nothing to be afraid of, do not be afraid, for
   what can be the reason of it?

   "Oh, but, Sir," says another, "I feel--well, to make short work of it,
   I feel that it is too good to be true." What is too good to be true?
   "Why, that I may have my sins forgiven simply upon my believing and may
   now, at once, become a child of God!" Too good to be true, is it? Well,
   it would be too good to be true if it came from you--but as it comes
   from God, nothing is too good to be true of the good and gracious God!
   He is willing to blot out all your sins if you will but trust to the
   Lord Jesus Christ. However much you may have transgressed against His
   Laws, He is prepared to pass an act of amnesty and oblivion and to blot
   out all your transgressions! Your wanderings, your blasphemies, even,
   He is ready to forgive--more ready to forgive than you are to be
   forgiven--and He puts it simply thus, "Believe in My Son. Trust that He
   whom I have appointed to save you will save you and, upon your so
   trusting, your transgressions are forgiven and you are saved."

   It is a great message that we have to deliver. Would you have a little
   Gospel from a great God? Would you have a little Gospel from that great
   Savior who was the Son of God and yet died upon the Cross? If it had
   been less than it is, you would have begun to quibble about its
   littleness! But now that it is so great, I pray you, do not quarrel
   with great mercy, but receive it, believe it, believe it at once and
   let your doubts and fears end from this time forth, through the
   effectual working of God's gracious Spirit!

   I have lingered too long over this first division, yet I hope I have
   convinced you that the question is worth considering.

   II. The question we have now to consider is this--HAS YOUR TROUBLE
   ANYTHING TO DO WITH JESUS?

   This is what our Lord meant by enquiring of His disciples, "Why are you
   troubled and why do doubts arise in your hearts?" Their trouble had to
   do with Jesus, but they had made a great mistake concerning Him.

   "Well," you say, "this subject of Jesus and His salvation, it is all a
   supernatural business." Do all supernatural matters frighten you? "Yes,
   Sir, they do. I am afraid of that which goes beyond the verge of things
   that can be seen." You will be there, yourself, before long--whether
   you are afraid of it or not, you will die. As surely as you are in this
   Tabernacle, you will have to do with that which is supernatural! You
   may live a considerable time, perhaps, if you are a young man, but it
   will seem a very short while when you come to the end of it. And then
   death, Heaven, Hell, angels, God, the Judgement Seat and eternity will
   have to be dealt with by you! Oh, it would be a great mercy if you
   could now get to be familiar with these things! Think where you wish to
   live forever--you had better learn the language of the country! It
   would be well for you to begin to understand something of the world to
   come, for come it will, and there is no putting it off. The strongest
   man in this place will have to die and it is a reflection which often
   forces itself upon me that poor, weak, sickly people keep on living
   when you thought that they would have been dead years ago--but your
   fine, strong, healthy men--these are they of whom we hear, "Such an one
   died at the railway station." Or, "Such an one was taken all of a
   sudden, and is gone." Therefore, see to this matter, Sir! See to it at
   once! You will have to deal with the supernatural sooner or later, so
   had you not better begin now?

   "Oh," you say, "but this Lord Jesus Christ, in whom you tell me to
   trust, seems so unreal. I cannot see Him and handle Him, as those
   Apostles did. He is so unreal to me." Yes, so the Apostles thought, you
   know. They thought that they saw a ghost--yet there is nothing more
   real in all the world than our Lord Jesus Christ! I wish that you would
   seek Him tonight. I wish that you would get to that little room of
   yours and kneel at your bedside, and cry, "Savior, if You are, indeed,
   a Savior, here is a sinner who longs to be saved! Come and save me." If
   you do so, you shall soon find that though not gripped with the hands,
   or seen with the eyes, yet there is no brighter, truer, or more living
   reality than Jesus Christ, the Son of God!

   "But, Sir," you cry, "this believing seems so vague and indistinct. If
   you told me something that I had to do, I would try to do it. If I had
   to go barefoot from here to John O'Groat's House, for instance, I would
   know what that meant and I would start tomorrow morning, or, if
   necessary tonight." Yes, I daresay you would, but, after all, there is
   nothing more vague in your being told to believe in Jesus than there
   would be in bidding you to walk barefoot to John O'Groat's House. To
   believe in Jesus is a most simple matter, easily understood, even by a
   child--it is just to trust Him, that is all. To believe that what is
   written concerning Him is true and then to trust yourself entirely to
   Him--that will save you. Look, I have thrown my whole weight upon this
   platform rail. If that should go down, I shall go down. Do just that
   with the Lord Jesus--throw your whole weight on Him. If He cannot save
   you, be lost. I must be lost, I am sure, if He cannot save me. My whole
   and only hope hangs on those dear hands that were nailed to the Cross.
   My only trust is in that precious blood which flowed from His pierced
   side. I risk my eternal destiny with Him and feel that there is no risk
   whatever in doing so! Now, tell me, is that vague? It seems to me to be
   very distinct and clear.

   "Well," says one, "but, somehow, Christ seems so unapproachable. I
   cannot get at Him." Now, that is the last thing that you ought to say,
   for He will receive you if you breathe only a silent prayer to Him. In
   the pew down there, sitting on your seat, or standing in the aisle, or
   away up in the gallery, just speak to Him in your heart and He will
   hear you in a moment. Unapproachable? Why, beloved Friends, there is
   nobody so approachable as Christ! A wish will reach Him, a tear has
   already found Him--He is everywhere present wherever there is any heart
   that longs to obtain salvation through Him!

   Then I fancy that I hear one of you say, "Ifeel that He is so holy that
   I, so guilty, cannot come to Him." Would you have Him to be unholy,
   then? If He were so, how could He save you? But, being holy, yet He
   bids you come to Him. Then why do you not come? Why do you make a
   barrier out of such a glorious fact as this, that Christ is good, just
   and true? Remember that this, also, is true, that Jesus Christ came
   into the world to save sinners. If He does not save sinners, then He
   came into this world to mock us! He came into this world for nothing
   and if you, being a sinner, will come to Christ and Christ rejects you,
   He has forgotten His commission, He has belied His Character! He must
   give up His name, for He is no longer Jesus if He does not save sinners
   that come to Him, yes, and if He does not save sinners that do not come
   to Him, too, for He has come to seek and to save--both to seek and to
   save--that which was lost.

   "But," says yet another, "I cannot think that the Lord Jesus Christ
   would take any notice of me." Oh, that I could nail your wretched,
   miserable thoughts of my great Lord up on His Cross! "Oh, but I am
   nobody, Sir!" Christ died for nobodies! "But I am poor." "The poor have
   the Gospel preached to them." "But I am quite illiterate." Yes, and it
   is to such that a plain Gospel is sent by our gracious Savior. "But I
   am altogether obscure and unknown." Oh, no, you are not! The Lord Jesus
   knows all about you! Even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do
   not suppose that if you were rich, Christ would think any more of you
   than He does now! You know how it is among men--if a man wears a good
   coat and a diamond ring, people give him a seat as soon as he comes
   into the aisle!

   Yes, but that is not the spirit of Jesus Christ! He does not care about
   your diamond rings and your satin dresses. My Lord Himself wore a smock
   frock, woven from the top, throughout, a garment without seam. He was
   dressed as the most plain and humble of peasants dressed, and He
   delighted to associate with the poorest of the poor. Therefore, do not
   tell me that He will not condescend to look at you! My Lord would leave
   off listening to the songs of angels to hear a poor sinner cry! If it
   were some grand review day in Heaven, when cherubim and mailed seraphim
   marched before His august eye, He would leave the camp of angels to
   come and listen to a beggar's prayer, for, remember, He is a Man as
   truly as He is God, and everything that is human touches that true
   heart of His that was pierced for men. Therefore, cry to Him, ask Him
   to have mercy upon you and He will stand still, as He did when blind
   Bartimaeus cried to Him! And He will command you to be brought before
   Him--and then He will say to you, "What will you that I should do for
   you?" And He will give you spiritual sight and spiritual health in
   answer to your prayer. Come to Him, however poor, weak and
   insignificant you may be, and you shall soon prove that it is even as I
   say.

   If you have made any mistakes about my Lord and Master, I hope that
   what I have said may help to remove them.

   III. Now, lastly, and may God bless this word to you, dear troubled
   Friend, to bring you to the Savior! JESUS RIGHTLY KNOWN WILL MEET EVERY
   TROUBLE OF EVERY SEEKING SOUL.

   If you did but know Him, you would find an end to your trouble at once!
   Those lines are quite true--

   "His worth, if all the nations knew, Surely the whole world would love
   Him too." If men did but know what a Savior He is, they would never
   rest till they had proved Him to be their Savior! Let me tell you a few
   things that may help to end all your troubles. First, Jesus Christ is
   alive. He died, but He rose again. He is alive and living among men.
   Spiritually, He is still on earth. His bodily Presence is in Heaven,
   but His spiritual Presence is everywhere--

   "Wherever we seek Him, He is found."

   He is alive, active, living, present with us here, giving us His
   benedictions, working out His Divine projects--a living present force
   among the myriads of this city--a living present Person in this House
   of Prayer.

   Next, Jesus Christ lives as One who has made a full Atonement for sin.
   Do you know what that means? This is what I understand by Atonement. We
   were guilty. We had sinned and the Law of God has bound punishment to
   sin with iron clamps. I am sure that the only way in which the world is
   to be governed is by this Law of God, that the consequences of evil
   must be evil. If men will do wrong, they must be punished. With all
   reverence, we may say that God Himself cannot reverse that Law, for it
   is a right and proper Law. Well, then, Jesus Christ came and bore the
   consequences of human sin in His own body on the tree and those who
   believe in Jesus Christ, by the very act of believing, accept Him to be
   their Substitute, bearing their guilt and punishment, and being unto
   God a Sacrifice instead of them. Therefore, as many as have believed in
   Jesus Christ may know for sure that He died in their place.

   I remember talking, one day, to a poor man, an Irishman, and trying to
   make this point very plain to him. I said, "Now suppose you had
   committed a murder and you were to be hanged for it." "Yes," he
   replied, "and I should deserve it." "But suppose I should go to the
   Queen and say to her, 'I am willing to be hanged, instead of this man.
   Such is my love for him that, to set him free and yet to honor the law,
   I will consent to die in his place"? The man said, "That would be very
   kind of you, Sir." "Well, suppose that the Queen had the ability to
   consent to it and I could be accepted as your substitute--and I were
   hanged instead of you--would the policeman take you up for that
   murder?" "Oh, no!" he exclaimed, "I would say, 'You can't touch me.
   Why, the gentleman was hanged instead of me! Therefore, I am free."

   That is exactly the way of salvation. Jesus Christ suffered in the
   place of all of you who trust in Him and you are clear before the bar
   of Divine Justice. Every man who believes in Jesus Christ, that is,
   trusts Him, may know without doubt that Christ was, for him, a certain
   and effectual Substitute by which his sin was put away on the Cross.
   "Who His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." Now, if
   you understand that great Truth of God, I think that your doubts and
   fears ought to come to an end at once.

   Remember, also, that Jesus Christ lives to give repentance and
   remission of sins. In this very chapter we read that He bade His
   Apostles go and preach repentance and remission of sins in His name
   among all nations! He says to you, "Turn from your sin and I will turn
   from My anger. Quit your sin and your sin is forgiven. Leave it. Loathe
   it and I will grant you immediate pardon for the sake of the great
   atoning Sacrifice." This Truth, also, if it is fully believed, should
   bring peace and joy to your heart and mind!

   Please remember, also, that the Lord Jesus Christ lives to pray for
   sinners. He lives to make intercession for the transgressors! He lives
   to give to sinners the Holy Spirit to work in them true belief and true
   repentance! He lives mighty to save, to do for you what you cannot do
   for yourself, to bear you up and bear you through, and bring you, at
   last, to His own right hand!

   Brothers and Sisters, as I trust my Lord Jesus Christ, myself, with all
   my heart, with all my future, my past, my present, with, indeed,
   everything, and as I feel perfect peace in doing so, I would to God
   that you would do the same, that you might feel the same peace, and get
   strength within to bear the troubles of this mortal life. Did you ever
   hear what good John Hyatt, who used to preach to the sailors, said when
   he was dying? Someone asked him, "Mr. Hyatt, can you trust Jesus with
   your soul, now?" "Trust Jesus with my soul!" he exclaimed, "if I had
   ten thousand souls, I could trust them all with Him!" We are not ten
   thousand here, tonight--we are somewhat under that number--but oh, that
   we might all come and trust our souls with Jesus! Then, in that Last
   Great Day, with sweet clamor of praise, with united tempests of song,
   we will bless that dear crucified but now exalted Savior who will not
   fail one of us, but will bring us to see His face in Glory!

   Will you not trust Him tonight? Dear Friend, you might go down those
   stairs, you know, with a firm foot, saying, "I am a saved man." Yes,
   out of this area many a troubled heart may make its way and go home
   with all the bells ringing out sweet hallelujahs--"I have believed! I
   am forgiven! I am the chief of sinners, but I am forgiven, for I have
   trusted where God bids me trust. And now, because I am forgiven and am
   a child of God, I will live a new life, and I will serve the Lord with
   all my heart."

   You good soldiers who are here, tonight, I hope you are already good
   soldiers of Jesus Christ. But if you are not, I would like to be the
   recruiting sergeant and enlist you beneath the standard of the Cross.
   Only trust my Lord and you shall be saved in the day of battle, and
   saved in the hour of death--yes, and saved amidst the temptations of
   this wicked city. He shall cover you! He, Himself, shall cover you and
   you shall be perfectly safe beneath that Divine Shelter! Who will trust
   Christ and be saved? Lord, give us many souls, tonight, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MARK16:1-14; LUKE24:32-44.

   Mark 16:1, 2. And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary,
   the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they
   might come and anoint Him. And very early in the morning, the first day
   of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun.
   Their love made them prompt. Their affection was about to attempt a
   needless and, indeed, impossible thing. Yet I do not doubt that it was
   acceptable before God. Oh, that we had such love that even the dead
   body of the Christ should be so dear to us that we would be ready, at
   great expense, to anoint it! I fear that, nowadays, even His living
   Word is not valued as it should be. How few, therefore, should we be
   likely to find who would have cared for His dead body? These holy women
   had had cause enough to love their Lord and they showed that their
   hearts were full of affection for Him even after He had been taken from
   them.

   3. And they said among themselves, Who shall roll away the stone from
   the door of the sepulcher? A question that has puzzled many other
   people concerning many other things perplexed these holy women, yet
   there was no reason for the question to be raised at all. Perhaps some
   of you are, at this time, distressed when there is no cause for
   distress, and in fear where no fear is. It was so with these women who
   said, one to another, "Who shall roll away the stone from the door of
   the sepulcher?"

   4. And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for
   it was very great. And, therefore, hard to roll away and, therefore,
   the more easily seen when it was rolled away! And, therefore, the
   greater cause for joy that it was rolled away! In the greatness of our
   troubles there may often be space for the greater display of the
   goodness of God! A great trial may be nothing more than the prelude of
   a great joy. Do not dread the foaming billows, for they may wash you
   ashore--it is the worst that they can do--and it is also the best. The
   stone at the door of the sepulcher was very great, but it was rolled
   away, so that it mattered not to the women how great it was.

   5. And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the
   right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were frightened.
   An angel had been allowed to assume the appearance of a man--that
   usually seems to be the way in which angels appear to men. I suppose
   there is, after all, a great kinship between angels and men, otherwise
   angelic beings would not so constantly assume that form when they
   appear to men. At the sight of the young man clothed in a long white
   garment, these good women were frightened.

   6. 7. And he said to them, Be not frightened: You seek Jesus of
   Nazareth, who was crucified: He is risen; He is not here: behold the
   place where they laid Him. But go your way, tell His disciples and
   Peter that He goes before you into Galilee: there shall you see Him, as
   He said unto you. Make sure, Beloved, that you know the Truth of God
   for yourselves and then hasten to tell it to others. I pray you, run
   not without knowing what your errand is to be, but I also pray you,
   when you have an errand for the Lord, do not tarry, but, "Go your way,
   tell His disciples." It was very thoughtful of this angel to say, "and
   Peter," thus linking with the disciples the name of him who had most
   glaringly transgressed and denied his Master,

   8. And they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher; for they
   trembled and were amazed: neither said they anything to any man, for
   they were afraid. But, after this, they summoned up courage and did
   tell the story of their Lord's resurrection.

   9-13. Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, He
   appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.
   And she went and told them that had been with Him, as they mourned and
   wept. And they, when they had heard that He was alive, and had been
   seen of her, believed not. After that He appeared in another form unto
   two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. And they went
   and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them. Unbelief is very
   hard to kill, even in hearts that are right with God. So we need not
   wonder that Divine Grace is required to expel unbelief from the hearts
   of the unregenerate!

   14. Afterward He appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat, and
   upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
   believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen. The story of
   our Lord's appearance to the disciples is more fully told by Luke in
   the 24th Chapter of his Gospel, to which let us turn.

   Luke 24:32-35. And they said, one to another, Did not our heart burn
   within us, while He talked with as by the way, and while He opened to
   us the Scriptures? And they rose up the same hour and returned to
   Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together and them that were
   with them, saying, The Lord is risen, indeed, and has appeared to
   Simon. And they told what things were done in the way, and how He was
   known of them in breaking of bread. These were the two disciples who
   had recognized their Lord in the breaking of bread, though they did not
   know Him during their walk with Him to Emmaus.

   36. And as they thus spoke, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them,
   and said unto them, Peace be unto you. This was the common Jewish
   salutation, but, from then on it would be sanctified most Divinely and
   it would be a Christian greeting to say, "Peace be unto you."

   37-44. But they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they
   had seen a spirit. And He said unto them, Why are you troubled? And why
   do doubts arise in your hearts? Behold My hands and My feet, that it is
   I, Myself; handle Me and see; far a spirit has not flesh and bones, as
   you see I have. And when He had thus spoken, He showed them His hands
   and His feet. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He
   said unto them, Have you here any meat? And they gave Him a piece of a
   broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And He took it, and did eat before
   them. And He said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you
   while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were
   written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms
   concerning Me. Notice the seals which our Lord continually set upon the
   Old Testament, the manner in which He always treated the Scripture, the
   reverent way in which He confessed its Infallibility--and His
   determination that in every item, every jot and tittle--it should be
   fulfilled by Himself. This was often manifested before His death and,
   on His return from the grave, He had not changed His mind! He here
   speaks of the three great parts into which the Old Testament was
   divided by the Jews and He expressly sets the seal of His royal assent
   upon "the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms." May we, in like
   manner, prize the whole Inspired Word!

A Great Sermon by the Greatest Preacher

   (No. 2409)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, APRIL 21, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING APRIL
   17, 1887.

   "And lo, a voice came from Heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in
   whom I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17.

   A CERTAIN divine, who had taken this verse as his text, spoke upon it
   under these three heads. "First," he said, "here is a great pulpit--the
   voice was from Heaven. Secondly, here is a great Preacher--it was the
   Father who spoke as only God can speak. And, thirdly, here is a great
   sermon--'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'"

   I do not think that I could arrange my thoughts better than under these
   three divisions, that is to say, if I intended to preach at any length
   from the whole passage that I have taken as my text. It is from Heaven
   that this voice comes. It is the voice of the Father, Himself, that
   speaks. And what the voice says is worthy to be treasured in the hearts
   of us all. "This--this Man who has just come up dripping from the River
   Jordan, upon whom the Spirit, like a dove, descended and rested--this
   is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

   But, on this occasion I am going to say, first, that the Father was
   well pleased with Christ. Secondly, I want to ask the question, are we
   well pleased with Him? And then to answer, on behalf of many of you,
   "Yes, that we are! For we also can say of the Lord Jesus that with Him
   we are, indeed, well pleased."

   I. The first division is in the text itself--THE FATHER WAS WELL
   PLEASED WITH HIS BELOVED SON.

   I find that the translation would be even more accurate if the passage
   read, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I was well pleased." Let us
   begin, then, with that thought--the Father had been well pleased with
   His Son. The past, rather than the present, though not to the exclusion
   of the present, seems to be intended in the Greek word here used--"This
   is My beloved Son, in whom I was well pleased." That is to say, "Before
   He was born here among men, before His first infant cry was heard at
   Bethlehem, before He was obedient to His parents at Nazareth, before He
   toiled in the carpenter's shop, before He had reached the prime of His
   Manhood and was able to come forth and to be dedicated to His sacred
   ministry in the waters of Baptism--before that--I was well pleased with
   Him."

   Yes, and we must go further back than that, for He "was" before He was
   here! "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
   the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things
   were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made."
   In those far-distant ages when the worlds were made, when matter and
   mind were spoken into existence by the creative Word of God, the Father
   took counsel with His beloved and equal Son--Jesus Christ as well as
   the Father was Infinite Wisdom--He balanced the clouds, weighed the
   hills, appointed the throbs of the tide and kindled the light of the
   sun! He was the Father's Well-Beloved before the earth was! Yes, and in
   those primeval days, when as yet there was nothing but God--if your
   imagination can get back to the time when our great sun and the moon
   and stars slept in the mind of God like unborn forests in an acorn
   cup--in that eternity when there was no time, no day, no space, nor
   anything but God, the All-in-All, you will realize that even then the
   Only-Begotten was with the Father and in Him the Father was well
   pleased, for as God is eternal in His being, He is eternal in the
   trinity of His Person! The Triune Jehovah is the theme of praise both
   on earth and in Heaven! As we have often sung--

   "Holy, Holy, Holy Thee, One Jeho vah e vermore, Father, Son, and
   Spirit! We, Dust and ashes, would adore! Lightly by the world esteemed,

   From that world by You redeemed, Sing we here, with glad accord, Holy,
   Holy, Holy Lord! Holy, Holy, Holy! All Hea ven's triumphant choir shall
   sing When the ransomed nations fall At the footstool of their King!
   Then shall saints and seraphim, Harps and voices, swell one hymn, Round
   the throne with full accord, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord."

   We cannot fully comprehend the great doctrine of the Divine Filiation
   and the less we pry into it, the better. But certain it is that the
   Sonship of Christ does not imply any second position in order of time.
   As the Father was always the Father, so the Son was always the Son.
   Before all worlds and time, itself, He was with the Father, co-equal
   and co-eternal with Him. Now, dear Friends, a love which has endured
   forever--which, even now, is eternal--since it had no beginning and can
   have no end, this is a mighty love, indeed! And it helps to make us
   wonder all the more that God should so love the world as to give His
   only-begotten Son, freighted with such love as this, to come down here
   and live, and die, that He might save a guilty race that had only just
   begun--an infant race of a few thousand years. It will forever be a
   marvel that the Father would have been willing to sacrifice the Eternal
   and Ever-Blessed for the sake of such worthless creatures as these! Let
   your minds and hearts adoringly dwell, then, on that first view of the
   text, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I was well pleased."

   Now read it, "The Father is well pleased with the Lord Jesus Christ
   always." The, "I am," of our version, containing, as it does, within
   itself the, "I was," of the original, implies perpetuity and
   continuity. God the Father is always pleased with His beloved Son.
   There was never a time when He was otherwise than pleased with Him!
   Yes, He was pleased with Him even in Gethsemane, when His sweat was, as
   it were, great drops of blood falling to the ground. He was pleased
   with Him when He gave Him up to be nailed to the Cross of Calvary, for,
   though it pleased the Father to prove Him, and He did, for a while,
   hide His face from Him because of the necessary purposes of His atoning
   Sacrifice, yet He always loved Him. I think that our Lord was never
   fairer to the eyes of His Father than when He was all ruddy with His
   bloody sweat. And that He never seemed lovelier to Him than when His
   obedient hands were given to the nails and His willing feet were
   fastened to the tree. Then must He have seemed to be God's rose and
   lily, first spotless, then all bloodied--the gathering up of all the
   loveliness of which only the Infinite mind of God could conceive. The
   Well-Beloved was always dear to the Father--the Father was always well
   pleased with Him--and He is well pleased with Him now!

   How little there is, even, about those of us who are the Lord's
   children which can please our heavenly Father, but God is always well
   pleased with Christ. We get to wandering away from Him. Our garments
   become defiled by sin. Sometimes the Lord has need to chide us and to
   chastise us, but as for His beloved Son, He is always well pleased with
   Him! And, blessed be His name, He is well pleased with us in Him! Oh,
   that we could always remember this glorious Truth of God! Still,
   whatever we may be, the finger of the great Father always points to His
   dear Son in Glory, and He says, "This, this is My beloved Son, in whom,
   notwithstanding all that His people do, I am always well pleased."

   Let me read the text again a little differently and say that God is
   perfectly pleased with Christ. He could not be more pleased with Him
   than He is and there could not be anything in Christ that would be more
   pleasing to the Father than what there already is in Christ. I believe
   that the Father is perfectly well pleased with Christ as God, with
   Christ as Man, with Christ in the manger, with Christ preaching the
   Word throughout Judea, with Christ working miracles, with Christ in
   Pilate's Hall, with Christ upon the Cross, with Christ in the grave,
   with Christ risen again, with Christ at His right hand and with Christ
   soon to come in the glory of His Second Advent. The Father is always
   perfectly pleased with His beloved Son. What the great Father's mind
   is, none of us can know, for the finite cannot measure the Infinite. We
   have no standard that can apply to Him, but we are sure that it must
   need an Infinite Objective of delight to satisfy the Infinite mind of
   the Father--and Christ fully satisfies it.

   Sometimes, when I have been very earnestly pleading with the Father in
   prayer, I have felt as if I could cry, "Hear me, O God, hear me, O my
   Father, hear me for Your dear Son's sake!" And then I have changed my
   plea and said, "Look at Him! Are you not well pleased with Him? Was
   there ever such beauty as You see in Him? Was there ever such obedience
   as He rendered to You? Was there ever such truth, such holiness, such
   absolute perfection as you see in Him?" And I have felt that then I had
   a good plea with God, for He is infinitely satisfied with His dear Son!
   There is nothing to satisfy God in all the worlds He has made--He could
   make as many more, in a moment, if He pleased. There is nothing to
   satisfy Him in anything that is merely spoken into existence. But with
   His other Self, His Only-Begotten, in every condition and in every
   case, from every point of view, He is well pleased and perfectly
   satisfied--and well He may be, for Christ is worthy of His Father's
   satisfaction and delight.

   Then further, to change our note, yet still to play much the same tune,
   the Father is overflowinglypleased with Christ. Can you catch my
   thought? The Father is not only pleased with Christ so much as to love
   Christ and to dwell in Christ, Himself, but He takes us up and He
   delights in us when we are in Christ because He has more delight in
   Christ then even Christ, Himself, can hold--and He wants more empty
   vessels into which to pour the rich wine of His soul's delight. He
   loves Jesus so much that He can afford to love poor wretched sinners
   such as we are for Christ's sake! He does, as it were, say to Himself,
   "I have filled the ocean bed of my dear Son's Nature with my Divine
   Love. Now bring here all the dried-up torrent-beds that you can find
   and I will fill them, also. Yes, bring here the dry Saharas, the wild
   deserts where never a drop of dew has fallen, and I will make them all
   to rejoice and blossom as the rose with this superfluity of love which
   I have to My dear Son! There is enough to make Me love, even the world,
   for His dear sake." Our Lord Jesus has so won the Infinite heart of the
   Most High that the Divine Love overflows to us!

   Beloved, let us come and get under the drippings of this love! Here is
   Christ's cup running over--let us draw near and drink from the overflow
   of the love of God to Jesus Christ. You men, you women, you have
   committed so much sin that God cannot love you in yourselves--you have
   so offended His infinite justice that His pure and holy Nature repents
   that He ever made you! But look, look, I see another Man come in, a Man
   like ourselves, in every respect a true Man, but such a Man that when
   the great Father sees Him, He says to Him, "My Son, My Son, I am so
   delighted with You, the one perfect Man, that for Your sake I am glad
   that I made men. I am delighted that I made them in Your image. You
   shall be the Firstborn among many Brothers and Sisters. For Your sake I
   will not destroy men from off the face of the earth. For Your sake, for
   the sake of that one Man, My Fellow and yet Man, I will bless the
   untold multitudes whom I have chosen before the foundation of the
   world, and whom I give to You to be the reward of Your soul's travail,
   who shall be accepted in Your righteousness, loved because of My love
   to You and saved in Your salvation."

   Sirs, if you had Paul or Apollos here to speak on such a theme as this,
   even they might fail to deal with it as it deserves! Only God the Holy
   Spirit can make us get even the shadow of an idea of how much God loves
   His Son and how ready He is to love us, also, and how truly He does
   love us who are in Him!

   That God should pity me, I can understand, but that, for the sake of
   His dear Son, He should actually take a complaisant delight in me and
   love me, this is, indeed, wonderful! And His Son has so loved me that
   He has espoused me to Himself. Before the earth was, He chose me for
   His love--and now He loves me for His choice. Let this thought ravish
   your hearts--it is enough to do so! Before the daystar shot forth its
   first beams of light, the heart of Jesus Christ was set on you and He
   loves you, now, as much as He loved you, then, and He will always love
   you! When all the things that are shall have gone back into their
   natural non-existence, He will still love you with all the power of His
   Infinite mind! No, He is not only espoused to you and bound to love
   you, but He has taken you into a marriage union of the most mysterious
   kind--and He will never be content till He shall eat the marriage feast
   with you and you shall sit down with Him and the chorales of the
   universe, every sigh and sorrow hushed to rest, and every joy let loose
   from the secret treasury of bliss! As the Lord Jesus lives in Glory
   with His Father, so will He have you to be with Him at His right hand,
   to sit upon His Throne, even as He has overcome and has sat down with
   the Father upon His Throne!

   1 have also to say yet something more. The Father is well pleased with
   His Son actively. That is to say, His pleasure in His Son shows
   itself--He does something to honor His Son. When we pray, "Father,
   glorify Your Son," that prayer is only a faint echo of God's resolve
   and determination that He will glorify His Son. Can you picture that
   wondrous scene when He shall come in His Glory and all the holy angels
   with Him--He that once was spat upon, crucified, dead and buried--can
   you imagine the splendors of that august moment when Heaven shall empty
   out its legions of angels to accompany the returning Prince of the
   kings of the earth? Then shall sun and moon be ashamed and hide their
   diminished light, for the Lamb, Himself, shall shine with a brightness
   before which they shall be black as sackcloth of hair!

   Then, with the ten thousand times ten thousand of His Father's
   courtiers who will come streaming out of Heaven's golden gates, He will
   sit upon the Throne of His Glory. I was going to try to picture the
   scene, but I could not possibly do it. I will only say, "Thus shall it
   be done unto the Man whom the King delights to honor," while ten
   thousand, thousand trumpets blow to raise the sleeping dead--and quick
   and dead from sea and land stand before His dread tribunal and every
   eye shall see Him--and they that hated Him shall call upon the rocks to
   fall upon them, and hide them from His face! In that day shall it be
   seen how God has resolved to prove His good pleasure in His Son by
   giving Him glory, honor, majesty, dominion, power and might forever and
   ever. Yes, dear Friends, God loves to glorify His Son! Here I must
   leave this part of my subject, for I want to come to a practical point
   in the latter portions of my discourse.

   II. We have seen that the Father is well pleased with Christ. Now let
   me ask, in the second place, ARE WE ALSO WELL PLEASED WITH THE LORD
   JESUS CHRIST? Can we look at Him and say, "This is my beloved Savior,
   in whom I am well pleased"?

   If so, listen to this. Here is the point where God and our souls can
   meet. God loves Jesus--so do we. The Lord delights to glorify Jesus--so
   do we. He will make all things subservient to the honor of Christ--so
   would we. God's love is like the sun and we reflect its light just as
   little drops of dew that hang upon the blades of grass reflect it, but,
   as the dewdrop is agreed with the sun, so are we agreed with God. I
   like to feel that, notwithstanding all my imperfections and sin, I can
   meet God in Christ! Can you meet Him there, dear Friends? I know that
   many of you can--what a blessed meeting place it is! Across that marred
   body of the spotless and lovely Jesus, God and man embrace one another!
   I am a sinner and the Father takes the sinner's hand, and says, "I have
   forgiven you for My dear Son's sake." And we stand there and say,
   "Heavenly Father, we bless You for Jesus. "And He says, "I gave Him to
   bless you, I intended Him to bless you, and now I delight that you
   should bless Him and should praise His name." You know that if you take
   us upon any other ground, there is a point of difference--God and man
   cannot agree until they come to the God-Man, Christ Jesus--and then,
   where God and man have met in one Person, and are joined together in an
   everlasting union, there God meets men and they are bound together in
   an alliance that shall never be broken! What a blessed thought this is!
   Our love to Christ enables us to find a meeting place with God in the
   Person of His dear Son.

   Well, next, can we say that we are well pleased with Christ? Then, as
   the Father says He is well pleased with Christ, here is a place for
   cooperation as well as for union. Now we can be laborers together with
   God, for this is a work in which we delight, and it is a work in which
   God also delights. See, Brothers and Sisters, you can go and try to
   show how much you love the Savior. And when you do that, God is also
   showing how He loves the Savior. If this is the work in which you
   engage, you are sure to have God with you. Suppose you were to adopt
   some highly ambitious projects--for instance, the formation of a
   religious sect, the building up of a confraternity of which you would
   be the head, with the objective of honoring and glorifying
   yourself--well, you would have to look a long while before you would
   have God with you! But if the one aim of your life is to glorify
   Christ, you know that God the Father is with you, for it is His
   ever-present desire to glorify Christ!

   If your ministry is full of Christ, it is a ministry that God can
   bless. "Oh," said a Brother to me, only today, speaking of a certain
   minister, "I could not hear him, for there is nothing of Christ in his
   sermons." Where there is nothing of Christ, Brothers and Sisters, there
   is nothing of unction, nothing of savor--and a man is quite right not
   to attend such a ministry as that. Leave Christ out of your preaching
   and you have taken the milk from the children! You have taken the
   strong meat from the men. But if your objective as a teacher or
   preacher is to glorify Christ and to lead men to love Him and trust
   Him, why, that is the very work upon which the heart of God, Himself,
   is set! The Lord and you are pulling together--and God the Holy Spirit
   can set His seal to a work like that! Is it not a marvelous thing that
   we should be workers together with God?

   When He made the skies, we could not help Him. When He lit up the
   stars, we could not help Him. When He rules nations, we cannot help
   Him. But when He comes to glorify His Son, then we can be workers
   together with Him! It is by means of men, by the use of instruments,
   that Christ is to be glorified! And, therefore, here is a sphere for us
   in which our weakness stands side by side with Omnipotence! Our folly
   is taught of Divine Wisdom and made to co-operate with Omniscience! I
   bless the Lord that He said of Jesus, "This is My beloved Son, in whom
   I am well pleased," for as we, also, are well pleased with Him, here is
   a blessed point of co-operation!

   Once more, if we can say, "Yes, we are well pleased with Christ," then
   we have before us a fountain of pleasure. Are you pleased with Christ?
   Then you may always be pleased! Are you well pleased with Christ? Then
   you shall never lose the source and spring of your pleasure! Not long
   ago you were well pleased with a dear wife, but she is gone, yet the
   Lord lives. It is but a little while ago that you were well pleased
   with a sweet child. The lamb has been caught away to the heavenly fold,
   but the Good Shepherd is with you always--you can still be well pleased
   with Him! A few years ago we were pleased with our physical strength
   and with our youthful vigor. It is all gone, now, but Jesus is not
   gone--we can still be well pleased with Him! By-and-by, we may come
   into such stress of circumstances that all that pleased us shall be a
   dissolving view. Our wealth will leave us, or we shall leave it. All
   that lies below must be renounced, for a film is coming over the eyes
   and the breath is drawn with pain, and the spirit is about to depart to
   God who gave it.

   Ah, then, Beloved, it will be a blessed thing to be well pleased with
   Jesus, for He will be with us in death, and with us throughout
   eternity! If you are well pleased with Christ, you have a fountain
   which neither frost can freeze nor heat can dry. We may be too well
   pleased with earthly friends and we may make idols of them, but we can
   never idolize Christ. We may worship Him, for He is God and He,
   therefore, deserves our homage and adoration. There is no fear that we
   can lavish too much affection upon His Divine Person. You may be well
   pleased with Him and be still more well pleased with Him, and be better
   pleased and better pleased, still, with Him the older you grow! And in
   Heaven, itself, you may still continue to be more and more completely
   taken up with Him, for is He not the river of pleasure which is at the
   right hand of God forever? Oh, yes! It is a blessed thing to have our
   good pleasure in Christ since it will endure world without end!

   But, once again, if you can say of Christ that you are well pleased
   with Him, I think it suggests to you a line of testimony. People need,
   sometimes, to say a word to others to do them good. Do you not think
   that it would be a very easy thing, sometimes, to say, "I wish you
   would let me tell you of a Friend of mine, and what He did for me"? You
   could not preach, perhaps, but you could, any one of you, tell the
   story of what Jesus did for you. "I do not know," says one, "I should
   break down if I tried." Well, that would not matter--it might be a
   grand thing to break down, as you might also break down the person to
   whom you were talking--and the two of you, breaking down, you might,
   perhaps, take to your knees and get nearer to God that way than in any
   other! I think that even the most humble Christian woman might find
   somebody, possibly of her own rank and sex, to whom she could say, "I
   would like to tell you about my dear Friend." Why, they might think
   they were going to hear a piece of gossip, you know! Perhaps they would
   lend their ears at once and then they would be surprised to find what a
   dear Friend is Jesus. Possibly they would be wonder struck--at any
   rate, I am sure they would remember it better than they would a sermon
   from me, because it would come with a surprise power which would take
   possession of their thoughts!

   "Oh, but," you say, "I could not speak that way." I do not believe that
   you could hold your tongue if you really tried to speak for Jesus. I
   believe that if you once began, you would be obliged to go on. I have
   heard of a good woman who said that she could not come before the
   Church to tell of her love to Christ. And when they said, "Well, then,
   we think we cannot receive you," she said, "But I could die for Him."
   "Oh!" said the minister, "that is better than anything else that you
   could say. If you say you could die for Christ, come along with you,
   you have already said enough." I do wish that, sometimes, as the Father
   said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," you would
   break the silence, and say, "This is my beloved Savior, in whom I am
   well pleased--

   'In the hea venly Lamb thrice happy I am, And my heart leaps at the
   sound of His name.' "I must tell somebody. I cannot keep such a good
   thing all to myself." I suggest it to you as a line of testimony, very
   simple and very easy to sincere-hearted persons, that you should
   imitate the Great Father in this respect and publicly or privately,
   according as you have opportunity, express your love to Christ.

   If anybody in this Tabernacle can say, "Yes, I am well pleased with
   Christ, I delight in Him," I think that fact may be to you a very
   blessed token for good. Faith in Christ ought to come first and I used
   to think it always did. But I correct myself as I go on learning. I
   meet with a great many persons who have a very sincere love to Christ,
   which love does not bring them any comfort, or bring them salvation,
   either, because they have not learned to trust Christ. The trust in
   Christ that saves the soul is not admiration of His Person or even love
   of Him--it is faith in His atoning Sacrifice, reliance upon His
   finished work. And if you are relying upon Him, you can then say, "I
   love Him, I delight in Him, I rejoice in everything about Him, He is
   very dear to me."

   Well now, how came this about? It is the work of Grace in your soul,
   for by nature we are enemies to God by wicked works, and if there is in
   your heart a trustful love for Jesus, so that you are well pleased with
   Him--depend upon it, the Spirit of God has been at work in your soul
   and you are a new creature in Christ Jesus! The kind of faith that I
   have seen in some, and which I am sure is good sound faith, is this.
   One said, "I believe myself to be the most unworthy creature who ever
   lived and I cannot understand why God should have the slightest love to
   such a wretch as I am. But I do trust myself on the merits of the Lord
   Jesus Christ with all my heart and I feel an inward union to Him. I
   love Him and I long to be with Him and, somehow, I feel certain that He
   will never cast me into Hell." No, dear Heart, how could He? How could
   He cast out one who loved Him? How could He cast out one who trusted
   Him? What? Shall it be said in Hell, "Here is a sinner who trusted the
   Savior"? Never! What? Shall they say, "Here is one in the unquenchable
   fire who was united to God in Christ Jesus"? It is impossible! Such a
   thing can never be! Therefore have no fear about it. With this trust in
   Christ you may live, you may die, you may rise again, you may stand in
   the Day of Judgement! If you are well pleased with Christ, God is well
   pleased with you. If you delight in Christ, God delights in you. This
   is a seal of the Spirit of God upon His work in your heart and you may
   go away and rejoice.

   Only take notice of this one thing. Imitation is the sincerest form of
   admiration and if you really, trustfully, love the Savior, you will
   endeavor to be like He. It will be your desire at all times to tread in
   His footsteps. "Well," says one, "I sincerely hope that I may do so.
   May the Holy Spirit help me! But one thing I know, I rejoice in my dear
   Savior's name." I can say that, too, yet, when I get home, tonight, it
   is very likely that I shall feel very, very, very weary and possibly,
   all of a sudden, a spirit of depression will come over me. It often
   does when one is very weary. And then I fall back on this fact--I did
   my best to extol my Master. I have preached nothing else but Christ
   and--

   "Ever since by faith I saw the stream His flowing wounds supply,
   Redeeming lo ve has been my theme, And shall be tiil I die," and He
   will not cast me away! I have no hope but in Him and He cannot put me
   away!

   O dear Souls, cling to my Lord! If you cannot do that, look to my Lord,
   trust to my Lord, be well pleased with my Lord and my Lord shall be
   well pleased with you! I do not ask of you a difficult thing, for, if
   ever there was One with whom we ought to be well pleased, it is the Son
   of God, who became the Son of Mary, that He might save us from our
   sins! Oh, think much of that wondrous love of His! If we do not admire
   it and love Him for it, surely our hearts are turned to stone! May God
   break them and give us new ones--and enable us henceforth to love
   Christ with all our heart, mind, soul and strength! Amen and Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 2; MA TTHEW 3.

   Psalm 2:1-3. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
   thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
   counsel together against the LORD, and against His Anointed, saying,
   Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
   The conspiracy was both strong and influential, The kings and the
   rulers combined against Jehovah and against His Christ. They were very
   determined. They set themselves with resolute purpose. They took
   counsel together. They were full of a horrible enthusiasm--they
   raged--they thought the work as good as done, but they imagined a vain
   thing. The fight was against Jehovah and against His Anointed, the
   Christ, the Messiah! What came of it all? Did they break their bands
   asunder and cast away their cords from them? Listen--

   4. He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
   derision. For what can mortals be as compared with the Eternal? The
   fire can readily enough consume the twigs. Shall men set themselves in
   opposition to Omnipotence and hope to prosper? And when God determines
   to glorify His anointed Son, shall worms of the dust prevent Him from
   doing so? What can come of all their opposition? God simply laughs at
   them--Jehovah has them in derision!

   5. Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore
   displeasure. He scarcely needs to lift His hand! He has only to speak
   and when Jehovah speaks in wrath, His words are thunderbolts! Men's
   hearts are indeed troubled when God's Words come hot with anger into
   their spirits. This is what God said--

   6. Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Zion. "You have raged,
   you have deliberated, you have resolved, but it is all nothing! There
   is My Son, the crowned King." And such is the Anointed tonight--the
   Christ is on the Throne--let His enemies say what they will, He must
   reign, nothing can prevent it! He must be King of kings and Lord of
   lords, for thus is it written concerning Him.

   7. I will declare the decree: the LORD has said unto Me, You are My
   Son; this day have I begotten You. This is the seal of the Anointed. He
   is the Son of the Highest, the only-begotten Son of the Father, who
   says to Him, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You."

   8. Ask of Me, and I shall give You the heathen for Your inheritance,
   and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession. Christ is
   asking of His Father--even He cannot have what He desires without
   asking for it! Prayer is so essential to the progress of the Kingdom of
   Christ that even Christ, Himself, must ask! But then God has promised
   to give to Christ the heathen for His inheritance, and the uttermost
   parts of the earth to be His possession. This is the great strength of
   all missionary enterprise. Dear Friends, we may be quite sure that the
   earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord when we read such a
   text as this--"I shall give You the heathen for Your inheritance, and
   the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession.'' If men will not
   yield to the Lord when He is made known to them. If they resist the
   drawings of Divine Love, what will happen? Listen--

   9. 10. You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in
   pieces, like a potter's vessel. Be wise now, therefore, O you kings: be
   instructed, you judges of the earth. "You rulers, you magistrates, you
   senators, you governors of the earth, be wise, be instructed."

   11. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. "If you are
   wise, you will obey the superior King--you will yield obedience to the
   great Lord of All."

   12. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when
   His wrath is kindled but a little. The kings and rulers are bid to do
   this--let each one of us do the same--let us give the kiss of homage to
   Him whom God has made to be our King and take Him to be our Lord and
   Ruler forever and ever.

   12. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him. It is so. Those
   of us who have tried it can bear our witness that it is so--there is no
   life like a life of trust in God. The nearest approach to Heaven that
   we can live in this mortal body is a life of simple confidence in the
   Lord Jesus Christ! Now let us read concerning our Lord's first coming
   and appearance among the sons of men. Turn to the Gospel according to
   Matthew, at the third chapter.

   Matthew 3:1, 2. In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
   wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent you: for the Kingdom of Heaven
   is at hand. There is no entering the Kingdom of Heaven without leaving
   the kingdom of darkness! We must repent of sin, or we cannot receive
   the blessings of salvation! Of every man, whoever he may be, whether
   outwardly moral or openly wicked, repentance is required. It is the
   door of hope--there is no other way into the Kingdom--"Repent you: for
   the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."

   3, 4. For this is He that was spoken of by the Prophet Isaiah, saying,
   The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the
   Lord, make His paths straight. And the same John had his raiment of
   camel's hair, and a belt about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
   wild honey. His raiment and his food were like his doctrine--rough and
   simple. There was no mincing of words, no making of pretty phrases with
   John the Baptist! His message was simply, "Repent you: repent you: for
   the Kingdom of Heaven is coming." We need more of this John the Baptist
   teaching nowadays, that men may be plainly told their faults and warned
   to put away those faults that they may receive Christ Jesus as their
   Savior!

   5-7. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region
   round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing
   their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
   his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who has warned
   you to flee from the wrath to come? These were the influential people
   of the times-- the Pharisees were the Ritualists of that age, and the
   Sadducees were the Rationalists of the period. Why, John, you ought to
   have smoothed your tongue, a bit, and have said some very pleasant
   words to these great men, for, by so doing, perhaps you might have won
   some of these Pharisees, or coaxed some of these Sadducees into the
   Kingdom! Ah, no, that is not John's method! He is plainspoken and he
   deals truthfully with his hearers, for he knows that converts made by
   flattery are but flattering converts that are of no real value!

   8, 9. Bring forth, therefore, fruits meet for repentance: and think not
   to say within ourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say unto
   you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
   Abraham! Pointing to the stones in the River Jordan and all along the
   banks, he said to the Pharisees and Sadducees, "There is nothing, after
   all, in your natural descent from Abraham. God has promised that
   Abraham shall have a seed, but think not that He is dependent upon you
   for that seed--He can fulfill His promise without you! He can turn the
   very pebbles of the stream into children for Abraham! God is not short
   of men to save. If some of you will not have Him, do not think that He
   shall have to come a-begging to you. There are others who will have Him
   and His rich Sovereign Grace will find them! Beware, you that are proud
   and think much of yourselves, for God will not humble Himself for you!
   He has regard to the humble and the lowly, but the proud He knows afar
   off."

   10-12. And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
   therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down,
   and cast into the fire. I indeed baptize you with water unto
   repentance: but He that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes
   I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and
   with fire, whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His
   floor, and gather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the
   chaff with unquenchable fire. The Christ is the Minister of Mercy, but
   there is about His Doctrine a searching and a trying power! Only the
   sincere in heart can endure Christ's winnowing fan. As for the
   insincere, they are blown away like the chaff on the threshing
   floor--their end is destruction! God give us to be numbered among the
   wheat that Christ shall gather into His heavenly garner!

   13, 14. Then came Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
   baptized of him. But John forbid Him, saying, I have need to be
   baptized of You, and come You to me? It seemed very strange that John,
   the servant, should be required to baptize Jesus, the Master.

   15. And Jesus answering said unto Him, suffer it to be so now: for thus
   it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him. That
   is to say the Teacher must, Himself, obey the laws which He is about to
   lay down. And, inasmuch as He is going to bid others to be baptized, He
   will set the example and be, Himself, baptized! I think, also, that the
   Baptism of Christ was the picture, the type, the symbol of the work
   which He afterwards accomplished. He was immersed in suffering. He died
   and was buried in the tomb. He rose again from the grave--and all that
   is set forth in the outward symbol of His baptism in the River Jordan!

   16, 17. And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out of the
   water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and He saw the Spirit
   of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon Him: and lo, a voice
   from Heaven, saying, This in My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
   And we are well pleased with Him, too.

Springtime in Nature and Grace

   (No. 2410)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 23, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   1, 1887.

   "For as the rain comes down and the snow from Heaven, andreturns not
   there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it
   may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: so shall My Word be
   that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return unto Me void, but
   it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the
   thing for which I sent it. For you shall go out with joy, and be led
   forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before
   you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
   hands. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of
   the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD
   for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off." Isaiah
   55:10-13.

   THIS is a text for the springtime! If you read it through tomorrow
   morning, before the smoke has clouded the heavens, while yet the
   earliest birds are calling up their mates to sing, you will understand
   its meaning better than I can make you comprehend it by any words of
   mine. The whole four verses seem to describe a scene in nature which is
   only to be witnessed about this time of the year, yet I am not going to
   look into the poetical meaning of the text so much as to use it as a
   description of personal experience. I think, no--I am sure that there
   are many of us who have passed through our spiritual winter. We have
   also had our spring--we are even coming to our summer--and there are
   some whose ripe and mellow experience has the peacefulness of autumn
   about it. Our lives are, in miniature, like the years that so quickly
   follow one another and every year does but repeat the changes in our
   lives! I want, at this time, to speak about springtime in our spiritual
   experience--touching, however, upon a more advanced period, as it will
   be necessary to do--but my first word is to be concerning our
   springtime experience.

   Brothers and Sisters, by nature we lie in the cold and death of
   winter--everything is frost-bound, withered, dead. We are nothing. We
   yield nothing. We can do nothing. The Word of God comes to us as the
   beams of the sun pour down their warmth from the heavens and, by a
   mighty and mysterious influence, that Word begins to work upon us and
   we soon feel that we have entered upon quite another season of life. We
   are no longer in the cold winter--we have come to a blessed springtime!
   That is the theme upon which I am going to now speak.

   I. First, notice in the text the descent of the Word, THE
   DOWNCOMING--"As the rain comes down, and the snow from Heaven."

   Our spring begins with April showers alternating with rough winds.
   There is sure to be, at this period of the year, a rainy season to
   prepare the earth for bringing forth fruit, to swell the buds on the
   trees and to work with sunshine to produce the spring. So is it
   spiritually--the coming down of the Word of God is, to our hearts, like
   the falling of the rain from Heaven.

   Concerning this coming down, I may say, first, that it is usually
   unpleasant. We are accustomed to speak of rainy weather and especially
   of snowy weather, as, "bad" weather. We are the wisest people in the
   world in matters relating to the weather. Having, as some say, no
   "climate"--only "weather"--we talk a great deal about it and inform
   each other what kind of weather it is when one can see just as well as
   the other what it is! Now, when we spiritually begin to live, it is
   usually rough weather and we are apt to think it is bad weather. Drip,
   drip, drip, fall showers of repentance. Snow-flake after snowflake
   falls and buries all our hopes. Our joys are covered as with a
   winding-sheet. It is bad weather with us and we are not slow to
   complain of it. Oh, dear Friends, if we did but know how God is
   blessing us--if we could but realize that these experiences are working
   out our lasting good--we would thank God that His Word comes down upon
   us as the rain and the snow fall from Heaven!

   The work of Grace in our hearts, however, is like a spring shower in
   another respect. It differs very much in its method, for rain and snow
   do not always come down in the same way. Sometimes the rain fails very
   gently--we can hardly tell whether it is rain or not. Our Scotch
   friends would call it "a mist." At another time, the rain, like Jehu
   the son of Nimshi, drives furiously. Big drops come pouring down and
   before we can reach a shelter we are wet through and through. So is it
   with the snow--it falls at times as gently as the dropping of tiny
   feathers, but it may descend thick and fast--a blizzard blowing it into
   our faces and almost blinding us. So, there are some to whom God's Word
   comes very softly. It does come, but it comes without tempest or storm.
   There are others to whom it comes very terribly--the Word of the Lord
   is full of dread to them--it is a tempest, a whirlwind. The rain or the
   snow comes down to them and there is no mistaking it--they are shivered
   through and through with its cold, they are wet to the skin with its
   moisture! Therefore, learn this, you who have been comparing yourselves
   with others, that as the rain at one time differs from the rain at
   another time, and as the snow in one place varies from the snow in
   another place, and yet the rain is always rain, and the snow is always
   snow, so the entrance of Divine Grace into one heart differs from the
   way it enters into another, yet it is always the same Grace!

   In like manner, Brothers and Sisters, the coming down of the snow and
   of the rain differs, also, in time and in quantity. One shower is
   quickly over and another lasts all day and all night. The snow may in
   one season fall heavily for a few hours only. At another time, a week
   of snow may be experienced. So, the work of Divine Grace, when it
   begins in the soul, is not very manifestly the same in different
   persons. Some of us were, for years, subject to the operations of God's
   Spirit, and endured much pain and sorrow before we found peace in
   believing. Others find Christ in a few minutes and leap out of darkness
   into light by a single spring! I have known some whose convictions have
   been so brief and have been so completely swallowed up by their almost
   immediate faith, that it has been a trouble to them to know whether
   they were ever truly convinced of sin at all! On the other hand, I have
   known many who have been so long shut up in Giant Despair's dungeons
   that they have thought that they were the men in the iron cage--that
   they were given over to destruction and could never find salvation!
   Judge nothing, I pray you, after this fashion, but remember that God's
   Word, as it comes down like the rain and the snow from Heaven, yet has
   varied methods of reaching different hearts.

   One thing more I may say about this coming down of the Word of God and
   that is, it is always a blessing, and never a curse. If the rain should
   pour down very heavily and continue to fall until we might be led to
   think that the very heavens would weep themselves away, yet, Brothers
   and Sisters, it can never produce a flood that would drown the world,
   for yonder in the heavens is the rainbow of the Covenant! These rains
   must mean blessing, they cannot mean destruction. And if the snow
   should fall ever so deep, yet not even by snow will God destroy the
   earth any more than by a flood. So, when God's Grace comes streaming
   into the heart, it may produce deep conviction, it may sweep away the
   refuges of lies, it may cover up and bury beneath its fall every carnal
   hope--but it cannot be a flood to destroy you! There shall yet come a
   change of weather for you and your soul shall live. Let the Grace of
   God but come and let that Grace come how it may--it is always a
   benediction to the man who receives it.

   Thus have I described to you the first part of our spiritual
   springtime, when, at last, our long winter begins to yield beneath the
   sunlight of Divine Grace. The Word of the Lord comes down upon us like
   the snow and the rain that fall upon the earth.

   II. The second thing to notice in our text is, THE ABIDING. We have had
   the coming down--now follows the abiding of the rain or the snow that
   comes down from Heaven--"it returns not there, but waters the earth."
   So is it spiritu-ally--when God's Grace falls from Heaven, it comes to
   stay!

   My dear Hearers, this morning [Sermon #1961, Volume 33--S.S.--Or, the
   Sinner Saved] I had to complain of some that they were like the rock
   upon which the rain falls, but which it never enters. It drops upon the
   granite and runs down the side of it, but produces no result. But when
   God sends His Grace from Heaven, you may know it by this sign--soaks
   into your soul! Oh, how much of my preaching there is, and how much of
   other people's preaching there is, that reaches the ears and that is
   the end of it! Oh, for hearers who drink in the Word of the Lord! O
   rain from Heaven, would God that you did always find us like plowed
   fields ready to drink you in! This is how Grace works--it enters the
   soul, penetrates the heart, saturates the conscience, abides in the
   memory, affects the affections, gives understanding to the
   understanding and imparts real life to the heart--which is the seat of
   life! I wish that we always heard the Gospel in that fashion, but
   hearing is often mere child's play. If it were true hearing, it would
   be the most serious work under Heaven and it would be done in a
   reverential manner as a true part of Divine worship! Then we should
   find the Word of God soaking into men's hearts as the snow and the rain
   from Heaven enter the earth.

   It appears from our text that this downpour, instead of returning to
   Heaven, does this, also, for the soul into which it soaks--it
   fertilizes it, it makes the soul bring forth and bud. Yes, but the
   metaphor of my text cannot set forth the whole Truth, for this Word of
   God, which is the rain, is also the Seed. This Word of God, which is
   the snow, is the living Seed, itself. What would we think of clouds
   that rained down seeds? That would be a new thing beneath the heavens,
   yet it is the old thing, after all! The Word of God is the living and
   incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever and whenever that
   Seed is sown, God's Word comes soaking into the soul, making the soul
   live, and causing the heart to yield its life up to the living Seed. I
   cannot distinguish between the Seed and the soil in my metaphor, for it
   seems as if the very soil did breed the Seed and take it up into
   itself, and cause it to grow, causing it to bring forth and bud. O
   Beloved, if the Word of God has been to you like an uncomfortable
   shower, may it afterwards prove its living power, making you feel a new
   life that you never felt before, a something within, struggling,
   striving, a something which, of itself, was not previously there, but
   which comes with the heavenly Word and is, indeed, the sure evidence of
   the beginning of the new life within your soul!

   And, again, the Word of God, when it comes into the soul and abides
   there, works in the man whatever God pleases-- all His Divine
   purposes--"it shall accomplish that which I please and prosper in the
   thing for which I sent it." It is a very wonderful thing to get the
   Word of God thoroughly into your soul, to get soaked and saturated with
   it. We have, none of us, any idea what that Word may yet do for us. Who
   among us knows the Infinite reaches of the Divine purpose? Who shall
   cast the lead and fathom all the Divine intentions concerning man?
   Verily, "it does not yet appear what we shall be," but when the Word of
   God is truly in us, it will work whatever the Divine purpose is and
   carry it out to the fullest without fail, for the Word of God is living
   and powerful to effect the designs and purposes of the Most High!

   My beloved Hearers, open your hearts to this Word--drink it in--do not
   stay its course, do not try to hinder its Divine operations. Pray to be
   completely under its influence, for you do not know how holy, how
   strong, how happy, how heavenly you may yet be! This, then, is how our
   spiritual springtime comes to us--first, showers under which we tremble
   and are troubled, but, afterwards, a Divine abiding which produces
   marvelous effects in our hearts and lives!

   III. So, in the third place, I will briefly speak to you about THE
   RESULTS of the coming down and the abiding. The rain has come and the
   rain remains. Now what happens?

   First, we are told, it makes the earth to bring forth and bud. I love
   the time of buds. There is nothing more beautiful than the rosebud--it
   is more charming, by far, than the full-blown rose! And the buds of all
   manner of flowers have a singular charm about them. But when the Grace
   of God has come into a young man's heart, we very soon see his buds--
   he has gracious purposes, he has holy resolves, he has the beginnings
   of prayer, he has the makings of a man of God about him! Childhood in
   Grace is a sweet budding time with many rare beauties and delights.
   Some of you, perhaps, are complaining of yourselves that you have not
   yet come to the perfection of flowering. Do not murmur on that account,
   but be thankful if you have only a bud. A little prayer, a faint desire
   after holiness, a hungering and thirsting after righteous-ness--these
   are buds--be grateful for them! There are some birds that like to eat
   the buds of trees and they do much mischief to the garden. And there
   are some old Christians who, I think, are rather too fond of nipping
   buds, and so doing damage to young beginners. May God keep these
   destructive birds away from you who, as yet, are but feeble.

   Beloved, if you are what the Lord would have you to be, you will not
   long be content with buds. If you serve the Lord and the Lord continues
   to visit you with showers of blessing, you will soon bring forth seed
   for the sower. You, yourself, will become useful to others. Your
   experience, your knowledge, your service will become the seed of good
   for other people. The devil can never destroy the Church of God, or
   banish it altogether from the face of the earth, because, if there were
   only one Christian left in the world, he would be seed for other
   Christians, and I cannot tell you how many might spring from him! If
   all of us should die and there were only one of the dear children left
   who have lately joined this Church, yet the Church of God would spring
   up and flourish, again, from that one child! That Grace which first
   comes to you and fills you with conviction of sin, afterwards comes to
   you to make you to be the seed-corn for others!

   Grace also makes us produce bread for the eater. I was thinking, today,
   that next Tuesday (May 3rd, 1887,) it will be just 37 years since I was
   baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Spirit! Up to that day, I had never opened my mouth for Christ. I had
   not even engaged in prayer at a Prayer Meeting, for I was very
   diffident and I was afraid to speak of spiritual things! I was not very
   old, so perhaps my timidity might be excused, but, 37 years ago, when I
   gave myself to Christ, I could not have imagined that I should stand
   here, tonight, to preach the Word to these thousands of people. The
   "bud" of that day has been "seed to the sower" and, blessed be God, it
   is still "bread to the eater." Oh, young men, you do not know what God
   can make of you! Young women, if you consecrate yourselves to Christ
   and come under the saturating influence of the Divine Word, you do not
   know how many your lips may feed, nor how many your word may even
   convert to Christ! You, too, shall furnish seed to the sower and bread
   to the eater. You may, perhaps, at first pass through a painful
   experience in which you will be made to see your own worthlessness, but
   you will, in due time, come out into a joyful experience in which God
   shall bless you, increase your usefulness and make you to be a blessing
   to those who are round about you!

   There is one other thing that must be noticed under this head. The
   result of Divine Grace upon the heart is very amazing, so that I can
   hardly bring it under the metaphor of rain and snow, for it works a
   transformation. When rain falls on a plot of ground, if it is covered
   with weeds, it makes the weeds grow. But in the spiritual realm, the
   rain that comes down from Heaven, itself, sows the ground with good
   seed. What is more amazing, where it falls, it transforms the ground
   and the plants that come under its influence change their nature!
   "Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree." If you were in
   Australia, you might see leagues of land covered with huge thistles and
   thorns. Down comes this shower of Grace upon man's nature, thus covered
   with thorns and, instead of thorns, come up fir trees--useful,
   delightful objects in the landscape--not gnarled and twisted thorns,
   but fair and comely fir trees!

   "And instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree." When the
   Grace of God begins to work, a change is made in those who are like
   briers and they become like myrtles! Out at Mentone there are large
   tracts of land covered with myrtles, rosemary and other odoriferous
   plants. Often have I thrown myself down upon them as upon a spring bed,
   for they grow close together, and, as you rest upon them, a delightful
   perfume is round about you everywhere. Now, when the Grace of God comes
   into the soul, it takes the obnoxious things in us and transmutes them
   into blessings. Here is a man who is naturally of an obstinate
   disposition. You know him. When the Grace of God comes into his heart,
   he becomes firm in his attachment to the Truth of God. A fine character
   can be made out of an obstinate man--he is the one of whom you can make
   a martyr if necessary--he would be willing to burn for Christ's sake!
   You would never find him flinching.

   Here is another person who is full of levity and trifling. The Grace of
   God comes and transforms that lightness into cheerfulness and
   amiability. He is the light of the house, you are glad to know such a
   person. "Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead
   of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree." This is wonderful Grace,
   is it not? I hope that some of us are now undergoing its transforming
   power in our hearts! This springtime of Grace is charming, far beyond
   that of nature, for nature, in her developments, still continues to
   bring forth the primeval thorns and thistles which our father, Adam, by
   his disobedience, brought to us. But the Grace of God changes these
   evil things and makes the soul to bring forth that which is good,
   pleasing, sweet and profitable--both to God and man!

   IV. Now I have come to my last point. We have considered the coming
   down, the abiding and the result of the rain. Now let us notice THE
   REJOICING.

   This is a time ofjoy--the music of the year is full in springtime.
   Birds get silent towards the end of autumn. That is the Sabbath of the
   year. God's bounty, then, has become so manifold that nature seems to
   feel that she cannot express her gratitude and even the birds, as a
   rule, are silent, then, but now they are bursting into song as trees
   are bursting into leaves and plants are bursting into flowers! I want
   that to be your experience in this springtime. I saw, the other day,
   outside a certain place of worship (!), the notice of "a free and
   easy." I wonder what kind of worship that is? However, though I do not
   know and cannot imagine, yet I should like you who are the Lord's to
   feel wonderfully "free and easy" in the highest sense! Now that the
   winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the
   earth and the time of the singing of birds is come, let every child of
   God enjoy himself, for our text says, "You shall go out with joy, and
   be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth
   before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap
   their hands." Why should we be so happy? Why should everything about us
   be so happy? Let us run the parallel between springtime in nature and
   in Grace.

   In springtime, one cause of happiness is new life. Things have been
   dead, but they are now springing into life. The blood runs more quickly
   within our veins--our whole being now seems warm with the new life that
   courses through our nature! It is so spiritually. We have come into a
   new life, the Holy Spirit has breathed upon us and we live and, blessed
   be God, that life never gets old! After knowing the Lord these 37
   years, as I have told you, I feel His love to be as sure as ever, and
   the power of His Grace as powerful as ever. There is a constant novelty
   about the life of faith. The mercies of God are new every morning and
   fresh every evening. Well, then, since you have a life of which you
   knew nothing before, since you can see all around you the tokens of a
   life which you never perceived before, be glad! Sing, tonight, you
   songsters of the Lord! Break out into sweet music because of the new
   life within you--that new life which can never die, but which shall, in
   due season, be enlarged and perfected into life forever before the
   Throne of God above!

   Another source of joy in springtime is to be found in our happy
   surroundings. It is beginning to be warm. We hope, soon, to be able to
   sit out of doors in the sunshine. We trust that the dull and heavy
   clouds will not return and that the winds which pierced us to our very
   marrow will now be withheld from us. So we feel happy in the advent of
   spring and is it not so with us spiritually? We are no longer in
   bondage and no longer in fear! "Being justified by faith, we have peace
   with God." Reconciled through the blood of Jesus Christ, our Lord, we
   joy in God. Let us be happy together and, coming to this table, whereon
   are spread the memorials of our Lord's great love to us, let us not
   come with dull and heavy hearts, as though we were assembled at a
   funeral, but let us meet in joyful anticipation of the day when we
   shall sit down at the marriage supper of the Lamb in Glory! New life
   and happy surroundings should make us clap our hands and rejoice before
   the Lord!

   Springtime, I think, is peculiarly pleasant because of its large
   promise. We are thinking of the hay harvest and of the fruit of the
   fields. We are reckoning upon luscious grapes and upon the various
   fruits which faith sees to be hidden within the blossoms. Yes, but may
   not our hopes be disappointed if we reckon upon earthly fruits? But you
   and I have come, by Grace, into a land of hope most sure and steadfast!
   We have hopes grounded on God's Word and they shall never be
   disappointed! Let us be happy, then, since we shall certainly one day
   be in Heaven! Let us begin the music of Heaven down here. Since our
   Lord is on His way back to us and may arrive before this assembly
   breaks up, let us anticipate the joy of His glorious appearing. May God
   the Holy Spirit help us to think of all these choice mercies, that we
   may be glad in the

   Lord!

   In springtime, once more, there always seems to me to be a peculiar
   sense of Divine Power and Divine Presence throughout all nature. It is
   as if nature had swooned, awhile, and lay in her cold fit through the
   winter, but now she has been awakened. Her Lord has looked her in the
   face and charmed her back to life! I trust that you and I feel this
   peculiar Presence of God in the highest sense. Some say that there is
   no God. Ah, me! Ah, me! Blind men say that there is no sun, perhaps,
   but they must be very blind if they think so. We know that there is a
   God, not only by the argument from design, which is a very strong one,
   but by better evidence than that. We have had dealings with God,
   personal dealings with Him, as when the sun, though it is ninety-five
   millions of miles away, has commerce with the earth, and the bulbs that
   sleep beneath the black mold begin to swell and grow and, by-and-by,
   the yellow cup is held up to be filled with the light of the sun! There
   must be a sun, we know, because of all its warmth and genial glow, and
   the life force with which it charms the earth into the revival of
   spring! And though we have not seen God at any time, neither can
   conceive of Him in all His Glory, for He is essentially inconceivable,
   yet have we felt His Power charming into life our hope, our faith, our
   love! Sometimes, as the sun may be, for a while, hidden from us, a
   cloud obscures our God. Ah, me! What darkness then returns to us--how
   do all the young shoots seem to droop in the blackness! But when that
   cloud is gone and the light comes streaming out, again, O Lord, how we
   rejoice, how strong, how bright, how happy we are! If we have not
   wings, yet do we learn to fly without wings--we soon mount aloft when
   God, Himself, draws us towards Himself.

   If you do not know God, my dear Hearer, conclude that there is a life
   which you have not yet discovered. As Columbus found a new world when
   his ships steered across the Atlantic, so may you yet discover a new
   world which you have not seen as yet. May God, Himself, steer your ship
   and bring you there! But do not tell us that there is no God, and no
   such new world--you cannot prove a negative, but we can prove a
   positive--namely, that we have entered into a new life, we have been in
   the new world! Suppose that I were to try to teach astronomy to a
   horse. I could not make him understand me, but if I possessed the power
   to put an immortal soul into that horse, how easily would his eyes look
   through the telescope and how speedily would he begin to rejoice in sun
   and moon and stars!

   You, my dear Hearers, who are without God, are nothing but a soulish
   man at present, almost a brute man in some respects. There is a higher
   spirit that you need--oh, that you had it! God the Holy Spirit can
   breathe it into you. That is what we mean by regeneration. When He
   imparts a new and higher nature and when you have received that nature,
   then you will be able to say, "There is a God, for I perceive Him. I
   also have entered a new world. Things are the same as they used to be
   and yet they are wonderfully different! I see nothing as I used to see
   it. Before, I saw it as a brutish man, but now I see it as a man
   twice-born, who has become so exalted as to be near akin to God,
   Himself."

   Then, dear Friends, when you reach that state, "You shall go out with
   joy and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall
   break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field
   shall clap their hands." God give you saving faith and this new life of
   which I have been speaking, through Jesus Christ His Son! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH55; PSALM 136.

   Hear these Inspired words, dear Friends, as though they came fresh from
   Heaven, as though God Himself spoke them at this moment out of the
   excellent Glory, for, indeed, He does so. The Word of God never grows
   old--these messages are just as new as if the ink on the pens of the
   Prophet and the Psalmist were not yet dry.

   Isaiah 55:1. Ho! Everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters. This
   invitation is not given to you who are full, to you who can satisfy
   your own needs out of the buckets of your own righteousness. No, the
   Prophet speaks to you thirsty ones who feel an awful necessity which
   will not let you rest. Hunger you may appease, but thirst is
   terrible--none can long bear its pangs. "Ho, everyone that thirsts."
   Whatever your age, sex, character, rank, or position in life, if you do
   but thirst, then the Gospel stands with uplifted finger, and cries to
   you, "Ho!" as do merchants and traders who want to dispose of their
   wares.

   1. And he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy
   wine and milk without money and without price. In the Lord Jesus Christ
   there is all you need and more than you know that you need! As yet you
   only thirst, but here is bread for your hunger as well as drink for
   your thirst. Whereas "waters" might seem to satisfy your thirst, here
   is a superfluity of Grace, an exceeding abundance of mercy--"Come, buy
   wine and milk without money and without price." Christ is as free as
   the air! As you have only to take in the air by breathing, in order to
   live by it, so have you only to receive Christ into your soul and you
   live by Him! As flows old Father Thames through the green meadows, and
   every dog may come and lap, and every ox may stand knee-deep in the
   stream, for there is none to keep even an animal away, so is it with
   Christ--"Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."

   2. Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? Why are you so
   busy about your ceremonies, your works, your feelings--none of which
   can yield food for your soul? Come to Christ and buy without money the
   Bread of Life which came down from Heaven!

   2. And your wages for that which satisfies not? Listen diligently to
   me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in
   fatness. If we will but hear the Gospel, and attentively hear it,
   "faith comes by hearing," and that faith leads us to Jesus Christ! And
   in Him we find that which is substantial, solid--the very thing we
   need. We find in Christ all that is super-excellent, so that our soul
   delights itself in fatness. I have no lean Christ to preach to you! No
   half-starved salvation that will drag you into Heaven and save you, "so
   as by fire." But in coming to Christ, you are invited to "let your soul
   delight itself in fatness." A Christian cannot be too happy--"the joy
   of the Lord" is beyond all description! You must taste it to prove its
   sweetness. As honey among the sweets, such is the joy of the Lord among
   joys! Yes, as the sun and the lesser lights in the sky, such is the joy
   of Christ compared with all other delights that men can ever know! "Let
   your soul delight itself in fatness."

   3. Incline your ear. You know what that means--bend forward to catch
   the faintest utterance of the voice that is speaking.

   3. And come unto Me; hear, and your soul shall live. We do not live by
   sight. All the pretty things that you can see in a Roman Catholic place
   of worship will not save a single soul! The preaching of the Gospel is
   God's way of salvation-- "Hear, and your soul shall live." Christ rides
   into the City of Mansoul through Ear-Gate. Take heed what you hear and
   take heed how you hear!

   3. And I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure
   mercies of David. Think of God making a Covenant with you! This is a
   very wonderful thing. You may almost leap for joy at the thought that
   God should ever enter into Covenant with you. You think very little of
   yourself and reckon yourself to be among the most obscure of mankind.
   "Yet," says the Lord God, "I will strike hands with you and be your
   Friend, and pledge My Word to you. Yes, and make a Covenant with
   you--and an Everlasting Covenant it shall be, too. Surely, blessing, I
   will bless you." Oh, what a wonder of Divine Grace it is that God
   should enter into Covenant with sinful man! "Even the sure mercies of
   David." You know what David this is--this is the Son of David, the
   inheritor of great David's name, "great David's greater Son."

   4. Beheld, I have given Him for a witness to the people, a leader and
   commander to the people. Jesus Christ is a witness to you of His
   Father's love. I do not know how God could show His love more fully
   than He does in the life and death of His Son, Jesus Christ. Christ is
   the great Witness of the Father's love! Behold how He loves His people
   in that He gives His Son to die for them! Will you not clasp hands with
   God across this great Sacrifice of His only-begotten Son? Let us do so,
   now, again, as we have often done before. "I have given Him for a
   witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people." If He
   leads, let us follow. If He commands, let us obey. His command is that
   we are to believe in His name and to be baptized in His name--let us
   not be disobedient to any part of His holy will. Now comes a promise
   made to our great Leader, our Covenant Head--

   5. Behold, You shall call a nation that You know not, and nations that
   knew not You shall run unto You because of the LORD Your God, and for
   the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified You. That is, Jehovah has
   glorified Christ. It is promised that multitudes shall come to Him.
   "You shall call a nation that You know not." He never saw you in His
   House before. He never knew you to fall on your knees in prayer, but He
   is calling even you, by His Grace and by His Gospel! You are here,
   tonight, and He is calling you, even you! Therefore, come to Him at
   once! There are some, here, who do not know Christ Jesus our Lord. They
   are strangers to His love and to His power to save, but the promise is
   that, "nations that knew not You shall run unto You." That implies
   speed--it is a double quick march. Oh, that many sinners would at once
   run to Christ! Some who often hear the Gospel are very slow in coming
   to Christ, but I pray that some of you who do not know as much of it as
   they do, may run to Christ at once and be saved by Him. It is a blessed
   thing to take Christ at the first time of asking. Love to Christ at
   first sight is the wisest kind of love that can be! May it be largely
   bestowed on many of you! Listen to these next words

   6. 7. Seek you the LORD while He may be found, call you upon Him while
   He is near: let the wicked forsake His ways, and the unrighteous man
   his thoughts and let him return unto the LORD, and He will have mercy
   upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. Hear the music
   of the glorious message, "He will have mercy!" "He will abundantly
   pardon!" Return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon you! He will
   abundantly pardon you!

   8, 9. For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My
   ways says the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so
   are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.
   Perhaps you are thinking that He cannot forgive you, that He cannot
   possibly mean that He will blot out your sins? But He does mean it,
   yes, and He is willing to do it now! Oh, that you would come to your
   pardoning God through Jesus Christ His dear Son!

   10-13. For as the rain comes down, and the snow from Heaven, and
   returns not there, but waters the earth and makes it bring forth and
   bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: so
   shall My Word be that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return
   unto Me void but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall
   prosper in the thing for which I sent it. For you shall go out with
   joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall
   break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field
   shall clap their hands. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir
   tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it
   shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not
   be cut off. Now let us read the 136th Psalm.

   Psalm 136:1-3. O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His
   mercy endures forever. O give thanks unto the God of gods: for His
   mercy endures forever. O give thanks to the Lord of lords for His mercy
   endures forever. In this Psalm we have the same refrain repeated 26
   times! The words--"for His mercy endures forever," were probably
   intended to be taken up as a chorus by all the people in and round
   about the Temple at their solemn festivals. But though there is
   repetition, there is no tautology, for the saints of God are so fond of
   God's praise that they can never have too much of it. I am sure that if
   you have ever tasted the faithful mercy of God in Covenant with His
   people, you will never hear this sentence once too often! "For His
   mercy endures forever" will be a sound that shall be most welcome to
   your ears. You will observe that, first of all, the praise is to the
   Lord's Person--"O give thanks unto Jehovah.. .the God of gods...the
   Lord of lords: for His mercy endures forever." Next, the praise turns
   upon His works.

   4-9. To Him who alone does great wonders: for His mercy endures
   forever. To Him that by wisdom made the heavens: for His mercy endures
   forever. To Him that stretched out the earth above the waters: His
   mercy endures forever. To Him that made great lights, for His mercy
   endures forever: the sun to rule by day: for His mercy endures forever:
   the moon and stars to rule by night: for His mercy endures forever. In
   the works of Creation and in the dispensations of Providence, we have
   abundant proofs of the perpetuity of God's lovingkindness. No sooner
   have we experienced the blessings of the day than the mercies of the
   night follow quickly upon their heels! If we look up to the heavens, we
   have instances of God's mercy, there, in kindling the stars and
   lighting the sun and moon. And if we look upon the waters, and the land
   that stands above them, we still see God's lovingkindness. That man is
   intensely blind who can see nothing of love and kindness in Creation!
   You have but to open your eyes anywhere to see that the whole earth is
   full of the mercy of God! Still, the loudest song belongs to God's
   dealings with His Church and, therefore, in the 10th verse, we come to
   God's deliverance of His peculiar people, His chosen Israel, in which
   we also have our share, for in Abraham's seed all the nations of the
   earth are blessed this day.

   10-15. To Him that smote Egypt in their first-born: for His mercy
   endures forever: and brought out Israel from among them: for His mercy
   endures forever: with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for
   His mercy endures forever. To Him which divided the Red Sea into parts:
   for His mercy endures forever: and made Israel to pass through the
   midst of it: for His mercy endures forever: but overthrew Pharaoh and
   his host in the Red Sea: for His mercy endures forever. And you and I
   have experienced deliverances of the same kind! Our troubles have been
   overcome; our sins have been forgiven; we have been preserved by God's
   goodness and guided by His Wisdom. Let us, therefore, sing of that
   Covenant faithfulness and of that Immutable Truth of God which have
   never left us!

   16-18. To Him which led His people through the wilderness, for His
   mercy endures forever. To Him which smote great kings: for His mercy
   endures forever: and slew famous kings, for His mercy endures forever.
   We are far too slow to recall the special mercies of God. We have,
   here, a bright example given us, not only to remember God's goodness in
   the lump, but in detail. We are, as it were, to take His mercies to
   pieces, that we may see fresh grounds for thanksgiving in every
   separate section!

   19-23. Sihon king of the Amorites: for His mercy endures forever: and
   Og the king of Bashan: for His mercy endures forever: and gave their
   land for an heritage: for His mercy endures forever: even an heritage
   unto Israel, His servant: for His mercy endures forever. Who remembered
   us in our low estate: for His mercy endures forever. Here is a song for
   us--"Who remembered us in our low estate." We were brought low by sin,
   by conviction, by ignorance, by our own powerless-ness--but, low as we
   were, "He remembered us in our low estate: for His mercy endures
   forever."--

   "He sent His Son with power to save From guilt, and darkness, and the
   grave! Wonders of Grace to God belong, Repeat His mercies in your
   song." 24-26. And has redeemed us from our enemies: for His mercy
   endures forever. Who gives food to all flesh: for His mercy endures
   forever. O give thanks unto the God of Heaven for His mercy endures
   forever. Thus the Psalm finishes upon its keynote--"for His mercy
   endures forever." May that be the keynote both of our daily song and of
   our eternal hymn of praise unto the Lord! Amen.

Why Some Seekers Are Not Saved

   (No. 2411)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 5, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   8, 1887.

   "Behold the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither
   His ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated
   between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you,
   that He will not hear." Isaiah 59:1,2.

   THERE are some people who are not saved though we would have expected
   that they would have been converted long ago. Our text explains the
   reason, so, without any preface, let us come to it at once.

   I. First, let us consider THE FACT CONFESSED! The people of whom I am
   especially thinking, just now, have been hearers of the Gospel, and
   diligent hearers, too. Their seat is seldom vacant and they are not
   among those who go to sleep during the sermon. They do not enjoy the
   Sunday after the fashion of the countryman, who said that he liked that
   day best because he could go to church, put up his feet, fall asleep
   and think of nothing at all. The people to whom I am referring really
   listen to what the preacher has to say. They are attentive and they
   seek to retain in their memories the Truths of God he preaches. They
   even talk when they are at home of the striking passages, if such there
   are, in what they have heard. You would suppose that such persons would
   get a blessing from the Gospel, yet they do not.

   They have now been listening for years to an earnest minister--they
   would not like to hear one who was not earnest. They have grown to be
   somewhat discriminating in their taste--they know what is the Gospel
   and they would not care to be present at a service in which the Gospel
   was not clearly set forth. Yet, for all this, they are not saved! They
   stand out in the shower, yet they are not wet! They are like Gideon's
   fleece, perfectly dry when all the ground was saturated with the dew.
   This is a strange circumstance, but, alas, by no means an uncommon one!
   We would not have thought that there could be such people, but we are
   compelled to believe that there are, for we frequently stumble across
   them--people who are often sitting under the sound of the Gospel, yet
   who never hear it with the ears of their heart! The light shines upon
   their eyes, yet they do not see it, for thick scales seem to be there
   to hide from them the beams of the sun.

   You will be, perhaps, still more surprised when I add that there are
   some people who go beyond hearing and yet are not saved. They have
   become men of prayer, after a fashion--are they not described in the
   chapter I read to you? [Exposition of Isaiah 58 at end of
   sermon--ED.]"Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, as a
   nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinances of their
   God: they ask of Me the ordinances of justice, they take delight in
   approaching God." These people are in such a state of mind that if they
   went to their business without the repetition of a form of prayer, they
   would be uneasy through the whole day! What is more, it is not merely a
   form of prayer--in some cases there is a measure of life, desire and
   earnestness in their devotions. Only this morning, one of them sighed
   when the sermon was over and he said, "Oh, that I could be a friend of
   God!"

   And a few Sunday nights ago, the one of whom I am speaking, when he
   reached his home, fell on his knees in his own private room and asked
   God to bless the Word to his soul. This same thing happened to him ten
   or even 20 years ago-- he has often been stirred up and driven to his
   knees in prayer--yet he has gone no further, but still remains, to his
   own consciousness, an undecided, hesitating person, on the borders of
   the Kingdom of God, yet not in the Kingdom--almost persuaded, yet not
   fully persuaded to be a Christian! You know, dear Hearers, and I hardly
   need tell you, that a man who is almost honest is a rogue, and the man
   who is almost a Christian is not a Christian! There was a man who was
   almost saved in a fire, but he was burned to death! There was another
   who was almost healed of a disease, but he died! There was one who was
   almost reprieved, but he was hanged--and there are many in Hell who
   were almost saved!

   I am not talking, now, just to be talking. I know that with some of my
   most hopeful hearers, it is just as I have been describing it--they
   hear the Gospel and they pray to God, yet they have not gone beyond
   those outward exercises--they have not believed in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and they have not received Him into their hearts as their own
   personal Savior.

   I know, also, that these people are greatly disappointed with
   themselves. Not altogether so, for they know, to a great extent, where
   the blame lies, but yet they had hoped better things of themselves. If
   anyone had told them, ten, 12, or 20 years ago, that they would be
   where they now are, each one of them would have said, "I hope that will
   not be the case with me! I trust that, long before the time you
   mention, I shall have cast in my lot with the people of God and shall
   have been saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation." They are
   still hoping, but their hope is curdling into doubt and their doubt is
   souring into despair--and I am very fearful lest that despair should
   lead them into still greater sin!

   I want to speak especially to these friends. I shall do it with much
   kindness of heart towards them, but I wish to do it, also, with equal
   faithfulness, praying all the while that what I say may help them to
   escape from their present unsatisfactory and unsafe position.

   II. So, in the second place, I call their attention to THE IMPUTATION
   IMPLIED AND MET. It is suggested to some, that inasmuch as they are not
   saved though they have put themselves in the way of saving ordinances,
   and though they have sought salvation, perhaps salvation is not so
   easily to be had as it used to be--perhaps Christ cannot save them as
   He has saved others!

   Notice the first word of our text--"Behold." This is like our nota
   bene--mark well, turn your eye this way, Ecce-- "Behold, the Lord's
   hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither His ear heavy, that
   it cannot hear." You are called upon to mark this--distinctly to see
   it--and to entertain no doubt about it! If you are not saved, it is not
   because God is unable to save you, nor is it because He is unwilling to
   hear your prayers!

   Listen to this word, for it is God Himself who speaks it. He knows
   whether His hand is palsied, or whether His ear is deaf and, He,
   Himself, declares that His hand is not shortened that it cannot save,
   and that His ear is not heavy that it cannot hear. If you have any
   doubt about this fact, I recommend you to prove it for yourselves--come
   by faith to Jesus, and see whether He will save you. We sang just now--

   "Venture on Him, venture wholly," and if you think that it is a
   venture, if you fancy that, perhaps, the blood of Christ cannot cleanse
   you, or the Spirit of God cannot renew you, come and put the matter to
   the test! Dare, now, to cast yourself at Jesus' feet and say, "I
   believe that You can save me, and I trust You to be my Savior." If He
   does not save you--if He cannot do so--you have at least made the
   trial. But I beseech you to listen to this text--do not close your ears
   or your heart to its message--"Behold, behold, behold, the Lord's hand
   is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither His ears heavy, that
   they cannot hear."

   This passage proves that the power to save remains unimpaired with God.
   Just as of old He forgave great sinners through the atoning Sacrifice
   of His well-beloved Son, so is He able to forgive great sinners now! He
   forgave the dying thief and He can forgive you! All manner of sin and
   of blasphemy have been forgiven of men and all manner of sin and of
   blasphemy can be forgiven of you. Though you had spent a lifetime in
   drunkenness, or unchastity, or dishonesty, or any other form of evil,
   though you should have grown gray in the service of sin and Satan--

   "There is a fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins And
   sinners, plunged beneath that flood, still, still--

   Lose all their guilty stains!"

   There is the same power with God to forgive sin as there used to be,
   for the blood of Jesus is as powerful to cleanse as it ever was!

   Note, also, that there is the same power of the Holy Spirit to change
   your nature as there ever was. He who turned Saul of Tarsus from an
   enemy into an Apostle can do the same with you. Of old, conversion was
   likened to the raising of the dead and He who has quickened many a dead
   soul can quicken your dead soul, and raise you from the dead! It was
   also called a new creation--and He who made all things new in other men
   can make all things new in you!

   Look, Sirs, if you think that God cannot forgive sin, nowadays, as He
   did in the olden times, I stand here as a living witness to the
   contrary, for I know that He has pardoned me! It has always surprised
   me, but I do not think that in all my life I so much wondered at being
   a child of God as I wonder now. Thirty-seven years ago I was baptized
   into the sacred name, and I adored the Grace of God, then, but not as
   much as I do now. What I owe to that Grace, it is not possible for me
   to express. Every time I preach to you, I feel unworthy of my sacred
   office and I would gladly run from it if I dared! But woe is unto me if
   I preach not the Gospel! Yet I bear witness to this fact, that the
   Grace of God, which was able to save me, is able to save you! Here,
   give me your hand, you trembler, give me your hand! I wish that I could
   go round the galleries and down below in the area, there, and get a
   hold of your hands and say to each one of you, "My Brother, my Sister,
   the Lord can save you, He can save you! I am a witness that He can save
   you because He has saved me! His hand is not shortened, that it cannot
   save."

   But I need not speak of myself, only. If it were proper, I could ask
   hundreds, yes, thousands of persons who are present this evening, at
   this service, to stand up and bear witness that the Lord saved them and
   that they firmly believe, after what has been worked in them, that no
   case is beyond the reach of Almighty Grace! Come along with you, then,
   do not cast blame upon God, as though your not being saved was the
   result of lack of power on the part of God the Father, God the Son, or
   God the Holy Spirit, for it is not so!

   You say that it must be the lack of will, then, but it is not, for the
   Lord's willingness to hear remains the same as ever. You are called
   upon in the text to behold that His ear is not heavy, that it cannot
   hear. You know that there are none so deaf as those who will not hear
   and if God resolved not to hear your prayers, then He would be, indeed,
   the possessor of a heavy ear. But He has not resolved to refuse your
   prayer! You may be unwilling to pray, but God is not unwilling to hear!
   "If you seek Him, He will be found of you." "Seek you the Lord while He
   may be found, call you upon Him while He is near." "For everyone that
   asks, receives, and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, it
   shall be opened." If you will come in God's way, and cast yourself at
   Christ's feet, and cry for mercy for His sake, you shall have it as
   surely as there is a God in Heaven! He knows that I lie not when I
   offer to be bondsman for my Master that He will keep His promise,
   "Whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." And
   that, "whoever" must include you! Call upon His name and prove for
   yourself the truth of the promise! Perhaps someone asks the question,
   "If what you tell me is true, why is it that I, who am really hearing,
   seeking and praying am not saved?" Now I want to try and answer that
   question.

   III. Therefore, my third division will be, THE ACCUSATION PRESSED AND
   EXPLAINED.

   If you will permit me, I will call upon you as a physician might. There
   is something the matter with you and you need to know what it is. I
   shall probably have to probe a little and, perhaps, have to go pretty
   deep. But if you really desire to receive a blessing, if there is
   anything which I say that fits your case, will you kindly take it home?
   Even if it should seem very personal and should make you feel cross, I
   cannot help that. You know that good blisters are not pleasant things,
   yet they may be very necessary. I want, if I can, to find out why it is
   that you have not obtained peace with God. The clue which guides me in
   my search is in the second verse of my text, "Your iniquities have
   separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face
   from you, that He will not hear."

   Now listen. Your accusation against God may be turned against you. You
   thought that God's hand was shortened, that it could not save, but it
   is your hand that is shortened, for you have not laid hold upon Christ!
   You have not taken your sins to Him to be put away. You have not turned
   to God with full purpose of heart--you are shorthanded, but the Lord is
   not. You said that God's ear was heavy. No, no, no! It is your ear that
   is heavy. You have not heard what God the Lord has been saying to you.
   You have not been obedient to the heavenly message. All the mischief
   lies with yourself, not with God! And at the last, if you are not
   saved, the blame will not rest upon the Savior, but upon yourself. This
   is the doctrine that we preach--if a man is saved, all the honor is to
   be given to Christ--but if a man is lost, all the blame is to be laid
   upon himself! You will find all true theology summed up in these two
   short sentences--salvation is all of the Grace of God--damnation is all
   of the will of man.

   The real reason why you have not found peace, you who have sought it,
   is sin--not your sins in the abstract, for, "though your sins are as
   scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool." No sin, whatever it is, shall ruin any
   man if he shall come to Christ for mercy. Though you are black as
   Hell's midnight through iniquity, yet if you will come to Christ, He is
   ready to cleanse you. It is sin, after all, that lies at the door and
   blocks your way to the Savior.

   First, it may be unconfessed sin. Permit me to ask whether you have
   made, before God, a full and complete confession of your sin? I do not
   insist that you should go into the details of every sin--that would be
   impossible, but there must be no cloaking or attempting to hide any sin
   from God. There must be no wish to excuse yourself, or to make out that
   what might be sin in others was less sinful in you. The Romanist tries
   to get help in confession by going to his priest and the priest puts
   many questions to him to help his memory. We observe no such practice
   as that, for we believe it to be ruinous to the priest and mischievous
   to the man! But we do ask you to make confession to God, for remember
   that it is written, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
   forgive us our sins." Remember how the prodigal said, "Father, I have
   sinned against Heaven, and in your sight"? Have you said that? That is
   the beginning of the saved life--the acknowledgment of your former evil
   ways, the humble and truthful confession that you deserve the wrath of
   God on account of your sin--the putting of yourself into the dock, as
   one who pleads guilty, and who could not speak against God even if He
   took you at your word, and condemned you then and there!

   You must take that position! You must not expect pardon till you plead
   guilty! Only acknowledge your transgression and then may you lay hold
   on Christ as your Savior and believe in Him for perfect pardon! It may
   be that you have never had peace with God because you have not made a
   confession of your sin in plain, distinct terms. It is no good to mince
   matters with God--He knows all about you. Your secret sins--the sins
   your wife does not know and that no one knows but yourself--they are
   all known to Him! Go and whisper them into the great Father's ear, with
   many a tear of deep regret that you should have offended so grievously
   against Him. If you do not, unconfessed sin will be a barrier between
   your soul and God!

   But, next, sin is a very great hindrance to Grace when it is unforsaken
   sin. Some men know they are doing wrong, yet they will not stop. They
   confess sin, yet still go on with it. They are half resolved to part
   with it, but they never really do. They know that it is the right eye
   that offends, but they dare not pluck it out. They know that it is the
   right hand that offends, but they will not cut it off. They are
   dilatory about this work and they still go on in sin. I appeal to your
   own conscience, can you expect God to pardon your sin while you
   continue in it? Can you think of the blessed Son of God coming to the
   world to be a minister of sin? That heart must be wicked to an awful
   extreme which will dare to say, "God is merciful, therefore I will
   continue in sin. We are saved by faith, alone, therefore I will believe
   in Christ and go on in my sin." Why, man, you are perverting the Gospel
   of Christ to your own destruction! You are making for yourself a
   deathbed which will be very terrible, since you are finding a way to
   Hell close by that wicket gate which lets men into the road to Heaven!

   I pray you, do not desecrate the very Cross of Christ by hanging
   yourself upon it! There are some who do even that. You must forsake
   your sins if you would be saved. Christ has come to save His people
   from their sins, not in their sins. Drunkard, you cannot keep your cup
   and yet go to Heaven! I speak plainly. You who are accustomed to lie
   cannot have a lying tongue and a saved soul! If any of you cheat in
   business, do not talk to me about your faith in Christ! If you can lie
   and cheat, and act unfairly, you are of your father, the devil, and he
   will have you as surely as you live, unless you repent and turn from
   your evil ways! There is no real salvation except salvation from
   sinning, so your sin must be stopped. I put this question to any man
   here who is a hearer, and a seeker, and yet who does not find
   peace--"Is there not some sin that you have yet to abandon?" If there
   is, God help you, by His mighty Grace, to get rid of it at once!

   There may also be some sin that has been forsaken, but it is still
   loved. Sin hankered after is a great barrier to Grace. When the cow's
   calf is taken away, how she bellows after it! And there is many a man
   who has had his sin taken away from him, yet he still longs after it.
   He does not sin with his hand or his foot, but he sins with his
   heart--his soul goes a-lusting after his iniquities. Now, while it is
   so, while sin still lies in the heart, can you expect to have peace
   with God? No, you must have the evil out, not only from the house, but
   from the heart. You must have done with it, not with the hand, only,
   but with the very desire of your spirit. "Oh," you say, "that is hard
   work!" It is harder work than you can accomplish! And in order to do
   it, you must be born again. This Truth of God should drive you to
   Christ that He may give you this new life by His Holy Spirit! But, mark
   you, if it is not your desire to give up the love of sin, you will
   never find salvation while you are thus hankering after evil.

   There are some who are hindered from finding peace, I do not doubt,
   through sin of which they are not aware. "Oh," you say, "that is rather
   a puzzling statement!" Well, there is many a man who is living in sin
   without being aware that it is sin, and that may keep him back from
   finding peace with God. I have to add this, also, that many men do not
   really want to find out! There are great numbers of people who do not
   want to learn too much about their sin! You know that light breaks in
   upon us by degrees--if we sin in the dark, that sin is not so grossly
   guilty and serious as sin in the light. But if we are in that darkness
   willfully, and we do not wish to have it removed, then we shall be
   guilty, indeed! If I commit a crime and then say, "I did not know that
   I was breaking the law," the judge says, "I cannot help your ignorance;
   you broke the law and you must bear the penalty."

   But supposing I have a book at home that tells me all about the
   requirements of the law and I still say to the judge, "I did not know
   what the law forbade"? Then he would answer, "But you ought to have
   known. You have committed a double offense, as you have not studied the
   law. It was put into your house with a command that you should study it
   and you are, therefore, doubly guilty, for you have refused to pay
   sufficient respect to the law to learn what it says." I fear that some
   of you people are not conscious of your sin because you do not want to
   know it. Where ignorance is bliss, you think it folly to be wise, but
   it would not be folly to be wise unto salvation! Some of you are losing
   comfort, losing years of usefulness, losing all certainty about Heaven
   because you will not search the Scriptures and you do not desire to
   know what an evil thing it is in you which separates you and your God!
   O men and women, do not lie under such a charge as this! Say, "I will
   know the worst of my case. If I have to probe as with a lancet, I will
   find out what the mischief is. My prayer shall be, 'Lord, let me know
   the very worst of my case, that I may afterwards find that sure
   salvation which will stand the test, even, of the Day of Judgment
   itself!'"

   I would further suggest that there may be some who are really seeking
   to believe, but they do not find peace because of some sin of omission.
   Does that open a window anywhere for any of you? It is not so much that
   you are doing wrong as that you are not doing right. You are forgetting
   some positive duty and it is that which separates you and your God. I
   have had some very curious experiences which I may never tell, so that
   the persons about whom I relate them will never be known. There was one
   which happened so long ago that I may tell it without fear. A man,
   through reading my sermons, was convinced of sin. He sought the Savior,
   but he found no peace. He was a long time in darkness and, at last, it
   was suggested to him that perhaps he found no peace with God because of
   some wrongdoing that remained unforgiven. It appeared that, some years
   before, he had robbed a person who was not aware of the theft. He had
   taken a large sum of money and he could never rest till that amount had
   been returned.

   I never saw the man who had been robbed and I had to rack my brain to
   find a way by which I could return that large sum to him without giving
   him a clue as to who it was that took it. I managed the business and I
   have the receipt for the money, and I have never heard another word
   about it. And he who was in heaviness of heart is now a joyful
   Christian, as I firmly believe, though I have never seen him. The money
   he had taken from the other man lay upon his conscience and when the
   stolen sum had been restored to its rightful owner, God granted peace
   to the one who had made restitution. It may be that there is someone
   else who has something that does not belong to him. If so, let him,
   also, make restitution. If any of you have been fraudulent bankrupts,
   try to make up that twenty shillings in the pound, which you ought to
   have paid. Christ did not come into the world to let you live as a
   rogue and then, at last, sneak into Heaven. No, He would make you an
   honest man at once--and when He has done so, there will be another
   obstacle to your finding joy and peace out of the way.

   Now let us aim once more at the target--I am trying to find out why it
   is that some seeking sinners cannot find peace. Do you not think that
   some fail to find peace because they have an ugly temper? Some people
   are born with nasty tempers--they are a poor inheritance for anybody. I
   heard one say that he was sorry that he had lost his temper. I was
   uncommonly glad to hear that he had lost it, but I regretted that he
   found it, again, so soon! There are persons who are at variance with
   their mother or their father and it is very sad when husbands and wives
   are at strife with one another-- perhaps some such are listening to me
   now. You are praying, you say, and you wonder that God does not have
   mercy on you--and yet there is strife in the household! Or it may be
   that your poor girl ran away from home and if she were to come back,
   tonight, you would shut the door in her face, would you not? You are so
   good and respectable that you could not harbor your own child! Yet you
   expect God to take pity upon you, do you?

   Or you parted from your husband in a pet and you have never gone back
   to him--and you want to find peace with God. Peace with God? Get peace
   with man before you talk about finding peace with God! You brothers and
   sisters have had a quarrel, and have made up your minds that you will
   never forgive one another. O Sirs, let me be very plain with you--if
   you cannot be at peace with your fellow men, you cannot hope to be at
   peace with God! The Lord bids you leave your offering at the altar--He
   must not be insulted with it--first be reconciled to your brother, and
   then come and seek peace with your God. Malice in the heart is
   altogether inconsistent with Grace, and it must be cast out. I know two
   brothers who will not speak to one another, yet one of them professes
   to be a Christian and the other says he wants to be one. What will God
   do with both of them? I cannot tell what to do with either of them, I
   am sure! A part of salvation is to save us from an evil, hateful,
   spirit, and to make us love God and love our fellow men, also. Perhaps
   that is the reason why some of you can find no peace--because you have
   been indulging an evil temper.

   And do you not think, once more, that there are some who find no peace
   because of an intellectual sin? There are sins of intellect quite as
   surely as there are sins of ignorance. Some men know a great deal too
   much to go to Heaven--that is to say, they think that they know better
   than their Bibles and better than their God! Their dear mother, now in
   Heaven--oh, she was a poor, simple-minded creature! Their father, stern
   in his integrity--oh, he is a bigot! The preacher who proclaims the
   Gospel with all his heart and soul, and brings many to Christ--he is
   behind his times--he has no "culture." Bah! What fools! I cannot use a
   milder word to describe some of you! I only wish that the compliment I
   have thus paid you were true in the best sense, for if you were fools,
   you would enter into Heaven, but because you are so wise, you are more
   likely to miss the way! God has oftentimes chosen those who think
   nothing of themselves and are poor and needy, while the great ones who
   are proudly wise, disdain the road that lends to Paradise. Oh, be not
   too great to enter Heaven! Be converted and become as little children,
   otherwise you shall in no wise enter therein.

   I am going to close my discourse, yet I do not want to say the last
   thing that comes into my mind. I have been describing a great many
   reasons why some people do not find peace with God, but sometimes there
   are reasons that I have not mentioned. One of these is the commission
   of gross or secret sin. Oh, the things that a man who cares for the
   souls of his fellows has to see and mourn over in this world! It must
   be 15 or 16 years ago that I was called to visit a dying man. I had
   seen him, before, when he was ill and in distress of mind, and I had
   tried to bring him to the Savior and to comfort him. He attended the
   Tabernacle constantly, but I could not make out why he did not find
   rest and peace. I often tried to remove various obstacles which I
   thought were in his way, but I never found out why he had no peace
   until after he was dead. Then I understood it. I cannot tell you all
   that there was in it, it is sufficient to say that he was living in
   known sin of the saddest kind. Kind, generous, loving--all you could
   wish him to be, but, alas, there was another household and another
   family found afterwards.

   And then I understand that while he lived so, there could be no peace
   between him and God. I hardly like to say it, but I may be addressing
   somebody who is in a similar condition tonight. My dear Souls, do not
   try to live in sin and yet to be Christians! Do not pretend to hope in
   God while you are indulging secret vice--it cannot be so! You must
   either give up your sins or give up all hope of Heaven! Men and women,
   this is an evil age, full of impurity, and it behooves the minister of
   God, when he is dealing with men's souls, to speak very plainly, and I
   am forced to put the Truth of God to you thus. Nobody knows of your
   sin. You have never been found out, yet it may be that you are living
   in the constant commission of some secret sin. By the love you bear to
   your own souls and by your desire to find Christ, I beseech you to flee
   from the evil thing! Escape for your life! Flee from the wrath to come
   and then lay hold on eternal life, for there is salvation in Christ,
   there is life for a look at Him!

   But that life consists, in great measure, in being healed of sin--and
   you cannot continue a foul life and yet be washed in the Savior's
   blood! It is a contradiction in terms and a contradiction in fact. As I
   shall meet you, my Hearers, at the bar of God--and as a dying man who
   may never speak to you again, I thought that I would put this truth in
   such a way that, if I went home to bed to die, I should not have the
   blood of any of you resting upon my hands. I beseech you, by eternity,
   by Heaven, by Hell--and there is a Hell--let the smooth-tongued liars
   of this age say what they will--by Heaven, by Hell, and by your own
   immortality, fly to Christ, give up your sin and be saved by believing
   in Jesus even now! God grant it! Amen and Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH58.

   Verse 1. Cry aloud, spare not, lift up you voice like a trumpet and
   show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.
   See, Friends, how uninterested men are by nature? God's messengers must
   not only speak, they must speak very forcibly--they must speak as with
   the sound of a trumpet before men will hear them! Among the most
   uninterested of all are those who think themselves God's people, but
   who are not really and spiritually so. It is hard to reach the common
   sinner, but it is harder, still, to reach the baptized sinner, the man
   who professes to be a Christian, but who has only the name to live
   while he is spiritually dead.

   2. Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, They are
   careful to offer morning prayers--they would not go into their business
   without bending the knee to God--and they are eager and attentive
   hearers in the House of the Lord.

   2. As a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of
   their God: they ask of Me the ordinances ofjustice; they take delight
   in approaching to God. Is it not strange that men will often continue
   to take delight in the externals of religion, while they give their
   heart to their sins? Outwardly, they keep up with great regularity all
   the observances of religion, yet in heart they are far from God.

   3. Why have we fasted, say they, and then see not? Why have we
   afflicted our soul, and You take no knowledge? They could not make out
   why they did not benefit by their religiousness. They fasted, but they
   did not find themselves improved, thereby. They afflicted their souls,
   yet they did not receive pardon for their sins, and they could not make
   it out. The Lord explained the mystery.

   3. Behold, in the day of your fast, you find pleasure; and exalt your
   labors. It is very easy to abstain from eating food of a certain kind,
   yet you can make another kind of food just as palatable. And while you
   are resting, you may be compelling others to work for you. What is this
   but hypocrisy? I think it is a common saying among the Arabs and
   Egyptians, when a man is very ugly in temper, "One would think that he
   was keeping a fast," because it often happens in long fasts that men
   grow irritable. What is the good of fasting when that is the only
   result?

   4. Behold, you fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist
   of wickedness Even in their fasts, they disputed with one another! One
   said the fast should be on such a day, another would keep it on another
   day--and no doubt there are some professing Christians who are very
   zealous, mainly out of spite against other professors--they, with as
   much zeal, keep fast days or feast days the wrong way as others do the
   right way! It is a pity when this sort of party spirit is mixed up with
   the observances of religion!

   4. You shall not fast as you do this day. Some fasted in order to
   appear very religious. "Oh," people would say, "such a man must be very
   good, he fasts three times a week." That is a kind of fasting to which
   God has no respect! To feed pride while we fast with the stomach is a
   poor way of showing how holy we are.

   4, 5. To make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I
   have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his
   head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will
   you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? The mere
   appearance of sorrow, the outward garb of mortification--what is there
   in that to please the

   Lord?

   6. Is not this the fast that I have chosen? To loose the bonds of
   wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go
   free, and that you break every yoke? That is the kind of fasting which
   God cares for--when a man leaves off oppressing those who toil for him,
   when he makes their tasks lighter, when he seeks their comfort--when he
   no longer grinds them between the millstones that threaten to crush the
   life out of them.

   7. Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the
   poor that are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you
   cover him, and that you hide not yourselffrom your own flesh? For they
   are your own flesh and blood! Though they may be total strangers to
   you, yet they are men like yourself. This is the fast that God delights
   in, when men take care to look after the poor and to relieve the
   distressed. When this is done--

   8. Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your health
   shall spring forth speedily: and your righteousness shall go before
   you; the glory of the LORD shall be your reward. Do not take those
   promises out of their context! Observe that they are made to those that
   clothe the naked, feed the hungry and care for the poor. If you have
   done this, then you can ask God to fulfill this promise, but not
   otherwise. Then, when you have done this--

   9. Then shall you call, and the LORD shall answer; you shall cry, and
   He shall say, here I am. If you have cared for the needy, God will care
   for you when you are needy. Is it not His way to reward the gift of
   even a cup of cold water to one of His disciples? Has He not promised
   that He will give back into our bosoms that which we have given to
   others for His sake?

   9. If you take away from the midst of you the yoke. If you do not
   oppress anybody--

   9. The putting forth of the finger. That is, the finger pointing
   scornfully at people and the contemptuous enquiry, "Who are
   they?"--looking down upon your fellows who, perhaps, are far better
   than yourself--you must put all that away!

   9. And speaking vanity. That constant idle talk of which some are so
   fond, that utterance of falsehood which many practice--that, also, must
   be put away.

   10. And if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
   afflicted soul; then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your
   darkness shall be as the noonday. Now mind again what I said just
   now--do not go stealing and run away with this promise without noticing
   the context in which it is placed--"If you draw out your soul to the
   hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then your light shall dawn in
   darkness," but not till then!

   11. And the LORD shall guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in
   drought, and make fat your bones: and you shall be like a watered
   garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. What rich
   promises to the generous and the kind! There are some who scatter and
   yet increase, and there are others who withhold more than is meet, and
   it tends to poverty. These promises are distinctly made to those who
   care for the needy and suffering. My Brothers and Sisters, mind well
   what the Lord, here, teaches you, for these things are far better than
   fasting! Better than any outward ordinances, whatever, are real acts of
   kindness, for remember that the same God who said, "You shall love the
   Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all
   your strength, and with all your mind," made the second table of His
   Law to run thus, "and your neighbor as yourself."

   12. And they that shall be of you shall build the old waste places. You
   shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be
   called, The Repairer of the Breach, The Restorer of Paths to Dwell In.
   God's people are to seek to turn wildernesses into paradises! There is
   no part of the world so full of sorrow but the heart of the Believer
   may bring gladness to it!

   13. 14. If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your
   pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of
   the LORD, honorable; and shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, nor
   finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words: then shall you
   delight yourself in the LORD. There is no doubt that a reverent, happy,
   joyful keeping of the Sabbath ministers greatly to spiritual
   advancement. Here is the promise made to those who delight in the
   Sabbath--

   14. And I will cause you to ride upon the high places of the earth, and
   feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of the
   LORD has spoken it. God help us to be observant of the precepts of this
   chapter that its promises may be blessedly fulfilled in our experience!
   Amen.

A Special Benediction

   (No. 2412)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 12, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 12,
   1887.

   "Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that
   are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and
   called: mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied." Jude 1,2.

   THOSE were troublous times in which Jude wrote this very forcible
   Epistle. The first early days of Christianity, with all the springtime
   of the singing of birds and the blossoming of flowers had passed away.
   There had come times of trial for everyone, but worst of all were the
   troubles within the Church. Unawares, evil men had been admitted into
   membership. The human mind, always acting like leaven, had begun to
   corrupt, even, the Truth of the Gospel, so that where there had once
   been an unadulterated, unmingled preaching of the Cross of Christ,
   there had come in a savor of Gnosticism and other philosophies of the
   day. And with all the error there had also come a tendency to tone down
   the high spirituality, the deep sanctity of Christian life. So the
   children of God who truly cared for Him and walked with Him, were very
   sad at heart. I suppose that Paul had gone home to His reward. John
   still lingered and, perhaps, James and Peter, also, but when the time
   came for Peter to write his second Epistle, the day was darkening
   down--and when Jude took up his pen and wrote this short Epistle, the
   times were getting darker and darker and great foreboding of evil were
   in the hearts of God's servants--foreboding which were only removed by
   their joyous faith in Him who had gone from them and who would,
   by-and-by, come again without a sin-offering unto salvation!

   This Epistle, therefore, seems to me to fit our times, which are not
   altogether unlike those of which I have been speaking, and the Apostle
   might have been writing yesterday, so appropriate are his words to the
   evils of the present age! If Jude were living, now, he might have to
   deal with a different form of evil, but, at the bottom, it would really
   be the same evil as that of which he wrote, the same mischievous root
   of bitterness which, springing up in our days, troubles us and,
   thereby, many are defiled.

   I thought, as I read this Epistle through, that Jude seems to take the
   right view of things, namely, that the proper way of meeting evils in
   the Church is by dealing with the Church, itself--dealing with the
   truly faithful members of the Church and speaking to those who really
   are "sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and
   called"-- stirring them up to seek the highest degree of spiritual
   strength and pleading for them that mercy and peace and love may be
   multiplied to them. If you have to visit infected places, it may help
   you to ward off disease if you, yourself, are vigorous and full of
   health. The best protection against surrounding evil will be the
   cultivation of a right state of heart and life, a continual growth in
   Grace and in the knowledge of the Lord. That wind which may upset
   yonder boat with its butterfly sails, may do no mischief, whatever, to
   the boat which is well ballasted and fitted to weather the gale. Be
   yourself right--listen to the Word of Wisdom which says, "Take heed
   unto yourself, and unto the doctrine"--and when these two matters are
   as they should be, then every wind of error which blows here and there
   will but little affect you.

   Such I take it is the run of this Epistle and the opening verses are a
   fit preface thereto. I am going to speak of these two verses under
   three heads. First, here is a special man--"Jude, the servant of Jesus
   Christ, and brother of James." Next, the Epistle is written to special
   persons--"to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved
   in Jesus Christ, and called." Then, thirdly, it contains a special
   benediction--"Mercy unto you, and peace, and love be multiplied."

   I. First of all, it seems to me that the Apostle who wrote this Epistle
   was A SPECIAL MAN. Jude evidently wished to set himself apart from the
   general mass of those who were apostatizing and to make it known that
   he, himself, was strong in the faith and remaining faithful to his
   Lord.

   To me, it seems as if every word of his own title has a specialty about
   it. There is something special in his name. He begins his Epistle with
   his own name--"Jude." Among the members of a certain denomination that
   I need not name, there is a practice of using initials when they write
   a book. I never find any instance of that custom in Scripture. "G.B."
   did not write an Epistle! And neither "A.B." nor "X.Y.Z." has favored
   us with any book of Holy Scripture! Names, however, are not always
   used. We have no name at the commencement of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, for no writer in the Old or the New Testament gloried in his
   own name. Still, they were not ashamed of their names and since they
   were bound to make an open confession of their faith, it is as well
   that they used their names at the beginning of their writings.

   This Epistle was written by Jude, that is to say, by Judas, but not
   Iscariot, and herein lies the specialty of his name. This Judas was not
   the son of perdition, but a true son of God, a sincere and
   earnest-hearted Believer. Yet, when he wrote his own name down, Judas,
   which we pronounce short as, "Jude," I think that the tears must have
   come to his eyes as he remembered that other Judas--with the same name,
   yes, and by birth with the same nature. If left to himself, he might
   have proved a traitor to his Master, like the other Judas--but Grace
   had made him to differ from the man who betrayed his Lord. If it had
   been your case, or mine, I am sure that we could not have written down
   that name without reflecting upon our obligations to the Sovereign
   Grace of God which kept us from being sons of perdition!

   "There goes John Bradford but for the Grace of God," is a saying often
   quoted--and there would have gone this other Judas but for the Grace of
   God that restrained him! You remember how particular the Holy Spirit is
   that we should not mistake this Judas for Judas Iscariot, for when he
   asked of Jesus, "Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself unto
   us, and not unto the world?" the Holy Spirit records the name of the
   questioner as, "Judas, not Iscariot." No, "not Iscariot." What a mercy
   for you that though some other of your name may have fallen into gross
   sin, you have been preserved! But as you remember your own name and
   remember how often that name has been defiled by others who at first
   were your companions in your childhood, thank God that He has kept you
   from falling. Do not think of your name without thinking of that name
   which is above all names, by which your name has been rescued from the
   Stygian bog and placed in the Book of the children of God among those
   whose names are written in Heaven! So, you see, there was something
   special, even, about the name of Jude.

   There was something equally or still more special in his office.
   "Jude--Judas--the servant of Jesus Christ." Our Revised Version very
   properly puts in the margin "bondservant of Jesus Christ," and it is
   very beautiful to see how, in the original, these servants of Jesus
   Christ delighted to set forth the completeness of their service and to
   declare how perfectly they belonged to Christ. They were not servants
   that could come and go at their own pleasure, but they were
   bondservants of Jesus Christ. Though there were no free men on earth
   more truly free than they, yet these servants of Jesus Christ delighted
   in wearing chains of love which were soft as silk yet stronger than
   steel! They rejoiced to feel that they had no liberty to run away from
   Christ--their desire was to have their ear bored to the doorpost of His
   house, to be His servants through their whole lifetime and throughout
   eternity. This is what the Apostle meant when he wrote, "Jude, the
   bondservant of Jesus Christ."

   You know how persons came to be bondservants in the olden time,
   according to Jewish practice. They were bondservants by purchase. When
   anyone had bought a slave with his money, the poor man was reckoned as
   belonging to him. So, we are not our own, we were bought with a
   price--we were not redeemed with corruptible things, such as silver and
   gold, but with the precious blood of Christ--as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot. The fine gentry in the ministry of the
   present day turn up their noses at this Truth of God and say that it is
   a mercantile idea. So it is, and we are not ashamed to have it so! "You
   are bought with a price," wrote the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians, as
   if to make it clear beyond all question that it was really so! And you
   and I feel that we, too, have been bought and paid for, and that is one
   reason why we belong to Christ. We henceforth feel that we have no
   ownership rights over ourselves, yet we rejoice that we have that which
   is much more valuable, for we can, each one, say, with Thomas, "My Lord
   and my God." Henceforth we have no claim over ourselves, but give
   ourselves over to Him who has bought us with His blood, for we are His
   bondservants by purchase.

   Then there was another method by which a man became possessed of
   bondservants, that was by birth. Under the Law of God, the man born in
   the priest's house or bought with the priest's money, might eat of the
   holy things. There were some who were born under gracious influences.
   David makes mention of this when he says, in the 116th Psalm, "O Lord,
   truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of Your
   handmaid." Having a godly mother, he reckoned that he was born into the
   service of God. Even so, you and I, the twice-born, the really
   regenerate, have been born into the household of God and our
   regeneration binds us to the noble service of Him whom we call Master
   and Lord henceforth and forever! As naturally as the old nature rebels,
   the new nature obeys! And as naturally as the old Adam within us will
   have its own way, so naturally the new Adam bends to the will of
   Christ, for we possess another life than that we used to have--we have
   been born into a new world wherein dwells righteousness! Old things
   have passed away and all things have become new--and now we surrender
   our members, which once were instruments of unrighteousness--to become
   instruments of righteousness and we rejoice in being permitted to enter
   the service of our God.

   Look again at this man, Jude. He does not even call himself an Apostle.
   Paul did, because with some it was a matter of dispute as to whether he
   was an Apostle or not, and it was necessary for him to assert his right
   to the title. But Jude, having no question upon that matter, takes the
   lower-higher title--for lower and higher are one in the Kingdom of
   Christ--and calls himself, "the bondservant of Jesus Christ." My dear
   Hearer, can you, also, take that title--a bondservant of Jesus Christ?
   Let the freethinker be free to go his own way if he will--you are a
   Christ-thinker and you wish to go Christ's way! Let the man who loves
   himself and seeks to please himself, do what he will! Henceforth you
   will love your Lord and seek to please Him, for you are, by purchase
   and by birth, the bondservant of Jesus Christ! Sometimes, also, men
   became bondservants by indenture. They entered into bonds of servitude
   for a set time and you and I have freely surrendered ourselves to
   Christ. We have entered into a covenant that we will be His forever.
   Paul wrote as if he had been branded with Christ's mark and I doubt not
   that Jude might have done the same. "From henceforth," says Paul, "let
   no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
   He belonged undoubtedly, irrevocably, eternally, to the Lord Jesus
   Christ and he gloried in that fact! Dear Friends, will you not, also,
   glory in this if it is true of you?

   Then Jude added another part of his title showing that he was special
   in his relation-- "and brother of James." This expression seems to me
   to place Jude in a very pleasant light. He felt as if he was an
   especially favored person because he had for a brother that famous
   servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, James the Less, known among the Jews
   of old as James the Just, who had a reputation, even among the outside
   world for the great holiness of his life. This man was Jude's brother.
   Christianity teaches us to value brotherhood and we highly esteem those
   with whom we are joined in relationship, especially in the
   relationships which are of Grace. I like that any man should feel glad
   of his brother, thankful for his brother, and I am glad that Jude, when
   under Divine Inspiration, does not forget to say that he was, "the
   brother of James."

   Some of us owe a great deal to our brothers and all of you have reason
   to thank God that you are the son of such an one, or that you are the
   father of such an one, or the sister of such an one, or the brother of
   such an one. There is a special mercy, probably, in your domestic
   position, and if there is, do not cease to praise God that He has given
   you to be associated in life with those who are associated with Him!
   May our children be His children! May our friends be His friends! May
   our brothers be our Brothers in Christ!

   II. Now, secondly, let us think of THE SPECIAL PEOPLE to whom Jude
   wrote this Epistle. In this instance, the marginal reading of the
   Revised Version is, I doubt not, the more correct translation--"To them
   that are beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ, being
   called." I shall take that as the best version, believing it to be
   strictly accurate.

   The special persons to whom Jude wrote were, first, beloved and
   sanctified--"To them that are beloved in God the Father." O child of
   God, in times of darkness and of doubt, above all others, cling to the
   faith once delivered to the saints, because, according to it, you are
   beloved in God the Father, or, as our Authorized Version puts it,
   "Sanctified by God the Father," which means that, by reason of His
   eternal love to you, He set you apart unto Himself. To His spiritual
   Israel the Lord still says, "You only have I known of all the families
   of the earth." "They shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, in that day
   when I make up My jewels." Before the earth was, or sun or moon or
   stars began to shine, the prescient eye of God was fixed on His beloved
   and He sanctified them unto Himself, "for the Lord's portion is His
   people; Jacob is the lot of His inheritance."

   And because He had thus set them apart unto Himself, in fullness of
   time He redeemed them unto Himself, redeemed them from among men.
   "Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it," and in consequence
   of that love of His, He determined that those whom He had redeemed
   should be the instruments of His gracious working among the sons of
   men. They were to be vessels meet for the Master's use! They were to be
   the lamps in which His Light should be carried, the salt by which His
   preserving power should be made manifest amidst the putrefaction of the
   world! He set them apart for Himself and His service according to those
   ancient words, "This people have I formed for Myself; they shall show
   forth My praise."

   Out of this love and this separation there came a sanctification of
   another kind, namely, that of cleansing, for we were heirs of wrath
   even as others, polluted like others, but the Spirit of God fulfils the
   Divine purpose of separation-- brings us out from the world, even as He
   brought Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees--and puts us in a separate path
   that we may be sojourners with God as all our fathers were. Then He
   washes us in the precious blood and in that water which flowed with the
   blood from the side of Jesus, that mystic Fountain opened on Calvary
   for the sin and uncleanness of the house of David and the inhabitants
   of Jerusalem.

   This is what is meant by being, "sanctified by God the Father." If you
   take the other translation, "beloved in God the Father," it comes to
   the same point, for love has a separating influence upon its object. If
   the love of a man is fixed upon one woman, he calls her his bride and
   he looks upon her as different from all other women on the face of the
   earth. She is always in his thoughts and in his heart, and her praise
   is often on his lips. He lives for her. Even so has God taken unto
   Himself a people who are His, alone.

   In addition to being beloved and sanctified, they are also "preserved
   in Christ Jesus." This is a very sweet expression and conveys a very
   true meaning, but the exact translation is, "kept for Jesus Christ." To
   my mind, this is a most delightful Truth of God--it makes my eyes
   sparkle to think of our being kept for Jesus Christ as jewels that He,
   alone, must wear. "A garden enclosed is My sister, My spouse; a spring
   shut up, a fountain sealed." "Kept for Jesus Christ." I wish that we
   all carried out this Divine purpose. What have I to do with idols? I am
   kept for Jesus Christ! What have I to do with seeking the things of
   this world? I am kept for Jesus Christ! What have I to do with living
   to myself, or to win the applause of men? What have I to do with the
   judgments of those who would be thought wise? What have we to do with
   anything but this--"Kept for Jesus Christ"? Our heart should be a cup
   from which no lip but His shall drink, a chalice consecrated to Him who
   has given Himself for us. Therefore let us have no eyes but for Jesus,
   no ears but for Jesus, no tongue but for Jesus--let us be always, only,
   all for Him!

   "Kept for Jesus Christ." You must not touch that treasure--it is set
   apart for the King! You must not meddle with that man, you must not
   seek to engross the love of that woman--they are kept for Jesus Christ.
   It is to such people that Jude writes his Epistle. Others may be filthy
   dreamers, but these people are kept for Jesus Christ! Some may be
   wandering stars or trees plucked up by the roots, but these people are
   kept for Jesus Christ--kept by Him, kept in Him--but especially kept
   for Him. May the meaning of this precious Word of God be written upon
   all your hearts, beloved in Christ!

   Then Jude adds, "and called." Do you not see the specialty running
   through all this description? Those who were beloved, sanctified and
   preserved, were also called! There is a call in the Gospel which comes
   to all men to whom it is proclaimed, yet all men are not "called" in
   the sense meant here. Brother, do you remember that day when you were
   called? The Gospel had called you many times and, up to that time, it
   had fallen upon deaf ears. But that day you were called! Just as
   Lazarus came forth out of the grave because he was called by Christ, so
   was it with you. You had been lying asleep, wrapped in the arms of
   sin--no, like Lazarus, you were actually dead--but that day there came
   a voice to you out of the excellent Glory! It was not a voice that you
   heard with the ears but, better than that, you heard it in your very
   soul and it was as clear a call from Christ to you as when He called
   out of Heaven to Saul of Tarsus, and said, "Saul, Saul, why do you
   persecute Me?"

   I remember distinctly when the Lord first called me and I recollect it
   all the better because He has called me many times, since, for that
   blessed call continues and is often repeated! He called us, first, from
   death to life, then from darkness to light, then from a lesser light to
   a brighter one--and He has called us to go up, step by step! Not even
   the angels go up Jacob's ladder with a flight--they ascend it step by
   step--and every day and all the day there is a call that comes to some
   of us, "Friend, come up higher." When we are half inclined to sit down
   on the step of life and admire the golden way up which we have, up to
   now, ascended, we hear a voice that says to us, "Higher"--and there is
   our gracious God at the top of the ladder, still beckoning us to
   ascend, and saying to us, again and again, "Seek you My face," and
   making us respond, "Your face, Lord, will we seek."

   Those who are the beloved of the Lord are called. They have heard a
   voice which worldlings have not heard. They have seen a face which the
   blind men of this world have never seen. They have touched a hand and a
   mystic hand has touched them, which those dead ones who still lie in
   the Wicked One have never felt. They are the called--they are called by
   Christ to come out from among the ungodly, to be separate from them, to
   follow Him and to keep following Him till, at last, He bids them enter
   into His Glory to be with Him forever!

   O Beloved, the blessings of the Gospel belong to men and women such as
   these, who have been set apart by Divine Love, who have been held apart
   and consecrated to Christ and who have been taken apart by effectual
   calling and so made to dwell apart to the glory of Christ, alone, and
   for His use only! Shall any Belshazzar drink out of these golden cups?
   God forbid! Shall Satan come and take away these crown jewels of the
   Prince and bedeck himself with them? God forbid! When I see professedly
   Christian men seeking worldly amusements and worldly honors, and thus
   giving themselves over to Belial, what can I think or say of them? God
   grant that it may not be so with any of us, but may we be "kept by the
   power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the
   last time"!

   III. Now I must close by noticing, with brevity, A SPECIAL BENEDICTION
   which Jude wished to these people, and this is to be the very pith and
   point of my sermon. It is, dear Friends, my special desire and prayer
   to God for all who are separated unto Him, that mercy, peace and love
   may be multiplied unto them.

   Beloved, may you have mercy! You will always need it, for even a saint
   is still a sinner. May you have the mercy that will continue to forgive
   your sin, the mercy that will continue to wash your feet from the
   defilement of the way! May you have the mercies of Providence that will
   supply your need, the mercies that will sustain you under trial, the
   mercies that will lead you on from strength to strength! May you have
   much mercy, for you will need it and, blessed be God, "He delights in
   mercy."

   Then, says the Apostle, he wishes that we may have peace. Oh, may you
   have it! The man who is at perfect peace with God, who is at perfect
   peace with his own conscience, who is at peace with all his fellow men,
   who especially cultivates peace by behaving himself aright in the
   household of God--this is the man who is strong in the midst of unrest
   and turmoil! This is the man who will stand firm when others flinch,
   for he can say, "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will
   sing and give praise." May you have this peace, Beloved!

   Jude next wishes that we may have love. That is to say, first, a sense
   of the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit, a
   ravishing realization that God loves us with that everlasting love
   which knows no measure, nor change, nor end. May your heart dance at
   the very thought of the infinite love of God which He displays towards
   you! And then may you have love towards men, loving your neighbor as
   yourself with that compassionate love which is pictured in the parable
   of the Samaritan, that love which does not say, "Be you warmed and be
   you filled," but which proves itself to be real by deeds of charity and
   acts of kindness! May you abound in love to God's people. May your love
   be exceedingly abundant to those who are your Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ, whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life! I wish,
   dear Friends, that you and I could be suffused with love. One said of
   Basil that he was a pillar of light--I do not so much care for that
   comparison as to be a pillar of love. Look at holy John next to his
   Master, surely, and chiefly so because he abounded in love.

   The benediction of the Apostle is this--that this mercy, peace, and
   love may be multiplied to you. Is not that a beautiful word,
   "multiplied"?--not merely increased, but multiplied! You know what it
   is to increase--you add one to two, that is three--but when you
   multiply, you say, "Three times three, that is nine." Multiplying is a
   quick way of growing! Oh, that you had all these blessings
   multiplied--that, if you have had mercy, you might have ten times as
   much mercy-- that, if you have had peace, you might have a deeper,
   fuller, richer, more abiding peace, multiplied peace, peace upon peace,
   "the peace of God, which passes all understanding"--and that, if you
   have had love, your love might be multiplied, squared, cubed! May the
   biggest figures that can be found multiply your love, for never did any
   man, yet, have too much love to God, or too much of the right kind of
   love to his fellow men! May the Lord make us to grow in Grace, to be
   filled with Grace, to have these three Graces multiplied unto us!

   Now I come back to where I began. It was a dark time when Jude wrote
   this Epistle, but instead of saying to the Christian people, "You see
   that all these people have gone astray, the cause is in danger--go
   forth and fight with them"--he says, "mercy, and peace, and love, be
   multiplied unto you." The Graces of Christians will be the defeat of
   the enemy! If you need to improve a dark night, give us brighter stars,
   and if we need to enlighten a Dark Age, let us have brighter
   Christians! If there is mischief abroad in the world, the fault, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, is, to a great extent, in ourselves. If we lived
   wholly to God, people would better know what Christians are! I believe
   that the short way to the conversion of sinners is the sanctification
   of saints. If we had more faith, we would preach better. If we had more
   believing prayer, we would see more souls converted. If we lived nearer
   to God, it would be better for the far-off ones. Is it not written that
   when a man receives this Water of Life into himself it, "shall be in
   him a well of water springing up into everlasting life" and, "out of
   his belly shall flow rivers of living water"? God make you to be such
   reservoirs of Grace!

   I have not spoken hardly a word to the unconverted, you see, because I
   want you professors so to live that your lives shall preach sermons. It
   is all very well to preach with the mouth, but the best sermons in the
   world are preached with the legs, with the life, by the walk and
   conversation of God's people! If there is piety at home, if there is
   uprightness in business, if there is a burning zeal for God in your
   common conversation, then the ungodly will say, "What does this mean?"
   And they will want to know more about it. How earnestly I wish that
   every person here who cannot be described as, "Kept for Jesus Christ,"
   might long that it were so with him, and before he goes to bed,
   tonight, might pray that he may belong to Christ! Then, giving himself
   up to Christ by faith, he may, this very night, know that sweet peace
   of which I spoke just now. So may it be with you all, for the Lord
   Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: THE EPISTLE OF JUDE.

   Verses 1, 2. Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James,
   to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus
   Christ, and called: mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
   Our holy faith breeds in us the best wishes for others. As we desire to
   find mercy, ourselves, so do we long that others, also, should find
   mercy and, as we rejoice in the peace and love which the Holy Spirit
   works in us, we desire that others may partake of the same spiritual
   benefits. Hence the Apostles usually begin their Epistles with these
   good wishes which are not mere wishes, but earnest prayers and Inspired
   benedictions. May we breathe such petitions wherever we go! Let us wish
   no man any ill, even in the most exciting and trying times, and under
   the greatest provocation, but let us still breathe out this prayer,
   "Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied."

   3. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
   salvation, it was necessary for me to write unto you, and exhort you
   that you should earnestly contend for the faith, which was once
   delivered unto the saints. These godly men, though they wrote under
   Divine Inspiration, yet stirred themselves up that they might be in a
   right condition of mind and heart. Even though the pen does not, by
   itself, write, yet it is well that it is not corroded, lest it answer
   not to the hand that uses it. So Jude says, "I gave all diligence to
   write unto you." All the diligence of Jude, by itself, could not have
   written this Epistle! Still, while depending upon Divine guidance, he
   was no mere passive agent--he gave all diligence to the accomplishment
   of his task. Jude wrote of "the common salvation," for there is but
   one. He was writing a general Epistle, a catholic Epistle, to all sorts
   of persons all over the world and he, therefore, wrote of "the common
   salvation." There is but one salvation--there cannot be another. There
   are some who trouble us, as some troubled the Christians in the
   Apostles' day, by preaching "another Gospel, which is not another," but
   there is only one salvation. "It was necessary," says the Apostle, "for
   me to write unto you." And oh, how necessary it still is to preach the
   Gospel and to warn men against defections from it! Jude continues, "It
   was necessary for me to write unto you, and exhort you that you should
   earnestly contend for the faith which was once for all" (that is the
   correct rendering) "delivered to the saints." The faith is not a
   growth. It is not an evolution. It was once for all delivered to the
   saints and the great business of the saints, the holy, the saintly
   among men, is to defend, if necessary with their lives, the faith once
   delivered unto them! We are put in trust with the Gospel, we are
   trustees of a Divine deposit of invaluable Truth. And we must be true
   to our trust at all costs. It was necessary for Jude to write as he
   did, for he had further to say--

   4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
   ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the Grace of our
   God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord
   Jesus Christ. These are two vital points in which many have
   erred--either separating holiness of life from orthodoxy of belief--or
   denying the Divinity and the supremacy of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   Nothing could more discredit the Gospel than the first error, that of
   turning the Grace of God into lasciviousness. And nothing could more
   injure the Gospel than the second error, that of "denying the only Lord
   God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."

   5. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this,
   how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt,
   afterward destroyed them that believed not. So you may get in among the
   spiritual children of Israel, you may share their privileges, you may
   sing the Red Sea song of triumph and yet, after all, if there is not
   real living faith within your soul, God will as surely destroy you as
   He destroyed the unbelieving Israelites! Those myriads of graves in the
   wilderness are as sure a token of God's hatred of sin as the drowning
   of Pharaoh's chariots and horsemen in the Red Sea! Beware, then, of
   having a form of faith which does not purify your lives, a profession
   of belief in Christ which allows you to live in sin with impunity, for
   if you have this, however near you may seem to be to the people of God,
   even if you are counted in with them, yet God will not reckon you as
   His, for He is the same Lord who "afterward destroyed them that
   believed not."

   6. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
   habitation, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
   the judgment of the great day. The angels--think of how high they stood
   in their first estate! If sin could drag an angel from the skies, it
   may well pluck a minister from the pulpit, a deacon from the Communion
   Table, a Church member out of the midst of his Brothers and Sisters! It
   is only perseverance in holiness which is the token of eternal
   salvation! If we forsake the Lord and turn back to our former evil
   ways, it will be the evidence that we never really believed in Christ
   and that there was no true work of Grace in our hearts.

   7. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like
   manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
   flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
   fire. Whatever the new gods, newly come up, that some preach, nowadays,
   may be or may not be, "our God is a consuming fire," our God is one who
   takes vengeance upon iniquity and who will by no means spare the
   guilty! He is as terribly just as He is Divinely gracious--let us bow
   before Him.

   8. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
   dominion, and speak evil of dignities. What a strange thing it is that
   such evils should spring up in the nominal Church of God! I suppose
   that out of the professing Church, there have come more monstrous evils
   than have been nursed in the world, itself! Why, even in these days, we
   have had those who have professed perfection, who have given themselves
   over to abominable evils and who have even taught them as a part of
   their perfection! Ah, me! To what depths of infamy will not men go!
   Under the very guise of holiness, the most loathsome iniquity has been
   practiced. Unless the Grace of God prevents, that which is best rots
   into that which is worst. You could not make a devil except with an
   angel for the raw material--a Judas Iscariot could only be produced out
   of an Apostle of Jesus Christ--and it was into the nominal Church of
   God that these filthy dreamers of whom Jude wrote had come. They were
   also, according to the Apostle, those who "despise dominion, and speak
   evil of dignities," those who quibble at everything that is right and
   good, and seek to pull down everything that comes to them with
   authority, especially everything that is of Divine authority.

   9. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil, when he
   disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing
   accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you. I do not know when that
   happened, yet I believe it, because it is here. When we are called to
   dispute--whether it is about the Law of God, which might be regarded as
   the body of Moses, or about the Gospel, which is the body of
   Christ--let us use no railing accusations, for the wrath of man works
   not the righteousness of God. Let us be satisfied with hard arguments
   and soft words--and when we feel that our own rebuke will be useless,
   let us simply say, "The Lord rebuke you."

   10. But these speak evil of those things which they know not. Very
   generally it is so--those who revile Holy Scripture are usually persons
   who have not read the Bible. They "speak evil of those things which
   they know not."

   10-12. But what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
   they corrupt themselves. Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way
   of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and
   perished in the gainsaying of Korah. These are spots in your feasts of
   charity. You seem to be sailing smoothly along over the placid waters,
   but these men are like hidden rocks--that is the expression used by the
   Apostle rather than, "spots."

   12. When they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear. At the
   love feasts in the Apostles' day, these ungodly men feasted without
   fear, just as some do at the Communion Table now. The absence of holy
   fear is a damning mark in the souls of unholy professors! That religion
   which has no awe in it--which never makes us tremble before the Most
   High--is not the religion of genuine faith, for there is a fear which
   even perfect love casts not out, but it rather increases and deepens
   that holy fear which is the very essence of true piety.

   12, 13. Clouds they are without water, carried about by winds; trees
   whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the
   roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
   stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. Such were
   in the professing Church in Jude's time, so we must not be surprised if
   we meet with men like them in the nominal Church today!

   14, 15. And Enoch, also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
   saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to
   execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among
   them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and
   of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against
   Him. When Enoch thus prophesied, we do not know. That he did so was
   revealed to Jude and he, here, tells us of it. It was profitable for us
   that so pointed and plain a testimony of Enoch should not be lost.

   16-18. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;
   and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in
   admiration because of advantage. But, Beloved, remember the words which
   were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; how that
   they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk
   after their own ungodly lusts. Jude gives a summary of warnings uttered
   by Paul, Peter and James.

   19. These are they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
   Spirit. They know nothing of the Divine Life and of that Divine Spirit
   who dwells in the bodies of the saints as in a holy temple.

   20. But you, Beloved, building--Is this the way, then, to prevent our
   falling into sin? Yes. To prevent doing wrong, do right--"You, Beloved,
   building"--doing good, substantial, solid work, building--

   20. Up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit!
   He has told us about the one Foundation, now he bids us build
   thereon--"Building up yourselves on your most holy faith." "Praying."
   That is the next thing. There is no preservation like that which is
   given by God in response to believing prayer. "Praying in the Holy
   Spirit." There is a kind of praying which is without the Holy
   Spirit--and it speeds not. There is a praying which is the breath of
   God in man, returning from where it came--this will keep us from
   falling and bring us untold blessings

   21. Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our
   Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. While you thus carefully watch
   over yourselves, have great love, also, to others, and seek to bless
   them, especially your fellow Church members.

   22. And of some have compassion, making a difference. They may all,
   apparently, sin in much the same way, but there may be circumstances
   that make a difference between them. There may not be the same
   willfulness, or the same continuance in the sin in some as there is in
   others--there may be, in some cases, greater temptation and, therefore,
   more excuse for them. "Of some have compassion, making a difference."

   23. And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating
   even the garment spotted by the flesh. Loving the sinners, but hating
   their sin.

   24. 25. Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
   present you faultless before the Presence of His Glory with exceeding
   joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion
   and power, both now and forever. Amen.

   The Lord bless the reading of His Word to our profit! Amen.

Despised Light Withdrawn

   (No. 2413)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 19, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   15, 1887.

   "While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the
   children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide
   Himself from them." John 12:36.

   OUR Savior was very gentle with those who had real difficulties. He
   would argue with them over and over again. He would state a Truth of
   God, and re-state it. He would cast it into the form of a parable, or
   He would condense it into a sentence comparable to a proverb, or He
   would enlarge and expand it, for He was gentle with seeking souls as a
   nurse is with her child. I do not believe that there is any real
   difficulty in the hearts of those of you who are sincerely seeking
   Jesus that He will despise. He will not quench the smoking flax, nor
   break the bruised reed and, therefore, come to Him with your doubts and
   your anxieties, believing that His tender heart so loves you and so
   desires your good, that He will sit at your feet that He may induce you
   to sit at His feet--He will come down to your level that He may lift
   you up to His level!

   I notice, however, that, while it is true that our gracious Master was
   very gentle and patient with those who had real difficulties, yet He
   did not always answer everybody's objection. When the difficulty was
   raised for the sake of questioning and disputing, when it was mere
   quibbling, when the enquirers were not in earnest and did not really
   wish to know the Truth of God, He often declined to answer them. My
   Master has no desire to be merely victor in a debate--He did not come
   into the world to fight a battle of logic just for the sake of winning
   it. It is you and your salvation that He is seeking!

   So was it in the case of these Jews--when they came with fresh
   objections, saying, "Who is this Son of Man?" our Lord, instead of
   replying to them, exhorted them to believe and walk in the light while
   they had it. He assumed that He was the Light--He took that as a thing
   which had been proven--He did not go over that ground, again, but He
   let the quibblers know that He claimed to be the Light of Life, the
   Light of God whereby men can come to God. And He pressed them to cease
   from questioning and to begin to practice real and true dealing with
   Himself. "While you have light," He said, "believe in the light, that
   you may be the children of light."

   I am not going, on this occasion, to attempt to meet any difficulties,
   or to answer any questions. The most of you have no difficulties about
   the way of salvation and many whom I address, here, have done with
   asking questions about Christ. The point is, how to come to a practical
   decision. Spirit of the Living God, make this the day and this the hour
   when many shall believe in the great Light of God, and shall be made
   the children of Light once and for all!

   I. First of all, I shall call your attention to a very solemn matter
   which may be described as THE THREATENED END TO A TIME OF
   PRIVILEGE--"while you have the light." You have no freehold possession
   of it. You have the light, but the time of light will come to an end.
   Observe the 35th verse, "Yet a little while is the light with you." You
   have it at present, but it will soon be gone from you. Take heed lest
   it be gone before you have used it, for when it has once been
   withdrawn, darkness will come upon you and, "He that walks in darkness
   knows not where he goes."

   Now what was this light of which our Lord thus spoke? To the Jews, it
   was the light of the Presence of Christ. It was a great privilege,
   indeed, for the people living in that age and in that country to have
   the Son of God among them bodily. John tells us that there were some
   few who beheld His Glory, "the Glory as of the only begotten of the
   Father, full of Grace and Truth," but the vast multitude were so
   blinded that, with God, Himself, in their midst in the Person of His
   Son, Jesus Christ, they did not perceive who the illustrious Stranger
   was! He came and He went away, again, and they knew not who it was that
   they had rejected, "for," as Paul said in writing to the Corinthians,
   "had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory."
   That was the Light of God that the Jews had--and which they lost.

   Christ has never personally come to you, dear Friends, in the flesh,
   but the light of His Gospel is still with you, and in a sense, that is
   His Presence, for Jesus is the very Life of the Gospel. There is also a
   light that comes to some men, I might even say in human form, for there
   are some ministers whom God specially appoints as His representatives
   to bless others. I cannot help looking back in history to such men as
   Whitefield and Wesley and their companions in that great revival
   period. It was a time of bright light while they were among the sons of
   men! They flew like flaming seraphs over this land, leaving a trail of
   light behind them which banished much of the darkness in which England
   had been shrouded. It was a great privilege to have heard those men
   and, when they were gone, to a large extent, and to many people, the
   Light of God went with them." There are some preachers still on the
   earth whom God blesses very greatly in the conversion of souls, men
   whom you cannot hear without being profited in your souls.

   Without exalting anybody or depreciating anybody, it is a fact that
   there are some preachers who do not touch your heart and do not stir
   your spirit--they may be very useful to others and useful in other
   directions--but they are not of service to you. On the other hand,
   there are those whom God does bless to your soul and if you find
   anywhere, in this Tabernacle, or in any other House of Prayer where
   Christ is preached, a voice that really moves you, it is, so to speak,
   a manifestation of the Light of God to you. Do not, I beseech you, play
   with it, or trifle with it, for whoever the preacher may be, however
   humble the instrumentality, if it is instrumentality that is adapted to
   your case, it should be honored in your conscience and it should be
   highly regarded in your heart! That light may readily enough be
   quenched. The preacher and his hearers may be separated. He may be
   taken from you, or you may be taken from him. In either case, it may be
   a very sorrowful experience for you to have to look back upon all you
   heard and saw in those days when there was an instrumentality exactly
   suited to your case and yet you refused to be moved by it.

   We have always with us the Gospel of Jesus Christ that you can read in
   this Book whenever you will, but the Holy Spirit must go with the
   Gospel to make it the power of God unto salvation! You cannot see the
   Light that is in the Word unless the Holy Spirit reveals it to you.
   Some of you have been under the influence of the Holy Spirit in some
   measure and degree. There have been times when you have seen sin and
   have stood aghast at it, when you have seen the Savior, and have
   admired His blood and righteousness. There have been times when you
   have been strangely inclined to come away from yourself and your sin,
   and to come to Jesus and be saved, You remember those powerful
   drawings, those inward strivings. Remember that this work of the Holy
   Spirit is but for a time, it lasts not forever. Those solemn words are
   still true, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man." A day may
   come when the same preaching that now greatly stirs you, will have no
   influence over you--and when the Spirit of God, Himself, will seem to
   be entirely absent, both from the means of Grace and from the Bible
   when you read it. Therefore I put before you this serious
   consideration, that you are at present favored with the Light of God,
   but you are only favored with it for a certain term.

   Do not reckon upon always having it, for the Light may be removed from
   you. My dear Hearer, the day may come when you will have to go away
   from this country and be found far off in the bush of Australia, or the
   backwoods of America. Or you may even, in this country, be located
   where you will not be able to hear the Gospel, for what you will hear
   will not be the Gospel, and you will be obliged to confess that it is
   not! Therefore, while you have the Light of God, remember that it is a
   favorable season for your decision for Christ. The day may come, as I
   said before, when the voice that has thrilled you, again and again, and
   that wakes the echoes of your soul's most secret chambers, shall be
   silent in death. The time may come when, although your minister and
   you, yourself, are still left in the same place, yet, so far as you are
   concerned, the Holy Spirit will be gone, and so the Light will have
   departed from you.

   Take heed, I beseech you, lest it really be so, and use the Light while
   you have it. It may, perhaps, seem to some of you that I am raising a
   needless alarm, but, indeed, it is not so. I do not think that, for
   many a day, I have come to this platform to speak to you without being
   informed, during the day, of some one or two who have passed into
   eternity out of this congregation. Years ago the bulk of us, as Church
   members, were young, and we lost comparatively few by the stroke of
   death. But, as it is with the pastor, so is it with the people--we are
   all getting older. We have entered middle life, the great mass of us,
   and, consequently, our mortality is largely increasing--and every time
   we meet we may be positively certain that we shall never, all of us,
   meet again here!

   Between this Sabbath and next Sabbath some in the ranks of our
   membership will have passed into Heaven--and some out of our
   congregation will have been called to stand before God. I feel,
   therefore, like the guard of a train that is just ready to start. The
   time is up for us to be off and the guard's whistle has been blown, but
   there is somebody who wants to talk to me about politics, or there is
   another person who wants to discuss a theological difficulty, and I
   feel bound to say, "Sir, the time is up. We must start at once--will
   you come on board, or must you be left behind? While the train is here
   at the platform, enter it, take your place, and journey with us to
   Zion, for now it is time for us to go! We cannot stop here forever."
   Time and tide wait for no man! Neither will God forever wait for men to
   turn unto Him and live--the hour shall come when all opportunities will
   be past--when the gate of mercy will be finally shut. You remember how
   it was with the wise virgins and the bridegroom, "they that were ready
   went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut."

   God bless that Word of warning! He can bless it, however feebly it may
   have been spoken!

   II. Now, secondly, I take you a little further into our theme. Here is
   AN ACT OF GRACE COMMENDED--"While you have the light, believe in the
   light." This believing is the most essential act of a man's life!
   Therefore our Lord said, "Believe in the light."

   First, believe that it is the true Light of God, believe the Gospel to
   be of God! Many here have proven in their own experience that it is of
   God and that, "it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that
   believes." That Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into this world and
   was made Man. That as Man He took upon Himself the sin of His people
   and suffered for us, "the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God," is
   most assuredly true! And, that in His name there is salvation, that in
   Him we have eternal life is, also, equally true. "He that believes on
   the Son has everlasting life," even now. Believe this to be true.

   "Well, I do believe it to be true," says one, "but I am not saved for
   all that." Then, next, I pray the Holy Spirit to help you to go a
   little further. Not only believe the Gospel to be of God, but believe
   Jesus Christ, Himself. There is a text that is often misquoted--I have
   many a time heard it said, "I know in whom I have believed," but Paul
   wrote, "I know whom I have believed." He had not only believed in
   Christ, but he had believed Christ! I want you, dear Friend, if you are
   sincerely seeking salvation, to believe Christ. Believe Him to be what
   He says He is--believe that everything He says is true--believe that
   He, Himself, does save, and can save, and will save you! So believe Him
   as to hand yourself over to Him and take Him to be your Savior! In a
   word, as our text says, "while you have light, believe in the light."

   It is essential, also, that you should believe for yourselves. It is no
   use for people to try to believe the Gospel for their friends or for
   their children. Believe it for yourselves! I notice that some unsaved
   persons will read with great interest accounts of conversions and even
   feel pleasure in hearing of this and that man being saved. My dear
   Friend, why not believe Christ yourself? Why not take Him to be your
   own Savior? Remember that it is true to you that, "He that believes in
   the Son has everlasting life." May you be led at this moment to make it
   true to yourself! You stand in a banqueting-hall tonight--the tables
   are delightfully spread with every kind of food that your hunger can
   crave and every drink that is suitable to quench your thirst--you have
   been up and down those table--and admired the generosity of Him that
   furnished them so liberally. And you have rejoiced as you have seen
   others sit down and feast!

   Now I want you to do this. There is the chair for you. What is next?
   Sit down at the table and begin to feast. It is you, yourself, who will
   find the Gospel true! It is your own personal participation in this
   feast that shall be to you, your joy and your salvation! You do not
   simply need a Savior--knock that little letter "a" out and put in the
   blessed pronoun, "my," and say from your heart, "my Savior!" Do not
   merely say, "I believe that there is pardon for sin"--take Christ to be
   your own Savior and then you are pardoned--your sin is gone! All that
   is said in the Word of God to sinners in general is meant for each
   sinner in particular when he comes and takes it to himself by his own
   individual faith. There is a passage in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress
   where he says--"These are the generals; come to particulars, Man." That
   is just what I want to say to you! All that you have heard, all that we
   have preached, may be put down as generals. But if it is to benefit
   you, you must come to particulars, you must personally appropriate the
   general Truth of God and say, "This is for me. This I believe. This I
   will take. This Savior is mine."

   "Still," says one, "suppose that I should take what was not mine." That
   is a supposition which every honest man might fairly suggest, but, in
   this case, so free is the Gospel that you may freely take it and there
   will be no question about whether you had a right to it. Look, there is
   a hungry dog! He rushes into a butcher's shop, jumps up, steals a piece
   of meat and runs off with it. It is hardly worth the butcher's while to
   run after him, to take it away, but if the dog has actually eaten the
   meat, then I am sure that no sensible butcher will even think of taking
   it away from him. Now, I would advise you to make a snatch at the
   Gospel and hungrily devour it by a ravenous faith--and I am sure that
   no one will ever take it away from you! Have you ever read that promise
   of our Lord, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out"? I see
   the Savior standing there and His different disciples come to Him, one
   after another, and He does not put one of them away from Him!

   At last there comes a filthy beggar, leprous as snow--the white scales
   are on his brow and men flee in terror from him! He comes right up to
   the Christ and tries to get into His arms. Will He not push Him away?
   No, for He says, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out," and
   He embraces this filthy, leprous beggar and, wonder of wonders, as He
   presses Him to His breast, the leprosy is healed, the filth is all gone
   and His rags are transformed to shining raiment! Wonders of Grace
   belong to Christ! Come along with you, then, and try Him for
   yourselves! Did He not Himself say, "While you have light, believe in
   the light"? If you dare to believe in that Light, you shall make no
   sort of mistake, for Jesus, Himself, bids you to do so!

   Very often, at the bottom of our unbelief, there lies this thought, "I
   am, after all, somebody of importance." It is the old story of Naaman
   all over again. He went to the house of Elisha, we are told, "with his
   horses and with his chariot." That equipage was a very important part
   of the real Naaman--his horses and his chariot went to show that he was
   a great man with his master and he would have Elisha to know that he
   was a great man and honorable, albeit that he was a leper. Such a great
   man, when he goes to the Prophet's door, down that narrow street in the
   city of Samaria, must still have his horses and his chariot! The
   coachman thought he never would get down that lane but Naaman said,
   "You must drive right up to the door. I must go with my horses and with
   my chariot." The man of God was indoors and Elisha knew how to treat
   the proud warrior--he did not even go out to him--he sent a message to
   him, saying, "Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall
   come, again, to you, and you shall be clean."

   Naaman thought that Elisha should have come out to him! He said, "I
   thought, he will surely come out to me; the proudest man in all Syria
   has been glad to unloose the laces of my shoes! Did I not come to the
   Prophet's door with my horses and my chariot? Yet he sent out a bit of
   a boy, or a servant girl, with a message to me! Then, besides, he tells
   me to wash! Does he think that I do not wash? I, a prince of Syria,
   need washing? And if I needed washing, must I come all the way to
   Jordan to wash in that paltry stream? No, there are Abana and Pharpar,
   back there at Damascus, the rivers of my very respectable country--may
   I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage."
   Yet you know that when he came to a proper state of mind, he did as the
   Prophet bade him--he washed seven times in Jordan and his leprosy was
   cleansed. Thus, proud sinner, obey the Gospel command, "Believe and
   live," and you, too, shall be made whole!

   III. I want you, now, to advance another step. I have almost
   anticipated this third point--"While you have light, believe in the
   light, that you may be the children of light." Here is A RESULT OF
   FAITH MENTIONED.

   They who believe in Christ receive a change of nature. They were born
   heirs of wrath, but, by Grace they become children of the Light of God.
   "You were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord," as
   soon as you have believed in Jesus Christ! This new birth, this
   regeneration, is a great puzzle to many poor sinners. One asks, "How
   can I make myself a new creature in Christ?" Of course, you can do
   nothing of the kind! This is a miracle--it is as much a work of God to
   make us children of light as it was to make light in the first place!
   Only God can work this miracle, but mark you this, there never was a
   soul, yet, that truly believed in Christ, but at the same time it
   underwent the change called the new birth or regeneration. Christians
   have often been asked about which is first, faith or regeneration,
   belief in Christ or being born again. I will tell you, when you answer
   me this question--When a wheel moves, which spoke moves first? "Oh,
   they all start together!" you say. So these other things all start
   together, whether it is the hub of the wheel, which is regeneration, or
   the spokes of the wheel, which are faith, repentance, hope, love and so
   on--when the wheel moves, it all moves at once!

   If you believe in Jesus Christ and Him crucified, in the moment that
   you believe, this great change of nature is effected in you, for faith
   has, in itself, a singularly transforming power. It is a fact in
   everyday experience that when a man comes to believe in his employer,
   he becomes, at once, a better employee. A person whom I disliked,
   because I suspected him, becomes, at once, pleasing to me as soon as I
   trust him. So, faith towards God, in itself, produces a total change of
   mind in the man who has it.

   But, beside that, there goes with faith a Divine energy which changes
   the heart of man. I have heard of an old sinner who had been in prison
   many a day, growing gray in his iniquity, who took a little child up in
   his arms, and, as he put his hand upon the boy's curly head, he said,
   "There would be some hope for me if I could become like this little
   child." Now, that is exactly what God can do for you! If you believe in
   Jesus Christ, you shall receive a new and childlike nature. There shall
   be created in you something better than what is called the primitive
   innocence of infancy--it shall be a really pure and holy life that
   shall be given to you and you shall become a new creature in Christ
   Jesus!

   Is not this very wonderful? The text says, "Believe in the light, that
   you may be the children of light." The children of light--what a
   wonderful picture that might be if I were an artist and could exercise
   the power of word painting which some have! "The children of light."
   Why, in the morning, when the sun first shines forth, those myriads of
   dew-drops, all brighter than diamonds of the first water--these are the
   children of light! And those innumerable flowers that open their cups
   and sweeten the air with their dainty perfume--these are the children
   of light! And those birds that have been slumbering away, there, during
   the night, in their hidden corners in the grove, come out and begin at
   once their charming minstrelsy, for they are the children of the light!
   I cannot tell you how many and how bright are these things in nature
   which are the children of light, but God can make us, by His Grace, to
   be like these things, only far better, children of light spiritually.

   What are the children of light spiritually? Well, I have met with some
   of them and it has been a great joy to know them, for these children of
   light have a great delight in the Truth of God. They are not afraid of
   it, they love to dive into it! As children of light they like to know,
   they wish to know, even the deep things of God. They do not shut their
   eyes to the Truth of God about eternity. They do not refuse to search
   their own hearts. They are children of the Light of God and they desire
   the Light of God to shine! They come to the Light of God that their
   hearts, their thoughts and their works may be made manifest. They
   delight to know the Truth of God--error and falsehood are loathsome to
   them--but that which is true is charming to their judgment.

   "Children of light." They are those who move in a world of knowledge.
   They have come to know what others do not know. To them the world is
   peopled with invisible beings! To them eternal things are no dreams,
   but they have become realities. Their eyes have been opened to a Light
   that shines not from the sun and they move in an atmosphere in which
   they behold things which the telescope cannot reveal. They are children
   of the Light of God who have come into a world of perception and
   discoveries to which others are strangers!

   "Children of light." I will tell you, again, how you may know them.
   They practice truth. They speak the truth. It is said that an
   ambassador is a gentleman who is sent abroad to lie for the good of his
   country. I suppose that common saying is so nearly true that we need
   not correct it. And a politician is often a gentleman who has learned
   the art of concealing his thoughts, or who expresses opinions which he
   trusts will be in accordance with those of his constituency! A child of
   God is a man who says what he believes, let the world believe it or
   not! He does not understand, "policy." He is no mariner who trims his
   sail to every shifting wind but, believing in the difference between
   right and wrong, he chooses the right and eschews the wrong, for he is
   a child of the Light of God! He has made up his mind to follow the
   right, the true, the good and the gracious at all costs. Now, that is
   what faith in Christ will do for you. It will make you, by the good
   Spirit of God, to be a child of light!

   A child of light, further, is one who exhibits the mind and character
   of God. He is not an earthworm, hiding himself away in the mold. He is
   not a rat which loves to be behind the wainscot except at nighttime--he
   is a child of light. He wears his heart upon his sleeve where birds may
   peck at it and they will do so, but that will not affect him. It is not
   for him to conceal anything--what has he to conceal? He lives in the
   sight of the eternal God and, as for how he appears in the sight of
   men, what is that to him? Such an one condemns me, but God acquits me,
   so let the other condemn if he will, what does it matter to me? Such a
   man acquits and applauds me, but if God condemns me, the acquittal of
   man is less than nothing and vanity! A child of light should be very
   bold for his Lord.

   You remember that the times were horribly dark in the days when William
   Farel lived in Switzerland and young John Calvin had written his
   weighty volumes of treatises called the Institutes. They were the
   product of his early days and he wrote in a flowing style, either in
   French or Latin, and he thought, if he wrote books and sent them forth,
   he would have done his part towards the Reformation. But Farel
   discovered this young writer and said to him, "You must take up the
   work of the Reformers and carry it on by preaching the Truth." Calvin
   replied, "I am a bookish man, I have not the courage and the strength
   to stand out in the front of the battle--that is for men like Martin
   Luther. I am a studious person and not so much a man of action."

   Farel reasoned with him and said, "You must come out and take the lead
   in this Reformation fight," and he asked him, "Are you afraid of losing
   your life?" Calvin protested that he had no such fear, he would
   willingly lay down his life for Jesus Christ if that were necessary,
   but he shrank from the tumult of controversy." Then Farel pronounced
   upon him a curse so terrible, if he did not immediately come and take
   his proper place, that John Calvin had to yield and he never doubted
   afterwards, but was always to the front, and always the bravest of the
   brave! I have often admired the noble veteran, Farel, who could not
   tolerate that this young man, with so much in him, should simply hold
   the pen and keep in the background, but threatened that the Lord would
   follow him with all the vials of His vengeance if he did not take his
   place at the post of duty. I should like now, if I could, to put my
   hand upon the shoulder of some young Brother, and call upon him to come
   out to serve his Lord. I feel myself, tonight, like an Elijah to
   you--and I charge you, Elisha, quit the cattle and betake yourself to
   this prophetic ministry! God calls you to it and woe be to you if you
   stay back from it!

   Again, a child of light is one who, by God's Grace, is bright, happy,
   restful, full of joy, life, fruitfulness. These are the children of the
   Light of God and if we believe in Christ, who is the Light of God, and
   take Him to ourselves with all our hearts, then we shall be the
   children of Light. I pray that some of you may become the children of
   Light even tonight. O God, work miracles of mercy in this house!
   Jehovah, true God, when You answer by fire, then are You known to be
   God and the priests of Baal flee away. If you will convert men by Your
   own Omnipotent Grace, they will worship and adore You. If You will not
   do this, what can my voice do? Pray, O you people of God, that He may
   bring those who have His Light to believe in the Light and to become
   the children of Light! These people to whom Christ spoke were bigoted
   persecuting Jews, yet He said, even to them, "Believe in the light,
   that you may be the children of light." Whoever may be in my
   congregation tonight--and doubtless there is a mixed medley here--there
   are none within these walls whom the power of Divine Grace cannot at
   this moment save! Our Lord Jesus Christ is as able to save the most
   abandoned as the most moral and to bring to Himself the most skeptical
   as well as the most credulous! May that miracle be worked in our midst
   by His great Grace!

   IV. My last point is, A GRIEVOUS CLOSE TO A SERMON.

   Christ Himself was the Preacher on this occasion--do you, therefore,
   infer that these people believed? Let me read to you what happened when
   the sermon was done. They gathered about that extempore pulpit from
   which Jesus had addressed them, but, all of a sudden, they could
   scarcely tell how, He was gone! They said one to another, "Where is
   He?" According to the latter part of our text, this happened at the
   close of Christ's sermon--"These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and
   did hide Himself from them." So, although He had preached as never man
   preached, though His very soul had run over at His lips in a mighty
   cascade of love, yet His hearers were not converted, but the Divine
   Preacher had to go and hide Himself from their malicious violence! The
   preacher, on this occasion, will not have to do that. No one will seek
   his life, or try to do him injury, but it is a sad reflection that the
   same result may follow as followed from Christ's own preaching. Men may
   go their way with their eyes blinded and the question of Isaiah may
   have to be repeated again and again, "Who has believed our report? And
   to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"

   Do you blame Jesus because these people rejected His testimony? Do you
   blame Jesus because He had to escape from their violence? No, no, no--a
   thousand times, no! And "in that day," in that last dread Day of
   Judgment, I trust that you will exonerate me from all blame if you are
   lost, for I have earnestly exhorted you to believe in Jesus, and in
   Jesus only! There is salvation to be had in Him--will you have it, or
   will you not? I would gladly grip your hand, to detain you, as that
   "ancient mariner," of whom Coleridge tells us in his weird poem,
   transfixed with his glittering eyes the wedding guest, and held him
   when he wanted to be gone, and I would pray you to remember that
   tonight may be the turning point, the deciding hour, of your eternal
   destiny! The scales, I see, are quivering--which way shall they turn? O
   blessed Christ, cast Your Cross in the balance and turn it, tonight,
   for the salvation of each one before You, and unto Your name shall be
   praise forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON:

   Verses 20-24. Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to
   worship at the feast. Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida
   of Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." Philip
   came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus. But
   Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man
   should be glorified. Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of
   wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies,
   it produces much grain." I think that our Savior looked upon these
   Greeks as a sort of vanguard of the great army of Gentiles who would
   come to Him as the result of His death, but He fixed His eyes upon the
   cause rather than the result, and so He began to talk about that death
   of His, and how it was that it would work such glorious results. If you
   want a corn of wheat to grow, you must put it into the ground. It must
   be resolved into its primary particles--for that is what, "to die,"
   means--and then it must spring up, again, with newness of life, or else
   it can never be multiplied. It was so with the Lord Jesus, Himself. It
   is still so with us, it is in proportion as we, ourselves, shall be
   prepared to die that we shall be prepared to give life to others.

   25. He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in
   this world shall keep it unto life eternal. To hoard your energies will
   be really to destroy them, like hoarded wheat which, in the end,
   becomes useless. But to give up your energies, to expend your life
   forces--this is to sow the wheat--and this is the way to ensure the
   harvest.

   26. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me. Do not let him invent some
   new method of service--"Let him follow Me." If you would do Christ a
   service, it cannot be by will-worship, or by any way of your own
   devising! "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me."

   26. And where l am, there shall also My servant be. "He shall be with
   Me in tribulation. He shall be with Me in hu-miliation--and he shall
   ultimately be with Me in triumph and in Glory."

   26. If anyone serves Me, him will My Father honor. Those servants of
   Christ who follow at their Master's heel and do His bidding at all
   times, are the true knights of the King who win the honors that God
   alone can give.

   27. Now is My soul troubled and what shall I say? 'Father, save Me from
   this hour?' But for this cause came I unto this hour. Often, my
   Brothers and Sisters, should we be checked in prayer if we would be as
   wise as our Lord. "What shall I say? Shall I ask to be delivered from
   sickness? Shall I ask that I may not endure the troubles which are the
   common lot of men? Shall I pray to be screened from persecution?" You
   see, I am rendering our Lord's question into our language, bringing it
   down from the lofty height of His Divine thoughts to the level of our
   poor humanity! We must often pause before we pray, and say with our
   Lord, "For this cause came I unto this hour. Have I not been brought
   here on purpose to suffer? Have I not been led to this place that I may
   glorify God by submitting to all His will?" Therefore, sometimes let us
   check ourselves in prayer lest we should ask what is not for our own
   good or for God's Glory. The next word of the Savior will give us
   liberty enough, for He went on to say--

   28. Father, glorify Your name. When we are pleading about that glorious
   name of Jehovah, we may pray with vehemence and importunity--"Father,
   whatever I do or suffer, glorify Your name."

   28, 29. Then came there a voice from Heaven, saying, I have both
   glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that
   stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel
   spoke to Him. Ah, they did not understand the voice of God, or the
   cause of the voice speaking to them. If the men of the world in our
   Savior's day did not understand the Father's voice to the
   Only-Begotten, do not expect that the men of the world, today, will
   understand the Divine voice in your heart. They will reckon that you
   are in error and that God has not spoken to you--it has only thundered.
   They will be ready to invent all kinds of stories of angels and I know
   not what, so as to get rid of the voice of God to you. But you know
   it--if you are God's children, you know His voice and you also know
   what He means when He speaks!

   30-32. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of Me, but
   for your sakes. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince
   of this world be cast out. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth,
   will draw all men unto Me. This is the sermon which has the Greeks for
   a text. They are already coming, being drawn to Christ, but when He
   dies, when He is lifted up upon the Cross, instead of losing His
   attractive power, He will have greater drawing force than ever--"I, if
   I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me."

   33, 34. This He said, signifying what death He should die. The people
   answered Him. As they were always doing, capaciously answering--not
   answering Him with sentiments that responded to His, but replying
   against Him with their caviling.

   34-41. We have heard out of the Law that Christ abides forever: and how
   can say You, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?' Who is this Son of
   Man? Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with
   you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he
   that walks in darkness knows not where he goes. While you have light,
   believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These
   things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide Himselffrom them. But
   though He had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not
   on Him: that the saying of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, which
   he spoke, 'Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm
   of the Lord been revealed?' Therefore they could not believe, because
   that Isaiah said again, 'He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their
   heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with
   their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.' These things
   said Isaiah, when he saw His Glory, and spoke of Him. It is an awful
   thing to resist the Spirit of God, for if His softening influences are
   withdrawn, the heart grows hard! If His enlightening influences are
   taken away, the eyes of the understanding are darkened! I believe there
   are many who have so long trifled with conscience and violated the best
   instincts of their nature that they are given up as those who are past
   hope. I pray God that it may not be so with any here. But it was so
   with many in the generation among which Christ labored.

   42. Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on Him.
   Christ has His secret followers in the darkest days. There are men who
   believe in Him even when the current of infidelity runs most strongly.

   42, 43. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest
   they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of
   men more than the praise of God. For which they deserved great censure!
   Yet some of them cast away their cowardice at the last, for Joseph of
   Arimathaea and Nicodemus were among those who confessed their love to
   the Crucified Christ.

   44-49. Jesus cried and said, He that believes on Me, believes not on
   Me, but on Him that sent Me. And he that sees Me sees Him that sent Me.
   I am come a Light into the world, that whoever believes on Me should
   not abide in darkness. And if any man hears My word, and believes not,
   I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the
   world. He that rejects Me, and receives not My words, has that which
   judges him--the words that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in
   the last day. For I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father which
   sent Me. He gave Me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should
   speak. Christ did not pride Himself upon being a great original
   thinker. He took His words from His Father's mouth--and the preacher of
   the Gospel is to be no inventor of new thoughts. The "thoughtful" man
   of whom we hear so much is just a man who is rebellious against God.
   The Lord's true servant is to repeat God's thoughts, not his own--to
   borrow from the Scriptures, to borrow from the teaching of the Holy
   Spirit--even as the Lord Jesus Christ did.

   50. And I know that His commandment is life everlasting: whatever I
   speak, therefore, even as the Father said unto Me, so I speak. If the
   great Head of the Church was thus only a Messenger, the Deliverer of a
   message from the Father, should not we, who at our best are such poor
   ministers of Christ, take heed to it that we, also, can say, "Even as
   the Father said unto me, so I speak"? God grant it! Amen.

The Prodigal's Climax

   (No. 2414)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 26, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 19,
   1887.

   "When he came to himself." Luke 15:17.

   THERE are different stages in the sinner's history and they are worth
   marking in the prodigal's experience. There is, first, the stage in
   which the young man sought independence from his father. The younger
   son said, "Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me." We
   know something of that state of mind and, alas, it is a very common
   one! As yet there is no open profligacy, no distinct rebellion against
   God. Religious services are attended, the father's God is held in
   reverence, but in his heart the young man desires a supposed
   liberty--he wishes to cast off from all restraint. Companions hint that
   he is too much tied to his mother's apron string. He, himself, feels
   that there may be some strange delights which he has never enjoyed and
   the curiosity of Mother Eve to taste the fruit of that tree which was
   good for food, and pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
   make one wise, comes into the young man's mind--and he wishes to reach
   out his hand and take the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good
   and Evil, that he may eat thereof. He never intends to spend his
   substance in riotous living, but he would like to have the opportunity
   of spending it as he likes. He does not mean to be a profligate, still,
   he would like to have the honor of choosing what is right on his own
   account. At any rate, he is a man, now--he feels his blushing honors
   full upon him and he wants, now, to exercise his own freedom of will
   and to feel that he, himself, is really his own master! Who, indeed, he
   asks, is Lord over him?

   Perhaps there are some to whom I am speaking who are just in such a
   state as that--if so, may the Grace of God arrest you before you go any
   further away from Him! May you feel that to be out of gear with God--to
   wish to be separated from Him and to have other interests than those of
   Him who made you--must be dangerous and probably will be fatal!
   Therefore, now, even now, may you come to yourself at this earliest
   stage of your history and also come to love and rejoice in God as the
   prodigal returned to his father!

   Very soon, however, this young man in the parable entered upon quite
   another stage. He had received his portion of goods--all that he would
   have had at his father's death he had turned into ready money--and
   there it was. It is his own and he may do what he pleases with it.
   Having already indulged his independent feeling towards his father and
   his wish to have a separate establishment altogether from him, he knew
   that he would be freer to carry out his plans if he did so right away.
   Anywhere near his father there is a check upon him--he feels that the
   influence of his home somewhat clips his wings. If he could get into a
   far country, there he would have the opportunity to develop--and all
   that evolution could do for him, he would have the opportunity of
   enjoying--so he gathers all together and goes into the far country.

   It may be that I am addressing some who have reached that stage. Now
   there is all the delirium of self-indulgence. Now it is all gaiety, "a
   short life and a merry one," forgetting the long eternity and a woeful
   one! Now the cup is full and the red wine sparkles in the bowl. As yet,
   it has not bitten you like a serpent, nor stung you like an adder, as
   it will do all too soon--just now it is the deadly sweetness that you
   taste and the exhilaration of that drugged chalice that deceives you.
   You are making haste to enjoy yourself! Sin is a dangerous joy, beloved
   all the more because of the danger, for, where there is a fearful risk,
   there is often an intense pleasure to a daring heart and you, perhaps,
   are one of that venturous band, spending your days in folly and your
   nights in righteousness.

   Before long there comes a third stage to the sinner as well as to the
   prodigal--that is when he has, "spent all." We have only a certain
   amount of spending money, after all. He who has gold without limit, yet
   has not health without limit! Or if health does not fail him in his
   sinning, yet desire fails and satiety comes in as it did with Solomon
   when he tried this way of seeking happiness. At last there is no honey
   left, there is only the sting of the bee! At last there is no sweetness
   in the cup, there is only the delirium that follows the intoxication!
   At last the meat is eaten to the bone and there is nothing good to come
   out of that bone--it contains no marrow, the teeth are broken with
   it--and the man wishes that he had never sat down to so terrible a
   feast! He has reached the stage at which the prodigal arrived when he
   had spent all. Oh, there are some who spend all their character, spend
   all their health and strength, spend all their hope, spend all their
   uprightness, spend everything that was worth having! They have spent
   all! This is another stage in the sinner's history and it is very apt
   to lead to despair, deeper sin and, sometimes, to that worst of sins
   which drives a man red-handed before the bar of his Maker to account
   for his own blood!

   It is a dreadful state to be in, for there comes at the back of it a
   terrible hunger. There is a weary labor to get something that may stay
   the spirit, a descending to the degradation of feeding swine, a
   willingness to eat of the husks that swine eat, yet an inability to do
   so! Many have felt this craving that cannot be satisfied. But, for my
   part, I am glad when "the rake's progress" has reached this point, for
   often, in the Grace of God, it is the way home for the prodigal! It is
   a roundabout way, but it is the way home for him! When men have spent
   all and poverty has followed on their reckless-ness--and sickness has
   come at the call of their vice--then it is that Omnipotent Grace has
   stepped in--and there has come another stage in the sinner's history of
   which I am now going to speak, as God may help me. That is the point
   the prodigal had reached, "when he came to himself."

   I. Then, first, A SINNER IS BESIDE HIMSELF.

   While a man is living in his sin, he is out of his mind, he is beside
   himself. I am sure that it is so. There is nothing more like madness
   than sin and it is a moot point among those who study deep problems,
   how far insanity and the tendency to sin go side by side, and
   whereabouts it is that great sin and entire loss of responsibility may
   touch each other. I do not intend to discuss that question at all, but
   I am going to say that every sinner is morally and responsibly insane
   and, therefore, in a worse condition than if he were only mentally
   insane.

   He is insane, first, because his judgment is altogether out of order.
   He makes fatal mistakes about all-important matters. He reckons a short
   time of this mortal life to be worth all his thoughts and he puts
   eternity into the background. He considers it possible for a creature
   to be at enmity against the Creator, or indifferent to Him, and yet to
   be happy! He fancies that he knows better what is right for him than
   the Law of God declares. He dreams that the everlasting Gospel, which
   cost God the life of His own Son, is scarcely worthy of his attention
   at all, and he passes it by with contempt. He has unshipped the rudder
   of his judgment and steers towards the rocks with awful
   deliberation--and seems as if he would wish to know where he can find
   the surest place to commit eternal shipwreck! His judgment is out of
   order.

   Further, his actions are those of a madman. This prodigal son, first of
   all, had interests apart from his father. He must have been mad to have
   conceived such an idea as that! For me to have interests apart from Him
   who made me and keeps me alive--for me, the creature of an hour, to
   fancy that I can have a will in opposition to the will of God, and that
   I can so live and prosper--why, I must be a fool! I must be mad to wish
   any such thing, for it is consistent with the highest reason to believe
   that he who yields himself up to Omnipotent Goodness must be in the
   track of happiness, but that he who sets himself against the Almighty
   Grace of God must certainly be kicking against the pricks to his own
   wounding and hurt! Yet this sinner does not see that it is so and the
   reason is that he is beside himself.

   Then, next, that young man went away from his home, though it was the
   best home in all the world. We can judge that from the exceeding
   tenderness and generosity of the father at the head of it and from the
   wonderful way in which all the servants had such entire sympathy with
   their master. It was a happy home--well stored with all that the son
   could need--yet he quits it to go, he knows not where, among strangers
   who did not care a straw for him and who, when they had drained his
   purse, would not give him even a penny with which to buy bread to save
   him from starving! The prodigal must have been mad to act like
   that--and for any of us to leave Him who has been the dwelling place of
   His saints in all generations, to quit the warmth and comfort of the
   Church of God which is the home ofjoy and peace--is clear insanity!
   Anyone who does this is acting against his own best interests--he is
   choosing the path of shame and sorrow, he is casting away all true
   delight--he must be mad.

   You can see that this young man is out of his mind because, when he
   gets into the far country, he begins spending his money riotously. He
   does not lay it out judiciously. He spends his money for that which is
   not bread and his labor for that which satisfies not--and that is just
   what the sinner does. If he is self-righteous, he is trying to weave a
   robe out of the worthless material of his own works. And if he is a
   voluptuary, given up to sinful indulgence, what vanity it is for him to
   hope for pleasure in the midst of sin! Should I expect to meet with
   angels in the sewers? With heavenly light in a dark mine? No, these are
   not places for such things as those, and can I rationally look for joy
   to my heart from reveling, chambering, wantonness and such conduct? If
   I do, I must be mad! Oh, if men were but rational--and they often
   wrongly suppose that they are--if they were but rational beings, they
   would see how irrational it is to sin! The most reasonable thing in the
   world is to spend life for its own true design and not to fling it away
   as though it were a pebble on the seashore.

   Further, the prodigal was a fool, he was mad, for he spent all. He did
   not even stop half-way on the road to penury, but he went on till he
   had spent all! There is no limit to those who have started in a course
   of sin. He that stays back from it, by God's Grace, may keep from it,
   but it is with sin as it is with the intoxicating cup. One said to me,
   the other day, "I can drink much, or I can drink none, but I have not
   the power to drink a little, for if I begin, I cannot stop myself, and
   may go to any length." So is it with sin, God's Grace can keep you
   abstaining from sin, but, if you begin sinning, oh, how one sin draws
   on another! One sin is the decoy or magnet for another sin, and draws
   it on, and one cannot tell, when he begins to descend this slippery
   slide, how quickly and how far he may go! Thus the prodigal spent all
   in utter recklessness and, oh, the recklessness of some young sinners
   whom I know! And, oh, the greater recklessness of some old sinners who
   seem resolved to be damned, for, having but a little remnant of life,
   left, they waste that last fragment of it in fatal delay!

   Then it was, dear Friends, when the prodigal had spent all, that he
   still further proved his madness! That would have been the time to go
   home to his father, but, apparently, that thought did not occur to him.
   "He went and joined himself to a citizen of that country," still
   overpowered by the fascination that kept him away from the one place
   where he might have been happy--and that is one of the worst proofs of
   the madness of some of you who frequent these courts, that though you
   know about the great God and His infinite mercy, and know something of
   how much you need Him and His Grace, yet you still try to get what you
   need somewhere else and do not go back to Him!

   I shall not have time to say much more upon this point, but I must
   remind you that, like sinners, the prodigal had the ways of a madman. I
   have had, at times, to deal with those whose reason has failed them,
   and I have noticed that many of them have been perfectly sane, and yet
   wise and clever, on all points except one. So is it with the inner. He
   is a famous politician, just hear him talk! He is a wonderful man of
   business--see how sharply he looks after every penny! He is very
   judicious in everything but this--he is mad on one point--he has a
   fatal monomania, for it concerns his own soul!

   A madman will often conceal his madness from those around him--so will
   a sinner hide his sin. You may talk with this man about morals and you
   may watch him very closely--yet it may be a long time before you can
   figure him out and be able to say to him, "One thing you lack."
   Perhaps, all of a sudden, you touch that weak point, and there he
   stands, fully developed before you, far gone in his insanity! He is
   right enough, elsewhere, but with regard to his soul his reason is
   gone!

   Mad people do not know that they have been mad till they are
   cured--they think that they, alone, are wise, and all the rest are
   fools. Here is another point of their resemblance to sinners, for they,
   also, think that everybody is wrong except themselves. Listen how they
   will abuse a pious wife as "a fool"! What hard words they will use
   towards a gracious daughter! How they will rail at the ministers of the
   Gospel and try to tear God's Bible to pieces! Poor mad souls, they
   think all are mad except themselves! We, with tears, pray God to
   deliver them from their delusions and to bring them to sit at the feet
   of Jesus, clothed, and in their right minds.

   Sometimes the sinner will be seen and known to be mad because he turns
   on his best friends, as madmen do. Those whom they otherwise would have
   loved the most, they reckon to be their worst enemies. So God, who is
   man's best Friend, is most despised, and Christ, who is the Friend of
   sinners, is rejected, and the most earnest Christians are often the
   most avoided or persecuted by sinners.

   Mad people sometimes, too, will rave, and then you know what dreadful
   things they will say. So is it with sinners when their fits are on
   them. I dare not speak of what they will do and what they will say.
   They often pull themselves up, afterwards, and feel ashamed to think
   that they should have gone so far. Yet it is so, for they are beside
   themselves, even as the prodigal was.

   I will not dwell longer on this sad fact because I want to speak on the
   next and brighter part of my theme.

   II. Secondly, IT IS A BLESSED THING WHEN THE SINNER COMES TO HIMSELF.
   "When he came to himself." This is the first mark of Grace working in
   the sinner as it was the first sign of hope for the prodigal.

   Sometimes, this change occurs suddenly. I was greatly charmed, this
   week, by meeting with one to whom this happened. It was an old
   fashioned sort of conversion with which I was delighted. There came
   into this building, some three months ago, a man who had not, for a
   long time, gone to any place of worship. He despised such things. He
   could swear and drink, and do worse things. He was careless, godless,
   but he had a mother who often prayed for him, and he had a brother who
   is, I believe, here, tonight, whose prayer has never ceased for him. He
   did not come here to worship--he came just to see the preacher whom his
   brother had been hearing for so many years. But, coming in, somehow he
   was no sooner in the place than he felt that he was unfit to be here,
   so he went up into the top gallery, as far back as he could, and when
   some friend beckoned him to take a seat, he felt that he could not do
   so--he must just lean against the wall at the back.

   Someone else invited him to sit down, but he would not. He felt that he
   had no right to do so. And when the preacher announced his text, [See
   Sermon #1949, Volume 33--A Sermon for the Worst Man on Earth]--"And the
   publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto
   Heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a
   sinner"--and said something like this, "You that stand farthest off in
   the Tabernacle and dare not sit down because you feel your guilt to be
   so great--you are the man to whom God has sent me, this morning--and He
   bids you come to Christ and find mercy," a miracle of love was worked!
   Then, "he came to himself," as he will tell us, soon, at the Church
   meeting when he comes forward to confess his faith. I rejoiced greatly
   when I heard of it, for in his case there is a change that everybody
   who knows him can see! He has become full of a desire after everything
   that is gracious as once he practiced everything that was bad! Now that
   is what sometimes happens and why should it not happen, again, tonight?
   Why should not some other man, or some woman, come to himself or to
   herself tonight? This is the way home--first to come to yourself--and
   then to come to your God. "He came to himself."

   On the other hand, sometimes this change is very gradual. I need not
   dwell upon that, but there are many who have their eyes opened by
   degrees. They first see men as trees walking. Afterwards, they see all
   things clearly. So long as they do but come to themselves, and come to
   the Savior, I mind not how they come! Some conversions are sudden, some
   gradual, but in every case, if it is the work of the Holy Spirit, and
   the man comes to himself, it is well.

   Now let us consider how this change happened. If you should ask me the
   outward circumstances of the prodigal's case, I would say that it took
   a great deal to bring him to himself. "Why, surely," one says, "he
   ought to have come to himself when he had spent all! He must have come
   to himself when he began to be hungry." No, it took a great deal to
   bring him to himself, and to his father--and it takes a great deal to
   bring sinners to themselves and to their God. There are some of you who
   will have to be beaten with many stripes before you will be saved. I
   heard one say, who was crushed almost to death in an accident, "If I
   had not nearly perished, I would have wholly perished." So is it with
   many sinners--if some had not lost all they had, they would have lost
   all--but, by strong winds, rough and raging, some are driven into the
   port of peace.

   The occasion of the prodigal's climax was this--he was very hungry, in
   great sorrow and he was alone. It is a grand thing if we can get people
   to be alone. There was nobody near the poor man and no sound for him to
   hear except the grunting of the hogs and their munching of those husks.
   Ah, to be alone! I wish that we had more opportunities of being alone
   in this great city, yet, perhaps, the most awful loneliness may be
   realized while walking a London street! It is a good thing for a
   sinner, sometimes, to be alone. The prodigal had nobody to drink with
   him, nobody to sport with him--he was too far gone for that. He had not
   a rag to pawn to get another pint--he must, therefore, just sit still
   without one of his old companions. They only followed him for what they
   could get out of him. As long as he could treat them, they would treat
   him well, but when he had spent all, "no man gave unto him." He was
   left without a comrade in misery he could not allay, in hunger he could
   not satisfy. He pulled that belt up another notch and made it
   tighter--but it almost seemed as if he would cut himself in two if he
   drew it any tighter! He was almost reduced to a skeleton. Emaciation
   had taken hold of him and he was ready to lie down there and die. Then
   it was that he came to himself.

   Do you know why this change occurred in the prodigal's case? I believe
   that the real reason was that his father was secretly working for him
   all the while. His state was known to his father. I am sure it was
   because the elder brother knew it and if the elder brother heard of it,
   so did the father. The elder brother may have told him, or, if not, the
   father's greater love would have a readier ear for tidings of his son
   than the elder brother had. Though the parable cannot tell us--for no
   parable is meant to teach us everything--yet it is true that our Father
   is Omnipotent and He was secretly touching the core of this young man's
   heart, and dealing with him by this wondrous surgery of famine and of
   need to make him, at last, come to himself.

   Perhaps somebody here says, "I wish I could come to myself, Sir,
   without going though all that process." Well, you have come to
   yourself, already, if you really wish that! Let me suggest to you that
   in order to prove that it is so, you should begin seriously to
   think--to think about who you are, where you are and what is to become
   of you. Take time to think, and think in an orderly, steady, serious
   manner and, if you can, jot down your thoughts. It is a wonderful help
   to some people to put down upon paper an account of their own
   condition. I believe that there were many who found the Savior one
   night when I urged them, when they went home, to write on a piece of
   paper, "Saved as a Believer in Jesus," or else, "Condemned because I
   believe not on the Son of God." Some who began to write that word,
   "condemned," have never finished it, for they found Christ, then and
   there, while seeking Him! You keep your account books, do you not? I am
   sure you do if you are in trade, unless you are going to cheat your
   creditors. You keep your business books--well, now, keep a record
   concerning your soul! Really look these matters in the face, the
   hereafter, death--which may come so suddenly--the great eternity, the
   Judgement Seat. Think about these things! Do not shut your eyes to
   them. Men and women, I pray you, do not play the fool! If you must play
   the fool, take some lighter things to trifle with than your souls and
   your eternal destinies! Shut yourselves up, alone, for a while--go
   through this matter steadily, lay it out in order, make a plan of it.
   See where you are going. Think over the way of salvation, the story of
   the Cross, the love of God, the readiness of Christ to save--and I
   think that, while this process is going on, you will feel your heart
   melting--and soon you will find your soul believing in the precious
   blood which sets the sinner free!

   III. I had much more to say, but time has gone, so I must close with
   just a few words on this last point, WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF, THEN HE
   CAME TO HIS FATHER.

   When a sinner comes to himself, he soon comes to his God. This poor
   prodigal, soon after he came to himself, said, "I will arise and go to
   my father." What led him back to his father? Very briefly Let me answer
   that question.

   First, his memory awakened him. He remembered his father's house, he
   remembered the past, his own riotous living. Do not try to forget all
   that has happened--the terrible recollections of a misspent past may be
   the means of leading you to a new life. Set memory to work.

   Next, his misery bestirred him. Every pang of hunger that he felt, the
   sight of his rags, the degradation of associating with swine--all these
   things drove him back to his father. O Sirs, let your very needs, your
   cravings, your misery, drive you to your God!

   Then, his fears whipped him back. He said, "I perish with hunger." He
   had not perished, yet, but he was afraid that he soon would do so. He
   feared that he really would die, for he felt so faint. O Sirs, see what
   will become of you if you die in your sins! What awaits you but an
   endless future of limitless misery? Sin will follow you into eternity
   and will increase upon you, there, and as you shall go on to sin, so
   shall you go on to sorrow always increasing. A deeper degradation and a
   more tremendous penalty will accompany your sin in the world to come!
   Therefore, let your fears drive you home, as they drove home the poor
   prodigal.

   Meanwhile, his hope drew him. This gentle cord was as powerful as the
   heavy whip--"In my father's house there is bread enough and to spare; I
   need not perish with hunger, I may yet be filled." Oh, think of what
   you may yet be! Poor sinner, think of what God can do and is ready to
   do for you, to do for you even tonight! How happy He can make you! How
   peaceful and how blessed! So let your hope draw you to Him. Then, his
   resolve moved him. He said, "I will arise and go to my father." All
   else drove him or drew him and now he is resolved to return home! He
   rose up from the earth on which he had been sitting amidst his
   filthiness and he said, "I will." Then the man became a man! He had
   come to himself, the manhood had come back to him, and he said, "I
   will, I will."

   Lastly, there was the real act of going to his father--it was that
   which brought him home. No, let me correct myself. It is said, "He came
   to his father," but there is a higher Truth of God at the back of that,
   for his father came to him. So, when you are moved to return and the
   resolution becomes an action and you arise, and go to God, salvation is
   yours almost before you could have expected it, for, once turn your
   face that way, and while you are yet a great way off, your

   Father will outstrip the wind and come and meet you, and fall upon your
   neck, and kiss you with the kisses of reconciliation! This shall be
   your portion if you will but trust the Lord Jesus Christ!

   As for you Christian people who may be saying that there is nothing for
   you in the sermon, do not turn into a company of grumbling elder
   brothers! On the contrary, go home and pray God to bless this sermon.
   "But," you say, "I have not had the fatted calf tonight." "Oh, but if
   it were killed for the younger son, it was for you, also!" "I did not
   have the music and dancing tonight." Well, they have had it over the
   returned prodigal, over some soul that has already believed in Christ,
   tonight--I know they have! God does not let us preach for nothing. He
   will pay us our wages and give us our reward! So rejoice with us over
   all that the Lord has done, and all that He is going to do! The Lord
   bless you, Beloved, all of you, without exception, for Christ's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE15.

   This is a chapter that needs no explanation. It carries its key within
   itself and the experience of every child of God is the best exposition
   of it. The three parables recorded here set forth the work of saving
   Grace in different aspects.

   Verses 1, 2. Then drew near unto Him all the publicans and sinners for
   to hear Him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This Man
   receives sinners, and eats with them. The Pharisees and scribes formed
   the outside ring of Christ's hearers, but the inner circle consisted of
   the guilty, the heavy-laden and the lowly. They pressed as near to
   Christ as they could, that they might catch His every word and,
   besides, there was an attractiveness about His manner that drew them
   towards Him. His mercy attracted their misery! They needed Him and He
   desired them--they were thus well met. There will be an inner circle,
   tonight, when the Gospel is preached, and it will not consist of the
   self-righteous. They that are full will not press to the table on which
   the Gospel feast is spread--the hungry will be found nearest to the
   heavenly provision.

   3. And He spoke this parable unto them, saying. There are three
   parables here, but, inasmuch as it is called "this parable," it is
   really only one. It is a picture in three panels representing the same
   scene from different points of view.

   4. What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he loses one of them,
   does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that
   which is lost, until he finds it? It has a new importance in his eyes,
   for it is lost. Before, it was only one of a hundred in the fold, but
   now it is one distinct and separate from all the rest, and the
   shepherd's thought is fixed upon it.

   5. 6. And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
   And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors,
   saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was
   lost. No doubt he was glad that the other sheep were not lost, but that
   joy was, for a while, quite eclipsed in the more striking and vivid joy
   over the one which had been lost!

   7. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner
   that repents, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no
   repentance. If such there is--and there are many who think that they
   belong to this class--they bring no joy to the great Shepherd. But you
   who have had to mourn over your lost estate set the bells of Heaven
   ringing with a new melody when you are recovered by the great Redeemer!
   The first of these three parables may be said to represent salvation in
   reference to the work of the Son of God as the great Seeker and Saver
   of the souls of men. In the second, we have a representation of the
   work of the Holy Spirit in the Church of God.

   8. Or what woman, having ten pieces of silver, if she loses one piece,
   does not light a candle and sweep the house, and seek diligently till
   she finds it? Her thoughts were all concerning that one lost piece. It
   had not more intrinsic value than the rest, but, being lost, it called
   off her attention from the other nine. She valued it and for the hope
   of finding it she lighted a candle, swept the house and sought
   diligently till she found it. This is a picture of the Holy Spirit's
   work in seeking for lost souls. They bear the King's impress--they are
   coins of the realm. This woman knew that the silver coin was not far
   away, so she swept the house and sought diligently, using all her eyes,
   devoting all her time to this one object, quitting all other avocations
   until she found it.

   9. And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbors
   together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I
   had lost. She might never have called them together to rejoice that she
   had ten pieces of silver--she might even have hidden them--and the joy
   she had in them might have been only her own, a solitary joy. But now
   that the one piece had been lost and had been found, again, she says,
   "Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."

   10. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
   angels of God over one sinner that repents. Not joy among the angels,
   as some read it, though no doubt that is a truth, but, "joy in the
   presence of the angels of God." And what can that mean but that God,
   Himself, rejoices, and rejoices so that angels perceive it! And no
   doubt they then join in the delight! But all this points out that it is
   the lost one that is the great object of consideration, that out of any
   congregation where the Gospel is preached, it is the lost one who is
   the most important person in the whole place! In the next verses, we
   get the Father's part in the work of the recovery of the wanderer.

   11-13. And He said, A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them
   said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to
   me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after, the
   younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far
   country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. His heart
   was far away when he asked his father to give him his portion and now
   his body is far away as he goes into the outward wandering which
   follows after the inner wandering.

   14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
   land. There generally does arise "a mighty famine" in such cases.
   Famines and other miseries are God's messengers which He sends after
   His wandering children.

   14. And he began to be in want. This was a new sensation to him--he had
   never known it when he was at home. He did not know it in his first
   boisterous days away from his father's house, but now, "he began to be
   in want."

   16. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he
   sent him into his fields to feed swine. Perhaps he did not want to
   employ him but said that he would give him that occupation if he cared
   to accept it. It was small pay, very dishonoring work to a Jew, not fit
   employment for the son of a nobleman, yet, "half a loaf is better than
   no bread," so he took it, though even the half loaf must have been a
   very small one.

   16. And he would gladly have filled his belly with the husks that the
   swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. Such a thing as generosity was
   not known in that country. His companions could share his riches when
   he was living riotously, but they will not share their riches, now that
   he is in his poverty.

   17. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my
   father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! "My
   father's day-laborers have bread enough and to spare, yet I, his child,
   perish with hunger."

   18. 19. I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
   Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and before you, and am no more
   worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired servants.
   You notice that this last part of the prayer he never did pray, for it
   was stopped by his father's love! There was a legalism about it,
   naturally suggested by his own despair, but it was not such as his
   father would tolerate.

   20, 21. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
   great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and
   fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I
   have sinned against Heaven, and in your sight, and am no more worthy to
   be called your son. There comes an interruption there; the kiss upon
   his lips stops the rest of the prayer, which he had prepared, and now
   the father declares his will concerning the wanderer.

   22-24. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,
   and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
   and bring here the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be
   merry: for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
   is found. And they began to be merry. I have never read that they left
   off being merry, for the conversion of a soul is enough to make eternal
   joy in the hearts of the righteous!

   25, 26. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
   near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the
   servants, and asked what these things meant. This was a new thing and,
   apparently, a thing that he did not care much about. How had it come to
   pass that there was such noise, such joy?

   27, 28. And he said unto him, Your brother is come; and your father has
   killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound. And
   he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out and
   pleaded with him. I hardly know which to admire most, the love of the
   father when he fell upon the neck of the prodigal, or the love of the
   father when he went out to talk with his elder son! "Therefore came his
   father out, and pleaded with him." Oh, our God is very good to us when
   we give way to naughty tempers! If we begin to think that we are very
   holy people, that we have been long the servants of God and that there
   ought to be some little fuss made over us as well as over great sinners
   that come into the Church, then our Father is very gentle, and He comes
   out and entreats us.

   29. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years have I
   served you, neither transgressed I at any time your commandment: and
   yet you have never given me a kid, that I might make merry with my
   friends. "I have had no banquets. I have kept at home, a patient
   worker, and have had no extraordinary joys." I know some Christian
   workers who are very much in this condition. They keep on and on and on
   in holy service, and they do well, but they seldom have great
   entertainment's of high joy and unspeakable delight. It is their own
   fault and it is a thousand pities that they do not have them, for they
   might have them if they would! There is a tendency to grow so absorbed
   in service, like Martha, that we are cumbered by it--and we do not have
   the joy of Mary in communion at the Master's feet. I am sure that this
   elder son was out of fellowship with his father, or else he would not
   have talked as he did. We are all apt to get into such a condition. See
   to it, you who work for Jesus, that it is not so with you! Then the
   elder brother went on to say--

   30. But as soon as this son of yours came, which has devoured your
   living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf. I do not
   read that the prodigal had devoured his father's living with
   harlots--that is the elder brother's version of it. I dare say that it
   was true, but it is always a pity to give the roughest interpretation
   to things. He had spent his substance "in riotous living." When we are
   cross, we generally use the ugliest words we can--we may think that we
   are speaking forcibly, but, indeed, we are speaking naughtily--and not
   as our Father would have us speak.

   31. And he said unto him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I
   have is yours. Oh, what a word was that! How it reminds Christians of
   their privileges, if they would but appropriate them! It is yours,
   Beloved, to live always with your God and to know that all that He has
   is yours! You ought to live in a perpetual festival--for you there
   should be one joyful Christmastide that lasts from the beginning of the
   year to the end of it! "Son, you are always with me, and all that I
   have is yours."

   32. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this your
   brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. It
   was the fit thing, and the proper thing, and the right thing, that
   there should be extraordinary joy over a returning sinner. There ought
   to be, there must be, there shall be special music and dancing over
   sinners saved by the Grace of God! The Lord give us some such, tonight,
   and make us glad over them! Amen.

The Believer's Heritage of Joy

   (No. 2415)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 2, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   22, 1887.

   "Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever: for they are the
   rejoicing of my heart." Psalm 119:111.

   WHEN David wrote these words, he was not in a condition of ease and
   luxury. He was not in a position of assured safety, for he says in the
   109th verse, "My soul is continually in my hand." You know what we mean
   when we say that a man carries his life in his hand--that is to say, he
   expects death, he is in imminent peril--and may, at any moment, be cut
   off from his fellows. It was when David was in such a condition as
   that, hunted, as he tells us in another place, like a partridge upon
   the mountains, that he could say, "Your testimonies have I taken as an
   heritage forever." He was rich in his poverty, he was enthroned in his
   exile, he was happy in his sorrow and they who have enjoyed a similar
   experience in their times of distress know how this can be!

   I. With no further preface, I want to talk to you about our text under
   four heads, the first of which will be, LET US MAKE A MAP OF THIS
   ESTATE--"Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever."

   There was David's heritage, that portion of goods that fell to him,
   that piece of goodly land that was his lot-- "Your testimonies." Ah,
   Brothers and Sisters, I cannot draw a complete map of this estate, it
   is so large, so wonderful, but, thank God, you can go and see it for
   yourselves! Walk over its broad acres, lie down in its green pastures,
   rest beside its still waters. It is, indeed, a wealthy country that is
   described in those two words, "Your testimonies."

   But what does the Psalmist mean by this declaration? He means, first,
   that he had a heritage of truth in the testimonies of God. A man's mind
   is rich very much in proportion to the truth he knows. He who knows the
   Word of God is mentally rich--he has a large heritage. There are
   persons, I am told--deists--who believe in God, but who do not believe
   in the Word of God. They believe, then, in a god who has never spoken,
   a silent god, a god who has, at any rate, never spoken to his noblest
   creatures most capable of understanding his mind. To them, God is One
   who remains locked up forever in exclusiveness, except so far as His
   works may reveal Him. I think there are many difficulties in the way of
   receiving such a theory as that. Whatever difficulties there may be
   about God having spoken to us and given us testimonies--and that is the
   meaning of the word in our text--there are none so great to overcome as
   this one would be, that, through all these ages, so many men have
   sought after God and so many craving hearts have yearned to find God,
   yet He should have suffered six thousand years, at least, to pass, and
   should never have spoken to men a single word that they can understand!

   Now, so far from accepting that theory, I believe this Word of God to
   be God's testimony, God's speech, God's declaration about Himself and
   about many other things that His creatures need to know--God's
   witness-bearing to us, out of the depth of His Divine Knowledge--that
   we may know and understand and see things aright. And I say, and I am
   sure that many of you will say with me, these speeches of God, these
   Revelations of God which I find in these two Books of the Old and the
   New Testaments are my heritage. I rejoice to accept them as the estate
   of my mind, the treasure of my thought, the mint of the heavenly realm,
   the mine from which I can explore fresh veins of thought as long as I
   live, claiming all as my heritage forever! I have been preaching the
   Word of God these 26 years in this one place to very much the same
   congregation all the while and if I had been obliged to preach from any
   other book, I would have worn it threadbare by this time! But the Bible
   is as fresh to me, today, as when first I began to speak from it as a
   boy, and preached to you from it as a youth. It is an inexhaustible
   heritage of mental wealth to the man who will accept it and give his
   mind to the study of it.

   Look at the doctrines, the precepts, the promises, the prophecies, the
   histories, the experiences--it is no use for me to try to map out this
   estate, it is so large! As a great heritage of mental wealth, it makes
   every man who receives it, however illiterate he may be upon other
   subjects, a wealthy man spiritually, while they who discard it become
   poverty-stricken in mind, whatever else of mental attainments they may
   possess. That is the first meaning of our text, God's testimonies are a
   heritage of truth to the man who receives them.

   The next meaning is that God's Covenant is our heritage. The word,
   "testimonies," may be understood to mean, and it does mean, God's
   Covenant. When the Lord Jehovah entered into Covenant with men, He made
   a testimony to them that He would do this and that--His testimony made
   the Covenant--and the Covenant was His testimony to men. Now, I can
   say, and many of you can say with me, I have taken God's Covenant to be
   my heritage forever. And what a heritage that Covenant is, dear
   Friends! This is one of its clauses, "A new heart also will I give you,
   and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony
   heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh." This
   is another clause in the Covenant, "I will cleanse them from all their
   iniquity, whereby they have sinned against Me; and I will pardon all
   their iniquities, whereby they have sinned and whereby they have
   transgressed against Me. And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise
   and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all
   the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all
   the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it."

   Again we read, "This is the Covenant that I will make with them after
   those days, says the Lord, I will put My Laws into their hearts, and in
   their minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I
   remember no more." "I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall
   not depart from Me." "I have loved you with an everlasting love:
   therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn you." "I will betroth you
   unto Me forever; yes, I will betroth you unto Me in righteousness, and
   in judgment, and in lovingkindness and in mercies. I will even betroth
   you unto Me in faithfulness: and you shall know the Lord." If I took
   the whole range of the Covenant, one entire night would not be
   sufficient time in which to explain it--I would need seven weeks full
   of seven sermons a day before I could even go round the fringe of the
   Covenant! Therefore, well might David say that within the compass of
   that Covenant he found a heritage which he had taken to himself to be
   his, forever--to be the rejoicing of his heart.

   I have not, however, yet brought out all the meaning of our text, or
   shown you the full map of the estate that is here named, "your
   testimonies." The greatest testimony of God in all the world is Jesus
   Christ. He is God's testimony embodied. God said to us, "If you want to
   know what I am, look, there is My Son." And Jesus came and said, "He
   that has seen the Son has seen the Father." Jesus Christ is God's
   testimony against sin, for Christ died through our sin. He is God's
   testimony concerning Divine Love, for God so loved us that He gave His
   Son to die for us. In Christ you will find that the more you study Him,
   the more you will see what the invisible God is, for He is "the image
   of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature." Now, Beloved, I
   can say, and many of you can say, "We have taken the Lord Jesus Christ
   to be our heritage forever"--we are complete in Him, perfect in Christ
   Jesus--Christ is all and in all to us. When we once get Christ, we get
   everything! "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for
   us all, how shall He not, with Him, also freely give us all things?"

   Now, take the testimonies mentioned in our text to be God's Word, God's
   Covenant, God's Son and there you have a map of your great estate, your
   goodly heritage. Oh, may the Lord, in His infinite mercy, make us to be
   so enchanted with this estate, so enraptured with this Divine property,
   that we shall never rest until we enter into full and final possession
   of it--and find it to be the rejoicing of our heart!

   II. Secondly, I want you to proceed to TAKE POSSESSION OF THE ESTATE.
   What did David say? "Your testimonies have I taken." He had taken
   possession of them and our next enquiry must be, how can we take
   possession of them?

   I need not, this evening, repeat what I did this morning. You remember
   how I went to our friend, behind me, and offered him my hand and he
   took it? [Sermon #1964, Volume 33--Why Is Faith so Feeble?] Now, this
   blessed estate of Divine Grace is as free to any soul who is willing to
   have it as a shake of my hand was to my friend when he grasped it this
   morning! The Gospel of Grace is as free as the air you breathe--

   "None are excluded hence but those

   Who do, themselves, exclude."

   If the door is ever shut, you have shut it yourselves! This blessed
   estate is for every man who is willing to take it. How, then, am I to
   take it?

   Well, first, by a deliberate choice. David said to the Lord, "Your
   testimonies have I taken by my own deliberate choice, I have elected to
   make them my life's chief treasure." I, too, can say, "Because God has
   chosen me, I have chosen Him. I have deliberately chosen His Book to be
   my guide, His Covenant to be my trust, His Son to be my Savior." And I
   know that there are many of you, here, who can make that choice,
   tonight, because you have made it for many years. Would you change your
   Bible for anything written by man? Would you change the Covenant for
   any other compact? Would you change your Savior for any other? God
   forbid! We have taken God's testimonies to be our heritage forever--
   willingly, by His Grace, choosing His Grace, being first chosen by Him
   and, therefore, choosing Him in return!

   Next to our choice of God's testimonies comes the act of faith which is
   a personal grip of them. After I had preached in this place one
   morning, there was a sinner convinced of sin and led to tremble before
   God. He saw his brother after the service and he asked him, "What must
   I do to be saved?" "Believe," he said. "Well, Brother," he said, "I
   always did believe! I always have believed the things that are preached
   and the things that are in the Bible. What more am I to do?" His
   brother answered, "Why, take them! Grasp them as your own." "I never
   saw that before," said the man, and so he was brought into the Light of
   God! Now, that is faith! Faith is the hand that grips the Savior and
   holds Him fast! There is a book. I believe it to be a hymnbook. I need
   a hymnbook in order to give out a hymn, so I take it up and use it for
   its own purpose. There is Christ. I believe Him to be a Savior and I
   need a Savior. I take Him as a Savior to save me--that is faith! Can
   you believe that Christ can save you and that He will? Then believe it!
   "I believe that He has saved my mother." Yes, but that is not saving
   faith. "I believe that He can save my sister." True, but that is not
   saving faith. Do you believe for yourself that He can save you? And
   will you stake your immortal existence upon His power to save you? Will
   you just rest on Him, sink or swim? If you will do that, you shall
   swim! He never sank who rested on the Lord Jesus Christ! Well, then,
   that is the way to take this inheritance, to take it by the grip of
   faith and say, "It is mine!"

   "But suppose I were to take it," says one, "and it should not be mine?"
   That never happened yet, and never will, for Jesus, Himself, said, "Him
   that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out." No man ever yet took
   Jesus Christ by mistake! If you will have Him, you have Him, and He
   will never say no to you. Take Him and He takes you at the same time.
   May God grant that you may understand that Truth of God and put it in
   to practice at once! Thus let us proceed to take this estate by
   deliberate choice and by appropriating faith.

   After we have done that, the next thing is to take the full possession
   of this estate by holy diligence. He that believes in Christ has the
   Everlasting Covenant--he has God's testimonies--they are all his, but
   he does not yet fully enjoy them. I know a friend who has an estate
   over which I am pretty sure he has never fully walked, for it is so
   large. He has climbed the highest hill, but he cannot possibly have
   seen half the property that belongs to him! There are many such estates
   that the owners have not fully seen and there is not a Christian, here,
   who has ever seen a tenth part of what belongs to him! In the exercise
   of this holy diligence, you and I have to take possession of the Word
   of God by studying it more earnestly, to take possession of the
   Covenant by believing it more fully and to take possession of Christ by
   communing with Him more closely and using Him more constantly, so that
   we may say with David, "Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage
   forever."

   Keep on taking, keep on taking, keep on taking! You know the story that
   is told about the hymn, "More to follow"--how Mr. Rowland Hill, having
   determined to give to some poor minister a hundred pounds, sent him £5
   and wrote in the envelope, "More to follow." To his surprise, at the
   end of a month, there came another one with, "More to follow," and so
   it kept on, time after time, till the amount was all given. That is the
   pity of it--it was all given, some time or other. "More to follow" came
   to an end. But it is never so with God! With Him it is, "always more to
   follow." From strength to strength, from joy to joy, from Grace to
   Grace, we still go on till we come to Heaven--and I suppose, that even
   there we shall still go on and on in everlasting progress scaling
   successive heights of bliss! We shall continue to become fuller of
   glory, or, if always full, yet we shall be made more capacious, that
   the fullness may be still greater. "Your testimonies have I taken." Go
   on taking them, Brothers and Sisters, take them to be your heritage
   forever!

   I wish that I could hope that everybody here had, by deliberate choice,
   by appropriating faith and by holy diligence, taken all the Covenant of
   God, all the Revelation of God and all the Christ of God to be his
   heritage forever!

   III. Now, thirdly, LET US CONSIDER THE HOLDING. "Your testimonies have
   I taken as an heritage forever."

   You see what kind of holding we have of this heritage. It is not
   leasehold, a shorter term every night we go to bed. It is not even a
   holding similar to that which is commonly used in Scotland, when the
   lease is for 999 years. No, it is a perpetual holding--"Your
   testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever." Well, dear Friend,
   that is long enough, is it not? What else will you ever take on such a
   tenancy as that? That is a freehold! "Your testimonies have I taken as
   an heritage forever."

   "Well," says one, "I have a freehold." Yes, but you will not be free to
   hold it forever. You may be a freeholder, my dear Sir, but you will
   have to go and your heir will step into your place! Somebody else will
   walk those acres and call your home his own--you have only a life-lease
   of it at the very outside. It is delightful to think that this
   inheritance of the Word of God, the Covenant of God, the Christ of God,
   we have forever because we shall live forever and we shall hold it
   forever! It is not dependent upon any one life--it is dependent upon
   three lives--and those three lives are the life of the Father, the life
   of the Son and the life of the Holy Spirit! And they are all
   eternal--and so shall the joy and the wealth of every Believer be! We
   have taken this inheritance forever.

   Sometimes we possess certain things which are ours, completely ours,
   but then they are not ours forever because they fade. But our
   inheritance will never fade or pass away. The crown that was won at the
   Greek games, though made of amaranth, would yet return to dust before
   long. There is nothing here on earth but is touched by the moon, and is
   ready to wane and to depart. There is nothing here that can be held
   forever, even if we could live here forever to hold it, for all things
   perish in the using. But this is a crown of life that fades not away,
   this is a heritage which, after a million years, shall be the same as
   it is now in fullness of joyful satisfaction! O you people who only
   think about what you are going to do tomorrow, or about what you will
   do during the next, well, say 50 years! You sometimes say, "It will be
   all the same a 100 years from now." Yes, but suppose it is--what will
   it be a thousand years hence? Why, some, I hope, will have been in
   Heaven 950 years by that time! Oh, what joy we shall have known during
   that period! What breakings of the sea of bliss over our enraptured
   spirits!

   But suppose any of us shall have been in Hell all that time? Oh,
   ghastly thought! But what must it be to have been in Heaven a million
   years and then to feel that we are but at the beginning of our bliss?
   "I give unto My sheep eternal life." "Because I live, you shall live,
   also." The righteous shall go into life eternal! Oh, the splendor of
   eternity linked with bliss! I beseech you, dear Friends, rejoice if you
   have taken this heritage that you have taken it forever, for it is that
   which makes the joy of it!

   We have to reckon earthly things and say, "That is the value of the
   property; take it at 20 years' purchase, or 25 years' purchase." But
   what must be the value of a blessing that is to last forever and ever?
   I have sometimes thought what it would be to have a toothache to all
   eternity. That would be bad enough, for it is the eternity that makes
   the sting of it. But what can we say of a joy that will last when
   yonder sun is turned into a coal and the moon is black as a sackcloth
   of hair, and this old world, wrinkled like a bottle in the smoke, shall
   be flung away as worn-out and useless? You and I, then, in the
   everlasting youth of a God-given life, shall possess this heritage
   forever!

   Once more, notice that there is no way of taking this heritage except
   taking it forever. There is a way invented by some men of being
   temporary Christians. It is believed by some that you can take this
   heritage for three months, or that you can take it for a certain term
   of years, and then lay it down. They take it not at all who do not take
   it forever! He that enlists in the army of Christ must enlist
   forever--that is the shortest term on which Christ will take him. If
   you become a Christian, you must always be a Christian! I heard of a
   Brother, the other day, a teetotaler, who had been an abstainer, he
   said, "ten years, off and on." Yes, you may well smile at that remark,
   but there are some people who want to be Christians of that kind, "off
   and on." My dear Friends, the members of the Total Abstinence Society
   are ready to get up and say that they will not admit that man, and I
   say the same about a Christian man who is "off and on!" No, no! We go
   in for salvation forever! As David says, "Your testimonies have I taken
   as an heritage forever." You cannot take them any other way. That
   conversion which is not radical and thorough is of no use. If a man
   converts you, another man can un-convert you! But if God converts you,
   I know that what God does shall be forever! He does not make temporary
   Christians, but real, lasting, everlasting Christians, as our Lord said
   to the woman of Samaria, "Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give
   him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in
   him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."

   Will you have this heritage for this term? Will you have it forever?
   Then take it and welcome! May God Himself, by His Divine Spirit, make
   you an heir of endless life through faith in Jesus Christ His Son!

   IV. But not to weary you, I shall close by inviting you, in the last
   place, to ENJOY, AT ONCE, THE POSSESSION. "Your testimonies have I
   taken as an heritage forever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart."
   First, that was an evidence that David had taken God's testimonies to
   be his possession, for they had made him glad. And, secondly, that was
   the reason why he took them to be his possession--because they made him
   glad.

   Now, first, this was a proof that they were his, because they made his
   heart rejoice. If your religion does not make you rejoice, it is not
   worth much. If you do not find a joy in it, you have not really taken
   it, you have not taken it forever, or, at least, though you may have
   taken such religion as you have, you have not taken the testimonies of
   God, the Covenant of Grace, the Christ of God, for if you had done so,
   you must rejoice! One said to me, the other day, speaking of the new
   style of ministers and the old style, "I used to notice, in the old
   preachers, that they seemed delighted with what they had to say--even
   if we did not enjoy it, they did. They seemed like men that set out a
   feast and, every now and then, they had a taste, themselves, they so
   enjoyed the Truths of God they were preaching. But," he said, "the
   modern gentlemen--well, they know that it is a poverty-stricken country
   through which they are traveling. They are pretty well aware that there
   is no spiritual food for the people and so they do not even appear to
   enjoy the service, themselves, but they get through it in a sadly
   dignified way--an amazing way, indeed, showing their own talent and
   wisdom--but there is no hearty enjoyment of it."

   And it is so! But when a man has taken God's testimonies to be his
   everlasting heritage, when you hear him talk about it, his eyes begin
   to flash, his soul is all on fire, he is full of gladness over it! The
   genuine convert, too, who has found the Savior, did you ever know him
   to come see a Christian, and say to him, "Dear Friend, I think that I
   have believed in Jesus Christ. I think--I think that, perhaps, He has
   pardoned my sin"? Why, you say, that man is not up to the mark! As soon
   as ever a genuine convert comes to open his mouth, he says, "Oh, dear
   Sir, I hope that I have found the Savior! I do feel so happy, for I
   have laid my sins on Jesus, and He has appeared to me, and He has said,
   'I have blotted out all your transgressions.' I am so happy that--if I
   talk too fast, pray do excuse me--but I have passed from death to life
   and I must tell somebody about the wondrous change! I can say with
   David, 'Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever,' I know I
   have done so, for they make my very heart glad! They warm my spirit!
   They are the rejoicing of my heart!"

   You notice David does not merely say, "they make my heart rejoice," but
   he says, "they are the rejoicing of my heart." He does not merely say,
   "they give me joy, but they are my joy, they are essentially and really
   the delight of my spirit." Oh, what a difference it makes, when the man
   has truly taken Christ as his Savior, in the way in which he looks at
   his religion! Until you have taken the Covenant, the testimonies and
   the Christ of God to be your inheritance, you may be, after a fashion,
   deeply pious, and yet sadly miserable over your piety. Your religion
   may be as sweet to you as slavery was to a Negro, and not a whit more
   so. But when you have taken Christ to be yours--

   "'Tis love that makes your willing feet In swift obedience move."

   It is love that makes you joyful in God and, being joyful in God,
   nothing is too hard or too heavy for you, and you say, with Paul, "I
   can do all things through Christ which strengthens me." Our feet are
   made like hinds' feet to leap over difficulties when we have really
   taken a firm grip of the eternal Truths of God and have taken them to
   be our heritage forever. It is one of the evidences of Grace when these
   things are the rejoicing of our heart.

   Then, lastly, another way of looking at this Truth of God is this--we
   take these things to be our heritage because they are the joy of our
   heart. Dear Friends I would like to refresh the memories of some of you
   Christian people by recalling your past experience. When you have been
   very ill, what has your religion been to you, then? I know that you can
   say, "I almost wish to be ill, again, to enjoy the rest, and the peace,
   and the delight that I had then!" When my dear Brother, William Olney,
   behind me, was undergoing most painful operations, I went to see him
   and I never saw him more happy than he was, then! I do not believe he
   was happier when he was going to be married than he was when he was
   awaiting the coming of the surgeon. He was so resting in God, so
   rejoicing in Christ, that he could not be more delighted than he was!
   His Master's Presence made him full of gladness!

   Others of us know what it is to lie on the verge of death by the week
   together--and in the stillness of the night to contemplate very closely
   our approaching end--and to do so as deliberately as if we expected to
   rise the next morning to transact our business, regarding the eternal
   state, with hope and desire rather than with fear! We are glad to find
   that when heart and flesh failed, then there burnt within us another
   light that no man has ever kindled, another joy than corn and wine and
   oil can ever give to him who has the largest store of them! O dear
   Friends, I bear my own personal testimony that there is no joy like
   that of believing the testimonies of God, accepting the Covenant of
   Grace and living upon the Christ of God!

   I have often said from this pulpit, and I say it again, that if I had
   to die like a dog, I would wish to be a Christian even for the
   blessings of this life! But then, of course, it is the life to come
   that makes the joy of this present life, for if that were blotted out,
   we might be, of all men, most miserable, for we have more than enough
   of trial and of sadness if it were not for the thought of the world to
   come! But that life beyond, that hope that enters within the veil, that
   vision of Christ's face, that prospect of being forever with the
   Lord--I would part with all the joys of sense to behold His face but
   for a moment! What must it be to be in His Presence--in fullness of
   joy, forever and ever? The expectation of that which is soon to be
   revealed makes us exceedingly glad.

   "Why!" one says, "I thought that Christian people were all miserable
   people?' It is because you do not know them! And there is another thing
   you do not know, some of you, that is, how Christians can rejoice. You
   see, that elder brother, who was such a very proper sort of gentleman,
   was angry at the rejoicing over the prodigal's return and, "he would
   not go in." I do not know whether he did go in, after all, but if he
   did not, he could not tell how merry his father was, he could not tell
   how merry the servants were, he could not tell how happy was his
   younger brother who had been lost and now was found! He was angry and
   would not go in, so he could not know what joy there was in the home.
   But if he could have gone in with his cruel, cold-blooded temperament
   and could have looked on--and if he could have caught sight of his
   brother who had been so lately with the hogs, but who was now washed
   and cleansed, feasting on that fatted calf--I think his heart would
   have begun to melt, as Joseph's did when he saw Benjamin. Then, if he
   had seen the joy of the servants and heard the music, and watched the
   dancing, I think he would have been ready to take a turn with them!

   If he had fixed his eyes on his father and had seen the greatness of
   his father's love, and the joy beaming in his father's face, I think
   that he would have rushed up to him and fallen on his father's neck,
   and kissed him, and said, "Now I know what a blessed thing it must be
   to dwell in your love." Oh, if you knew the joy of saved sinners, and
   the joys of those who have prayed and labored for their salvation. If
   you knew anything of the joy of the happy God, you would understand
   that a truly Christian life cannot be an unhappy one! God bring you,
   everyone, to trust in Jesus, His dear Son! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM119:73-88.

   In this Psalm we have, as it were, notes from David's diary.

   Verse 73. Your hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
   understanding that I may learn Your Commandments. This is a very
   instructive prayer. The Psalmist does as good as say, "Lord, You have
   made me once--make me over again. You have made my body--mold my
   spirit, form my character, give me understanding." If God should make
   us, and then leave us without understanding, what imperfect creations
   we would be! A man devoid of understanding is only a blood and bone
   creation and, therefore, the Psalmist does well to pray, "Your hands
   have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding." But what sort of
   an understanding is desired? That I may learn to discuss and dispute?
   No, "that I may learn Your Commandments," for holiness is the best of
   wisdom and the surest proof of a right understanding is obedience to
   God's Commandments.

   74. They that fear You will be glad when they see me; because I have
   hoped in Your Word. A hopeful godly man is a continual source of joy to
   other people. When a man can inspire hope in his fellows--and he cannot
   do that unless he is full of hope, himself--he lights a fire of
   comfort. Bring such a man into a storm and he helps you to be brave.
   "They that fear You will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped
   in Your Word."

   75. I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are right and that You in
   faithfulness have afflicted me. We are glad to listen to a man who can
   tell us that--an old man, a tried man who can say that God has been
   faithful in afflicting him--a man who, after having borne the brunt of
   tribulation, can yet bless God for it. Such testimonies as these are
   full of joy and gladness to the young folk--they can encounter trial
   with a joyous heart when they hear what their fathers tell of the
   goodness of God to them in their troubles!

   76. Let, I pray You, Your merciful kindness be for my comfort,
   according to Your Word unto Your servant. "Lord," he seems to say, "I
   have been a comfort to others--be You a comfort to me. You have made
   others glad to see me, make me glad with the recollection of all my
   experience of Your mercy. 'Let, I pray You, Your merciful kindness be
   for my comfort.'" If you have lost your own comfort, dear Friends, see
   where you are to look for it--to the merciful kindness of God! Those
   are two beautiful words, are they not? "Merciful"--take that to pieces
   and it is mercy-full. Is not God full of mercy? Take the next word to
   pieces--"kindness." That means, "kinned-ness"--that kind of feeling
   that we have to our own kin when they are very dear to us. "Lord, let
   Your mercy-full kinned-ness be for my comfort, according to Your Word
   unto Your servant."

   77. Let Your tender mercies come unto me, that I may live. "I am so
   broken down, my bones are so full of pain, that if You handle me
   roughly, I shall die. 'Let Your tender mercies come unto me.' I am like
   a poor flower whose stalk is almost broken through, ready to droop and
   die. Let Your tender mercies bind me up, that I may live."

   77. For Your Law is my delight. God will not let a man die who delights
   in His Law! You are the sort of man who shall live. If you love the Law
   of God, the Word of God, the will of God, the way of God, He will not
   let you die! There are none too many of your sort in the world, so the
   Lord will keep you alive so long as you can serve Him here.

   78. Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without
   a cause: but I will meditate in Your precepts. That is a delightful
   turning of the subject--"They dealt perversely with me, without a
   cause"--but David does not say, "I will envy the proud," or, "I will be
   spiteful to them," or, "I will fret myself because of them." No, he
   seems to say, "They may do what they will, but I will meditate in Your
   precepts." When anyone has treated you contemptuously, or dealt
   perversely with you without a cause, instead of resenting it, get to
   your Bible! Meditate in God's precepts! It is the noblest and, at the
   same time, the most successful way of fighting against contempt, so to
   despise the despising of men as to rejoice in your thoughts of God and
   His Truth!

   79. Let those that fear You turn unto me, and those that have known
   Your testimonies. "Lord, make me such a man that they who fear You may
   seek my acquaintance. Of Your great mercy grant that if any of them
   have turned away from me through hearing slanderous reports about me,
   they may be inclined, now, to come back to me, for I love them, and I
   would not willingly offend them. 'Let those that fear You turn unto
   me.'"

   80. Let my heart be sound in Your statutes; that I am not ashamed. When
   the heart is right with God, there will be no need to be ashamed.
   Though you may make some mistakes and blunders, because you are human,
   yet, if you are sincere, shame shall not overtake you. What a blessing
   it is to have a sound heart! But when the heart is spiritually unsound,
   the profession is always in danger. The other day a friend of ours was
   taken from us almost in an instant through heart disease--and when
   Judas sells his Master, or when Demas turns aside to the silver mines
   of earth, it is the result of heart disease. There are many who go
   about in the Christian Church with a ruddy face and apparently with
   great strength of religion--but all of a sudden they prove apostates.
   Yes, that is the effect of heart disease! Therefore, pray very
   earnestly with the Psalmist, "Let my heart be sound in Your statutes;
   that I be not ashamed."

   81. My soul faints for Your salvation: but I hope in Your Word. What?
   Faint and hoping, too? Yes, a Christian is a wonder and a contradiction
   to many, but most of all to himself! He cannot understand himself. He
   faints and yet he hopes. Two apparently opposite emotions may be at the
   same time in the Christian bosom! Every man is two men, if he is a man
   in Christ Jesus. I sometimes think that there is a triplet of
   characters in every man of God, so that he has three different
   experiences at the same time. Certainly he can have two, for here we
   have them--"My soul faints for Your salvation: but I hope in Your
   Word."

   82. My eyes fail for Your Word, saying, When will You comfort me? "I
   look for it till my eyes ache! I strain my eyes to see Your Word,
   watching for it till my vision grows dull in waiting! 'My eyes fail for
   Your Word, saying."' Oh, then, his eyes could speak! Yes, eyes can say
   a great many things! And blessed are the eyes that have learned to say
   this--"When will You comfort me?" It is a good way of praying,
   sometimes, to say nothing at all, but to sit still and look up. The
   eyes can say what lips and tongue cannot, so learn well the language of
   the eyes and talk to God with them, even as He talks to you with His
   eyes. "I will guide you," He says, "with My eye." Be you, therefore,
   able to speak to God with your eyes, as David was when he wrote, "My
   eyes fail for Your Word, saying, When will you comfort me?"

   83. For I am become like a bottle in the smoke. An old dried-up skin
   bottle that is hung in the smoke of the tent over the fire till it is
   wrinkled and cracked--and almost good for nothing.

   83. Yet do I not forget Your statutes. "Beauty is gone, strength is
   gone, comeliness is gone, but not my memory of Your Word, O Lord." What
   a mercy it is that when the worst comes to the worst with us, still the
   best remains--"I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
   forget Your statutes."

   84. How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute
   judgment on them that persecute me? "Lord, I have but a short life; let
   me not have a long affliction." Does he mean, "Lord, I have lived too
   long in this miserable state; I wish my days were shortened"? We must
   not murmur at the length of our days, but we may plead that persecution
   may come to an end. We may even go so far as to say with David, "How
   many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment on
   them that persecute me?"

   85. The proud have dug pits for me which are not after Your Law. It is
   not often that proud men take to digging, but here, you see, these
   children of the Pit learn to dig pits for God's people--and they still
   have not given up the practice! Pits were dug in olden times to catch
   wild beasts, but now, often, the wicked dig pits to try to catch good
   men, seeking, if they can, to make a fault where there is none, or to
   lead us into a line of conduct which they shall be able to represent
   unfavorably--"The proud have dug pits for me, which are not after Your
   Law."

   86. All Your Commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully;
   help You me. What a prayer that is! Store it up for use, dear Friend!
   Carry it home with you. That is the kind of prayer to be prayed on the
   roadside, in a railway carriage, yes, even in an accident--"Help You
   me." "Help You me," is a wonderful prayer! It seems to turn on a swivel
   whichever way you wish--you may use it to ask for anything you need in
   every time of emergency--"Help You me."

   87. They had almost consumed me upon earth. "They had almost eaten me
   up; they had almost burned my life out. Blessed be God, they could not
   consume me anywhere except upon earth! My immortal part would escape
   the burning of their coals ofjuniper! They had almost consumed me, but
   almost is not altogether." When God delivers His people from the lion
   and the bear, the jaws of the wild beasts may be almost closed, yet
   they shall be opened wide enough for us to escape! "They had almost
   consumed me upon earth."

   87. But I forsook not Your precepts. You cleave to the right and God
   will not turn away from you, nor will He let you turn away from His
   precepts.

   88. Quicken me after Your lovingkindness. That is a blessed prayer for
   us to offer. If any of you feel dull and drowsy. If any of you are
   heavy and slow in your movements, cry to the Lord, "Quicken me after
   Your lovingkindness."

   88. So shall I keep the testimony of Your mouth. Spiritual life is the
   root of holiness--"Quicken me after Your lovingkindness; so shall I
   keep the testimony of Your mouth." May God bless this reading to our
   instruction! Amen.

Adorning the Gospel

   (No. 2416)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 9, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 26,
   1887.

   "That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things."
   Titus 2:10.

   I AM afraid that there are some Christians who would hardly like the
   best preaching that they could ever have. The best doctrine that could
   ever be delivered would be like that of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   Himself--eminently ethical, full of precepts and words of wisdom for
   daily life. I verily believe that if some stern doctrinalists had heard
   some of Christ's sermons, they would have said that they had not the
   Gospel in them! He did not preach, every time He spoke, those grand
   doctrines which plainly show the way of salvation, but He frequently
   proclaimed those important precepts which show us the fruits of
   salvation and which help us to judge whether we have been saved or not.

   You will notice that it was often the same in the preaching of the
   Apostles. Although Paul, himself, is a master of doctrine and, in the
   Epistle to the Ephesians, gives us a whole system of theology in
   miniature--though he never shrinks from the most profound doctrine,
   going to the very depths of the Doctrine of Election and to the very
   heights with the Doctrines of Justification by Faith and the Final
   Preservation of the Saints--yet he is preeminently practical in his
   teaching and often deals with the details of ordinary life.

   Exceedingly noticeable is this in his Epistle to Titus. As you know,
   Titus was a teacher of teachers. He had to set in order the things that
   were needing and to show other preachers how they were to preach. He
   was told to bid the aged men to "be sober, grave, temperate, sound in
   faith, in charity, in patience." Further, he was to instruct "the aged
   women, likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not
   false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things." This
   was very close dealing with most practical matters! These aged women,
   in their turn, were to be instructors, "that they may teach the young
   women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to
   be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own
   husbands, that the Word of God be not blasphemed. Young men, likewise,
   exhort to be sober minded." You see how much of the Epistle is taken up
   with the affairs of ordinary life and matters of holy practice. So let
   our preaching be and let Christian people learn to receive joyfully
   such instruction! God will assuredly bless it, not only to its own
   great end of promoting holiness, but also as the means of convincing
   men of sin wherein they deviate from these blessed precepts--and thus,
   by conviction of sin--leading them to feel their need of a Savior and
   thus, incidentally, driving them to the Cross where all hopes of
   salvation must alone be fixed!

   I feel glad that my text is so practical and I am not ashamed to preach
   the practical precepts of our holy faith. Yet I want you to notice how
   continually and how wisely Paul interweaves his practical exhortations
   with the doctrines of religion. He would have the bondservants to be
   obedient, honest and faithful towards their masters for this reason,
   "that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things." Ah,
   you who despise doctrines, who turn upon your heels if there is a
   doctrinal sermon, where are you, now, when the true motive for which
   holiness of life is to be carried out is to be found here, "that they
   may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things"? It is the
   fashion, nowadays, to talk much about preaching Christ, but not His
   doctrines. I neither understand nor wish to understand what that
   expression can mean. Christ without His doctrine? The great Teacher
   without His teachings? The Lord without His commands? The Christ
   without His anointing? Jesus, the only Savior, without His precious
   blood of Atonement? This is Judas-like, to betray the Son of Man with a
   kiss, to set up a engraved image in the place of Christ, a stuffed idol
   from which everything is absent that is vital to the true Christ of
   God! Dear Friends, we love "the doctrine of God our Savior" with all
   our hearts! We have received it to the joy of our spirit and in it we
   find the mainspring of motive which leads us to love our God and to
   walk in obedience to His precepts.

   There are two matters upon which I am going to speak as the Holy Spirit
   shall guide me. First, here is a name of adornment for the Gospel--"the
   doctrine of God our Savior." And, secondly, here is a method of
   adornment for the Gospel. These poor slaves were bid to so act that
   they should adorn the doctrine of God their Savior in all things.

   I. First, here is A NAME OF ADORNMENT FOR THE GOSPEL. Let us think it
   over for a few minutes--"the doctrine of God our Savior."

   Dear Friends, our misery was great, otherwise we had never needed a
   Savior who should be called, "God our Savior." For a little sin, or for
   a sin however great, which had but little of evil in its consequences,
   we might have been saved by some finite being! But if God, Himself,
   must leave His high abode and sojourn here to be our Savior, then was
   our ruin terrible in the extreme! It is part of the doctrine that we
   have learned from the Bible that man is lost and utterly undone by
   nature and by practice, too. And we could not fully preach "the
   doctrine of God our Savior" if we did not show, first, how awful is the
   gulf which is open before us--which none but God could fill. To
   proclaim aright the remedy for sin, we must declare how desperate was
   the disease, which none but God could heal, nor even He, except by
   shedding of His own blood! Surely this is a grand doctrine--that we
   need a Divine Savior, and that there is such a Savior provided--but
   that apart from Him there is no salvation!

   It is also a very precious thought to us that while our ruin is
   evidently great, yet it is most sure that the remedy is equally great,
   or even greater, for we have a Savior whose name is, "God our Savior."
   He is the one door of hope for the most despairing and desponding of
   men, "God our Savior." Further down in this chapter, Paul calls Him,
   "the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ." He that has come from
   Heaven to save us is a Man and feels for us with all the sympathy of a
   man, but He is also God and, therefore "able to save to the uttermost
   them that come unto God by Him." It is the best news that was ever
   published among the sons of men, that He whom we have offended has,
   Himself, become our Savior!

   When no eye had pitied--when, even had it pitied, there was still no
   arm that could have sufficed for our rescue-- His eye pitied and His
   arm was made bare for the salvation of the sons of men! This was the
   Doctrine that, in Paul's days, was whispered about everywhere, from
   Nero's palace, down to those horrible holes where the slaves had to
   sleep at night. Afterwards, in the catacombs and in the caves of the
   earth, this was the story that the poor people came together to
   hear--that God was a Savior, that the Most High had, Himself,
   interposed to save the fallen and ruined sons of men! When it could be
   preached in the streets, it was so preached. When it might be
   proclaimed in the public synagogue, or in a school where philosophers
   gathered, or on Mars Hill at Athens, it was so preached. But when it
   could not be spoken in public, it was whispered and told privately from
   one to another of those who believed. Even the slaves passed on the
   message of hope to their fellow slaves, so that this grand
   Doctrine--"the doctrine of God our Savior"--was scattered abroad as the
   light is spread when the sun rises in the East and hastens on his
   course till the whole round globe is lightened by his golden rays!

   "The doctrine of God our Savior." Once more, my dear Friends, this
   Doctrine is, in itself, Divine, for there is an idiom here by which we
   are made to understand that it is not only a doctrine which speaks of
   God our Savior, but it is the Doctrine of God our Savior! It is His
   breath--the Doctrine is, itself, the very breath of God! This Divine
   teaching, this Revelation, this doctrine of salvation by a Divine
   Savior, has a divinity about itself! Let us, therefore, proclaim it
   wherever we have the opportunity and let us not attempt to conquer the
   world with any other weapon but "the doctrine of God our Savior!" Let
   us take it as David took Goliath's sword from Ahimelech and say, "There
   is none like that; give it to me."

   I do not believe in the science of comparative religions. No! There is
   but one true religion, all the rest are lies! There is but one faith of
   God's elect. There is "one Lord, one faith, one Baptism." There is but
   one faith that comes from God! Paul once wrote the words, "another
   gospel," but, directly, as if afraid somebody would catch at the
   expression and think there might be two gospels, he recalled the words,
   and said, "which is not another, but there are some that trouble you
   and would pervert the Gospel of Christ." There is but one message of
   salvation and that concerns the one and only Savior--and--"there is
   none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be
   saved." This will be thought by some people to be very narrow-minded
   talk, but we are not at all afraid of being thought narrow-minded!

   We are a great deal more afraid of running in the broad way with the
   multitude to do evil and excusing others in the doing of it! No, the
   Word of Christ, Himself, still stands--"He that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life,
   but the wrath of God abides on him. For God so loved the world, that He
   gave His only-begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the
   world to condemn the world, but that the world, through Him might be
   saved. He that believes on Him is not condemned, but he that believes
   not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of
   the only-begotten Son of God."

   So, you see, this wonderful teaching of Paul's reminds us of the
   greatness of our misery, of the Divine Nature of our Savior and implies
   that the Doctrine, itself, is of a Divine order. I think I ought, also,
   to say, dear Friends, that these things being so, our safety is great!
   Our salvation, because we have God for our Savior, is great, indeed! In
   his Epistle to the Hebrews, Paul asks the question which has never been
   answered--"How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation
   which, at the first, began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
   to us by them that heard Him; God also bearing them witness, both with
   signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
   Spirit, according to His own will?"

   You can never think too much of this great salvation! When you desire
   it, prize it as a beggar might prize gold. When you have it, grasp it
   as the pearl of great price! We have, indeed, a great salvation--it is
   salvation from spiritual death, salvation from the rule and government
   of Satan, as well as from the manners and customs of an ungodly world.
   And it is also salvation from the guilt of sin, salvation from the
   dread of Hell, salvation from the fear of death and, it shall
   ultimately be perfect salvation from the least spot, or wrinkle, or any
   such thing! Our salvation to the fullest will only be revealed in the
   day of Christ's appearing, when the body, also, shall be delivered from
   the bondage of corruption, and all the surroundings of this poor
   sin-smitten earth--and the creation, itself--through this great
   salvation, shall be brought into the liberty of the glory of the
   children of God.

   "The doctrine of God our Savior"--the more I think of all that is meant
   by these words, the more it seems to be an ornament of the rarest kind
   for the neck of the Gospel! "The doctrine of God our Savior." Turn the
   words over in your minds--see what a Gospel it is that you have
   received, see how great it is, see how Divine it is--prize it so as to
   rejoice in it day by day and so as to defend it, if necessary, with
   your lives! Rejoice in it so that when you come to die, it shall be the
   light that shall remove the darkness of the last dread hour!

   Let us make a little further enquiry into this Doctrine of God our
   Savior. Why is the Gospel called by this name? Well, first, because
   God, our Savior, is the Author of the Doctrine, and the Author of the
   salvation which it brings. It all comes from Him. It seems to be
   thought, nowadays, that the Gospel which we have received has been
   evolved from man's inner consciousness and that there are to be further
   evolutions which will blot out the present as the human race keeps
   rising, from platform to platform, till, one of these days, it will get
   up--God, alone, knows where--but certainly far beyond any necessity for
   such a Gospel as the martyrs died for and the Apostles declared! With
   such views we have no sympathy, whatever, and we entertain towards such
   erroneous notions the most determined opposition! We believe in a
   Revelation from God and we believe that it is woe unto him who adds to
   or takes from that Revelation. We do not think the Church will have a
   particle of enthusiasm left in it--and it has none too much now--if
   ever people should get the idea that the Gospel is not a Divine
   Revelation, but only the product of human thought. Dear Friends, the
   doctrine that we believe and teach, and by which we have been saved,
   is, "the doctrine of God our Savior" because it came from Him-- He is
   the Author of it.

   And next, it is "the doctrine of God our Savior" because He is the
   substance of it. If you take the whole Truth of the Gospel and compress
   it till you get the very essence of it, you will find that it is,
   "Jesus only." The very substance of the Gospel is Jesus Christ,
   Himself--His Person, His work, His glorious offices. It is, indeed,
   "the doctrine of God our Savior." Beware that you hear no doctrine but
   that which exalts Him! If there is any teaching which puts Him into a
   corner, you get into a corner as far as you can from it! If there is
   any teaching that does not lift Him up, how can it be blessed of the
   Holy Spirit, since it is the Holy Spirit's work to reveal Christ to His
   people and to make Him great in their thoughts?

   "None but Jesus, none but Jesus, Can do helpless sinners good" and,
   therefore, to this Gospel we must adhere with all our hearts! It is the
   Doctrine of God our Savior, for He is the substance of it!

   Yet again it is the Doctrine of God our Savior because He is the object
   of it--it all points to Him. If you hear a real Gospel sermon, it
   directs you to look to Jesus Christ. That teaching which leads you to
   think of the priest and to think of the church, whatever there may be
   about them that is good, is not "the doctrine of God our Savior." "To
   Him give all the Prophets witness," to Him the Gospel continually
   points and this is the preacher's one cry, "Behold the Lamb of God,
   which takes away the sin of the world."

   This "doctrine of God our Savior" is simplicity, itself, and yet no man
   ever understood it except by the Holy Spirit's teaching, for no man can
   rightly say that Jesus is the Christ but by the Holy Spirit. Simple as
   it is, it seems to me that it is the most wonderful thing that was ever
   revealed, if I think of the effect it has upon the hearts of men! When
   Paul began to preach it and when he wrote these words to Titus, this
   simple teaching was being carried all over the known world by
   enthusiastic spirits, some of them able to speak in strange tongues and
   with words of eloquence, but the great mass of them, poor people,
   servants, slaves! Yet, wherever they went, they that were scattered
   abroad, spread this doctrine everywhere and it burned away until the
   great Roman Empire simmered like a pot on the fire and, after a while,
   boiling over and scalding many with its scum.

   The great ones of the earth, of course, ridiculed this "doctrine of God
   our Savior"--it was "foolishness" to them-- and he that received it was
   thought to be an idiot--he had forsaken the gods of his fathers, so he
   must be a fool. Yet the doctrine still went on spreading and then they
   tried to put out the fire and to quench it with blood, but men bravely
   died for it rather than deny it! They pressed to the judgment seats, so
   determined to avow their faith in Christ that Roman governors had to
   write home to know what they were to do. The more they put the
   Christians to death, the more Christians there were! Further cruelties
   were committed--unspeakable tortures of all kinds were invented--but,
   for Christ's sake, His followers endured all! They seemed to come on
   with an almost Omnipotent force to make a huge hecatomb of victims!
   They appeared to press onward through martyrdoms of a most horrible
   kind and all the while, this "doctrine of God our Savior" had a
   wonderful power among men!

   And, dear Friends, you who are conversant with Church history know how
   often this Doctrine has broken all the bands that wicked men tried to
   fasten around it. I often wondered, until I understood the supernatural
   reason for it, what made the French Protestants, for instance, meet
   together in the desert, towards the South of France, while they were
   being dragooned by the king's soldiers and while multitudes of them
   were being hunted to death. How was it that, in the dead of night, in
   lonely places, they came together to hear the Gospel? What is there
   about this Gospel that seems to touch the soul of man and makes him
   quite another creature--makes him joyous instead of sad, and makes him
   so mighty that he dares to defy death and Hell in defense of it? The
   reason is because this Doctrine cures the woe and misery of the
   soul--and brings light, comfort, happiness and hope to it! It is made
   by God, on purpose, to touch the heart of man and stir it to its very
   depths!

   As for the new doctrine that many are teaching--it has not enough in it
   to make even a mouse enthusiastic! It has not enough in it for them to
   bait a mousetrap of their own--and the only way in which they can make
   any progress at all is by sneaking into our churches, obtaining a
   hearing and winning attention, and then, traitors as they are, speaking
   against the very Truths of God that has built our houses of prayer!
   They cannot build their own places of worship-- there is nothing in
   their teaching that can make anybody generous and there is nothing in
   it that can make anybody glad. No, it is "the doctrine of God our
   Savior" that Paul insists upon, and he says to Titus, "having adorned
   it as well as I can with my preaching, now you take care that you and
   your people adorn it with your lives."

   II. That is to be the second part of my subject, A METHOD OF ADORNMENT
   FOR THE GOSPEL.

   Let us enquire, first, who were the persons who were to "adorn the
   doctrine of God our Savior in all things"? They were, according to our
   translation, "servants," but the correct word would be serfs, or
   slaves. These Christian slaves were to adorn the Doctrine of God their
   Savior. Some of these slaves--the women slaves especially--spent much
   of their time in adorning their mistresses. I will not attempt to
   repeat the terrible stories that are told of Roman women and their
   cruelty to their handmaids. Certainly the poor slaves had to spend
   hours upon hours in the adornment of their mistresses and some of the
   male "swells" of the Roman Empire wasted a great deal of the time of
   their slaves--the men, I mean--in the adornment of themselves. So that
   these slaves would have a pretty good idea of what was meant by the
   ornamenting or adorning of the Gospel and it must have struck them as a
   very wonderful thing that they should be selected to adorn the Gospel!

   The word is not applied to the masters, to the princes, or to any of
   the great ones of the earth--but to those, who, in addition to being
   poor, were not even owners of themselves! Slaves in Paul's days were
   simply goods and chattels, but they were regarded as goods and chattels
   of the very lowest kind--they were as often and as freely sold as the
   sheep in the market. Think of how they used to be treated, when, for
   instance, for making a slight mistake in waiting at table, a slave was
   thrown into the fishpond to be eaten alive by the fish--the thing was
   frequently done. The most fearful punishments were executed on them and
   you might have seen in Pompeii the wretched places by the doorway where
   the slave, who was the porter, had an iron collar and a weight about
   his neck, and where he slept under the stairs, as a dog might do in a
   kennel and, perhaps, for years never left his miserable den. Yet these
   were the kind of people who were to adorn the Gospel! Paul did not
   think badly of them. Everybody else did, but he set the task of
   adorning the Gospel by making it lovely and beautiful in the eyes of
   men--to even the very poorest and worst-off as to their position! Is it
   not wonderful to think of, and yet, such is the literal fact?

   Paul also told them how they were to adorn the Gospel. I do not think,
   for a moment, Paul believed that the practice of slavery ought to
   exist. He believed to the fullest extent that the great principles of
   Christianity would overthrow slavery anywhere and the sooner they did
   so, the better pleased would he be, but, for the time being, as it was
   the custom to have slaves, they must adorn the Doctrine of God their
   Savior in the position in which they were.

   Slaves in those days were constantly rebelling. At one time they rose
   up and, for a while, they kept all Rome in fear and alarm, for the
   masters thought they would all be killed by their rebellious slaves. So
   Paul exhorts them, first, "to be obedient unto their own masters." Then
   the man's master, however wicked he might be, would say, "Whatever has
   come over my slave? My orders are exactly carried out--all I could wish
   to have done is done, and done well. He is not an eye-servant or a mere
   man-pleaser, but he does his work heartily and I have heard him say
   that he does it out of love to one, Jesus, who is his God and Savior."
   The slave was to put aside all his selfishness and, finding himself a
   slave, to determine that he would so serve his master that he might
   recommend his religion to his master!

   The slaves were also to be "well pleasing" to their masters--"to please
   them well in all things." They were not to be always quarrelling,
   grumbling and complaining about this, and that, and the other, but to
   wear a contented spirit. Then the master would be sure to ask, "What
   can have come over my slave?" And, by the way in which he acted, the
   slave would be a practical missionary to his master!

   Paul added, "not answering again." Of course, the slaves were usually
   sharp in their retorts to their masters. They did not care whether they
   lived or died and they said hard things. Paul says let the quiet
   patience of the Christian slaves make their masters and mistresses
   wonder what it is that has made such a difference in them. He also
   added, "not purloining." Slaves and servants in Paul's time were all
   thieves. In the writings of secular authors of that period, you
   constantly meet with the declaration that, "to multiply servants is to
   multiply thieves." Of course the poor creatures helped themselves
   whenever they could--if you treat a man like a dog, should you be
   surprised if he acts like one? But the Christian slave might be trusted
   with untold gold! And obedience to this precept, "not purloining," was
   the way in which he adorned the Doctrine of God, his Savior.

   He was also to be faithful to his master--"showing all good fidelity."
   There were Christian slaves who had bad masters, who, nevertheless,
   were faithful to them in guarding their interests, and it was such a
   marvel that the rich heathen who despised the name of Christ, yet
   coveted to buy Christian slaves, for they found them to be the most
   faithful of mankind and wondered what it was that made them so! This is
   what Paul meant when he said that they should adorn the Doctrine of
   God, their Savior, in their sad and low estate, by not being degraded
   by it, but standing up in the grandeur of their Christian liberty,
   determining that they would not be the slaves of sin--and this was a
   wonderful adornment for the Gospel!

   You and I are not slaves! We have been saved from that degradation by
   this Gospel of God our Savior, for our fathers were as much slaves as
   these poor people were, but we are free. What can we do to adorn the
   Gospel of God our Savior? Well, first, remember that the adornment of
   the Gospel of God our Savior is not to be esthetic. We cannot adorn the
   Gospel with music, with painting and with architecture. When you stand
   beneath the blue sky and see how God has decked His world with many
   flowers beneath your feet, and all around you hear the birds singing.
   And when, in the still and silent night, you gaze upon the silver
   stars, you feel that there is nothing we can build and nothing we can
   make that is in the least worthy of the great God. You remember how
   Stephen said of the Temple at Jerusalem, "Solomon built Him an house,"
   and then added, "Howbeit the Most High dwells not in temples made with
   hands. As says the Prophet, Heaven is My throne, and earth is My
   footstool: what house will you build Me? says the Lord: or what is the
   place of My rest?" As much as to say there was nothing in all that
   material grandeur, for, from the very day in which Solomon built the
   Temple with all its splendor, religion declined and decayed throughout
   all Israel! You cannot "adorn the doctrine of God our Savior" with
   anything tangible and material--it is to be adorned in quite another
   way.

   Neither can you adorn the Doctrine by anything peculiar in your garb or
   your mode of speech, as some have tried to do. The Gospel is not any
   the better for a broad brim to your hat. It will not be any the worse
   for the color of your coat. Neither can it be adorned by any
   ecclesiastical addition whatever! Neither can it be adorned by the
   flowers of rhetoric. What grand speeches are sometimes made about the
   Gospel! Yet, somehow, they do not seem to fit it. The Gospel is best
   adorned when most unadorned! In her native beauty she is altogether
   unrivalled, she is then a queen--but when you deck her out, as they do
   who come from Rome, with meretricious garments--her true splendor is
   marred and hidden.

   How, then, can we ornament the Gospel? An ornament should always be
   suitable. Nothing is really ornamental that is not suitable to the
   person upon whom it is placed. Then, what is appropriate to the Gospel?
   Well, holiness suits the Gospel. Adorn it with a holy life! How pure,
   how clean, how sweet, how heavenly the Gospel is! Hang, then, the
   jewels of holiness about its neck and place them as rings on its hands.
   The Gospel is also to be adorned with mercifulness. It is all mercy, it
   is all love, there is no love like it--"God so loved the world." Well,
   then, adorn the Gospel with the suitable jewels of mercifulness and
   kindness! Be full of lovingkindness to others, for you have tasted of
   the lovingkindness of the Lord! The Gospel is also the Gospel of
   happiness. It is called, "the glorious Gospel of the blessed God." A
   more correct translation would be, "the happy God." Well, then, adorn
   the Gospel by being happy!--

   "Why does your face, you humble souls, Those mournful colors wear?"
   Adorn the Gospel by a cheerful countenance and a happy life!

   Men of business, adorn the Gospel by the strictness of your integrity.
   Ours is a just Gospel, for God is Just, and yet the Justifier of
   everyone that believes in Jesus. The Gospel makes abundant provision
   for justice to all men, so I pray that you may be so exact, so
   particular about everything, that when men speak of you, they will not
   be able to say that you make a profession of religion, but it has not
   much effect upon your life. Never let it be so said truthfully--be so
   strictly just that people will not need to count money after you, for
   in that way they will see what is the meaning of the expression,
   "adorning the doctrine." A person asked me, one day, "Is not
   such-and-such a person Baptist?" I replied, "I do not know him." He
   said, "He is a fellow who says a very long grace before his dinner and
   he goes to such-and-such a Chapel." "Well," I answered, "if he goes
   there, he certainly attends a Baptist Chapel." Then he said, "He is as
   big a thief as there is out of prison anywhere." I said, "I hope he is
   not a Baptist. At any rate, he is not a Christian if he is what you
   say, for a Christian is an honest man." Unless we are strictly so, we
   do not adorn the Doctrine of God our Savior.

   Adorn the Gospel, next, by your unselfishness. If you are always
   looking to your own interests. If you have no thought but for your own
   personal comfort. If your religion can live and die within your own
   heart, you have not any that is worth having! If you would adorn the
   Gospel, you must love others, love them intensely and make it one
   objective of your lives to make other people happy, for so you will
   then be acting according to the spirit and genius of the Gospel, and
   you will be adorning the Doctrine of God our Savior in all things!

   Again, let a spirit of quick forgiveness be upon you. Resent no injury.
   Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, "But I say unto you,
   Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
   you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you."
   Thus you will have a fine set ofjewels to adorn the Doctrine of God our
   Savior!

   Next, have patience under trouble. Be not afraid of sudden fear. Be not
   carried away into grumbling or murmuring in the time of your poverty or
   pain. A patient woman, one who can bear up and bear on under all kinds
   of adversity, is one of the greatest ornaments of the Gospel!

   A placid and steady calm is also a great adornment for the Gospel. One
   has seen such gentleness of spirit in some Christian matrons that we
   have felt that they have been an ornament to the Doctrine of Jesus
   Christ. May we learn that holy calm and may the Spirit of God so dwell
   in us that in all we say, and all we do, and all we are, we may adorn
   the Doctrine of God our Savior in all things! May the Lord add His
   blessing upon this discourse, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: TITUS 2:6-15; 3.

   Titus 2:6. Young men, likewise, exhort to be sober minded. They are
   full of spirits, they are very sanguine, they are apt to be carried
   away with novelties--exhort them to have that which is thought to be a
   virtue of age, namely, sobriety. Let them be old when they are young
   that they may be young when they are old.

   7. In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works. Titus was,
   himself, a young man. He must, therefore, be a pattern to young men
   and, as a pastor or Evangelist, he must be a pattern to all sorts of
   men.

   7, 8. In doctrine showing incorruptibility, gravity, sincerity, sound
   speech that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part
   may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. It is a pity when
   the Truth of God suffers at the hand of its own advocate and, perhaps,
   the very worst wounds that Truth has received have been in the house of
   its friends. You must be careful, therefore, "that he that is of the
   contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."

   9. Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters. They were
   mostly slaves in those days. A sad condition of society was that in
   which service meant slavery, yet even slaves were "to be obedient unto
   their own masters."

   9, 10. And to please them well in all things; not answering again; not
   purloining. Not practicing petty thefts, as, alas, some servants do
   even now--

   10, But showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of
   God our Savior in all things. The life of the Christian, even if he is
   a servant, is to be an ornament of Christianity. Christ does not look
   for the ornament of His religion to the riches or the talents of His
   followers, but to their holy lives, "that they may adorn the doctrine
   of God our Savior in all things."

   11, 12. For the Grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all
   men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
   live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. Christians
   are not to run out of the world, as monks and hermits sought to do, but
   to live "in this present world." Yet, while in the world, we are to be
   godly--that is, full of God! That kind of life which is without God is
   not for Christians! Those worldly desires, the pride and ambition which
   are common to worldly men are not to have power over us. We are to deny
   them and to live soberly. This word relates not only to eating and
   drinking, but to the general sobriety of a man's mind--"Denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and
   godly in this present world."

   13, 14. Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the
   great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave Himselffor us, that He
   might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar
   people, zealous of good works. See what Christ died for? See what
   Christ lives for? See what we are to live for--that we should not only
   be a people purified, but purified unto Himself! We are not only to
   have good works, but we are to be zealous of them--we are to burn with
   zeal for them, for zeal is a kind of fire--it is to burn and blaze in
   us until we warm and enlighten others!

   15. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let
   no man despise you. As I have already reminded you, Titus was a young
   man, and people are apt to despise the pastoral office when it is held
   by a young man. Yet they ought always to respect it, whether it is held
   by a young man or an old man. God knows best who is most fitted for the
   work of the ministry--and those of us who are getting old must never
   look with any kind of scorn or contempt upon those who are commencing
   their service, for we, too, were once young. You cannot measure a man's
   Grace by the length of his beard, nor by the number of his years.

   Titus 3:1, 2. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and
   powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, to speak
   evil of no man, to be not brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness
   unto all men. Gentleness was not reckoned a virtue among the Greeks. I
   do not suppose that the people in Crete had ever heard of it before
   Paul wrote this Epistle to Titus. Among the Romans and the Greeks, it
   seemed to be a virtue to stand up for your own, to be like a gamecock
   who is always ready to fight and will never miss a chance of fighting.
   But this Christian virtue of gentleness is a most amiable one and
   greatly adorns the Doctrine of Christ. The world has run away with this
   word, gentle, and now calls many a person a gentleman who has no right
   to the name. I wish that every gentleman were, indeed, a gentleman! It
   is very significant that Moses, the type of the Lord Jesus under the
   Law, was the meekest of men--should not Christians, therefore, excel in
   gentleness under this milder dispensation?

   3, 4. For we ourselves, also, were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
   deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and
   envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness and
   love of God, our Savior, toward man appeared. "The philanthropy of God"
   would be a good translation, or rather, a sort of borrowing from the
   Greek itself. "After we had seen the philanthropy of God"--

   5-8. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
   His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of
   the Holy Spirit; which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ
   our Savior; that being justified by His Grace, we should be made heirs
   according to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful saying. It
   would be worthwhile for you to turn to the other places in which this
   expression, "This is a faithful saying," occurs.

   8. And these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which
   have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These
   things are good and profitable unto men. They are saved by faith--let
   them be careful to maintain good works. "These things are good and
   profitable unto men," that is, to those who practice and observe them.

   9. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
   strivings about the Law; for they are unprofitable and vain. There are
   hundreds of questions which are thought, by some people, to be very
   important, but which have no practical bearing, whatever, either upon
   the Glory of God, or upon the holiness of man. We are not to go into
   these matters--let those who have time to waste take up these
   questions--as for us, we have not time enough for things that are
   unprofitable and vain.

   10. 11. A man who is an heretic, after the first and second admonition,
   reject; knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sins, being
   condemned of himself. When it comes to unbelief of fundamental and
   vital doctrines, we who are like Titus, set in office over a Church,
   must deal with such deadly evils with a strong hand.

   12, 13. When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to
   come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. Bring
   Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing
   be wanting unto them. Paul had already told Titus to bid the saints in
   Crete to abound in good works. Now he is commanded to take care of
   certain traveling Christians and to speed them on their way. It was the
   custom in olden times, when traveling was very different from what it
   is now, when the Christians passed from one town to another, to find
   the Church and to be entertained and speeded on their journey by their
   fellow Believers. Thus they kept up a practical fellowship of love to
   all the saints.

   14, 15. And let our people, also, learn to maintain good works for
   necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. All that are with me
   salute you. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you
   all. Amen. May that final benediction drop like the dew upon this whole
   company! "Grace be with you all. Amen."

First Forgiveness, Then Healing

   (No. 2417)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 16, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE 2,
   1887.

   "When He saw their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven
   you." Luke 5:20.

   I HAVE read to you the narrative of the healing of the man taken with
   the palsy and many of you remember that, last Sabbath evening, I
   preached upon the Pharisees and the doctors of the Law who were
   "sitting by" [Sermon #1991, Volume 33--"Sitting By"] I tried to
   represent the position of many in our congregations who are just
   "sitting by." I preached to the outsiders of the congregation on the
   divers reasons which led to this, "sitting by." I must confess that I
   did not reckon on so large a blessing as I have already seen as the
   result of that sermon. When I came here on Monday afternoon, that being
   Whit-Monday, when everybody is supposed to take a holiday, I was
   surprised, on my arrival at about three o'clock, by a friend running up
   to me and saying, "We are glad you have come, Sir, for there is already
   a room full." There is quite a nice number of friends who have come
   forward from the congregation and who, one after another have said, "We
   cannot be sitting by any longer. We feel that we cannot remain among
   the sitters-by, but that we must come in and partake of the Gospel
   feast and join ourselves with the disciples of our Lord and Savior
   Jesus Christ."

   This blessed result of my sermon has set the bells of my heart ringing
   all the week and I have felt deeply thankful to God for it. I said to
   myself that as I had taken one arrow, which had sped so well, out of
   that quiver, I would take another! Having spoken to those who are
   "sitting by," I think I will now speak to those who are not sitting by,
   but who, indeed, are the principal persons in the congregation, namely,
   those who are sick and sorry and who need the Savior. For this palsied
   man who was let down by ropes through the ceiling was the most
   remarkable person in that congregation! We may readily forget those
   Pharisees and learned legal gentlemen, but we can never forget this man
   to whom, as soon as ever they "let him down through the tiling with his
   couch into the midst before Jesus," the Savior said, "Man, your sins
   are forgiven you." I trust that, at this time, there are some present
   in this audience who are not sitting by, but who are already praying,
   "God be merciful to me!" Some whose prayers are rising to Heaven in
   accents like these, "Lord, help me!" "Lord, save, or I perish!"

   You are the principal persons in the congregation, both to the preacher
   and to the preacher's Master! He cares more about you and about what
   shall take place in you, than about any of the Pharisees or doctors of
   the Law who may be sitting by. God is glorified in scattering His
   miracles of mercy where there is the greatest need of them. Our Lord
   Jesus, when the poor man was let down by his four friends through the
   ceiling, said to him at once, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
   Matthew puts our Savior's words thus, "Son, be of good cheer; your sins
   are forgiven you," while Mark's record is, "Son, your sins are forgiven
   you." Well, Jesus may have uttered all of these words and all the
   different versions of the story may be correct, for it is not every
   man's ear that catches the whole of every sentence that is spoken, and
   we may be glad that there are three Evangelists who have recorded what
   the Savior said. There is no real difference in the sense--and the
   difference in the words may only show that Jesus said all three
   sentences.

   I am going, on this occasion, to talk a little about this man, first,
   before his forgiveness. Next, a little more about his forgiveness,
   itself. And then a little about what followed after his forgiveness.

   I. First, then, let us think of this man BEFORE HIS FORGIVENESS.

   We are not told much about him. If I indulge in imagination a little,
   you will take it for what it is worth. This man, it seems to me, first,
   had faith which went out towards the Lord Jesus. Evidently, as I read
   the narrative, he had been suddenly paralyzed. This affliction usually
   comes up all of a sudden--men who have been about their business as
   actively as usual have been, in a moment, struck down with paralysis.
   This man appears to have been completely paralyzed, so as to have been
   unable to move and, as he lay in that helpless state, he heard that
   Jesus of Nazareth had come to the city-- and he believed that Jesus of
   Nazareth was able to heal even him. It does not strike me that his
   friends would have brought him to Christ unless he requested it. The
   most rational explanation of the whole proceeding seems to me to be
   this--he believed in Jesus as able to heal him and he continued to cry
   out earnestly--and to pray that he might, somehow or other, be taken
   into Christ's Presence. He could not stir hand or foot, but he had
   friends--and he begged those friends to take him to Jesus.

   Well now, there never was a soul, yet, that had faith in Christ but
   what Christ revealed Himself more fully in the way of love to that
   soul! If you know that you can not save yourself. If you believe that
   Christ can save you and if your one anxiety is to be laid at His feet
   that He may look upon you, and save you, He will assuredly accept you.
   "Him that comes to Me," He says, "I will in no wise cast out." Whether
   he comes running, or walking, or creeping, or borne of four, so long as
   he comes, Christ will accept him! And if his faith is but as a grain of
   mustard seed, our Lord Jesus will not let it die! If there is but a
   smoldering faith, He will not quench the smoking flax. Do you believe
   this? If you do, let it cheer you and comfort you. There is already
   something that is well with your soul! It was better to be paralyzed
   and to have faith in Christ than to be walking upright like the
   Pharisees and lawyers who had no faith in Him! The apparent
   wretchedness of your condition is not the real wretchedness of it--it
   may even turn out to be the blessedness and the hopefulness of it! If
   you believe in Jesus, I care not how far you have fallen, or how great
   is your inability--if you believe in Jesus, you are brought into
   contact with Omnipotence and that Omnipotence will heal you!

   This man, I believe, further thought that Christ could heal him, but he
   began to feel his great sinfulness. I am certain that he did because
   Jesus never forgives where there is no repentance. There was never yet
   the flat, "Your sins are forgiven you," until, first, there was a
   consciousness of sin and a confession of sin. "If we confess our sins,
   He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from
   all unrighteousness." This man, lying there paralyzed, wept at the
   thought of his past life, his omissions and his commissions, his
   falling short and his transgressions! His heart was heavy within him.
   He seemed to say to his friends, "Get me, somehow, to the great
   Prophet! Get me within sight of this wonderful Savior! Oh, get me
   within a touch of Him, that I may be restored, that I may have this
   great load which presses me down so sorely, taken off my heart! Worse
   to me, even, than the paralysis is this awful sense of sin. Take me,
   oh, take me into the Presence of this Messiah, this Son of David, that
   He may have mercy upon me!" That I conceive to have been his condition
   before the Word of Pardon was spoken to him.

   Next, being hopeful, himself, he inspired those about him with hope. Of
   course they would not have taken him to Christ if they had not had some
   sort of belief that, possibly, he might be healed. It is wonderful what
   sick people can do even when they can do nothing--how, when they seem
   to be utterly powerless--they find a strength in feebleness. Their very
   helplessness seems to be a plea where there is anything of generosity
   left in the heart of those who are near them. So this man pleaded, "I
   believe Jesus will heal me. I believe He will have mercy upon me--get
   me to Him, do get me to

   Him!"

   They resolved to do it if they could and he was willing to be carried
   to Christ. Four stout stalwart men said, "Yes, we will get you to Him,
   somehow, though it is a difficult task, for the house is small, the
   room is crowded and there is sure to be a press about the door." "But,"
   said the poor man, "oh, try to do it, for it is my only hope. If I
   could but get where Jesus could see me, He would look on me and save
   me. Oh, get me to Him, get me to Him!" The palsied man would make no
   dispute about how it was to be done, so they carried him to the door of
   the house. And then they said to the people crowding around, "Make way
   for this poor palsied man," and he would say, "I pray you, friends and
   neighbors, make way." But they would not. Perhaps they, too, had their
   friends who needed to be healed, or they, themselves, had an anxiety to
   hear the great Teacher, so they pushed and pressed to get as near Him
   as they could. You see, those quibbling Pharisees and doctors of the
   Law had got in, first, and they blocked up the road. They are always in
   a poor sinner's way! What must be done? The poor man's bearers would
   have abandoned the task, I think, but he said, "No, do not give up
   trying to get me in! It is my only hope. Oh, get me to Him! Get me near
   Him!"

   So, next, the man was willing to be lowered into the Presence of
   Christ. There was no other way but to go up those stairs outside the
   house and to take him to the roof. And he, not fearing as many would
   have done, said, "Yes, break it up and let me down." These four men,
   belonging to a fishing town, were adept in the use of ropes and they
   soon had their tackle ready and broke a way through the roof. As I told
   you in the reading [See "Exposition" at end of sermon--Ed.] I always
   feel pleased at the idea of the dust and the debris of the roof coming
   down upon the heads of the Pharisees and doctors of the Law! It always
   delights me to think that those gentlemen would have dust on their
   heads, for once, and since they were there, they were bound to have a
   little of it. Of course, when these gentlemen come to a place of
   worship, one feels bound to be respectful to them, but if they come at
   an untimely hour when there is any rough work going on, one does not
   feel any particular regret! If, when souls are being saved, these
   gentlemen should have their corns trodden upon, we do not even ask
   their pardon or make any apology! Such a work as Christ had to do could
   not stand still for the sake of reverence to the learned doctors of the
   Law! so the roof was broken up and this man, though paralyzed, was not
   afraid to be let down. It is probable that there were no outcries from
   him when they began to let him down. I think, if it had been my case, I
   might have been afraid that one rope would go a little faster than the
   other. But no, the man keeps still in his mingled paralysis and courage
   till down drops the pallet just before the Savior!

   There he lies upon his mattress, on the floor of the house, just before
   the Savior's eyes, exactly where he wanted to be. Here I address myself
   to some who would give all that they have if they could but be brought
   under the eyes of Jesus. The one thought of such a sufferer is, "Oh,
   that I could be near Him! Oh, that I could be near Him! Oh, that He
   would look on me, cure my helplessness and pardon my sin!" What a
   wonderful picture this scene would make! The crowd is obliged to make
   way or else they will have to bear the man and his bed on their
   heads--so he is dropped down into their midst-- and there he lies. The
   great Preacher has been preaching, but He stops. This is an
   interruption which is, indeed, no interruption to Him! His discourse is
   but broken off for a minute, to be illustrated with engravings, that
   men may see, in later years, that what they have heard is but the
   letter-press and that the miracle which is now to be worked shall be
   the engraving which shall convey the Teacher's wonderful meaning to all
   eyes! So the poor palsied man lies there before the Savior.

   Is that where you desire to lie, dear Friend? In your deadly sorrow,
   sin and weakness, do you wish to lie at the Savior's feet? That is
   where I want you to lie and if you will to lie there, that is where you
   do lie. The Lord Jesus is in the midst of us, tonight, and you can at
   once cast yourself down before Him. Do so! Tell Him about your
   paralysis. Tell Him how sick you are, how sinful you are. No, you need
   not speak so that I can hear you--His ears will hear the whisper of
   your soul. Your heartbeats will be vocal to His heart and He will note
   all you say or feel in your inmost soul. Just lie before Jesus and as
   you lie there, what are you to do? This man did not speak a word, but,
   as I believe, he lay there repenting that ever he should have lived as
   he had done, mourning that he should have wasted his life and misspent
   his time. I think, too, that he lay there believing, looking at that
   wondrous Man and believing that all power was in Him, and that He had
   only to speak the word and the sinner would be, at once, forgiven! So
   he lay there, in the Presence of Jesus, hoping and expecting
   forgiveness and healing.

   II. Now, in the second place, we are to consider THE FORGIVENESS
   ITSELF.

   This poor paralyzed man had not lain there long before the blessed
   Master broke the silence and said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven
   you." I think that the four men up on the roof, looking down to see
   what would happen to their friend, would hardly understand what that
   sentence meant! They had brought him to Jesus because he was paralyzed,
   but he had wanted to come, first of all, because he was a sinner! He
   desired to have his paralysis cured, but secretly, in his soul, there
   was another matter which they might not have understood if he had tried
   to explain it to them. It was his sin that was his heaviest burden! And
   the Savior, the great Reader of Thoughts, knew all about that sin, so
   He did not, first, say to him, "Rise up and walk," but He began by
   saying, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."

   Observe that the pardon of sin came in a single sentence. He spoke and
   it was done. Jesus said "Man, your sins are forgiven you," and they
   were forgiven him! Christ's voice had such almighty power about it that
   He needed not to utter many words. There was no long lesson for the
   poor man to repeat. There was no intricate problem for him to work out
   in his mind. The Master said all that was required in that one
   sentence, "Your sins are forgiven you." The burden of a sinner does not
   need two ticks of the clock for it to be removed--swifter than the
   lightning's flash is that verdict of absolution which comes from the
   eternal lips when the sinner lies hoping, believing, repenting at the
   feet of Jesus! It was a single sentence which declared that the man was
   forgiven!

   Next, remember, that it was a sentence from One who was authorized to
   absolve. He was sent by the Father on purpose to forgive sin--and do
   not imagine that He has now lost His authorization to forgive--for, "He
   has God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to
   give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins." Jesus is appointed
   as High Priest on purpose that He may stand on God's behalf and declare
   the remission of sin. What Jesus said was spoken with Divine Authority.
   It is vain for a priest to say to a sinner, "I absolve you." What can
   he do in such a case? He, or any other man who does not call himself a
   priest, may speak in his Master's name, and say to the penitent, "If
   you do sincerely repent, if you truly believe, I know you are absolved
   and I comfort you with the assurance of this absolution." So far, so
   good--but the Master, alone, can really give the absolution--it must
   come from Him who has power upon earth to forgive sins!

   Now, my Hearer, have you never been forgiven? Are you in your pew and
   yet lying at that dear Master's feet--and do you desire above all
   things that He should say to you, "Your sins are forgiven you"? And do
   you believe that He can say it? And will you accept it from Him as
   being by Divine Authority? If so, I think He says it to you, for in His
   own Word He declares that they who believe in Him are forgiven. He says
   to each one of those who are penitent and believe in His Grace, "Your
   sins are forgiven you." Take the absolution and go your way! Do as
   Martin Luther did, in the days of his dark distress, when a brother
   monk said to him, "Do you not believe in the Creed, and do you not say,
   'I believe in the forgiveness of sins'? Now believe in the forgiveness
   of sins for yourself." Trust Christ's Word and you will be believing
   what is absolutely true! Trust it, take the comfort of it, and go your
   way! It is thus that Jesus Christ, by the preaching of the Gospel, and
   by the revealed Word of God, says authoritatively to each penitent,
   "Man, your sins are forgiven you."

   Further, observe that this sentence, although it was but one, and was
   so short, yet was wonderfully comprehensive-- "Man, your sins are
   forgiven you." Not one sin alone, nor many sins, but all your sins are
   forgiven you. When you go into particulars, you are apt to leave
   something out, therefore the declaration is made all-inclusive, there
   are no particulars given. "Your sins are forgiven you." Sins against
   the holy God? Sins against a righteous Law? Sins against the Gospel?
   Sins against the light of nature? Sins of this and sins of that kind?
   No, there is no enumeration. "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son
   cleanses us from all sin." "Man, your sins are forgiven you." Murder,
   adultery, theft, fornication, blasphemy? Yes, in a word, "all manner of
   sin and of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." "Man, your sins are
   forgiven you." What a far-reaching pardon it is! "Your sins are
   forgiven you." At one sudden sweep of the Divine wave of mercy, they
   are all washed away! There is no such thing as a half-pardon of sin. I
   heard someone talking, the other day, about original sin being
   forgiven, but the other sins left. But sin is a whole--it goes or it
   stays altogether--it cannot be broken up into pieces! It is all there
   or it is not there at all--and it is not there if you believe in Jesus!
   This blessed and comprehensive sentence sets free from every jot and
   taint and stain of guilt--"Man, your sins are forgiven you."

   Observe, also, that this sentence contained no conditions--and the
   blessed Gospel, speaking to every repenting and believing sinner, gives
   him absolute forgiveness. Behold, the tally is destroyed, the record of
   your debt is nailed to the Cross! And as for your sins, they are like
   the Egyptians when the Red Sea swallowed them up--the depths have
   covered them--there is not one of them left, however great or many they
   may have been. If you are now a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, He
   says to you now by His Word, "Man, your sins are forgiven you." I pray
   the blessed Master, by His Holy Spirit, to make His Word come home to
   many here with power. Oh, that those dear lips, which are as lilies
   dropping sweet-smelling myrrh, did themselves speak to you! Oh, that
   those wounds of His which are mouths that preach pardon to sinners,
   might speak to you and say, "Your sins are forgiven you"! There is no
   mouth that speaks pardon like that gash in His side out of which His
   very heart speaks as He says, "I have loved you, and given Myself to
   death for you. Your sins I have borne on the tree and put them away
   once and for all. Man, your sins are forgiven you." Oh, that Jesus
   Himself might thus speak effectually to many of you!

   But note that this sentence sufficed the receiver. When the Savior
   afterwards raised this palsied man to health and strength, He did not
   do it to let the man know that his sins were forgiven. The man knew
   that, already, and did not need any more evidence of it. But Jesus did
   it for another reason. To the scribes and Pharisees He said, "That you
   may know that the Son of Man has power upon earth to forgive sins, (He
   said unto the sick of the palsy), I say unto you, Arise, and take up
   your couch, and go into your house." Those unbelieving men had not
   evidence enough that Christ could forgive, but he to whom Christ spoke
   needed no further proof than the power of that voice in his own
   conscience! And if He shall speak to you, my Hearer, you will not need
   any books about the evidences of Scripture, the proofs of Inspiration
   and so on, to you--this indisputable miracle of pardoned sin shall
   stand forever as a holy memorial of God's mighty Grace! It shall be
   unto you for a sign, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off,
   that God has pardoned you and spoken peace to your soul--and this God
   shall be your God forever and ever! To every soul that is in a similar
   case as that of the poor palsied man lying repenting and believing at
   the feet of Jesus, His Word gives the comfortable assurance, "Believe,
   and your sins, which are many, are all forgiven you." Believe it and go
   your way in peace!

   III. Now I close by noticing, thirdly, what followed AFTER THIS MAN'S
   FORGIVENESS.

   He was absolutely, irreversibly, eternally forgiven, for, "the gifts
   and calling of God are without repentance." He never plays fast and
   loose with men. He never issues a pardon from His Throne and afterwards
   executes the pardoned sinner! His pardon covers all that may come
   afterwards as well as all that has gone before. But what happened to
   this man?

   I believe that, first, there was an inward peace that stole over his
   soul. If you could have looked into the face of that palsied man, while
   still palsied and lying there in that hammock, you would have seen a
   wonderful transformation! Did you ever see a face transfigured? If you
   are a soul-winner, you have often seen it. All human faces are not
   beautiful--some are absolutely repulsive! The countenances of some who
   have lived long in sin are dreadful to look upon. Yet I have noticed
   faces that at first I could scarcely endure, when the persons have been
   gently led to the Savior, and they have perceived the love of God to
   them and have at last believed, and felt within their soul the kiss of
   peace, why, they have looked positively beautiful!

   I should have liked to have had them photographed, only it was too
   sacred a thing. Speak of physiognomies--the Grace of God is such an
   eternal beautifier that the face from which you would have turned away
   in disgust and said, "There can be no good thing behind that
   countenance"--is absolutely changed by the Lord's mighty working! I say
   not that a single feature may be altered--the person may be the same in
   feature, but, oh, what a marvelous difference there is in the
   expression of the whole contour of the countenance when Free Grace and
   dying love have cast their magic spell over the spirit and the Holy
   Spirit has made the dead to live, and the person has been born again in
   Christ Jesus! Well, that change took place in this man's mind, I am
   sure it did, when Jesus said to him, "Your sins are forgiven you." He
   was in no hurry to be raised from his palsied state! He does not appear
   to have said a word and those scribes and Pharisees looked on with
   their malevolent countenances, but they did not frighten him--he lay
   quite still and was in no hurry, even, for the Master's next blessing.
   It would come in due time, he knew it would, and he was of good cheer,
   for had not Jesus said to him, "Be of good cheer, your sins be forgiven
   you"?

   But next followed the man's immediate cure. The Master said to him,
   "Arise, and take up your couch, and go into your house." Our blessed
   Master was accustomed to preach the Gospel in a way which I have heard
   some friends greatly question. They tell us that we ought not to bid
   men to believe and repent because they cannot. There are two parties on
   opposite sides of this question--one says, "If you tell a man to
   believe and repent, that proves that he can," which I do not believe.
   And others say, "If they cannot repent, you ought not to exhort them to
   do so," which I also do not believe! Though I know them to be as
   helpless as that poor palsied man, unable to lift hand or foot, yet in
   the Master's name we say, as the Master was known to say, "Rise, take
   up your bed, and walk." "Oh," says one, "I could not say that to an
   un-regenerate man." Do not do it, Brother, if you cannot do it. Go home
   and go to bed--what is the use of you for such work? The man who can
   speak miracles is the one who is needed and the man who can speak as
   his Master has bid him speak!

   Surely, the faith does not lie in believing that the man can, himself,
   do what he is told to do! The faith lies in believing that Christ can
   do it and, therefore, speaking in Christ's name, we say to the sinner
   just as the Lord Jesus did to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch
   forth your hand," and he does so. Look at Ezekiel speaking to the dry
   bones in the valley. Ezekiel, do you believe that these dry bones can
   live? "Not I," he says, "I know that they are dead." The Lord says to
   him, "Ezekiel, prophesy to these dry bones!" How can he do it? It would
   be inconsistent with what he just said! "I have nothing to do with
   that," he says, "I was sent by the Lord to do it and I do it in the
   name of God." That which may seem perfectly inconsistent with your
   reason is quite consistent when faith brings in the supernatural
   element with which God moves those to whom He gives the commission to
   preach the Gospel in His name!

   The Savior said to this man, "Arise, take up your couch, and go into
   your house." Now observe his precise obedience. "Immediately he rose up
   before them all." The tendency of a paralyzed person is to be paralyzed
   in will. There are some persons, no doubt, who have ailments that can
   easily be cured if they believe they can be cured because there is not
   much the matter with them, after all. But this man was completely
   paralyzed, yet he so fully believed in Christ that up he rose and stood
   before the Master! Then Jesus said, "Take up your couch." I think I see
   him undo those four ropes and quickly shoulder his mattress. "Walk,"
   says the Master, and he walks! "Go into your house," says the Master.
   He might have stopped and said, "No, Lord, let me stay and hear the
   sermon out," but no, not a word did he say about it, but off he went to
   his own house!

   Oh, that all were as obedient to Christ as this man was, that, having
   the simplicity of faith, they would render the fullest obedience! But
   thus it often is that the very chief of sinners, when pardon is given
   to them, have given to them, at the same time, a tender conscience, a
   willing mind, a yielding spirit. "Whatever He says to you, do it," said
   the virgin mother to the servants at Cana of Galilee--and that is good
   advice for you! If Christ has healed you, obey Him! Obey Him at once,
   obey Him exactly, obey Him in everything, be it little, or be it great!
   If some say it is nonessential, remember that what is not essential to
   salvation may be essential to obedience! Do it if Jesus commanded it!
   Do it whether it appears to you to be essential or not! That is not a
   question for you to ask--that is a heartless, loveless question. He has
   healed you, do what He bids you, as He bids you, when He bids you--and
   raise no question about it. Take up your bed and go into your house, if
   so He bids you. Or, if He puts it to you, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved," believe and be baptized. Be obedient unto Him
   who deserves to be obeyed!

   Now, lastly, this man, it is said, "immediately rose up before them,
   and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house
   glorifying God." I think I hear what he said. "Glory!" he cried, "Glory
   be to God!" He felt so glad, so happy, that he took up his bed before
   them all and, as he walked along, he glorified God. And would you not
   have done the same if you had been paralyzed and had been restored as
   he had been? And will you not do so? If you have been sin-bound and
   Christ has set you free, surely you will take the earliest opportunity
   of telling others what Jesus has done for you and seek to glorify His
   name! I did not wonder when a Brother lately said to me, "I have been
   spending all the morning in the workshop telling the men that I have
   found the Savior." And one, last Sunday, turned to his wife in this
   Tabernacle and said, "I am saved!" She said to him, "Don't disturb the
   worship," but I almost wish he had done so! What a mercy it is to be
   saved! Salvation puts a new sun in our sky and a new joy in our hearts!
   Believe on Jesus and this salvation is yours! God grant that it may be,
   for His dear Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE512-26.

   Verse 12. And it came to pass, when He was in a certain city, behold a
   man full of leprosy. As far gone with leprosy as he could
   be--thoroughly tainted and eaten up with that loathsome disease.

   12. Who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought Him, saying, Lord,
   if You will, You can make me clean. He felt that the difficulty lay in
   the will of Christ, not in His power. No other teacher would have
   looked at such a man! Everybody shrank from him, for he scattered
   defilement wherever he moved. A leper was a being from whom all kept
   clear, so this one was afraid that the great Teacher was not willing to
   cure him. "If You will," he said, "You can--I know that You can make me
   clean."

   13. And He put forth His hand, and touched him. This was a wonderful
   instance of condescending love on the part of the Lord Jesus and
   touching the leper did not defile Him. On the contrary, Christ removed
   the defilement from the leper--"He touched him,"

   13. Saying, I will: be you clean. It was the will of Christ that worked
   the miracle, that secret movement of the heart of Christ, that silent
   Omnipotent going forth of Divine Energy that accomplished the leper's
   cure!

   13. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. Christ can heal sin
   in the same way that He cured this leper. If He touches the worst man
   in this place, He can make sin to depart from him the moment He touches
   him. It does not require years in order to perfect the work of
   salvation--it can be done in a moment! Such is the wonder-working power
   of Christ--"immediately the leprosy departed from him."

   14. And He charged him to tell no man: but go, and show yourself to the
   priest, and offer for your cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for
   a testimony unto them. Our blessed Master did not court fame. He did
   not wish to make Himself notorious--the crowds that flocked around Him
   were inconvenient to Him, so He did not wish to have them increased.
   There was danger in such crowding and Jesus was wise in His generation,
   so He charged the healed leper to tell no man, but to show himself to
   the priest and to present the offering required under the Law.

   15. But so much the more there went fame abroad of Him. Fame is like
   fire. If you heap anything on it to prevent it from spreading, it often
   acts as fuel to the flame! So, the very effort to hide the light of
   Christ's power made it spread all the more widely.

   15. And great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by Him
   of their infirmities. I wish that all congregations would come together
   from the same motives--to hear and to be healed by Christ! What is your
   disease, my Hearer? What ails your soul? What is the mischief in your
   spirit? What is the malady in your heart? Jesus can heal you! Oh, that
   you would at once seek to be healed by Him!

   16. And He withdrew Himself into the wilderness and prayed. Just when
   there were such grand opportunities of doing good, just when everybody
   sought Him, does He go away from them into the wilderness to pray? Yes,
   because He felt what we ought to feel but often do not, that He needed
   fresh power, that as the servant of God He must wait upon God for fresh
   power for His great life-work. "He withdrew Himself into the wilderness
   and prayed." No doubt it was the constant habit of Christ to pray, but
   there were certain special times when He retired into lonely places and
   His prayer was peculiarly fervent and prolonged.

   17. And it came to pass on a certain day, as He was teaching, that
   there were Pharisees and doctors of the Law sitting by, which were come
   out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the power
   of the Lord was present to heal them. The word, "them," scarcely gives
   the right sense of the original. It should be, "the power of the Lord
   was present to heal." Jesus did not heal the Pharisees and doctors of
   the Law, but He healed many of the congregation. Now, how do you
   account for this power present to heal? Why, by that wilderness
   prayer--"He withdrew Himself into the wilderness, and prayed," and
   afterward, in a very high and remarkable manner, "the power of the Lord
   was present to heal." And when the power to heal was present, the
   patient to be healed was very soon present, too!

   18. 19. And behold, men brought on a bed a man which was taken with a
   palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before
   Him. And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
   because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop and let him down
   through the tiling, with his couch, into the midst before Jesus. There
   appears to have been, according to Mark, some breaking up of the
   material that formed the roof of the house where Christ was. It was not
   altogether such an easy matter as some have imagined, to let this poor
   palsied man down into the Presence of Jesus. And if some of the dust
   from the roof fell down upon the Pharisees and doctors of the Law who
   were sitting by, it would only be what they were accustomed to throw
   into other people's eyes!

   20. And when He saw their faith, He said unto him, Man, your sins are
   forgiven you. Christ has eyes with which He can see faith. You and I
   cannot see it, but He can--"When He saw their faith, He said unto him,
   Man, your sins are forgiven you." This was going to the very root of
   his disease. Jesus knew what really ailed the man--he was palsied in
   spirit as well as in body--and Christ removed the root of his disease
   by forgiving his sin.

   21. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason. The gentlemen I
   alluded to, just now, began to reason. It was just like them--instead
   of beginning to praise God, they "began to reason"--

   22. Saying, Who is this, which speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive
   sins, but God alone? But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, He,
   answering, said unto them, What reason you in your hearts? See, Jesus
   can perceive thoughts! I have heard of "thought-reading"--here is a
   true specimen of it--"Jesus perceived their thoughts and said unto
   them, What reason you in your hearts?"

   23. Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say,
   Rise up and walk? Anyone can say, "Your sins are forgiven you," or,
   "Rise up and walk." But to forgive sins, or to give the power to rise
   up and walk, equally needs God! If God is present and can make the
   palsied man arise and walk, He is also able to forgive his sins.

   24-26. But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon earth
   to forgive sins, (He said unto the sick of the palsy), I say unto you,
   Arise, and take up you couch, and go into your house. And immediately
   he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed
   to his own house, glorifying God. And they were all amazed, and they
   glorified God, and were filled with fear. With awe, and reverence. They
   felt that God had come very near to them and they, perhaps, said, like
   Jacob of old, when he was afraid, "How dreadful is this place! This is
   none other than the House of God, and this is the gate of Heaven." They
   were filled with fear--

   26. Saying, We have seen strange things today. Oh, that we might see
   such "strange things" in this house, tonight, and whenever we meet to
   worship God!

"All of One"

   (No. 2418)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 23, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   5, 1887.

   "For both He that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of
   one: for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I
   will declare Your name unto My brethren, in the midst of the Church
   will I sing praise unto You. And again, I will put My trust in Him. And
   again, Behold I and the children whom God has given Me." Hebrews
   2:11-13.

   AT the commencement of our discourse, it will be most fit and proper
   for us to enquire whether we have any interest in the Truths of God
   mentioned in the text. The Apostle here speaks of those who are
   sanctified and of the great Sancti-fier. Come, my Hearer, do you belong
   to the sanctified? Have you any part or lot in this matter? What does
   it concern you that the Sanctifier and the sanctified are, "all of
   one," if you are not one of them? The more glorious the privileges of
   the Gospel, the more doleful is your state if they are not yours! If
   you have no share in this wondrous union between Christ and His people,
   what we have to say will affect you but little. Indeed, it will not
   even interest you--and why should it?

   What is meant by the expression, "being sanctified"? The essential part
   of sanctification means being set apart for holy uses. That which was
   meant to be used for God, alone, was sanctified, set apart, regarded as
   holy. The vessels of the sanctuary were sanctified when they were used
   only by the priests in the service of God. Of course there arose out of
   this fact, which is the essence of sanctification, the further quality
   of purity, for that which is dedicated to God must be pure, that which
   is reserved for His service must not be defiled, it must be clean. We
   cannot imagine the Holy God using unholy vessels in His sanctuary--so
   that sanctification comes to mean purification--the making of that to
   be holy which was, first of all, set apart for holy uses. Holiness of
   character follows upon holiness of design. First we are set apart for
   God's use and then, afterwards, we are made pure that we may be fit for
   God's use.

   Well, then, dear Friends, are you sanctified? I have heard some make a
   jest of that word and jeer at certain persons as, "saints." They might
   as well call them kings and princes, and then mock them, for there is
   nothing mean or despicable in the name, "saint." It is one of the most
   glorious titles that a man can ever wear! "He was a sanctified sort of
   person," says one, meaning, thereby, I suppose, sanctimonious,
   hypocritical and pretentious. Yes, but that is not the true meaning of
   the word and I fear lest the jest at the word, "sanctified," only
   proves that there are many who, so far from claiming to be sanctified,
   do not even wish to be! It is the last thing that they would desire, to
   be made holy, and set apart for Divine purposes.

   But, Beloved, all those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ aspire to
   be dedicated and consecrated to God! "You are not your own, for you are
   bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your
   spirit, which are God's." You hear a voice which says to you, "Come out
   from among them, and be you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the
   unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you,
   and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty." You
   understand that the Lord's children are expected to be a peculiar
   people, zealous for good works--

   Only reserved for Christ that died, Surrendered to the Crucified."

   Are you, then, a member of that blessed society? Do you desire to live
   to God? Are you anxious to be so pure in character that God can accept
   your service and use you for His work? Well, then, it is for you that
   the words of our text are written. May you drink the encouragement out
   of them and be, thereby, refreshed!

   No man is truly sanctified unless he is sanctified by Christ. The Holy
   Spirit is made the Agent of our purification, but it is in Christ that
   we are, first of all, set apart unto God, and it is by His most
   precious blood, applied to us by the Spirit of God, that we are made
   clean and pure so as to be used in the Divine service. Believers are
   the sanctified and Jesus Christ is the Sanctifier. I am not going to
   say more about that glorious Truth at this time, but I am going to
   dwell upon the very important statement made here, "He that sanctifies
   and they who are sanctified are all of one." This is a truly wonderful
   expression--they are "all of one." Note, therefore, first, the
   remarkable unity of Christ and His people. And then notice the Lord
   Jesus Christ's expressions which prove this wonderful unity.

   I. First, then, consider THE REMARKABLE UNITY BETWEEN CHRIST AND HIS
   PEOPLE. They are "all of one."

   They are, first, "all of one" in the Divine design in the great mind of
   God. It is not Christ, alone. and His people. alone, but Christ and His
   Church who are regarded as "all of one." They are fitted, constituted,
   designed for each other. They are the complement of each other. In the
   Divine mind it was not the Christ, the Anointed, as the Head apart from
   the whole body adown which the holy anointing oil should flow--it was
   the Head with all the members of His mystical body that the great
   Father saw. When the Divine Mind--and we have to speak here after the
   manner of men, for God is not known to us so that we can speak of Him
   otherwise than after the fashion of our poor ideas--when the Divine
   Mind conceived the plan of man's redemption, purification and setting
   apart for His service, God had this one thought. We make it two, but it
   was only one to Him--Christ, the First-Born, and the many brethren as
   succeeding Him in their heavenly birth--being brothers unto him and
   being made like He. The Eternal Father thought not of Christ without
   the Church, nor of the Church without Christ!

   When we speak of Christ, now, we are not speaking of Him only as the
   second Person of the blessed Trinity, "very God of very God," but we
   are thinking of Him in His complex Character as being both God and Man,
   the one Mediator between God and men. Now, the very idea of a Mediator
   implies that there shall be men for whom He shall mediate with God. The
   very thought of a Savior implies that there shall be persons whom He
   shall save. And the idea of men needing to be saved, also, somehow
   implies Christ, who alone could save them. To the Divine Mind it was
   so. God made man in His own image, after His likeness, and His thoughts
   were even, then, fixed upon the Christ. And when He new-makes men, it
   is with the intention that they shall again be conformed unto His
   image. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear
   what we shall be: but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be
   like He; for we shall see Him as He is." In the mind of God it was
   settled that there should be a race of beings who should serve Him, of
   whom His own Son should be one--very God, but yet, at the same time,
   truly Man--and He did not think of His Son in that complex relationship
   otherwise than as being the Head of a vast community--the perfect Image
   to which multitudes of others should be conformed!

   I cannot fully bring out the thought that I see in the text, for here
   we are in the great deeps. But the more you shall turn this Truth over,
   the more you will discover that from of old God ordained Christ and His
   people as parts of one wondrous plan. It was not, as some have tried to
   represent it, that Jehovah made a mistake by creating men who fell into
   sin and that He then adopted an expedient by which He restored them.
   No, the whole scheme of redemption is all part of the great eternal
   system and plan matured in the Divine Mind that by redeeming love,
   manifested in the Person of His well-beloved Son, the Lord might create
   unto Himself a people who should forever be one, akin unto Himself, and
   like unto the Well-Beloved. It was to find fit comrades for that
   mysterious Person whom He of old ordained--and it was to find for those
   comrades a fit Leader and Head--that He constituted Christ the Man, and
   yet God, to be the Mediator between God and men. They are one, they
   are, as our text says, "all of one," in the Divine Design. And the
   Divine Design cannot be accomplished without the glorification of
   Christ, nor yet without the glorification of His people! They are one
   in the Divine Purpose and if either the one or the other could fail,
   the purpose of God would break down--but that cannot be!

   Then, next, they who are sanctified and the Sanctifier, Himself, are
   "all of one" in the Eternal Covenant. When the Lord Jesus Christ became
   the Surety of the Covenant, the Head and Representative of His people,
   He struck hands with His great Father in a solemn league and Covenant
   and He did that, not for Himself, alone, but for us, also. That
   Covenant was made for us in Christ with Christ, as He is one with us,
   and now, today, Beloved, the provisions of the Covenant are as much for
   me as for Christ, and as much for Christ as for the very least of His
   people! They are regarded in the wondrous Covenant as being
   indissolubly one. That first Covenant with Adam was not with Adam,
   alone, but with all the innumerable hosts of men that were to be
   descended from Him. And, therefore, in Adam, when he transgressed, all
   fell and died. And that second Covenant, made with the second Adam, is
   not made with Him, alone, but with all the countless hosts of God's
   elect who were represented in Him and towards whom God entered into a
   league of solemn amity and of everlasting love with His only-begotten
   Son. Thus, they are "all of one" in the Divine Design and in the
   Covenant of Grace.

   But there is something better than this, if there can be anything
   better, for they are "all of one" as to nature. Do not let us ever
   permit our hearts to lose the sweetness of the fact that the Lord Jesus
   Christ is really and truly one with us as to nature! In Him dwells all
   the fullness of the Godhead bodily and yet, notwithstanding that, He is
   Man of the substance of His mother. "Forasmuch, then, as the children
   are partakers of flesh and blood, He also, Himself, likewise took part
   of the same." It is easy to say, but it is hard to realize that Jesus
   Christ is as truly Man as any of us can be. I mean, now that He sits
   exalted at the right hand of God, He is as truly Man as when He sat on
   the well and said to the Samaritan woman, "Give Me to drink." Do not
   let us exalt Him into only a God-man, for if we do, we shall degrade
   Him into a man-God! He is neither the one nor the other. He is
   God--diminish not His splendor! He is Man--Man such as we are--forget
   not His tenderness! In this very chapter, when we read that God has set
   man over the works of His hands and has put all things in subjection
   under His feet, does not Paul say, "Now we see not yet all things put
   under Him"? And then He adds, "But we see Jesus," that is to say, Jesus
   Christ is Lord--He is set on high, Head over all things. Well, then,
   says the Apostle, "This Jesus is Man, this is the Man that rules, this
   is the Man that is over all the works of God's hands because Jesus
   Christ is Man, the Representative of the human race, even in His
   majesty as King of kings and Lord of lords, Man in that relationship as
   well as in every other." Do not let us forget that Believers and their
   Lord are "all of one"--one indivisible race.

   Yet further than that, I want you to notice that they who are
   sanctified and their Sanctifier are "all of one" because of His
   representative Character. Whatever Jesus did in the past, He did for
   us, for we are "all of one." He was circumcised and we are circumcised
   in Him with the true circumcision not made by hands. When He kept the
   Law, we kept the Law in Him, for He stood as our Representative. If He
   died, we reckon that we died in Him and, therefore, we recognize that
   we live because He lives. Now that He has gone into the heavenlies, it
   is as our Forerunner, and He has raised us up together with Him and
   made us sit together with Him in the heavenlies! And in all the Glory
   that is yet to come we shall be partakers.

   Hence follows this further oneness. So are we "all of one" that, from
   now on we are united in our interests. His concerns and our concerns
   are one. We have not to speak of what is Christ's and what is His
   people's, but all that is Christ's belongs to His people, and all that
   belongs to His people belongs to Him! You are Christ's, Beloved, and
   Christ is yours! I am sure you cheerfully would acknowledge that you
   belong to Him--just as joyfully acknowledge that He belongs to you! We
   have fellowship with Christ, which fellowship means a community of
   interests. His cause is our cause, His honor is our honor. If He loses,
   we lose. If He gains, we gain. We triumph when He triumphs, we feel
   disgraced when His cause is dishonored. Is it not so? "Yes," you say,
   "on our part we readily recognize that it is so." But it is far more so
   on Christ's part! He has so espoused you to Himself, O Believer, that
   you are His and all your interests are His! He who marries a wife takes
   her to himself and all her concerns are merged in his. But when Jesus
   Christ took His Church to be His bride, He took over all her debts and
   liabilities, all her burdens and all her necessities. She had not
   anything else to bring to her Husband, but He took all that there
   was--the mighty deficit of her lost estate--He took it over and more
   than compensated for it by the wondrous fullness of His own riches in
   Glory! And now there is no line of distinction between the two--"Both
   He that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one."

   I do not know how to speak adequately upon my glorious theme! I have
   talked about it as it strikes me, but how to bring out its fullness to
   you, I do not know. I wish that you could sit still and enjoy it. Turn
   it over and see the many shades of color there are in this piece of the
   Divine Handiwork! It is like a diamond with many facets which will
   flash with light whichever way you turn it. Christ and you, "all of
   one"--all of you who are in Christ made one with each other by being
   one with Him! Not so blended and united as to become two in union, but
   one--having one nature, one body, one spirit!

   "But we cannot receive the Divine Nature," says one. No, we cannot be
   Divine, but yet we can be partakers of the Divine Nature in all its
   moral and spiritual qualities. We are to become holy and we aspire to
   be perfect even as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect and, then,
   when we shall have reached that blessed point, we shall more fully have
   proved the Truth of God that we are "all of one." But long before we
   attain that height, it is still true, and always will be true, amidst
   all our infirmities and imperfections, that we are still one with
   Christ in nature and one with Him in all our interests! What He has
   done, He has done for us, and it is reckoned as what we have done in
   Him--and it is ours to work out the life of Christ in our own souls and
   to feel how truly all that is in Him is also in His people, as all the
   griefs and woes of His people have been reproduced in Him. "All of
   one!" I love the very words! Even without any exposition they are music
   to the believing heart--"Both He that sanctifies and they who are
   sanctified are all of one."

   II. Now, in the second place, I have to notice OUR SAVIOR'S EXPRESSIONS
   WHICH PROVE THIS WONDERFUL UNITY.

   The Apostle says, "for which cause He is not ashamed to call them
   brethren." He is glorious and they are often in shame and poverty, but
   He is not ashamed to call them brethren! There is an immeasurable
   disparity between the Lord Christ and His poor erring disciples, but
   there is no disparity which His love dwells upon, for He calls them
   brethren! Our hymn, just now, spoke of it as a wonder--

   "That worms of earth should ever be One with Incarnate Deity!"

   And truly it is a wonder, yet such a wonder as Christ takes a delight
   in! "He is not ashamed to call them brethren." They are poor, they are
   despised, they are persecuted. What is worse, they are imperfect and
   faulty, often sorrowful, cast down, condemning themselves, groaning at
   the Mercy Seat--yet, "He is not ashamed to call them brethren." There
   is such a unity between the Believer, be he in what sorrow he may, and
   the Christ, be He in what Glory He may, that He is never ashamed to
   acknowledge the close relationship between them--"He is not ashamed to
   call them brethren."

   Now, as this seemed to be a great thing to say, the Apostle felt
   obliged to quote three Old Testament Scriptures to show the
   brotherliness of Christ and His being "all of one" with us. The first
   passage that he quotes is in Psalm 22:22. Here you have it--"I will
   declare Your name unto My brethren, in the midst of the Church will I
   sing praise unto You." The words in these quotations in our English
   version may not seem to be exactly the same as in the passages referred
   to, but we must remember, of course, that we are dealing with
   translations and not with the original writings. This is a part of that
   marvelous Psalm which was unquestionably the soliloquy of Christ upon
   the Cross.

   Observe, dear Friends, this text is quoted to show us how we are "all
   of one," and it shows we are "all of one" because Jesus shares our
   worship. He says, "I will declare Your name unto My brethren." When He
   was here on earth, He told His brethren much concerning the Father. It
   was His mission to reveal the Father so that He could say, "He that has
   seen Me has seen the Father." And when they worshipped the Father in
   spirit and in truth, it was because He had taught them to do so. His
   sermons inspired them with that devotion! He spoke to them as a man
   speaking to men and so He revealed God to them. This passage also shows
   that Jesus was one with His disciples, for He revealed God not as to
   strangers, but as to "brethren." He declared the will of God to them,
   not as to outsiders, but as to "brethren." He had one way of preaching
   to the crowd and He had quite another way of privately talking to His
   disciples. He declared the name of God unto His brethren in familiar,
   loving, tender tones, always putting Himself side by side with them,
   sometimes speaking of, "My Father and your Father, My God and your
   God," and always setting forth the great God as belonging as much to
   them as to Himself--and always speaking of that God, not as some
   renowned teacher might speak to beings far beneath Him, but as a
   Brother who has met with the Father, and tells of that Father to His
   brethren who, as yet, do not fully understand Him. "I will declare Your
   name unto My brethren." I say, therefore, that the life of Christ in
   His teaching and in His joining with His disciples in their worship of
   God proved that He was one with them!

   Especially is this evident when we come to the last part of the
   quotation--"In the midst of the Church will I sing praise unto You."
   Did Jesus sing? Yes, literally. After supper they sang a hymn. It must
   have been most thrilling to hear Christ's voice, quivering with
   emotion, singing the Psalms which constituted the Great Hallel. Those
   Psalms were usually sung after the Paschal Supper was ended--and the
   Savior went through them, praising and magnifying Jehovah, joining the
   little band, I should think, Himself the leader of the Psalmody that it
   might be seen that He was "all of one" with them! I am the preacher to
   this congregation and when I speak to you of God, I am sure that I am
   "all of one" with you. If I speak aright, you might think that we were
   in a parlor rather than in the Tabernacle. I am not speaking as some
   great orator might, but as a Brother declaring the Father's name as
   best I know it.

   And when the time comes for singing, then we feel that we are all at
   one with those who sing with us from the heart, following the same
   tune, and uttering the same praiseful words. Behold, then, in your
   midst, O Church of God, in the days of His flesh there stood this
   glorious One whom angels worship, who is the brightness of His Father's
   Glory in the very Heaven of heavens! Yet when He stood here, it was to
   join in the worship of His people, declaring the Father's name unto His
   brethren, and with them singing praises unto the Most High. Does not
   this bring Him very near to you? Does it not seem as if He might come
   at any moment and sit in that pew with you? I feel as if He already
   stood on this platform side by side with me--why shouldn't He? Oh,
   happy hour, if we could but see Him in very flesh and blood among us!
   Yet we know that He is here, even if we cannot see Him, for He has
   said, "Lo, I am with you always even unto the end of the world."

   The second passage which is quoted by the Apostle is not very easy to
   find. "And again, I will put My trust in Him." I suppose the Apostle
   quoted from the Septuagint translation and there we get, in the 18th
   Psalm, at the second verse, these words, "I will hope in Him." It is so
   rendered in that version, but Paul read it, "I will put My trust in
   Him." We believe that is the passage he intended to quote. Now we are
   told by Inspiration in this place that this verse is the language of
   Christ and if so, it brings Him very near to us. The Psalm, itself, you
   will see, if you will read it through at home, looks as if it were
   David speaking, but we are here told that it was Christ. Well, it is no
   matter. Frequently in the Psalms you are unable to tell whether it is
   David or David's greater Son who is speaking, which very ambiguity is
   the source of instruction, because it shows how they are, "all of one,"
   so that David, who is the sanctified one, speaks in such terms as might
   be used by the Sanctifier, Himself! The Book of Psalms is, indeed,
   throughout, one of the most wonderful proofs of how near the Believer
   is to Him in whom he believes, so that the very same words and phrases
   which were appropriate in the mouth of David, for himself, are equally
   appropriate if he speaks by way of prophecy concerning the Messiah.

   Still, let me ask you to notice that the pith of the quotation is that
   Jesus Christ put His trust in God. That is to say, He was a partaker of
   our faith. It is by faith that we are justified. It is by faith that we
   overcome the world. It is by faith that we do everything. Had Jesus
   such a faith as that? Yes, He had--it was by His faith that He
   vanquished the adversary in that triple duel in the wilderness! It was
   by faith that He prevailed in prayer on the lone mountainside! It was
   by faith that He went up to the Cross, alone, by Himself, for His
   people! I will go further and say that Jesus Christ is still to us the
   greatest Exemplar of faith. "What?" you exclaim, "in Heaven, is He
   still our greatest Exemplar of faith?" Yes--"from henceforth expecting
   till His enemies are made His footstool." And what is expectation based
   upon but upon faith?

   Moreover, our blessed Lord is always engaged in intercessory prayer.
   Remember this text--"Ask of Me and I shall give You the heathen for
   Your inheritance"? He is asking and He is asking in faith. And the life
   of Christ, now, concerning His coming, His Kingdom and the ultimate
   triumph of His righteous cause, is still an exhibition of faith--and
   this makes Him very near of kin to us. Do You believe, my Master?
   "Yes," He says. Then, as I, also, believe, we are both Believers and we
   are "all of one."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, does not this bring your Lord very
   near to you? Why, as if to show you that He came very near to you,
   there is one point that some Believers omit, but which Jesus did not
   omit. It is described in that familiar passage, "He that believes and
   is baptized shall be saved." Surely, His was a case where Baptism might
   fitly have been omitted! But, no--He comes to Jordan and He asks John
   to baptize Him. And when the good man says, "I have need to be baptized
   of You, and come You to me?" yet the condescending Savior, that He
   might be "all of one" with us, said, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus
   it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness." Blessed are you who follow
   the Lamb wherever He goes! Happy are you who in all things desire to be
   like unto your Head, even as He, in all things, has been made like unto
   you. Are you tried in your faith? So was He! Are you tempted? So was
   He! Temptations of the worst kind assailed the purity of His Nature, as
   they assail you. But He stood and you shall stand! He overcame by the
   use of, "It is written," and that same Sword of the Spirit is ready to
   your hand! Use it, by faith, and so overcome the Wicked One.

   The last passage which the Apostle quotes is taken from Isaiah, the
   eighth chapter and the 18th verse--"Behold I and the children which God
   has given Me." This is yet to be fulfilled. I have shown you Christ as
   He was one with us and Christ as He is one with us. Now you shall see
   Christ as He is to be one with us. There shall be a day when He shall
   be manifested. At this hour, He is the hidden Christ, and our life is
   hid with Him. But He is one day to appear. Then will He say, "Behold,
   here am I," and all shall see Him--even they who crucified Him--shall
   behold Him when He comes in His

   Glory.

   Observe that, in that day, He is to appear with His children--with
   those who have received life out of His life, those to whom He is the
   Adam, the true Father, the Everlasting Father. He shall not appear
   alone--He would not care to do so. He shall be manifested with His
   saints! When He shall appear, we shall appear with Him. "Behold," He
   says, "I and the children." You see, He glories in them! He uses a
   phrase such as you would use ofyour children, a comely group, perhaps,
   of little ones, or perhaps, of grown-up sons and daughters. It is some
   high anniversary--suppose it is your golden wedding, and the glory of
   the day is not yourself alone, but the children. When you kneel
   together at the family altar, you say, "Lord, behold, here am I and the
   children You have given me." You would not be half so happy if you
   could not mention their names, they are so dear to you! Well that is
   how Jesus puts it--"Behold I and the children."

   And then He uses such a sweet phrase about them. He says, "the children
   which God has given Me." You know that, in the 17th of John, in that
   wonderful prayer of our Lord to His Father, He always calls His
   disciples, "those whom You have given Me." He likes to dwell on that
   fact! They are precious to Him in themselves, but far more precious as
   the Father's gift to Him! Some things are valued by you as keepsakes
   given by one you love and so are we dear to Christ because His Father
   gave us to Him! "The children which God has given Me." Sweet, sweet
   words! But do they not show you what oneness there is between Christ
   and His people? The father and the mother are marvelously one with
   their own children when those children have not grieved them, but have
   made them happy, so that they can speak of them as the children that
   God has given them! Then you see how they are knit together as one.
   That is a wonderful expression that is used concerning David, where
   Abigail said that his soul should be bound in the bundle of life with
   the Lord his God. So is it truly with all the Lord's redeemed--they are
   bound in the bundle of life with Christ and He says--"Behold I and the
   children which God has given Me."

   It seems to imply that He would feel Himself bereaved if they were not
   there. If He could not say, "I and the children which God has given
   Me," He would be like Naomi when she came back from Moab and said,
   "Call me not, Naomi. Call me Mara," for she had lost her children.
   Shall Jesus, the great Father of the age, lose any of His redeemed?
   Shall He fail to see of the travail of His soul? Shall the children
   born of His agony and passion, after all, expire, or be taken from Him?
   Never! Glorious Christ, at the last, You shall say, "Here am I and the
   children which God has given Me."

   Our Lord appears, by these words, to call the world's attention to His
   people together with Himself. "Behold," says He--not, "Behold Me," but,
   "Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given Me are for signs
   and for wonders." Jesus will be nothing except His people are there
   with Him, even in the Great Day of His appearing! Oh, I feel as if I
   could stop and ask you to sing those lines of which dear old Rowland
   Hill was so fond--

   "But this I do find, we two are so joined, He'll not live in Glory and
   leave me behind." Jesus will not have Heaven without us! He will not
   have His Crown without us! He will not have His Throne without us! He
   will not have the Father's House without us! He will not go unto His
   rest without us, for He has made us to be part of Himself--we are "all
   of one." Just think of Christ without His people. A head without
   members of the body--what a ghastly sight! A shepherd without
   sheep--what an unhappy person! A father without children--what a
   desolated heart! No, no, it shall not be so! Christ is one with His
   people and "who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" Well may I
   answer with the Apostle, "I am persuaded that neither death, nor life,
   nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor
   things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be
   able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
   Lord."

   O people of God, be as happy as ever you can! Rejoice in the Lord "with
   joy unspeakable and full of glory." If you should be so full of joy as
   not to be able to contain yourselves, you would not be more happy than
   you are warranted in being by the blessed Truth of God which I have set
   before you, that Christ and you are "all of one."

   As for you who have no part nor lot in this matter, God have mercy upon
   you and bring you by faith to look to Christ, and to be joined forever
   to Him, for His dear sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON:

   PSALM22.

   You will not need any comment on this Psalm if, while we read it, you
   see Christ on the Cross, and you think that you hear Him uttering these
   sacred words. This Psalm is dedicated "to the Chief Musician upon
   Aijeleth Shahar, or, the hind of the morning," for Jesus brings the
   morning with Him whenever He comes.

   Verse 1. MY God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? It was not morning
   with Jesus when He uttered these words--it was midnight--but His
   midnight is our morning.

   1. Why are You so far from helping Me, and from the words of My
   roaring? The prayer had come to be almost inarticulate, like the dying
   moan of a wounded beast in the forest.

   2. O My God. This is the third time He has cried out, "My God." Note
   that.

   2. I cry in the daytime, but You hear not; and in the night season, and
   am not silent. The worst grief of a child of God is not to be heard in
   prayer. Think, then, what it must have been for the Well-Beloved to
   have to say to His Father, "O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You
   hear not; and in the night season, and am not silent."

   3. But You are holy. He would bring no charge against God even though
   He forsook Him. 3-6. O You that inhabits the praises of Israel. Our
   fathers trusted in You. They trusted, and You did deliver them. They
   cried unto You, and were delivered: they trusted in You, and were not
   confounded. But I am a worm, and no man. Think that you hear your Lord
   saying this and comparing Himself to a little red worm which, when
   crushed, seems to be nothing but a mass of blood.

   6-8. A reproach of men, and despised of the people. All they that see
   Me laugh Me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head,
   saying, He trusted on the LORD that He would deliver Him: let Him
   deliver Him, seeing He delighted in Him. What scorn! How it must have
   entered like vitriol into the veins of Christ--a strong corrosive of
   dreadful sarcasm without a drop of pity mixed with it!

   9-11. But You are He that took Me out of the womb: You did make Me hope
   when I was upon My mother's breasts. I was cast upon You from the womb:
   You are My God from My mother's belly. Be not far from Me; for trouble
   is near; for there is none to help. God had taken care of Christ in His
   infancy--that miraculous birth of His was under Divine control--will
   not the Lord care for Him, now that He is even more weak and nearer to
   the gates of death than in the first morning of His infant weakness?

   12. Many bulls have compassed Me. There they stood, the strong
   legionaries of Rome, proud priests of Judea, and the princes of the
   people, all thirsting for His blood!

   12-14. Strong bulls of Bashan have beset Me round. They gaped upon Me
   with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. I am poured out
   like water. Dissolved, separated like drops of water poured out of a
   vessel.

   14. And all My bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax. "The very
   fountain of My strength is turned to weakness." 14, 15. It is melted in
   the midst of My bowels. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and My
   tongue cleaves to My jaws; and You have brought Me into the dust of
   death. Fever had worked upon Him. The hanging in the midday sun, the
   excruciating pains in His hands and feet, the dragging weight of His
   body, the tearing of the nails and the continually increasing agony of
   His wounds had brought Him into the very dust of death.

   16. For dogs have compassed Me. The many, the vulgar multitude, like a
   pack of hounds, crowded around the Savior on the Cross.

   16. The assembly of the wicked have enclosed Me: they pierced My hands
   and My feet. David could never say this of himself--no one else but our
   Lord Jesus Christ could talk after this wondrous fashion. Yet this
   Psalm was written hundreds of years before Christ came here among
   men--and the Jews treasured it up, little understanding that it
   described their Messiah and ours--and described Him literally, too.

   17. I may count all My bones. Jesus could look down upon His own
   emaciated person as He hung there naked upon the Cross.

   17. They look and stare upon Me. Their cruel inquisitive gazing galled
   His delicate sensitive Nature. 18-21. They part My garments among them,
   and cast lots upon My vesture. But be not You far from Me, O LORD: O My
   Strength, hasten You to help Me. Deliver My soul from the sword; My
   precious life from the power of the dog. Save Me from the lion's mouth:
   for You have heard Me from the horns of the wild oxen! He had been
   heard in past years and He pleads for similar acceptance now. He
   encourages His faith by a retrospect of God's preserving power in
   former dangers.

   22. I will declare Your name unto My brethren: in the midst of the
   congregation will I praise You. A gleam of sunlight now comes over the
   Cross. the thick darkness is melting away and the Savior is triumphing
   even in His dying hour! He is passing away from the agonizing cry, "Why
   have You forsaken Me?" to His last victorious utterance, "It is
   finished!" A wonderful change comes over the Savior's expressions from
   this point.

   23, 24. You that fear the LORD, praise Him; all you the seed of Jacob,
   glorify Him; and fear Him, all you the seed of Israel. For He has not
   despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither has He
   hid His face from Him; but when He cried unto Him, He heard. Here is
   the testimony of One who suffered more than all of us put together will
   ever suffer! He endured the hiding of God's face and yet He lives to
   declare the faithfulness of God! He says that when He cried unto His
   Father, He heard Him.

   25. My praise shall be of You in the great congregation. It is so,
   here, this evening--Christ is praising God in this congregation! As we
   read these words of His dying testimony, we, too, are encouraged to
   believe that the God who heard Him will hear us and deliver us!

   25, 26. I will pay My vows before them that fear Him. The meek shall
   eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek Him: your
   heart shall live forever. He is talking the matter over to Himself and
   comforting Himself with the prospect of the results of His suffering.
   He sees the vast numbers of people who will be saved through His
   atoning Sacrifice, He sees the meek ones coming to His feet and He is
   happy. Because of the joy that was set before Him, He endured the
   Cross, despising the shame.

   27. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:
   and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before You. He talks
   of the LORD and He talks to the LORD--"Before You." He talks about
   God's Glory and about the salvation of the heathen, and about all
   nations worshipping the one true God.

   28-30. For the Kingdom is the LORD'S: and He rules over all the
   nations. All they that are prosperous upon earth shall eat and worship:
   all they that go down to the dust shall bow before Him: and none can
   keep alive his own soul. A posterity shall serve Him. He Himself was
   like a seed about to be put into the ground that He might bring forth
   fruit unto God-- and He cheers His heart with the prospect.

   30, 31. It shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. They shall
   come. How He rolls it like a sweet morsel under His tongue! "They shall
   come." Those great sinners, those far-off ones, "they shall come"--

   31. And shall declare His righteousness unto a people that shall be
   born, that He has done this. Or, "It is finished." There the Psalm ends
   and that was the Master's dying cry.

Repentance after Conversion

   (No. 2419)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 30, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   12, 1887.

   "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
   heart, O God, You will not despise." Psalm 51:17.

   THE French have a phrase which signifies in English, "assisting at a
   service." A person who has been present at some grand function of the
   church speaks of himself as having "assisted" at the service. I want
   that many of us should literally carry out that expression just now. I
   do not want so much to preach as to lead you in the offering of
   sacrifices. Somebody says, perhaps, "But I have no bullock, no lamb."
   No, but you have a heart--and it is a broken and a contrite heart that
   I propose that we should present to God! I will not invite those of you
   to do so who have never experienced the working of Divine Grace within
   your souls. I trust that you will be led to do so by the Spirit of God,
   but I cannot, just now, invite you to offer that sacrifice, for my
   appeal is to those who have tasted that the Lord is gracious, to those
   who have been restored from spiritual death, to those who are debtors
   to Free Grace and dying love. It is to them I speak and I invite and
   entreat them to accompany us while we present to God the sacrifices
   which He will not despise--the sacrifices of a broken spirit and a
   contrite heart.

   I would have you specially notice that in this Psalm David puts the
   sacrifice in its right position--and I would put it in the same
   position. You observe that he has, first of all, sought pardon for his
   sin and he has found it. He has prayed, "Purge me with hyssop, and I
   shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." His sin,
   then, is forgiven. He has, next, asked for a restoration of
   purity--"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit
   within me.'' That, also, has been done. I will suppose it, my dear
   Friend, to have been done in your case, also--that you have been
   renewed in the spirit of your mind by the Grace of God.

   Then, next, joy has also been restored to David, for he says, "Restore
   unto me the joy of Your salvation," so that it is not a question with
   him as to whether he is saved or not--he is a man who is saved and
   living in the assurance of salvation! Sin is pardoned and the impurity
   engendered by grievous transgression has become put away. He has peace
   with God--he is the man who brings the sacrifice. He is the man who
   presents to God a broken heart and a contrite spirit. More than that,
   he has become a preacher--his gratitude to God has led him to be useful
   to others, as he says in the 13th verse, "Then will I teach
   transgressors Your ways; and sinners shall be converted unto You." And
   even more than that, he has gone from the pulpit to the choir--he has
   become a singer and he sings a sweet song of thankfulness to the great
   God who has saved him! Now, this is the man whose lips the Lord has
   opened and whose mouth is showing forth God's praise! This is the man
   who says, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
   contrite heart, O God, You will not despise."

   Perhaps you have the notion that repentance is a thing that happens at
   the commencement of the spiritual life and has to be gotten through as
   one undergoes a certain operation--and that is an end of it. If so, you
   are greatly mistaken! Repentance lives as long as faith. Towards faith
   I might almost call it a Siamese twin. We shall need to believe and to
   repent as long as we live! Perhaps, also, you have the idea that
   repentance is a bitter thing. It is sometimes bitter--"They shall be in
   bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn,"
   but that is not the kind of repentance that I am talking of, now.
   Surely that bitterness is past, it was all over long ago. But this is a
   sweet bitterness which attends faith as long as we live--and becomes a
   source of tender joy!

   I do not know whether I shall quite convey my meaning to you, but I can
   assure you that the greatest joy I have ever known has not been when I
   have laughed, but when I have cried. The most intense happiness I have
   ever felt has not been when I have been exhilarated and full of
   spirits, but when I have leaned very low on the bosom of God and felt
   it so sweet to be so low that one could scarcely be lower and yet did
   not wish to be any higher! I quite agree with Mr. Rowland Hill, who
   said he supposed that there could be no tears of repentance in Heaven
   and that would be the only thing that he could almost regret, for sweet
   Sister Repentance is such charming company that we shall regret to part
   with her even at the gates of pearl. As we may have to part with her,
   there, I want us to keep her company all the time this service lasts!
   And my objective at this time is to ask you to bring to God, while we
   are here in this House of Prayer, the sacrifices of a broken and a
   contrite spirit. I want you to indulge yourselves in this most rare and
   exquisite delight of sorrow at the feet of Jesus--not sorrow for
   unpardoned sin, but sorrow for pardoned sin, sorrow for that which is
   done with, sorrow for that which is forgiven, sorrow for that which
   will never condemn you--for it was laid on Christ long ago and is put
   away forever! It is this sweet sorrow that I want you to indulge. Up
   with the sluices, then, Brothers and Sisters, and let these sacred
   streams of sorrow flow forth!

   I. And, first, LET US CONSIDER WHAT THIS SACRIFICE IS. It is a broken
   spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. If you and I have a broken
   spirit, all idea of our own importance is gone. What is the use of a
   broken heart? Why, much the same as the use of a broken pot, or a
   broken jug, or a broken bottle! Men throw it on the dunghill! Hence
   David says, "A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not
   despise,'' as if he felt that everybody else would despise it. Now, do
   you feel that you are of no importance? Though you know that you are a
   child of God, do you feel that you would not give a penny for yourself?
   You would not wish to claim the first place. The rear rank suits you
   best and you wonder that you are in the Lord's army in any rank at all.

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I believe that the more God uses us, the less
   we shall think of ourselves, and the more He fills us with His Spirit,
   the more will our own spirit sink within us in utter amazement that He
   should ever make use of such broken vessels as we are! Well now,
   indulge that feeling of nothingness and unimportance! Not only indulge
   it as a feeling, but go and act upon it! And be you in the midst of
   your Brothers and Sisters less than the least--humble yourselves in
   wonder that God should permit your name to stand on the roll of His
   elect at all. Admire the Grace of God to you and marvel at it in deep
   humiliation of spirit. That is part of the sacrifice that God will not
   despise!

   Next, if you and I have a broken and a contrite heart, it means that
   frivolity and trifling have gone from us. There are some who are always
   trifling with spiritual things, but he who gets a broken heart has done
   with that sort of spirit. A broken heart is serious, solemn and in
   earnest. A broken heart never tries to play any tricks with God and
   never shuffles texts as though even Scripture, itself, were meant only
   to be an opportunity for testing our wit. A broken spirit is tender,
   serious, weighed down with solemn considerations. Indulge that spirit,
   now--be solemn before God, grasp eternal things, let slip these
   shadows--what are they worth? But set your soul on things Divine and
   everlasting. Pursue that vein of thought and so bring before God a
   broken and a contrite spirit!

   Further, a broken spirit is one out of which hypocrisy has gone. That
   vessel, whole and sealed up, may contain the most precious oil of
   roses, or it may contain the foulest filth--I know not what is in it.
   But break it and you will soon see! There is no hypocrisy about a
   broken heart. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, be before men what you are
   before God! Seem to be what you really are. Make no pretences. I am
   afraid that we are all hypocrites in a measure--we both pray and preach
   above our own actual experience full often--and we, perhaps, think that
   we have more faith than we actually have and more love than we have
   ever known. The Lord make us to have a broken heart that is revealed by
   being broken! You know, now, what was in that pot, for there it lies,
   broken to shivers. Its contents are no longer concealed, they have all
   run out. Now, pour out your hearts before God as you sit there in your
   pews, and let Him see what He really does see--all that is in your
   soul--for in your hidden parts He would have you to know wisdom. Reveal
   yourselves unto yourselves and so reveal yourselves unto your God!

   Once more, a broken spirit signifies that all the secrets and essences
   of the spirit have flowed out. You remember what happened when that
   holy woman broke the alabaster box? We read that "the house was filled
   with the odor of the ointment." A broken heart cannot keep secrets! Now
   is all revealed. Now its essence goes forth. Far too much of our
   praying and of our worship is like closed-up boxes--you cannot tell
   what is in them. But it is not so with broken hearts! When broken
   hearts sing, they sing! When broken hearts groan, they groan! Broken
   hearts never play at repenting, nor play at believing. There is much of
   religion, nowadays, that is very superficial, it is all on the surface.
   A very small quantity of Gospel paint, with just a little varnish of
   profession, will go a very long way, and look very bright. But broken
   hearts are not like that--with broken hearts the hymn is a real hymn,
   the prayer is a real prayer, the hearing of sermons is earnest
   work--and the preaching of them is the hardest work of all!

   Oh, what a mercy it would be if some of you were broken all to pieces!
   There are many flowers that will never yield their perfume till they
   are bruised. Even the generous grape lets not its juice flow forth till
   it is trodden under foot of men. Breaking and bruising are fit
   treatment for the nature of men, especially for the new nature. When
   God has put sweetness into our hearts, it is then that breaking
   develops the sweetness. Oh, to worship God in spirit and in truth! One
   has well said, "No one ever worshipped God with his whole heart unless
   he worshipped him with a broken heart. And there never was a heart that
   was truly broken that did not, thereby, become a whole heart." The
   divided heart is not broken, but the broken heart is never divided. I
   know that I am talking in riddles, but the wise will understand me. To
   get unity of spirit, there must be contrition and brokenness of heart.

   II. Now, in the second place, LET US OFFER THE SACRIFICE.

   I have told you a little of what the sacrifice means, now we will try,
   as God shall help us, to bear our brokenness of heart before the Lord.
   Come, my Brothers and Sisters, let us mourn for awhile on account of
   our past sin. We will do so from several points of view.

   First, let us deeply regret that we have sinned against so good a God.
   While I regarded God as a tyrant, I thought sin a trifle. But when I
   knew Him to be my Father, then I mourned that I could ever have kicked
   against Him. When I thought that God was hard, I found it easy to sin.
   But when I found God so kind, so good, so overflowing with compassion,
   I smote upon my breast to think that I could have rebelled against One
   who loved me so and sought my good. Will you not now think of the
   goodness of God, Brothers and Sisters, and shall it not lead you to
   repentance? Shall we not feel within our hearts a burning indignation
   against sin because it is committed against so holy, so good, so
   glorious a Being as the infinitely blessed God?

   Let me help you, again, and may the arrow pierce your very hearts this
   time! Let us mourn to think that we have offended against so excellent
   and admirable a Law. If the Law of God were like the laws of men, it
   might sometimes be a virtue to break it! But where a Law is so
   balanced, so perfect, oh, how could we have run contrary to it?
   Brothers and Sisters, the Law of God, when it says to us, "You shall
   not," only sets up a danger signal to tell us where it is injurious to
   go. And when the Law says, "You shall," it does but lift up a kindly
   hand to point out to us the best and safest path. There is nothing in
   the Law of God that will rob you of happiness--it only denies you that
   which would cost you sorrow! We know that it is so and, therefore, we
   stand here and bow our head, and mourn that we should have been so
   foolish as to transgress, so willful and suicidally wicked as to do
   that evil thing which God hates and which so grievously injures us! We
   have nursed vipers when we have nursed sins! We have hatched the
   cockatrice's egg when we have thought upon iniquity! Therefore let us
   be truly sorry for our sin and for our folly.

   You remember that I am talking to those of you who are saved, to those
   of you whose sins are forgiven. In my heart, I think that I can hear
   some others say, "Will you not let us join with you in repenting though
   we are not pardoned?" Bless your hearts, yes! God help you to join with
   us and if you do, you will find pardon, too, for pardon comes in this
   way! A broken heart can never long be divided from the broken Savior.
   You shall have peace with Him when you are at war with sin. But now I
   am especially inviting the people of God to sweetly grieve in this
   House of Prayer and offer the sacrifice of a contrite heart while they
   remember that they have sinned against God's perfect Law.

   More than that--and this is a very tender point--let us grieve that we
   have sinned against a Savior's love. I like that verse we sang just
   now--

   "'Tis I have thus ungrateful been, Yet, Jesus, pity take! Oh, spare and
   pardon me, my Lord, For Your sweet mercy's sake!"

   The greatest crime that was ever committed against high Heaven was that
   crime of deicide when men nailed the Son of God to the Cross and put
   Him to death as a criminal! Where are the wretches that did this awful
   deed? They are here--I will not say that they are before us, for each
   of us harbors one of them within his bosom. "'Tis I"--"'Tis I have thus
   ungrateful been." How can I speak to you thus? Well, perhaps, all the
   better, because from my very heart I ask that we may stand together at
   the foot of the Cross and count the purple drops and say, "These have
   washed away my sins, yet I helped to spill them. Those hands, those
   feet, have saved me, yet I nailed them there. That opened side is the
   refuge of my guilty spirit, yet I made that fearful gash by my sin. It
   was my sin that slew my Savior!"

   O sin, you thrice accursed thing, away with you! Away with you! Come,
   let us be filled with mournful joy, with pleasurable sorrow, while we
   sit beneath the bloody tree and see what sin has done--and yet see how
   sin, itself, has been undone by Him who died upon the Cross on Calvary!
   Beloved, the more you love your Lord, the more you will hate sin. If
   you often sit at the table with Him and dip your hand into His dish. If
   you lean your head upon His bosom with the blessed John. If you are
   favored and indulged with the choicest brotherliness towards the
   Well-Beloved, I know that you will often find occasion to seek a quiet
   place where you may shed tears of bitter regret that you should ever
   have sinned against such a Savior as Jesus!

   Let me help you, again, however, while I remind you, Beloved, of our
   sins against the holy Spirit. Oh, what do we not owe to the Holy
   Spirit? I speak to you who know Him. It is the Holy Spirit who
   quickened you, the Holy Spirit who convinced you of sin, the Holy
   Spirit who comforted you! And oh, how sweetly does that Divine
   Comforter still comfort! Yet we resisted Him and grieved Him. Do you
   not remember, in your youthful days, how you strangled your
   convictions, how you held down conscience and would not let it reprove
   you? That blessed Spirit, whom we vexed and spurned, might have left us
   and gone His way, never to strive with us again, but He loved us so
   that He came and took up His abode with us and now He dwells in us!
   Within the narrow cell of our poor heart He has condescended to find a
   temple for His perpetual indwelling. O my Soul, how could you ever
   grieve Him? How could you ever have resisted that best and most tender
   Friend? I do not ask you to torture yourselves, but I do invite you,
   Beloved, to now indulge the joyful grief of sweet heavenly penitence as
   you remember the love of the Spirit.

   Let us go a step further and set our sin in the light of God's
   Countenance. I speak to you, Beloved, who are God's elect. He loved you
   from before the foundation of the world and yet you have sinned against
   Him. He chose you from among men, of His own Sovereign Grace, and
   ordained you to belong to Christ, and gave you to Jesus to be His
   forever! Alas, you knew it not, and you continued to sin against this
   distinguishing and discriminating Grace! Oh, that even the elect of God
   could have done this! See that you crucify the sin that suffered you to
   act so shamefully. Then in due time you were redeemed. For you,
   Beloved, Jesus shed His precious blood! He shed it not for all men, but
   with a special view to the redemption of His elect. Christ loved the
   Church and gave Himself for it. He has redeemed us from among men! We
   have been the object of that special and peculiar redemption and yet
   against that dear Christ, who loved us, and gave Himself for us, we
   rebelled and transgressed! Ordained to be of the blood royal of Heaven,
   and yet a rebel! Ordained on earth to have the love of God within our
   spirit and, in Heaven, to behold His face forever--ordained by Divine
   decree to this high destiny--and yet for many a year a rebel, a willful
   rebel against such wondrous love as this! I do not know what to say to
   myself! I despise myself, I loathe myself, that I should thus have
   acted against such extraordinary love!

   Then remember, also, that you are God's child, adopted into His family,
   His twice-born, Divinely regenerated. You are an heir of God, a joint
   heir with Jesus Christ. And yet--and yet you have acted so sinfully! O
   God, You have forgiven Your servants but we have never forgiven
   ourselves! And we never mean to--we shall always mourn, even in our joy
   for pardoned guilt, that we, the favorites of Heaven, should have so
   grieved the Lord!

   Go a little further. I want you to set sin in the light of your
   marvelous experiences. Oh, there are some of us who, without boasting,
   can tell of answered prayer when we have come back from the top of
   Carmel and we have cried, "I have won the day!" And yet to us who have
   been privileged, thus, to have power with God, it was not always so.
   Perhaps the very lips that now prevail in prayer were once habituated
   to blasphemy. Oh, mourn, my Brother, if it were so! Can you ever stop
   mourning? When John Newton wrote the Cardiphonia, or, Voice of the
   Heart--when he left us that choice treasure--I am sure that he must
   often and often have smitten upon his breast and grieved over the
   thought that he was once, in Africa, a blasphemer and everything that
   was foul and bad!

   Oh yes, wonders of Grace have been ours! Wonders of Grace! Wonders of
   Grace! We have tasted the wines on the lees well refined--yet once we
   drank of the wine of the clusters of Sodom and Gomorrah! What has Grace
   not done for us, Brothers and Sisters? You and I have been in the
   King's banqueting house and His banner of love has waved over us! And
   our Beloved has caught us away, "from the top of Amana, from the lions'
   dens, from the mountains of the leopards," and manifested His love to
   us in the secret places where no eye saw except our own and His. There
   did He reveal to us His great love! Yet we were the very ones who once
   despised Him, broke His Sabbaths, refused to read His Word, neglected
   prayer, perhaps ridiculed holy things! We were proud, covetous,
   unholy--but we are washed, we are sanctified. Oh, let us sit here and
   sweetly repent, and present to our God the sacrifices of a broken and
   contrite spirit!

   Besides, dear Friends, think of the injury you have done to others by
   your example. What a powerful preacher a mother is to her boy! What an
   influential preacher is a father to his son! What a mighty preacher one
   workmen may be to another, especially if he is a man of stronger mind
   than his fellows! Whatever any of us do, we are sure to have some who
   will copy us--it cannot be avoided. You are all writing copies every
   day, even though you are not schoolmasters and there are some who will
   learn either bad or good writing from you, for they will copy your
   handwriting. I mean, that they will imitate what they see in you. In
   years to come, when you have forgotten what you did, some may be
   following your former example. I would urge young men--and I am glad to
   see a great many of them present--to pray that they may begin life in
   such a way that they may not have much back reckoning.

   Suppose a man to be converted after his children are born. If those
   children have seen the father do wrong, they will, perhaps, remember
   the evil better than the good example of their converted father. When
   your children have once left your roof, what opportunities of
   influencing them aright you have lost! Though you may, yourselves, be
   saved by faith in Christ, yet you cannot call back the boys and the
   girls from those sinful ways into which you led them in the days of
   your ungodliness! This thought has a sharp sting in it for any who, by
   word or by example, have taught others to do that which is evil in the
   sight of the Lord. If this is your case, Beloved, while you praise God
   that He has forgiven your sin, yet mourn that you ever led any astray
   by your wrongdoing!

   If that is not enough, I want to lead you a little further and bid you
   think of all the opportunities that we lose whenever we fall into sin.
   I repent of sin unfeignedly because it has hindered my progress. I am
   now speaking only to the people of God, mark you. If any of you sinners
   want to creep in among them, you may, but I am especially addressing
   them. There is one here who, not long ago, was a pilgrim on the road to
   the Celestial City and he went part of the way up the Hill Difficulty,
   climbing splendidly on his hands and knees. He made the best of his way
   up, but it came to pass that when he had gone about half-way up the
   hill, he found a little arbor by the roadside. It was built there by
   the Lord of the Way that he might rest himself a little in it, and then
   go on his way. But this Brother sat down in the arbor and he sat on
   till he went to sleep. And he slept there, I do not know how long. Just
   lately he has been awakened and he has gone on his way, again, climbing
   up, but he has discovered that he has lost the roll that he used to
   carry in his bosom.

   It was a roll that he had when first he started at the head of the Way
   and he meant to present it to the Lord of the Celestial City when he
   came to his journey's end. But he has lost his roll. You know what Mr.
   Bunyan says of this matter. It was getting late, but Christian had lost
   his roll, so he had to go back, and he wisely went back to the place
   where he had fallen asleep--all the way moaning and sighing and crying
   to himself, "I have lost my evidences, I have lost may roll. Where
   shall I find it?" He was so glad when he looked under the bench, to see
   the roll there. I guarantee you that he quickly picked it up, put it in
   his bosom! But then, you see, he had to go over that part of the road
   three times. If he had not lost his roll and had to go back, he might,
   by that time, have been much further on the road. There were lions in
   that region and that was ugly for him. If he had got into the House
   Beautiful earlier in the day, he would not have suffered the fears he
   now had. So he went along in a very sad state of mind and all because
   of that careless sleeping in the arbor. Oh, what some of you might have
   been if it had not been for your sins since conversion! What a preacher
   I might have been! What workers in the Sunday school you might have
   been! Oh, what winners of souls you might have become by this time! But
   you have been asleep and had to go back, perhaps, and so you have
   missed many opportunities of serving Christ.

   Let us sit and think this matter over and begin to say, "Lord, we
   present to You a broken and contrite heart, mourning and lamenting, for
   if we are straitened, we are straitened in ourselves, not in You. If we
   are mourning in darkness, we, ourselves, made the darkness. If we are
   desponding, we have, in a large measure, created the despondency. Lord,
   we grieve and sorrow for all this." Since I have been in this house,
   tonight, I have heard of a dear Brother, whose prayers I remember among
   the first I heard when I came to be pastor of this Church. He passed
   away, today, and has gone to his reward, an old man and full of years.
   That Brother is where you and I will be very soon! Do not talk about
   years--they go so quickly and our friends pass away quickly, too.

   Just the other day a man of God sat at his table writing. He had dipped
   his pen in the ink, but he never laid it on the paper, for he fell
   asleep, then and there, and he was gone Home. We, too, shall soon pass
   away. "Perhaps in a few days I shall be among the angels"--say that to
   yourself, my Brother. Perhaps in a few weeks I shall behold the face of
   Him I

   love"--say that, my Sister. It will come true! Perhaps in a few
   years--no, drop the, "perhaps," and say--"Certainly, within a few
   years, I shall behold the Beatific Vision."--

   "Father I long, I faint to see

   The place of Your abode."

   I see myself walking over that street of gold that shines like glass!
   Earthly gold is dull, you cannot see into it. If you could, you would
   see the tears of the oppressed and, sometimes, the blood of crushed men
   in it. But the gold of Heaven is good and you can see into it, as you
   could into a sea of glass. I think I am walking there. I hardly know
   myself and there I meet one and another of you whom I knew, here, and
   we go together down that golden street and look in at the many
   mansions, from which come out many to welcome us, and we thread our way
   into the center. There is no temple there, no tabernacle of worship
   there, but we get into the center and we stand upon the glassy sea into
   which all the streets seem to run. And as we look around, we see angels
   and elders bowing there before the Throne of the Infinite Majesty, and
   we are there and we bow with them. And when we lift up our eyes to that
   Light, we sing, "Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
   His own blood, and has made us kings and priests unto God and His
   Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever!"

   Now I want you to think of your sins in the light of that Glory. Oh,
   how could those who are predestinated to these heavenly seats ever have
   wandered into sin? What? Was it so that we, who were born to behold the
   face of God, ever loved the theater and all its abominations? What? Did
   we, who were ordained to be peers with cherubim and seraphim, ever love
   the racetrack and all its gambling? What? Were we, whom God has made to
   be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son, ever seen to be drunk
   and staggering through the streets, defiled with unchastity, or
   polluted with gluttony, or guilty of covetousness, or cursed with
   pride? What? We whom the Lord has loved with an everlasting love and
   without whom Christ, Himself, will not be content to reign in Heaven,
   groveling in iniquity?

   Oh, I think these questions must have helped to make sin seem
   contemptible and loathsome! I point at it the finger of scorn! O dear
   children of God, scorn your sins, lament your sins, weep over your
   sins! Indulge that feeling and God will accept it when it is mixed with
   faith in His dear Son, for "the sacrifices of God," that is, all sorts
   of sacrifices put together--sin-offerings, burnt offerings,
   peace-offerings, scapegoats and all together--"the sacrifices of God
   are a broken spirit." One broken spirit is worth them all! "A broken
   and a contrite heart"--though there is but one such--"O God, You will
   not despise."

   God bless you, Beloved, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM51.

   This is a portion of Scripture which can never be read too often. If
   any among us have never found mercy, let them use this Psalm as their
   own personal prayer--while those who have found mercy can read between
   the lines and read the sweetness of pardon into the bitterness of
   sorrow for sin! This Psalm was written by David when Nathan came to him
   after his great sin with Bathsheba. He needed Nathan to come to him to
   rebuke him. If David had not been in a very sad state of heart, he
   would not have fallen into the sin. It was that state of heart which
   left him so hardened, so obdurate, that he needed Nathan pointedly to
   say to him, "You are the man." After that, he wrote and prayed this
   truly penitential Psalm.

   Verse 1. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness.
   He used to talk about being God's servant, but he says nothing about
   that, now. He used to speak of God's great love to him, but he cannot
   realize that, now. Yet he appeals to God for mercy--"Have mercy upon
   me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness."

   1. According unto the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my
   transgressions. "There they are, they stare me in the face; nobody but
   You can blot them out; do it, Lord, for Your sweet mercy's sake. Blot
   them out of existence and out of memory. And when You have blotted them
   from Your Book of Remembrance, then blot them from me, too."

   2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. "If
   washing will not do, use fire, use blood, use anything, but cleanse me
   from my sin."

   3. For I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is always before me.
   "Lord, help me. Here is my sin--I cannot shut my eyes to it. I dare not
   deny it, or excuse it. I make a clean breast of it. I acknowledge my
   transgressions and my sin is always before me."

   4. Against You, You only, have I sinned and done this evil in Your
   sight. "I have sinned against others, but this is the foulness of the
   blot, the venom of the sting, that I have sinned against my God."

   4, 5. That You might be justified when You speak, and be clear when You
   judge. Behold, I was shaped in iniquity and in sin did my mother
   conceive me. "Behold, for this is a wonder, and I look at it and I
   mourn over it. Behold, before I had a shape, I was out of shape! Before
   I saw anything, still there was sin antecedent to my very existence."

   6. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part
   You shall make me to know wisdom. "But, alas, Lord, what You desire is
   not there. In my inward part I find falsehood! In my hidden part, I
   find folly! Lord, what You desire, You must also bestow, or else I
   shall never have it! Oh, hear Your servant's supplication!"

   7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be
   whiter than snow. This is delightful pleading on David's part. He had
   seen the priest take the sprigs of hyssop, dip them in the blood and
   then sprinkle the leper. So his prayer is, "Lord, give me purification
   through the Atonement. 'Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.'"
   It requires strong faith, when under a deep sense of sin, to be quite
   sure that God can put the sin away. It is a grand thing to be able to
   say, "Wash me, foul as I am, wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."

   8. Make me to hear joy and gladness. "Lord, I have heard nothing but
   groans, lately, and I have made no sound but sighs--'Make me to hear
   joy and gladness.'"

   8. That the bones which You have broken may rejoice. When God makes us
   feel the weight of sin, it is a bone-breaking operation. He seems to
   strike as though He would kill--and only He that thus strikes can
   afterwards heal. Then He makes each fragment of the bone to sing and
   praise Him!

   9. Hide Your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. You see
   that the Psalmist has many names for sin, for evil, like a great rogue,
   has many aliases. So it is sometimes sin. Sometimes it is
   transgression, passing over the line of right. And sometimes it is
   inequity, or a departure from perfect equity. "Call it by whatever name
   it may be called, Lord, let me be rid of it. 'Hide Your face from my
   sins and blot out all my iniquities.'"

   10. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
   me. "My Creator, I am spoiled. Come and make me over again. My heart
   has grown foul. You who did make me, clean me." The watchmaker best
   cleans the watch that he made. "Create in me a clean heart, O my
   Creator, and renew a right spirit within me."

   11. Cast me not away from Your Presence. "I have acted as if You were
   not present, but, oh, do not fling me away! Do not take Your Presence
   away from me."

   11. 12. And take not Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy
   of Your salvation. "Once I was so happy. Oh, give me back my joy!"

   12. And uphold me with Your free Spirit. "I have fallen foully; let me
   not fall again. Henceforth, I cannot trust myself; You uphold me. I
   have been free to sin. Lord, send me a freer spirit, that I may be free
   to follow after righteousness."

   13. Then will I teach transgressors Your ways. He would turn preacher
   if God would but bless him! He would tell others what great things God
   had done for him.

   13. And sinners shall be converted unto You. He felt sure that if he
   once told his tale of love, others would be melted and would turn to
   God--and no doubt it was the case.

   14. Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God, God of my salvation, and
   my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness. "Once cleanse me from
   my sin and I will sing Your praises forever! And I will sing earnestly,
   too--'My tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.'"

   15. O Lord, open You my lips. He felt as if he was going too fast when
   he promised to speak and to sing, so he prayed, "O Lord, open You my
   lips"--

   15. And my mouth shall show forth Your praise. When good men have had a
   fall, they walk very tenderly afterwards. Once put them on their legs
   and they are very careful how they move. They are afraid to speak
   except as God opens their lips.

   16. For You desire not sacrifice; else would I give it. David
   remembered that under the Law there was no sacrifice appointed for the
   expiation of adultery. There were some sins that were left out of the
   catalog, and this was one of them.

   16, 17. You delight not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a
   broken spirit. Even for the man who has committed the most atrocious
   crimes, there is still acceptance if he brings God the sacrifice of a
   broken spirit!

   17, 18. A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise. Do
   good in Your good pleasure unto Zion: build, You, the walls of
   Jerusalem. Now that he feels himself forgiven, he begins to pray for
   the good estate of the Church of God and the Lord's people everywhere!
   We cannot do that when sin is breaking our bones--but when we get peace
   and rest, then the first instinct of the newborn life is to pray for
   God's Kingdom--"Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion: build, You,
   the walls of Jerusalem."

   19. Then shall You be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
   with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer
   bullocks upon Your altar.

"The King Can Do No Wrong"

   (No. 2420)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 7, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   16, 1887.

   "And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatever
   the king did pleased all the people." 2 Samuel 3:36.

   DAVID was a great king and a good king, but his character was
   compromised by the conduct of Joab, who had been one of his chief
   friends and supporters. Abner came to David, in Hebron, and proposed
   terms of peace which David accepted. But Joab could not bear that Abner
   should be his rival and, therefore, he most treacherously murdered him.
   This abominable act was greatly to the detriment of David's
   character--he could not prevent the crime, certainly he had not
   instigated it--and yet it was only natural that all the people would
   suppose that David had a hand in it because Joab was not merely one of
   his subjects, but his prime minister!

   Dear Friends, in a similar way, the character of our great Lord and
   King among the sons of men is very much in the hands of His people,
   especially in the hands of those who are more prominent than others,
   and whom He uses in His service more than others. We may go and do, on
   our own account, things that shall bring dishonor to the name of Jesus
   Christ our Lord and King! He will have no part nor lot in them, nothing
   that He has taught will suggest them, and nothing that He desires will
   urge us, thus, to act. We may, however, of our own free will, even
   those of us whom the Lord uses most, bring grievous dishonor on His
   holy name. Jesus has often to lift up His pierced hands and when we ask
   Him, "What are these wounds in Your hands?" He has to answer, "Those
   with which I was wounded in the house of My friends." It is evident to
   each one of you that all the vile insults of infidels could never
   dishonor Christ as the inconsistencies of His own disciples! No slur
   ever comparatively attaches to the glorious name of the Well-Beloved
   from His avowed enemies, let them slander Him as they may. But a blot
   does fall upon His sacred name through the inconsistencies and follies
   of those who call themselves His disciples, but who are not truly His
   followers, or, being so, are not careful to walk consistently with
   their profession!

   We may well pity David that he should come under the opprobrium of the
   conduct of such an one as Joab, for in his heart he was entirely clear
   of the murder of Abner. Yet rumor was quite sure to attribute
   complicity in the crime to him. Joab said to himself, "Abner has
   deceived the king. He cannot, after all he has done, be true in his
   professions of friendship, so I will go out and slay him." And it is
   not at all an uncommon thing for us to dishonor Christ under the notion
   that we are showing our zeal for the King. We may be doing evil in the
   hope that good may come out of it! We may be indulging an unchristian,
   intolerant spirit in our zeal against intolerance! We may grow bitter
   in our love for love and in our hate of hatred! Such poor judges are we
   of what is right that we may even deceive ourselves into the belief
   that we are honoring our Lord and Master when we are, all the while,
   bringing disgrace upon His name! Perhaps Joab acted from this spirit
   and possibly some of us, at this very moment, are making the same
   mistake.

   It is a grand proof of the stability of David's character that he did
   not suffer in the estimation of his friends because of what Joab had
   done. He ordered a public funeral for Abner. He attended it, himself,
   wrapped in sackcloth, and he compelled Joab to attend it. He, himself,
   fasted as a sign of the deepest mourning, and when the people came and
   begged him to eat, he would not touch food till the sun went down--he
   sacredly observed the time of fasting for the death of Abner, for whom
   he sang a dolorous song of real sorrow--"And the king lamented over
   Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies? Your hands were not bound,
   nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so
   fell you." "And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them:
   as whatever the king did pleased all the people. For all the people and
   all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay
   Abner, the son of Ner."

   Now, it is to the honor of our Lord Jesus Christ that His cause and His
   Character survive all the follies and all the sins of His professed
   people. There was an eminent minister who once said that Christianity
   must be true since it survived pulpits. And another one added that he
   felt more sure of its being true because it survived ministers, for,
   taking them all round, they were more likely to destroy than to build
   up the cause of Christ! These things were said only in semi-earnest,
   but there is a great deal of serious truth about them. The cause of
   Christ must be true because the Master has survived His disciples! His
   wisdom has not been eclipsed by our folly. His power has not been
   lessened by our weakness. The glory of His holiness has not been
   beclouded by the unholiness of His people. The sun has risen in spite
   of the many clouds. The morning has come notwithstanding the mists of
   the night. Blessed King, You conquer with the poorest soldiers that
   ever fought a battle and You get to Yourself the greater, rather than
   the less renown, because Your victories are won by such poor followers!

   In Christ's conquests, it is never the soldiers' battle, it is always
   the Captain's battles and the Captain's victories. On His head are the
   many crowns of all who follow Him, for there is not one of them who has
   earned a crown. Their crowns are all deserved by Him and when they are
   given to them, by Him, they naturally and of right give them back to
   Him, crying, "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and
   power: for You have created all things, and for Your pleasure they are
   and were created."--

   "Not unto us, to You alone, Blessed Lamb, be glory given!"

   So, you see, our text has already led us into this profitable
   meditation upon our Lord! Good David, with his character in jeopardy
   through the wrongdoing of his prime minister, nevertheless passed
   through the trial, and his fame survived it. And the Character of our
   Lord Jesus Christ is such that, while daily put in jeopardy by us, yet
   it will still survive and His Kingdom will continue to increase--and
   His Glory will never wane.

   This brings me, now, to dwell upon the second part of the
   verse--"Whatever the king did pleased all the people." Wherever this is
   the case with any king, we may say of it, first, this is the outflow of
   love. Secondly, this is the consequence of knowledge. Thirdly, this is
   the secret of rest. And fourthly, this is the fountain of obedience.

   I. First, then, wherever it is the case that whatever the king does
   pleases all the people, THIS IS THE OUTFLOW OF LOVE--and as it is the
   case with our King, that whatever He does pleases all His people, we
   can truly say that this is the outflow of our love to Him. Let us dwell
   upon that matter for a few minutes.

   Dear Friends, if we love the Lord Jesus Christ with all our hearts,
   whatever He does will please us! We shall sum up all His past history
   in this one sentence, "He has done all things well." And we shall
   foretell His future history just as briefly, for, "He will do all
   things well."

   Whatever our King does pleases us because we love Him and, true love,
   in the first place, banishes suspicion. When we do not love our rulers,
   we are afraid of the power that is over us. We think, perhaps, it may
   be exercised without tenderness, and we begin to tremble, lest, in some
   awful moment, the great foot should crush us, or the powerful hand
   should smite us. But when we truly love, we are not the victims of any
   such impression! No dark suspicions come across the soul that is once
   enamored of the Lord Jesus Christ. "No," says the heart, "He will not
   hurt me. He will not destroy me. He will not forget me." We cannot
   admit one ill thought concerning Him when, with all our heart, and with
   all our soul, and with all our strength, we have come to love Him. Love
   at once banishes all suspicions!

   It also inspires implicit confidence. When we love Jesus Christ, our
   blessed King, we feel that He must do that which is kind, that which is
   tender, that which is right--and we do not need to ask Him any
   questions--we leave the whole matter with Him to do as He pleases. We
   are willing to let His will be like the apocalyptic book, sealed with
   seven seals, if necessary, and we unhesitatingly say, "Let His will be
   done." He who loves Christ much does not keep on asking for tokens,
   signs, evidences and manifestations!

   That is an odd story, which is told of two Welshmen, but it has a great
   deal of truth in it. They were going out to preach and they parted at
   the crossroads, one to go this way, and one to go that. One of them
   said to his friend, "Brother Jones, may you get the Light of His
   Countenance in your preaching today!" "I hope so, Brother," he
   answered, "but there is one thing--if I do not get the Light of His
   Countenance, I will speak well of Him behind His back." Yes, just so!
   When we see His face, we realize what a blessed Christ He is, but if we
   do not see His face, we are not going to find fault with Him! We
   believe in the truth of Kent's hymn--

   "What cheering words are these!

   Their sweetness who can tell? In time, and to eternal days,

   'Tis with the righteous well.

   Well when they see His face,

   Or sink amidst the flood;

   Well in affliction's thorny maze,

   Or on the mount with God!

   'Tis well when they can sing

   As sinners bought with blood,

   And when they touch the mournful string,

   And mourn an absent God.

   'Tis well when on the mount

   They feast on dying love,

   And 'tis as well, in God's account,

   When they, the furnace pro ve."

   If Jesus smiles, He is my Lord, but if He frowns, He is my Lord just
   the same! "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." That was a
   splendid utterance of Job when he reached that point and that is where
   true love always comes--it makes no enquiries or bargains, but it says,
   "My Lord is such a glorious King that I trust Him in the dark. I make
   no covenant or stipulation as to what He will do or will not do. I
   implicitly put myself in His hands and say, 'Not as I will, but as You
   will.'" This is the sweet effect of love--it banishes suspicion and
   inspires confidence--and thus it comes true that whatever the King
   does, pleases all the people.

   Love also suggests unquestioning reverence. When you come to love your
   Lord as He ought to be loved, with a worshipping, adoring, reverential
   affection, it is almost like treason, even, to begin to enquire the
   reason for anything that He does! "It is the Lord, let Him do what
   seems good to Him." Is He not a King? Is He not my Sovereign and am I
   not only His subject, but His beloved one, and shall I begin to ask
   questions of Him as if I were a stranger and He were a tyrant? As if I
   were under a foreign rule? No, I am His Hephzibah, of whom He says, "My
   delight is in her." And He is no more to me Baali, my lord, my master,
   but Ishi, my Man, my Husband! He has given Himself that name to show
   the closeness of His relationship to me and I must not, I cannot, I
   would not desire to raise any question about anything that He does! No,
   Lord, if it were possible, I would enlarge Your liberty to do with me
   and mine whatever it pleases You. Take no notice of my whims and
   wishes, I beseech You. If you were to notice them, they might be to my
   ruin. Let Your will be my will and Your wish, my wish. I most
   reverentially yield all to You. Thus, when we come to love our Lord so
   that we give Him His right place--and we take our right place--then
   whatever the King does pleases all of us who are His people!

   Moreover, there is another beautiful feature about love, it creates
   sympathetic feeling. When we truly love Christ, our King, we are sure
   to be pleased with whatever He does. When our nature gets to be like
   His Nature--oh, what a blessed consummation that is! When our wishes
   and His wishes travel the same road, though not with equal footsteps--
   when that which He aims at is that which we aim at after our poor
   fashion--when we can say that it is more delight to us that He should
   be delighted than that we should be delighted and that it is a greater
   honor to us to see Him honored than it would be to be honored. When we
   sink ourselves in Him, even as two divided streams, at last, dissolve
   into one--as I have seen a tiny silver brook come down to Father Thames
   and pour its whole self into him so as to be no longer anything but
   part of the great river--so, when our soul yields itself up in perfect
   love to Christ, to think His thoughts, and live and move in Him so that
   it is no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us, oh, then it is
   that whatever the King does pleases all His people! Our heart has
   yielded up itself to Him and is perfectly content with that which He
   does, for it has no other will than that which lives in the Prince!
   When the Believer comes to be what he should be in the fullness of His
   love, his will is lost in the will of Christ. His very life is hidden
   away with Christ in God and then he realizes how true it is that
   whatever the King does pleases all His people!

   Thus I have shown you that, in the first place, the pleasure of the
   people in all that the King does is the outflow of love.

   II. That leads me, secondly, to notice that the love that manifests
   itself thus is not at all a foolish love, for IT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF
   KNOWLEDGE. Human love is blind, but the love which is worked in us by
   the Spirit of God is as full of eyes as are the great wheels of Divine
   Providence! There is the best of reasons why everything that Jesus does
   should please all His people--because everything He does is right--and
   we shall feel this in proportion as we combine knowledge with love, or
   our love is based on knowledge.

   First, I suppose that we know the Character of Christ. Do you know it,
   Beloved? The God-Man, your Brother, and yet the Son of God--do you know
   His infinite tenderness, His boundless compassion, His unquenchable
   ardor of affection, His unfailing wisdom? If you have a true idea of
   who the Son of God is, who is now enthroned at the right hand of the
   Father, invested with supreme power over all things and always working
   for the good of His people--if you really know Him--then, whatever He
   does will please you! One who is so wise, so kind, ought to be supreme!
   He that is so good ought to be an Autocrat and to issue decrees of His
   own! Do we not all feel that it should be so? If it were otherwise,
   then we might quarrel with Him, but such a blessed Savior as our
   Well-Beloved is, why, we will not even in thought differ from Him, but
   we will feel that whatever He does, because of His great love, must
   please us!

   Then, next, if we know Christ at all, we know something of His designs,
   and we know that He designs the Glory of the Father through the
   salvation of those the Father gave Him. He has laid Himself out to
   bring many sons to Glory. When we know that Christ's love has such
   sweet designs and that He has purchased our eternal salvation, how can
   we, after that, quarrel with Him? Now, we not only know something of
   His Character, but we also know something of His Divine intent and we,
   therefore, know that we may assuredly say, "All that You will, and all
   that You do, O our glorious King, aim only at this one thing--the
   perfecting of Your own loved ones and bringing them Home to Your Glory!
   Do as You please, for we will never raise a question with You about
   anything that You do."

   Furthermore, if we have truly become acquainted with Christ, we know
   something of His modes of operation. We have learned that it is His
   habit, often, to disguise Himself. His way is in the sea and His path
   in the great waters, and His footsteps are not known except to those
   who are familiar with Him. We also understand that the bitterness is
   given to promote our sweetness and that, oftentimes, Christ's frown is
   but a covered smile. It is the way with Him to lead His people into the
   wilderness when He means to ultimately bring them into the rest of
   Canaan. Knowing all this, let us have no altercation with our Spouse,
   our constant Friend. If all this is true, and it is, then let Him have
   His way! If this is His way of giving us superior blessedness, we will,
   without question, yield to Him, for whatever the King does, pleases all
   His people.

   Moreover, if it were not so, we know something of our Lord's rights
   and, therefore, we can never venture to interfere with His actions. Oh,
   what rights my Lord has over me! As I stand here, I confess that I am
   not my own, but that I am bought with a price. And you confess it, too,
   do you not, Beloved? Have you any rights apart from your Lord, you who
   are Christ's purchased ones? What if you are jewels? You are only
   jewels in His case. What if you have a will? It is a dangerous
   possession to have a will unless you yield it up to your Divine
   Controller. Paul said, "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus,"
   as if he had been bought in the name of Christ and branded in the name
   of Jesus with a hot iron--to be Christ's slave forever. Shall you and I
   have any will in opposition to our Lord's will? If it is His will that
   we should be poor and despised, or that we should lie sick in bed,
   shall we raise any question with Him? Let Him have His will with us,
   whatever it is!

   Some of you may remember the story Dr. Hamilton once told of a poor
   woman who said the Lord had taught her to yield herself absolutely to
   Him. She fell ill and she was bed-ridden, but she never murmured, for
   she said, "If the Lord wishes me to lie here and cough, I will lie here
   and cough. What He has done for me is so wonderful and so good that I
   cannot question His will, but I will yield myself up to Him
   altogether." "Whatever the king did pleased all the people." Yet this
   referred only to David--shall it not be so, when David's Lord is the
   King and we, redeemed with His precious blood--are the people who have
   to deal with Him?

   So, in the second place, this pleasure in the King's actions is the
   consequence of knowledge as well as the outflow of love.

   III. Thirdly, beloved Friends, THIS IS THE SECRET OF REST--"Whatever
   the king did pleased all the people." If any of you are greatly
   distressed and troubled, I believe my text indicates to you where you
   can find rest. If whatever the King does pleases you, you may let down
   the anchor, for you have come into port! You will now be perfectly
   happy. To know that the King has done it and to see His Divine hand in
   anything is more than half the battle, which ends in sweet content! If
   the Lord has done it, questions are out of the question! And truly, the
   Lord has done it. There may be a secondary agent, there probably
   is--the devil, himself, may be that secondary agent--yet the Lord has
   done it! It was God who afflicted Job, yet it was Satan who did all the
   mischief to God's servant with an evil intent. But the Patriarch could
   see God's hand in it all. So, whatever has happened to you, see the
   hand of God in it! A dog, if it is struck with a stick, bites the
   stick. Well, that may be all that we can expect from a dog, but you,
   who are no dog, must look to the hand that holds the stick, and not to
   the instrument with which you are smitten! And then you dare not bite
   the blessed hand that only intends your good in striking you. See God's
   hand, then, in all that happens to you, and that will help you on the
   way to a very blessed state of contentment.

   When you have seen God's hand, then say, "I would not have it otherwise
   than it is." I know several persons who are always in trouble and
   unhappy because there is a dispute between them and God. I remember one
   to whom I solemnly spoke, years ago, and not long after, he passed
   away. I went to see his dying child, the only one he had left, and he
   said to me, "Do not talk to my daughter about death, do not mention it
   to her." "Well, then," I said, "if I may not to mention death, I will
   not go upstairs." The father said to me, "God could not take that child
   away." He had lost several children, before, and he said that if his
   daughter died, he would call God a tyrant, and I know not what. As last
   I stood before him and I said, "You are making for yourself a rod that
   is much heavier than God, Himself, lays upon you. I fear that you will,
   yourself, die if you act in this way."

   As he could not be brought to reason, and kicked and rebelled against
   God's dealings with him, I was not surprised to learn that soon after
   his child died, he, himself, also died. It does not do to quarrel with
   God. Let the potsherds of the earth strive with other potsherds if they
   will, but woe to him who contends with his Maker! Instead of that, bow
   before Him, not simply because you must, but because you delight to
   acknowledge Him as your Lord. Are you setting yourself up as the judge
   of God? Do you dare to summon Him to your bar? Are you wiser, better,
   mightier than He? Oh, lay aside this rebellion, I beseech you! Sob if
   you will, but let it not be the sullen sob of one who will not yield,
   but that of a dear child who sobs himself asleep upon his mother's
   breast. Great God, You have done right in all that You have done! If we
   cannot prove Your wisdom, we know by faith that it is right, and we
   kiss Your hand and acknowledge that it is so with us that whatever the
   King does pleases all the people!

   Well, now, if we can get as far as that--and God grant that we may--we
   are on the road to peace! Let us come, then, to this point, and
   absolutely leave all things with Him as to the future. "Whatever the
   king did pleased all the people" and if we are willing that our King
   should go on doing as He pleases, let us leave it so. I wish that our
   whole nature would consent to God's will, not one faculty, only, but
   our whole being. Let all that God does please all of us. Yield your
   understanding, your will, your affections, your desires, your
   memory--yield yourself up fully unto the Christ who loves you--then
   shall you have perfect rest, but not till then!

   It may be, dear Friends, that some of us will soon die--let us have no
   questions about that matter--but yield ourselves to whatever the King
   pleases. Perhaps some of us may live to an extreme old age, when sight
   and hearing will fail, and it will be undesirable to survive. Let us
   raise no question whatever about that. If it is so, let it be so. I
   have heard of one good woman, a child of God, who was asked whether she
   did not wish to depart, for she was such a sufferer. Said she, "The
   Lord's will be done! I have no wish about it." "Well," said one, "but
   if the Lord would say to you that you might choose, what would you
   choose?" "Oh," she answered, "I have been so little accustomed to think
   about choosing that I should turn round and say to Him, 'Choose You,
   Lord Jesus, for me.'" Why, dear Friends, if we had to choose our own
   lot and got into trouble, we would have the responsibility of it. Is it
   not far better for us to say to the Lord, "You shall choose our
   inheritance for us"?--

   "I dare not choose my lot,

   I would not if I might!

   But You choose for me, O my God,

   So shall I walk aright."

   If we take our own way and get into difficulties, then we may say, "How
   foolish we were to make this choice!" But if, instead, we yield
   ourselves up to the supreme Director, to be led wherever He pleases,
   and follow Him as the sheep follow the shepherd, it is amazing what a
   sweet contentment our spirit will feel! The Lord bring us all to enjoy
   that rest and peace!

   IV. Lastly, THIS WILL BE A LESSON IN OBEDIENCE.

   Whatever service the King requires of you will please you. He may put
   you in a pulpit, or He may put you in a kitchen. He may put you in a
   place of honor, or He may put you in a place of dishonor. It is yours
   not to reason why, it is yours to do the work appointed! It has been
   well said that if there were two angels in Heaven and the great King
   had said to them, "I have two errands to be done upon the earth--one of
   you must go and announce the birth of Christ to the Virgin Mary. The
   other must go and stand and sweep a street-crossing." The angels would
   not have a preference between the two services, it would be enough for
   them to do their Lord's will! May we come to that point, that we may
   not be picking and choosing, but may be pleased with whatever the King
   gives us to do, and whatever our hand finds to do, may we do it with
   all our might!

   But suppose that, all of a sudden, there should be no service to be
   rendered, and that you should have to suffer, instead? That there
   should be no battle for you, Soldier, no shout of war, no noise of
   music and no rushing against the foe, but instead of that, you should
   be sent into the trenches and have to lie there in the cold and wet, or
   be ordered into a hospital and have to lie there, to go upstairs, and
   never to come down again? If we have come to this point--that whatever
   the King does pleases all the people--how readily shall we lie still
   and suffer instead of going forth to serve! If God is glorified, does
   it really matter where we are? What becomes of us is of small
   consequence compared with bringing Glory to His great name!

   Oftentimes we are permitted to work hard and yet to meet with great
   discouragement. The congregation gets smaller or grows careless. The
   district seems as if it refused to be blessed. We meet with many
   impediments in our service. Well, if they are not impediments of our
   own making, if they come in the order of Providence, let it be so and
   let us still say that whatever the King does pleases all the people! It
   was a pretty remark I read, the other day, of a Christian man who said,
   "I used to have many disappointments until I changed one letter of the
   word, and chopped it into two, so that instead of, 'disappointments,' I
   read it, 'His appointments.'" That was a wonderful change, for
   "disappointments" break your heart, but, "His appointments" you accept
   right cheerily! What if I am to have no success? I will pray for it and
   labor for it, and be ready to die for it--but if I do not get it, I
   will still go on. What said the poor Negro about obeying God's command?
   "Massa, if the good Lord bids me jump through a brick wall, it is for
   me to jump at the wall and it rests with the Lord whether I jump
   through it or not." He can make the walls vanish if it pleases Him! And
   if He desires it, I could believe, even, in the impossible! Love laughs
   at impossibilities and faith cries, "It shall be done." Therefore, let
   us pray the Lord to bring us into this happy state, that whatever He
   does may always please us.

   Perhaps some may find Christ, tonight, if they will get into the spirit
   of the text. If they will be pleased with God's way of salvation and
   come and receive Jesus, now, just as He is, and just as they are, they
   will go out of this house saved! This is, after all, only faith in one
   of its forms, this being content with Christ, this yielding up of the
   will to Him. The Lord bless everyone of you, dear Friends, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM147.

   Verse 1. Praise you the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our
   God. You that know Him, you that love Him, "praise you the Lord." "It
   is good." "It is right, it is acceptable. It is good for you--the Lord
   counts it good. "It is good to sing praises unto our God." And to God
   alone. There is no better argument for anything than that it is good,
   for good men delight in that which is good because it is good. For it
   is pleasant. That is a very happy conjunction, for it is not everything
   that is good that is pleasant, medicine to wit. It is not everything
   that is pleasant that is good, for there are some things that are
   pleasant in the mouth, but they are poison in the stomach. But to sing
   praises unto our God is both good and pleasant!

   1. And praise is comely. Or, beautiful, delightful. It is the right
   thing. Men never look so like angels as when they are praising God, and
   angels are never more heavenly than when they are engaged in the
   worship of Heaven. And that worship is praise. Here are the Psalmist's
   reasons for praising God--

   2. The LORD does build up Jerusalem. Praise Him for that. He is the
   great Builder, the Builder of the Church. He laid the foundations in
   the Everlasting Covenant. He carries on the building with infinite
   skill by His Divine Spirit-- "The Lord does build up Jerusalem."

   2. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel. These are the stones
   with which He builds, men who were like outcasts. What wonderful living
   stones these outcasts make! They love the Lord best who once were most
   His enemies. None sing of "Free Grace and dying love" with sweeter
   accents than the men who have had much forgiven. "The Lord does build
   up Jerusalem: He gathers together the outcasts of Israel." Mark the
   context between the two--it is when great sinners are saved that the
   Church is built up! There was more done when Paul was converted, I
   know, than at almost any other time, for he became the great Apostle to
   the Gentiles through whom myriads were saved.

   3. He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. To be a
   builder and a physician, too, are strange offices to be combined in
   one, yet so it is with God. Is there a broken heart, here? The Lord is
   ready to heal you! See how He does it. "He binds up their wounds"--puts
   on the strapping, wraps round the linen cloth, and secures the flesh
   until it heals. A wonderful Surgeon is the Lord God Almighty, there is
   none like He! "He heals the broken in heart and binds up their wounds."
   What a singular thing it is that the next verse should be what it is!

   4. He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by their names.
   In His condescension, stooping over a broken heart. In His Omniscience,
   counting the number of the stars! The word signifies as when a merchant
   counts his money into a bag. So does God, as it were, count the stars,
   like so many golden coins. "He calls them all by their names," as when
   the muster-roll is read and the soldier answers, "Here!" so does the
   Lord speak to the stars and they answer to their names!

   5. 6. Great is our Lord, and of great power: His understanding is
   infinite. The LORD lifts up the meek. They are down very low in their
   own estimation, but the Lord lifts them up.

   6. He casts the wicked down to the ground. The Lord is the great
   changer of men's positions--those that are up He throws down--and those
   that are down He lifts up. Thus the blessed virgin sang, "He has put
   down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree."

   7. 8. Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp
   unto our God: who covers the Heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for
   the earth, who makes grass to grow upon the mountains. This is the true
   science, this is the real philosophy--not merely the laws of nature,
   but God everywhere--God cloud-making, God rain-preparing, God clothing
   even the hilltops and out of the way places with grass which no man has
   planted and which no man will ever mow! Perhaps there is somebody here
   who, when at home, is like grass on the mountains, away from all means
   of Grace, with nobody to help you, nobody to guide you. Listen to this
   Psalm and praise the name of the Lord, "who makes grass to grow upon
   the mountains."

   9. He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
   The very best illustration of that verse is to be found, I think, in
   crows going to bed at night. You may have heard their caws. White says,
   in his Natural History of Sel-borne, that a little child said in his
   hearing, "Hark, Father, the rooks are saying their prayers." It does
   seem something like it and I believe David had heard it, and that is
   why he put it here. "The young ravens which cry," for those strange
   birds--rooks, crows, ravens and the like--even with their wild cries
   speak to God! Who can listen to the birds in the early morning without
   feeling ashamed of himself for not singing more to the praise of God?
   Some of the feathered songsters lift up their voices even in the
   night--the nightingale charms the hours of darkness--and should not we
   sing unto God when all nature rings with His praise? "He gives to the
   beast his food." Any of you who are in great distress may pray to God,
   "Lord, feed me, for You give, even, food to the beast." Do any of you
   need spiritual food? Cry to Him to feed you, for He gives even to the
   beast his food! Are you not much better than many animals? I remember
   "Father Taylor" once saying to himself, and then writing it, "I am in
   distress just now, and full of doubts: but what am I? When the great
   whale goes through the deep, the Almighty Father gives him a ton of
   herrings for his breakfast and never misses them--surely He can feed
   me." Assuredly He can! He can give to all of us all that we need.

   10. He delights not in the strength of the horse: He takes not pleasure
   in the legs of a man. As the kings did in those days, their infantry
   and their cavalry were their glory. The Lord does not care for that
   sort of thing. What gives Him pleasure, then? Listen--

   11. The LORD takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope
   in His mercy. As kings have gloried in their troops, so does God glory
   in tender hearts that fear Him and that hope in His mercy! I love that
   double description-- "them that fear Him" and, "those that hope in His
   mercy." There is a mixture there--fearing and hoping--but the mixture
   makes a sweet amalgam of Grace! It is like a fisherman's net--there is
   the lead to sink it and here are the corks to float it! If you only
   hope in His mercy, you will not come back empty from the great banquet
   of everlasting love-- "Jehovah takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in
   those that hope in His mercy."

   12, 13. Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion. For He
   has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children
   within you. Happy Zion, which God secures so well that even bars and
   posts are finished--not merely walls and gates--but the bars of the
   gates! There is nothing lacking in the Covenant of Grace. If the gates
   need bars, God thinks of the little as well as of the great--"He has
   strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children
   within you."

   14. He makes peace in your borders, and fills you with the finest of
   the wheat. An old commentator says, "Generally, if you get quantity,
   you do not get quality, but when you deal with God, 'He fills you,'
   there is quantity, 'with the finest of the wheat,' there is quality."
   You get both in God--an abundance of the best.

   15. He sends forth His command to earth: His word runs very swiftly.
   Great kings have tried to make their postal arrangements act with
   rapidity. In the olden time they employed swift dromedaries for this
   purpose, but, "His word runs very swiftly." When God has a message to
   send, He can flash it by lightning, or dispatch it in an instant by one
   of His angels--"His word runs very swiftly." I wish it would run to
   some of you who are rushing fast into sin, and that it would overtake
   you, and arrest you, and bring you to repentance and to faith in God!
   Here is a verse that may help to cool you on this summer's evening

   16. He gives snow like wool. It is as soft as wool and, like wool, it
   is a covering, and keeps the earth warm in the bitter frosts and saves
   the plants from death. "He gives snow like wool."

   16, 17. He scatters the hoar frost like ashes. He casts forth His ice
   like morsels: who can stand before His cold? I want you to notice how,
   in the olden days, good men felt God to be very near. They thought that
   all this was caused by God-- "He gives snow; He scatters hoar
   frost"--and they speak of, "His ice, His cold." It is a poor progress
   that philosophers have made, to try to get us farther off from God than
   we used to be, but I bless His name that He is as near as He ever was
   to those who believe in Him! They can see His working and feel the
   touch of His hand! But what a wonder-working God this is who uses snow
   to warm the earth and makes the frost to act like ashes--yes, who makes
   bread out of ice, for when there is no frosty weather, the harvests are
   not half as good--the very frosts break up the clods and help to create
   bread for men! The Lord works by contraries. Perhaps, at the time that
   He means to save you, you will think that He is destroying you. If He
   means to heal you, He will wound you! If He means to lift you up, He
   will throw you down! Learn to understand His method, then, for this is
   the mode of His working.

   18, 19. He sends out His word, and melts them: He causes His wind to
   blow, and the waters flow. He shows His word unto Jacob, His statutes
   and His judgments unto Israel. That is the best news of all, that God
   reveals Himself to His children! All He works in nature is eclipsed by
   what He does in Grace!

   20. He has not dealt so with any nation: and as for His judgments, they
   have not known them. Praise you the LORD.

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 14, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   19, 1887.

   "For the LORD takes pleasure in His people: He will beautify the meek
   with salvation. Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud
   upon their beds. Let the high praises of God be in their mouths and a
   two-edged sword in their hands." Psalm 149:4-6.

   I THINK I have read that, once, when the seraphic Samuel Rutherford was
   preaching, he came, before long, to speak on the high praises of the
   Lord Jesus Christ. That was a theme upon which he was at home, and when
   he reached that point, and had spoken a little upon it, the Duke of
   Argyle, who was in the congregation, cried out, "Now you are on the
   right strain, man; hold on to that!" I thought that, this morning, we,
   also, struck the right key. [See sermon #1968, Volume 38--Jubilee
   Joy--Or, Believers Joyful in Their King] We were trying to extol our
   God, our King, and to magnify His holy name and something seemed to say
   to me, "Hold on to that strain! Let us have the same note, again,
   tonight, and let us continue to laud and praise and magnify the name of
   the Most High."

   So, without further preface, I remark, first, that our text contains
   some reasons for praise. We had a great many this morning, but here are
   some more--"For the Lord takes pleasure in His people: He will beautify
   the meek with salvation." Then our text gives special phases of praise.
   It shows us how, in a peculiar manner, we may praise the Lord--"Let the
   saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the
   high praises of God be in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their
   hands." There is plenty of sea room for a preacher here, but as we have
   not much time, we will make for the nearest port and our words shall be
   as few as possible.

   I. First, here are SOME REASONS FOR PRAISE.

   The first of these reasons is the delight of God in His people--"The
   Lord takes pleasure in His people." Therefore let us praise Him! It is
   delightful that God takes pleasure in us who are His people. We feel
   that this is a great stoop of condescending Grace. What is there in us
   in which the Lord can take pleasure? Nothing, unless He has put it
   there! If He sees any beauty in us, it must be the reflection of His
   own face. Yet, the text says so and, therefore, it must be true--"The
   Lord takes pleasure in His people." In the 147th Psalm we read, "The
   Lord takes pleasure in them that fear Him." You who tremble at His
   Word, you who stand in awe of Him, you who trust Him and seek to obey
   Him--you are those that fear Him and He takes pleasure in you! He that
   is infinitely blessed--can He take pleasure in us? He that has the
   harps of angels to make music for Him, He that has the host of cherubim
   and seraphim to be His attendants, He that can make a world with a
   wish--does He deign to take pleasure in us?

   I am sure this is true, not only because it is stated, here, that the
   Lord takes pleasure in His people, but because we see this Truth of God
   in action! The Lord takes pleasure in His people's prayers. What poor
   imperfect things they are! Yet He opens His ear to hear them. He would
   sooner miss the song of a cherub than miss the prayer of a broken
   heart. He is charmed with the prayers of His people--they hold Him,
   they prevail with Him--He will do anything for those who know how to
   pray. "Prayer moves the arm that moves the world." He must take great
   delight in His people, or else He would not listen to their prayers!
   And He is pleased with their praises, too. There is never a hymn that
   is sung by a true heart but God accepts it. No one may hear it on
   earth--it may not be worth the hearing, for the sound may be
   discordant. But when a true heart seeks to praise God, He cares not for
   the vocal sounds--He has regard to the voice of the spirit's
   thanksgiving. Must He not take great pleasure in us to notice our
   praises and our prayers? Yet He does so.

   This will be still clearer to us, dear Friends, if we remember that
   while He delights to hear us praise and pray, He also speaks to us. The
   Lord has a wonderful way of revealing Himself to His people. You who
   are spiritually blind can go through this world and never see Him, but
   there are others who have had their eyes opened and they have seen the
   King in His beauty! You who are spiritually deaf can go through the
   world and never hear His voice, but they whose ears have been unstopped
   have heard Him say to them, "Seek you My face," and many a blessed word
   of promise has He spoken home to their hearts, making them glad.
   Jehovah does not shut Himself up within His palaces. The Lord Jesus
   comes forth out of the ivory palaces wherein they make Him glad, for
   His delights are with the sons of men--and He loves to commune with His
   own people as He does not with the world! Does not this show what
   pleasure He must take in us-- first to hear us speak, and then to speak
   to us, Himself?

   Beloved, you who know the Lord must feel that He never would have dealt
   with you as He has done if He had not taken great pleasure in you. Why,
   you are His children! I saw just now, from the window, a man playing
   with a child, and he seemed so happy as he tossed the little one about.
   It was but a baby, but I suppose the charm to him was that it was his
   own, and it seemed to give the father great delight. When I see a
   father playing and toying, thus, with his child, and finding joy in his
   offspring, I understand, a little, how it is that the Lord takes
   pleasure in His people. Are we not born of Him? Has He not carried and
   nursed us many a day? And does He not daily feed and supply us with all
   necessary things? Therefore, we marvel not that He takes pleasure in
   us.

   But why is this? Surely it is His own Grace that makes Him take
   pleasure in us. If you want a person to love you, be kind to him. Yet
   you may fail even then. To be certain of his love, let him be kind to
   you. A child may forget the mother--it receives much from her--but
   gratitude does not always come to her in return. But the mother never
   forgets the child to whom she has given so much! What she has given is
   a firmer bond between her and the child than ever gratitude is from the
   child to the mother. Now, God has done so much for us, already, that
   this is why He continues to love us. Jesus remembers that He died for
   us, the Holy Spirit remembers that He strove with us, the great Father
   remembers how He has preserved us--and because of all this goodness in
   the past He takes pleasure in us--

   "With joy the Father does approve

   The fruit of His eternal love;

   The Son with joy looks down, and sees

   The purchase of His agonies."

   Moreover, I think that the Lord takes pleasure in us not only because
   of all that He has done, but because He sees something in us that
   pleases Him, something which is His own work. A sculptor, when he
   commences on the marble, has only a rough block, but, after days and
   weeks of hard working, he begins to see something like the image he is
   aiming at producing. So I believe that God is pleased when He sees in
   any of us some Grace--some repentance, some faith, some beginnings of
   that sanctification--which will, one day, be perfect. You know how
   pleased you are with your children when they begin to talk, yet it is
   poor talk, is it not? It is baby talk, but you like to hear the sound
   of it! The first little sentiment that drops from the child's lips is
   nothing very remarkable, yet you tell others and brothers and sisters
   quote it as an instance of opening intelligence! So does God take
   pleasure in the tears of penitence, in the broken confession, in the
   first evidences of faith, in the trembling of hope because He has
   worked all this and He is pleased with what He has done, pleased to see
   that, so far, His handiwork has been successful!

   Besides, I believe that every true sculptor can see in the block of
   marble, the statue that he means to make. I doubt not that the artist
   could see the Laocoon of the Vatican after he had chipped for a little
   time, the figure of the serpent, and the father, and the sons all
   standing out in that wondrous group long before anybody else could see
   it. And the Lord takes pleasure in His people because He can see us as
   we shall be. "It does not yet appear what we shall be," but it does
   appear to Him! In the cast of His mind and the shaping of His eternal
   purpose He knows, dear Sister, though you are now struggling with your
   fears, what you will be when you shall stand before the blazing lamps
   of the eternal Throne of God! He knows, young man, though you have but
   a few days turned from sin and begun to struggle with vice, what you
   will be, when, with all the blood-washed host, you shall cast your
   crown before His Throne! Yes, the Lord takes delight in His people as
   knowing what they are yet to be.

   As I talk to you about God's delight in His people, I feel as if I must
   take delight in Him. I think that if the Queen were to send for you all
   to come and see her, and if you went in and out of the palace, and she
   was very pleased with you all, and showed great affection for you, you
   would be sure to have the same esteem for her. It would so completely
   win your hearts that you would not be able to help it--and you would
   not wish to do so. Now, the great King has made us His creatures, His
   favorites, yes, His sons and daughters! And He has said that we shall
   shortly be with Him enthroned above the skies and, therefore, we must
   praise Him. God forbid that we should be silent when we receive such
   love from Him! Praise Him! Praise Him, "for the Lord takes pleasure in
   His people."

   The next reason for praising God is found in the beauty He puts upon
   His people. The second part of this verse says, "He will beautify the
   meek with salvation." Great kings and princes have often tried to
   magnify themselves by beautifying their courtiers. They that stand
   nearest to thrones are expected to be bedizened after an extraordinary
   rate. Well now, our King takes the meek and lowly and He beautifies
   them with salvation! They have no beauty of their own--they do not
   think themselves beautiful, they often mourn their own deformities and
   imperfections--but the Lord is to be praised because--"He will beautify
   the meek with salvation."

   I find that, according to different interpreters, this text may be read
   in three different ways. First, as in our version, "He will beautify
   the meek with salvation." Next, "He will beautify the afflicted with
   deliverance." Hear that, you afflicted ones! Jot it down for your
   comfort. And, next, "He will beautify the meek with victory." The men
   that cannot fight shall be beautified with victory! The men that will
   not fight, the men that resist not evil, the men that yield and suffer
   in patience--the Lord will beautify them with victory! When the
   fighting men and those that stood up for their own rights will find
   themselves covered with shame, "He will beautify the meek with
   victory."

   How does God beautify those who are meek? In the Scriptures you will
   find that the most beautiful persons were the meek persons. I remember
   only three people whose faces are said to have shone--you remember
   those three, do you not? There was, first, the Lord Jesus Christ, whose
   face shone when He came down from the Mount of Transfiguration so that
   the people came running together to Him. How meek and lowly of heart
   was He! Another person whose face shone was Moses, when he came down
   from the mount of communion with God. Of him we read, "Now the man
   Moses was very meek." The third man whose face shone was Stephen, when
   he stood before the council and, in the meekest manner pleaded for his
   Lord and Master. If your face is to shine, dear Friend, you must get
   rid of a high and haughty spirit--you must be meek--for the brightness
   of the Divine Light will never rest on the forehead that flashes with
   anger. Be gentle, quiet, yielding, like your Lord, and He will then
   beautify you.

   Meekness is, itself, a beauty. We read of "the ornament of a meek and
   quiet spirit." There is many a Christian woman who has been all but
   divinely beautiful in her gentleness, bearing all sorts of
   provocation's, going about her domestic duties with great quietude. I
   am sure that I have known one or two good old Quaker ladies who looked
   to me as nearly like angels as ever mortals could be. There was about
   them a quietude of manner, a gentleness, a sort of unworldliness or
   unearthliness of beauty, though they wore no jewels and were decorated
   with no adornments that might have commended them to the taste of
   fashionable folk. The Lord gives great beauty to His people who are
   very quiet and submissive. If you can bear and forbear--if you will not
   be provoked to speak a hasty word--that meekness of yours is, itself, a
   beauty!

   Beside that, God beautifies meek people with peace. They have not to go
   and beg pardon and make up quarrels, as others have, for they have had
   no quarrel. They have not to think at night, "I really said what I
   ought not to have said," for they have not done so. There is a great
   beauty about the peace that comes of meekness!

   Another beauty which God puts on the meek is contentment. They that are
   of a quiet and gentle spirit through the Grace of God are satisfied
   with their lot. They thank God for little--they are of the mind of the
   godly woman who ate the crust of bread and drank a little water, and
   said--"What? All this, and Jesus Christ, too?" There is a great charm
   about contentment, while envy and greed are ugly things in the eyes of
   those who have anything like spiritual perception. So meekness, through
   bringing contentment, beautifies us.

   Out of meekness also comes holiness--and who has not heard of "the
   beauty of holiness"? When one is made to subdue his temper and curb his
   will, and yield his mind sweetly up to Christ, then obedience to God's
   will follows and the whole life becomes lovely! Let us praise the Lord
   that ever He put any beauty upon any of us. And let us bless God for
   the holiness of His people whenever we see it. It is a pity that there
   should be so little of it, but what a comfort it is that the Lord has
   some among His people who are of a meek and gentle spirit, whom He
   beautifies with salvation!

   Here I cannot help breaking away from my subject to tell you what
   happened to me this morning after the service was over. When I went
   into the vestry, there was a number of American friends and others
   waiting to shake hands with me. I was glad to shake hands with them.
   But there was one person present who did me more good than all the
   other Brothers and Sisters put together. He was a father and he said to
   me, "If my emotions will permit me, I would like to tell you something
   that is on my heart. I feel that I must tell it to you." This friend
   came from a distant city. He continued, "My son left my house well
   clothed and well stored with money, but for a long, long while I never
   heard from him. He plunged into all kinds of sin till he reduced
   himself, by disease, to beggary and want. He had not even shoes for his
   feet."

   As he passed by the front of the Tabernacle--(you young people, here,
   listen to this story and take home the lesson of it)--all in rags, on a
   Sunday afternoon, a young man asked him to come into one of the classes
   here and gave him a tract. He uttered an oath, threw the tract on the
   pavement, and trampled on it. After a few seconds, some sort of
   compunction seized him and he turned back and picked up the tract,
   whereupon this young Brother, quick and alert--(as I hope you young men
   and women always will be in looking after poor sinners)--spoke to him
   and said, "Oh, you have picked it up. Now will you read it?" "Yes," he
   answered, "I will read it."

   The young man then said, "Come into our class," but the poor fellow
   replied, "Look at me." "Yes," he said, "but we will not look at you if
   you will come in. They will all be glad to see you. Perhaps it may be a
   turn in your life." The young man did go into the class and he came in
   the evening to hear the sermon. They put him somewhere where people
   would not stare at him, and God blessed Him! He sought out some friends
   in London who, at first, could not believe that he was the son of this
   person. They had seen him, before, in better days, so they questioned
   him and they found that he knew so much about the father that they
   said, "Yes, no doubt you are his son." His feet were bleeding and he,
   himself, was sick, so they cared for him, clothed him and he came in
   and out of this House of Prayer, his father told me, for many months
   serving God. His father saw him and rejoiced over him!

   Now this story was told, with many tears, in the vestry behind me--told
   as I cannot tell it--and the good man invoked every blessing on me and
   upon that young Brother, whoever he may be, that brought his son in.
   "And then, Sir," said the father, "He could not find any work to do so
   he enlisted in the army, and was killed at Tel-el-Kebir." He left in
   his knapsack a letter to his father to say that he died in perfect
   peace, and that he had found the Savior at the Tabernacle. Our friend
   was so glad and I could not help telling this story because that
   Brother outside, I hope, was one of the meek ones, and God has
   beautified him by bringing that soul to Christ! And we who try to
   preach very plainly and never aim at adorning our discourses with the
   flowers of eloquence, but try to talk to people from our hearts--may
   God give us great beauty in the eyes of many when we bring their
   children or themselves to the Savior's feet! I only wish that somebody,
   like that young man, might be converted, by the Grace of God, through
   this sermon.

   I think that I have said enough upon those reasons for praise. Let us
   praise God with all our hearts and bless and magnify His name because
   He takes pleasure in His people, and because He beautifies the meek
   with salvation and, sometimes, does it by making them the means of
   salvation to others!

   II. The second portion of my sermon, which is to be concerning SPECIAL
   PHASES OF PRAISE, shall be delivered with great brevity.

   The first way of praising the Lord is by glorying in God--"Let the
   saints be joyful in glory." "That means the saints in Heaven, does it
   not?" asks somebody. No, no, no! The Psalmist is not writing for them,
   he is writing for us! "Well, but we are not in Glory," says one. I do
   not know. I think that we are. First, we are in Glory by contrast.
   Look, dear Friends, a little while ago we were in sin and we were
   condemned under sin, but now we are delivered, we are absolved from
   guilt! Surely that is like being in Glory! A little while ago we were
   cast down and troubled--and had not a ray of hope. Now we have rest in
   Christ and perfect peace. Is not that like being in Glory? Why, years
   back, when I had been preaching in Wales, I heard a Welshman cry out,
   "Gogoniant!" and others have shouted, "Glory," and I thought it was all
   right. There is enough to make the saints cry, "Glory!" to think that
   they have been redeemed from death and Hell, and that their feet have
   been taken out of the horrible pit, out of the miry clay, set upon a
   rock and their goings established! Why, truly, it is like being in
   Heaven, or Glory! Therefore, "let the saints be joyful in glory."

   Next, as we are in Glory by contrast, so we are in Glory by
   anticipation. What will Glory be? It will be a peace with God, but we
   already have that. Glory will be rest and we also have that. "We which
   have believed do enter into rest." Glory will be communion with God and
   we have that, too. "Truly, our fellowship is with the Father and with
   His Son Jesus Christ." Glory will be victory and we have that. "This is
   the victory that overcomes the world, even your faith." "But," asks
   one, "you do not mean to say that we have Heaven already?" Yes, I do.
   "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance." Are not those the Words
   of Scripture? Here is another Word of Scripture--"God has raised us up
   together, and made us sit together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."
   By anticipation and by foretaste we have already obtained life
   eternal--therefore, "let the saints be joyful in glory." Rightly do we
   sing--

   "The men of Grace ha ve found

   Glory begun below.

   Celestial fruits on earthly ground

   From faith and hope may grow.

   The hill of Sion yields

   A thousand sacred sweets

   Before we reach the heavenly fields,

   Or walk the golden streets!

   Then let our songs abound,

   And every tear be dry--

   We're marching thro'

   Immanuel's ground

   To fairer worlds on high!"

   "I cannot get up to that," says one. Try, dear Brother, try! At any
   rate, get as far as this--wherever there is Grace there will be Glory.
   Grace is the egg and glory is the hatching of it. Grace is the seed and
   glory is the plant that comes out of it. Having the egg and the seed,
   we have practically and virtually the Glory! Therefore, I say, again,
   with the Psalmist, "Let the saints be joyful in glory."

   The next special kind of praise is joy in special circumstances--"Let
   them sing aloud upon their beds." This is a message for the time of
   sickness. Praise the Lord when you are ill! Sing to His Glory when you
   cannot sleep! Sing when the head aches, for that is the highest kind of
   praise that comes out of the body that is racked with pain! "Let them
   sing aloud upon their beds." There are, sometimes, infirmities of the
   body that seem to quicken the soul. There are aches and pains that make
   us more fresh and vigorous of heart. But there are others that paralyze
   the mind and, reaching the very core of one's being, seem to freeze up
   every spring of activity. It is little wonder that under such
   infirmities the brave heart grows faint! And it is especially so when
   there is mental affliction added to the physical pain. I have known men
   of God, highly favored, and Sisters in like condition, who have walked
   in the Light as God is in the light, and have had great blessing from
   Him and, by-and-by, they have had strong inward temptation, an awful
   fight within, till sometimes they have had to cry out in their very
   souls to know whether they were with God, or God was with them at all!
   Doubts have insinuated themselves into the mind and there have been
   grave and solemn questions about matters most vital and important. And,
   at such times the man of God, though he still believes in his God and
   is obedient to the Divine will, yet feels a chill creeping over his
   very soul and he is ready to faint! Then is the time for him to sing
   aloud upon his bed, for praise to God under such circumstances will be
   especially acceptable!

   Your bed? Why, that is the place of seclusion! There you are alone.
   Have you ever felt so happy that you did not want to sleep? I have
   sometimes had such joy in the night that I have tried to keep myself
   from falling asleep lest I should miss the hallowed fellowship which my
   heart has had with God! Commune with God upon your beds and sing His
   praises, if not aloud with the voice, yet aloud with the heart!

   Upon your bed? Why, that is the place of domestic gathering, for the
   bed here meant is a couch on which the Orientals reclined when they
   ate. Sing the Lord's praises on your couches--that is, when you gather
   with your families. "Praise you the Lord: sing aloud upon your
   couches." I wish we had more family singing--we ought to have more.
   Matthew Henry says, with regard to family prayer, "They that pray every
   night and morning do well. They that pray and read the Scriptures do
   better. They that pray and read the scriptures and sing, do best of
   all." And so say I--that is the best of all family worship! Let us take
   care, in our domestic relationships, that we praise this blessed God
   who is the God of our households as well as the God of our sanctuaries!

   Upon their beds? Why, that means the bed of death! We shall soon go
   upstairs and gather up our feet in the bed. Oh, then, you dear children
   of God, praise Him aloud upon your beds! I believe that the sweetest
   praises ever heard on earth have cone from lips that were just closing
   in the silence of the tomb--

   "I will love You in life, I will love You in death, And praise You as
   long as You lend me breathe. And say when the death-dew lies cold on my
   brow,

   If ever I loved You, my Jesus, 'tis now." Always praise Him! Always
   praise Him! When nobody hears you, in the silence of your bedchamber,
   still sing aloud unto your God!

   We must press on, though we have not time for much that ought to be
   said. The next special phase of praise is elevation in song. The sixth
   verse says, "Let the high praises of God be in their mouth." As I told
   you when I read the Psalm, [Exposition at the end of the sermon--ED.]
   it is "in their throat" in the Hebrew, for God's people sing from their
   hearts and so they are a deep-throated people who do not merely
   sibilate praise with the lips, but send it up from the depths of their
   soul!

   What does the Psalmist say? "Let the high praises of God be in their
   throats." Our praises ought to be very high praises, for there is a
   high objective before us. We praise a great God! We should, therefore,
   praise Him with high feelings, feelings wound up to the highest point
   of high delight and high desire! Our praises should climb up to
   Heaven's gate--running up Jacob's ladder even as the angels did--till
   we cast our praises right at the foot of the eternal Throne of God. Let
   us sound forth the high praises of God with our mouths! Let us extol
   Him, magnify Him and make Him great! Say noble things of God wherever
   you go, for He well deserves it at your hands.

   The last phase of praise concerns courage in conflict--"and a two-edged
   sword in their hands." Songs in their mouths and swords in their hands!
   It is something like the sword and the trowel--the trowel to build with
   and the sword to smite with. God's people must sing and fight at the
   same time--and they fight best who sing best. Not those that growl
   best, but those that sing best, fight best

   But with whom are we to fight? That depends upon what your sword is. If
   you had a sword of steel, you would fight with men--but that is no part
   of your business. You are not called to that cruel work, but, as you
   have the sword of the Spirit, which is two-edged, which is, indeed, all
   edge, for it cuts whichever way you turn it, go forth and praise God by
   the use of that two-edged sword which is the Word of God!

   Let me stir up God's people here to do this. Go and proclaim the
   Gospel! Proclaim the Gospel. I think I have, to a large extent,
   attained my wish in this congregation. I miss such a large number of
   our friends on Sunday nights and I am delighted to miss them, for they
   have no business to be here, then! They are out preaching, teaching,
   working in Ragged-Schools, mission halls and all sorts of holy service.
   That is what you ought to do if you love the Lord--get a good meal,
   once, on the Sabbath, and then go and do a good day's work the rest of
   the Sunday! Praise God with your mouths and have the two-edged sword in
   your hands! To war against ignorance, to war against vice, to war
   against drunkenness, to war against infidelity and sin of every kind is
   one of the best ways of praising the Most High! Until the last sinner
   is saved, see to it that you keep the two-edged sword of God's Word in
   your hands and then forever let the high praises of God be in your
   mouth!

   I have been talking all this while about praising God and there are
   some here who never praised Him in all their lives! What wretched
   creatures you are! God has been blessing you all this while and you
   have never praised Him. I have seen hogs under an oak munching
   acorns--how they enjoy themselves! They never stop to thank the
   oak--such a thought never enters into their swinish heads. Do not blame
   the swine, but think of the numbers of men who are worse than they are!
   God is to them far more than the oak is to the animals. All things come
   of Him--their health, their strength, their daily comforts--and yet
   they never thank Him! Have you some little chickens at home? Let them
   chide you! Whenever the chick stoops down to the saucer to drink a
   little water, up goes its head as if to thank God for every drop! Oh,
   begin to praise God! Begin to thank God at once!

   Perhaps this may be the beginning of something better, for when you
   have begun to praise Him, you may begin to dispraise yourself--and that
   is next door to feeling your sinfulness, which will lead you to seek
   the Savior! And if you seek Him, He will be found of you. Seek Him now,
   this summer's night, while all God's bounty is being poured upon the
   earth to make it fertile! Oh, that He might pour some heavenly beams on
   you to make you fruitful to His praise! May He do it and to His name
   shall be glory, world without end! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALMS 149; 150.

   The whole Book of Psalms is full of praise, but the praise culminates
   at the close. There are five "Hallelujah Psalms" at the end of the
   Book. They are so named because they both begin and conclude with the
   word, Hallelujah, "Praise you the Lord." It must be to the intense
   regret of all reverent persons to find the word, Hallelujah, so used
   today in such a way that it is made to be a commonplace instead of a
   very sacred word--Hallelujah, or, Praise be unto Jah, Jehovah! He who
   uses this word in a flippant manner is guilty of taking the name of the
   Lord in vain!

   Psalm 149:1. Praise you the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song. You
   have had new mercies from the Lord-- give Him, in return, a new song!
   You have a new apprehension of His mercy. You who live under this
   Gospel dispensation have something more to sing of than even David
   experienced! Therefore, "sing unto Jehovah a new song"--throw your
   hearts into it! Do not let it be a matter of routine, but let your
   whole soul, in all its vigor and freshness, address itself to the
   praise of God!

   1. And His praise in the congregation of saints. All saints praise
   God--they are not saints if they do not. The praise of any one saint is
   sweet to Him, but in the congregation of saints there is a linked
   sweetness, a wonderful commixture of precious things. Sing His praise,
   then, in the congregation of His holy ones.

   2. Let Israel rejoice in Him that made him. Adore your Creator for your
   being and for your well-being. He has twice made you, you people of
   God! Give Him, therefore, double praise--not only the song of those who
   sang when creation's work was done, but the praise of those who sing
   because they are made new creatures in Christ Jesus!

   2. 3. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. Let them praise
   His name in the dance. The holy dance of those days differed altogether
   from the frivolous and lascivious dances of the present time. It was a
   sacred exercise in which the whole body expressed its delight before
   God.

   3. Let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp. The one to
   be struck and the other to be gently touched to yield its stringed
   sweetness.

   4. For the LORD takes pleasure in His people. Should not they take
   pleasure in the condescension on His part to take any pleasure in them?
   Oh, what a lift up it is for us when we learn to take pleasure in the
   Lord!

   4. He will beautify the meek with salvation. He dresses all His
   children, but the meek are His Josephs, and upon them He puts the coat
   of many colors. And they shall inherit the earth.

   5. Let the saints be joyful in glory. God is their glory! Let them be
   joyful in Him.

   5. Let them sing aloud upon their beds. If they cannot come up to the
   congregation, yet, when they rest at home, or when they suffer at home,
   let them not cease from their music. God's praise comes up sweetly, I
   do not doubt, this Sabbath evening, from many a lonely chamber where
   the saints are waiting for the appearing of their Lord.

   6. Let the high praises of God be in their mouths. "In their throats,"
   says the Hebrew, for God's saints sing deep down in their throats.
   There is a deeply rooted music when we praise God, which is altogether
   unlike the mere syllables of the lips that come from a hypocrite's
   tongue.

   6. And a two-edged sword in their hands. For we have to fight, today,
   with principalities, and powers, and wickednesses everywhere! With the
   sword of the Spirit in our hands, we fight the battles of the Prince of
   Peace!

   7, 8. To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
   people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
   of iron. So was it when Israel came into Canaan, ordained to execute
   the vengeance of God upon the heathen nations. We have no such warrant
   and no such painful duty--but there is a prince who shall be bound with
   chains and with fetters of iron one day. The Lord shall bruise Satan
   under our feet shortly and, meanwhile, we fight against the powers of
   evil of every kind. Oh, that God would help us to bind King Drunkenness
   with chains and King Infidelity with fetters of iron! Would God the day
   were come when impurity, which defiles so many, were overcome and
   vanquished by the two-edged sword of the Spirit of God!

   9. To execute upon them the judgment written: this honor have all His
   saints. Or it may be read, "He is the honor of all His saints." "Unto
   you that believe He is precious," or, "He is an honor," says the
   Apostle, and there is no honor like that which comes of being coupled
   with God, living in Him, and living for Him!

   9. Praise you the LORD. What bursts of praise must have risen from the
   hosts of Israel when they gathered for their annual festivals and sang
   together these last great Hallelujah Psalms!

   Psalm 150:1. Praise you the LORD. Praise God in His sanctuary. Notice
   how, in this last Psalm, it is praise, praise, praise, all the way
   through! I think we have the word, "praise," some 13 times in the six
   verses. It is all. "praise Him,

   praise Him, praise Him." It is not enough to do it once, or twice, we
   should keep on praising the Lord till we should make the very heavens
   ring with the music of His praises! "Praise you the Lord. Praise God in
   His sanctuary." That is, in His Holy Place where He dwells. Begin, you
   angels, cherubim and seraphim--pour forth His praise!

   1. Praise Him in the firmament of His power. Let every star shine forth
   His praises, and sun and moon cease not to extol Him--"Praise Him in
   the firmament of His power."

   2. Praise Him for His mighty acts: praise Him according to His
   excellent greatness. There is a task for us--we shall never attain to
   that height. We sometimes sing--

   "Wide as His vast dominion lies, Make the Creator's name be known!

   Loud as His thunder shout His praise, And sound it lofty as His
   Throne." But who can compass such a feat as that?

   3. 4. Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet: praise Him with the
   psaltery and harp. Praise Him with the timbrel and dance: praise Him
   with stringed instruments and organs. So that there were all kinds of
   music in those days praising God--the wind and the stringed
   instruments, the timbrel and the pipe. Everything that can praise God
   should praise Him. The spiritual significance of these verses is
   this--let men of different orders and different sorts praise the Lord--
   men, women, children, those who are deeply taught and those who know
   but little, those who are great and those who are small. Let every
   heart regard itself as an instrument of praise and use itself wholly
   for the Lord's praise. Having gotten so far, the Psalmist remembered
   that there were discs of brass, which were struck together, and gave
   forth a sound to be heard at a great distance, so He said--

   5. Praise Him upon the loud cymbals. Crash!

   5. Praise Him upon the high sounding cymbals. Then came another crash!

   6. Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise you the LORD.
   A Jewish Rabbi once remarked to me that the name, Jehovah, was not made
   up of letters, but only of a series of breaths. [The preacher here
   uttered the three syllables of the sacred name, Je-ho-vah, as though
   they were not composed of letters, but only a succession of breaths.]
   That is the nearest approach to the name of God, three
   breaths--therefore since all breath comes from Him--and His very name
   can only be pronounced by breath, "Let everything that has breath
   praise the Lord. Praise you the Lord." Hallelujah!

"There Is Forgiveness"

   (No. 2422)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 21, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   23, 1887.

   "But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared." Psalm
   130:4.

   HAVE you noticed the verse which comes before the text? It runs thus,
   "If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?" That
   is a confession. Now, confession must always come before absolution.
   "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins." If we try to cloak our sin, "if we say that we have no sin, we
   deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us," and no pardon can come
   from God to us. Therefore, plead guilty, plead guilty! You ought to do
   it, for you are guilty. You will find it wisest to do it, for this is
   the only way to obtain mercy. Cast yourself upon the mercy of your
   Judge and you shall find mercy--but first acknowledge that you need
   mercy. Be honest with your conscience and honest with your God--confess
   the iniquity which you have done and mourn over the righteousness to
   which you have not attained.

   You notice that this confession is recorded with a kind of grave
   astonishment--"If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
   stand?" This is as much as for the Psalmist to say, "I am sure that I
   cannot, and who can?" And, my dear Brothers and Sisters, if God shall
   deal with us according to our iniquities, where shall we stand, and who
   among us shall stand anywhere? I dare not stand to preach if God shall
   judge me according to my iniquities! You dare not stand to sing--what
   have you to do with singing if God is marking your iniquities? I wonder
   that men can stand at their counters and stand at their work while
   their sin is unforgiven! And then how shall we stand in the Day of
   Judgment? The best saint on earth, if he stands in his own
   righteousness, alone, and is judged according to his own offenses, why,
   the Justice of God will blow him away like the chaff, or consume him as
   with a flame of fire! "If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord,
   who shall stand?"

   It is a dreadful fact that this, "if," is no, "if," to those who are
   not believers in Christ, but it is a matter of terrible certainty! God
   marks the iniquities of you who are unbelievers. Although as yet He
   does not visit them upon you, else you could not stand, yet He sees
   them and He records them! As gold and silver are put into a bag and
   sealed up, so are your iniquities. All the transgressions of your past
   life are in the Book of Record, from which they can never be blotted
   out except by one gracious hand! Would to God that you would accept
   pardon from that pierced hand! But, apart from that, your iniquities
   are engraved as in eternal brass! And in that day when the forgotten
   things shall be brought to light, all the sins that now lie at the
   bottom of the sea of time shall be cast up upon the shore and all shall
   be seen. And every secret thing shall be set in the light of day, and
   every transgression and iniquity shall be revealed by the light of the
   Great White Throne--and the ungodly shall be punished for all their
   ungodly words and ungodly deeds and ungodly thoughts according to the
   rules of equity in that last day of assize!

   O Sirs, God will mark iniquity and then, whoever is out of Christ shall
   be able to stand! Whoever has never hidden in the riven Rock of Ages
   shall find no shelter! No, shall they not all cry to the mountains to
   fall upon them, to hide them from the dreadful face of Him who shall
   sit upon the Throne of God? Even at this time there are some in this
   House of Prayer whose sins are lying upon them and whose transgressions
   are written in God's Book of Remembrance! How can they dare to stand,
   even, before a Throne of Grace, and how will they stand before the
   Throne of Judgment?

   That third verse makes an appropriate preface to my text--it is the
   black thundercloud upon which I see written, as with the finger of God
   and with a lightning flash, the wonderful words we are now to consider,
   "But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared."

   I. My first head is taken from the first word of the text--"But." Here
   is A WHISPER OF HOPE. "If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord,
   who shall stand? But"--Oh, the sweet music of that little word! It
   seems to come in when the terrible drum of alarm is being beaten and
   the dreadful clarion of judgment is sounding forth! There is a pause
   with this word, "But there is forgiveness.''" It is a soft and gentle
   whisper from the lips of Love--"But there is forgiveness."

   This comes into the soul after a full confession of sin. When you have
   knelt down before God and acknowledged your transgressions and your
   shortcomings, and your heart is heavy, and your soul is ready to burst
   with inward anguish, then may you hear this gracious Word of God, "But
   there is forgiveness." When, under a sense of sin, it seems as if the
   very fiends of Hell were shrieking in your ears because of the awful
   doom which is drawing near--when you shall be driven from hope and from
   the Presence of God, then, when you fall on your face in the terror of
   your soul because of your iniquity, then comes this sweet Word of
   God--"But there is forgiveness." It is all true which your conscience
   tells you. It is all true which the Word of God threatens concerning
   you! Then acknowledge that it is true and bow yourself in the dust
   before God--and then you shall hear in your soul, not only in your
   ears, but in your heart, this blessed Word of God, "But there is
   forgiveness."

   Some of us remember when we first heard this Word. When it came, it was
   to us like the clear shining after rain-- "But there is forgiveness."
   Some of us were, perhaps, for weeks and months without any knowledge of
   this blessed Truth of God--pining for it, hungering for it--and when
   the Lord brought it home with power into our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
   oh, there was no music like it! Angels could not sing any tune so sweet
   as these Words of God spoken to our hearts by the Holy Spirit, "But
   there is forgiveness." Go your way, my Hearer, and confess before God
   all your sin! I will not say what it has been. Perhaps you have lived
   for many years in the pursuit of sinful pleasures. Perhaps you have
   been dominated by your own will--you have tried to be lord and master,
   or queen and mistress of your own wicked spirit. And, perhaps, you have
   done evil as often as you could, and you are sensible of your sin, and
   your wounds bleed before God because of it. Well, then, in comes this
   whisper of hope--"But there is forgiveness." God make it as sweet to
   you to hear it as it is to me to tell of it!

   This whisper of hope sometimes comes to the soul by the Spirit of God
   as the result of observation. A man, full of sin, thinks to himself,
   "Well, but others, also, have been full of sin, yet they have been
   forgiven. What if I have been a blasphemer and injurious? Yet so was
   Saul of Tarsus and he had forgiveness from the Lord. What if I have
   been a thief? Yet so was he who hung upon the cross, and that day was
   with his Lord in Paradise. What if I have been a fallen woman, and have
   been defiled with sin? Yet there is forgiveness, for she was forgiven
   who was a sinner, and came and washed Christ's feet with her tears, and
   wiped them with the hairs of her head, loving much because she had much
   forgiven. What, even if I have been an adulterer? Yet such was David.
   What if I have been a persecutor? Yet such was Manasseh. Into whatever
   sin I may have fallen, I observe that others like I have been snatched
   from these horrible pits--and why should not I be?"

   1 would whisper this message into the ear of anybody here who is
   conscious of sin. If you will but look about you, you will see others
   like yourself who have been washed, cleansed and sanctified. Some of
   them are on earth, and many more of them are in Heaven, who have washed
   their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb! Sweet, then,
   is this whisper of hope arising out of observation of others--"But
   there is forgiveness."

   This whisper also comes in opposition to the voice of despair, for
   despair says to a soul under a sense of sin, "There is no mercy for
   you! You have sinned beyond all limits. Your death warrant is signed,
   the verdict has been given against you, there remains nothing for you
   but everlasting burnings!" No, Soul, God's Word against your word any
   day! God's Word says, "There is forgiveness," Nothing can destroy
   despair except a message from God, Himself, and this passage is like a
   huge hammer to break in sunder the gates of brass and dash in pieces
   the bars of iron--"There is forgiveness." "All manner of blasphemy
   shall be forgiven unto men." In the greatness of His heart, Jehovah
   declares that He delights in mercy, and this is the song which went up
   to Him in the old Jewish Church with many a repetition, and is just as
   true today--

   "For His mercies shall endure, Ever faithful, ever sure! He His chosen
   race did bless In the wasteful wilderness. For His mercies shall
   endure,

   Ever faithful, ever sure He has, with a piteous eye, Looked upon our
   misery! For His mercies shall endure, Ever faithful, ever sure."

   You have not gone beyond His mercy! You cannot go beyond His mercy if
   you will trust His Son! "There is forgiveness." Let this whisper drive
   away despair! What a blessed whisper it is! "There is forgiveness."
   "There is forgiveness." Let it enter your soul and drive those grim
   ogres and hobgoblins of despair away into the sea of forgetfulness.
   "There is forgiveness."

   This whisper of hope is, further, the answer to conscience. When Mr.
   Conscience is really at work, he has a very terrible voice. There is no
   lion in the thicket that roars like a truly awakened conscience.
   Conscience says, "You knew your duty, but you did not do it. You have
   sinned away many a day of Grace--you have refused Gospel invitations,
   you have striven against the light of nature and the Light of God--you
   will go down to Hell well deserving your doom! When the millstone is
   about your neck, to sink you into the abyss, you will deserve to have
   it so, for you have earned all this for yourself by your iniquities." I
   will not seek to stifle conscience, nor ask you to shut your ear to his
   voice. Let him speak, but still, do you not hear between his roars this
   sweet note as of a silver harp, "But-but-but-but there is forgiveness"?
   O conscience, there is forgiveness! I am as guilty as you say I am, and
   much more, for you cannot see all the sin that I have committed--"but
   there is forgiveness."

   Let me go still further and say that this whisper of hope is an answer,
   even, to the Law of God. The Ten Commandments are like ten great
   cannons fully charged and if we were, like the rebels in India, tied to
   the muzzles of them and blown to pieces, it would be only what we
   deserve! But just when the fuse is lighted and about to be applied,
   there rings out this blessed Word of God, "There is forgiveness. There
   is forgiveness." The Law says, "The soul that sins, it shall die," and
   the Law knows no mercy--it cannot know any mercy. Sinai has never yet
   yielded one drop of water to cool the parched tongue of a guilty
   sinner! Never did a shower reach its craggy peaks! It is a mountain of
   fire and the thunder rolls over its summit with the sound of a trumpet
   exceedingly loud and long, making all who hear it to tremble!

   God, when He comes to judge, must judge according to
   justice--"but-but-but-but there is forgiveness"! There is another
   mountain besides Sinai--you have not come unto Mount Sinai--but you
   have come unto Mount Zion! There is another Lawgiver besides Moses!
   There is Jesus, the Son of God! There is another Covenant besides the
   Covenant of Works--there is a Covenant of rich, free, Sovereign Grace,
   and this is the essence of it--"There is forgiveness." Oh, that I could
   convey that whisper into the ear of every sinner who is here! I can do
   that, but oh, that God the Holy Spirit would put it into your heart,
   that you might never forget, "There is forgiveness"!

   II. Now I advance to my second division. In our text I see, besides the
   whisper of hope, AN ASSURANCE OF THE WORD OF GOD--

   "There is forgiveness with You."

   Dear Friends, "there is forgiveness." Nature could never tell you this
   great Truth of God. You may walk the cornfields at this moment and see
   the bounty of God in the waving grain, but you cannot read forgiveness
   there. You may climb the hills and see the beauty of the landscape. You
   may look upon silver streams that make glad the fields, but you cannot
   read forgiveness there. You can see the goodness of God to man, but not
   the mercy of God to sinners! But if you come to this Book, you can read
   it here.

   Turn to the Old Testament and you will see that it reveals
   sacrifice--lambs, bullocks and goats. What did they all mean? They
   meant that there was a way of pardon through the shedding of
   blood--they taught men this, that God would accept certain sacrifices
   on their behalf. Then turn to the New Testament and there you will see
   it revealed more clearly that God has accepted a Sacrifice, the
   Sacrifice which He, Himself, gave, for, "He spared not His own Son, but
   delivered Him up for us all." In this Book you read how He can be
   "just, and the Justifier of him that believes." How He can be a just
   God and yet a Savior. How He can forgive and yet be just as righteous
   as if He punished and showed no mercy. This, in fact, is the Revelation
   of the Gospel! This is what this Book was written to teach, to tell you
   that, "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not
   imputing their trespasses unto them." Therefore we come to you, not
   merely with a hopeful whisper, but with a full, distinct, emphatic,
   unquestionable assurance--"There is forgiveness." "There is
   forgiveness."

   Turn to this Word of God and you will find the certainty of
   forgiveness. "I believe in the forgiveness of sins." What a grand
   article of the creed that is! Do you believe it? Then do not doubt, do
   not hesitate--"There is forgiveness." You must know that there is such
   a thing, or else you will not be eager to seek for it! It is in vain to
   go in quest of a myth or a perhaps--but here is a certainty for you.
   "There is forgiveness." Doubt it not! Believe it to be so and then seek
   after it with all your heart. "There is forgiveness." That is a matter
   of certainty.

   Notice, if you please, the broad indefiniteness of the text--"There is
   forgiveness." It does not say, "There is forgiveness for this sin or
   for that," but, "There is forgiveness." Where God draws no limit, do
   not you draw any! If God sets the door wide open and says, "There is
   forgiveness," then come along, you sinners, whoever you may be, from
   jails and penitentiaries! Come along from your Pharisaic places of
   boasting and self-righteousness! Come along with you, for there is
   forgiveness even for you! You rich, you poor, you learned, you ignorant
   that know nothing, know at least this-- "There is forgiveness." This
   text shuts out nobody! I bless God, sometimes, for the grand vagueness
   of His speech. When He draws lines of distinction, as sometimes He
   does, then are we anxious to know who is shut in and who is shut out.
   But when He simply says, "There is forgiveness," let us jump at it and
   grasp it by an act of faith and, once let us but grasp it, He will
   never take it from us, for Jesus Himself said, "Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out."

   Notice, too, the immediate presentness of the text. Our version has it,
   "There is forgiveness," but there is no verb in the Hebrew. The
   translators put in the words, "There is," so we are to read it, "There
   was forgiveness." "There is forgiveness." "There will be forgiveness as
   long as life lasts." But I like it as it stands here. "There is
   forgiveness" tonight. "There is forgiveness" now. "There is
   forgiveness" where you sit, just as you are, just now! Oh, that I could
   say it so as to convince you of the truth of it, and give a grip, a
   squeeze of my right hand, to each one of you! I would like to do it! O
   my dear Friends, do not despair, do not be bowed down any longer,
   "there is forgiveness." There is forgiveness now!

   And it is intended to have a personality about it. It is no use telling
   anybody that there is forgiveness for other people, but none for him.
   This text is made for you, dear Friends, and the preacher is sent to
   proclaim this Truth of God to you, for he is sent to preach, as far as
   he can, to every creature under Heaven. "There is forgiveness" for you,
   though you think there is none! Your thoughts are not as God's
   thoughts--neither are your ways as His ways. There is, there surely is,
   at this moment, forgiveness! Oh, that you would prove it by an act of
   faith! The moment you believe in Christ, your sins are all forgiven!
   Look to Him whom I would hold up before you, as Moses held up the
   brazen serpent on the pole! Look, for there is life in a look to Him
   that died for guilty men--

   "There is life for look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for thee. Then look, sinner--look unto Him, and be saved-- Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree."

   May this be the moment when the Spirit of God shall make it to be so to
   many here present! "There is forgiveness."

   III. Now I must go a little farther and notice, in the text, A
   DIRECTION OF WISDOM--"There is forgiveness with You." "With You."

   Do you hear this, dear Heart? You are shrinking from your God. You are
   anxious to run away from Him--but that is where the forgiveness
   is--with God! Where the offense went, from that very place the
   forgiveness comes--"There is forgiveness with You." "Against You, You
   only, have I sinned," but, "there is forgiveness with You," with the
   very God whom you have offended! It is with God in such a way that it
   is part of His Nature. "He delights in mercy." "God is Love." He
   glorifies Himself by passing by transgression, iniquity and sin. There
   is forgiveness with God. It is in God's very Nature that it lies. Fly
   not away, then, from the very place where forgiveness awaits you!

   "There is forgiveness with You." Some read the passage, "There is a
   propitiation with You." Now, the Lord Jesus Christ is that
   Propitiation, and He is with God. He has gone up into Glory and He is
   at the right hand of the Father even now. Make your way to God, for the
   Propitiation is there before you! Meet your God at the Mercy Seat lest
   you have to meet Him at the Judgement Seat! There is forgiveness always
   with God, for Jesus is always there. Therefore, go to Him and find it.

   "There is forgiveness with You," that is to say, God has it in His
   immediate gift. He will not have to hunt for it, for it is with Him, He
   has it ready to bestow! He will not need you to plead for it with so
   many sighs, cries and tears, but He has it waiting for you. The writ by
   which you shall be set free is already made out! "There is forgiveness
   with You." The

   Lord Jehovah has signed you free pardon, it lies before Him now--go and
   take it! "There is forgiveness with You," immediately, and if you do
   but believe in Jesus, you shall receive it from His hand!

   "There is forgiveness with You." Then, depend upon it, there is a way
   for forgiveness to get to me, for if God has it, He can somehow get to
   me with it! I may be far off from hope. I may be surrounded, as it
   were, with brick walls, shut in like a man in one of the dungeons of
   the Bastille, where men lay till they were forgotten and the very
   jailer did not know who they were, nor when they came there. If you are
   even in such a sad state as that, God can get at you--there is
   forgiveness with Him--and He can get it to you!

   And if it is with God, then there is a way for you to get to it, for
   there is One come who stands between you and God! There is a Mediator
   between God and men, the Man, Christ Jesus--but you do not need a
   mediator between Christ and yourself--you can come to Him just as you
   are! You need a Mediator with God and there is Jesus Christ, who is God
   and Man, able to lay His hands both on you and on your gracious God,
   and to bring you into His Presence!

   I feel somehow certain that I am going to have some souls, tonight, to
   be my reward. I love to ring those charming bells, "Free Grace and
   dying love." A great part of the pleasure of preaching is derived from
   the fact that I know that God's Word will not return to Him void, but
   that some who hear the Gospel message will receive it and be saved!
   Listen to this Word of God, you doubting, trembling, despairing
   sinner--"there is forgiveness"--that forgiveness is with God! If I told
   you that it was with me and that I was the priest, perhaps you would be
   foolish enough to believe me. But I will tell you no such lie! It is
   not with any priest on earth--it is with the Lord! "There is
   forgiveness with You," and you may go to God just as you are, with
   nothing in you hands, and cast yourself at His feet, quoting the name
   of His dear Son. Rest there and the work is done, for, as God lives, it
   is true, that there is forgiveness with Him that He may be feared!

   IV. I close with this word. The last part of the text shows A DESIGN OF
   LOVE--"There is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared."

   Somebody said, "I should have thought that it would have read, "that
   You may be loved." Yes, so I would have thought, but then, you see,
   fear, especially in the Old Testament, includes love! It includes every
   holy feeling of reverence, worship and obedience towards God. That is
   the Old Testament name for true religion--"the fear of God." So I might
   say that the text declares, "There is forgiveness with You, that You
   may be loved, worshipped and served." Still, even in the sense of fear,
   it is a most blessed fact that they who fear the Lord are delightful to
   Him. "The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope
   in His mercy."

   Do you not see how it is, dear Friends, that men fear the Lord because
   He forgives their sins? It must be so because, first, if He did not
   forgive their sins, there would be nobody left to fear Him, for they
   would all die! If He were to deal with men after their sins, He must
   sweep the whole race of mankind off the face of the earth! But there is
   forgiveness with Him, that He may be feared.

   Next, if it were certain that God did not pardon sin, everybody would
   despair, and so, again, there would be nobody to fear Him, for a
   despairing heart grows hard like the nether millstone. Because they
   have no hope, men go on to sin worse and worse--but there is
   forgiveness with God that He may be feared. The devils never repent,
   for there is no pardon for them. There is no Gospel preached in Hell
   and, consequently, there is no relenting, no repenting, no turning
   towards God among lost spirits. But there is forgiveness with Him that
   He may be feared by you. What a wonderful effect pardon has upon a man!

   What a wonderful effect it has upon a man to know that he is pardoned,
   to be sure that he is forgiven! He begins to tremble all over. Remember
   how it is written, "And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the
   captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
   And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have
   sinned against Me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they
   have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against Me. And it
   shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the
   nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto
   them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all
   the prosperity that I procure unto it."

   A man who has been forgiven is afraid that he should go and sin again
   after such love and such mercy. He is melted down by the goodness of
   the Lord. He does not know what to make of it. For a time he can hardly
   believe that it is true! I know that when I was converted, I felt at
   first like Peter when the great iron gate was opened, and the angel
   brought him out of prison. He knew not what was done to him by the
   angel and he thought he saw a vision--he could not believe it to be
   true that he was really released! So is it with the saved sinner--you
   are so amazed, you are so overwhelmed, that you are filled with fear at
   the intense delight of pardon, being half afraid that it cannot really
   be true that such a wretch as you can have been pardoned and that all
   your iniquities are blotted out forever! The wondrous Grace of God
   makes you tremble with a holy reverential fear and you sing, with Dr.
   Watts--

   "When God revealed His gracious name

   And changed my mournful state,

   My rapture seemed a pleasing dream,

   The Grace appeared so great!"

   Are there any of God's people here who are afraid that they do not fear
   God enough? If you want to revive your fear of God and have it
   deepened, believe in your pardon. Believe! It is a singular way to come
   to fear God, but believe that you are forgiven, prize your forgiveness,
   know that your sins are blotted out, cling to the Cross and all that
   sweet fear of God, by which is meant the whole of piety, will abound in
   your soul!

   Some think that it will be a good way of deepening their Graces to
   begin to question whether they are Christians. That is the wrong way
   altogether! Unbelief does not heal anybody--it is faith that heals!
   Believe up to the hilt! Believe, come what may! Believe in Christ,
   though your sins rage and rave and roar! Believe in Christ, though the
   devil tells you, you are damned! Should Hell seem to open at your feet,
   believe in your pardon through the precious blood! Do not stagger at
   the promises of God through unbelief, and you shall feel yourself
   filled with a holy fear, joy, peace, love, zeal and a burning desire to
   serve Him who has done all this for you! "There is forgiveness with
   You, that You may be feared."

   If any of you poor people, here, who have not yet found the Savior, are
   saying, "We wish that we could feel our sin more. We wish that we could
   fear the Lord more." Let me tell you that this fear is to come to you
   afterwards. There is forgiveness, first, and then the fear comes
   afterwards. All the fear in the world that is worth having is the
   result of pardoned sin. The fear that is not to be cast out, the fear
   that has no torment in it, is that fear which comes of a sense of every
   iniquity being blotted out! I charge you, believe in Jesus Christ! In
   the name of Jesus of Nazareth, I say to you unbelieving ones--Believe
   in Him now! Rise, take up your bed, and walk. I, who have no power
   whatever of myself, yet speaking in my Master's name, know that His
   power will go with His Gospel and that His Word shall not return to Him
   void. Believe and live! God bless you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALMS 129; 130; 131.

   Three Songs of degrees.

   Psalm 129:1, 2. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may
   Israel now say: many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet
   they have not prevailed against me. The trials of some of God's people
   begin very early. When first we put on the armor of God, the adversary
   is usually very bitter against us. Some of our old friends and
   acquaintances cannot bear to see the change in us--and they bitterly
   oppose us--so that God's children may have to say, "From our youth they
   have afflicted us." But you must not think that the beginning of
   sorrows will be the end of them. Oh, no! "Many a time have they
   afflicted me." God's children are often called to pass under the rod
   and the rod is frequently held in the hands of the children of men.
   Your Savior carried the Cross and He expects you to carry it, too. He
   does not tell you to take it up now and then, but to take it up always,
   and to follow Him with a constant will, cheerfully bearing it for His
   dear name's sake. "Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth:
   yet"--is not that sweetly put?--"yet they have not prevailed against
   me." You remember how Joseph's brothers envied him and, at last, sold
   him into Egypt? Yet from the dungeon he rose to the throne and he could
   say, "Yet they have not prevailed against me." If you are of the seed
   royal, one of the chosen people of God, they shall not prevail against
   you! Even proud Haman, with all his plotting, was not able to overcome
   poor Mordecai! And the Lord your God will preserve you from the fury of
   all your adversaries and bring good to you out of all the evil they try
   to do to you.

   3. Theplowersplowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. Like
   one that has been cruelly scourged until each cut of the lash seemed to
   make a furrow through the quivering flesh. "The plowers plowed upon my
   back: they made long their furrows." How truly could our blessed Lord
   utter these words when He was delivered up to wicked men to be
   scourged!

   4. The LORD is righteous: He has cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
   "The Lord is righteous." There is our hope and comfort! He takes away
   from them the scourge and cuts up the cords of which it is made. And
   those cords with which they would bind the righteous He cuts into
   pieces, so that they can do nothing against them--"He has cut asunder
   the cords of the wicked."

   5. Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. So it
   seems that the one aimed at and made to suffer is the Church of
   God--"Zion." She has often been scourged and afflicted! Her experience
   is like that of her Covenant Head, and her triumph will be like His
   triumph.

   6-8. Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it
   grows up: wherewith the mower fills not his hand; nor he that binds
   sheaves to his bosom. Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of
   the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. So the
   adversaries of the Church of God may grow as fast as grass on the roof
   of a house, but they will perish just as fast, and there will be
   nothing left of them! They threaten, they bully, they rage, they rave--
   but it is only for a little while. Now we will read the "De Profundis"
   Psalm.

   Psalm 130:1. Out of the depths have I cried unto You, O LORD. God's
   people have to go into the depths and God's people pray in the
   depths--and often they pray best in the depths! The rarest pearls lie
   deepest in the sea and the most precious prayers come out of the depths
   of affliction--"Out of the depths have I cried unto You, O Lord."
   Cannot many of you say the same? Looking back upon your past
   afflictions and trials, yet you can feel that you did pray in them. He
   that can pray in the depths will soon sing in the heights! If you can
   pray, you cannot be drowned by all the seas that roll over you. God who
   brought you into them will bring you out of them if you can pray.

   2. Lord, Or, "Adonai," Sovereign Lord--

   2. Hear my voice: let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my
   supplications. "Hear me, Lord!" What is the use of prayer if God does
   not hear it? It is said to be a profitable spiritual exercise. So it
   is, because we believe that God hears it! But apart from that, it would
   be an idle waste of words. "Lord, hear my voice: let Your ears be
   attentive to the voice of my supplications."

   3. If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? Not
   one of us, surely! If God were to now deal with us according to our
   sins, who among us could stand in His Presence?

   4. 5. But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared. I wait
   for the LORD, my soul does wait, and in His Word do I hope. See, this
   is all in the first person. Dear Friend, can you use it in the first
   person? Can you say, "I wait for Jehovah"? Blessed are they that are
   content to wait His will, but yet, with holy eagerness, are prepared to
   do that will or to suffer it, as He pleases. "My soul does wait, and in
   His Word do I hope." All my hope is there. If it were not for His
   promises I would have no confidence, but one Word of God is better than
   all the things that can be seen! It is better to trust in God's
   declaration than in man's oaths. It is better to trust in the Lord than
   to put confidence in princes.

   6. My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the
   morning. I say, more than they that watch for the morning! Those on the
   sick bed, who long for their weary waiting to be over. Those afflicted
   ones who cry in the night of pain, "Would God it were morning!" Those,
   too, that stand as sentinels, the night before the battle, or after the
   fight, watch and long to see the morning light. There are many such
   weary waiters and my soul is one of them, waiting for the Lord, "more
   than they that watch for the morning."

   7. Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and
   with Him is plenteous redemption. Enough to buy us back from all our
   slavery and to buy back our inheritance as well. Our Redeemer is the
   redeemer of the inheritance that has been mortgaged and now is burdened
   by the enormous debt of sin--"with Him is plenteous redemption."

   8. And He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. That is our
   worst slavery, our in-equities, our lack of equity, our having acted
   unfairly to God and unfairly to man. He will redeem us from all that
   evil--yes, He has redeemed us by price--and He will redeem us by power!

   Psalm 131:1. LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty: neither
   do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. I
   commend this verse to some who profess to be Christians, but who are
   always puzzling their poor brains with intricate questions--who want to
   solve the mystery of where free will and predestination can meet, how
   man can be responsible and yet God's predestination can be
   fulfilled--and I know not what beside! These are great waters the waves
   whereof are too big for our little boats! We have quite enough to do,
   my Brothers, to attend to the plain things of God's Word, and to strive
   after holiness and the salvation of our fellow men, without addicting
   ourselves to tying knots and trying to untie them! It is an
   unprofitable business--it genders to pride rather than to anything
   else--and well did David say, "My heart is not haughty, nor my eyes
   lofty, neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too
   high for me."

   2. Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned
   of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. That is a very
   blessed thing to be able to do, to quiet yourself when, like a weaned
   child, you are crying under the afflicting hand of God--when you feel a
   proud spirit murmuring, or when you want to pierce the darkness that
   veils Divine Truth and want to understand what cannot be
   understood--and you worry because you are not Omniscient. Oh, it is a
   blessed thing, then, to say to yourself, "Be quiet, child! Be quiet!"
   What are you but a child, after all, at your best? What do you know?
   What can you know? Are you not satisfied to hear your Father say, "What
   you know not now, you shall know hereafter"? Do you not know that here
   we know but in part, and see but in part? By-and-by, we shall know even
   as we are known, but not yet. "I have behaved and quieted myself, as a
   child that is weaned of his mother"--as a child who sucks his thumb and
   goes to sleep, sobbing--"my soul is even as a weaned child." David did
   not say, "My soul is even as a weaning child"--fretting, worrying,
   wanting to have its own will. There is no happiness in that state! But
   when it is not the, "ing," but the, "ed"--not the present participle,
   but the past--then we get into comfort! "My soul is even as a weaned
   child," who has given up his old comfort, which he thought was as
   necessary to him as his life. He finds that, after all, he can live
   without it, and grow without it, and come to a better manhood without
   it than with it! "My soul is even as a weaned child."

   3. Let Israel hope in the LORD--You will never be weaned from Him if
   you are His, but if you are weaned from the world, so as to have all
   your hope in the Lord, thrice happy are you! Now, too, you will grow.
   Now you will come to the fullness of the stature of a man in Christ
   Jesus which you could never have done if you had not been weaned! I
   remember that when Sarah weaned Isaac, there was a great feast at the
   weaning, and I believe that God's children often have a great feast at
   their weaning from the world. All the while they are but babes and suck
   their comforts from the world, they get but little real joy. But when,
   by Divine Grace, they outgrow that state of things, then is there a
   great feast made for them!

   3. From henceforth and forever. That is real comfort that you may
   always enjoy, hoping in the Lord from henceforth and forever! In life
   and in death here is a blessed confidence that will never fail you! God
   grant that we may enjoy it now and evermore! Amen.

The Model Soul-winner

   (No. 2423)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 28, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   10, 1887.

   "There came a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give
   Me a drink." John 4:7.

   THIS was the beginning of that interesting conversation which not only
   blessed this woman, but has been a means of Grace to many others ever
   since, for this chapter and the previous one must be looked upon as
   among the most soul-winning parts of God's Word. I suppose that every
   portion of Scripture has had its use in the experience of men and
   women, but these two chapters have very, very largely been blessed in
   the commencement of the Divine Life. Many have been led through the
   door of regeneration and the gateway of faith by the Truth of God so
   plainly taught in them.

   I shall not delay you with any preface, but shall take you at once to
   the subject mentioned in our text.

   I. You have before you, here, first, THE MODEL SOUL-WINNER. Jesus said
   to the woman of Samaria, "Give Me a drink." I speak to many here who
   are wise to win souls. I hope that I also address many more who,
   although they have not yet learned this wisdom, are anxious, if
   possible, to be used of God to bless their fellow creatures. Here,
   then, is a perfect model for you--study it and copy it.

   First, observe that our Savior, as the model Soul-Winner, was not
   reserved and distant. "Jesus therefore, being wearied with His journey,
   sat thus on the well." If He had not been wonderfully anxious to win a
   soul, He would have kept Himself to Himself--and if this woman had
   spoken to Him, He would have answered her shortly and have let her see
   that He did not desire any conversation with her. There is a way of
   being civil, but, at the same time, of repressing anything like
   familiarity. There are some persons who have great gifts of
   freezing--they can freeze you, almost, with a look! You never dare to
   speak to them, again. In fact, you stand and wonder how you could ever
   have had the impertinence to address such exalted personages! They
   evidently live in a very distinct world from that in which your poor
   self resides-- they could not sympathize with you--they are too good or
   too great, too clever. And if you do not complain of their conduct, yet
   you give them a wide berth and keep clear of them in the future, for
   they are not at all the sort of people that attract you. They repel you
   by their coldness. They are not magnets, or, if so, they exercise the
   very opposite influence from that of attraction.

   Now, if any of you are in such a frame of mind as that, pray the Lord
   to bring you out of it! But do not attempt to do any good while you are
   in such a condition, for you might as well try to heat an oven with
   snowballs as to win souls for Christ with a distant cold, dignified
   manner of speech! No, cast all that away, for nothing can render you so
   feeble, and so useless, as to cultivate anything like separateness from
   your fellows. Come close to the sinner, draw near to him or to
   her--show that you are not keeping yourself to yourself, but that you
   regard the person you are addressing as a brother or sister--as one who
   will find, in you, a sympathizer who is touched with the feeling of his
   infirmities, seeing that you have suffered in many points like he has
   suffered and are, therefore, on the same level, and desire to stand on
   the same platform with him--and to do him good.

   There was nothing stiff and starched about the Savior. He was the very
   reverse of that and even children felt that they might go to Him
   freely. He was like a great harbor into which sailors run their ships
   in stress of weather--they feel as if it was made on purpose for them.
   The very look of Christ's face, the very glistening of His eyes,
   everything about Him made people feel that He did not live for Himself
   at all, but that He desired to bless others! There is the model
   Soul-Winner, therefore, for your imitation, in Jesus sitting on the
   well and condescending even to speak to a poor fallen woman!

   In the next place, our Savior was aggressive and prompt. He did not
   wait for the woman to speak to Him, but He addressed her. "Give Me a
   drink," He said. He did not wait until she had drawn the water from the
   well and was about to go--and so give her an excuse for saying, "I
   cannot be detained. I must get home with the water and the sun is hot,"
   but no sooner has He seen her and her waterpot, than He begins a
   conversation with His request to her, "Give Me a drink." The true
   soul-winner is like a man who goes out shooting--he is not half asleep
   so that when the game presents itself, he waits till it has taken wing
   and has gone. He is on the alert--if a feather or a leaf moves, he has
   his gun all ready, and he is prepared for action at once! The cunning
   fowler spreads his nets early in the morning before the birds are
   awake, that when they first begin to move, they may be taken in his
   traps. And the Lord Jesus, with a loving wisdom, went about His work.
   He began with the woman at once--as soon as she came to the well where
   He was resting, He spoke to her and soon led the talk to the things
   which concerned the Christ and her own sin--and the way by which the
   Christ might lift her out of her sin and make her useful for the
   conversion of others.

   I am afraid that there are some of you who cannot do that--you are so
   reserved, you say. How often have I told you that the soldier who was
   so "retiring" was shot? There was a battle going on and the man was so
   modest and retiring that he went to the rear of the fight--and they
   called him a coward and shot him dead! I am not going to call you a
   coward, nor to shoot you! Still, I wish you would not get into the rear
   so much. While souls are perishing, it does not do to be reserved and
   retiring! A man who can swim and would let his fellow man sink would
   hardly be excused if he said, "I was so retiring that I could not push
   myself upon him. I never had the good man's card and I did not want to
   force myself upon him without an introduction, so I let him drown. I
   was very sorry, but still, I never was a pushing person."

   Are you going to let men be damned? Are you going to let the masses of
   people in this city perish in their sins? If so, God have mercy upon
   you! The question will not be, "What will become of London in this
   case?" But the question will be, "What will become of you who let men
   die in their sins without trying to rescue them?" Carry the war into
   the enemy's country! Speak to people whom you do not know, whom you
   have never seen before, as Jesus did! Speak to that woman whom you meet
   casually and Providentially, as He did! Speak to her when the last
   thing she wants is that you should speak to her. Speak out at once and
   let yours be an aggressive Christianity that is prompt to seize every
   opportunity of doing good! What a model Soul-Winner, then, you have
   here!

   Next, the Savior was bold, but He was also wise. You cannot
   sufficiently admire the wisdom of our blessed Lord that He spoke to
   this woman while she was alone. He could not have said to her what He
   said and she would never have said to Him what she said, if anybody
   else had been there. It was necessary that this interview be held in
   private. But, oh, you who are so zealous that you are imprudent, you
   who would gladly win souls but attempt the task without that care which
   ought to come naturally to every sensible and prudent man, remember
   that although Christ spoke alone with this woman, it was in broad
   daylight, at twelve o'clock, by the well. If some people had been as
   prudent as the Savior was, they could have afforded to be as zealous as
   they have been! In the case of such a woman as this, I would have you
   remember the Savior's wisdom as well as His wondrous condescension!

   With Nicodemus, the ruler of the Jews, He speaks by night, but with the
   harlot of Samaria He speaks by day. The soul-winner looks about him, he
   is wise in his plan of going to work. There are fish that will only
   bite in troubled waters. There are some that are not to be taken except
   at night and there are others that are only to be caught by daylight.
   Fit yourself to the case of the person you are seeking to bless! I do
   not say be so prudent that you will run no risk, but I will say, be so
   prudent, especially in certain difficult cases, that you run no
   unnecessary risk! The Savior could not have selected a better time for
   talking to such a person--you will see at once that if even the
   disciples marveled that He spoke with the woman--it was infinitely wise
   on His part that it was done at the well side and done at noon.

   O Soul-Winners, win souls any way you can! Be willing to risk your own
   reputation, if necessary, to win them, but it is not necessary, or not
   usually necessary, and it never should be done except when it is
   necessary. Your Savior sets you that wise example. Follow Him in this
   speaking to people singly. I do so much of public preaching that,
   perhaps, I lose a measure of adaptation for private conversation, yet
   have I sometimes done the most successful work I have ever done in
   private rather than in public! Sitting at a table, I have marked a
   young man who was a stranger to me, and I have asked him to accompany
   me to the place where I was to preach. I did not know the way and I
   asked him to walk with me. A few words on the road won him for Christ
   and he has been, ever since, an earnest upholder of the Gospel and a
   very useful one! I do not know whether any were saved by the sermon,
   but I know that one was converted by the talk on the way there!

   I know an Evangelist who is useful in his public service, but he is
   also greatly useful to the families in the homes where he stays. Almost
   in every case the minister's sons and daughters are converted before he
   leaves the house, or the servant or a visitor is won by his private
   conversation. I like that kind of work! Oh, that we all studied this
   art of speaking to persons one by one! So I say to you, again, here is
   the model Soul-Winner--copy His example.

   Observe how the Savior begins with this woman--"Jesus said to her, Give
   Me a drink." When you are fishing, it is not always wise to throw your
   fly straight at the fish's mouth. Try him a little on one side, and
   then a little on the other side, and maybe, presently, you will get a
   bite. So the Savior does not begin by saying to her, "You are a sinful
   woman." Oh, dear, none but an amateur in such a business would begin
   like that! Neither did He begin by saying, "Now, good mistress, I am
   the Messiah." Well, that was the truth, was it not? Yes, but that was
   not to come first--He began by saying, "Give Me a drink." He must first
   attract her attention and influence her mind--then would come the
   closer work of probing her conscience and changing her heart!

   It was only a very ordinary, commonplace request that Jesus made. "Give
   Me a drink." It might have occurred to any one of you to say it, but
   not to use it as He did. Yet it was a word that was wisely chosen, for
   it fitted in with the woman's thoughts. She was thinking about drawing
   water and Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink." There could be no more
   suitable metaphor or mode of expression than that of water and drinking
   if you are talking to a person who has come to draw water for herself
   or others to drink.

   Besides that, it was an exceedingly pregnant expression, as full of
   meaning as an egg is full of meat. "Give Me a drink." It contained much
   within itself. It gave the Savior as wide a field as He could wish for
   to talk to her about her spiritual thirst, and about that Living Water
   which He could put within her, which would abide in her, and be a
   well-- not one to which she should come--but a well that she would
   carry about with her and that would be always springing up within her
   unto everlasting life! So let us learn how to begin wisely with
   observations that are apparently commonplace, but such as will easily
   lead to higher things.

   I think that the Savior, as the model Soul-Winner, is also to be
   imitated in that at the very beginning He broke down a barrier. The
   Lord Jesus Christ was evidently dressed as a Jew and this woman came
   out of Samaria. Now, at once, there was a barrier between the two, for
   the Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans. Our Lord broke through
   that caste by saying to her, "Give Me a drink." No other expression
   would do this so well, for to eat and to drink with persons was, after
   the Oriental fashion, to come into communion with them. "Give Me a
   drink," therefore, shook off from Him all Judaism which would separate
   Him from this Samaritan. If you are going to try to win people for
   Christ, always seek to break down everything that would separate. Are
   you a man of wealth? Well, I do not believe in converting souls by
   making your diamond rings glitter and flash when you are talking to
   workingmen.

   Are you a scientific man? Now, that word of 17 syllables that you have
   been so fond of--do not use it, but say something very plain and
   simple! Or do you happen to belong to any political party? Do not bring
   that question in--you will not win souls that way--you will be more
   likely to excite prejudice and opposition. If I were talking to the
   French, I would devoutly wish I were a Frenchman. If I had to win a
   German, I should wish to know as much of the idiosyncrasies of that
   nation as I possibly could. I shall never be ashamed of being an
   Englishman, but if I could win more souls by being a Dutchman, or a
   Zulu, I would gladly have any kind of nationality, that I might get at
   the hearts of men! And our Lord Jesus acted just in that spirit when He
   said to the woman, "Give Me a drink." He sank the noble dignity of
   being a Jew-- for, mark you, a Jew is the aristocrat of God--Jesus,
   even in His humanity, came of a race that is made up of the oldest and
   noblest of earthly nobility, but He dropped that dignity in order that
   He might talk to this Samaritan woman who was nothing better than a
   mongrel, for her race was made up of nobody knows what! They pretended
   to be Jewish when there was anything to get by so doing--and to be
   Gentile whenever the Jews were in any kind of difficulties. But Jesus
   did not snub her, nor did He hint that she was in the least degree
   inferior to Himself. There is no winning souls in any other way than as
   the Savior won them. God teach us how to win them!

   This must suffice for that first point, the model Soul-Winner.

   II. Now for just a few minutes I want to exhibit our Divine Lord and
   Master in another light. Not this time as the model Soul-Winner, but as
   THE MASTER OF CONDESCENSION. He seems to me to be so thoughtful--this
   blessed

   Lord of ours, the Son of God, the Creator, the First-Begotten of God.

   He takes His seat there on the well in weariness and thirst. Do you not
   see Him almost ready to faint? What condescension this was, that He was
   so straitened that He had not even a drink of water, or the means to
   get it. Maker of all springs! Bearer of the key of the rain! Lord of
   the ocean and yet He needs water to drink? What a stoop is this, for
   your Lord and mine to come to this! When He said, "Foxes have holes,
   and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not where to
   lay His head," He had come very low, but now, even the water, which is
   such a common thing around us that it ripples from the hills and
   streams through the vales--even that has fled from Him--and He says,
   "Give Me a drink." Bless your Lord, O you who love Him! Kiss His feet
   and wonder at His marvelous condescension!

   I wonder at His condescension, next, that He not only came into such
   straitness, but that He was so humble as to ask for a drink of water.
   He that hears prayer, Himself prays! He that listens to the cries of
   His redeemed and, with the fullness of His majestic bounty, opens His
   hands and supplies the needs of every living thing, sits there and says
   to the woman, "Give Me a drink." O Master, how You have straitened
   Yourself! How You have humbled Yourself, that You should be a beggar of
   one of Your own creatures, asking for a sip of water!

   Admire that condescension still more when you think that HE asked it of
   her, of her who had had five husbands and he with whom she was living
   was not her husband! Yet Jesus says to her, "Give Me a drink." Some of
   you good women would not have touched her with a pair of tongs, would
   you? And some of you good men would have passed by her on the other
   side. Jesus, however, was not only willing to give to her, but He was
   willing to receive from her! He would put Himself under obligation to a
   Samaritan sinner! So He says to her, who was not fit to come near Him
   to unloose the laces of His shoes--John the Baptist said that He was
   not worthy to do that--but what was she worthy to do? Yet Jesus says
   even to her, "Give Me a drink."

   Then notice His condescension, again, when she answers Him tartly with
   a reply that was perhaps civil in tone, but that was virtually a
   refusal, He did not upbraid her. He did not say to her, "Oh, you cruel
   woman!" No, not a syllable or look of reproof did He give her. He
   needed not the water that was in the well--He meant to have her
   heart--and He did have it and, therefore, He went on to speak to her.
   Is not that a beautiful text, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
   of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraids not"? So the
   Savior will not give this woman a word of upbraiding-- she shall be led
   to upbraid herself--but it shall be for her sin! She shall not be
   upbraided for her ungenerous reply that the Savior has passed over.

   This is the crown of Christ's condescension, that He led her not to do
   what He asked her to do, but He led her to confess her sin. He said,
   "Give Me a drink," but apparently she did not let down that waterpot,
   neither did He put it to His lips, parched as they were. But He led her
   to her confession of sin, her faith in Him, her running to call the
   men--and all this gave Him meat to eat and water to drink that others
   knew not of! He had won a soul and this had refreshed Him after His
   weariness. We do not hear of His being weary any more--He shook it all
   off at sight of that sinner saved! He was Himself, again, for He had
   received what He would die to win. He had received a heart returning to
   the great Father, He had found a soul that trusted in Him!

   I wish that I knew how to preach better so that I might lead you to my
   Master, for I do want you to glorify Him. I have often tried to set Him
   before you as He hung upon the Cross, and as He will come again in His
   glorious Second Advent. But just now I ask you to adore Him in His
   weariness as He sits upon the well! He is never lovelier than in His
   lowliness. There is a grandeur about Him when He rides to battle on His
   white horse and summons the kites and eagles to devour the slain, but
   we start back from that terrible vision of majesty to the
   attractiveness of His Love when He thus humbles Himself and makes
   Himself of no reputation and talks with a fallen woman! Seeing Him thus
   condescending, we love, reverence, admire and adore Him! Let us do so
   now.

   III. I shall have done when I have taken up my third point with
   considerable brevity, but with no little earnestness. It is this. You
   have seen the model Soul-Winner and the Master of condescension. Let us
   now notice THE MANNER OF THE WORKING OF GRACE with the view that we may
   see it here this evening.

   So you have come here, my Friend. You have not come to be saved. Oh,
   no! That is very far from your mind. You came to see the place, you
   came to look at a building to which a crowd will come and listen to a
   minister of the Gospel.

   Yes, yes, but even that is no reason why you should not get a blessing,
   for this woman only came to draw water. "There came a woman of Samaria
   to draw water." She had no desire to see Jesus, or to learn of Him. She
   was only looking for water! Saul went to seek his father's asses and
   found a kingdom! So you may find what you never sought and you may be
   found of Him whom you never sought!

   Listen! Open your ears! Perhaps your Day of Grace has come and the
   great silver bell is striking the hour of your sal-vation--I hope that
   it is so. It may be so, though you have no thought of it. You are not
   converted, you are not a Christian, but you would like to do good in
   the world, would you not? You desire to do some kindly action,
   something generous. I have known that thought arise in a great many who
   yet did not know the Lord. Some people will not ask an unconverted
   person to give money. I would, for my Master said to a woman who was a
   great sinner, "Give Me a drink." It may be to the everlasting good of
   some of you to do something for the Church of God, to do something for
   the Christ of God! Before you know where you are, it may be that you
   will commit yourselves by some kindly act. I wish you would do so.

   The way to win a person to yourself is not always to do him good, but
   to let him do you good. Jesus knew that, so He began by saying, "Give
   Me a drink." So sometimes it may be wise--and I would try it now--to
   say to some of you, "You would like to do someone good, would you not?
   You would like to do some kindly action." Well, notice, the Master is
   here, tonight, and He has come with much the same cry as He came to the
   Samaritan woman. Jesus says to you, "Give Me a drink." "Oh," you say,
   "What could I give Christ to drink? If He were here, I would gladly
   give Him a drink. I am sure that if I were at my cottage door and He
   passed by on a dusty day, I would gladly turn the handle of the well
   and bring up a bucket of water. Though I am not converted, I would do
   that." Well, dear Heart, you may do that! I want you to do it! It is
   your privilege to refresh the very heart of Christ! If you were not a
   sinner, you could not do it, but being a guilty sinner, you can do it!
   Your very guilt and sin give you the possibility of refreshing Him.
   "How?" you ask. Why, repent of your sin! Have done with it, quit it,
   turn from it. "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over
   one sinner that repents." It does not say that the angels rejoice,
   though I have no doubt that they do, but it is said, "There is joy in
   the presence of the angels." That is, the angels see the joy of Christ
   when a sinner repents! They spy it out and notice it. If you let fall a
   tear of repentance. If in your heart there is a sense of shame because
   of your sin. If in your soul there is the resolve to escape from it,
   you have refreshed Him!

   Next, guilty as you are, you can refresh Him by seeking salvation from
   Him. Did He not say to the woman, "If you knew the gift of God, and who
   it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked of Him,
   and He would have given you living water"? And when she said to Jesus,
   "Sir, give me this water," that refreshed Him! Ask this of Him, now,
   quietly in your soul. Oh, may God the Holy Spirit persuade you to do
   so! Cry to Him to save you! Say, "Lord Jesus, save me! I am but a girl
   and careless, but save me." "I am a young man and thoughtless, but save
   me tonight." By so doing, you have given Him a drink, and He is already
   refreshed! The sweetest drink of all is when you perceive that He is
   the Christ, and that God has sent Him to save you--and you give
   yourself up to be saved by Him!

   Trust Him now--may the good Spirit lead you to trust Him now! So will
   you refresh Him--this is the recompense for all His wounds and even for
   His death--when sinful souls come and trust Him. I remember hearing of
   one who, while walking the fields, found a little bird fly into his
   bosom. He could not understand why the creature should come there, but
   when he looked up, there was a hawk which had pursued the bird, and the
   little thing had flown into the bosom of the man for shelter. What do
   you think? Did the man tear it in pieces? No. He kept it safely till he
   had taken it away from the place where the hawk was--and then he gave
   it its liberty again. The Lord Jesus Christ will do just that with you
   if you trust Him! Sin pursues you--fly to His bosom, for only there are
   you safe!

   I have heard of a great king who had pitched his royal pavilion and
   when he was about to move it, he found that a bird had come and built
   its nest there. He was such a king that, although the pavilion was of
   silk, he ordered his soldiers not to take it down until that bird's
   young ones were hatched and could fly. I love the generosity of a
   prince who will act like that, but my Lord is a nobler and kinder
   Prince than all others! Oh, what a Prince He is for generosity! Poor
   bird, if you will dare to trust Him and make your nest in the pavilion
   where He dwells, you shall never be destroyed, nor your hope, either,
   but you shall be safe forever!

   Oh, that I knew how to bring you to Christ, dear Hearers! This is a hot
   summer's night and you are weary, perhaps, of my talking, but I would
   not mind that if I could bring you to Jesus! Oh, that I might have
   fruit from this sermon! This week I believe I might say that I have met
   and heard of hundreds who, in past years, have been brought to the
   Savior by the printed sermons. They came to me, grasped my hand, and
   thanked me--and I praised God--but then I thought, "Yes, God did bless
   me, and He has blessed the printed sermons, but I want present fruit,
   and to see sinners, now, close in with Christ and be eternally saved."
   Is all that I preach to you only a dream or a fiction? Then, fling it
   away from you and despise both it and me! But if it is true and if I
   only tell you of a true salvation, and a true Savior, come and have it,
   come and trust Him now, for He casts out none who come to Him! May this
   be the deciding time with many of you, for our Lord Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN4:1-32.

   Verses 1-4. When, therefore, the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard
   that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, (though Jesus
   Himself baptized not, but His disciples), He left Judea and departed
   again into Galilee. And He needed to go through Samaria. When He was
   needed in so many places, He did not care to stay among the Pharisees
   where He was not wanted. They would not receive His message, so He left
   the lordly professors and went to look after a fallen woman! Christ's
   estimates of usefulness are not always the same as ours. We think it a
   grand thing to be the means of converting a great man--Christ thinks it
   a worthy work to convert a great sinner!

   5. Then He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near to
   the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. You remember
   how the Patriarch said to his favorite son, "Moreover I have given to
   you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of
   the Amorite with my sword and with my bow." This was "the parcel of
   ground" which was near to Sychar.

   6. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied with His
   journey, sat thus on the well. What could the wearied Savior do? Why,
   He could save a great sinner! And now that He is no more wearied, what
   can He not do? Brethren, when you go to preach or to teach, you like to
   feel fresh and vigorous, but do not think that this state is at all
   necessary! Your wearied Master won the woman at Samaria. So may you win
   souls, even in your weariness! Let us not make excuses for ourselves
   because we do not feel fit for our work. God may bless us more when we
   feel weary than He does at any other time.

   6. And it was about the sixth hour. Twelve o'clock in the day, I
   suppose. Was that the time when the women usually came to draw water?
   No, but it was the time when a woman who was shunned by other women
   would be most likely to come--and the Savior knew that. She had to take
   odd times to get to the well, for her neighbors did not care to be seen
   in the company of such a reprobate as she was--and she was probably
   just as anxious to avoid them.

   7, 8. Then came a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her,
   Give Me a drink. (For His disciples were gone away unto the city to buy
   meat). Or, "food."

   9. Then said the woman of Samaria unto Him, How is it that You, being a
   Jew, ask me for a drink, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have
   no dealings with the Samaritans. The woman seemed to say to the Savior,
   "You Jews will not acknowledge us until You want something from us! Now
   that You happen to be thirsty, You do not mind asking for a drink from
   me, but, at other times, You will have no dealings with us." This was a
   tart reply to our Lord's request, but He did not answer the woman in
   the tone she had adopted. When you are dealing with a soul, you must
   not lose your temper because of a sharp word, a hard saying, or even a
   blasphemous reply. Soul-winners must be very tender and gentle. God
   make us so!

   10. Jesus answered and said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and
   who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink; you would have asked of
   Him, and He would have given you living water. Oh, that ignorance, that
   baneful ignorance! "If you knew, you would have asked of Him, and He
   would have given you." Sometimes, my Brothers and Sisters, the key of a
   man's salvation may lie in your instructing him in the simplest matters
   of the Gospel, for, if he does but know, he will ask--and Christ will
   give! Great issues may depend upon this, which seems but the turning of
   a straw. Therefore, go and tell men the way of salvation, for, in the
   most of cases, ignorance, alas, bars the door! I mean not among those
   who have long heard the Gospel, but I mean the outsiders who do not
   know anything about it. Tell it to them and you may, thereby, open to
   them the Kingdom of Heaven.

   11-14. The woman said to Him, Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and
   the well is deep: from where, then, have You that living water? Are You
   greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank
   thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? Jesus answered and
   said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again: but
   whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst;
   but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
   springing up into everlasting life. So you see, my dear Hearer, if you
   get Grace from Christ, you really possess it and it is of that nature
   that it remains in you and becomes, itself, a spring within you,
   "springing up into everlasting life." It is not that temporary,
   trumpery salvation which some preach, which saves you for a quarter of
   a year and then lets you perish! It is everlasting salvation! Once
   received, it does not pass away like that little dribbling shower that
   watered the pavement just now, and is gone, but it shall be in you a
   well of water, springing up, a living and enduring principle, or, to
   use another Scriptural expression, "incorruptible seed, which lives and
   abides forever." This salvation is worth your having! Then, get it! It
   is worth your pining after, praying for and believing. Oh, that you
   might have it, even you! As soon as you trust the Lord Jesus Christ, it
   is yours, and yours forever!

   15. The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not,
   neither come here to draw. The woman had not even the faintest idea of
   the spiritual truth of which Christ had spoken to her. The fact is,
   conviction must come before conversion. No sinner is made alive till he
   is first killed. You cannot clothe him till he is naked. So now the
   Savior began that conviction work in this woman--and He did it very
   wisely. He did not, at first, charge her with criminality, but He led
   her to accuse herself.

   16, 17. Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here. The
   woman answered and said, I have no husband. And, as she said it, no
   doubt she tried to look as innocent as possible. But a guilty flush
   stole over her face despite her attempt to keep it back.

   17. Jesus said to her, you have well said, I have no husband. Always
   give people credit for what is well said. If you want to win them, you
   must mind that you are not rough with them, but admit what you can of
   the truth in their utter-ance--"you have well said, I have no husband."

   18, 19. For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not
   your husband: in that said you truly. The woman said unto Him, Sir, I
   Perceive that You are a Prophet. It would have been better if she had
   perceived that she was a sinner! Perhaps she did perceive it, but
   scarcely cared, yet, to confess it openly, so she said, "I perceive
   that You are a Prophet." Now she has a religious difficulty and what
   man or woman is there in the world, however far gone from morality, who
   has not some religious difficulties? And the more immoral they become,
   the more difficulties they are pretty sure to have. I hate that style
   of preaching which is everlastingly pandering to difficulties which
   never would exist except in a dissolute generation like the present! We
   preach a plain Gospel and when men's hearts are right, it is all plain
   to them. To him who desires to understand, difficulties soon cease to
   be a trouble! We had better deal with men's hearts and lives than try
   to answer their quibbling questions. This was the woman's dilemma--

   20. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain. That is, Mount Gerizim--

   20-23. And You say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to
   worship. Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour comes when you
   shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
   Father. You worship you know not what--we know what we worship: for
   salvation is of the Jews. But the hour comes, and now is, when the true
   worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the
   Father seeks such to worship Him. You see, Brothers and Sisters, all
   the difficulties that arise are but temporary! Put them away and get to
   the great spiritual business that concerns us all-- the truly seeking
   after God in spirit and in truth! If you really want to find God, you
   shall find Him. He is already seeking you and your very desire after
   Him is the proof that He has already had dealings with you by His
   Spirit! Therefore, come unto Him and come at once, "for the Father
   seeks such to worship Him."

   24-27. God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in
   spirit and in truth. The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah comes,
   which is called Christ: when He is come, He will tell us all things.
   Jesus said to her, I that speak unto you am He. And upon this came His
   disciples. This gracious work of the Master had been done in private.
   Christ knew that such a person as this woman was not to be spoken to in
   the presence of His disciples, who were scarcely sympathetic enough for
   such service. But her heart is now won by the Messiah! So now you may
   come in, you disciples! Providence shut the door and kept them waiting
   a while until this delicate piece of work was done!

   27. And marveled that He talked with the woman. These men who had,
   themselves, been picked off the dunghill, marveled that Christ spoke to
   this woman! So have I known some who were, themselves, once grievous
   sinners, yet they have become horribly conceited some years after
   conversion. And they have thought that other great sinners might not be
   saved as they were! God deliver from such abominable pride any soul
   that professes to be saved! Every Believer should feel, "If the Lord
   has saved me, He can save anybody." And that state of mind ought always
   to be ours.

   27. Yet no man said, What seek You? or, Why talk You with her? They had
   some sense left, sense enough to keep silent.

   28. The woman then left her waterpot--Possessed only with one thought,
   going to tell others the glad news she. herself. had believed! She
   "left her waterpot."

   28, 29. And went her way into the city, and said to the men, Come, see
   a Man which told me all things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ?
   They must have been surprised to hear her talking about good things.
   There was no more likely messenger to win men, or to strike them with
   curiosity, than such a woman as this.

   30-32. Then they went out of the city and came to Him. In the meantime
   His disciples urged Him, saying, Master, eat. But He said unto them, I
   have meat to eat that you know not of. So has every man who lives to
   win souls for Christ! There is a table which he enters where the very
   delicacies of God are brought before him and his soul is sustained and
   his strength is renewed by the dainties that the Lord has provided for
   those who do His will! Brothers and Sisters, may we often feed upon
   this heavenly meat! Amen.

The New Song On Earth

   (No. 2424)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 4, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   17, 1887.

   "He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many
   shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD." Psalm 40:3.

   THIS man who talks about his song and seems to be very much struck with
   the fact that he has become a singer, was formerly a man of prayer. I
   doubt not that he was still praying while he was praising, but he began
   to pray before he began to praise. It is not good to go in the choir,
   first--we must begin our spiritual experience at the "penitent form."
   He who sings without having wept may have to weep, by-and-by, where he
   can never sing!

   Listen to what this man's experience had been--"I waited patiently for
   the Lord and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry." That is where God
   gets His singers--out of the place of praying and weeping! Where they
   learn to pray they begin to sing. Oh, yes, even in Heaven, itself, the
   sweetest voices that praise God and the Lamb belong to those who came
   out of great tribulation and washed their robes and made them white in
   the blood of the Lamb! Therefore are they before the Throne of God and
   serve Him day and night in His Temple. Do not try to get the joy of
   Christ without first having sorrow for sin--

   "The path of sorrow, and that path alone, Leads to the land where
   sorrow is unknown." This man, who says that God has put a new song in
   his mouth, began with a new prayer in his heart--"I waited patiently
   for the Lord and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry."

   Further, this man, who sings so well that he cannot help talking about
   it, was once in a very deplorable state where there was no singing for
   him, but God brought him up out of it! Hear what he says, "He brought
   me up, also, out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay and set my
   feet upon a rock, and established my goings." Nowadays people do not
   seem to know much about that horrible pit. I wish they did. There are
   more gentle, quiet conversions--and I care little how men are converted
   so long as they are really converted--but, after all, the old-fashioned
   sort of conversions wear best. Men who know from what they are
   saved--men who have felt the iron rod of the Law and have been crushed
   and broken beneath the millstones of conviction--these are they who
   appreciate "Free Grace and dying love" to the fullest and speak of it,
   and sing of it! I do not find so much of this singing, now, and the
   reason is because there has been so little of the deep experience of
   which our good old fathers used to speak.

   The Psalmist says, "He brought me up, also, out of an horrible pit out
   of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my
   goings and, therefore, it is that this new song is in my mouth."--

   "Firm on rock He made me stand, And taught my cheerful tongue To praise
   the wonders of His hand In a new thankful song."

   I. First, notice that we have HERE A MAN AMAZED TO FIND HIMSELF SINGING
   for the text is evidently a declaration that God had put a new song
   into his mouth and that it was a marvel, even to himself. Here is,
   then, a man amazed to find himself singing, and it would not be
   difficult to find one like he, here.

   What makes you so amazed, my Friend? Other people sing--why is it at
   all amazing that you should? He answers, "It is amazing that I should
   sing because I have been so used to sighing. Had you seen me, Sir, when
   the arrows of God stuck fast in me, you would have heard many sighs,
   but never a song! If you had followed me home, you would have found my
   pillow wet with tears. But I was no nightingale, I could not sing in
   the dark. I woke in the morning almost sorry to think that I had to
   face the world, again, and that I had my burden still to bear! And I
   chanted no morning hymn and I went about the world still burdened till
   night came on again. Those around me talked of vesper hymns, but I had
   no such hymns. I had my evening moans and groans, for sin was heavy
   upon me, and an angry God seemed to make the darkness about me a
   darkness that might be felt! Had you seen me then, you would not think
   it strange that I should be amazed that I now sing!" Oh, yes, dear
   Hearers, if you have ever known the depths of sorrow for sin, you will
   be amazed to think that you can be as happy as you are because Christ
   has loosened the burden from your shoulder and made you free, saying,
   "Go, and sin no more. Your sins, which are many, are all forgiven you."

   Well, my Friend, I can see why you are astonished at your singing. Is
   there any other reason? "Yes," he answers, "if you had known me a
   little farther back, before I came under the hand of God and was
   awakened to a sense of sin, you would have known a fellow that could
   sing, but the wonder, now, is that I can sing 'a new song.' I am glad,
   Sir that you did not hear me sing in those days, for my songs would
   have done you no good. They were very light and trifling, sometimes
   lewd and sometimes profane. Oh, how I set my companions in a roar with
   my jests! And when I had a little drink in me, how I liked to thunder
   out some loose verses and bid the others take up the chorus! And 'jolly
   good fellows' were all of us said to be when those hymns of the devil
   were upon our tongues." Oh, you are that man, are you? Yet I heard you
   sing, just now, and I think you sang it from your heart--

   "My heart is resting, O my God, I will give thanks and sing! My heart
   is at the secret Source Of every precious thing! And a 'newsong'is in
   my mouth, To long-loved music set! Glory to You for all the Grace I
   have not tasted yet. I have a heritage of joy That yet I must not see.
   The hand that bled to make it mine Is keeping it for me!"

   Ah, now I am amazed, too, that such a man as you once were should be
   singing such a song as that! O Brothers and Sisters, there are some of
   us here who are amazed at ourselves when we think of what we used to
   be! Some of you forget the dunghills where you grew, but if you have
   any honesty in you, you cannot but feel the tear starting up between
   your eyelids at the recollection of how God has changed you. What a
   miracle of mercy you are! Surely it took almighty power to make a saint
   of such a sinner as you were! The utmost bound of infinite love must
   have been reached in the case of some who are in this House of Prayer
   praising redeeming love and wishing that they had a thousand tongues
   with which to shout the Savior's praise! Yes, Friend, I can see why it
   is that you are amazed that a new song is put into your mouth! The time
   past well suffices us to have sung the songs of Belial--now let us sing
   unto the Lord with all our strength, and tell all around what great
   things His Grace has done for us!

   Still, my Friend, you who are so much amazed at yourself, you tell me
   that you marvel to find yourself singing because you so lately were
   sighing and, farther back, were singing such a different tune. Is there
   any other wonder in it? "Well, yes, Sir, my greatest wonder is because
   I am singing a new song. It is a totally new song--it is new to me, for
   I knew nothing of it, once. I ridiculed what I did not understand! I
   cast scorn on what I had not the candor to wish to know. I said that
   religion was all cant and that religious people were all hypocrites. I
   did not know this for a fact, but I said it, all the same. I did not
   want to know anything about Christ Crucified and the Gospel of His
   Grace. I said that these were only terms that were used by fanatical
   people and had no meaning in them. And as to the songs of Zion, why,
   Sir, I sometimes spoofed them to give a little zest to my profane
   merriment. But, as to singing them, myself, I felt that could never be
   the case."

   Yes, Beloved, there are some who are now singing of Free Grace and
   dying love who, years ago, would not have believed it possible even if
   a Prophet of God had told them it would be so! They would have spat at
   any man who would have said, "And you, too, will take up the cross, and
   follow the Nazarene." Yet tonight they are singing a song altogether
   new to them! These low notes of penitence, the deep bass of confession
   are all new to them--and these highest notes, the jubilates that rise
   even to the skies--are all new to them. None of this score did they
   ever read in their days of sin! They never tuned their harps to such
   Psalms as this in the time of their unregeneracy. It is all new to you.
   Do I not remember when it was all new to me? Yet I heard it when I was
   a child. I was never away from the hearing of it, but when I came to
   know it, it was just as new to me, nursed on the lap of piety, as it
   was to you who lived in the midst of a wicked world, for I was blind in
   the light as you were blind in the dark! I was deaf in the midst of
   music and you were only deaf in the midst of discord. There was but a
   slight difference between us, after all, and truly are we amazed to
   think that we should be singing a new song!

   It is not only called a new song because it is new to us, but because
   it is so uncommon. Rich and rare things are often called new in the
   Bible. There is a New Covenant, there is a new Commandment. I will not
   quote the many things in Scripture that are called new because they are
   so rare. And, oh, the praises of God are, indeed, rich and rare! If an
   angel, fresh from Heaven, were asked his judgment of the various kinds
   of music played or sung below, I know what he would say. Your finest
   operas and your noblest lyrics concerning things of time and sense
   would be but doggerel in his ears and discord to his heart! But the
   hymns in which we praise our dying, yet risen Lord--the Psalms in which
   we exalt the God of Heaven and earth--these would be music, indeed, to
   him, and he would write these down as truly sweet! Yes, and so it is to
   us! Dull is the song that does not praise our Lord! But the burst of
   united Psalmody from a vast congregation that exalts Him brings tears
   to our eyes, as Augustine says it did to his--when he heard the singing
   at Milan. When first he entered the church, there, to hear the many
   simple folk praise God, touched his soul. But if it is not so--if the
   music is not to the praise of the Lord--there is no thing rich and rare
   in it for us. Oh, believe us, we have learned a rare song now that we
   have learned to praise the Lord our God!

   And, truth to tell, there is a wonder about our new song because it is
   always new. Do you ever tire--you who love your Lord--do you ever tire
   of Him? You who praise Him, do you ever weary of singing His praises?
   You may very well weary of me, poor creature that I am--I who have
   addressed you so many hundreds of times--but you never weary of my
   subject when I talk of Jesus! You may very well weary of the monotony
   of any human voice, but you can never be tired of the many-stringed
   harp which is to be found in that one name, the name of Jesus! His
   name, fresh? Oh, I think it is newer to me, now, than when I first
   heard it! It may seem a paradox, but the Gospel is, to me, fresher, the
   longer I know it! Did not my heart leap at the sound of Christ's name
   nearly 40 years ago? Yes, but not as it does now! The music of His name
   will refresh our soul in death with a new depth of sweetness! It is all
   new as you go on in Jesus!

   You seem, sometimes, to fancy that you are coming to an end, but there
   is no end to this music! Did you ever sail up or down the Rhine? If so,
   standing in the steamboat you thought you were in a lake rather than in
   a river--and you wondered how you could proceed any farther. You turned
   a corner and the river opened up before you with a fresh stretch of
   beauty and where it seemed to end, again, the end was all a delusion,
   for it still went on and on! So is it with the song which the Lord has
   taught us--it is always fresh and always new! We may make it say, as
   the poet made his brook to sing--

   "Men may come, and men may go, But I go on forever"

   and so does the sweet melody of Jesus' precious name! It is a new song,
   a new song altogether!

   Yet, again, if you wonder that we call it new, let me remind you that
   it is new because it seems to have awakened us into a newness of life.
   I have seen men excited--look at them whenever there is an
   election--but there is a far better kind of excitement than that which
   is produced by politics! When a man comes to know Christ and to love
   Him, it wakes him up from the crown of his head to the sole of his
   feet. We steady-going people, you know, try to be very serene and
   quiet, and our worship is apt to get terribly stiff and dull--but if we
   could let our souls have their liberty, if we could speak and sing as
   we feel--what a noise we would make sometimes! There would be
   hallelujahs and hosannas, indeed, and it is amazing that we can
   restrain them, for the Gospel of Christ somehow brings out of a man new
   faculties which he does not know of himself till a glorious breeze of
   Everlasting Life has blown through him! Then odors which otherwise had
   lain asleep, odors such as God delights in, are poured forth on every
   side! This is, indeed, a new song, for it makes us new! God grant, dear
   Friends, that many of you may so continually sing it that you may know
   what I mean--and a great deal more than I can say! That is a wonderful
   thing, then--a new man singing a new song!

   There is yet a further wonder. My Friend, you have been telling us that
   you marvel that you have a new song. What is it that makes you so
   surprised? You have told us much--tell us a little more. And he
   answers, "Well, Sir, I wonder at my new song because it is raised unto
   our God--'even praise unto our God.'" It should not be, but still it
   is, a marvel when a man praises his God. We are by nature so averse to
   this sweet exercise that when we come to do it, and to do it heartily,
   it is a marvelous thing! Look. We praise God's Grace; we sing--

   "Grace! 'Tis a charming sound! Harmonious to the ear!"

   And each saved man among us feels it to be so in his case. We praise
   God's power! What power He has put forth in bringing us up out of our
   graves of sin and turning us from darkness to light and from the power
   of Satan unto God by that same mighty power which He worked in Christ
   when He raised Him from the dead and set Him at His own right hand.
   Yes, every man whom God has saved praises His Grace and His power.

   The pith of the song is this--"praise unto our God." You cannot praise
   another man's God. At least there is no sweetness in such a song. But
   there is a blessed melody when it is "praise unto our God"--our
   Covenant God, the God who belongs to us, the God who by a perpetual
   Covenant has given Himself up to us to be our possession forever--
   "praise unto our God." I like to have it put in the plural. My soul can
   praise my God, but the highest note is reached when many of us,
   together, can praise "our God"--yours and mine! We who are Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ. We who know each other and love each other find a
   peculiar sweetness in our new song when it is "praise unto our God." If
   you all knew the sweetness of bringing others to Christ, more of you
   would live for it and be prepared to even die for it.

   I have had some very happy days in my life, but my happiest times have
   been such as I had one day last week when I shook hands with somewhere
   about a hundred persons who called me their spiritual father. It seemed
   to them to be quite a grand day to touch my hand, while to me, the
   tears standing in my eyes as I saw each one of them--it was as the days
   of Heaven upon earth, for I had never seen all those people before!
   Perhaps some of them had been in this House of Prayer, now and then,
   but I did not know them. They had read the sermons and as I went from
   village to village, and found them standing at their doors, begging me
   to stop just to hear how such a sermon was "blessed to me," and, "my
   old father read your sermons and died in peace after reading
   them"--there, I could have died of joy, for this is the truest
   happiness we can have on earth! Seek sinners, my Brothers and Sisters,
   seek their conversion with all your heart and soul! If you would be
   happy men and women, and would sing the sweetest song that could be
   sung on earth, let it be, "praise unto our God"--not yours alone, but
   the God, also, of those whom Infinite Mercy shall permit you to bring
   to the same dear Savior's feet!

   There is one more wonder about this song and then I shall have finished
   what I have to say about this friend of ours. You tell us that you sing
   and that you sing a new song--what is the greatest wonder about that
   song? "Why, Sir, to tell you the truth, I do not know which is the
   greatest marvel. There is a world of wonders in my singing this new
   song, but there is one point I have not told you, and that is this--'He
   has put a new song in my mouth.'" Oh, I see, then--you did not learn it
   from anybody? You did not make it up yourself? "No, no, no. A thousand
   times, no! It was God that put it into my mouth." Well now, when God
   puts a song into a man's mouth, that is a grand thing, for the devil,
   himself, cannot get it out! If God puts a new song into a man's mouth,
   he has a right to sing it and he ought to sing it--and he must sing
   it--therefore, let him sing it!

   Magnify the Lord if He has done this great thing to you, if He has put
   this new song into your mouth! All that we ever do for ourselves never
   has the sweetness in it of that which God does for us. You may labor
   and toil and tug, and all the wage you get you may hold in the hollow
   of your hand--and it shall melt in the morning sun! But if God shall
   give it to you of His free, rich, Sovereign Grace, it shall be within
   you a well of water springing up into everlasting life! And neither
   life, nor death, nor things present, nor things to come shall ever take
   it away from you! If God has put this new song in your mouth, that is
   the best thing you can tell us about it!

   And so, my good Friend, I will ask you no more questions. Sing away,
   sing away, as long as ever you like! Sing praise unto our God--

   "Sing, though sense and carnal reason Would gladly stop the joyful
   song! Sing and count it highest treason For a saint to hold his
   tongue."

   II. Now, secondly, and very briefly, we have here, dear Friends, A MAN
   WHO IS RESOLVED TO KEEP ON SINGING, for, you notice, he says, "He has
   put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see
   it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." So that this man means to
   keep on singing. I must have you back, again, old Friend, and ask you
   why it is that you mean to keep on singing?

   He answers, first, "Because I cannot help it." When God sets a man
   singing, he must sing! Good Rowland Hill once had, sitting on the
   pulpit stairs, a person who sang with such a cracked, squeaking voice
   that it put the dear man out of heart. And this person with the cracked
   voice, of course, sang more loudly than anybody else! So Mr. Hill said
   to him, while the hymn was being sung, "Be quiet, my good man. You make
   such a dreadful noise that you put us all out." "Oh," said the man, "I
   am singing from my heart, Mr. Hill!" "I beg your pardon, my Friend,"
   said the preacher, "go on, go on, go on with your singing if it comes
   from your heart!"

   So we would not stop any man, whatever his voice is, if he sings from
   his heart! But, what is more, we not only say that we would not stop
   him, but we could not stop him if we wanted to. If, as men say, "murder
   wills out," I am sure that Grace will! You cannot put salvation into a
   bottle and put the cork in! It will burst the bottle, for it must come
   out! If God has put a song into your mouth, you must sing it.
   Therefore, again I say, sing away!

   But, my Friend over yonder, do not sing before everybody--perhaps it
   would be casting pearls before swine. "Oh," he says, "but I must! I
   mean to sing before many." Why? "Well, I used to sing before many in my
   evil days. I was not ashamed to sing for the devil--when I ought to
   have been ashamed, I was not. And now that I ought not to be ashamed, I
   will not be ashamed and I will sing! Besides, why should I be so tender
   and considerate of their nerves? They are not thoughtful about mine."
   The ungodly sometimes complain of us for preaching outdoors. They say
   that it disturbs them. Bless their dear delicacy! What a noise they
   make at night, sometimes, when they keep us from sleeping while they
   noisily declare that they, "won't go home till morning"! Surely, we may
   sing as loudly as they do! And when we sing songs of Zion, we can well
   reply to them that when they are quiet, and will suspend their music,
   we may consider when we will suspend ours!

   Still, my Friend, do you think that it is worth while to sing at this
   rate? "Yes," he says, "I do, for I believe that it is good for them to
   hear it." Do you? What good can it do them? And he answers me thus.
   "Look at your text, Sir, and you will not need to ask me that question!
   What does your text say?" "Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust
   in the Lord." It is good to preach the Gospel, but it is better to
   preach and sing the Gospel! I mean, dear Friends, that if you and I, in
   our daily lives, were to sing the Gospel more--especially by a holy
   cheerfulness of character--we would bring the Truth of God home to a
   great many who now turn aside from it, and do not feel its power! Sing
   of Christ your Lord! Proclaim His love to you! Proclaim how you were
   converted! Tell how He brought you up out of the horrible pit, out of
   the miry clay--and as you do it, others will long to experience the
   same deliverance and so will be drawn to the Savior by your sweet
   testimony to His Grace. There are many more flies caught with honey
   than with vinegar and there are many more sinners brought to Christ by
   the gracious tidings of His love than ever will be driven to Him by all
   the threats of His Law. I do not know a better soul-trap than a happy
   Christian experience! This will catch them--therefore be sure to use
   it. Sing, sing, sing unto the Lord a new song! Sing His praise unto the
   ends of the earth, for many will see it, and fear, and put their trust
   in the Lord!

   If I had come here, tonight, knowing that there were persons here that
   were ailing, and were to say, "Now, listen. I will tell you how I
   suffered from your same illness," you would be sure to attend to me.
   And if I then mentioned a certain remedy, and said, "I took it and I
   have experienced a very remarkable cure," you would listen with both
   ears and you would ask, "Where is that remedy to be purchased?" You
   would begin thinking whether you could get some of it tomorrow morning,
   especially if you were very ill, yourselves, as I had been, and you
   would go away thankful to think that you had met with someone who,
   through his own experience, could guide you to a perfect cure!

   Well now, that is exactly what I want you to do with regard to
   yourselves, you who are sick of sin, and care, and fear, and grief. I,
   too, as a youth, was sick of sin and I was made to feel it--and to
   endure great grief on account of it. I sought to be delivered from it.
   I gave up many things in which I had indulged and I hoped, by
   self-denial, that I would come to peace. But I did not, I was as far
   off as before I began! I said that I would very diligently attend the
   means of Grace and I did so. Thrice on the Sabbath I was found
   somewhere or other hearing the Word of God. But mere sermon-hearing
   brings no peace. Then I said that I would read good books. How I
   remember reading Alleine's Alarm and Doddridge's Rise and Progress, and
   Baxter's Call to the Unconverted. And how they plowed me, and brought
   tears into my eyes--but I found no rest to my soul by all the godly
   books I read--the best that could be read. Whatever was proposed to me
   that looked likely to bring me rest, I was eager to try. I was willing,
   I am sure, to become a monk, or anything else beneath the sun that
   would promise peace to my spirit, for I wanted to be right and longed
   to be at peace with God.

   At last, I found rest. The preacher pictured Christ upon the Cross,
   bleeding for sinners. And he said, in his Lord's own words, "Look unto
   Me and be you saved, all you ends of the earth." And I looked! It was
   all I could do--it was all I was asked to do--I looked! It was but a
   look, yet in that moment all my fears were ended, my doubts were
   solved, my burden was removed, and I, too, could say, "He has put a new
   song in my mouth. He brought me up out of an horrible pit, out of the
   miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings."

   Now, after trying and testing this salvation for a good many
   years--well near on to forty--I have only this to say of it. It is a
   simple salvation, but it is as sound as it is simple! It is fitted for
   the poorest of us, but it is as enriching as it is suitable to our
   poverty! The weakest may look to Jesus, but by looking he shall soon be
   ranked among the strongest! He who is at death's door may look to Jesus
   Crucified, but the life that look brings is life everlasting which
   shall never die! There is the remedy and I have tried it! That is all I
   can say to you except that I beg you to try it yourselves. Try it
   yourselves! Look to Christ. Look to Christ! Trust Jesus, that is
   all--trust, simply trust! It seems as if this could not be all, but it
   is. You with the broken heart, trust! You with the heart that will not
   break, trust to have it broken! You that are deeply penitent,
   trust--not in your repentance, however--but in Christ! And you that can
   not repent, but wish to repent, look to Christ for repentance!

   Trust! Trust! Trust as the drowning man trusts to the life buoy, as the
   shipwrecked mariners trust to the lifeboat. Trust! Trust in God
   Almighty, Incarnate in the bleeding Man of Sorrows, for it is God that
   hangs on the Cross in the body of the Nazarene. Trust in Jesus Christ,
   the Son of God, and the Son of Mary--and as surely as He lives, as
   surely as God lives, you shall live and live forever! Heaven and earth
   may pass away, but that Word shall never pass away, "He that believes
   on the Son has everlasting life." May you have it tonight! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 33; 1 JOHN 1 .

   Verse 1. Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, for praise is comely for
   the upright. False gods were worshipped with dolorous sounds,
   accompanied by cutting with knives and with lances, but our God is the
   happy God and He would have His people happy. "Rejoice in Jehovah, O
   you righteous." The praises of God are very beautiful when they are
   sung by holy people, "for praise is comely for the upright." But the
   praises of God on the lips of godless men are altogether out of place.
   I wonder how Christians can allow those to lead their praises in the
   sanctuary who never can, from their hearts, praise God? They who sing
   to the worldling all the week should not be employed to sing to the God
   of the holy on the Sabbath! Surely, "Praise is comely for the upright."
   Hymns and Psalms sung by the ungodly are but as sweet spices laid upon
   a dunghill--but--"praise is comely for the upright."

   2, 3. Praise the LORD with harps: sing unto Him with the psaltery and
   an instrument of ten strings. Sing unto Him a new song; play skillfully
   with a loud noise. Under a dispensation of types and shadows, the use
   of musical instruments seemed to be necessary and suitable, but in the
   early Christian Church, in her purest ages, these things were discarded
   as tending towards Judaism. And at this day, the sweetest singing in
   the world is heard in the assembly which utterly renounces the use of
   every musical instrument! Yet I believe that there is Christian liberty
   about these things and, for my part, I like to think of Luther with his
   lute and of George Herbert with his harp. If they were helped to praise
   God the better, let them have the music! Yet the singing is never
   sweeter than when it is all song--and there is no better music than
   that which comes from hearts and tongues that are alive--and that know
   what sounds they make and why they make them. Anyhow, let us sing unto
   Jehovah! Hang not your harps on the willows, suspend not your music!
   Praise God somehow, praise Him anyway, but praise Him!

   4. For the Word of the LORD is right. Praise Him for His Word, then. It
   is truth, it is righteousness. If we had nothing else but the Bible for
   which to praise God, there would be reason enough for giving Him
   endless praise for bestowing upon us such a priceless treasure!

   4. And all His works are done in truth. Praise Him for His Providence.
   There is never a mistake in what He does-- "All His works are done in
   truth."

   5. He loves righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
   goodness of the LORD. Therefore praise Him. So good a God should not be
   without your gratitude.

   6. By the Word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of
   them by the breath of His mouth. Praise your Creator, then, the Maker
   of the universe!

   7-9. He gathers the waters of the sea together as an heap: He lays up
   the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the
   inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. For He spoke and it was
   done; He commanded and it stood fast. These are simple but grand words!
   The work of creation was very wonderful and it was all worked by the
   Word of the Lord. There were no angelic agencies. "He spoke and it was
   done; He commanded and it stood fast."

   10. The LORD brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing. They plot
   and they contrive, but He baffles them! Men may think and scheme as
   they will, but God has His way, after all!

   10, 11. He makes the devices of the people of no effect. The counsel of
   the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations.
   His decrees stand fast. Jehovah still reigns and still He must reign
   forever and ever.

   12. Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom He
   has chosen for His own inheritance. There is the reason why they are
   blessed--it is all owing to God's electing love! "The people whom He
   has chosen." If God has chosen them, they are blessed people, indeed!
   Whom He determines to bless none can effectually curse.

   13. The LORD looks from Heaven; He beholds all the sons of men. As we
   look out of a window and see the people passing in the street below,
   "He beholds all the sons of men," whether at the pole or at the
   equator! None are hidden from His Omniscient eyes.

   14. 13. From the place of His habitation He looks upon all the
   inhabitants of the earth. He fashions their hearts alike. Not that
   their hearts are alike, but it means that He only fashions all their
   hearts--they were all made by Him. There is no understanding so great
   but He made it and there is no mind so feeble but still He made it--

   "He fashions their hearts."

   13,16. He considers all their works. There is no king saved by the
   multitude of an host. See what vast companies of soldiers Darius
   gathered together, yet Alexander smote them--and Napoleon led into
   Russia more than half a million of men, yet they melted away like snow!

   16. A mighty man is not delivered by much strength. Sooner or later, he
   dies, however strong he is.

   17. A horse is a vain thing for safety. It throws its rider, or falls
   upon him, or is killed with him.

   17, 18. Neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. Behold, the
   eye of the LORD is upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His
   mercy. Beautiful expression! I always like that mixture of fear and
   hope. An old fisherman used to compare it to his net. "Fear," he said,
   "is the weight that sinks it, and hope is the cork that floats it." To
   make a perfect character, there must he both fear and hope! The man
   that never fears may begin to fear, but he that is all fear is a
   miserable creature. God help him to begin to hope!

   19. To deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.
   When others die of want, the Lord will take care of them that fear Him.
   I remember a story of the siege of Rochelle, when the city was in such
   straits that the people had to eat cats, dogs, rats and all manner of
   filthiness. There was one Christian woman, who, having some stores, fed
   the poor therewith, whereat her friends said she was a fool, for she
   would soon be starving. They asked, "Who is to take care of you when
   all is gone?" She answered, "The Lord will provide for me." At last her
   stores were exhausted. She went to beg from her friends, but they
   refused her. She was nearly famished when, strange to tell (as we put
   it), someone, unknown to her, shot down a sack full of wheat at her
   door! She never knew who it was, and then she said to her friends, "God
   has provided for me," and, while others died, she lived, for she had
   practiced holy charity. She had feared God and given to her
   neighbors--she had not selfishly hoarded what she had--and the Lord
   rewarded her. Let me read these two verses again. "Behold, the eye of
   the Lord is upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy;
   to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine."

   20. Our soul waits for the LORD: He is our help and our shield. Notice
   the three, "ours." Personal possession is the very soul of piety--all
   else is mere verbiage. Not, "What do you hear?" but, "What do you
   have?" Not, "What do you talk about?" but, "What do you possess?" That
   is the thing--"Our soul waits for the Lord: He is our help and our
   shield."

   21. For our heart shall rejoice in Him because we have trusted in His
   holy name. If you do but trust in His holy name, you shall, one day,
   rejoice in Him. Trust Him in the dark and you shall see the Light of
   God! Trust Him in famine and you shall surely be fed.

   22. Let Your mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in You.
   Let us each one pray that prayer now--"Let Your mercy, O Lord, be upon
   us, according as we hope in You." Amen. Now turn to the First Chapter
   of the First Epistle of John, that you may see what an Apostle had to
   say concerning joy.

   1 John 1:1. That which was from the beginning which we have heard,
   which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
   hands have handled, of the Word of Life. You know who that is, who it
   is that John had heard, seen, looked upon and handled even Jesus
   Christ, our Lord and Savior!

   2, 3. (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
   witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the
   Father, and was manifested unto us), that which we have seen and heard
   declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us and
   truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.
   The Father delights in His risen Son, no more to suffer and to die,
   having accomplished all His work. And I am sure that we have fellowship
   with the Father in that rejoicing! Then think what is the joy of
   Christ, who has passed through the shades of death, and risen from all
   the gloom of the sepulcher no more to die! I trust, dear Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ, that we have fellowship with Him, for we, also, have
   risen with Him unto newness of life!

   4. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
   "There," the Apostle seems to say, "if you have doubts, they will kill
   your joy. Doubt is a great joy-killer, but we have seen Him, we have
   heard Him, we have handled Him who is the Fountain of all true joy! Let
   no doubts come into your hearts, for these are well-attested facts of
   which we speak. "We live still," says John--though, perhaps, when he
   wrote, he may have been the last survivor of the eleven--"we live
   still, by our testimony concerning Christ, to confirm your faith, that
   your joy may be full."

   5-7. This, then, is the message which we have heard of Him, and declare
   unto you, that God is Light, and in Him is no darkness at all. If we
   say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie, and
   do not say the truth: but if we walk in the light, as He is in the
   Light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus
   Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. That is, if we walk in the
   brightest light we can ever know, and if our fellowship with God is the
   highest that can be enjoyed this side Heaven, we shall still need the
   cleansing blood of Jesus and, blessed be God, we shall still have it
   and we shall still find that it "cleanses us from all sin!''

   8. If we say that we have no sin., we deceive ourselves, and the truth
   is not in us. We are walking in darkness when we thus talk of light. It
   is easy for a blind man to talk of light though he cannot see it and
   there are some who boast of very superior light who, nevertheless, are
   so much in the dark that they cannot even see their own sin.

   9, 10. If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have
   not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us. The Lord
   bless to us the reading of his Word! Amen.

Self-destroyed, Yet Saved

   (No. 2425)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 11, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST
   11, 1887.

   "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself; but in Me is your help." Hosea
   13:9.

   IT would be a very important subject for our meditation if we kept to
   the text and thought upon its great Truth of God--that the ruin of man
   is altogether of himself and the salvation of man is altogether of God.
   These two statements, I believe, comprehend the main points of a sound
   theology. There have been divisions in the Church over these points
   where there ought not to have been any. The Calvinist has said and said
   right bravely, that salvation is of Grace alone. And the Arminian has
   said and said most truthfully, that damnation is of man's will, alone,
   and as the result of man's sin, and of that only. Then they have fallen
   out with one another. The fact is, they had, each one, laid hold of a
   Truth of God, and if they could have put their heads together and
   accepted both Truths, it might have been greatly for the advantage of
   the Church of Christ! These two doctrines are like tram lines that you
   can travel on with safety and comfort, these parallel lines--ruin, of
   man; restoration, of God. Sin, of man's will; salvation, of God's will.
   Reprobation, of man's demerit; election, of God's free and Sovereign
   Grace. The sinner lost in Hell through himself, alone, the saint lifted
   up to Heaven wholly and alone by the power and Grace of God!

   Get those two Truths of God thoroughly engraved upon your heart and you
   will then hold comprehensively the great Truths of Scripture. You will
   not need to crowd them into one narrow system of theology, but you will
   have a sort of duplicate system which will contain, as far as the mind
   of man, being finite, can contain--the great Truths revealed by the
   Infinite God. I am not, however, at this time going so much into the
   doctrinal point as to try and make use of my text for practical
   soul-saving purposes.

   You notice in this text, "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself," how
   God comes to close terms with men. He speaks, calling the persons
   addressed by name, "O Israel," and then He uses a singular pronoun,
   "you have destroyed yourself." It is something like Nelson's way of
   fighting. When he came alongside the enemy, he brought his ship as
   close as he could, and then sent in a devastating broadside from stem
   to stern! So does this text--it seems to get alongside of the man, puts
   its guns right close up to him, and then discharges its volley--"O
   Israel, you have destroyed yourself."

   There is nothing said here that is at all flattering--"you have
   destroyed yourself." God bids a man look at himself as a blighted,
   blasted, ruined thing when He tells him that he is a self-destroyer! He
   has done it all! He has no need to ask, as Jesus did, "Who slew all
   these?" Your own red right hand has done it! O you guilty sinner, you
   have ruined yourself! See how plainly God speaks, how He lays judgment
   to the line and righteousness to the plummet, and with His storm of
   hail sweeps away all refuges of lies--"O Israel, you have destroyed
   yourself."

   But though He does not flatter, observe that the Lord does not conclude
   His address to the sinner by leaving him in despair, for the second
   part of the text is, "In Me is your help." We should never so preach
   the Law as to show only the naked sword of Divine Justice--the sweet
   invitations and promises of the Gospel must come in after the dreadful
   verdict of judgement! Let the thunders roll, let the lightning set the
   heavens on fire, but conclude not till some silver drops have fallen
   and a shower of mercy has refreshed the thirsty earth! No, God will not
   have us preach only the Law and its terrors, but the Gospel must also
   be brought into our message--"You have destroyed yourself, O Israel:
   there is no concealing from you that grim and terrible fact. But in Me
   is your help: there is no keeping back from you that cheering and
   blessed information!" When these two things work together, breeding
   self-despair and hope in God, this is the way by which eternal life is
   worked in the souls of men!

   I am going to speak, then, of those two themes and first, here is a sad
   fact--"O Israel, you have destroyed yourself." Secondly, here is a
   hopeful assurance--"In Me is your help." And, before I finish, I wish
   to notice, in the third place, an instructive warning which is given by
   this text as you read it in the Revised Version--"It is your
   destruction, O Israel, that you are against Me, against your Help." It
   is a warning to men not to fight against their own salvation, or
   contend against the only Helper who can aid them to any purpose!

   I. First, then, here is A SAD FACT--"O Israel, you have destroyed
   yourself."

   Now, dear Friends, I believe that there is a message here to every one
   of us. The text speaks in tones of thunder to each unconverted person
   and says, "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself." But if any child of
   God has lost his first love, his joy, his comfort--if he has become a
   backslider--if he has fallen into a sad, melancholy condition, he has
   done it himself and the text tells him so! "O Israel, you have
   destroyed yourself." If there is about any of us that which we have to
   mourn over by reason of an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the
   living God, the text puts its finger on the sore, and says, "you have
   destroyed yourself! You have, yourself, done all this mischief."

   But, addressing myself mainly to those who do not as yet know the Lord,
   I want you, dear Friends, to notice that this sad fact stared Israel in
   the face--"O Israel, you have destroyed yourself." He could see it, he
   could feel it, he could not escape from knowing it, for this was the
   singular fact--that God Himself seemed to have turned against him. I
   read you, just now, those seventh and eighth verses where God says, "I
   will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe
   them: I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and
   will tear open their rib cage, and there will I devour them like a
   lion: the wild beast shall tear them."

   It happens to some men, as it has happened to many who have come under
   my observation, that they have gone on pleasantly in sin for a time,
   till, all of a sudden, the hand of God has gone out against them. They
   have been smitten with sickness--those same strong young fellows who
   never had any sickness and who thought that they could indulge their
   passions to the utmost without fear--have been, all of a sudden, laid
   low. Perhaps the hand of God has gone out against them in business.
   They were prospering. They added field to field. They could afford to
   spend money freely in various ways, but, by-and-by, the stream of
   business began to run low and then to dry up altogether! What they
   attempted did not prosper however hard they labored. They rose up
   early, they sat up late, they ate the bread of carefulness--but all
   went amiss with them. Whatever they did seemed to have a blight upon
   it. Truly, God met them as a lion and as a bear bereaved of her whelps!

   At such a time as this, the man begins to see that there must be
   something wrong with him. He did not know it, be-fore--perhaps he even
   thought that his prosperity was a proof that God was not angry with
   him! And he went on from sin to sin and said within himself, "Why, I do
   not suffer even as Christian people do! Surely, I must be right, after
   all, for I increase in riches and my eyes stand out with fatness." Oh,
   if you are one of God's chosen, there will come to you a day of
   darkness in which you shall not see your way along the road of sin! God
   will hedge up your path with thorns and dig deep ditches in your
   way--and you shall stumble and fall--and then shall you say, "I
   perceive that something is amiss with me. I see that I am on the wrong
   track. Oh, how shall I escape, how shall I get onto the right road?"

   I say, again, when a man is in that condition, as Israel was in my
   text, then his sad state stares him in the face! You cannot convince
   the worldling that he is in an evil case when he is living without God
   and yet prospering! Oh, no--he is satisfied as long as he gets the
   things of this world--what cares he for the world to come? Therefore,
   one of the first means that God uses to awaken men from the dangerous
   slumber of their natural estate is to go to war with them and to be
   like one who is cruel to them--that He may tear them away from
   themselves and from their follies.

   Notice, next, that while this grief stared them in the face, it was
   attributed to themselves, it lay at their own door-- "O Israel, you
   have destroyed yourself." There is always hope for a man when he knows
   this and confesses this. The worst of it is that, by nature, we lay our
   ruin at anybody's door but our own! "It was all the fault of our family
   environment-- how can we help it? It was God's purpose, or it was the
   devil's temptation." We put the saddle anywhere but on the right horse!
   We will not accept this great and certain Truth, "O Israel, you have
   destroyed yourself." Now, you can be sure of this, O Man, that the sin
   which will ruin you is your own sin! That for which you will suffer,
   that for which you do suffer is the sin which you, yourself, have
   committed--the evil which you have willfully committed! There are some
   to whom this Truth of God has a special reference. Let me see whether I
   can identify them.

   There are some of us who went into sin without any previous training
   whatever! Some of us were born of Christian parents and our earliest
   days were spent in a holy circle. We heard no evil language, we saw no
   evil example, we cannot remember anything that was wrong that crossed
   our path as children. Yet we went astray from childhood unto youth,
   pursuing evil as eagerly as did the children of the vicious! Wherever
   this is the case, does not the text come home with great sharpness, "O
   Israel, you have destroyed yourself"? You cannot say, "The fathers have
   eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge." You have
   eaten the sour grapes, yourselves, and set your own teeth on edge!
   Perhaps some, here, are the children of Christian ministers and they
   know where they spent last night--I do not. Perhaps some, here, were
   borne and trained by mothers whose purity was most exemplary--but they,
   themselves, though they never had an evil example, have plunged into
   sin as naturally as the young crocodile takes to the Nile! This is,
   with an emphasis, for a man to destroy himself!

   So there are some who are not the victims of temptation, but they have
   deliberately gone into sin. I feel great pity for some that, from their
   peculiar constitution, seem as if their very flesh led their soul into
   mischief--from their birth they appeared to have a tendency towards
   such and such evils. We do not excuse these guilty ones, but, at the
   same time, are they as blameworthy as others who, without any
   particular pressure from outside or from within, nevertheless
   deliberately sin? Oh, my dear Friends, if you can sit down and look at
   sin coolly, and calculate and turn it over, and then, after weighing it
   in the scales, can go after it, then I must say, "O Israel, you have
   destroyed yourself." Yours was wanton, deliberate mischief! Who shall
   justify you before the bar of God at the great Judgment Day?

   There are some who have to take a great deal of plotting and planning
   in order to be able to manage to sin at all. Their surroundings are
   such that they seem to be shielded and guarded against iniquities which
   are natural enough to others. They have to dodge the inspection of the
   household. They have to practice as many tricks to escape the eyes of
   wife or daughter as the burglar does when he tries to break into the
   house at night. Now, what shall I say of such who put all their wits to
   work to damn their souls--and are far more busy to ruin themselves than
   the greatest schemers and merchants are for a fortune? Yet there are
   many such and of these we have to say emphatically, "O Israel, you have
   destroyed yourself."

   Yes, and I have even seen them act thus against warnings given them
   with tears, warnings which have brought tears to their own eyes! They
   have pushed through the most loving obstacles downward to the Pit as if
   resolved to perish! And they have sinned against enlightenment, for Mr.
   Conscience has flashed his bull's-eye lantern in their eyes. They have
   stood, for a time, astonished at themselves, and have felt that they
   could not sin thus, yet they have soon said that they would--and they
   have pushed good Mr. Conscience to one side--and still pursued the
   downward track. Oh, this is terrible! When a man acts thus, we must say
   of him, "you have destroyed yourself."

   Some will act thus distinctly against Providence. When God has stepped
   in their path and blocked them out of one sin, they have edged about,
   and gone to another! And when they could not effect their purpose. When
   it seemed as if the very earth and the stars in their courses would
   fight against them in their pursuit of sin, they have selected another
   road as if to baffle the God of mercy and destroy themselves whether He
   would let them do so or not! I am giving a terrible description, but I
   am painting sinners exactly as they are--I know I am! There are some
   here who will recognize their own portraits if they have any eyes
   left--"O Israel, you have destroyed yourself."

   Further, notice that in the text, God, Himself, reminds the sinner of
   this sad fact! Ought he not to have known it without being told of it?
   Yes, he should. Might he not have discovered it by listening to the
   Prophets who would have told him so? Assuredly he should! But God,
   Himself, breaks through all reserve and comes to this guilty
   sinner--and says to him, "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself. See
   what has come of your iniquity? Did I not tell you it would be so?
   Look, and see for yourself." It is not a man like yourself who tells
   you that it is so, but God who knows! God who never exaggerates! He
   tells you that you have destroyed yourself!

   O my dear Hearer, it may be that while I am speaking to you in truth
   and soberness about this weighty matter, God, Himself, is speaking
   through my lips! Indeed, it is so! It is the Lord who says to you, "you
   have destroyed yourself; you have destroyed your innocence, you have
   destroyed your righteousness, you have destroyed your tenderness, you
   have well-near destroyed your conscience, you have destroyed your
   hopes, you have destroyed your best years, you have destroyed your
   usefulness, and now you have brought yourself to death's dark door--

   "'Buried in sorrow and in sin."

   God Himself can say no less than this to you, "you have destroyed
   yourself." God who loves men. God the tenderhearted and the generous.
   God who says, "How can I give you up?" Even He is forced to give this
   solemn verdict, "O Israel, you have not only hurt yourself, and wounded
   yourself, but you have damned yourself, you have destroyed yourself,
   you have ruined yourself! Your last hope is put out, like the last
   flicker of the candle, and you are left in the dark."

   It may be that some here will confess the truth of this fact. If so,
   bow your heads--solemnly bow before the living God and acknowledge that
   it is so, "Yes, I have destroyed myself." It will be a bitter, bitter
   moment, and yet it will be the best moment you have ever lived, in
   which you sob out this confession, "O God, I have destroyed myself!"
   How I wish that I could make men act thus, but I cannot. We try to
   preach the Truth of God with all the earnestness we possess, but we
   cannot get the Truth into our hearer's soul! On such a sultry night as
   this, you sit and listen to me with as much attention as you can in the
   closeness of the atmosphere, but O ungodly one, if this Truth of God
   really entered your heart, I question whether you would be able to keep
   your seat! It would fill you with an inward anguish and you would be
   ready to cry aloud, "What shall I do, what shall I do, for I have
   ruined myself?" If you could see the pit that yawns for you. If you saw
   the chasm that is just before you--your foot is even now well-near over
   a bottomless gulf, yet you do not perceive it--if you did perceive it,
   it would be another matter for me to preach, and for you to hear this
   message, "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself!"

   II. I am very happy to be permitted by my text to now change my strain,
   praying that what has been already said may have its due effect and
   prepare the way for this more pleasing note. Here is, secondly, A
   HOPEFUL ASSURANCE-- "But in Me is your help."

   Notice that this assurance came at a very fit time. Just when the man
   was made to know that he had destroyed himself, then it was that God
   said to him, "But in Me is your help." What is the use of a Savior when
   you do not need saving? The point is to have a Savior when you are
   lost! And this is the glory of Christ, that He is a timely Redeemer who
   does not redeem those who are not slaves, but ransoms us when we are
   sold under sin! You will never know the Gospel till you have known the
   Law. If you have not felt the crushing power of the first sentence of
   my text, "you have destroyed yourself," you will not care for the
   cheering note that makes up the second sentence, "In Me is your help."
   Remember that when you have sinned--it is then that Christ washes you
   from sin. When you are lost, it is then that Christ saves you and if
   you are now full of sin, it is now that Christ can begin to bless you!
   If you now feel so leprous that there is not a sound spot in you, it is
   now that Christ can come and heal you!

   "Oh!" you say, "if I did not feel as I now do, I think that Christ
   could heal me." He can heal you as you now feel, or as you do not
   feel--for if you are in such a condition that you do not even feel, but
   are brought to acknowledge that death has seized you, and seems to have
   petrified your very heart--yet where you are, and as you are, Christ is
   an all-sufficient Savior for you! If you have gone down seven pairs of
   stairs into the dungeon where the light never comes, yet Jesus can come
   to you, even there, and set you free at once! I do not know where to
   pick words strong enough to make this Truth of God quite plain and
   emphatic--it is not your goodness that makes you fit for Christ--it is
   your badness in which Christ shall be glorified by delivering you from
   it! The need may never be so great, but Christ can meet it! The
   distress may be never so urgent, but Christ can come and remove it! So,
   then, this assurance was hopeful because it came at a fit time. When
   Israel was destroyed, then God was his help!

   Notice, next, that it came as a contrast to their condition--"you have
   destroyed yourself." Yes, yes, "but--but in Me is your help." "You have
   destroyed yourself. You can not save yourself. You have destroyed
   yourself, that is true, but then I have come, not to destroy you--not
   to do the work which you have done--you have done that effectually
   enough. There is no need for Me to come in and do more destroying. I
   have come to undo the work that you have done. I have come to give you
   a better righteousness than the one you have lost. I have come to give
   you a tenderness of heart far better than any you had by nature. I am
   come to give you a new heart and a right spirit. I am come to work in
   you, again, all that you have destroyed! Yes, and to work in you
   something better than you have destroyed--to make you a new man in
   Christ Jesus. In Me is your help." What a contrast is this to the
   condition of the one who has destroyed himself!

   Observe, also, that this assurance comes from God, Himself--"In Me is
   your help." O Soul, I wish that I could make you turn your eyes, once
   and for all, away from yourself and all that comes of yourself, for you
   will never get help there! I would have you look to God, to God in
   Christ Jesus, to God the Holy Spirit, to God the Divine Father--for if
   ever there is help for such an one as you are, that help must be in
   God! As an old friend said to me yesterday, "Nothing will do for you
   and me but Grace." I said to him, "Yes, and that won't do unless it is
   the Grace of God." It must be God's own Grace, redeeming us from all
   iniquity and working in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure,
   or else we can never be saved! But then God tells us that we can be
   saved, for though He says that we have destroyed ourselves, He adds,
   "But in Me is your help."

   Sitting in the pew, over yonder, is one who says, "Oh, but I am full of
   the most accursed sin!" I know that you are, but God is full of the
   most blessed mercy and in Him is your help! "Oh, but I am all failure,
   and shortcoming, and unrighteousness!" Yes, but God is all
   righteousness, and Grace, and faithfulness--and there is where your
   hope lies! "Oh, but I am powerless! I can do nothing!" I know that and
   I would have you know it--but the Lord is almighty and He can do
   everything! Cast yourself upon Him! This is faith--to go out of
   yourself to God, to get away from all this hampering mass of
   rottenness, this ruin, this destruction, the fallen manhood of the
   flesh and the self-confidence that grows like a fungus out of it--and
   come to the eternal God who is pure holiness--and rest in Him as He
   reveals Himself in the Person of His dear Son!

   "I know," says one, "that there is help in God." You know something,
   but you do not yet know everything, for the text says, "In Me is your
   help." Not only for Mary and for Thomas, but help for you. "In Me is
   your help." "Surely," exclaims one, "it does not mean me, for I am a
   destroyed one." I tell you that it means exactly you, for this help is
   for the destroyed one--"You have destroyed yourself, but in Me is your
   help." "Possibly there may be help for So-and-So, who has a good
   natural disposition and has never gone astray as I have gone." That may
   be. I do not know anything about him, but I have to deal with one, now,
   who has no good natural disposition and nothing whatever to recommend
   him. I have to deal with you, you destroyed one, you who are like an
   old ruin, broken and cast down, inhabited by moles and bats, a foul and
   filthy thing! You stand in the darkness, there, and it is Christ who
   comes to rebuild such as you are and make a Temple for Himself out of
   even you! I see you black and foul, not worthy to be picked off a
   dunghill, and it is such as you are that the splendor of Almighty Love
   has chosen, that in you, in all your rottenness and abomination, the
   glory of His Grace may be manifested by making something out of you
   though you are nothing--making a glorious righteousness to cover you
   though you are naked--and your very righteousnesses are but as filthy
   rags!

   "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself." Bury him! Bury the dead out of
   our sight! Cast him into the pit! "No," says Mercy, "stop that dreadful
   procession! Let the bearers stand still. Christ comes to this dead
   young man and He says, 'you have destroyed yourself; but in Me is your
   help.'" Look, the dead man lives! I see him sit upright! He is
   delivered to his mother and God is glorified in the resurrection of the
   dead. "You have destroyed yourself; but in Me is your help."

   What do you say, Sinner? Will you have this help? "Have it?" you ask.
   "Have it? Yes, but I am not worthy." Now, away with that nonsense! Have
   I not told you that the Lord comes to bless you not because of you
   worthiness, but because of His Grace? "What am I to do to have it?" You
   have nothing to do but take it! He freely gives it to you! "But surely
   there is something expected of me." You are a fool if you expect
   anything of yourself but sin! All your expectation of good must be from
   God! You may expect great things of God, and then there will be great
   things worked in you, but what you have to do now is just to accept the
   infinite mercy of God and submit to Him as the clay on the wheel yields
   to the hand of the potter, that He may mold and fashion you, and make
   you to be a vessel of mercy fitted for His use.

   God bless these words of mine to the salvation of some of you! I
   travail in birth for you till Christ is formed in you. I remember times
   when, if I had heard such an assuring word as this, when I was burdened
   with guilt and full of fears, I think I would have leaped forward to
   lay hold upon it! And if there are any such here, this message should
   be as though a rift were made in the clouds to let them see into
   Heaven. "In Me is your help," says Christ on yonder eternal Throne! "In
   Me is your help," says the Father in the splendor of His Glory! "In Me
   is your help," says the Spirit who, like a dove, is hovering here,
   waiting to enter into some heart and work His gracious will!

   III. I close with what I mentioned to you, the rendering of the Revised
   Version, which has much to be said in its favor. This gives us AN
   INSTRUCTIVE WARNING--"It is your destruction, O Israel, that you are
   against Me, against your help."

   Dear Friends, do not any of you fight against your only true Helper? Is
   not this a dreadful thing for anyone to do? We sometimes say of a man,
   "Now, you are standing in your own light. You know that it is only
   yourself that is hindering yourself." We say this to the drunk who is
   earning good wages, and yet spending so much of his money in poisoning
   himself. We say to him, "You cannot keep on like this. You are ruining
   your health, you are robbing your family, you cannot prosper while you
   act thus, you are standing in your own light." It is a very sad thing
   when this is the fact concerning a man's temporal prosperity, but what
   shall I say of a man when he is his own soul's destroyer, when he
   stands in the way of his own joy and peace through believing?

   Let me close by beseeching you not to stand in your own light, any of
   you, or to act in antagonism to your only Helper. "How can we do that?"
   says one. Well, first, by disbelieving the Gospel. I have seen some do
   this very foolishly. I heard one say, the other day, "Well now, that is
   a very precious Gospel. I think, somehow, that I could believe it if it
   were not so good as it is, but it seems too good to be true!" Well, if
   you keep on with that kind of talk, you will be very foolish, you will
   be standing in your own light! Suppose somebody were to come to your
   house and say to you, "You know such a mansion." "Yes." "You know that
   it has a beautiful park around it." "Yes." "Well, I have brought you
   the title-deeds of that estate. I am going to make you a present of
   it."

   Perhaps you would smile and say, "There are a great many practical
   jokes being played nowadays, and I suppose this is one of them." But
   suppose that this person said, "No, this is a reality, it is no joke,
   it is a fact. Here are the title-deeds of this estate made out in your
   name." Suppose that, month after month, you said, "It is too good to be
   true"? You would be very unwise. I think that if it were said to me, I
   would go and see, for I would say, "There are so many strange things
   that happen, nowadays, that one begins to expect the unexpected and, at
   any rate, I would sooner be made a fool of by being led to believe
   something more than is true, than I would make a fool of myself by not
   believing what is really true!"

   If you were shut up in a prison, condemned to die tomorrow morning, and
   expected that at eight o'clock you would be hanged by the neck till you
   were dead--if someone stood at the prison door and said to you, "Here
   is a free pardon for you," I can imagine your saying, "Don't tantalize
   me. It is too good to be true!" But if you actually went out to be
   hanged, refusing the pardon because you thought that it was too good to
   be true--well, I do not know what I would say of you. The Gospel cannot
   be too good to be true! Whatever God says must be grandly good! It must
   be divinely, infinitely good! Do you believe it? Do not quarrel with
   God's mercy because it is so great! Little mercy could not serve your
   turn. Therefore, do not cry out against it because it is so great, but
   come and accept it cheerfully, and say, "God be thanked for it! I will
   gladly receive this great favor which He so freely presents to me."

   Then, do not fight against God by trifling with His mercy. How often
   are persons impressed and awakened, yet they go straight into some
   silly or even wicked company! It is a terrible thing for some people
   that on the Sabbath they are often rendered serious by what they hear,
   and then on the weekday they go into amusements which distract them
   from better things and lead them on to evil things. And so the good
   Word of God is forgotten. Their goodness is as the morning cloud and as
   the early dew. What have any of you to do with mirth while you are
   unsaved? What have you to do with sightseeing till you have seen your
   Savior? There is not a moment you ought to waste, not an hour that you
   can spare, till you have found Christ and are saved in the Lord with an
   everlasting salvation!

   Lastly, I pray you, do not fight against your best Friend, or contend
   against your only Helper by hardening your hearts. Ask to have them
   softened. Better still, whether hardened or softened, obey that blessed
   Gospel precept, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved." Remember how He, Himself, puts the matter, "He that believes
   and is baptized shall be saved." Or as Paul put it, "If you shall
   confess with your mouth, the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your
   heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved. For
   with the heart, man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth,
   confession is made unto salvation." Obey the heavenly message! Pause
   not, hesitate not, but hasten to obey the voice of Christ! And when
   this is done, then you shall find that despite your self-destruction,
   help enough was laid up in God even for you--and you shall sing forever
   to the praise of His Free and Sovereign Grace.

   The Lord bless you, and this simple testimony of mine, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HOSEA 13:1-14.

   Verse 1. When Ephraim spoke trembling, he exalted himself in Israel.
   When we are little in our own esteem. When we are full of fears
   concerning ourselves. When we dare not think of boasting, then it is
   that we grow! "When Ephraim spoke trembling, he exalted himself in
   Israel."

   1. But when he offended in Baal, he died. It is when, like Ephraim, we
   turn aside to other gods, when our heart goes astray from the Lord,
   that there is death--death to our joys, death to our confidence, death
   to our usefulness. No one knows what destruction there is, even in the
   least sin, to the most joyful Believer. It is like the hot breath of
   the Sirocco which scorches up every green thing. If, before this
   terrible blast, everything is like Eden, behind it all is as a desert.
   Let us read the whole verse again that we may lay to heart the lesson
   it teaches us. "When Ephraim spoke trembling, he exalted himself in
   Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died."

   2. And now they sin more and more. That is the usual way of sin--it is
   a growing evil--its course is downhill.

   2. And have made there molten images of their silver, and idols
   according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the
   craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the
   calves. Their idolatry was such that they were not satisfied with the
   bulls that were set on high as images, but they had little imitations
   of these which they wore upon their persons, just as Romanists wear
   small crucifixes or crosses. These they carried about with them for
   their own private worship. Oh, what a tendency there is in sin to
   multiply itself! The idolaters were not satisfied with bowing the knee
   to false gods, but they said, "Let the men that sacrifice kiss the
   calves." Superstition goes from one evil to another--there is no end to
   it! You may begin with what you call moderate Ritualism, but where you
   will end I cannot tell. Some go beyond the superstitions of Popery,
   itself! The only safe way is to worship the Lord our God and serve Him,
   alone, and purge out the idols from among us.

   3. Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew
   that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of
   the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. If they make idols
   their gods, they shall be like their idols! Idols are but for a
   day--what is there in them of endurance? What is there in them of
   power? "They that make them are like unto them, so is everyone that
   trusts in them." If we trust in anything that we can see. If we trust
   in anything but God, then our hope shall be "as the morning cloud, and
   as the early dew that passes away," and we, ourselves, shall be like
   the chaff that is driven from the threshing floor by a whirlwind, or
   like the smoke driven out of the chimney by the blast!

   4. Yet I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt, and you shall
   know no god but Me: for there is no Savior beside Me. Now here is the
   wickedness of idolatry--that we have so good a God and yet must look
   after another! Here is the sin of trusting to an arm of flesh--that we
   have an almighty arm to lean upon and instead of doing so, we begin to
   look to a poor arm that has not strength enough to support itself, much
   less to support us! Are any of you children of God forgetting your God?
   Is your faith turning away from the great Invisible and the sure
   promises of His Word? Are you looking to the creature? Beware of it, I
   pray you! Whenever you do that, you are making a rod for your own back!
   If you forsake the Lord, to whom will you go?

   5. I did know you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. Look
   back upon days of your trouble, when God was very near to you. Do you
   not remember when He was everything to you? When you were poor, when
   you were sick, when you were despised, God knew you, then, yet now you
   sing--

   "What peaceful hours I once enjoyed, How sweet their memory still!"

   6. According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled,
   and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten Me. What a
   terrible verse this is! After they had been filled, they turned away
   from the God that filled them! When they were poor and despised, then
   He was all to them! But afterwards, when, by His Providence, they grew
   rich and increased in goods, then they forgot their God. I have often
   seen it thus. It is a grievous evil under the sun. I have seen the man
   rejoicing in God, earnest and devout while he has been afflicted and
   poor. God has prospered him and then he has turned his back upon sacred
   things and made the world his joy. Is not this a horrible sin, a gross
   evil? I well remember one who used to steal into this House of Prayer
   on Thursday nights, glad to escape, a while, from the persecution in
   his own home. He had a hard time of it to be a Christian at all, but he
   came to be the possessor of his father's estates and he has now no care
   for these things! He is a fashionable gentleman, now--he who once was
   glad enough to mix with even the poorest of God's people and to find
   comfort among them! It is a sad thing when it is so and when the Lord
   has to say to any, "I did know you in the wilderness, in the land of
   great drought. They were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore
   have they forgotten Me."

   7, 8. Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way
   will I observe them: I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her
   whelps, and I will tear open their rib cage, and there will I devour
   them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them. For God is jealous
   and most jealous of those whom He loves best! He cannot endure that we
   should treat Him thus--He means to have our love by some means--and if
   He cannot have it by gentleness, He will have it by sterner methods. If
   the Lord has chosen you, He will sooner be to you as a leopard and a
   lion than He will suffer you to live without Him. You must, you shall
   find your all in Him!

   9, 10. O Israel, you have destroyed yourself; but in Me is your help. I
   will be your King. If you have shifted Me from the Throne and set up an
   usurper, I will come and be your King even now.

   10. Where is any other that may save you in all your cities? To whom
   else can you look? Where else can you find peace?

   10. And your judges of whom you said, Give me a king and princes? What
   is the good of them? Have they not all turned out to be a delusion?

   11, 12. I gave you a king in My anger, and took him away in my wrath.
   The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid. How sadly true
   this is! Sin seems to be bound up in our very nature. It is hard to
   find it--it is hidden away and when we discover some of it, and it is
   purged away--there is still more to be found! As hidden treasure may
   lie in a house for many a day and not be seen, so are there stores of
   corruption that seem hidden away in our nature, and are not easily
   discovered. What a gracious God we have to deal with, or else He would
   have swept us away long ago!

   13, 14. The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an
   unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking
   forth of children. I will ransom them from the power of the grave. Oh,
   what great promises we get driven, like piles, into the marshes of our
   sin to make a foundation for God's Grace! Here, when the Lord says that
   we have destroyed ourselves and He notes all the blackness of our
   depravity, then He comes in with this gracious word, "I will ransom
   them from the power of the grave." You who believe in Jesus shall not
   die! No, not even the deadly force of sin shall hold you in your grave!
   There is a resurrection for the dead. There is a spiritual resurrection
   for you, Believers! When you mourn your death and cry, "O wretched man
   that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" the Lord
   will answer you, "I will ransom you from the power of the grave."

   14. I will redeem them from death: O Death, I will be your plagues; O
   Grave, I will be your destruction: repentance shall be hid from My
   eyes. Lord, work this quickening in Your people, tonight, and let us
   live in the fullness of Your Divine Love, and so anticipate the day
   when our bodies, also, shall be raised by Your glorious power!

A Prayer for Revival

   (No. 2426)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 18, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 14, 1887.

   "Will You not revive us again that Your people may rejoice in You"
   Psalm 85:6.

   BRETHREN, if you will pray this prayer, it will be better than my
   preaching from it! And my only motive in preaching from it is that you
   may pray it. Oh, that at once, before I have uttered more than a few
   sentences, we might begin to pray by crying, yes, groaning deep down in
   our souls," Will You not revive us again that Your people may rejoice
   in You?"

   Notice the style of the praying here--it is in the form of a question
   and in the shape of a plea. There are very few words and none that can
   be spared. Godly men, when they prayed of old, meant it! They did not
   pray for form's sake, neither were they very particular about uttering
   goodly words and fine-sounding sentences--they came to close grips with
   God. They questioned Him, they pleaded with Him. They drove home the
   nail and tried to clinch it. I see that in the very shape of the
   prayer, "Will You not--will You not--will You not revive us again that
   Your people may rejoice in You?" Oh, that we knew how to pray! I fear
   that we do not. We are missing the sacred art, we are losing the
   heavenly mystery--we are but apprentice hands in prayer. Compared with
   such a man as John Knox, whose prayers were worth more than an army of
   ten thousand men, or compared with the prayers of Luther, how few of us
   can pray!

   Luther was a man of whom they said, as they pointed at him in the
   street, "There goes a man who can have anything he likes to ask of
   God." He was the man who, by his prayer, dragged Melancthon back from
   the very gates of death and, what was more, the man who could shake
   upon her seven hills the harlot of Rome as she never had been shaken
   before, because he was mighty with God in prayer! Oh, that I could but
   stir up my Brothers and Sisters to be instant in season and out of
   season, if there is such a thing as out of season with God in prayer!
   Let us get away to our closets! Let us cry mightily to Him! Let us come
   to close quarters with Him and say, "Will You not revive us again that
   Your people may rejoice in You?

   I. To come at once to the text, let us ask, WHAT IS THE TIME FOR SUCH A
   PRAYER AS THIS?

   We shall have to look at the Psalm, itself, to help us in the answer.
   What is the time for offering such a prayer as this? It is, dear
   Friends, when we can remember some gracious acts of God in the past.
   Read--"Lord, You have been favorable unto Your land. You have brought
   back the captivity of Jacob...Will You not revive us again that Your
   people may rejoice in You?" Ah, now, some of you can remember grand
   times, when you were younger than you now are, when the Lord was
   present with His people in a very glorious fashion--when He laid bare
   His arm and the people were made to feel His Divine Presence in the
   preaching of the Word. Do you remember it? The 44th Psalm begins, "We
   have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us what work You
   did in their days, in the times of old." None of us can remember the
   early Methodist days--they were over before we were born--but they were
   very wonderful times when the preaching of the Word of God was like
   fire in the midst of the people!

   [Our friends need not be troubled by the flying of a dove. It will soon
   go out of the window, no doubt. Let us believe that it has come as a
   messenger of good. Oh, that the blessed Dove would, Himself, come from
   Heaven and bring salvation in His wings!]

   Well, I was saying that those first Methodist times were brave days, so
   our fathers have told us, though we cannot remember them. But some of
   you can remember when you were members of a happy congregation, all
   united, all earnest, all pleading with God and there were grand
   Sabbaths, then! You can never forget those days of the Son of Man upon
   the earth, when conversions were numerous and all the people of God
   rejoiced and were ready to shout for joy. If you have any recollection
   of such days as those, pray this prayer, "Lord, what You have done, You
   can do! Will You not revive us again? You can outdo all we have yet
   seen of Your work. Come, now, we beseech You, and repeat Your mercies
   in the eyes of Your people."

   After some mercy drops, then, it becomes us to cry for showers of
   blessing. Pray again the petition that we sang just now--

   "Revive Your work, OLord, And give refreshing showers, The glory shall
   be all Your own, The blessing, Lord, be ours."

   Another time for such a prayer is after tokens of Divine displeasure,
   when we are somewhat under a cloud. Thus the Psalmist says, "Will You
   be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all
   generations? Will You not revive us again that Your people may rejoice
   in You?" I feel that the Church of God is generally, at this time, in a
   very sad state and though I am told that I am a croaker, and too
   nervous, and so on, yet I know what I know, and I speak not without
   clear information nor without a heart that is heavy at knowing so much
   of the evil of the times! And, because the times are dark and God's
   Gospel is at a discount, and prayerfulness of spirit and holiness of
   life are things not so common among us as they should be, therefore I
   think that it is time to cry to the Lord, "Will You not revive us
   again?" I entreat God's people to pray, now, if they have ever prayed
   in their lives! This is a dark hour of the night--now cry mightily unto
   the Lord, the God of our salvation--that He will turn our captivity and
   send the daystar which shall herald that day that shall never know a
   night! It is good to pray when you have seen good days and it is
   equally right to pray when you think that the days are not what they
   should be.

   Another time for praying like this is when saints feel lethargic. Do
   you always feel active? Do you always feel energetic? I think not! If
   you were to look at one of the statues, say, in Westminster Abbey, you
   would find that it never complains of rheumatism and is not affected
   either by heat or cold, because it is not alive. But living men and
   living women have their changes because they have life. The most
   flourishing tree that grows sheds its leaves when the time comes. All
   plants are not always in flower--they have their springs, their
   summers, their autumns and their winters--and it is just so with God's
   people. Whenever you, therefore, feel dull and lethargic, here is a
   prayer for you--"Will You not revive us again? Lord, come and wake us
   up again! Pour fresh strength into Your weak children! Put the living
   fire into Your lukewarm children! Raise Your sleepy children,
   Lord--make us all to live at the highest point of life if, for a while,
   we have seemed ready to die." Perhaps someone will say, "Then it is the
   prayer for me, for I feel dull and weak." If so, be sure that you use
   it. Do not acknowledge the suitability of it and then put it up on the
   shelf, but pray to the Lord at once, "Will you not revive us again?"

   Another time when this prayer is very suitable is when efforts seem to
   be useless--when, for instance, I have preached the Gospel and have had
   no conversions. When you have been in your Sunday school class and no
   child has cried to God for mercy. When you have been up and down your
   tract district and not one person has said a cheering word as to taking
   interest in the sermon that you have left. When, indeed, you have come
   to close quarters with some hearts and have really laid yourselves out
   for the conversion of such and such persons--and you appear to have
   failed. Well now, if that has been your experience, do not go home
   miserable, but go to God with this prayer, "Lord, will You not revive
   us again?" How quickly the Lord can revive us! Here, by the space of 33
   years or so, I have been favored by the Grace of God to preach to an
   attentive congregation, but there have been times when I have felt that
   there was--

   "No stir in the air, no stir in the sea," when I have preached, but it
   seemed to be like talking to a dead wall! And yet, before I have been
   aware of it, God's Spirit has come down upon the people and the same
   blessed Gospel--for we have not two gospels--has been blessed to many
   and, one after another, they have cried out, "What must we do to be
   saved?" Workers for Christ, never think of giving up your work, but
   stick to it and pray this prayer vehemently, and intensely, "Will You
   not revive us again? Lord, send us once again times of increased
   spiritual life, times of greater success in the winning of souls!"

   And, once more, I think that this prayer may well be prayed when we
   have among us a number of persons who are backsliding. In a large
   Church there are always some who are spiritually sick--going back and
   declining--and some of us know the heartbreak of mourning over those
   that once ran well, of whom we have sorrowfully to ask, "What hindered
   them?" There are some who used to be bold in the service of God who now
   forsakes His House of Prayer, His way and even deny His holy name!
   Well, what then?--

   "When any turn from Zion's way, Alas, what numbers do!"

   Then let this prayer be in our heart and on our tongue, "Will You not
   revive us again? Great Shepherd, come and bring back the stray sheep.
   Holy Spirit, come, we beseech You, with Your quickening breath, and
   bring back to life and spiritual health those that are fainting and
   ready to die."

   Thus I think I have shown you that there are many occasions upon which
   this prayer would be a very fit one. Let us now silently, all of us who
   know how to pray, breathe this petition into God's ear, "Will You not
   revive us again that Your people may rejoice in You?"

   II. Secondly, though it will be the same thought presented a little
   differently, let us consider THE NEED OF SUCH A PRAYER--"Will You not
   revive us again?" Who needs such a prayer?

   Who needs it? Well, first of all, the minister needs it. Brothers and
   Sisters, you make a mistake about some of us ministers--you have a
   notion that we are always full of Grace, that when we come into the
   pulpit we are always able to command earnestness and zeal. Do not
   believe it! We are but poor creatures without our God. Apart from
   Divine Grace, we are just as hard-hearted towards sinners as any of our
   people are, and we have to cry mightily to God to keep our spiritual
   nature alive, even as you do. I entreat you, pray more for us! Pray
   that God would revive us again! If the preachers grow dull and sleepy,
   there is no wonder that the people do! Therefore give us a special
   place in your supplications that we may be kept right for your sakes,
   for Christ's sake and the Gospel's sake. Oh, pray for ministers! I am
   not going to find fault with any of them any more than I find fault
   with myself, but there is grievous need to pray for many occupants of
   pulpits, that the Lord would revive them again!

   There is a very common habit of criticizing us and I am sure I do not
   mind if you criticize me as much as you like, but it is very difficult
   for me to find anybody to take this pulpit because anybody that some of
   you like, others do not like. I have given up any idea of pleasing you
   all--but I just try to do my best, that is all I can do. But the habit
   of criticizing ministers is a bad one. Give it up and begin to pray for
   them. Pray more and more for all preachers of the Word, "Lord, revive
   them. Lord, revive them." I have heard of a minister who preached once
   about our being epistles, written not with ink, but with the Holy
   Spirit. One of his divisions was that sometimes ministers were pens and
   they could not write upon men's hearts because they were not dipped in
   the ink. I think that there is a great deal in that thought. If a
   minister comes forward with a good dip of ink in his pen, then he can
   write upon men's hearts. When the Spirit of God fills us and we are
   revived, then some good writing will be done--but not else.

   But, dear Friends, all the leaders of our Church need receiving. Of our
   Church, I mean. If there are any people who need praying for, it is
   deacons, and I put the elders with them. Never forget to pray for them.
   I have no fault to find with them any more than I have to find with the
   ministers, but they are no better than they should be, and they will
   not be as good as they should be unless the Grace of God shall come
   upon them and bless them! Oh, to have around us a loving band of Church
   officers! It is our great joy and delight to have such men around us,
   but may the Lord make better men of them, equip them all for their
   spiritual work to the very highest degree and fill them all with Divine
   Life!

   I was preaching, once, in a place which happened to be full when I
   preached there, but the congregation was very small at other times. And
   when I went into the vestry, I noticed two gentlemen leaning against
   the mantelpiece in a very comfortable manner, and I asked them if they
   were the deacons of the Church. They said that they were, and I then
   told them that I had looked, for some time, to find out the reason why
   that Church did not prosper, and I had found it out! They were anxious
   to know what it was, but I did not further inform them. I have no doubt
   that, often, dead deacons and dead elders prevent a Church
   prospering--therefore, let us pray earnestly for the leaders of God's
   Israel, "Lord, revive them again. Put more spiritual life into them."

   The same is true of all the members of the Church without exception.
   How much they need reviving! And all the workers, too. You who have a
   large class to look after. You who are conducting a Mission. Why, if
   you who lead the way in Christ's work go to sleep, what is to become of
   the work? So, let us carry upon our hearts in prayer all our fellow
   members, the workers and the sufferers, and cry to God, "Lord, revive
   them. Keep them in a good state. Keep them in proper trim that they may
   do that work in noble fashion, and bring glory to Your holy name. Will
   You not revive us again?"

   Brothers, Sisters, let me breathe this prayer in the name of you all,
   "Lord, we want to serve You at our very best. Revive us again, we
   beseech You."

   But, further, we must pray thus, for there is great need on the part of
   the hesitators. Some of you who are here, tonight, seemed about to be
   converted years ago! I know a man whom, to this day, you cannot get
   into a place of worship. He says he will never go any more. He declares
   that he was within an inch of being converted when he went last time
   and he is afraid to go again! But there are some of you who always come
   and you have almost learned to sit contentedly upon the brink of
   decision. Oh, pray for them, dear Friends! Pray for the hesitators,
   pray for the procrastinators, pray for those who are trifling away
   their conscience, gradually getting rid of everything like spiritual
   fear and distress--and who will shut their eyes and sleep themselves
   into Hell unless God, in great mercy, prevents it! O Lord, will You not
   revive us again--that these sleepers may wake up and become decided for
   You?

   Besides, we have need to pray this prayer when we think of the careless
   ones among us. What strange people come into such a congregation as
   this! A man came here this morning for no earthly purpose but to pick
   pockets--and I dare say he is here again tonight! Look sharp after him!
   I wish I knew how to pick my way into his heart and to run away with
   him as a captive for my Lord! Oh, that even he might be transformed by
   Divine Grace! The most curious motives bring people under the sound of
   the Gospel--some of them positively wicked, others of them quite
   ridiculous.

   Then look at the outside public, the myriads who never go to hear the
   Gospel at all. How are they to be reached by a cold, dead Church? So,
   for their sakes, for the sake of this great London, for the sake of
   this great nation, for the sake of the world, let us pray, "O God, be
   pleased to revive us again!"

   I pause here and beseech you not to let me pass the next milestone
   until each one of you have prayed this prayer, "Will You not revive us
   again?"

   III. Now, thirdly, and very briefly, THE ESSENCE OF SUCH A
   PRAYER--"Will You not revive us again?" What is this prayer if it is
   analyzed and we get to the very soul of it?

   Well, it means, first, dependence upon God. If you are praying this
   prayer aright, you feel, "Lord, nobody can revive us but Yourself."
   People often talk about "getting up a revival." Is not that a wicked
   thing? "Will You not revive us, O Lord?" The machinery for getting up a
   revival may often be the greatest hindrance to true godliness! A Church
   cannot be revived unless God revives it! Not a soul is saved, not a
   saint is quickened and made to grow except by the work of God. That is
   what this prayer means, "Lord, put Your hand to the work. Put Your
   right hand to it, we beseech You. We depend alone upon You. Will You
   not revive us again?"

   The essence of this prayer is, next, confidence in God. "Lord, You can
   revive us again. We are not so deep in the mire but that You can lift
   us out. We are not so dead but that You can make us alive. Will You not
   revive us again? It is impossible to us, but it is possible to You.
   Lord, one touch of Your hand, a breath from Your blessed lips, and it
   is done. Will You not revive us again?" Brothers, Sisters, we believe
   in God, do we not? And if we do, we believe that whatever state a
   Church is in, God can bring it out of it! Do not run away from it and
   say, "God can never bless it." He can bless it! Pray it up into a
   blessing and make this the essence of your prayer, "Lord, You can
   revive us. We believe it, and we look for it."

   The essence of this prayer is, next, importunity with God. "Will You
   not revive us again?" It is earnest pleading, it is pushing the point
   home, it is urging it with God. Do this, I pray you, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, with regard to the state of the Church at the present time. If
   half a dozen of you would, tonight, or as soon as possible, shut
   yourselves up a while and begin to cry to God for a revival of
   religion--and if you continued to cry more and more until it
   came--there would be grand hopes for the end of this century. If we
   could get a band of men and women who would give God no rest until He
   made His Jerusalem a praise in the earth, we should see, between now
   and the 20th century, something that would make our very eyes sparkle,
   and our hearts dance for joy! It needs but that we wrestle with the
   Angel of the Covenant and we may have what we will. We may be in a bad
   case, but we are not worse off than the churches were a hundred years
   ago, yet God heard the prayers of mourners in Zion who in secret places
   cried to Him--and He will hear our prayers, too! Therefore, let us make
   a solemn league and covenant together, and let us in union and concert
   of prayer wait upon the Lord and hear what He shall speak, for He will
   yet speak peace unto His people if we do but know how to ask for it. I
   leave with you who are the King's remembrancers this sweet prayer to be
   prayed night and day--"Will You not revive us again that Your people
   may rejoice in You?"

   IV. Now I finish with this last head--THE NET RESULT IF THIS PRAYER IS
   ANSWERED. "Will You not revive us again that Your people may rejoice in
   You?"

   It seems rather singular--does it not--that the Psalmist should put as
   the reason for a revival that God's people should rejoice in Him? You
   and I do not always estimate things aright. Preaching is only the
   stalk--conversion, prayer, praise--these are the full corn in the
   golden ear! In the garden the leaves may represent the work that is
   done, but the flowers are the praise that is rendered. In a revival,
   part of the result is the conversion of men, but the result is the
   praise of God--and that revival brings forth most fruit that gives to
   God the most Glory! God is most glorified when His people rejoice in
   Him and, therefore, the ripest fruit, the innermost core and center of
   that which comes of all holy service, is the joy in God which is as
   worship to Him. I reckon that we have served God when we have fed the
   poor, when we have taught the ignorant, when we have reclaimed the
   wanderer, but I am equally sure that we have rendered acceptable
   sacrifice when we have prayed to God, when we have delighted ourselves
   in Him, when the joy of our heart has, in silence, exhaled towards Him!

   So, therefore, if God will be pleased to send a revival, His people
   will rejoice in Him because they are revived. They will be thankful
   that their spirits are plucked away from their languor and lethargy and
   then they will begin to rejoice with the joy of gratitude because God
   has done such great things for them! And then sinners will be converted
   and straightway saints will rejoice over sinners saved. They will say--

   "Ring the bells of Heaven! There is joy today, For a soul returning
   from the wild" and they will give God the Glory of that soul's
   salvation. So, in that way, His people will rejoice in Him.

   But, best of all, to come back to where I started, when everything is
   right in the Church and there is a happy and prosperous time, then
   God's people will silently and inwardly render unto Him a revenue of
   praise by rejoicing in Him. It must be a good thing--must it not--for
   you in the midst of the turmoil of business, or for me in the midst of
   controversy, just to forget it all, to shake it all off and say, "Oh,
   what a God I have! Blessed be His name"? I often revel in God my
   exceeding joy--I seem to just give myself up to the enjoyment of a holy
   festival of delight in God, feasting my heart to the fullest. And what
   are the dainties that are spread before us at such a feast?

   Well, first, I rejoice that there is a God. What a horrible world this
   would be to live in without God--the house all furnished and nobody at
   home! But my Lord is always at home and God is better than His world,
   beautiful as are the avenues of trees and yonder glistening river! God
   is always at home--that is the joy of our life. I love to see my
   Father's flag on the top of the castle and to feel that He is at home.
   His Presence makes everything so bright.

   And then what a joy it is to think that He is my God! Whatever I have,
   or have not, it does not matter, I have a God, and all that there is in
   God is mine! O my Soul, what a happy, happy being you are! Blessed be
   God forever for making me, seeing that He has made Himself to be mine!
   We praise Him, first, for our being, and then for our well-being--and
   the essence of our well-being is that God, the greatest of all Beings,
   is ours forever and ever! This God is our God forever and ever! He will
   be our Guide even unto death and each one of us who is truly His can
   sing--

   "Yes, my own God is He."

   As I think of God, I meditate on all His attributes. He is a powerful
   God. Oh, how I love Him for that! I do not want to have a weak arm to
   lean upon--let my Lord be the mighty God! Hallelujah to Him because He
   can do all things and all that power will be used for righteousness and
   truth! I love to think of Him as the God of Love, nothing, even in His
   Justice, being contrary to love. Oh, what a blessed God I have--a God
   of Love! Then I think of Him as a God of Justice, and I am equally
   pleased with Him. I do not want an unjust God--a God who could pardon
   sin without Atonement is no God for me! I delight to feel that His
   justice is as much concerned and bound to save me as His mercy. Oh,
   what a joy to be able to rejoice in His Justice! And then to rejoice in
   His Truth--His faithfulness, that He cannot lie--His immutability, that
   He cannot change--His eternal existence, that He cannot faint or
   die--ah, my Brothers and Sisters, I shall not attempt to go over all
   the qualities of the Infinite Jehovah but whatever they are, we delight
   in them all, and yet we rejoice in Him most of all!

   There are many causes for joy to a Christian, but the great wellhead is
   God Himself. I can rejoice in His people, but then they have their
   faults. I can rejoice in His Word, but then I sometimes tremble at that
   Word. I can rejoice in God's works, but then there is a certain terror
   even about them. But as for God, He Himself is perfect! And whether He
   is dressed in robes of war, or comes to me with words of peace, now
   that I am reconciled to Him by the death of His Son, He is altogether
   delightful under any aspect and in any place!

   It may seem a very little thing for us thus to delight in God, but it
   is the greatest thing of all! It is the crown of a revival that God's
   people should rejoice in Him.

   Now, dear Hearts, as you come to the Communion Table, I want you to try
   to rejoice in God. "But I am mourning about myself," says one. Well,
   mourn about yourself if you like, but rejoice in God. "Oh, but I am
   troubled in my circumstances!" Well, but a child of God should rise
   above circumstances and rejoice in God. There is more in God to cheer
   you than in your circumstances to depress you! Say to all these things,
   "Good-bye! Good-bye! Go home, for tonight I am just going to rejoice in
   God to the fullest!" God help you to do so and if you do, I shall know
   that the revival has come, and we shall look to see other fruits of it,
   seeing that this best and sweetest fruit of all is already reached!

   Let us, before I dismiss those of you who will be going away, pray this
   prayer together--

   "Lord, revive us again. Lord, revive me. We would, each one of us, say,
   'Amen' to that petition. Lord, revive the pastor. Lord, revive the
   Church officers. Lord, revive the workers. Lord, revive the members of
   the Church. Lord, revive the backsliders. Lord, revive those who seem
   to live, but have grown careless. Lord, revive the Church at large
   throughout the whole earth. Spirit of revival, come upon us, now, for
   Jesus Christ's sake! Amen."

   And may the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
   the fellowship of the Spirit, be with us evermore! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH43:22-28; 44:1-8; PSALM85.

   We will read two passages of Scripture this evening, both of which will
   have a bearing upon the subject we are afterwards to consider from our
   text. Let us first read a few verses from Isaiah's prophecy, beginning
   at chapter 43:22. [The publishers chose to put the exposition after the
   sermon, but Brother Spurgeon always did the exposition first.--eo]

   Isaiah 43:22. But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob; but you have
   been weary of Me, O Israel. This was a sad charge for God to bring
   against His chosen people. They had grown weary of their God and yet,
   truly, this charge may well be brought against some of us, for we have
   grown weary of God, we have forgotten Him in our daily walk and
   con-versation--and have grown cold in our love towards Him.

   23. You have not brought Me the small cattle of your burnt offerings;
   neither have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you
   to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense. No, God's ways
   are not ways of irksomeness, but ways of pleasantness! Our religion is
   no tax upon us. We find Christ's yoke to be very easy and His burden to
   be very light. All wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness and all her
   paths are peace. "I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor
   wearied you with incense."

   24. You have bought Me no sweet cane with money, neither have you
   filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices but you have made Me to serve
   with your sins. You have wearied Me with your iniquities. "While your
   services have been neglected, your sins have been pampered." What an
   accusation! As God says by the Prophet Amos, "I am pressed under you,
   as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves." God seems to be
   oppressed with the sin of His people, but what comes next? Why, one of
   the very sweetest verses in the whole of the Scriptures!

   25. I, even I, am He that blots out your transgressions for My own
   sake, and will not remember your sins. O glorious mercy! We are sunk in
   the depth of sin and yet God pardons us on the spot! He at once puts
   every sin away and bids us go in peace.

   26-28. Put Me in remembrance: let us plead together, declare you, that
   you may be justified. Your first father has sinned, and your teachers
   have transgressed against Me. Therefore I have profaned the princes of
   the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to
   reproaches.

   Isaiah 44:1. Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant; and Israel, whom I have
   chosen. After all these charges, you see, the love of God to His chosen
   people is still the same! Well might Paul say, "I am persuaded that
   neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
   nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
   other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God,
   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Sin is an exceedingly evil and
   bitter thing, but even that shall not divide us from the love of God,
   for, "while we were yet sinners, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly." So herein Grace triumphs over sin and lays our follies
   beneath its feet!

   2-8. Thus says the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb
   which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, My servant; and you, Jeshurun,
   whom I have chosen. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and
   floods upon the dry ground: I will pour My spirit upon your seed, and
   My blessing is on your offspring: and they shall spring up as among the
   grass, as willows by the water courses. One shall say, I am the LORD'S;
   and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall
   subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name
   of Israel. Thus says the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
   LORD of hosts, I am the First, and I am the Last; and beside Me there
   is no God. And who, as I shall call, and shall declare it, and set it
   in order for Me, since I appointed the ancient people? And the things
   that are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them. Fear you not,
   neither be afraid: have not I told you from that time, and have
   declared it? You are even My witnesses. Is there a God beside Me? Yes,
   there is no God; I know not any.

   Now turn to Psalm 85. This Psalm is dedicated to the chief musician. It
   is a Psalm worthy of the ablest musician. It is to be sung with care.
   They are well instructed who can understand it, and enter into the
   experience it describes. It is called--

   "A Psalm for the sons of Korah."

   I have often reminded you, dear Friends, that when Korah, Dathan and
   Abiram went down alive into the pit, the sons of Dathan and Abiram
   perished with their fathers, but we read, "Notwithstanding, the
   children of Korah died not." We cannot tell why. We must set it down to
   the Sovereign Grace of God. And if it were so, then I can see why they
   became singers in the sanctuary!

   "A Psalm for the sons of Korah." You will sing best who wonder most at
   your salvation! You who can see no reason for it, except the Sovereign
   goodness of God, will have sweet voices tuned with gratitude wherewith
   to praise God. The first verse of the Psalm contains a happy memory

   Verses 1, 2. LORD, You have been favorable unto Your land: You have
   brought back the captivity of Jacob. You have forgiven the iniquity of
   Your people, You have covered all their sin. Selah. Let us think of
   what God has done for His people. He has been very favorable to us in
   years past. He has lifted up the light of His Countenance upon His
   chosen ones and made them glad. "You have brought back the captivity of
   Jacob." We were once in captivity, exiles far off from God and home,
   but He has led our captivity captive, and we are now in bondage no
   longer, blessed be His name! Note again what the Psalmist says--"You
   have forgiven the iniquity of Your people." What a joy that is!
   Forgiven sin is enough to make us sing to all eternity. If sin is
   pardoned, you have a mass of mercy in that fact too great for you to
   estimate its value. "You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people."
   See how the Inspired writer puts it again--"You have covered all their
   sin--hidden it, put it out of sight with that Divine covering of the
   Atonement which has hid forever, even from the eyes of God, the sin of
   His people! There is a happy memory for us--to see what God has done
   for us. Let us bless His name for it. Now comes another happy memory

   3. You have taken away all Your wrath: You have turned Yourself from
   the fierceness of Your anger. "You did stay Your bow even after it was
   bent. Even when Your right arm was bared for war, You did make peace
   for us. 'You have turned yourself from the fierceness of Your anger.'
   When it burned like fire, yet did You stay it through the great
   Atonement of Jesus, "Christ our Lord." Now comes in a prayer

   4. Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause Your anger toward us to
   cease. "You have done all this for Your people; now do this for us who
   fear lest we are not Your people--comfort us! Turn us and then take
   Your anger from our conscience, and let us be at peace with You." How I
   wish that many in this Tabernacle would pray even now, "Turn us, O God
   of our salvation, and cause Your anger toward us to cease!" It is the
   prayer of a Church that is under a cloud. It is the prayer of a nation
   that is suffering for its sin. It is the prayer of a sinner who sees
   what God has done for His people and who entreats the Lord to do the
   same for him.

   5. Will You be angry with us forever? "Surely we have not got into
   eternity yet. Lord, do not have eternal anger toward us. 'Will You be
   angry with us forever?' Will You not hear our prayers? Will You not
   have mercy upon us?"

   5. Will You draw out Your anger to all generations? "Shall our children
   also suffer? Will You not have pity upon them?"

   6, 7. Will You not revive us again that Your people may rejoice in You?
   Show us Your mercy, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation. "We are such
   poor blind creatures that we cannot see! Yet, O Lord, show us Your
   mercy, make us see it, reveal it to us and grant us Your salvation! It
   must be a free grant, a grant of Grace, a grant of Love, therefore,
   grant us Your salvation." Listen to this eighth verse

   8. I will hear what God the LORD will speak. "I will be silent. I have
   spoken to Him, now I will hear what His answer is. I will hold my ears
   attentive to listen to His voice." O my dear Hearers, when you are
   willing to hear God, there are good times coming for you!

   8. For He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints. There is
   peace, peace, nothing else but peace for them!

   8. But let them not turn again to folly. For if they do, the Lord will
   speak to them by rods and chastisements. They that get God's peace must
   mind that they keep it. They must walk carefully, or else they will
   break the peace and they may, themselves, get broken in pieces. "Let
   them not turn again to folly."

   9. Surely His salvation is near them that fear Him. When you honor Him,
   reverence Him, worship Him--His salvation cannot be far away from you.

   9. 10. That glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met
   together. At the Cross is their meeting place! There, you shall see
   God's mercy and God's truth embracing each other over the great
   Sacrifice of Christ. Mercy and truth seem set at variance in the
   sinner's case till they are reconciled by the blood of Jesus!

   10. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. It seemed
   impossible that God should be righteous and yet be at peace with
   sinners, but Christ has taken both parties by the hand and, at Calvary,
   they kiss each other! God is as righteous as if He were not gracious,
   and as gracious as if He were not just! Yes, His justice and His peace
   are, each of them, all the brighter because of the other!

   11. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look
   down from Heaven. Carpeted with truth and canopied with
   righteousness--what a wonderful scene is before us! Truth is coming out
   of the ground as though it had been a dead thing which begins to live,
   and leaves its tomb! And righteousness is throwing up the windows of
   Heaven and leaning out to look down upon the sons of men! "Truth shall
   spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from Heaven."
   What a wonderful meeting this is of truth and righteousness--truth
   lifting up her hands to Heaven and righteousness putting down its hands
   to earth!

   12. Yes, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall
   yield her increase. It is all well when it is well with us in our
   relation to God. When we are reconciled to Him, then all things are
   reconciled by that fact.

   3. Righteousness shall go before Him; and shall set us in the way of
   His steps. Lord, hear the prayer of this Psalm and answer it to us, for
   Jesus sake! Amen.

"The Ark of His Covenant"

   (No. 2427)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, AUGUST 25, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, DELIVERED ON THURSDAY
   EVENING, AUGUST 18, 1887.

   "And the Temple of God was opened in Hea ven, and there was seen in His
   Temple the ark of His testament [covenant--R.V.] and there were
   lightning, and voices, and thundering, and an earthquake, and great
   hail." Revelation 11:19.

   I shall take the passage quite by itself. I do not fully understand its
   context, whether it relates to that which goes before or to that which
   comes afterwards, and happily, it is not necessary for us to know this,
   for the passage stands complete in itself and is full of valuable
   instruction.

   Dear Friends, even we who believe have as yet failed to see much of the
   Truth of God. We know enough to save us, to comfort us and to help us
   on our way to Heaven, but oh, how much of the glory of Divine Truth has
   never yet been revealed to our eyes! Some of God's children do not
   fully know even the common Truths of God as yet, and those who do not
   know them realize but little of their depth and height. From our text
   it appears that there are certain things of God which as yet we have
   not seen--there is need that they should be opened up to us--"The
   Temple of God was opened in Heaven." When our Lord Jesus died, He split
   the veil of the Temple and so He laid open the Holy of Holies. But such
   is our dimness of sight that we need to have the Temple opened, and we
   need to have the Holy of Holies opened, so that we may see what is not
   really concealed, but what we are not ready to perceive by reason of
   the slowness of our understandings.

   The two words for, "Temple," here, may relate not only to the Temple,
   itself, but also to the Holy of Holies, the innermost shrine. Both of
   these, it seems, need to be opened, or else we shall not see what is in
   them. Blessed be the Holy Spirit that He opens up one Truth after
   another to us! Our Savior's promise to His disciples was, "When He, the
   Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all Truth." If we were
   more teachable. If we were more anxious to be taught and waited upon
   Him more, He would, doubtless, lead us into many a Truth of God which,
   at the present moment, we have not fully enjoyed. It is a happy thing
   for you and for me when at any time we can say, "The Temple of God was
   opened in Heaven so that we saw even that which was in the innermost
   shrine of the holy Temple."

   The saints in Heaven doubtless behold all the Glory of God so far as it
   can be perceived by created beings, but we who are on the right way
   there behold as in a glass darkly, the Glory of the Lord. We know only
   in part, but the part we know is not as great as it might be--we might
   know far more than we do even here. Some suppose that they can know but
   little because, they say, it is written, "Eye has not seen, nor ear
   heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
   has prepared for them that love Him." Yes, but why do you stop there?
   Half a text is often not true-- go on to the end of the passage--"But
   God has revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searches
   all things, yes, the deep things of God." And that which your eyes
   cannot see, and your ears cannot hear, and the heart of man cannot
   imagine, can be revealed to you by the Spirit of the Lord! Oh, that we
   were more conscious of the power of the Spirit and that we waited upon
   Him for yet fuller instruction! Then I am persuaded that in our measure
   and degree, it would be true to us, even as to the perfected ones
   above, "The Temple of God was opened in Heaven," and they saw that
   which was in the holiest place.

   What did they see when the Temple was opened? When the secret place was
   laid bare to them, what did they see? That is to be my subject. "There
   was seen in His Temple the ark of His covenant." If we could look into
   Heaven at this moment, this is what we would see, "the ark of His
   covenant." O Sinner, you think that you would see an angry God, but you
   would see the ark of His covenant! O child of God, perhaps you dream of
   many things that might distress you in the glory of that sight, but
   rest content, this would be the main sight that you would see--Jesus,
   the Incarnate God, the great Covenant Surety! You would see there,
   where the Godhead shines resplendent, the ark of His covenant!

   I. I shall begin by noticing, first, that the ark of His covenant is
   always near to God--"There was seen in His Temple the ark of His
   covenant."

   Of course, the outward symbol is gone--we are not now speaking of a
   Temple made with hands, that is to say, of this building. We speak of
   the spiritual Temple above. We speak of the spiritual Holy of Holies.
   If we could look in there, we would see the ark of the covenant and we
   would see the covenant, itself, always near to God. The covenant is
   always there. God never forgets it--it is always before Him--"There was
   seen in His Temple the ark of His covenant."

   Why is this? Is it not because the covenant is always standing? The
   Lord said concerning His people of old, "I will make with them an
   Everlasting Covenant," of which David said, "Yet has He made with me an
   Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure." If God has made
   a covenant with you, it is not simply for today and tomorrow, nor
   merely for this life, but for the ages of ages, even forever and ever!
   If He has struck hands with you through the great Surety, and He has
   pledged Himself to you, remember, "If we believe not, yet He abides
   faithful: He cannot deny Himself." Jehovah has said, "The mountains
   shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness shall not
   depart from you, neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed."
   What He has said He will stand to forever. He will keep His Word. He
   said to His Son, "I will preserve You, and give You for a covenant of
   the people." And He will never revoke the gift. This covenant stands
   secure! Though earth's old columns bow, and though my spirits sink, and
   flesh and heart fail me, yet this covenant shall bear me up even to the
   end.

   The Covenant of Grace is forever the same, because, first, the God who
   made it changes not. There can be no change in God. The supposition is
   inconsistent with a belief in His Deity. Hear what He says--"I am the
   Lord, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed." The
   sun has his changes, but the Father of Lights is without variableness,
   or shadow of turning. "God is not a man, that He should lie; neither
   the son of man, that He should repent: has He said, and shall He not do
   it? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it good?" God has never to
   alter His purposes--why should He? Those purposes are always infinitely
   wise. He knows the end from the beginning, so His Covenant, which He
   made with such deliberation in the councils of eternity, that Covenant
   which is sealed with the most precious things He ever had, even with
   the blood of His only-begotten Son, that Covenant upon which He stakes
   His eternal honor, for His Glory and honor are wrapped up with the
   Covenant of Grace--that Covenant cannot be changed because God,
   Himself, changes not.

   Then, next, the Christ who is its Surety and Substance changes not.
   Christ, the great Sacrifice by whose death the Covenant was ratified.
   Christ, the Surety, who has sworn to carry out our part of the
   Covenant. Christ, who is the very Sum and Substance of the Covenant,
   never alters. "All the promises of God in Him are yes, and in Him,
   Amen, unto the glory of God by us." If we had a variable Savior,
   Brothers and Sisters, we would have a changeable covenant! Look at
   Adam--he could change and, therefore, he was a poor representative of
   the human race. Our first federal head soon fell because he was a mere
   man! But the Surety of the New Covenant is the Son of God, who, like
   His Father, fails not, and changes not! Though He is of the substance
   of His mother, bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh and, therefore,
   can stand as man's Representative, yet is He Light of Light, very God
   of very God, and so He stands fast and firm, like the unchanging God,
   Himself! In this great Truth of God we do and we will rejoice! The
   Covenant is always before God, for Christ is always there. He, the Lamb
   in the midst of the Throne of God, makes the Covenant to always be
   close to the heart of God!

   And, Beloved, note this. The Covenant must always be near to God
   because the love which suggested it changes not. The Lord loves His
   people with a love which has no beginning, no end, no boundary, no
   change. He says, "I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore
   with loving kindness have I drawn you." When the love of God's heart
   goes forth toward the Believer, it is not changeable like the love of
   man--sometimes high and sometimes low, sometimes strong and sometimes
   weak. But, as it is said of our Savior, "having loved His own which
   were in the world, He loved them unto the end," so can it be said of
   the great Father, that His love is always the same! And if the love
   which dictated the Covenant is always in the heart of God, depend upon
   it that the Covenant which comes of that love is always there in the
   secret place of the Most High!

   Reflect also, beloved Brothers and Sisters, that the promises contained
   in the Covenant change not. I quoted to you, just now, one passage
   about the promises, and that is enough--"All the promises of God in Him
   are yes, and in Him, Amen." Not one single promise of God shall ever
   fall to the ground unfulfilled! His Word, in the form of promises, as
   well as in the form of the Gospel, shall not return unto Him void! O
   Souls, you may hang your whole weight upon any promise of God! You need
   not fear that it will break. Though all the vessels of the King's house
   were hung on one nail made by Him, that nail would bear them all up, as
   well as the flagons as the vessels of smaller measure. Heaven and earth
   may hang upon a single promise of God! The Voice that rolls the stars
   along and keeps them all in their orbits is that Voice which spoke even
   the least of the promises and, therefore, every promise of God stands
   secure forever!

   And once more, not only the promises, but the force and binding power
   of the Covenant change not. All God's acts are done with a reference to
   His Covenant and all His Covenant has a reference to His covenanted
   ones. Remember what Moses said of old, "When the Most High divided to
   the nations their inheritance, when He separated the sons of Adam, He
   set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of
   Israel." Everything that He does follows the line and rule of His
   Covenant. If He chastens and afflicts, it is not in anger, but in His
   dear Covenant love. When first that Covenant came into full action with
   the redeemed, it was all powerful--and it is still just as powerful.
   All that God does is still guided and directed by His eternal purpose
   and His Covenant pledges to His people. Stand still, then, and when you
   look up, if you cannot see that Temple because your eyes of faith are
   dim--if you scarcely dare to look within the secret place which is the
   holiest of all--yet know for sure that the Covenant is still there, and
   always there, whether you see it or see it not!

   I will tell you when, perhaps, you will best know that the Covenant is
   there--when the storm clouds gather the most thickly. When you see the
   black masses come rolling up, then remember that the Lord said to Noah,
   "I do set My bow in the clouds and it shall be for a token of a
   Covenant between Me and the earth." Then shall you know that Jehovah
   remembers His Covenant! You may even be half glad of a black cloud,
   that the sun of the Divine Love may paint upon it the many-colored
   rainbow, that God may look on it and remember His Covenant! It is good
   for you to look on it, but what must it be for Him to look on it and to
   remember His Covenant? Be glad that the Covenant is always near to God,
   as our text declares, "And the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and
   there was seen in His Temple the ark of His covenant."

   II. Now, secondly, the Covenant is seen of saints--"There was seen in
   His Temple the ark of His covenant."

   First, we see it when, by faith, we believe in Jesus as our Covenant
   Head. By faith we know that God has entered into covenant with us. He
   that believes in Christ Jesus is in covenant with God. "He that
   believes on the Son has everlasting life." "He that believes on Him is
   not condemned." He that believes in Him is at peace with God--he has
   passed from death unto life, and shall never come into condemnation.
   You are in covenant with God, Believer! Wipe your weeping eyes, ask God
   to take the dust out of them that you may see that there is an
   unchanging Covenant made with you tonight and forever!

   Next, we see this Covenant when, by faith, we perceive it in God's
   actions toward us. Faith may see the Covenant of God in all His
   actions. Do you not remember how the old Scotch woman blessed God for
   her porridge, but she blessed Him most of all because the porridge was
   in the Covenant? God had promised bread and water and, therefore, it
   was sure to come to her! God sent her bread to her in the form of
   porridge and she blessed the Lord that it was in the Covenant. Now, I
   thank God that food is in the Covenant, and that raiment is in the
   Covenant. It is written, "Your shoes shall be iron and brass," so they
   are in the Covenant. Life is in the Covenant and death is in the
   Covenant--"To die is gain." Everything that is to happen to us is in
   the Covenant! And when faith sees it so, it makes life a happy one. Am
   I chastened? I say to myself, "Well, the rod was in the Covenant, for
   the Lord said that if His children disobeyed Him, He would chasten them
   with the rod of men. If I never had the rod, I would be afraid I was
   not in the Covenant." Is it not written, "In the world you shall have
   tribulation?" That is a part of the Covenant, you see, so that when you
   get it, say to yourself, "The God who is evidently keeping this part of
   His Covenant will keep the rest of it for me, His child."

   Brothers and Sisters, we get, perhaps, the best sight of the Covenant
   when, by prayer we plead it. In that hour of our wrestling, in the time
   of our inward craving of mercies from the hand of God, we come, at
   last, to this, "Lord, You have promised. Do as You have said." I love
   to put my finger on a promise and then to plead it with the Lord,
   saying, "This is Your Word, my Father, and I know that You will not run
   back from it. O God, I believe in the Inspiration of this Book and I
   take every word of it as coming from Your lips. Will You not seal it to
   my conscience, my heart, my experience, by proving it to be true?" Have
   you ever found the Lord's promises fail you? I remember one who had put
   in the margin of her Bible in several places, "T and P"--and when she
   was asked what those letters meant, she said, "They mean, 'Tried and
   Proved.' As I go through life, I keep trying and proving the promises
   of God and then I put a mark in the margin of my Bible next to each one
   I have tested, that I may not forget it the next time I have to plead
   it." That is the way to see the Covenant at the right hand of God, when
   you plead it in prayer!

   And there are some of us, I think, who can say that our experience up
   till now proves that God does not forget His Covenant. We have
   wandered, but we have been able to say, "He restores my soul," for He
   has restored us! We have needed many things and we have gone to Him in
   prayer and pleaded that word, "No good thing will He withhold from them
   that walk uprightly," and He has listened to the cries of His servants!
   He said He would do so--"Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will
   deliver you, and you shall glorify Me." He has remembered us in our low
   estate, for His mercy endures forever and some of us who are no longer
   young can set to our seal that God is true because of many experiences
   of His faithfulness! If they tell us that there is nothing in the
   Bible, and nothing in God, and nothing in the Gospel of Christ, we
   laugh them to scorn! We have now, for many a year, lived upon the
   faithfulness of God, and we cannot be driven into a distrust of Him. He
   is faithful and His mercy endures forever!

   Do you not also think that, when we arrive in Heaven, we shall have a
   wonderful retrospect, and that retrospect will all come to this--"The
   Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was seen in His Temple
   the ark of His covenant"? Miss Hannah Moore very prettily puts it that
   we do not often see the right side of things here. She went into a
   carpet factory and she looked at what the workmen were doing--and she
   could see nothing that looked like beauty of design. There were tags
   and ends hanging out and she said to the men, "I cannot perceive any
   design here," and they answered, "No, Madam, for you are on the wrong
   side of the carpet." When she went round to the other side, she saw the
   beauty of the workmanship! Alas, we are at present on the wrong side of
   God's work--we must get to Heaven to see it perfectly! And when we get
   there, we shall--

   "Sing, with wonder and surprise, His loving kindness in the skies, and
   we shall say, "It was all right. It could not have been better."--

   "Every dark and bending line Meets in the center of His love." God has
   not erred. He has not gone abut the longest way to do His work, but He
   has done it in the wisest and most prudent manner, all that was for the
   best and highest interests of His dear covenanted ones!

   Thus I have shown you that sometimes, and it should be always, God's
   people see that glorious Covenant of Grace which is in the Temple
   above.

   III. Now I want to have your attention while I say briefly, in the
   third place, that the Covenant contains much that is worth seeing.

   Let us think of what was in the ancient Ark of the Covenant, for all
   that was in that ark as a type is to be seen in Christ, our heavenly
   Covenant Ark above.

   In that ark, if you and I could have gone into the Holy Place, and have
   had our eyes strengthened to look, we would have seen, first, God
   dwelling among men. What a wonderful thing! Over the top of the lid of
   that sacred coffer which was called the ark, there shone an amazing
   light which was the index of the Presence of God. He was in the midst
   of the camp of Israel. He that fills Heaven and earth, the infinite
   Jehovah, deigned to make that place His special dwelling place, so that
   He is addressed as, "You that dwells between the cherubim." Here is a
   part of the New Covenant--"I will dwell in them and walk in them." It
   is marvelous that God speaks with men. He whom you heard thundering,
   last night, as He drove His chariot through the sky--that God in
   infinite condescension speaks with us--He has come down to us and taken
   us into relationship with Himself in the Person of the Lord Jesus
   Christ, who is at once the Fellow of the Almighty, and the Brother of
   the sons of men! O Beloved, rejoice in the Covenant, that God is no
   longer divided from men! The chasm made by sin is filled! The gulf is
   bridged and God now dwells with men and manifests Himself to them! "The
   secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him."

   Next, in that ark you would have noticed, if you could have seen into
   it, God reconciled and communing with men upon the Mercy Seat. Over the
   top of that ark, as I have told you, was a golden lid, which fitted it
   and covered it exactly. That golden lid was called the Mercy Seat, the
   Throne of Grace. There God spoke with men. He sat there, as it were,
   enthroned as the Friend of men. Now, it is a part of the Covenant that
   God hears prayer, that God answers our petitions, that He meets us in a
   way of reconciled love, that He speaks to us in tones which the spirit
   can hear though the ear cannot. Thank God for a blood-sprinkled Mercy
   Seat! What would we do if we had not that as our meeting place with the
   thrice-holy Jehovah?

   Then, within the ark, underneath the lid, if we could have looked in,
   we would have seen the Law, the two tablets of stone which represent
   Law fulfilled in Christ and forever laid up in His heart, and laid up
   in our hearts, too, if we delight in the Law of God after the inward
   man! Now, this is our joy, that the Law of God has nothing against the
   Believer. It is fulfilled in Christ and we see it laid up in Christ,
   not to be a stone to fall upon us to grind us to powder, but beautiful
   and fair to look upon as it is in the heart of Christ and fulfilled in
   the life of Christ. I rejoice in the Covenant which contains in it
   stipulations all fulfilled and commands all executed by our great
   Representative!

   Together with those tablets of the Law there was laid up a rod, a rod
   which had originally been a dry stick in the hands of Aaron, but when
   it was laid up before the Lord, it budded, and blossomed, and brought
   forth almonds! So, in the Covenant of Grace, we see the Kingdom
   established and flourishing in Christ, and we rejoice in it. Oh how
   pleased we are to bow before His fruitful scepter! What wonderful fruit
   we gather from that blessed rod! Reign, reign, Jesus, reign! The more
   You rule us, the more You are absolute Sovereign of our hearts, the
   happier shall we be, and the more shall we delight ourselves in You!
   There is no liberty like complete subjection beneath the sway of Jesus
   who is our Prophet, Priest and King!

   Then, by the side of that rod there was laid up the golden pot full of
   manna, the provision made for the wilderness. Let us rejoice that there
   is in the Covenant all the provision that we need. God has laid up for
   us in Christ all our spiritual meat, all the food that we shall ever
   need between here and Heaven. "Feed me till I need no more," we cry to
   our blessed Covenant Representative--and He will do so!

   Then, over the top of the ark, sat the cherubim with outstretched
   wings, as, I think, representing how the angels are in league with us,
   and with the angels all the forces and powers of the universe. This day
   the beasts of the field are our friends and the stones of the field
   have ceased to be our foes. Child of God, you may travel by land or
   sea. You may go where you will, for everywhere you are in your Father's
   house! All that you see about you is a friend to you, since you are a
   friend to God. I often wonder that the earth bears up ungodly men. It
   must groan beneath the weight of a swearer! It must wish to open and
   swallow him up. But with the gracious man, the man who fears God, all
   things are at peace, and we may know it to be so. "You shall go out
   with joy, and be led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills
   shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the
   field shall clap their hands."

   We do not often enough realize, I think, the friendship of all God's
   creatures to those who are His children. St. Francis, though he was a
   Romish monk, yet had a true idea when he used to regard the sparrows
   and other birds of the air, and even the dogs in the street, as his
   friends and his brothers, and talked to them as such. And Luther was
   much of the same mind when he opened his window and listened to the
   chirpings of the robins in the early spring, and felt that they had
   come to teach the theological doctor some lesson which he had not
   learned. Oh yes, oh yes, we are quite at home anywhere, now that God is
   our God! True, the earth travails, and is in pain, and the creation
   suffers and will suffer till Christ comes again, but still, her travail
   is our travail, and we are in sympathy with her, and when she reflects
   the Glory of her God she is our mirror in which we see our Father's
   face.

   Thus, I think, I have shown you that there is much to be seen in the
   Ark of the Covenant. God give us Grace, like the angels, to fix our
   eyes upon it! "Which things the angels desire to look into." We have
   more to do with the Ark of His Covenant than they have--let us be more
   desirous, than they are, to look therein!

   IV. I close with this fourth point. The Covenant has solemn
   surroundings. Listen--"There were lightning, and voices, and thunder,
   and an earthquake, and great hail."

   When the people entered into covenant with God on Sinai, the Lord came
   down upon the top of the mountain and there were thunder, and
   lightning, and voices, and an earthquake. There were all these tokens
   of His Presence and God will not leave the Covenant of His Grace
   without the sanctions of His power--that thunder, that lightning, that
   storm--all these are engaged to keep His Covenant! When they are
   needed, the God who smote Egypt with great hailstones, the God who make
   the Kishon to sweep His enemies away, the God who made the stars in
   Heaven to fight against Sisera will bring all the overwhelming forces
   that are at His command to the help of His people and the fulfilling of
   the Covenant which He has made with them!

   O you who are His people, fall back in confidence upon the God who has
   treasures of snow, and hail, and the dread artillery of storm and
   tempest! Most of you, my Hearers, have never seen a great storm, nor
   heard in its majesty the thunder of God's power. You must be in the
   tropics to know what these can be--and even then you would have to
   say-- "These are but parts of His ways." Oh, how the Lord can shake the
   earth and make it tremble, even, to its deep foundations when He
   pleases! He can make what we call, "the solid earth," to be as weak as
   water when He does but lift up His finger! But all the power that God
   has--and it is boundless--is all in that right hand which has been
   lifted high to Heaven in the solemn oath that He will save His people!
   Therefore, lean upon God without the shadow of a doubt! He may well put
   all your fears to rest even by the thunder of His power!

   Then reflect that there is another side to this Truth of God. You who
   are not in covenant with God, you who have not believed that Jesus is
   the Christ, you who have never fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope
   set before you, you who refuse the Divine mercy which comes to you
   through the bleeding Person of the suffering Christ--remember that
   there will be for you the thunder, the lightning, the voices, the
   earthquake and the great hail, for these set forth the terrors of
   eternal Law overthrowing God's adversaries! You have no conception of
   what God will do with the ungodly! False teachers may smooth it down as
   much as they like, but this Book is full of thunderbolts to you who
   refuse God's mercy! Listen to this one text--"Consider this, you that
   forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver."
   Can you sport with that?

   Listen to another--"Ah, I will ease Me of My adversaries, and avenge Me
   of My enemies!" What will you say to that, or to this? "And again they
   said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up forever and ever." "The same
   shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without
   mixture into the cup of His indignation; and he shall be tormented with
   fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the
   Presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever
   and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast
   and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name." They talk as
   if we invented these terrible words, but we did not--we merely quote
   the Scriptures of the Truths of God and they are terrible, indeed, to
   the wicked! They should make men start in their sleep and never rest
   until they find a Savior!

   A Universalist once said to a Christian man that whatever he did, God
   would not punish him. And the other replied, "If I spit on your god, I
   suppose he will not punish me. If I curse him, if I defy him, it will
   all come right at last?" "Yes," said the Universalist. "Well," answered
   the other, "that may be the character ofyour God, but don't you try
   that kind of thing with my God, the God of the Scriptures, or else you
   will find that because He is Love, He cannot and He will not suffer
   this world to be in anarchy, but He will rule it, and govern it, and He
   will punish those that refuse His infinite compassion."

   So I beseech you, my Hearers, fly to Jesus at once! Weary, and
   heavy-laden, look to Him, for He says especially to you, "Come unto Me,
   and I will give you rest." The Lord add His blessing to His Truths I
   have tried to preach to you, the sweet and the terrible alike, for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Hebrews 9

   Verse 1. Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of Divine
   service and a worldly sanctuary. That is to say, a material sanctuary,
   a sanctuary made out of such things as this world contains. Under the
   Old Covenant, there were certain outward symbols. Under the New
   Covenant, we have not the symbols, but we have the substance itself.
   The old Law dealt with types and shadows, but the Gospel deals with the
   spiritual realities themselves.

   2, 3. For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
   candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the
   sanctuary. And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called
   the Holiest of All. All this was by Divine appointment--the form of the
   rooms, the style of the furniture--everything was ordained of God and
   that not merely for ornament, but for purposes of instruction. As we
   shall see farther on, the Holy Spirit intended a significance, a
   teaching, a meaning, about everything in the old tabernacle, whether it
   was a candlestick, or a table, or the showbread.

   4, 5. Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid
   round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and
   Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; and over it
   the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now
   speak particularly. It would not have been to the point which the
   Apostle had in hand, so he waived the explanation of those things for
   another time.

   6-8. Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always
   into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. But into
   the second went the high priest, alone, once every year, not without
   blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
   the Holy Spirit this signifying. It is from this sentence that I am
   sure that the Holy Spirit had a signification, a meaning, a teaching,
   for every item of the ancient tabernacle and Temple, and we are not
   spinning fancies out of idle brains when we interpret these types, and
   learn from them important Gospel lessons. "The Holy Spirit this
   signifying"--

   8. That the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest,
   while as the first tabernacle was yet standing. It was necessary that
   you should take away the sacred tent, the tabernacle, yes, and take
   away the Temple, too, before you could learn the spiritual meaning of
   them. You must break the shell to get at the kernel. So God had
   ordained. Hence, there is now no tabernacle, no Temple, no holy court,
   no inner shrine, the Holy of holies. The material worship is done away
   with in order that we may render the spiritual worship of which the
   material was but the type.

   9. Which was a figure for the time then present. Only a figure, and
   only meant for "the time then present." It was the childhood of the
   Lord's people. It was a time when, as yet, the Light of God had not
   fully broken in upon spiritual eyes, so they must be taught by picture
   books. They must have a kind of Kindergarten for the little children,
   that they might learn the elements of the faith by the symbols, types
   and representations of a material worship. When we come into the true
   Gospel Light, all that is done away with--it was only "a figure for the
   time then present."

   9. In which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make
   him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience. All
   these rites could only give a fleshly purity, but they could not touch
   the conscience. If men saw what was meant by the outward type, then the
   conscience was appeased, but by the outward sign, itself, the
   conscience was never comforted if it was a living and lowly conscience.

   10. Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and
   carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. These
   ordinances were only laid upon the Jews--not upon any other people and
   only laid upon them until the better and brighter days of reformation
   and fuller illumination.

   11. But Christ--Oh, how we seem to rise when we begin to get near to
   Him, away from the high priests of the Jews! "But Christ"--

   12. Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, He
   entered in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption
   for us. The Jewish high priests went once a year into the Holy of
   Holies. Each year, as it came round, demanded that they should go
   again. Their work was never done! But, "He entered in once," and only
   once, "into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
   I love that expression, "eternal redemption"--a redemption which really
   does redeem and redeems forever and ever! If you are redeemed by it,
   you cannot be lost. If this redemption is yours, it is not for a time,
   or for a season, but it is, "eternal redemption." Oh, how you ought to
   rejoice in the one entrance within the veil by our Great High Priest
   who has obtained eternal redemption for us!

   13-15. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
   heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the
   flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the Eternal
   Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
   dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause He is the
   Mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the
   redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament,
   they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
   When you come to deal with Christ, you have to do with eternal things.
   There is nothing temporary about Him, or about His work. It is "eternal
   redemption" that He has obtained for us! It is an "eternal inheritance"
   that He has purchased for us!

   16,17. For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
   death of the testator. For a testament is offorce after men are dead:
   otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives. Or,
   "Where a covenant is, there must also be the death of him who
   covenants, or of that by which the covenant is established." Or read it
   as we have it in our version, for it seems as if it must be so,
   although we are loathe to give the meaning of "testament" to the word,
   since its natural meaning is evidently covenant--"Where a testament is,
   there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a
   testament is of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of no
   strength at all while the testator lives." Or, if you will, while the
   victim that was to confirm the covenant lived, the covenant was not
   ratified--it must be slain before it could be thus effective.

   18-22. Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
   blood. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
   according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with
   water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and
   all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament which God
   has enjoined unto you. Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the
   tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. And almost all things
   are by the Law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no
   remission. There is no truth more plain than this in the whole of the
   Old Testament! And it must have within it a very weighty lesson to our
   souls. There are some who cannot endure the doctrine of a
   substitutionary Atonement. Let them beware lest they be casting away
   the very soul and essence of the Gospel! It is evident that the
   Sacrifice of Christ was intended to give ease to the conscience, for we
   read that the blood of bulls and of goats could not do that. I fail to
   see how any doctrine of atonement except the Doctrine of the Vicarious
   Sacrifice of Christ can give ease to the guilty conscience! Christ in
   my place suffering the penalty of my sin--that pacifies my conscience,
   but nothing else does! "Without shedding of blood is no remission."

   23. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
   heavens should be purified with these. These things down below are only
   the patterns, the models, the symbols of the heavenly things! They
   could, therefore, be ceremonially purified with the blood which is the
   symbol of the atoning Sacrifice of Christ.

   23, 24. But the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than
   these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
   which are the figures of the true; but into Heaven, itself, now to
   appear in the Presence of God for us. He never went within the veil in
   the Jewish Temple--that was but the symbol of the true Holy of Holies.
   He has gone "into Heaven, itself, now to appear in the Presence of God
   for us."

   25-28. Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest
   enters into the holy place every year with blood of others; for then
   must He often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now
   once in the end of the world has He appeared to put away sin by the
   sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but
   after this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
   many. There is no need that He should die again, His one offering has
   forever perfected all His people! There remains nothing but His final
   coming for the judgment of the ungodly and the acquittal of His
   redeemed.

   28. And unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time
   without sin unto salvation. Christ's second coming will be "without
   sin," and without a sin offering, too, wholly apart from sin, unto the
   salvation of all His chosen. May we all be among those who are looking
   for Him! Amen.

The Marriage Supper of the Lamb

   (No. 2428)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 21, 1887.

   "And he said unto me, Write, 'Blessed are they which are called unto
   the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" Revelation 19:9.

   You will perceive that there was an exhortation to John to "Write." Why
   was he especially to write these words down? I conceive that it was,
   first, because the information here recorded was valuable--"Blessed are
   they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb." It was
   worth while that this new beatitude should be recorded, so the angel of
   God said to the Apostle, "Write." It was also to be written because of
   its absolute certainty--"These are the true sayings of God." This
   blessedness was not a thing to be spoken of once and then to be
   forgotten, but it was to be recorded so that future ages might see that
   it is surely so, assuredly so beyond all question! God has bidden this
   record to be written in black and white, yes, engraved as with an iron
   pen and lead in the rock, forever--"Blessed are they which are called
   unto the marriage supper of the Lamb."

   It was to be written, no doubt, to bring it under our consideration as
   a thing worthy of being weighed, a text to be read, marked, learned and
   inwardly digested--not merely spoken to John by the angel of God, but
   written by the Apostle at the express order of the Spirit of God. Lord,
   did You say to John, "Write it," and shall I not read it? Did you bid
   the beloved disciple write it and do You not, thereby, virtually bid me
   consider it and remember it? Lord, by Your Spirit, write this message
   on my heart, "Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage
   supper of the Lamb."

   I find that my text is succeeded, as well as preceded, by something
   remarkable--"He said unto me, These are the true sayings of God." Lest
   any doubt should arise in our minds about the marriage supper of the
   Lamb, or about the fact that many are called to that supper, or about
   the blessedness of such as are called, the angel says, "These are the
   true sayings of God." Some things appear to be too good to be true. We
   frequently meet with sinners, under a sense of guilt, who are staggered
   by the greatness of God's mercy. The Light of the Gospel has been too
   bright for them! They "could not see for the glory of that Light," as
   Paul said in describing the appearance of Christ to him when on the
   road to Damascus. So, "to make assurance doubly sure," that we may not
   question its truth because of its greatness, we have this solemn
   declaration especially certified by order of the Lord, under the hand
   and seal of the Spirit of God--"These are the true sayings of God." O
   Sirs, the Lord Christ will come again! He will come to gather together
   His people and to make them forever blessed! And happy will you be if
   you are among that chosen company! If you shall meet the King of Kings
   with joyful confidence, you shall be blessed, indeed!

   You noticed that I read parts of two chapters before I came to my text
   and I did it for this purpose. The false harlot-church is to be judged
   and then the true Church of Christ is to be acknowledged and honored
   with what is called a marriage supper. The false must be put away
   before the true can shine out in all its luster! Oh, that Christ would
   soon appear to drive falsehood from off the face of the earth! At
   present it seems to gather strength, and to spread till it darkens the
   sky and turns the sun into darkness, and the moon into blood. Oh, that
   the Lord would arise and sweep away the deadly errors which now pollute
   the very air! We long for the time when the powers of darkness shall be
   baffled and the pure Everlasting Light shall triumph over all! We do
   not know when it shall be--

   "But, come what may to stand in the way, That day the world shall see,"

   when the Truth of God shall vanquish error and when the true Church
   shall be revealed in all her purity and beauty as the Bride of
   Christ--and the apostate church shall be put away once and for all and
   forever!

   Time rolls wearily along just now, apparently, and some hearts grow
   heavy and sad, but let us take courage. The morning comes as well as
   the night and there are good days, not so far off as we have sometimes
   fancied--and some of us may yet live to see times which shall make us
   cry, "Lord, now let Your servants depart in peace, for our eyes have
   seen Your salvation." Whether we live till Christ comes again, or
   whether we fall asleep in Him, many of us know that we shall sit down
   at the great wedding feast in the end of the days and we shall partake
   of the supper of the Lamb in the day of His joy and Glory! We are
   looking across the blackness and darkness of the centuries into that
   promised millennial age wherein we shall rejoice with our Lord with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory!

   I. I will no longer delay you from the text. And in meditating upon
   this august marriage festival, I want you to notice, first of all, THE
   DESCRIPTION OF THE BRIDEGROOM.

   There is no marriage without a bridegroom. There is no marriage of the
   Church without the appearance of Christ and, therefore, He must be
   manifested. He must come out of the ivory palaces wherein He hides
   Himself, today, and He must appear in His Glory! And when He shall
   appear, what shall be His title? Notice it-- "Blessed are they which
   are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb."

   This term-- "the Lamb"--seems to be the special name of Christ which
   John was accustomed to use. I suppose he heard it, first, from that
   other John called the Baptist, when he said, "Behold the Lamb of God,
   which takes away the sin of the world." Isaiah had compared the Christ
   to a lamb brought to the slaughter, but he had not really called Him
   "the Lamb of God." This beloved John, who knew the Master better than
   anyone else, seemed to love constantly to call Him by this most
   expressive name.

   Now, if in any Book of the Bible we might have expected that our Lord
   would not have been called the Lamb, it would have been the Book of the
   Revelation. It might seem as if the name, "the Lion of the tribe of
   Judah" might appropriately have been used every time, and the name of,
   "the Lamb," have been dropped. The name, "the Lamb," seemed suitable
   for Jesus here below, despised and rejected of men, led to the
   slaughter, dumb and patient beneath the hands of cruel men. The name,
   "the Lamb," seemed suitable for Gethsemane, Gabbatha and Golgotha--but
   John calls the Savior by this name many times all through this Book of
   the Revelation! He writes constantly about the Lamb, the Lamb in the
   midst of the Throne, the Lamb leading His people to living fountains of
   water. And now the angel tells him to write about the marriage supper
   of the Lamb!

   This is the more remarkable because, at first sight, it may seem
   incongruous to blend these two things together--the Lamb and a marriage
   supper. But the incongruity of figures must sometimes be allowed in
   order to make more apparent some master Truth of God which must not and
   cannot be veiled for the sake of correct rhetoric! It sometimes happens
   that language becomes a burden to thought--great thoughts will break
   the backs of words and crush them into the dust. So it happens that
   comparisons and metaphors crack and break, like rotten wood in the
   wind, under the stress of some great master thought which rules the
   writer's mind. It matters not whether it is congruous in figure, it is
   suitable enough in fact that the wedding at the last should be the
   marriage of the Lamb!

   What do I infer from this? I gather, in a word, just this, that Christ
   anywhere, even in His highest Glory, still wishes us to regard Him as
   the Sacrifice for sin. He desires to be viewed by us in His Character
   as the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world. This is a
   Character which He never lays aside and it is as the Lamb that He will
   manifest Himself in the consummation of all things when His Church is
   perfected!

   First, as the Lamb, He is the one everlasting Sacrifice for sin. Where
   is the lamb that God has provided for a burnt offering? It is Jesus!
   Where is the morning and evening lamb to take away Israel's guilt? It
   is Jesus! Where is the lamb that bleeds and dies, that with its blood
   the lintel and the two side posts may be smeared to secure the inmates
   of the house from the destroying angel in Egypt? It is Jesus! All His
   life, and in His death, He was no lion, no beast of prey--He was the
   gentle, suffering, sacrificial Victim, dying that we may not die,
   presenting Himself a Sacrifice acceptable unto God!

   Now, because Christ was the Lamb, suffering for sin, and because He
   delights to remember that He was our Sacrifice, therefore He is seen in
   that capacity in the day of the gladness of His heart. He links the
   memory of His grief with the manifestation of His Glory--and as He was
   a Lamb to redeem His Church, so does He appear as a Lamb in the
   marriage supper of His Glory! One reason why He does this is because He
   is especially glorious in the Character of the Lamb of God. I cannot
   conceive of our Lord Jesus Christ as ever being less than infinitely
   glorious, but, dear Friends, if there is ever a time when we can
   appreciate the splendor of His Character more fully than at other
   times, it is when He is on the Cross--when He dies, "the Just for the
   unjust, that He might bring us to God."

   Tell me not of all the Glory which surrounds Him now in the midst of
   the Throne--I cannot conceive any Glory exceeding in brightness the
   Glory of His self-denial, the Glory of His taking upon Himself the form
   of a Servant and, being found in fashion as a Man, becoming obedient
   unto death, even the death of the Cross. The glory of men consists in
   what they are prepared to suffer for others. The glory of a king must
   lie, not in the crowns he wears, but in what he does for his
   subjects--and Christ's Glory is most seen in His sacrifice for sinners!
   "Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
   his friends." But Christ laid down His life for His enemies. When the
   Lord Jesus Christ put on the bloody shirt in Gethsemane. When He
   bedecked Himself with the five bright rubies of His wounds. When He was
   adorned with the crown of thorns and, last of all, when He was
   decorated with that robe of blood as the soldier pierced His side, then
   it was that He was more illustrious than at any time before or since in
   the eyes of those who think aright! This is the star in His sky, no,
   the sun that eclipses all the stars--that Jesus loved, pitied and had
   compassion even to the death upon the sons of men! So, in the day of
   His marriage, He comes out, again, in this highest and noblest of
   Characters-- especially glorious as a Lamb! It is as a Lamb that He
   celebrates the marriage supper with His Bride, the Church.

   Brothers and Sisters, I think that it is very appropriate for Christ to
   appear in Glory as a Lamb, because it is as the Lamb that He has most
   fully displayed His love to His Church, to which He is espoused, and to
   which He is to be married at that Last Great Day. Beloved, the marriage
   supper is a feast of love--there, love is at home. So Jesus, that He
   may reveal Himself in His love best of all, appears as a bleeding
   Sacrifice on the day of His love's triumph. I do not know how to talk
   about this great theme, but this Truth of God rests in my heart and
   makes me feel more glad than I can tell. It lies like a cake of sweet
   perfume upon the altar of my soul and burns there with the soft bright
   flame of love. And I rejoice to know that in the day when Jesus takes
   His Church by the hand and leads her Home to His Father's house, He
   will appear in that Character in which He most of all has shown His
   love to His beloved. You see most of His love when you see most of His
   griefs and most of His condescension--and, therefore, in that Character
   does He appear at His marriage supper.

   There is one other thought before I leave this first point. It is as
   the Lamb that Christ is best loved of our souls. At any rate, you feel
   your affections most drawn out toward Him who suffered in your place.
   Tell me, you who know Him most, you who love Him best, is it not so?
   You have seen Him on His Throne, but you have fallen at His feet as
   dead, for the sight has been too much for you! But when you have seen
   Him on the Cross, oh, then your heart has melted while your Beloved has
   spoken to you and you have said, "He has won my heart. Now He has
   completely mastered me--I must love Him now." So then, you see, on the
   day of His marriage, when He would be best loved, Christ comes unto His
   Church robed in that garment in which He appears most lovely in her
   sight, and He draws out at that marriage supper, more fully than ever
   He did, all the love of all His redeemed for whom He laid down His
   life!

   Now, you who care not for my Lord as a Substitute and a Sacrifice, will
   you be at the marriage supper when He appears as the Lamb? It is as the
   Lamb of God that you reject Him! You are willing to take Him, you say,
   as a Teacher, or as an Exemplar, but as the Sacrifice for sin you will
   not have Him. Then, neither will He have you! In that great day, as you
   have disowned the vicarious Sacrifice, He who was that Sacrifice will
   disown you! There will be no marriage between your soul and Christ if
   you will not have Him as the Lamb, for that marriage feast is to be the
   marriage of the Lamb, and of none else. As long as this tongue can move
   and these lips can speak, I will preach nothing to you but Jesus Christ
   and Him Crucified--that He, who knew no sin was made sin for us that we
   might be made the righteousness of God in Him! I know no Savior but
   that Christ, "who His own self bore our sins in His own body on the
   tree," and who, "when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at
   the right hand of the Majesty on high," and now in Glory bears the
   marks of the great Propitiation by which His people are saved!

   II. But now, secondly, I have to speak a little upon THE MEANING OF THE
   MARRIAGE SUPPER--"Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage
   supper of the Lamb." What will that marriage supper be? There will come
   a time when all God's redeemed shall be saved.

   There will come a day when all who have died shall have been raised,
   again, from the tomb, and those who remain alive shall have been
   changed, so that their corruption shall have put on incorruption, and
   mortality shall have put on immortality. Then will the Church be
   perfect and complete. No one member will be missing. There will be no
   spot or wrinkle remaining in her. Then it shall come to pass that
   Christ will celebrate this marriage supper, which will be the bringing
   of the people of God into the closest and happiest union with Christ
   their Lord in Glory.

   Even now the Lord Jesus Christ is no stranger to some of us, and we are
   not strangers to Him. Yet there shall come a day when we shall see Him
   face to face and then we shall know Him with a clearer and fuller
   knowledge than is possible for us today. What that bliss will be, I
   cannot tell. Oh, the ineffable brightness when we shall see the face of
   Jesus! Oh, the unspeakable sweetness when we shall hear His voice! Oh,
   the amazing bliss when He shall manifest Himself to us in all His
   Glory! And there will come such a day for all whom He has redeemed, for
   all who trust Him and rest in His atoning Sacrifice. That will be the
   marriage supper of the Lamb!

   That feast will be, like most other marriage suppers, the fulfillment
   of long expectation. Our Lord has waited long for His perfected Church.
   He espoused Himself to her before ever the earth was, but there was
   much to be done before she was prepared for the marriage. The
   Bridegroom, too, had to leave His Father and become one with His Bride
   by taking upon Himself our humanity. For our sake He quit the thrones
   and royalties of Heaven that He might be bone of our bone, and flesh of
   our flesh--and here He was born, and here He lived, and here He died!
   But still, the Bride was not ready--and it is not till you come to this
   chapter that you read, "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife
   has made herself ready." Souls have to be saved--new-created,
   blood-washed, sanctified, perfected--and the whole of them must be
   gathered to make up the body of Christ's Spouse. And when that is done,
   and she is all complete, the expectations of the Christ will be
   fulfilled at that marriage supper. O Beloved, you do not know the
   longings of the heart of Christ for that day of glory! For this He
   lived! For this He died! For this He continually pleads that all for
   whom He shed His precious blood might be His in that day! That day is
   fast coming and when it arrives, then will be the wedding feast above.

   Then will be, also, the day of the open publication of the great fact
   of mutual love and union. At this moment Christ loves His Church and He
   is one with her, but the world, as a whole, does not know it. It does
   not know either Him or her, nor does it care about them. But the day
   shall come when Christ will bring His hidden people into the light of
   day! "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of
   their Father." And then shall the Christ, Himself, also be manifested,
   though long hidden! Oh, what a day that will be when the eyes of the
   entire universe shall be turned in one direction and the glorious
   Christ, in the splendor of His Manhood and of His Godhead, shall take
   the hand of His redeemed Church and, before men and angels and devils,
   declare Himself to be one with her forever and forever! That will be
   the beginning of the marriage supper of the Lamb--it will be the
   publication to all of the great fact of mutual love and union!

   Moreover, the picture of a marriage supper is intended to set forth the
   overflowing of mutual delight and joy. There is too much joy for two!
   They are so happy that they invite others to come in and share the
   banquet. So, in those days, how delighted this blessed Christ and His
   Church will be with one another! How the Church will rejoice in Him!
   How He will rejoice in the Church! What hallelujahs will they raise to
   Him and oh, with what delight will He look upon all His people and see
   in them neither spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing--because His
   blood has cleansed them and His Spirit has perfectly sanctified them!
   Of old it was written, "The Lord your God in the midst of you is
   mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over you with joy; He will rest
   in His love, He will joy over you with singing." But what will that
   rest of love be and that singing of the Christ over His blood-bought
   ones when they are all before Him, and all made like unto Himself to
   reflect the Glory of God!

   Brethren, to add just one other thought, that marriage feast will be
   the grandest display of Christ's magnificent generosity in a banquet.
   If people ever make a little more show than on other occasions, it is
   usually at a marriage feast. And oh, what a show Christ will make that
   day! Depend upon it, there will be no little show when He shall come in
   the Glory of His Father, with all the holy angels with Him, and with
   the very clouds of Heaven to be the dust of His feet! Then shall His
   Church come before Him in all the glory He has given to her. Her
   raiment shall be of worked gold. There is no luster, no beauty, no
   excellence that can be compared with that which Christ will put upon
   His Church! She will admire Him and He will admire her. She will bless
   Him and He will bless her. Oh, I talk but feebly about lofty things
   that need a poet's eye and a poet's tongue! No, put away your
   poetry--the most sober language that can be uttered might better fit a
   theme in which the highest sublimities must be simplicities! I want you
   all to believe that there is to be a day when all the chosen seed,
   blood-bought and saved, will make one body--and Christ shall come and
   glorify them with Himself in a union that shall never know an end,
   though the ages roll along forever and for ever!

   III. Now, thirdly, I must speak a little about THE PERSONS WHO ARE
   CALLED TO THIS SUPPER. Who are the people who are called to this great
   marriage feast?

   In one sense, you are all called to it. O my Hearers, there is a call
   of the Gospel to each of you! We are bid to preach it to every creature
   under Heaven and we do preach it, leaving none of you out. "Whoever
   will, let him take the Water of Life freely." "Whoever shall call on
   the name of the Lord shall be saved." The call, "Behold, the Bridegroom
   comes," is to the foolish virgins as well as to the wise, and if you do
   not come, it is not because you were never invited and never entreated
   to come to Christ! By the Spirit of the living God, I implore you men
   and women to seek the Savior's face! I may never address you all again,
   as perhaps I have never addressed some of you before, but by Him that
   comes in the clouds of Heaven I entreat you to fly to Jesus, the great
   and only Savior! Seek His Grace, now, that you may see His face with
   joy in the great day of His appearing!

   But this is not exactly what the text means, for, although there is a
   blessedness in being called, it curdles into a curse if, being called,
   sinners refuse to come to the Savior. Who, then, are they who are
   specially called to this marriage feast? Well, first, they are those
   who are so called as to accept the invitation. Have you come to Jesus?
   Are you trusting Him? Will you have Him? Does your heart say, "Yes"?
   Then, He is yours! There was never any unwillingness in Christ to
   receive the guilty. The unwillingness is in you--and if the
   unwillingness has gone from you, since it never was in Him, take Him
   and have Him forever! Take Him and have Him tonight! When Abraham's
   servant wanted to take Rebekah to Isaac, her mother and brother said to
   her, "Will you go with this man?" So would I say to any young man or
   woman I may be addressing, "Will you go with Christ? Will you have
   Christ?" If so, He will have you! If you are willing to have Him, you
   are among those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!

   To help you to judge yourself, here is another test. Those who are
   called to that marriage supper love the Bridegroom. He will have no
   enemies at His banquet! Do you love Jesus? Does your heart leap at the
   sound of His name? Timid trembling woman, do you love Him? You cannot
   speak for Him, but you could die for Him? Ah, well, if your heart goes
   after Him, His heart has long ago gone after you and you shall be at
   the marriage supper! I tell you more--you shall be a part and parcel of
   His Bride in the day of His appearing!

   Again, those who are called to this supper are made ready. Are you made
   ready? You remember that the man who came to the wedding feast was bid
   to put on a wedding garment--have you put on the righteousness of
   Christ? Has Christ put on you His sanctification? Are you changed in
   heart? Without holiness no man shall see the Lord! Has the Grace of God
   renewed you? Then you are one of those who shall come to the
   wedding--among the blessed who are called to that great marriage feast!

   You may help to judge yourself by answering one more question. Have you
   any desire to go to that marriage feast? Do you look for Christ's
   coming? There are some who are altogether unconcerned about it--they do
   not care about Christ or His coming--it is all nothing to them, an airy
   nothing! O my Hearer, I trust that you are not of that opinion! But if
   you are looking for and hastening unto the coming of the Son of God. If
   your faith is resting on His first coming and your hope is in His
   second coming--if you see your sin put away by His coming as a
   Sin-Offering--and then your sorrow put away by His coming as your
   Bridegroom, then, dear Heart, be sure that you would not have these
   drawings towards Him unless He had drawn you to Himself! He is drawing
   you--therefore, run after Him!

   IV. Now, lastly, let us think of THE BLESSEDNESS WHICH IS ASCRIBED TO
   THOSE WHO ARE CALLED TO

   THIS MARRIAGE SUPPER.

   I know that I am speaking to many who are called to the marriage supper
   of the Lamb and I want you, my dear Hearers, to enjoy yourselves, for
   you have a prospect which blesses you even now. If you are called to
   the marriage supper of the Lamb, the text says that you are blessed and
   truly blessed you are! "Blessed are they which are called unto the
   marriage supper of the Lamb." If you had an invitation to see the
   Queen, tomorrow, some of you who are wonderfully loyal would think a
   great deal of it, and you would be saying to yourselves, "Well, we are
   going home tonight to a very narrow room in a very poor cottage, but we
   have something great in prospect tomorrow! And oh, think of this, you
   who are poor, you who are pained, you who are very weak, you who are
   cast down--within a short time your eyes "shall see the King in His
   beauty and the land that is very far off."

   It may be only a few days, or weeks, or months--certainly only a few
   years at most--and we shall all share the Glory that awaits the Church.
   And the Glory of our dear Lord who loved us, and gave Himself for us,
   will be ours, and ours forever. I know that you put this great event
   far away and say that it is a long way off. But it is not, it is close
   at hand! Suppose it were not to come for a thousand years? Yet what is
   that but the twinkling of an eye, very soon over? The older men get,
   the shorter time seems to be! When I was a child, a week seemed to be a
   very long time. You who have grown old know that a year seems to come
   and go before you are aware of it. You can say with Job, "My days are
   swifter than a runner: they flee away." Yet what matters it if we have
   to wait 50,000 years for our bliss? We who have believed in Christ have
   the absolute certainty that we shall, one day, stand in the midst of
   the splendor of Christ's wedding feast! The nuptials of a king are
   usually something very grand, but what will the marriage supper of the
   King of Kings and Lord of lords be--when He who is the Son of the
   Highest shall take to Himself His fit companion--when it shall no more
   be said of the Man, Christ Jesus, that there was found no help meet for
   Him, but when He shall take His Church, made out of His own flesh and
   shall welcome her unto Himself to go from Him no more forever?

   I shall be a part of that Church and you who believe will be a part of
   that Church--and we shall all have great honor in being called to such
   a future. What bliss to be there! What joy to be there, not as
   spectators, but as part of the Bride that shall then be taken by her
   Husband! My Soul, you shall swim in happiness, you shall dive in seas
   of inconceivable delight by reason of your union with Christ and your
   delight in Him and His delight in you! I know no better idea of Heaven
   than to be eternally content with Christ and Christ to be eternally
   content with me! And all this will happen within a very little time.
   Therefore, lay aside your cares, dismiss your fears, murmur no more.
   Such a destiny awaits you that you may well be content.

   I have heard that when Queen Elizabeth once carried the crown, while
   she was a young princess, she found it heavy as she bore it before her
   sister, but one said to her, "You will like it better when you wear it,
   yourself." So, we have to carry, every day, a weight for Christ, but
   oh, when the crown is put upon our own heads and we are in Paradise
   with Him, we shall forget the light afflictions which were but for a
   moment, as we enter into the enjoyment of the far more exceeding and
   eternal weight of Glory! I want you, if you can, to enjoy yourselves
   while you think of the honor which is to be put upon all Christ's
   people in being married to Him--

   "One with Jesus, By eternal union, one,"

   partakers of His name, His estate, His Glory, Himself! He shall make us
   to sit with Him upon His Throne, even as He has overcome and sits down
   with His Father upon His Throne.

   Remember, too, we shall be blessed at the marriage supper because no
   fear will mingle with our enjoyment. It has been well observed that if
   men and women could know all that will happen to them in the course of
   their married life, they might, perhaps, not think a wedding day such a
   happy day, after all. So soon may love grow cold, so often may promises
   be broken and unkindness take the place of affection, that it is but a
   dubious joy that surrounds the wedding feast. But once with Jesus at
   the banquet above, there will be no such fear! Here, I may have a fear
   lest my love to Him should not be true, lest, after all, my following
   of Him should be but temporary and not the consequence of the new life
   within. But once up there, we shall raise no more questions! We shall
   be exposed to no more dangers, we shall no more dread backsliding and
   apostasy. Once there, we shall be--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin, With God eternally shut in."

   Once there, every pain and tear and fear will have gone forever--that
   will be a glorious wedding feast, indeed!

   My beloved Hearer, will you be there? If there were no Hell, the loss
   of Heaven would be Hell. If there were no To-phet, to have missed
   Christ's wedding feast were a Gehenna, black enough. If there were no
   worm that dies not and no fire that never can be quenched, this were
   damnation deep enough--to have missed the kisses of Christ's mouth and
   the joy of the everlasting oneness in His Glory. Do not miss it! I
   charge you, do not miss it. When some of us shall be flying through the
   gates of the New Jerusalem, I trust that we shall hear you as we pass
   by and, pausing for a moment to ask, "Who is there?" you will answer,
   "I am here, brought to know Christ by your ministry." That shall make
   another Heaven to add to our own Heaven! Everyone that we shall see
   there, converted by the preaching of the Cross by our lips, or through
   the printed sermons, shall multiply our bliss and make us yet
   happier--and forever and ever happier, still, in your happiness and
   joy!

   I have finished my discourse, but I do not like, somehow, to go home
   with this thought in my mind--perhaps some of you will miss this bliss!
   The muster roll will be read, but your name will not be there! Can you
   bear that thought? Remember that if you are not blessed, you are
   cursed! If you find not Heaven, you are lost forever! You have often
   joined with God's people in singing--

   "I love to meet among them now,

   Before Your gracious feet to bo w,

   Though vilest of them all!

   But can I bear the piercing thought--

   What if my name should be left out,

   When You, for them, shall call?" You cannot be left outside the wedding
   feast if you have trusted in Jesus! Then trust Him at once! Rest in
   that Lamb who will be your Bridegroom and at whose marriage supper you
   shall be present to praise the Glory of His Grace forever and ever!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION18:20-24; 19:1-18.

   May the Spirit of God take away the veil from our eyes while we read
   what was revealed to the beloved Apostle John! Here we have the
   prophecy of the destruction of the great anti-Christian system of
   Babylon, which, being interpreted, is and can be none other than the
   apostate Church of Rome!

   Revelation 18:20-24. Rejoice over her, you Heaven, and you holy
   Apostles and Prophets; for God has avenged you on her. And a mighty
   angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea,
   saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown
   down, and shall be found no more at all. And the voice of harpers, and
   musicians, and ofpipers, and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all
   in you; and no craftsman, of whatever craft he is, shall be found any
   more in you; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all
   in you; and the light of a candle shall shine no more shine in you; and
   the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at
   all in you: for your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by
   your sorceries were all nations deceived. And in her was found the
   blood of Prophets, and of saints, and of all who were slain upon the
   earth. Now, after the false church is put away, the true Church of
   Christ shines out in all her glory and purity!

   Revelation 19:1-4. And after these things I heard a great voice of much
   people in Heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and Glory, and honor,
   and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are His
   judgments for He has judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth
   with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of His servants at her
   hand. And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up forever and
   ever. And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
   worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. Heaven
   and earth are equally glad and they unite to adore the living God when
   the great apostasy--that has so long cursed the nations--is hurled into
   the sea!

   5, 6. And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all
   you His servants, and you that fear Him, both small and great. And I
   heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of
   many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for
   the Lord God Omnipotent reigns. And His great power is never better
   seen than in crushing the powers of darkness and putting the hosts of
   evil to the rout.

   7-10. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to Him: for the
   marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready. And
   to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and
   white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he said
   unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage
   supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true sayings of
   God. And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See
   you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren that have
   the testimony of Jesus: worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the
   spirit of prophecy. All worship, therefore, of saints and angels is a
   gross error, not to be tolerated for a moment! John was mistaken in
   falling down to worship the angel and he was speedily rebuked. And his
   mistake was quickly corrected. There is no doctrine that needs more to
   be preached, just now, than this message of the angel, "Worship God."
   Neither crosses, nor crucifixes, nor holy wafers, nor anything that can
   be seen or handled must be worshipped-- "Worship God." We still need to
   hear God's mighty voice proclaiming from Mount Sinai the great Law.
   "You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make unto you
   any engraved image, or any likeness of anything that is in Heaven
   above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under
   the earth: you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for
   I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
   fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
   that hate Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me,
   and keep My Commandments."

   11. And I saw Heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He that sat
   upon Him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He does
   judge and make war. Behold your Savior, the Champion of the cause of
   truth! His war is not that of the carnal weapon and of garments rolled
   in blood. It is a spiritual warfare, but He wins a more glorious
   victory than ever sword or gun could gain.

   12-14. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many
   crowns; and He had a name written, that no man knew, but He Himself.
   And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is
   called The Word of God. And the armies which were in Heaven followed
   Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. All His
   true ones, all His faithful ones, all His saints, whether ministers or
   not--the heavenly armies--"followed Him upon white horses, clothed in
   fine linen, white and clean." Holiness is their armor, light is the
   panoply that they wear as they go forward to this holy war.

   15. And out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, He puts down vice and evil
   of every kind, not with the sword of steel, but with His Word--"Out of
   His mouth goes a sharp sword"--

   15, 16. That with it He should smite the nations: and He shall rule
   them with a rod of iron: and He treads the winepress of the fierceness
   and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His vesture and on His thigh a
   name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. For this Son of God
   whom we worship, this Jesus of Nazareth, is Master of all! All power is
   in His hand. He is, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."

   17, 18. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a
   loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven,
   Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
   that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the
   flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on
   them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and
   great. By this highly figurative language, we are to understand that
   when Christ goes forth to war in battling for the truth, and His true
   followers come after Him, their victory will be certain-- and the slain
   of the Lord will be many! We look not for carnage and bloodshed to
   establish the Kingdom of Christ in the earth, but this Revelation gives
   us a picture of the utter overthrow and destruction of all forms of
   error through the power of the everlasting Gospel of Jesus Christ!
   Amen, so let it be!

   Would God that the King of Kings would mount His white horse at once
   and that all His people would follow Him! He will do so at the right
   time and then the victory shall be unto God, and to the Truth of God,
   and to love, and to peace and holiness forevermore.

Converts, and Their Confession of Faith

   (No. 2429)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 4, 1837.

   "One shall say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself by the
   name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord,
   and surname himself by the name of Israel." Isaiah 44:5.

   THIS is to take place after the Lord has poured out His Spirit upon His
   people, and upon their offspring. The mainspring of everything good and
   gracious is the Holy Spirit. Where He comes, everything prospers. But
   when He has gone, nothing but failure and disaster will come. I believe
   that at this present moment God's people ought to cry to Him day and
   night that there may be a fresh baptism into the Holy Spirit. There are
   many things that are desirable for the Church of Christ, but one thing
   is absolutely necessary, and this is the one thing--the power of the
   Holy Spirit in the midst of His people. You know the very simple
   imagery which sets forth this blessing. If you go down to some of our
   Thames bridges, you will find the barges stuck fast in the mud and you
   cannot stir them. It would be a very difficult thing to provide
   machinery with which to move them--all the king's horses and all the
   king's men could not do it! But wait till the tide comes in! Now every
   black, heavy old barge "walks the waters like a thing of life!"
   Everything that can float is movable as soon as the silver flood has
   returned. So, many of our churches lie in the mud. Everything seems
   motionless, pow-erless--but when the Spirit of God comes in like a
   flood, all is altered! Therefore, let us pray--

   "Come, Holy Spirit, come."

   I know that, in one sense, He is always with us, but I am sure that, in
   another sense, He is not. He is abiding in this dispensation, but He is
   not with this Church or with that--and all the churches have need to
   cry, "Come, heavenly flood! Come with Your mighty force and lift us all
   out of our spiritual death!"

   When the Spirit of God comes, converts come, too. If they do not come
   by the Spirit of God, they are not worth having. I have heard, and
   sorrowfully heard, of many instances where revivalists have added to
   churches by the score and by the hundreds, but after a couple of years
   none of the professed converts have been left. If men are brought to
   say, "I am the Lord's," merely as the result of excitement, they will
   generally be saying what is not true. And though they may think it
   true, yet time, which tries all things, will prove their profession to
   have been untrue. We must have the Spirit of God with us for real
   spiritual work and if we have Him not, the most powerful revivalist
   will be only as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal!

   We must have the Spirit of God with us. If we have His Presence, even
   the ordinary minister's preaching will suffice for great blessing to
   the hearers. But without that Spirit, the ordinary preaching will
   become more dull and flat and lifeless than ever--and there will be no
   increase in the Church, and no earnestness among those already in it. I
   beseech you, therefore, pray day and night for the Spirit of God! We
   want to have sound doctrine, we want to have great diligence and zeal,
   we want to have superior holiness--I will not go on with the catalog of
   what we want--but let us have the Holy Spirit and we shall have all
   these! This will bring back to the Church and to the individual
   Believer all that is necessary for spiritual health and strength.

   Now, supposing that we have had our prayers answered and that the
   Spirit of God has been poured out like floods upon the dry ground, then
   see what is to happen--converts will come forward to confess their
   faith! So the text evidently tells us.

   In considering it, I would have you notice, first, that this confession
   of faith is personal--"One shall say, I am the Lord's," and so on.
   Secondly, it is varied, for, while there are some who say it, there are
   others who subscribe it with their hand. And, thirdly, while this
   profession is varied, it is also very gracious. There are wells of
   sweet water within this expression, "I am the Lord's." We shall try to
   draw some of the water out that we may drink and be refreshed.

   I. Concerning the converts we so much desire to see and the confession
   which the Spirit of God will lead them to make, let me begin by saying
   that THIS CONFESSION OF FAITH IS PERSONAL--"One shall say, I am the
   Lord's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and
   another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord." You see, it is
   not a joint confession, but an individual one. It is "one," and,
   "another," and, "another."

   Notice, first, that all confession of Christ must be personal--anything
   else is unreal and worthless. All religion that is true is personal--it
   has to do with the man's own heart. He is moved to it by his own
   conscience. His faith must be his own faith. His repentance must be
   repentance of his own sin. His coming to Christ must be his own coming
   to Christ. Nobody can perform your religion for you--it is not possible
   that anything like sponsorship should be admitted into real, vital
   godliness! Here is a man who professes that he promised that you should
   renounce all the pomps and vanities of this present wicked world. Who
   dares promise such a thing as that? If I were to promise for an unborn
   child that it would have red hair and a Roman nose, I would be quite as
   reasonable as if I promised that any child should become a child of

   God!

   I cannot do it, it is not in my power, nor within the power of any man!
   In every act of religion you, yourself, must be concerned--the godliest
   mother can pray for you, but you will not be saved unless you pray for
   yourself! The most believing father may use his faith on your behalf,
   but you will not be saved unless you, yourself, believe! It is useless
   for one man to think that he can either believe or repent for another.
   You are born, one by one--you will die one by one! You will have to
   stand at the Judgment Seat of Christ in your own proper personality!
   You must, each one, humble yourselves before God, confess your sin and
   personally look to Him who was lifted up upon the Cross for our
   redemption--and personally yield yourselves up to God. Baptism of which
   you have no personal knowledge, in which you have no conscious part, is
   the mockery and mimicry of Baptism--but it is not Scriptural
   Baptism--and any profession of faith in which you have no conscious
   part, yourself, is the mimicry of a confession, but it is not a
   Scriptural confession!

   "One shall say, I am the Lord's," but he would not speak for another!
   That other "shall call himself by the name of Jacob." And the two,
   together, cannot speak for number three, for he shall come forward and
   "subscribe with his hand unto the Lord." My dear Friends, I do charge
   you, understand that "you must be born again." You must yield your
   hearts to Jesus! And this must be a matter of personal concern with
   you. National religion and family religion may be well if rightly
   understood, but nothing less than personal religion will bring anyone
   into the Kingdom of Heaven!

   This, then, is required of us by the Lord, that our religion should be
   personal. The Gospel comes to us with its urgent call, "Repent and be
   baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the
   remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
   To each convinced sinner who asks, "What must I do to be saved?" the
   Gospel says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved."
   It invites you, my Friend, as much as if there were not another person
   in the world! And the Word of God, if it comes with power to your soul,
   will come as distinctly to you as if you were the only person in the
   whole universe! It must be so--nothing but distinct personality will do
   in religion--and especially in the confession that we make of our being
   the Lord's people.

   This personal confession, dear Friends, needs to be carefully attended
   to when there are many coming forward. I always dread lest any of you
   should come into the Church in a crowd. I have often known persons
   brought into this Tabernacle by the crowd. They somehow mingled with
   the stream and they did not and they could not move out of it--they
   were caught up off their feet and carried in here! And, sometimes,
   there are seasons with Churches when individuals seem to be carried
   into a confession of faith because it is the fashion to do so--others
   are doing it, so they do the same! I pray you to be very careful about
   this matter! If your father, your mother, your brothers, or your
   sisters make a profession of religion, that is no reason why you should
   do so unless you can truthfully do it! If you have not repented of sin,
   do not say that you have done so! If you have not believed in Jesus, do
   not say that you have! Do not think of coming forward merely because
   your friends are joining the Church. Act for yourselves!

   One of the lessons I have constantly to teach you is that you are
   individually responsible to God and that it is absolutely necessary for
   you to exercise your own personal judgment about matters of faith and
   practice. There may be some who say, "Do what your priest tells you,"
   but we have no priests, because we want all of you to be priests! You
   are to be a nation of priests. If you are God's people, you are to act
   before God for yourselves under the teaching of His Spirit given to you
   individually--and we beseech you to do this. Do not let custom, either
   good or bad, sway you, but as we charge you not to run with a multitude
   to do evil, so we exhort you not to run with the multitude professedly
   doing good when you are not doing it and when your practice does not go
   with your profession! In all times of revival, it is very necessary
   that this Truth of God should be taught.

   But, next, this individual confession of your faith in Christ is
   incumbent upon you especially when there are few coming forward. I
   could say to myself, "If there is nobody in this village confessing
   Christ, then it is all the more urgent upon me that I should confess
   Him. If in the Church few have come to tell the pastor that they have
   found Christ by his means, if I have found the Savior, I will certainly
   go! I will let him see that he has not quite labored in vain. I will go
   for his sake. If there are few added to the Church, then I will go that
   the Church may not be discouraged in its Christian efforts." Oh, I like
   to have around me those who feel, "It is no consideration with me
   whether there are many or few! I have to act as before God on my own
   account. If there are few who do right, that is all the more reason why
   I should do it." One said to me, the other day, "My daughters go to
   such a place of worship because it is fashionable and," he added, "that
   seems to me a curious reason, for I go to another place because it is
   not fashionable."

   I think that it is a grand thing to learn to be in the right with two
   or three. Some people say, "'Why, you are in such a small minority!"
   Yes, yes, but as a general rule, minorities are right. Up till now, the
   majority has never been on the side of Christ, the majority has never
   been for God, the majority has never been with the Truth of God! Oh,
   dear young fellows, I cannot bear that you should always be trying to
   jump the way the cat goes! Go the right way--never mind about the cats!
   Do not be saying, "I must do what the other fellows do," but be bold
   and do exactly what the others do not do when you believe that is the
   right thing to do. What? Is heroism altogether gone? Will Christianity
   breed no more martyrs? I trust in God that it is not so, but that when
   there are few confessing Christ, and faith in Him, some of you men and
   women will feel, "I shall take up my cross and follow Christ and do it
   the more decidedly, and the more openly, and the more quickly because
   there are so few doing it."

   If we do not mind what we are doing, we may go to Hell for the sake of
   company! But I would rather go to Heaven, alone, than go with all the
   multitude down the road to Hell. Still are our Savior's words true,
   "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto life, and
   few there are that find it." Oh, that you may resolve that the way
   shall not be too narrow and the gate shall not be too strait for you
   and that, by God's Grace, you will find it, and love it none the less,
   but all the more because the multitude prefer the broader road!

   II. Secondly, THIS CONFESSION IS VARIED.

   First, one person speaks out for himself--"One shall say, I am the
   Lord's." That is a fine speech! Truthfully made, it is like a clean cut
   piece of marble! "I am the Lord's." If you, from your very soul, can
   say this in any company and not be ashamed to say it before men,
   angels, or devils, God has taught you a noble piece of eloquence! "I am
   the Lord's." There is a great fullness about these words, as I will try
   to show you, directly, but there are some Christians who have made this
   distinct avowal and they stand to it. Perhaps they have not joined a
   Church yet--they should do so, but they have done well to say, "I am
   the Lord's." Paul said of the Macedonian Christians, "This they did,
   not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord and unto
   us by the will of God." You have no right to belong to a Church till
   first you belong to the Lord--so that you can truly say, "I am the
   Lord's." But it is most blessed when a man or a woman feels this, and
   says this, and keeps to it till death--"I am the Lord's." This is a
   noble avowal. I pray God that you may be enabled, now, to make it for
   the first time if you have never made it before.

   The next person mentioned in our text confessed his faith in a
   different way, for he called himself by the name of Jacob. That is to
   say, he took up his position with the people of God under their
   lowliest title. "There," he said, "I am prepared to suffer affliction
   with the people of God, to be reproached when they are reproached, to
   be shunned when they are shunned, to be ridiculed when they are
   ridiculed. I belong to Jacob! He is an extraordinary person, cut off
   from the rest of the world to be the Lord's and I go with him." It is a
   grand thing when, first of all, a man knows he is the Lord's, but in
   some persons, this confession takes more prominently the shape of
   feeling that they will be with the people of God, that they are willing
   to take up their cross and go with God's people wherever they go. Their
   resolution is something like that brave declaration of Ruth to Naomi,
   "Where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your
   people shall be my people and your God my God."

   I remember speaking with a Christian woman who lay dying. She was under
   some form of doubt at the time, but she said, "I feel sure that the
   Lord will never send me among the ungodly, for my tastes and habits do
   not lie that way. I have always been happiest among the people of God
   and, surely, the Lord will let me be gathered to my own company." And
   so He will. There is a story told--I believe a true one--of a poor
   woman who had long been a Believer, but, partly through aberration of
   mind, I think, she grew so despondent that nobody could cheer her.
   Before she died, she came out into bright light, but for a long time
   she was under a cloud and her belief was that she would be sent to
   Hell. She feared such a doom above all things, but she prayed this very
   singular prayer, that, although she must suffer for her sins, she might
   have a place by herself where she might not hear the blasphemies of the
   wicked against God. She seemed as if she was not afraid of any form of
   suffering, but she said that she could not bear to hear God's name
   blasphemed! Dear Soul, there was no fear about her safety, was there?
   Where there is that holy dread of sin, that hatred of evil, that real
   love to God, there is no fear whatever of what will become of such
   people!

   Now, there are some who, at first, are afraid that they do not belong
   to the Lord, but they say that they will belong to His people. They
   wish, somehow or other, to get in among them and especially when they
   see them despised. Then they come forward and stand up for them, and
   say, "On me, also, let the reproach fall, for I, also, am one of them."
   This is a grand spirit. I commend it heartily!

   But here is a third person who makes his confession in a still
   different way--"Another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord,
   and surname himself by the name of Israel." I do not know this person.
   Sometimes I think that he is a friend of mine who is afraid to speak,
   but who likes to write. "I could not," says one, "speak my confession
   of faith, but I could joyfully sit down and write it." Yes, you are
   timid, trembling and slow of speech. Do not condemn yourself for that.
   I have heard of one who came before the Church and could not speak a
   word--and when the pastor asked her some questions and almost put the
   answers into her mouth, she could say nothing. So he was obliged to
   say, "My dear Sister, the Church cannot judge at all as to your faith,
   for you say nothing." And then she broke the silence by exclaiming, "I
   cannot speak for Christ, but I could die for Him." "Oh!" said the
   minister, "that is the best confession of all!" There are some of that
   sort who would not be able to speak in public, being so timid and
   retiring, but they subscribe with their hand unto the Lord.

   Still, I am not sure that this is the person mentioned in the text. I
   seem to fancy that it is a stronger body, a man who is not content with
   saying it, but who writes it down in black and white--"I am the
   Lord's." That which is written remains, so he puts it down. I have
   known such people to write out and sign a declaration that they belong
   to Christ. If they add any promises to that declaration, I am afraid
   that they will bring themselves into bondage. But if this is all, that
   they distinctly declare that the transaction is done, and that they
   belong to God, I think that it is a very admirable way of confessing
   faith in Him. Possibly, I may be addressing some young people who have
   done this. Let them be thankful that they have been enabled to make
   such a declaration of their faith and let them stand to it and abide by
   it all their days!

   But you will notice, also, that this person who thus subscribed, or
   wrote with his hand, unto the Lord, also went the whole way towards God
   and His people at their best, for it is added that he surnamed himself
   by the name of Israel. Let me put this matter very plainly to you. I
   believe that there are some who give themselves up to the Church of God
   in a very complete and unreserved manner, resolving that all the
   privileges they can enjoy they will have, all the holiness they can
   ever attain to they will gain, and all the consecration that lies
   within the region of possibility they will strive after and secure.
   They surname themselves by the name of Israel--they not only join God's
   people at their worst, but they mean to join them at their best. Not
   only do they take the name of Jacob, but the name of Israel, also!

   There are certain persons who have joined this Church--I shall not
   indicate them, but you must know who they are--they are those who, when
   they joined the Church, joined it with all their heart and threw their
   whole soul into it. They give their time, their substance, themselves,
   to the cause of God for the Glory of Christ. On the other hand, there
   are some who join the Church and we have the distinguished privilege of
   having their names in our books, but that is all, for they do nothing
   for Christ. They are a worry to us rather than a help. They are the
   very first persons to find fault if they do not derive benefit. But as
   for the Church's service, they cannot answer to their names when the
   roll is read, for they are not here--they are busy in the world and
   their whole strength is there--they do not surname themselves by the
   name of Israel!

   Happy is the Church when the Lord sends into her midst men and women
   who are so completely the Lord's that they give themselves up heart and
   soul to His service. Years ago, when farming used to pay, I have known
   farmers have a farm which they worked, themselves, and then they had
   another at a distance which they called their off-hand farm, out of
   which they did not get very much. So I believe that there are some
   people whose religion is a sort of off-hand farm--they do not get much
   out of it, nor do much with it--but their worldly business is their
   home farm which they work with all their might. The other matter is of
   secondary importance to them. Such people are not likely to be very
   happy in the Lord, themselves, and they are not likely to be made
   useful to others.

   I think that I have thus shown you that there are varied ways of making
   this confession of faith. With some, it is a distinct avowal of their
   union with the Lord, Himself. With others it is mainly a sense of their
   union with the Church. With others it is a blending of the two and a
   carrying of both to a high degree of perfection. God give us many
   converts of this last sort!

   III. I was going to finish with this observation, that THESE
   CONFESSIONS OF FAITH ARE ALL GRACIOUS,

   but I can only deal with one, for our time has gone--"I am the Lord's."

   I wish that I could convey to others the feelings which I have had in
   thinking over these words. They had been with me many days before I
   ventured to think of preaching from them--"I am the Lord's." You know
   the order in which they come elsewhere. "My Beloved is mine, and I am
   His." "I am His," follows, "my Beloved is mine." You must have Christ
   before you say that you belong to Christ. Beloved, have you taken hold
   on Christ? Have you appropriated Him? Is He your all, your everything?
   Is it so? Well then, you should go on to say, "I am the Lord's."

   This declaration, "I am the Lord's," is a very practical confession,
   for, if I am the Lord's, then I must not give myself up to be the slave
   of another. I must not serve the world, the flesh, or the devil, for,
   "I am the Lord's." If the Lord has bought me, if the Lord has chosen
   me, if the Lord has called me, if the Lord has taken me to be His
   peculiar portion, I must be reserved for Him and not given to another.
   This ought to be a check to me in my whole daily life, if I am tempted
   to do this or that which is wrong.

   It will be also a high incentive to duty to say truly, "I am the
   Lord's." I must live for Him; I cannot merely talk about being His, I
   must prove it to be so in private by my walking with Him and in public
   by my walking like He. If I am the Lord's, I must lay myself out to
   extend His Kingdom and win the souls of others to His sway. I must be
   zealous for my Lord--it must not be one step today and another
   tomorrow, for "I am the Lord's." I must not be idling and trifling, for
   "I am the Lord's." If this Truth shall come with power to your hearts,
   it will tend to make earnest workers of you, such servants as need not
   be ashamed even in the day of their Lord's appearing.

   But while it has a practical bearing, this confession has a sweet
   comforting aspect--"I am the Lord's." The devil desires to have me,
   but, "I am the Lord's," so he cannot have me. Sin would have me, but,
   "I am the Lord's," and He has forgiven me and delivered me from the
   guilt of sin. I might fall a thousand times a day, but, "I am the
   Lord's." I might fall foully but not finally, for, "I am the
   Lord's"--and being the Lord's, He holds me in His hands and none shall
   pluck me from His gracious grasp!

   "I am the Lord's." This is my hope of safety and of perfection. If I am
   the Lord's, then He has begun a good work in me and He will not leave
   off till He has performed all that He purposed concerning me! He will
   have respect to the work of His hands. I have heard that when Gustave
   Dore left Paris, before the siege, he hid one of his most beautiful
   pictures under a heap of stones in a cellar. Only he knew where it was
   and, when the siege was over, Dore hastened to the place, for he had a
   respect to the work of his hands, and though his picture lay hidden
   there, you may be sure that he soon disinterred it and completed it.
   And, sometimes, the Lord's people seem to get down under the stones in
   the cellar, but He will find them. If you are the Lord's, He will not
   leave you to perish! He will go on with His work and finish the task He
   has commenced till you shall reflect His wisdom and display His power!

   "I am the Lord's." Why, I think I will turn this confession into a
   hymn! I will not rhyme it, but let it stand as it is, "I am the
   Lord's." Sing it in your souls! Let the joy bells of your heart ring it
   out, "I am the Lord's. I shall die in the Lord, I shall rise again at
   the sounding of the archangel's trumpet, I shall see my Lord's face in
   Glory, I shall be forever with Him, for I am the Lord's." If you come
   to the Communion Table with this sweet reflection in your hearts, and
   then go from the table with this Truth of God worked out practically in
   your lives, it shall be well with you!

   My dear Hearers, I wish you could all say, "I am the Lord's." I would
   to God you would all put your trust in Christ and take Him to be yours.
   When you have done that, then do not hesitate to come and confess Him
   before men! God help you to do, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH44.

   In this chapter God encourages His Church by a promise of the
   visitation of His Spirit. Oh, that it may be fulfilled to us, also!

   Verses 1-3. Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant; and Israel, whom I have
   chosen: thus says the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb,
   which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, My servant; and you, Jeshurun,
   whom I have chosen. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and
   floods upon the dry ground: I will pour My Spirit upon your seed, and
   My blessing upon your offspring: That is exactly what we need! Oh, that
   God would thus revive His Church! A little while ago you saw the earth
   become dry and brown and bare--the very pastures were chapped and
   parched and opened their mouths to cry for rain. What could we have
   done if the clouds had still withheld their nourishment? But at last,
   down came the refreshing showers and all the face of nature was
   revived! What we have had upon our fields, we need upon our Churches!
   Nothing will do for our souls but a visitation of the Spirit. Let us
   pray for it. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Rain, pour out Your
   life-giving treasures upon thirsty souls even as the floods have been
   poured out upon the dry ground! Here is a Divine promise, let us plead
   it--"I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the
   dry ground: I will pour My Spirit upon your seed and My blessing upon
   your offspring."

   4. And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water
   courses. You must often have noticed how you can trace the course of a
   brook by the willow trees that grow upon its banks. When you cannot see
   the brook from a distance, you can see the willows. So, wherever the
   Spirit of God comes, young people are converted--we see our children
   growing up in God's fear--and we know that this is the result of the
   Spirit's working.

   5, 6. One shall say, I am the LORD'S; and another shall call himself by
   the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the
   LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel. Thus says the LORD,
   the King of Israel, and His redeemer, the LORD of hosts; I am the
   First, and I am the Last; and beside Me there is no God. This is spoken
   in the Lord's usual majestic style--does it not remind you of the words
   of our Lord Jesus as recorded in the Book of the Revelation? "I am
   Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, says the Lord, which is,
   and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty." How can He be less
   than Divine who rightly adopts the same style which Jehovah uses in the
   Prophets--"I am the First, and I am the Last; and beside Me there is no
   God"?

   7. And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order
   for Me, since I appointed the ancient people? And the things that are
   coming, and shall come, let them show unto them. The great God
   challenges all pretended gods to compete with Him and to show that they
   have ever prophesied or foretold the future! One of the greatest proofs
   of the Inspiration of Scripture and that our God is the only living and
   true God, is that the prophecies up to now have been literally
   fulfilled. Go to Bashan, or to Edom, or to Sidon, or to Egypt--and
   wherever you go, you will see that whatever the Lord said concerning
   the ancient nations and peoples and cities has been carried out to the
   very letter!

   8. Fear you not, neither be afraid: have not I told you from that time,
   and have declared it? You are even My witnesses. Is there a God beside
   Me? Yes, there is no God, I know not any. "There is no God" in the
   world but Jehovah, the one living and true God whom we adore! Now
   follows that very wonderful passage descriptive of the making of idols,
   which we have often read. If there are any of you who worship crosses,
   crucifixes, or any other visible objects, please remember that God's
   command is spoken as much to you as to any other idolaters! We may not
   worship anything that can be seen or handled, for this is the Law laid
   down by God Himself--"You shall not make unto you any engraved image,
   or any likeness of anything that is in Heaven above, or that is in the
   earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: you shall not
   bow down yourself to them, nor serve them." Here, then, is God's
   description of idol gods.

   9. They that make an engraved image are all of them, vanity. They must
   be very empty-headed and foolish people, or they would not worship a
   thing which they have engraved with their own hands.

   9. And their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own
   witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. Idolaters
   are just as wooden and doltish as their idols, or else they would know
   better than to worship them.

   10-12. Who has formed a god, or molten engraved image that is
   profitable for nothing? Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and
   the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let
   them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.
   The smith with the tongs both works in the coals, and fashions it with
   hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms: yes, he is hungry,
   and his strength fails: he drinks no water, and is faint. Here is a
   god-maker with his tongs, and his coals, and his hammers--yet this
   god-maker gets hungry and faint! Here comes another--

   13. The carpenter stretches out his rule; he marks it out with a line;
   he fits it with planes, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes
   it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it
   may remain in the house. Fancy a god-maker with his rule and his line,
   his planes and his compasses! What fine irony there is here

   14. He hews him down cedars, and takes the cypress and the oak, which
   he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest; he plants an
   ash, and the rain does nourish it. The forest is growing stuff to make
   gods with out of ash, and oak, and cedar, and cypress!

   15. Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and
   warm himself. He cuts up part of the tree for fuel, and warms himself
   with it!

   15-17. Yes, he kindles it, and bakes bread; yes, he makes a god, and
   worships it; he makes it an engraved image, and falls down thereto. He
   burns part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eats flesh; he
   roasts roast, and is satisfied: yes, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I
   am warm, I have seen the fire: and the residue thereof he makes a god,
   even his engraved image: he falls down unto it, and worships it, and
   prays unto it, and says, Deliver me; for you are my god. And have not
   we seen hundreds of persons adoring a doll, or a little picture said to
   be a likeness of the virgin, or something of that kind? Ah, me, that
   even under the garb of Christianity the lowest kind of idolatry should
   still be common among our fellow men! God grant that none of us may
   ever fall into this deadly evil!

   18-20. They have not known nor understood: for He has shut their eyes,
   that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
   And none considers in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor
   understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yes, also I
   have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and
   eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? Shall I
   fall down to the stock of a tree? He feeds on ashes. As madmen will
   sometimes devour ashes, so surely men who worship things that they have
   made or bought must be mad--"He feeds on ashes."

   20. A deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his
   soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? If you shall
   worship the crucifix, or anything else that is visible, you are
   dishonoring yourself and you are breaking the Law of God! Remember
   that, "God is a Spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in
   spirit and in truth." He will have no similitude. This He abhors with
   His whole heart and will hold no one guiltless who worships an idol of
   any kind! Even though the man has reverentially and sincerely bowed
   before it, he is transgressing against God! These are the false
   gods--now we shall read of the one true God

   21. Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for you are My servant: I have
   formed you. "You have not formed Me, as these idolaters make their
   gods, but I have formed you."

   21. You are My servant: O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of Me. God
   does not forget His people. If you are trusting in Him, you may forget
   Him through your infirmity, but because of His infinite love, He will
   never forget you.

   22. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as
   a cloud, your sins: return unto Me; for I have redeemed you. First He
   pardoned their sins and then He bade them return to Him. What a wonder
   of mercy this is--Free Grace removing sin and then the sweet
   constraints of gratitude drawing the forgiven sinner near his God!

   23. Sing, O you heavens, for the LORD has done it: shout, you lower
   parts of the earth: break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest,
   and every tree therein: for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified
   Himself in Israel. Pardoned sin is enough to make even the rocks sing!
   Mountains, trees, forests and even the lower parts of the earth are
   made to echo with song when sin is blotted out!

   24. Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and He that formed you from the
   womb, I am the LORD that makes all things; that stretches forth the
   heavens alone; that spreads abroad the earth by Myself. God does
   everything by His own unaided strength. With whom took He counsel when
   He formed the universe? Who instructed the Ever-Blessed when He made
   the heavens and the earth! He did it all by His own wisdom and power.

   25. That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad:
   that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish. This
   is what He does to those who boast and think that they know better than
   He does. But simple hearts that will believe His Word shall know His
   will and shall grow wise unto salvation.

   26-28. That confirms the word of His servant, and performs the counsel
   of His messengers; that says to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and
   to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up the
   decayed places thereof: that says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry
   up your rivers: that says of Cyrus, he is My shepherd, and shall
   perform all My pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built;
   and to the temple, your foundation shall be laid. This Book of the
   Prophet Isaiah was written long before the days of Cyrus, yet he is
   here mentioned by name, and the prophecy of what he would do is here
   given! We know how completely this prophecy was fulfilled and the Lord
   who uttered it, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is our God forever and ever! He shall
   be our Guide even unto death, blessed be His holy name! Amen.

Christians, and Their Communion With God

   (No. 2430)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 15, 1887.

   "Yes, in the way of Your judgments, O LORD have we waited for You, the
   desire of our soul is for Your name, and for the remembrance of You.
   With my soul have I desired You in the night; yes, by my spirit within
   me will I seek You early." Isaiah 26:8,9.

   IT is something when a man truly knows that there is a God. Behind the
   doubt of the existence of God, many men shield themselves and permit
   themselves to indulge in iniquities of which they might be ashamed if
   they did not make a cloak of their atheism. I would have no man live
   doubting the existence of God--such a doubt cannot help him to live
   better--it may cause him to live much worse.

   It is a great deal more, however, when men so think of God as to fear
   Him. We say, concerning criminals--it is customary to say in legal
   terms--"not having the fear of God before their eyes." There is a fear
   of God which, though it is a spirit of bondage, is, nevertheless,
   salutary, and works well for the common good. There are men, doubtless,
   who are restrained from excess of iniquity by the belief that God has
   judgments by which He can overthrow them and, that at the end they will
   have to appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ. It will be a sad day
   for this world when that fear ceases to operate upon men!

   But, Beloved, it is something infinitely higher and pertaining to quite
   a different sphere when we come truly to know God--when we have not
   merely a belief in His existence, but a distinct consciousness and
   realization of it--when we can speak of God, not as of some personage
   far away, but as of One with whom we are intimately acquainted, One who
   has been a Friend to us, One who has even communed with us as a man
   talks with his friend. Some of you cannot possibly reach to that point
   as you are, for God is a Spirit, and only spiritual men can discern
   Him--and as yet you are not partakers of the Spirit of God. Some of you
   here present are still carnally minded and the carnal mind cannot
   perceive spiritual things. Least of all can it perceive that highest
   spiritual object, the ever-blessed God! "You must be born again," for,
   "except a man is born again (from above), he cannot see the Kingdom of
   God." We may set it out before your eyes in glorious light, but it is
   not light that the blind man needs, it is eyes! And eyes must be given
   to you who are spiritually blind if you are ever to see God. There is
   One who has come on purpose to open the eyes of the blind and if your
   eyes are opened by Him, then shall you see God and truly begin to know
   Him! This spiritual vision makes a grave distinction between those who
   know God and those who do not know Him. And it is produced by a
   wondrous change called regeneration, in which darkness passes away and
   the true Light of God dawns upon the spirit.

   I. Now, coming to our text, I shall have to say, first, that THERE IS,
   IN THE PEOPLE OF GOD, A PRINCIPLE OF COMMUNION WITH GOD.

   For, first, this is where their spiritual life begins. "I will arise
   and go to my father," was the proof that the prodigal was really
   restored in heart. When he cleansed himself, touched himself up and
   joined himself to a citizen of that country and began to work instead
   of wasting his substance in riotous living, it was a considerable
   improvement. It is always a good thing for a man to work rather than to
   waste his time in the indulgence of his vices. But he had not, then,
   begun to live spiritually. It was when he remembered his father and the
   cry of his spirit was, "I will arise and go to my father," that the
   gracious work was begun in his soul!

   Beloved, if any of you are seeking after righteousness by your own
   works, or by your prayers, I do not know that this is a token of a new
   life. It may be that you are even in the dark seeking after God if,
   perhaps, you may find Him there, but when there rises in your spirit
   this thought, "I must find God, I must come to God, I must confess my
   sin unto the Lord, I

   must lay myself at the Lord's feet, I must meet with Him," then we hope
   the best things for you! So long as you are content with ministers,
   priests, sacraments, books, prayers and all that you can do, you are
   satisfied with the mere shell! But when there awakens in your spirit
   this desire, "It is God whom I have offended; unto God will I make my
   confession. It is from God that I need pardon, oh, that I knew where I
   might find Him! I would come even to His seat." When there is formed
   within your spirit this resolve, "I will seek the Lord's face until He
   turns to me in love and accepts me as His child"--then it is that
   spiritual life begins. Your first true dealings with God, after a
   spiritual fashion, are infinitely more important than all the outward
   forms of religion, whatever they may be! I am not judging one form more
   than another, but, if you are content with the externals and do not
   come to the internals. If you do not come to close grips with God and
   humble yourself before Him, you know not, as yet, what spiritual life
   really means! This, then, is where spiritual life begins--with coming
   into communion with God.

   And, Beloved, this is where the life of the real Christian grows and
   makes advances. We behold the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
   and that gives us hope. That gives us peace. That gives us rests and in
   proportion as we know more of God, as He reveals Himself in the Person
   of His dear Son, our Graces grow. Faith has for its meat and its drink
   the knowledge of God. Knowing Him, and His exceedingly great and
   precious promises, we come to rest in Him more fully. Ignorance is the
   enemy of faith, but a knowledge of God greatly strengthens and
   increases our confidence in Him. You do not grow in Grace, my Brothers
   and Sisters, by listening to fine oratory, even though it is of a
   sacred kind. The real growth comes to you when God the Holy Spirit,
   Himself, dwells with you. It is not when you have been so many minutes
   on your knees, or have read so many chapters in the Bible, that you
   necessarily grow--it is when you have spoken with God, and God has
   spoken with you--when He who is the Alpha of your spiritual life is all
   the letters of it right up to the Omega! He has worked all our works in
   us, and without Him we can do nothing. He is the truly strong man who
   lives near to God. That man can do anything who throws Himself back on
   the all sufficiency of the Most High. Rest upon yourself, or trust in
   anything below the stars, and you will dwindle and decay. But rest in
   God, and come into close contact with the Divine Invisible--let your
   rock and refuge be His throne--and you will go from strength to
   strength by the power of God the Holy Spirit that shall dwell in you!

   Next, beloved Friends, it becomes to the Believer the tenor of his life
   to please God. That is a beautiful testimony that is borne concerning
   Enoch--"Before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased
   God." There are many who have not yet even thought of doing such a
   thing as this, and there are some who may have thought of it who,
   perhaps, have not yet attained to it. But what a blessed thing it is
   for a man to be brought to trust in the Lord Jesus and to seek the
   Glory of the Savior and to yield his will to God's will! And to feel
   that God is his All and in all that He does, he strives to please God!
   You know what it is to be pleased with your child and pleased with what
   he has done. It is not per-fect--from your standpoint you can see many
   imperfections--but still, it is most acceptable as coming from your
   child. He has done it with all his heart and you are well pleased with
   him.

   Well now, that should be the tenor, and it is the tenor of the life of
   every man who has really been renewed in the spirit of his mind by the
   work of the Spirit of God! Jesus could truly say of His Father, "I
   always do those things that please Him." And in proportion as we grow
   like Jesus, this becomes a true description of our lives--they are well
   pleasing unto God. What a contrast there is between the man who pleases
   God and the ungodly man! The ungodly man does what pleases himself, or
   what pleases his wife, or what will please his neighbors. But the
   Christian man, although he is willing to please his neighbor for his
   good to edification, yet aims first at this mark--not to please men,
   but to please God. This makes his life altogether different from the
   life of the man who has not God in all his thoughts.

   Again, Beloved, this principle of communion with God becomes the very
   flower of our lives. When are we happiest? There is no room for
   question here--every Believer knows that he is happiest when nearest to
   his God. I hope that for the most part we enjoy such full communion
   with God that our peace is like a river. But there are times of great
   tidal waves of fellowship when we get nearer to God than at other
   seasons. We have our Tabors and our transfiguration glories. We can
   sometimes say, "Whether in the body, or out of the body, we cannot
   tell: God knows." And we then know nothing else but God--we seem
   wrapped up in Him! I am not speaking of any mysticism, although it does
   happen that among the mystical writers this experience is most often
   spoken of. This is a joy which belongs to all Believers when they enter
   into the secret place of the Most High and abide under the shadow of
   the Almighty!

   The Christian man is not at his best when he is healthiest, or when he
   is wealthiest, or when he has been most successful, or when he has had
   the praise of men. No, the day in which the flower of his life has come
   to the climax of its beauty and pours out its sweetest perfumes--the
   day in which his life is life, life indeed, is when he is drinking in
   that loving kindness of God which is better, even, than life itself!
   See, then, as the worldling finds his highest enjoyment here or there,
   the Christian finds the summit of his joy in fellowship with his God!

   I must not leave this point till I have said one other thing about this
   principle of communion with God--this is the hunger and this is the
   thirst of the Christian. "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God."
   To get near to God is the great passion of our spirit. To accomplish
   this to the fullest, we would face grim Death in his den! Yes,
   sometimes we could almost use the extravagant language of Rutherford,
   when he declared that if God were on the other side, to get at Him he
   would swim through seven Hells, for nothing can keep back the
   impetuosity of a heart that is all aflame with love to God and feels
   that all its Heaven lies in communion with Him!

   Well now, dear Friends, if you and I are conscious that this is true,
   that there is in us a principle of fellowship with God, then notice
   that this proves that there has been a Divine renewal worked in us. It
   was not so once. Alas, it was very much otherwise! If news could have
   been truly proclaimed that God was dead, some of you would have been
   very happy to hear it, for you would have been no more worried with
   thoughts of eternity and of the Day of Judgement! But now, what an
   awful thing it would be for you if, even for a moment, you indulged the
   thought that there was no God! Why, you would have lost everything! All
   joy would have vanished from you in an instant if God were not real to
   you! Then what a change is this, a radical change, one which could only
   have been worked by supernatural power--as great a change as when the
   dead rise from their corruption and come forth into newness of life!

   This proves your sonship, too, for no man cries after God and longs for
   fellowship with Him, except it is upon the principle of, "Abba,
   Father." Slaves do not crave the presence of their masters! It is sons
   who long to be with their father. You are a true son of the Highest if
   you hunger and thirst after God!

   This proves your holiness, too, in a measure, for like will to like and
   if your heart pants after God, you have been made a partaker of the
   Divine Nature so far, at least, that you are now striving after
   holiness, or else I am sure you would not be seeking after God. Unholy
   hearts feel a repulsion to the holy God and seek to fly from Him. But
   the holy soul longs for communion with the holy God. That is a clear
   proof that you have had implanted within you a spiritual nature! There
   is within you, now, a new heart and a right spirit! You have passed
   into the higher life. You have become a spiritual man, otherwise you
   would not long for this spiritual God!

   This proves your heavenliness, too, for that same desire which draws
   you to God is drawing you to Heaven. What is Heaven but to be with God?
   And He who now is drawing you with cords of a man and with bands of
   love, to His own glorious self, is by that very process drawing you
   towards the place where He reveals His face! And He is also making you
   fit for that Beatific Vision which shall be your everlasting happiness!

   II. Now, secondly--and I must be brief on many points here--THIS
   PRINCIPLE DISPLAYS ITSELF AND

   WORKS IN VARIOUS WAYS.

   Begin the text--"Yes, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, have we
   waited for You." We are longing for God and it is dark and cloudy--what
   shall we do? Why, wait for Him. Instead of impatiently complaining of
   His Providential dispensations which would be flying off at a tangent
   from Him, we stand still that we may see the salvation of God! We have
   come to our Red Sea and we can go no farther. And now our love to God,
   our fellowship with Him makes us just abide where we are until He says,
   "Go forward." And then we march through the sea, dry-shod. Waiting is
   often a very heavenly experience. You will find it a difficult thing to
   do if you doubt. He that doubts, hurries and worries, but he that
   believes does not make haste through cowardly fear! He waits and sings
   to himself, "My Soul, wait you only upon God; for my expectation is
   from Him."

   This waiting is expectation. It means, "I cannot see the way out of
   this difficulty, but I shall see it. I do not yet perceive God's plan
   for my deliverance. but I shall be delivered. I do not know how bread
   shall be given me, but I shall have it even if God has to send ravens
   with it, or to rend Heaven, itself, in two! I shall have His promises
   fulfilled and I will wait His time." This patiently waiting upon God is
   one of the blessed displays of a spirit that is at perfect peace with
   God and longs to keep in fellowship with Him.

   "Yes," says the text, "in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, have we
   waited for You." Sometimes, the way of God's judgments may mean the
   appointed way, the regular way. I believe that God's people love prayer
   because it is one of the ways in which God meets with them. You love
   the House of Prayer and the hearing of the Gospel because it is in the
   sanctuary and in the preaching of the Gospel that God has often met
   with you. We have had many happy Sabbaths, here, and on these little
   Sabbaths in the middle of the week, as I often call our Thursday night
   services, the Lord has manifested Himself to us as He does not unto the
   world and we have waited for Him expecting to meet Him in His house.
   These Believers waited upon God until the ordained time for deliverance
   from His judgments. Perhaps the husband or the child was dead, or,
   possibly, the judgments were of another kind. Famine desolated the
   land--the water in the brooks was dried up. Enemies were all over the
   country ravaging with their sword and their bow--blood flowed freely
   and then God's servants waited for God. They expected that He would
   come at such a time of need and display Himself in some unusual manner.
   My Brother, my Sister, whenever you have a great trouble, expect a
   great mercy! You will find it the path of wisdom when you have a great
   joy, to be afraid, but when you have a great sorrow, then have a high
   anticipation of blessing! That big wave is washing up some jewel that
   lay deep down at the bottom of the sea--it would never have come to
   your feet if it had not been for the storm that washed it where you can
   now find it!

   Sometimes the Lord comes with spiritual judgments to His people. He
   blights and blasts and withers all their hopes and they are ready to
   despair. Yet they must not despair, but each one must say, "Lord, show
   me why You contend with me. Now come in and deal with me in mercy. When
   You have stripped me, when You have scourged me, yes, when You have
   slain me, then come and fulfill Your Word, 'Your dead men shall live,
   together with my dead body shall they arise.'" Beloved, see what it is
   to wait upon God in His judgments! You know how hypocrites do--they
   wait upon God, cap in hand, while His service pays them--but as soon as
   ever the Lord begins to try them, or somebody laughs at them, or their
   religion seems to injure their business, then good-bye to religion! But
   they are the true men who can truthfully say, "In the way of Your
   judgments, O Lord, have we waited for You."

   You can tell a good dog when you see him follow his master. Though
   somebody who wants to steal him offers him a dainty bone, he will have
   nothing to do with him, but he will keep close to his master's heels.
   And the true Believer follows God when he seems to get nothing by
   it--even when he appears to be a loser by it. He loves not God with a
   cupboard love, for what he gets from Him in this world, but with a
   child's love, which says, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him."
   So, you see, this communion with God leads to waiting for Him.

   Sometimes we do not seem as if we could get quite as far as that, and
   then this communion leads to desiring--"The desire of our soul is to
   Your name." We want to know the Character of God which is set forth in
   His name. We love that Character! We desire to have it and to reflect
   it in our own lives. Our desire is to God's name which signifies not
   only His Character, but His honor and His Glory. We desire to see Him
   glorified! Our heart is glad when Christ is glorified and our spirit is
   sad when His name is dishonored.

   Surely, this name means the Word of God, for the Word of God is God's
   name written large, and we have a desire towards God's Word! O Beloved,
   the longer one lives upon God's Word, the more he feels that he cannot
   endure anything which is other than God's Word! There is a great
   difference between the largest words of men and the very smallest words
   of God, if such there are. I have heard of a certain Divine who
   preached a sermon and afterwards asked an aged man what he thought of
   it. This was a very foolish thing for him to do. The old man answered,
   "Well, I have not much to say." "But," enquired the minister, "did you
   not think that there were capital divisions and wonderful distinctions
   in the sermon?" He said, "Yes; but there was one distinction you seemed
   to me to forget in your sermon." "What was that?" "The distinction
   between meat and bone--you gave us a large quantity of bone, but I did
   not perceive that I had any meat--and there is a vast distinction
   there." When a man once gets to feed upon the Word of God, all the rest
   is bones, and he lets the dogs have them. But as for himself, he needs
   spiritual meat and he must have it! Cannot many of you say that you
   desire to know the Character of God and to reflect it--that you desire
   to spread the Glory of God and that you desire to feed upon the Word of
   God? Your desire is to His name!

   And, once more, your desire is to remember the Lord--"And to the
   remembrance of You." I wish that I had a memory that was so narrow that
   it could only hold the things of God! Do you not sometimes find that if
   you hear a bad thing, it sticks in your memory? Oh, what an abominable
   memory that is which lays hold of all the draft of Sodom and cannot get
   rid of it, while the timbers that come floating down from Lebanon are
   often allowed to go by! But our desire is to the remembrance of God--I
   am sure that it is. Oh, that I did always remember Him when I wake and
   until I sleep--and in my dreams still remember Him and if I wake in the
   night be still with Him! This is what we want! Our fellowship with God
   is such that if we do not always remember Him, yet our desire is still
   towards the remembrance of Him, and we desire to see repeated what we
   remember of Him. If He has drawn us a thousand times, we desire that He
   would draw us yet again. And for the great world and the one Church of
   Christ in it, our cry is, "Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the
   Lord! Awake as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are You
   not He that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?" Our desire is that
   we might see Him again as we have seen Him in the sanctuary--and see
   Him as His goings were of old when He showed Himself mighty in the
   deliverance of His people! I, for one, can say that my soul desires
   this beyond anything. Oh, that He would do, again, what He did in our
   fathers' days! He can do it and He will! This is the desire of His
   people. Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly, we beseech You!

   Then, again, observe that this principle of communion shows itself in a
   personal yearning. Did you notice, as we read the chapter, that the
   eighth verse is in the plural and the ninth verse is in the singular?
   "Yes, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, have we waited for You; the
   desire of our soul is to Your name and to the remembrance of You. With
   my soul have I desired you in the night." O Brothers and Sisters, this
   lonely, personal desire of the Believer after God, is another form of
   fellowship with Him! Sometimes, we feel as if we were in the darkness
   of night, all alone--there is nobody to speak with us, or to speak for
   us. Then what a blessing it is if we can say, "With my soul have I
   desired You in the night"! Then have I needed no other candle for my
   darkened chamber, no other sun to make my day, but my Lord and His
   sweet Presence! I will not dwell on this experience because I think
   that many of you can say that it is so with you, also. It has been very
   dark with you. You have had a world of inward trouble, but still, above
   it all, there has been this desire after God, for you could not do
   without Him. You have said concerning your choicest earthly comforts--

   "If you should take them all away,

   Yet would I not repine.

   If you, my God, will but come to me,

   Let them all go, for I have all

   I need when I ha ve Thee."

   This principle of communion takes one other form, that of personal
   seeking--"Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek You early"--seek
   You with my spirit, not with lip-service or head-service, but with
   heart-service, with my spirit within me! There is a great deal to be
   done indoors, Brothers and Sisters, and there are some who are so busy
   outside that they do not attend to anything inside. But it is a blessed
   thing when the soul in its inward parts is all alive in seeking after
   God--"With my spirit within me will I seek You." And notice that it is,
   "I will seek You early." I will be out on time. I will waste not a
   moment, I will not delay. I will seek You and I will seek You now.

   I have a wish springing up in my heart that some here present would
   begin to seek the Lord now. But if any of you have sought Him and have
   known Him and you have lost communion with Him, seek the renewal of
   that communion at once! Do not think that it will take weeks for you to
   get back where you once were. Conversion may take place in a second of
   time and so may restoration! It is not always so--it may be a long
   process--but it is sometimes very speedy. "Before I was aware, my soul
   made me like the chariots of Amminadib." I think that some of us have
   known what it is to feel as dull and stupid as a silly sheep. But while
   we have been in the House of God, or while we have been alone, suddenly
   the Spirit of the Lord has visited us and we have taken the wings of
   eagles and have been up and away! And we wondered what had happened to
   us, for we had been turned from a deadly state into one of life and
   vigor!

   Listen to this text and see how short a business this heart-reviving
   is. "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." What is needed? "If any
   man hears My voice and opens the door." It does not take long to open a
   door, does it? Yet that is all Christ asks of us! He does not say, "If
   anybody sweeps the house and gets the supper ready, I will come and
   partake of it." No, but, "If any man hears My voice and opens the door,
   I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me." Dear
   Heart, you know your Lord--you know His voice and the very sound of His
   fingers on the door! Open to Him! Say, "Come in, my Lord. If I have
   kept You out, my Dearly-Beloved. If I have kept You out till Your head
   is wet with dew and Your locks with the drops of the night, I beg ten
   thousand pardons of You! Come in, I beseech You, and sup with me, that
   I also may sup with You." It can soon be done and I pray that it may
   be. At any rate, this is how God's child often has to cry--"Come to me,
   Lord! With my spirit within me will I seek You early."

   Perhaps somebody says, "Well, I have been praying the Lord to come to
   me, but I have not at once had His company." How did you expect Him to
   come? "I thought I would be made glad," you say. Yes, but the Lord
   sometimes comes to His people and humbles them--and when your soul is
   humbled in the dust, it may be certain that the Lord is with you--quite
   as certain as if you were full of joy! Sometimes He comes to us with
   the spirit of chastisement and rebuke. Well, do not pick and choose--so
   long as He comes! Seek Him early, for He comes for your good and He
   will come and bless you.

   III. I was to have said, thirdly, that THE LORD TAKES PLEASURE IN THIS
   COMMUNION WITH HIS PEOPLE, but I must not detain you.

   I will just point out that the next to the last verse in this chapter
   shows how the Lord loves the fellowship of His people. He invites them
   to commune with Him--"Come, My people." He points out the way to
   fellowship--"Enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about
   you." That is, get alone with your God. Then He provides for this
   communion--Christ is our hiding place and He, Himself comes to meet
   us--"Come My people." I invite you, Beloved, tonight if you can, or as
   soon as you can, to have a special season given up to nothing else but
   fellowship with God, that you may now begin, again, a fellowship which
   afterwards shall not easily be broken. Pray! If you feel that you
   cannot pray, read. Let God speak to you. Get into conversation with
   Him, somehow. A conversation, you know, needs two to engage in it. Hear
   what God says to you, read a passage from His Word. And then pray. If
   you find you cannot pray, praise! Say something to Him and then read,
   again, and let Him speak to you. But come not away until He has spoken
   to you and you have very distinctly spoken with Him. Let this be the
   burden of your prayer, "Lord, I want to come to You; I want, through
   Jesus Christ, my Mediator, to have fellowship with You, and to abide in
   Him in nearness to You." May the Lord help you in this matter, for
   truly there is no life like it!

   I wish that I could invite all here present to such a life as that, but
   there is, as I have told you before, the previous step. There must be
   the new birth--there must be faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. This is
   the Gospel which we have continually to preach to you, "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." And then you shall know that
   there is a God! Then you shall have fellowship with God and then your
   life shall be, in its measure, like the life of those in Heaven who
   behold the Lord's face and serve Him day and night in His Temple.

   May the Lord bless these words to all of us, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH26

   Verse 1. In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah. God
   would have His people to be a singing people! They often sigh--they
   should more often sing. God makes their songs and appoints the song for
   the day, and so helps them to cheer the darkest day with some melodious
   music.

   1. We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and
   bulwarks. Jerusalem may fall, her walls may be destroyed till not one
   stone is left upon another, but still, "we have a strong city." In the
   salvation of God we live and are safe. Our place of defense shall be
   the munitions of rocks. The eternal purposes of God shall guard the
   safety of His people.

   2. Open you the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps the Truth
   of God may enter in. This city is for the righteous, for those who keep
   the Truth of God. They are to dwell in this city--not fighting in the
   open, not wandering in the plains--but dwelling at ease behind the
   massive walls and bulwarks which God Himself has appointed in His
   salvation.

   3. You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You:
   because he trusts in You. This is our city. By faith, we enter into the
   purposes and promises of God and there we dwell in perfect peace! The
   adversary may thunder outside the walls, but what of that? He may
   threaten that He will capture the city, but how can he do so when the
   Lord is there? This is a sweet, sweet verse--may you all get the very
   marrow of it! "You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
   on You: because he trusts in You."

   4. Trust you in the LORD forever. Not sometimes, but always. Not for a
   certain number of days during your season of trial, but if the trial
   should last a lifetime, "trust you in the Lord forever."

   4. For in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength. If He could fail
   you, you would do well to be looking out for another shelter. But since
   His strength is everlasting, let your faith also be everlasting. Lives
   there a man who has fully trusted in God and yet has been confused? Is
   there one anywhere who has really relied upon the invisible power of
   Jehovah and yet has found Him fail in the hour of need? It cannot and
   it shall not be!

   5, 6. For He brings down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, He
   lays it low; He lays it low, even to the ground; He brings it even to
   the dust. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and
   the steps of the needy. This is always God's way--overturning the great
   and the proud and casting down the mighty works of men, so that he who
   trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm soon finds himself in a pitiful
   condition. All the proud, who glory in their own power, shall be as
   when a city is battered down and the very dust is trodden by "the feet
   of the poor, and the steps of the needy."

   7. The way of the just is uprightness: You, Most Upright, do weigh the
   path of the just. God makes a plain path for His own people and He,
   knowing their way, forms a right estimate of it. Let them never fear
   for a moment that He will condemn them because of the condemnation of
   their fellow men! He takes care, Himself, to weigh the path of the just
   and His scales cannot err.

   8, 9. Yes, in the way of Your judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
   You; the desire of our soul is to Your name, and to the remembrance of
   You. With my soul have I desired You in the night; yes, with my spirit
   within and will I seek You early: for when Your judgments are in the
   earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. You
   notice that the song given to us in this chapter is all concerning God.
   We are bid to trust in Him, we are told how safe are they that do so,
   we are shown how futile is all strength apart from Him and now the
   desire of His saints is set forth as being toward Him, and toward Him
   alone.

   10. Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn
   righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and
   will not behold the majesty of the LORD. Until men are changed in
   heart, and renewed in nature, they will not see God. If you could
   transport them to the land of uprightness, where there would be no sin
   to tempt them, yet even then they would not know the Lord! Still is our
   Savior's message true, "You must be born again." O unconverted men and
   women, we look upon you through our tears because you are incapable of
   everything that is good and right until the Lord, in Covenant mercy,
   renews your hearts and brings you to know Him! Of the ungodly man it is
   truly declared, "In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and
   will not behold the majesty of the Lord."

   11. LORD, when Your hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
   shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yes, the fire of
   Your enemies shall devour them. There are some people who will not see
   and, as the old proverb has it, there are none so blind as those that
   will not see. But they will one day be made to see, if not to their
   salvation, then to their everlasting shame and confusion! They shall be
   made to see that, after all, there is a God and that He is strong to
   punish the ungodly, and to overthrow His adversaries! I pray that no
   one of you may refuse to see by the light of the Gospel until he is
   forced to see by the blaze of the Judgment Day. Yet, alas, there will
   be such!

   12. LORD, You will ordain peace for us: for You have also worked all
   our works in us. That is a delightful verse! An ordination is spoken of
   here, for God has ordained peace for His people and they must have
   it--and they shall have it! On the other hand, His people ordain glory
   for Him, for they declare, "You have also worked all our works in us."
   Thus we also sing--

   "Andevery virtue wepossess, And every victory won, And every thought of
   holiness, Are His alone."

   13. O LORD our God, other lords beside You have had dominion over us:
   but by You only will we make mention of Your name. "O Lord, how sadly,
   how long, how grievously did those other lords domineer over us! But
   from this time forth we will know no name but Yours and, when we
   mention it, it shall be by Your Grace, and by Your power, alone, that
   we even put our trust in Your wondrous name!

   14. They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall
   not rise: therefore have You visited and destroyed them, and made all
   their memory to perish. Yes, our lusts are all dead! They will never
   live again, thank God! The Sword of the Spirit has slain them--"they
   are deceased." We want to have nothing more to do with them, we desire
   that the very memory of them should perish.

   15. You have increased the nation, O LORD, You have increased the
   nation: You are glorified. God is always glorified in the increase of
   His people. Therefore we should, above all other reasons, pray for the
   increase of the Church because God will thereby be glorified.

   15, 16. You had removed it far unto all the ends of the earth. LORD, in
   trouble have they visited You, they poured out a prayer when Your
   chastening was upon them. That is true of hypocrites! But it is also
   sweetly true of some whom God is bringing to Himself. Child after child
   has died, loss after loss has broken down the business. Now they turn
   to God. Oh, it is a blessed loss that makes us find our God! What we
   gain is infinitely more than what we have lost. What a mercy that God
   is willing to hear us in the time of trouble, that all our putting off
   and rejection of Him do not make Him put us off! I remember one who
   wished to hire a horse and buggy to go to a certain town and he went to
   the place where he could hire it, and asked the price. He thought that
   it was too much, so he went round the town to other people and found
   that he could not get it any cheaper. But when he came back to the
   place first visited, the owner said to him, "Oh, no, no! I will not let
   my horses to you. You have been round to everybody else, and now you
   come back to me because you cannot get what you want elsewhere. I will
   have nothing to do with you." That is man's way of dealing with his
   fellow man, but it is not the Lord's method of dealing with us! When
   you and I have gone round to everybody else, the Lord still welcomes us
   when we come back to Him! Yes, just as harbors of refuge are meant for
   ships in distress that would not have put in there except for the storm
   and danger, such is the mercy of the Lord God in Jesus Christ. If you
   are forced to accept it, you are still welcome to it! If you are driven
   to it by stress of weather, you may come in, for the harbor was made
   for just such as you are.

   17, 18. Like as a woman with child, that draws near the time of her
   delivery, is in pain, and cries out in her pangs, so have we been in
   Your sight O LORD. We have been with child, we have been in pain, we
   have, as it were, brought forth wind; we have not worked any
   deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
   fallen. Ah, no, all the agonies of a mind, all the troubles of a soul
   cannot save it! This is the work of Grace. This is the gift of God!
   What a mercy it is that such a cheering promise as this next verse
   contains comes in just here

   19. Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
   arise. That note of resurrection comes in as a word of comfort to the
   most dispirited, the most despairing. As the dead shall live because of
   Christ, even so is there hope for you who are driven to a very death of
   despair! You cannot live by your own power. Your hopes are all gone,
   dead and buried, and you lie helpless and lost--but as the Lord will
   raise the dead from their graves--so will He give you hope and bless
   and save you, if you come and trust in Him.

   19-21. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the
   dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. Come, My people,
   enter into your chambers and shut your doors about you: hide yourself,
   as it were, for a little moment, until the indignation is past. For,
   behold, the LORD comes out of His place to punish the inhabitants of
   the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood,
   and shall no more cover her slain. The blood of the murdered shall cry
   to God from the ground, as did Abel's. The slain in battle shall not be
   forgotten. God will come and punish the earth for its iniquities.
   Blessed are they that hide themselves in Christ, till the indignations
   are past.

The Double Cleansing

   (No. 2431)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 18, 1887.

   "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and
   to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. And it
   shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD of Hosts, that I will cut
   off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be
   remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit
   to pass out of the land." Zechariah 13:1,2.

   WHEN you read a letter, it is well to notice the date upon it--you may
   make mistakes if you do not. The promise in our text is dated, "In that
   day." If we look a little way back, we shall find, in the 10th verse of
   the 12th chapter, these words, "I will pour upon the house of David,
   and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace and of
   supplications: and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and
   they shall mourn for Him." When the soul learns to mourn before the
   Cross, then it shall perceive that there is cleansing from sin. If you
   have looked to Christ whom you have pierced and, if so looking, you
   have come to lament and loathe your sin, it is in that day that God
   reveals to you the fountain opened for your sin and for your
   uncleanness! Are any of you, here, broken down under a sense of sin?
   Then I am glad that I have such good news for you as my text contains.
   It is for sinners that Jesus bled and died! It is for you who are
   conscious of your great guiltiness that the fullness and the freeness
   of His Grace are manifested. If you are a sinner and Jesus is a Savior,
   you are well met. If, by faith, you will look to Him, it is a proof
   that He is looking to you, and He will take away your sin and you shall
   go your way taking with you a song of love and praise unto Him who has
   so graciously saved you! So, you see that where there is mourning for
   sin, there is pardon for sin! When the eyes are full of tears of
   repentance, they are most fit for looking to Christ who takes all our
   guilt away. God help every mourner, here, to rejoice in Christ Jesus
   and His great salvation!

   According to my text, this cleansing from guilt and sin is followed by
   a reformation. There is a fountain opened, first, for the putting away
   of sin and uncleanness as to the past and present, and there follows
   upon this that God takes away the idols out of the land and even cuts
   off the very names and memory of them. God's flowers generally bloom
   double--and when He gives us the flower of pardon, He gives us the
   flower of regeneration with it! He that is made clean is also made new!
   He that takes away the guilt of sin also takes away the tendency to
   sin. God will not forgive you and still leave you to be what you were
   before, but, forgiving you, He will make a great change in you, so that
   you shall no more love the ways and the wages of iniquity, but you
   shall become, henceforth, a lover of holiness--one who desires to
   follow the Lamb wherever He goes and to walk in His ways at all times.

   I think there are some who will hear this message who will jump at such
   good tidings! They are saying in their hearts, "That is just what we
   want. We do not merely wish to be forgiven our old faults--we long to
   be made altogether holy. We desire to be set on the road to Heaven and
   to become pure in heart and holy in life." Well, this is just what God
   is prepared to do for you! And they who look to Christ shall see in the
   blood and water streaming from His riven side, the double cleansing
   that they crave--the blood to atone for guilt and the water to wash
   away the tendency towards future sin! These two things, of which I have
   spoken to you these many years, are what I have to speak about, again,
   at this time. But I do not want to merely speak about them and let it
   all end in talk. What is a mouthful of words worth? They will never
   feed the hunger of the soul. I want you to come to a personal dealing
   with God and to lay hold upon Christ and eternal life! I pray that you
   may find these two great things of which I have to speak--first, the
   cleansing from uncleanness, and then, afterwards, the cleansing of the
   life. So will you receive a gracious answer to the prayer with which we
   began our service--

   "Plenteous Grace with You is found, Grace to cover all my sin. Let the
   healing streams abound, Make and keep me pure within. You of life the
   Fountain are, Freely let me take of Thee Spring You up within my heart,
   Rise to all eternity!"

   I. To begin with the first cleansing--I will keep to the words of the
   text, for there are no words like the words of God--and the words of
   the text are the best part of the sermon. This, then, is the first head
   of my discourse, A CLEANSING FOUNTAIN OPENED. "In that day there shall
   be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of
   Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.

   In the first place, uncleanness is, in itself, a loathsome, foul thing.
   It used to be thought, in the Church of Rome, I believe, that if a
   person never washed himself, he might acquire the odor of sanctity and
   become a great saint. We believe no such thing! We fancy that
   cleanliness is the next thing to godliness and, somehow, we loathe to
   be put into association with people who abhor cold water and never wash
   themselves. Personal uncleanness is a disgusting thing and those who
   work very much among the depraved find it one of the hardest parts of
   their work, to have to put up with filthiness and uncleanness. Well
   now, that uncleanness of body is a picture of what uncleanness of soul
   is--a sinner is disgusting to God. Notwithstanding all the love that He
   has towards men and His desire to bless them, yet sin is a thing which
   the soul of God abhors! All unrighteousness is most obnoxious to Him.
   The doing of wrong is a thing which God cannot endure. He reckons it to
   be a filthy, loathsome, horrible thing. He says to the ungodly, "Oh, do
   not this abominable thing that I hate." He cannot endure sin--it is
   contrary to His holy Nature--it revolts Him. This is how the Lord sets
   forth sin to us--it is uncleanness in His sight.

   Dear Friends, I would not wonder if we feel that as sin is a filthy
   thing to the eyes of God, and He loathes it, we look upon ourselves as
   filthy beings and we loathe ourselves. It is a good sign of the working
   of Divine Grace in the heart when a man begins to feel himself
   filthy--when he says, "I cannot rest till I am washed. I cannot endure
   this uncleanness any longer. Time was when I was willing, even, to
   wallow in sin, but something has happened to me that has awakened up my
   conscience and touched my heart--and I cannot bear to remain as I am.
   Lord, wash me! Wash me! Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse
   me from my sin." You are in a good way, my dear Friend, when you begin
   to feel obnoxious to yourself, even as your sin has made you to be
   obnoxious to God! Self-loathing is one of the early stages of helpful
   spiritual life. I remember when I would have given all the world if I
   had possessed it, to escape from myself--when, as I remembered my sin,
   I wished I could have ceased to be that I might have escaped from all
   my past iniquities and from the sin that I felt sure would, in the
   future, come out of me while the fountain within was so foul and
   polluted! I pray God that everyone I am now addressing who has never
   been washed in the open fountain may be made to be loathsome to
   himself, even as his sin makes him loathsome to God!

   You remember, beloved Friends, that in the Tabernacle of old, between
   the tent of the congregation and the altar, was a laver where the
   priests might wash themselves before they offered sacrifice to God. In
   Solomon's Temple there was a molten sea, with ten lavers of brass,
   because God would not have anybody present himself unclean in His House
   of Prayer. So, our text first represents us as being by nature unclean
   and, therefore, we need washing. We cannot go into God's Holy Place and
   have fellowship with Him as we are. Do you think that God can speak
   with you as you are? Can He have commerce with sin? Can He wink at
   iniquity? Can He tolerate that which His Justice must condemn? Ah, no!
   As the unclean man, under the Jewish Law, was cut off from all
   fellowship with the worshippers of God, so is every sinner at a
   distance from God until he has been washed! I wish you would look at
   yourself, my dear Hearer. Unless you are washed in the blood of the
   Lamb, you must be regarded as out of fellowship with God, shut out from
   His Presence, under His ban, unable to draw near to God while your
   filthiness is upon you! This makes uncleanness a very dreadful
   thing--it is loathsome to God and loathsome to ourselves--and makes us
   unable to have fellowship with the thrice-holy Jehovah!

   At the same time, under the Law of God, an unclean person defiled all
   that he did. Wherever he went, he polluted everything. If he sat on a
   chair, it became defiled. If he drank out of certain vessels, they had
   to be broken. If he touched other people, he spread the defilement
   wherever he went while he was, himself, in a state of ceremonial
   uncleanness. Such was the rigor of the Law and until you are washed in
   the blood of Christ--it matters not who or what you are--you defile
   everything! If you pray, it is but the prayer of the unholy. If you
   sing, there is no music in the melody to the ear of God. Your need of a
   new heart has defiled it. All that you do, as it springs from your
   heart and conscience, which are impure, is defiled. Can a polluted
   spring send out clear streams? How can your life be right till your
   heart is right? And how can your heart be right till God, Himself, has
   renewed it by the power of His eternal Spirit and the merit of the
   blood of Christ? So you see what an awful thing it was to be unclean.
   The unclean Jew could not worship. He could not do anything in the
   midst of his brethren--he was cut off from the Tabernacle of the Lord
   until such time as he was purified.

   We have had enough of that terrible truth if you truly feel it and
   personally realize it, for now our text sweetly leads us to proclaim
   that God has provided a way of cleansing us from sin--"In that day
   there shall be a fountain opened." God has provided a means of putting
   away human sin! The newest gospel, which is no Gospel at all, denies
   this! It will not have it that the evil of the past life can be
   obliterated and the guilt of sin can be removed by the blood of Jesus.
   But, in the face of this lie, we declare, in the name of the
   Everlasting God, that there is free and full forgiveness for every kind
   and sort of sin through Jesus Christ our Lord! There is a fountain open
   and, though your life may have been as black as a life can be, we are
   bound to tell you, in the name of Jesus Christ, that He has come into
   the world to save sinners, even the very chief of them! And if you
   believe in Him there shall be no condemnation unto you! All the guilt
   of your past life shall be as though it had never been--it shall be
   cast into the depth of the sea where it shall never be brought up
   again! It shall be blotted out from the very book of Divine
   Remembrance. This is the Gospel we are sent to preach to you--

   "Pardon for crimes of deepest dye, A pardon bought with Jesus' blood,"
   and this pardon for everyone who, with a sincere heart, looks to Christ
   upon the Cross and trusts in Him.

   Note that it is God, Himself, who has provided this fountain. It was
   God, Himself, who came from Heaven to earth to be this fountain! It was
   the Son of God, Himself, who had His own heart set abroach to be the
   fountain out of which should flow the cleansing stream! I delight to
   dwell upon this theme! Were I but capable of speaking of it as it ought
   to be spoken of, I would be glad to proclaim day and night this blessed
   news--not to you sham sinners who have no sin, so you dream--but to you
   real sinners, you out-of-the-way sinners, you who have gone farthest of
   all astray from God! It is to you we tell this gladsome piece of news,
   "In that day there shall be a fountain opened for sin and for
   uncleanness."

   Next, this source of cleansing is described as a fountain because of
   its abiding efficacy. In the Tabernacle and the Temple, there stood, as
   I have already told you, those great bronze lavers. They were enormous
   cisterns holding vast quantities of water, but they were only cisterns,
   so that, when many had washed their feet and their hands in them, there
   was great need that even the lavers should be cleansed and that fresh
   water should be continually poured into them. But God has not given us
   a bronze laver or a molten sea, but a fountain, a fountain always
   flowing and never, itself, deified! However many sinners come and wash,
   the fountain washes all uncleanness away! It is not, itself, polluted,
   and the cleansing stream is always springing up, up, up! I think I see
   Paul as he washed in this Fountain. Oh, what filthiness came off Saul
   of Tarsus, but after he had washed, the Fountain was just as effectual
   for Timothy and all whom Paul brought to the Savior! And now, 1,800
   years later, we stand by the same Fountain where Paul was washed, and
   we still sing--

   "There is a Fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins!
   And sinners, plunged beneath that flood, Lose all their guilty stains.
   The dying thief rejoiced to see That Fountain in his day And there may
   I, though vile as he, Wash all my sins away!"

   It is not a cistern, nor a well into which waters run, but a Fountain
   from which there is a perpetual welling and bubbling up of fresh
   cleansing power--"In that day there shall be a fountain."

   Notice, too, that this is an opened fountain. I know that some people
   say, "We like to hear about the Gospel, but it does not seem as though
   we could get at it." Why not? It is open! When there stands in the very
   middle of the street a drinking fountain, why is it put there but that
   everybody who is thirsty may come and drink? Does anybody say, "I am
   not fit to drink at that fountain"? How is that? Whoever said anything
   about fitness? That poor boy who has been turning cartwheels in the mud
   may come and drink if he likes. Her ladyship is going by with her
   carriage--she may stop and drink if she likes. Who is the more likely
   of the two to do it, however? It is your grand, noble, gentlefolk, as
   people call them, who do not like to come and drink! Some of you may
   fancy that you are too good for Christ to cleanse, too good to be
   saved--but the poor boys that make the cartwheels do not think
   themselves too good to drink at the fountain! They are thirsty, so they
   come and drink. May the Lord grant that many here may just come and
   receive Christ in that way! He is an opened Fountain, free to all who
   will to come--and if any do not will to come, it is their own
   fault--and on their own heads must the blame lie if they do not come,
   for the Fountain is opened, and opened on purpose that the vilest of
   the vile may come and wash, and be clean!

   "A fountain opened"--that is, accessible, available. We try to preach
   about it to make it more open, but I believe that there is some
   preaching that shuts it up. People cannot understand the minister's
   philosophy--they cannot make heads or tails of it, they say. But I have
   desired to use nothing but Saxon speech and to speak to you with great
   plainness that you may understand the message of the Gospel. Jesus
   Christ took the sin of men upon Himself and suffered in their place, so
   that whoever believes in Him might not perish, but have everlasting
   life--and if you believe in Him, you are washed from your iniquity
   through the blood-shedding of the Lord Jesus Christ! If He paid our
   debts, they are paid. If He bore the penalty of our sin, it is not to
   also be borne by us, and we accept Him by faith to stand for us. We
   are, ourselves, accepted in the Beloved, set free from guilt, and saved
   in the Lord with an everlasting salvation! Well did Joseph Hart sing--

   "This Fountain, though rich, from charge is quite clear, The poorer the
   wretch, the more welcome here! Come needy, and guilty, come loathsome
   and bare, You can't come too filthy, come just as you are! This
   Fountain in vain has never been tried-- It takes out all stain whenever
   applied: The water flows sweetly with virtue Divine, To cleanse souls
   completely, though leprous as mine." I do not know where you happen to
   be, poor despairing one. Perhaps you are away there at the back of the
   gallery, but I am sent especially to you who are most despairing, to
   you who seem to be in the iron cage and cannot get out. Behold, I
   wrench away the iron bars with this Gospel word--"Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved," for there is a Fountain opened
   for sin and for uncleanness, for the great ones if they will come--for
   the house of David and for the poor ones if they will come--for the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem! If they do but come and wash in this
   Fountain, they shall be cleansed!

   Sing that one verse now in the middle of my sermon--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood Shall never lose its power, Till
   all the ransomed Church of God Be sa ved to sin no more."

   II. There follows, upon the opening of this cleansing Fountain, A GREAT
   CHANGE OF CONDUCT. In the second verse of our text we read, "It shall
   come to pass in that day, says the Lord of Hosts, that I will cut off
   the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be
   remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit
   to pass out of the land."

   When a man finds pardon, he says to himself, "Now, away go my sins;
   away go my sins. I will not spare one of them." If he has been guilty
   of drunkenness, away go the pots! If he has been a man who has used
   foul language, I have often noticed that that is a temptation that
   generally goes, directly. It has often amazed me that men who have for
   50 years scarcely spoken without an oath, from the moment they are
   converted never swear again! That seems to be a sin that dies very
   quickly--one stroke, and away it goes! I wish that all other sins went
   half as easily! But the pardoned man wakes up and finds that he has a
   great deal to do in clearing out all manner of mischief and rubbish and
   defilement--but if the Lord has really forgiven him, he says, "Out you
   go, all of you! None of you are going to stay here. I must have done
   with you forever. I will not spare one of you guilty things that made
   my Savior bleed!"--

   "'Twas you, my sins, my cruel sins, His chief tormentors were! Each of
   my crimes became a nail, And unbelief the spear."

   This clearance of sin should be very thorough. There are some who do
   not begin the new life well--they are halfhearted in giving up sin and
   they always, sooner or later, give up their profession of Christianity,
   for there was never any reality in it. But where it is the real work of
   God's Grace, there the man says, "No, no! I do not want any sin to live
   and, by God's Grace, it shall not." Perhaps he cannot, for the moment,
   overcome all sin. Old habits are still strong upon him, but he says, "I
   will never rest until they are all overthrown, for I will not continue
   under the power and sway of any one of these, my old idols. Down they
   shall come. Dagon and all the hellish crew shall be broken in pieces."
   So did we sing just now--

   "Oh, how I hate those lusts of mine That crucified my God! Those sins
   that pierced and nailed His flesh Fast to the fatal wood! While with a
   melting, broken heart, My murdered Lord I view, I'll raise revenge
   against my sins, And slay the murderers, too."

   And that is not all, for the Lord says not only that the idols shall
   go, but he declares, "I will cut off the names of the idols out of the
   land." Their very names were to be forgotten. The Jews did not like to
   pronounce the names of any of the idol gods--they thought that it
   polluted their mouths to do so. They often gave to them names in
   mockery, on purpose, to avoid using the real names. And the child of
   God says, "I do not want to even mention sin." There is great wisdom in
   what Paul says concerning all uncleanness, "Let it not be once named
   among you, as becomes saints, for it is a shame to even speak of those
   things which are done of them in secret." It is defiling to the mind of
   the Christian to even speak about some of his old ways.

   "Oh," says one, "you are a very rigid Puritan!" I am and in this age we
   need a great deal more than we have of rigid Puritanism! We are to hate
   even the garment spotted by the flesh! Years ago, when they dug into a
   disused pit in a village, they took up some old rags and, as a
   consequence, nearly all the people in that village died of the plague.
   They did not know what was in the old rags buried in the pit. We are
   afraid of the old rags of sin--we do not like digging them up! I
   believe that some of you, who used to drink, had better go seven miles
   round rather than pass some public house doors where you formerly went.
   Some of you cannot do without awful peril what other people might very
   freely do because there is a special temptation for you about that
   particular form of evil. You must not even mention the names of the
   sins, for there grows up in a man who has been long used to sin, a
   passion for it, a passion against which he cannot readily guard
   himself. Stay away, stay away! Remember the old Jewish proverb about
   the Nazarite who had been pledged from his youth to drink no wine. The
   proverb says, "O Nazarite, go about, go about and walk not through the
   vineyard!" Keep as far as you can away from temptation!

   So, you see, when the Lord works this great change in us, He makes us
   to feel that we do not like to even mention the names of our old
   idols--we would put them away out of our mouths altogether.

   Yes, and God goes further than that, for He says that He will put away
   the very remembrance of them--"they shall no more be remembered."
   Augustine, before his conversion, had been in the habit of associating
   with a woman of vicious life. After his conversion, she passed him in
   the street and said to him, "Augustine, it is I," and he, as he could
   not go by without giving her some answer, replied, "Yes, but it is not
   I!" That is to say, "Augustine is now another Augustine. He can have no
   more to do with you, for he is a changed man, he forgets his old
   pursuits." This is what the Lord would have us do. If there is anything
   which has pleased you, but has grieved Him--if there is anything that
   has defiled you, then if you have been washed with the blood of your
   dear Savior's heart--forget that sin! Be today as though you had never
   known it. Forget its sweetness and only remember the bitterness it
   brought to Him! Forget its charms as you would forget the azure scales
   of the serpent and remember only its sting, when it has stung you
   so--yes, and stung your Savior to the death! God help us in this, dear
   Friends, not to even remember the names of our old sins, or the sins
   themselves with any sort of love.

   Notice, also, that the Lord went still further than that, for He said.
   "/ will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the
   land." The prophets were to pass out of the land. "We have no prophets
   now," says one. But you know what these prophets did--they led the
   people to worship false gods. So, when God forgave His people, they
   sent these prophets packing. Have you any prophets of this sort? I will
   point out one. He will be outside the Tabernacle, tonight, to meet you.
   He will come to you and say, "Now, old Friend, come with me, and go to
   such-and-such a place." On the road he will speak to you in such a way
   as will drive out of you every impression you have received. It often
   happens that it is absolutely necessary to say--

   "My old companions, fare you well! I cannot go with you to Hell."

   There are connections that must be broken and the sooner you do it, and
   the more fully you do it, the better for you if there are false
   prophets who have led you astray--companions who have jested with you,
   or associates who have led you into vice--and the devil has many of
   these prophets who seem to be more industrious to damn men than we are
   to save them! They compass sea and land to make proselytes for
   infidelity and vice! You know the men and the women, too, and the
   diligence with which they pursue their evil calling. Come away from
   them! Come away from them--there are better companions to be found than
   these. I like to see the workman in the workshop, when he finds that he
   has to toil with ungodly men, keep himself to himself, or get with some
   others who are of his own way of thinking and acting--and not mixing
   with those who are engaged in evil pursuits.

   Perhaps there are some young persons here, tonight, who have just left
   that pretty country village and the old Baptist Meeting House where
   they have always gone since they were converted, and they are in London
   for the first time. Now, mind these false prophets that are about! You
   will find them everywhere--perhaps lads of your own age, or possibly
   old men, steeped up to their lips in filthiness--they will count it
   their pleasure to degrade and pollute you! Get away from them! Have
   nothing to do with them! Fly for your life, even if, like Joseph, you
   have to leave your cloak behind you! Away, away, away, if God has
   forgiven you. If not, get forgiveness now. Before you go out of this
   building, seek Jesus, that you may be washed in His precious blood, and
   then say to yourself, "Now I am the Lord's. The blood that has cleansed
   me has bought me. I am Christ's man and for Him I will live. I cannot,
   I will not, have idols! Neither will I hear nor even talk about them,
   or seem to have any connection with them. I am, if not in the common
   meaning of the term, yet spiritually, I am a Nonconformist. I will not
   be conformed to the world, but be separated from it, that I may be
   conformed to Christ and follow Him in holy ways in the midst of this
   evil generation."

   Look first to my Lord upon the Cross, and when you have looked until
   your sin is gone, then lift up your hands to Him and solemnly say, "My
   Lord Jesus, as You have died for me, I will live for You as You shall
   help me." Amen, so let it be, for Christ's sake!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM51; ZECHARIAH 12:10-14; 13:1-6.

   We will first read Psalm 51. If we need any music to this Psalm, we
   must have the liquid melody of tears, sighs, cries, entreaties. It is
   above all the others, the penitential Psalm. It is the Psalm of David
   when Nathan the Prophet came to him after he had committed his great
   sin with Bathsheba. Thus, David prayed--

   Psalm 51--Verses 1-3. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your
   loving kindness: according unto the multitude of Your tender mercies
   blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and
   cleanse me from my sin. For / acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin
   is ever before me. And there is no hope of pardon unless we do this! We
   must not try to cloak or hide our sin from God, but we must acknowledge
   our transgressions. Our sin must be always before us--a ghost that
   haunts us--a black cloud that hangs over us, which we greatly dread.

   4. Against You, You only, have / sinned, and done this evil in Your
   sight: that You might be justified when You speak, and be clear when
   You judge. Whatever God may say to us, however sharp it is, and
   whatever God may do to us, however terrible it is, we deserve it! And
   when we are in a penitential frame of mind, we feel that it is so.

   5-7. Behold, / was shaped in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
   conceive me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts: and in the
   hidden part You shall make me to know wisdom. Purge me with hyssop, and
   / shall be clean: wash me, and / shall be whiter than snow. David does
   not hope to wash himself! He does not trust in outward ceremonies--he
   appeals to God, the God against whom he has sinned--"Lord, cleanse me.
   You alone can do it."

   8. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which You have
   broken may rejoice. When God's Spirit deals with sinners, He does not
   play with them. A sense of sin is like the breaking of bones, but God,
   who breaks the bone, can heal it! He that takes away our joy, when we
   are under a sense of sin, can give us back that joy by a realization of
   pardon!

   9. Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. "And
   when You have done that, change my nature, that I may not sin again."

   10. 11. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
   within me. Cast me not away from Your Presence; and take not Your Holy
   Spirit from me. He might well be afraid that, after so foul a fall, so
   disgraceful a crime, God would cast him away, but he prays that it may
   not be so--"Cast me not away from Your Presence."

   12, 13. Restore unto me the joy of Your salvation; and uphold me with
   Your free spirit. Then will / teach transgressors Your ways; and
   sinners shall be converted unto You. "I will tell others what You have
   done. Your Free Grace, Your pardoning mercy shall not be hidden away in
   my breast, but I will begin to be a preacher of Your love. Yes, and I
   shall have converts, too, for the news of Your Grace to me shall draw
   others to you--'Sinners shall be converted unto You.'"

   14. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, God of my salvation: and
   my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness. He puts his finger on
   the sin. He might have said and, at one time he did say, that he did
   not kill Uriah the Hittite. Ah, but when he is right with God, he makes
   no pretences! He does not mince the matter, but he confesses the
   blood-guiltiness, for he was guilty of Uriah's death--"Deliver me from
   blood-guiltiness." Be honest with God. You will not receive pardon till
   you are. He can see through you--what is the use of attempting to hide
   anything from Him? Out with it, Man, that God may out with it, too!
   Confess it, that God's pardon covering your confession may cover all
   your sin.

   15-17. O Lord, open You my lips; and my mouth shall show forth Your
   praise. For You desire not sacrifice; else would / give it: You delight
   not in burnt offerings. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a
   broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise. Are you
   bringing this sacrifice to the Lord? Are there some in this House of
   Prayer who have greatly sinned and who are now greatly ashamed of
   themselves? Take heart of hope, poor Sinner, for God delights to accept
   a broken and contrite heart!

   18, 19. Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion: build You the walls of
   Jerusalem. Then shall You be pleased with the sacrifices of
   righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall
   they offer bullocks upon Your altar. Now turn to the prophecy of
   Zechariah, chapter 12, verse ten.

   Zechariah 12:10-14. And / will pour upon the house of David, and upon
   the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace and of supplications:
   and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they shall
   mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in
   bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. /n
   that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning
   of Hadad Rimmon in the valley of Megiddo. And the land shall mourn,
   every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their
   wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives
   apart; the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart;
   the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; all the families
   that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

   Zechariah 13:1, 2. /n that day there shall be a fountain opened to the
   house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
   uncleanness. And it shall come to pass in that day. How much God can
   crowd into a single day!

   2. Says the LORD of Hosts, that / will cut off the names of the idols
   out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also / will
   cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. God
   will not only destroy the idols, but He will cut off the very names of
   them out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered.

   3. And it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy, then his
   father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, You shall not
   live; for you speak lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and
   his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.
   It was a part of the Law of God in the Book of Deuteronomy that any man
   who professed to be a prophet and who sought to turn the people aside
   to the worship of idols, should be put to death. And it is here
   declared that when God had cleansed the land, there would be no false
   prophets! And if any man pretended to be a Prophet of the Lord when he
   was not sent of God, his own father and mother would be the first to
   execute judgment upon him!

   4. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be
   ashamed, every one, of his vision, when he has prophesied; neither
   shall they wear a rough garment to deceive. Imitating Elijah's garb,
   the false prophets hoped to win the attention of the people by the
   roughness of their dress. But all this would be dropped, for the people
   would be so well instructed that they would refuse to hear the false
   prophet.

   5. But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman, for man
   taught me to keep cattle from my youth. They shall be so ashamed of it
   that, to have kept cattle shall seem to be a far more noble employment
   than to have falsely set up to be a Prophet of the Lord!

   6. And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in your hands?
   "You wear the marks usually seen in God's servants--you have scarred
   yourself as His prophets were accustomed to do--you have, as it were,
   tattooed yourself with the name of your God. What does it all mean?"
   But he shall be so ashamed of it that--

   6. Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of
   my friends. He shall say anything rather than confess that he is a
   false prophet, he shall be so ashamed of himself! What a mercy it is
   when God makes men ashamed of sin, and when He makes them so ashamed of
   false doctrine that they cannot bear it and will not any longer
   proclaim it! Oh, that that day were already come!

Kept From Iniquity

   (No. 2432)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 29, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 22, 1887.

   "I kept myself from my iniquity." Psalm 18:23.

   In our reading we had a very wonderful description of God's delivering
   mercy towards His servant David. He was very peculiarly tried in the
   court of Saul. He deserved so much of the king that it was doubly
   difficult for David to be treated so badly. He had been the deliverer
   of his country when he slew Goliath, yet he was hunted as if he had
   been the grossest of malefactors. He had to flee for his life like a
   partridge upon the mountains--and all the while, no doubt-- Saul and
   his partisans accused him of all manner of evil. There was scarcely any
   bad thing which they did not attribute to David! But he was upright
   before God and he dared to challenge the investigation of the Most
   High, for he was sincere and true to the core. He proved by his conduct
   that he was so, for when Saul was in his hands, on two memorable
   occasions when he might readily have taken his life, he refused to do
   so. He would not put forth his hand against the Lord's anointed and, in
   great Grace, in his own good time, God was pleased to deliver His
   servant.

   If men blow out the candle of a Christian's reputation, God will light
   it again! If He does not do so in this life, remember that at the
   Resurrection there will be a resurrection of reputations as well as of
   bodies--"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom
   of their Father." It is, after all, of very small account what is said
   by men whose breath is in their nostrils. "They say. What do they say?
   Let them say." Let them say till they have done saying--it little
   matters what they say! Yet, to a sensitive spirit, like that of David,
   the tongue is a very sharp instrument--it cuts like a razor and
   pierces, even, to the bones. He felt, therefore, the slander of many,
   and was sometimes greatly troubled by it. However, God was pleased to
   work a very marvelous deliverance for him. It seemed as if the Lord
   would sooner shake the earth to atoms and crush the arches of Heaven
   than fail to deliver His servant! He will still do so, depend upon it!
   "He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved."

   David attributes his Providential deliverance to the mercy of God by
   which he had been kept clear in his conduct. "I kept myself from my
   iniquity." Whatever you do, if you do right, God will see you through,
   but, whoever you may be, if you turn aside to crooked ways, you will
   soon fall into a bog. If you try to carve for yourself, you will
   probably cut your fingers. He who thinks that he can do better by
   suppressing truth, or by speaking lies, or by acting contrary to the
   dictates of his conscience will find that he has made a great mistake.
   Trust so in God as to hold to your integrity. "Let your eyes look right
   on and let your eyelids look straight before you." Ponder the path of
   your feet and God will bring you through as surely as He is alive,
   which is saying much more than if I said as surely as you are alive,
   for, as the Lord lives, before whom we stand, He will not forsake the
   righteous, nor cast off them that serve Him faithfully!

   This is the passage we have to consider, "I kept myself from my
   iniquity." Here is, first, a personal danger--"my iniquity." And,
   secondly, here is a special guard--"I kept myself." And then, thirdly,
   here is a happy result. David could say, as he looked back upon his
   life, "I kept myself from my iniquity." There was no boasting in this
   declaration, but as his enemies accused him falsely, like an honest
   man, he defended himself, for he was truthfully able to say, "I kept
   myself from my iniquity."

   I. Well now, here is, first, A PERSONAL DANGER--"my iniquity."

   This is a dreadful possession to have in the house! A man had better
   have a cage of cobras than have an iniquity, yet we have, each of us,
   to deal at home with some special form of sin. It is said that there is
   a skeleton in every closet. I do not know whether that is true, but I
   do know that there is something very much allied to a skeleton, that
   is, the body of this death with which we all have to deal--and it takes
   a special shape in each good man. There is some particular sin which he
   may call "my iniquity." Not only is there the general iniquity which
   affects the whole race, but each man has his own particular form of
   it--"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, everyone, to
   his own way." There is a general sin, but there is a particularity in
   it, too--each man has his own way of sinning, so that he can speak of
   "my iniquity."

   Let us think of the particular form of iniquity with which some of us
   have to do. It takes its specialty, perhaps, from our natural
   constitution. He who judges all men alike does them an injustice. There
   are some who have but little tendency to a particular form of evil, but
   they have a very great inclination towards some other sin. Some are
   sanguine--they are expecting great things and they fall into the sin of
   expecting to drink sweet waters from the cisterns of this world. There
   are some of quite another temperament who are inclined to despondency,
   perhaps to suspicion--they may fall into mistrust, or various forms of
   unbelief and even into despair which will be very grievous to the God
   who is always gracious. There are some men who, from their very
   parentage, are inclined to drunkenness or to unchastity. There are
   others, favored by God with a godly ancestry, who, if they were left to
   themselves, would not probably fall into either of these forms of sin,
   yet they might be proud of their own integrity and proud of their own
   uprightness--and is not pride as great a sin as those more open
   transgressions? Depend on it, my dear Friend, you have some tendency,
   peculiar to yourself, and there is a special point where you lie open
   to the attacks of temptation! Happy will that man be who so knows
   himself that he sets a double watch against that postern gate through
   which the adversary is apt to creep in the dark. Peculiar constitutions
   may lead to special forms of sin and it behooves the godly man to keep
   himself from his own iniquity!

   Our tendency is to decry the particular form of sin that we find in
   others. We hold up our hands as if we were quite shocked. Better look
   in the mirror than look out the window! Looking out of the window you
   see one for whom you are not responsible, but looking in the mirror,
   you see one of whom you must give account to God--and you will do well
   to ask God to keep that one! You will, likely enough, within a day's
   march, not see a much worse man than he is, if you know him well. I
   remember Mr. Berridge's quaint joke. He had, hanging round his room,
   the portraits of many ministers and he would say to his friend, "Here
   is Whitefield, here is Wesley, here is So-and-So." And then, leading
   his visitor to a mirror, he would say, "Here is the devil." Yes, he is
   somewhere about there where you are looking. If you look long enough,
   you may detect some of his handiwork, at any rate, for there is
   something of his work about us all! Sin, therefore, may be something
   peculiar to constitution.

   But any man may also know that "my iniquity" may be engendered by
   education. How impressible we are in childhood! We bear the print of
   our mother's fingers when we are 50 years of age and it is not gone
   from us even when we are old and gray-headed. Things that were done at
   our father's home are likely to be done in our own home. Things that we
   saw, things that we heard when we were very young may abide with us and
   help to shape our whole life. May God help us so to look back upon our
   early training as to discover the defects of it and, not laying the sin
   upon others, which would be a wicked perversion of the truth, yet let
   us remember that as we lived in a sinful generation, we have acquired
   some taint from it and we have need to watch against the sins which
   were taught us when we were young, especially any of you who have been
   rescued by Grace out of homes of drunkenness and debauchery!

   I bless the Lord that there are many here who have been brought by
   Sovereign Grace out of very dens of iniquity! There are some here who
   are, so far as they are aware, the only ones of all their household who
   know the Lord--and when they go home tonight, it will be a great pain
   to them as they cross the threshold, to think how very different the
   atmosphere will be from that in the House of Prayer where they have
   worshipped. Well, my dear Brother or Sister, we sympathize with you in
   your trial and pray the Lord that you may carefully watch and that you
   may be kept from your iniquity.

   No doubt there are certain forms of iniquity which grow out of our
   particular condition. The young man has his iniquity--it is not the
   iniquity of the aged. The young man is tempted to sinful pleasure, the
   old man to covetousness. Each period of life has its own special snare.
   Pray, I beseech you, young people, middle-aged people, old people--pray
   the Lord that you may be kept from the peculiar iniquity of that part
   of life through which you are going! He who leaves the shores of
   England for Australia may ask the guardian care of God while yet the
   white cliffs of Albion have scarcely melted from his view! Let him ask
   God's blessing as he passes through the middle passage of the Suez
   Canal. And let him not forget to pray when the captain tells him that
   within a few days he will come in sight of the southern shore. No, all
   along, we need God's Grace!

   It is so with our condition of life as to our outward circumstances.
   The rich man has his temptations. Few know how great they are, or they
   would not be so eager after riches. It is as hard for a rich man to
   enter the Kingdom of Heaven as for a camel to go through the eye of a
   needle! It is a natural impossibility, for so many difficulties
   surround the possession of riches. But with God all things are
   possible! Yet the poor man will not find that he has a much larger hole
   to go through--his straitened circumstances will not materially help
   him. Agur did well to pray, "Give me neither poverty nor riches." There
   are peculiar trials in each condition and even the middle way between
   the two is not without its own special temptations so that, whether you
   have much or little, pray God that you may keep yourself from your
   iniquity.

   There are iniquities which come through prosperity. I have never yet
   prayed to God to preserve me in going up in a balloon, for I have never
   had any idea of entering one, but whenever you prosper very greatly,
   and especially when you prosper very quickly, you are much like a man
   going up in a balloon. If people knew the danger, they would send in
   prayers to the Monday night Prayer Meeting, asking that the Lord would
   have mercy upon the man who is greatly prospering, for there are very
   peculiar trials surrounding that condition! Oh, that men might be kept
   from that cleaving to the world and letting the Savior go which so
   often follows upon great success in life!

   But equally must he pray who is in adversity. Oh, the ills of
   adversity! The worst ill of all is the tendency to doubt God and to put
   forth your hand unto iniquity in order to remove the heavy load. Pray
   the Lord, you who are losing everything, that He will keep you from
   your iniquity! You need not pray, like Pharaoh, "Take away the frogs,"
   but pray like David, "Take away my iniquity." That is the prayer of the
   true child of God!

   I may be speaking to some who have great talents. Well, you have need
   to pray, "Lord, keep me from my iniquity," for great talent is a very
   dangerous thing for a man to possess, a charge which needs great Grace.
   And, if you have but one talent, your iniquity may be to wrap it in a
   napkin and hide it in the earth. There is a temptation in the one
   talent as well as in the five! Therefore, pray the Lord to keep you
   from that iniquity which is often the accompaniment of the particular
   condition in which you are found.

   Brothers, there are some of you who have need to pray this prayer in
   reference to your calling. I do not think that any calling is free from
   temptation, but there are some positions in which the temptation is
   very terrible. I need not go into those which surround many of you in
   trade, when everybody seems to, "cut the thing fine," as they say, and
   to cut the truth much finer than anything else--and say a great deal
   that is not true under the notion that, somehow or other, it will help
   business. If there are customs in your trade which all others follow
   and which you know to be wrong, do not adopt them! Say, "Lord, keep me
   from my iniquity." You need not begin to say, "Those grocers, those
   milk-dealers, those publicans all have their iniquities." Think about
   your own--quite enough iniquities may crowd into your shop without your
   thinking about the shops of other people. Pray the Lord that you may be
   kept from your iniquity.

   And, O Beloved, what iniquities there are which surround us all in
   daily life! Into what company can you go without being tempted? In this
   city, at the present time, the position of a Christian is very much
   like that of Lot in Sodom. I speak what I know! I do not exaggerate the
   conditions which surround the lives of some Christian working men and
   women who are not able to let their children go into our streets by
   reason of the filthiness of the language that they would hear. Even
   round about this House of Prayer is a very cauldron of iniquity, so
   that many say, "We cannot live there and we do not know where to live
   to keep our children out of the temptations which now surround them." I
   say not that one age is worse than another, but I do say that the
   peculiar trials of today should make Christians walk very near to God
   and, instead of loosening and relaxing the lines of our religious
   profession, let us tighten them as much as we can and seek to be
   thoroughly Nonconformist, not conforming to the world, to be out and
   out Dissenters, dissenting from the ways of this ungodly generation!

   Still, to help you to find out your iniquity, I will make one or two
   more remarks. It is likely to be that iniquity which you have most
   often fallen into in your previous life. What has been your toughest
   struggle? Against quickness of temper? Then, that is your iniquity.
   Doubt and mistrust? That is your iniquity. Has it been covetousness?
   Has it been slowness to forgive any who have offended you? Has it been
   gossiping and mixing untruth with your talk? That is your iniquity.
   Whatever it is which, up to now, has stained your life, that is
   probably the thing which will stain it again unless you watch and call
   in the power of the Holy Spirit for your protection! That sin which you
   find yourself readily committing,

   which you drift into without any effort, yes, which you drift into when
   you are making a great many efforts not to do it--that is your
   iniquity! That which you have returned to after having smarted for it.
   That which you have vowed you would never be guilty of again and which
   yet has, in a moment, like the bursting forth of some hidden spring of
   water, carried you away with a rush--that is your iniquity! Oh, how can
   you keep yourself from it unless God shall keep you? Cry unto the Most
   High to enable you to keep yourself from your iniquity! That is your
   iniquity which has overtaken you even after you have prayed against it
   and labored against it--that you have concluded that surely you will
   never do it again--and yet you have done it.

   Let me tell you one thing more--that which you do not like to hear
   condemned, that which you do not like the preacher to mention, that
   which makes you wriggle in your seat and feel, "I wish he would not say
   that, he is coming too closely home"--that is your iniquity! And if you
   can not bear that you wife should speak to you about it, or that your
   brother or your sister should give you a friendly word of advice
   concerning it--that which you are most loath to hear, probably has to
   do with your iniquity! We may often judge ourselves by this test. It is
   that which you are most loath to hear that you have most need to hear.
   Instead of being angry with him who points it out to you, you should be
   willing to pay him for doing it! When you go to your doctor and ask him
   to examine you--if he says, "There is something a little amiss with the
   heart, or with the lungs," do you knock him down? Do you get angry with
   him for telling you the truth? No, you give him his guinea and even
   thank him for imparting bad news! And should we not thank those who
   rebuke us and tell us of our faults? When God does not send you a
   faithful friend, I pray Him to send you an honest enemy who will deal
   straightly with you--and let you know where you weakness is, that you
   may then cry to God--"Lord, keep me from my iniquity."

   II. Now, secondly, in our text there is A SPECIAL GUARD--"I kept myself
   from my iniquity."

   Someone may perhaps say, "I have a special temptation, but I am going
   to set a guard against it." Let me ask you, first, who you are--are you
   a child of God? Have you passed from death unto life? If you say, "No,"
   I am not referring to you in this part of my subject. You must be born
   again, you must go by faith to Jesus Christ and ask for cleansing in
   His precious blood and renewal by the Holy Spirit. I am now talking to
   the child of God--the man or woman who has spiritual life. I speak to
   you, my dear Brothers and Sisters, because you can, by God's Grace,
   keep yourself from your iniquity. How are you to do it?

   Well, first, you must find out what it is. You must get a clear idea of
   your own iniquity. Ask the Lord to search you and try you, and know
   your ways. When you have found out what that iniquity is, then endeavor
   to get a due sense of its foulness and guilt in the sight of God. Ask
   the Lord to make you hate, most, that sin to which you are most
   inclined. Remember that you are a child of God--it ill becomes you to
   be friendly with any of the King's enemies! Remember that Christ has
   bought you--you belong to Him--you should not be the slave of any sin.
   You must not be such if the life of God is in you. The life of God in
   the soul hates sin! You cannot take pleasure in any sin if you are,
   indeed, a regenerate man or woman. Therefore, I say to you, seek to get
   a sight of the heinousness of your particular sin and the danger which
   attends it, that, as you have an extraordinary horror of it, you may
   set that over against your tendency to it.

   Then, be resolved in the power of the Holy Spirit that this particular
   sin shall be overcome. There is nothing like hanging it up by the neck,
   that very sin, I mean. Do not fire at sin indiscriminately, but, if you
   have one sin that is more to you than another, drag it out from the
   crowd and say, "You must die if no other does. I will hang you up in
   the face of the sun." Strive against your anger. Strive against your
   covetousness. Strive against your envy. Strive against your evil
   temper, your malice, if that is your fault, for there are some who are
   very slow to forgive. Strive against it till you get your foot upon its
   neck. "I cannot do it," says one. Why? The Lord has said that He will
   bruise Satan under our feet shortly! Surely if you are to have the
   devil under your feet, you can get all sin under your feet by God's
   help--and you must do it. It is a part of that work that must be worked
   in us to bring every thought into captivity to Divine Grace. You are
   not able to subdue the least sin apart from Christ, but, by the help of
   the Holy Spirit, there is nothing that can master you!

   I tell you that if you let any sin master you, you will be lost! If any
   sin should remain unconquered, you are ruined, for this is the way of
   salvation--the absolute conquest of every sin through the Grace of the
   Holy Spirit. It must be so with you before you can enter Heaven--and
   you are able to overcome it in the power of Jesus Christ! If you have
   an iniquity that more than another haunts you, then keep away from all
   that tempts you to it. Is there a house where your company is much
   liked, but where you are never able to come away without having fallen
   into sin? Keep away from that house! It is often one of the most
   essential things in young converts that they should quit the company in
   which they once sported. You may go into some company to do good, but
   mind that you are strong enough to resist the evil, for it does not
   always do for those who have but little strength to attempt to pull
   others out of the fire--they may be pulled into it themselves! No, come
   out from among them! Be you separate! Touch not the unclean thing! You
   have no business to be in that place where it becomes almost necessary
   that you should sin--that necessity should warn you not to go there!

   The true path of safety is to pray and believe against all sin. We
   conquer sin by faith in Christ! This is the axe that will cut down the
   upas tree--and there is no other that will do it. Believe in Jesus
   Christ, the Savior, who died for you, and then believe in Him as living
   again and willing to help you in every conflict against sin. Go, having
   Christ Crucified with you, and ask Him to crucify your sin and nail it
   up to His Cross. So you shall be helped to overcome, but there must be
   care, prayer, watchfulness, trust and continual looking up to the Lord
   for Grace. Only so can you say, "I kept myself from my iniquity."

   III. Thirdly, I conclude with A HAPPY RESULT.

   David says, "I kept myself from my iniquity." He does not say that he
   could not sin, but that he would not, and he did not. When a wicked man
   gets old, he may say, "I do not sin like those young people." No,
   because you cannot--it has been well said that there is many an old man
   who, if you could put young eyes in him, would look the same way as he
   used to do! That is not what we want--it is not the failure to commit a
   sin because your passions have grown colder, or your strength has left
   you--it is a change of heart that is needed. "I kept myself from my
   iniquity." That is, "Though it would try to tempt me, and did so, and I
   might have yielded to it, yet by the Grace of God I would not yield."

   I pray, my Brothers and Sisters, that if we live 10, 20, 30, or even 50
   more years, we may be able to say, without any boasting, but in deep
   humility before God, "By His great Grace, by trust in Jesus, I kept
   myself from my iniquity," because, if we do so, see what a blessing it
   will be to us, for it will be to us a reason for our being brought out
   of the trouble! If when you are in need, if when you are under
   temptation, God helps you to keep straight, you will come out all right
   at the last. What a number of stories I might tell here of young men
   who were great losers, at first, by being godly, but they kept
   themselves right--and they always had to thank God for it afterwards.

   I know, at this present moment, a personal friend who was a banker's
   clerk. On a certain day he was told to do something which he judged to
   be, speaking plainly, dishonest. He told the manager that he could not
   do it, whereupon he received a month's notice. It was a country bank
   and he was not sent about his business at once--and he had time to turn
   the matter over. He had a wife and children and when he went home, it
   was not easy to tell the wife that the excellent position that he held
   would be vacated within a short time. But he stood fast in his
   integrity. He said that he was sure God would bring him safely through
   and he never had even the slightest thought of doing other than he had
   said he would do.

   It was within twelve months that he obtained the position of manager
   for that very bank--and it belongs to him at this moment! He very
   speedily became a man in a much better position than he could have
   expected to have obtained simply from the fact that it had been proven
   that he could be trusted. It is not always so--some people have to be a
   long time under a cloud--but, in the long run, if you, as a child of
   God, will but stand fast, God will not let you be a loser. If He does,
   it shall be your glory to lose everything sooner than tarnish you
   character! You shall find it a greater joy to lose all things for
   Christ than it would be to gain the whole world by doing anything that
   was wrong! If you are able to say, "I kept myself from my iniquity,"
   then you shall also be able to say with David, "I will love You, O
   Lord, my strength. The Lord is my Rock, and my Fortress, and my
   Deliverer. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised."

   Next, if you act thus, it will be a triumph of Divine Grace. Brethren,
   we want to show the world what Grace can do, and every member of the
   Church ought to feel that he is put upon his behavior to prove what the
   Grace of God has done in him! What credit is brought to Christ by
   professed Christians who are so like worldlings that if you put them
   under a microscope, you could not tell the difference between them? If
   you can do what worldlings do, you shall go, at last, where worldlings
   go! If Grace does not make you to differ from them, it is not the Grace
   of God, it is all a sham. We ought to feel that Christ's honor is in
   danger by our ill behavior and so live that we can glorify our Father
   who is in Heaven by our good works, keeping ourselves from our
   iniquity.

   For again, this will be our best testimony to others. It is well to
   preach as I do, with my lips. But you can all preach with your feet and
   by your lives--and that is the most effective preaching! The preaching
   of holy lives is living preaching! The most effective ministry from a
   pulpit is that which is supported by godliness from the pew! God help
   you to do this!

   And, lastly, what a sweet peace this will give to your conscience!
   Though we know we are saved by Grace, hear this, you ungodly! There is
   no way of salvation for you, or for us, but by the Grace of God through
   Jesus Christ--yet when we are saved, the evidence to our own soul of
   that work of Grace upon our nature is very sweet when we can say, "I
   have kept myself from my iniquity." A well-spent life, a life that is
   pure, a life that has been consecrated to usefulness, a life in which
   there has not been a turning aside to the right hand or to the left,
   helps us to lie down with comfort upon our dying bed and bid farewell
   to all our dear ones and feel that we are leaving behind us the legacy
   of a gracious example in which we do not glory, but for which we give
   God the glory and thank and praise His holy name! Begin at the Cross--
   there is the source of your salvation! Then go and live like the living
   Savior. God help you to do so, for Christ's sake!

Heman's Sorrowful Psalm

   (No. 2433)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 6, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 25, 1887.

   "But unto You have I cried, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer
   come before You." Psalm 88:13.

   WHAT misery of soul some persons endure before they find peace with
   God! There is no need that it should be so with them--their anguish
   often arises from a mistake. The Gospel is very simple--it is
   just--"Believe and live." He that believes in the Lord Jesus Christ is
   not condemned--he at once receives pardon, passes from death unto
   life--and he shall never come into condemnation. But a very large
   number of persons will not go the straight road to Heaven. They cannot
   believe that it is the right road, so they get troubled in their
   thoughts--tumbled up and down in their minds--as John Bunyan puts it.
   They go staggering over dark mountains, stumbling and falling, wounding
   and bruising themselves, and it is a long time before they come out
   into the light and joy of peace in believing. I would recommend you
   young people, especially, to take the straight way to salvation by
   trusting in Jesus just as you are. You shall, by doing so, avoid the
   poor pilgrim's Slough of Despond and many other things that might
   trouble and burden you. But, as I know that many do go round about and
   so get troubled and perplexed, I am going to talk to them from these
   words of the Psalmist.

   This good man, Heman the Ezrahite, went by this rough roundabout road
   that some of you have taken, and thus he found himself in terrible
   places. He seems to have been brought about as low as a man can be
   brought, but all the while there was this fact in his favor--he
   continued praying. He did pray. He would pray. He could not be made to
   leave off praying! If, by some process or other, Satan could have
   dragged him from the Mercy Seat, he would have had the diabolical hope
   of his ultimate destruction. But as long as the man kept on his knees,
   repeating his earnest cry to God for mercy, it was not possible that he
   could be destroyed! I may now be addressing some who, in the depth of
   their trouble, have been praying to God. Not always with a brave,
   believing heart, but still, with intense sincerity and earnestness--and
   now it has come to this pass with them--the evil spirit says, "Do not
   pray any more. Give it up! It is of no use. God will never hear you."
   If that is your temptation, dear Friend, may the Holy Spirit come to
   your rescue while I talk familiarly with you in His name!

   First, from this Psalm, learn how to pray. Secondly, from the
   Psalmist's example, resolve to pray in your very worst case. After I
   have spoken upon these two points, I shall close by giving you some
   reasons why you will find it wise to thus pray.

   I. First, then, from this Psalm, LEARN HOW TO PRAY.

   A great many people make a mistake about what prayer really is. They
   seem to think that it consists in repeating a form of words, but it
   does not. The witch of old used to mutter certain phrases and she
   pretended that she worked great wonders by repeating such and such
   words backwards! But there was no real power about her words--it was
   sheer superstition to believe in her incantations. I pray you, beloved
   Friends, do not rely upon prayer as a kind of witchcraft, for it is
   nothing better than witchcraft to believe that the mere utterance of
   certain sacred words and phrases can have any appreciable effect either
   upon yourselves or upon God! Prayer is the longing of the soul to hold
   communion with the Most High, the desire of the heart to obtain
   blessings at His hands. James Montgomery happily described what real
   prayer is when he wrote--

   "Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, Uttered or unexpressed,

   The motion of a hidden fire, That trembles in the breast. Prayer is the
   burden of a sigh, The falling of a tear, The upward glancing of an eye,
   When none but God is near. Prayer is the simplest form of speech That
   infant lips can try! Prayer the most sublime strains that reach The
   Majesty on high! Prayer is the contrite sinners voice Returning from
   his ways While angels in their songs rejoice, And cry, 'Behold he
   prays!''"

   If you would pray aright, you will do wisely to copy the writer of this
   Psalm and, first, tell the Lord your case. In this Psalm, Heman makes a
   map of his life's history. He puts down all the dark places through
   which he has traveled. He mentions his sins, his sorrows, his hopes (if
   he had any), his fears, his woes and so on. Now, that is real
   prayer--laying your case before the Lord! Go to your chamber, shut your
   door and tell the Lord all about yourself! Do you lack words? Well
   then, use no words. Tell Him all simply by the movements of your
   thoughts, for God can read the thoughts of men. Act as if you, like
   Hezekiah, were opening a letter--and spread it out before the Lord.
   Hide nothing from Him! It is true that you cannot hide it, for He knows
   all about you. But, still, do not try to conceal anything from Your
   God. Tell Him about your life of sin. Tell Him of your vain attempts to
   make yourself better. Tell Him of your many failures. Tell Him of your
   false hopes. Tell Him of all your blunders and mistakes and then say,
   "Lord, I do not, even now, fully understand my own case, but You do. Do
   with me according to Your own wisdom and prudence, and save Your
   servant, I beseech You." That is the way to pray! This is how the
   Psalmist prayed. Try the same plan as soon as you get home. No, do not
   delay, but pray thus at once! Open your heart to God and spread your
   case before Him right now!

   Then, the next rule of prayer is, pray naturally. Note that the
   Psalmist says, "O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night
   before You." Children are very eloquent when they cry--you have no need
   to teach them the arts of oratory or of posturing when they really want
   a thing--they cry all over till they get it! That is truly the way to
   pray-- when you so want the blessing that your heart and your flesh cry
   out to the living God! You will not need to trouble about words. Your
   eyes shall aid you with their liquid pleas. Your breath shall assist
   you as you sigh and sob. Every part of your being shall help you as you
   stretch out your hands to God. The best prayer is like a cry--the most
   natural expression of the sorrow and the need of the heart. Come like
   that to God! Get upstairs into that little room where no eyes but the
   Lord's shall see you--and there cry to Him, "God be merciful to me, a
   sinner." That is the way to pray, not to repeat some pompous form which
   may have been useful to saints in ages gone by, but to let your very
   soul pour out itself like water before the Lord in the most natural way
   that it can find!

   But you must also notice, in the first verse, what is very essential to
   prayer. The Psalmist says that he cried day and night before God. This
   makes a wonderful difference in prayer! Praying is not whistling to the
   winds, it is crying before God--speaking to God! You cannot see Him,
   but He is there! Then tell Him your case. You cannot hear His footsteps
   to remind you of His Presence, but He is there, so ask for what you
   need--deal directly with God! Remember what Paul wrote to the
   Hebrews--"He that comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is
   a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him." Believe that God is and
   that He hears prayer, and you shall find it to be so in your own
   experience! I challenge any man to put this matter to the test and see
   if he does not find it as I say. There never was one, yet, who did come
   thus to God and God sent him away empty! Poor trembling Soul, get to
   your God! If up to now your prayers have been earnest, but you have
   left out this one important point that you have not really prayed to
   Him, then begin at once in a better style. You may write a hundred
   letters to a friend, but you will never receive an answer to them if
   you do not properly direct them and mail! So, many persons forget to
   direct and post their prayers by really presenting them before God.

   Next, dear Friends, this Psalm will help you in prayer if you read
   aright its first words--"O Lord God of my salvation." Pray with this
   belief fixed in your mind--that your help must come from God--and pray
   expecting salvation from the Lord. It is true, whether you know it or
   not, that you are lost--and that only God, Himself, can save you. Pray
   in the full belief of that fact. Go to God with this thought in your
   mind and this utterance out of your mouth--"O Lord, I am lost unless
   You help me! I am undone unless You come to my rescue! Here I am at
   your Mercy Seat, crying to You, Lord, save me." Do not go to so-called
   priests. Do not go to ministers or to Christian friends with any idea
   that they can help you the turn of an ounce! Go straight away to God,
   applying to Him through our Lord Jesus Christ, and it is not possible
   that He will turn you away! Try it and see. Some of us who were
   certainly as guilty as ever you can be, have tried this plan and we
   have found mercy and we are, therefore, all the more earnest in
   entreating you and all other sinners to do the same!

   Further, dear Friends, that you may pray aright, notice that the
   Psalmist prayed often. In the first verse he says, "I have cried day
   and night before You." Further on he says, "I have called daily upon
   You." I like those morning prayers of which our text speaks--"In the
   morning shall my prayer come before You." I remember, as a lad, when I
   was seeking the Savior, getting up with the sun that I might get time
   to read gracious books and to seek the Lord. When I look back upon it,
   I can see why the Word was blessed to me when I heard the Gospel
   preached in that Methodist Chapel at Colchester, because I had, before
   that, been up many times crying to God for the blessing! There are some
   people here who do not know what it is like early in the morning. You
   never did, in your lives, see the sunrise, did you, unless you got up
   earlier than usual one winter's morning? I have often proved that the
   early morning is the best part of the day. The dew of the morning has
   medicine in it to drive away many a disease. A little while, all alone
   in the morning, might prove to be the time in which God would meet with
   you--will you not try it?

   But the Psalmist says that he also prayed at night. Perhaps, when
   others were asleep, he stole from his couch and bowed His knee, and
   cried to God. When all is hushed and still--and there is, even in
   London, an hour of that kind, somewhere between three and four o'clock
   in the morning when the streets cease, for a while, their almost
   perpetual grind and the air is still and quiet--it is wonderful how you
   may be helped to pray by the silence that is round about you! O Friend,
   if you are not saved, I would beseech you to get up at the dead of
   night and cry to God for salvation! I would advise you not to go to
   your beds, nor to think of falling asleep till you have believed in
   Jesus to the saving of your soul lest you should never wake up in this
   world, but should awake in that state in which there is no hope,
   forever, for those who have died impenitent! Dear Hearts, cry often,
   cry continually to God until He gives you this salvation! And after
   that I know you will always cry to Him, for you will not be able to
   help it! Prayer will become your daily breath and you will pray, then,
   as naturally as your lungs now heave with the breath of life! But pray
   often, even as Heman did.

   The Psalmist tells us, also, that he prayed with weeping and mourning.
   Read verse nine--"My eyes mourns by reason of affliction: Lord, I have
   called daily upon You." That is a blessed style of praying, when the
   prayers are salted with penitential tears! If your heart is breaking
   with repentance and sorrow for sin, you will break down the bars which
   shut you out of hope and peace! If you will give up your sin. If you
   mourn over your sin. If you sigh and cry to become gracious and holy,
   you shall prevail before long, for God may permit a weeping penitent to
   stand awhile at mercy's door, but He can never send that penitent away
   empty, for it is written over that door (I can read the golden
   letters)--"He that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." While God
   lives, never shall a sinner truly come to Him and yet be cast out! I
   say again, go and try it, go and try it, and you shall find it to be
   so!

   Once more, you will perhaps find prayer more successful if you follow
   the Psalmist's way of praying pleadingly. Notice how he puts it in the
   10th verse--"Shall the dead arise and praise You?" Plead with God! If
   you are in earnest, you will soon find pleas that you can use with Him.
   "Lord, save me! It will glorify Your Grace to save such a sinner as I
   am. Lord, save me, else I am lost to all eternity! Do not let me
   perish, Lord! Save me, O Lord, for Jesus died. By His agony and bloody
   sweat, by His Cross and passion, save me." I am going over the kind of
   pleas I used when I took my arguments and came before the Throne of
   Grace and said, "I will not go away, I will not quit the Mercy Seat
   except You bless me." Surely you can find some reason why you should be
   saved! Look not for it in any merit of your own, else you will look
   where you will never find it! But look to His Free Grace and Sovereign
   Love--to the heart of God and to the bleeding wounds of Jesus--and say
   to God, "Lord, I cannot, I will not, let You go except You bless me."
   If you pray in that fashion, it will not be long before the morning
   light of salvation will break in upon your troubled spirit!

   II. This leads me now, briefly, to speak upon my second division--from
   the Psalmist's example, RESOLVE TO PRAY IN YOUR VERY WORST CASE.

   I want to go over the Psalm, again, very rapidly, to remind you of the
   writer's experience. This man of God was, first, full of troubles. Note
   what he says in the third verse--"My soul is full of troubles." Yet he
   prayed! When you are full of troubles, go to God with them, that is the
   very time when you most need to pray. "But," you say, "Mr. Spurgeon,
   you do not know all that I have to think of." No, but I do know that
   the more you have to think of, the more reason you have to go to God in
   prayer about it. That was a grand argument of Martin Luther when he
   said to his friend, "I have a very busy day, today. I have so much work
   to do that I am afraid I shall not get through it all. I must have at
   least three hours' prayer, or else I shall not have time to get through
   all my toil." The more work he had to do, the more prayer he felt that
   he needed! Is not that right? The more loads you have to drag, the more
   horses you need--and the more work there is to be done, the more reason
   is there for crying to God to help you to do it! That is not a waste of
   time. On the contrary, it is the best employment of time that anyone
   can have!

   When you are full of trouble, pray the more. "Ah," says one, "I gave up
   praying, Sir, because I was in such trouble." Foolish brother! Foolish
   sister! Another says, "I went down in the world till I felt that I had
   not any clothes fit to come in." Clothes fit to come in? Any clothes
   are fit to come in if you have paid for them! "Oh!" says another, "but
   I was so troubled that I did not like to come." What? Not go to the
   House of the Lord when you most need comfort? That is the time when you
   ought certainly to come! Do not, I pray you, stay away from the outward
   means of Grace when you are in trouble! But especially do not stay away
   from God, Himself, when you are tried and perplexed. When you are as
   full of trouble as you can be, then is the time to pray the most!

   Next, it seems that the Psalmist was ready to die--"My life draws near
   unto the grave." Well, do not leave off praying because you are ready
   to die! Then, surely, is the time to pray more earnestly than ever--

   "Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, The Christian's native air!
   His watchword at the gates of death-- He enters Heaven with prayer." If
   you are going to die, die praying! Do not let the fear of death stop
   your praying, that would be folly, indeed!

   Moreover, the Psalmist had given himself up--"I am counted with them
   that go down into the pit." Well now, if you have given yourself up,
   yet still pray. I know that you say, "Sir, I am in despair." Well,
   offer one more prayer, Brother! One more prayer and if you should not
   get comfort, then, I will come to you and say, yet again, "One more
   prayer." If you despair of everything else, yet do not despair of the
   mercy of God! Your extremity will be the Lord's opportunity. Keep on
   praying! As long as you are out of Hell, still keep on praying, and so
   you shall never go there, for no praying soul can ever be cast away
   from the Presence of God. Keep on praying, I beseech you, even if worse
   comes to worse.

   I fancy that I hear you say, "Oh, but I have no strength left!" Well,
   then, you are just like Heman, with no strength, for he said, "I am as
   a man that has no strength." Pray all the more if that is your case. If
   you have not strength to kneel, fall flat on your face and pray to God,
   but keep at it, hold on to it! If you can scarcely hold on, yet somehow
   or other get a grip of the Divine promise and plead for God's mercy for
   the sake of Jesus--and you shall never perish!

   I do not know whether I am spreading my net widely enough, but there
   may be one who says, "/am forgotten'" Then listen to what Heman
   says--"I am like the slain that are in the grave, whom You remember no
   more: and they are cut off from Your hands." Man, if you have written
   yourself down as lost. If you have given up all prayer. If you never
   open you Bible. If you have resolved never again to come to the House
   of God because you despair of mercy, yet, I beseech you, know that it
   is a lie that deceives you! There is still hope for you! Believe that
   Jesus still receives sinners--yes, such sinners as you are--and go to
   Him by believing prayer and you shall yet find mercy! There are many
   records of men and women who have been in despair through guilt for 20
   years or even a longer period and then have been Divinely delivered!

   I remember one case, that of Mr. Timothy Rogers, who was 28 years in
   despair and yet came out to light and lib-erty--and wrote a wonderful
   book on trouble of mind which has been a comfort to many other
   afflicted souls. Do not despair even if Satan seems to have gripped you
   and to be dragging you down to the bottomless pit! As long as you yet
   live, the Gospel woos you and entreats you to believe in Jesus Christ,
   for there is yet room in the heart of God and in the love of God for
   such a sinner as you are! I pray you, do not cease to cry unto God!
   Still continue calling upon Him till He gives you a comforting answer!

   Perhaps you say, "/feel the wrath of God so heavily." What if you do?
   Go and plead the mercy of God in Christ and, as Christ, in the place of
   sinners, bore His Father's wrath, go and rest in that great vicarious
   Sacrifice! "But I have nobody to speak to," says another. Never mind if
   you have not--that is all the more reason why you should pray to God
   and plead with God who will not leave you. "But / am distracted," says
   another. Yes, and you will be distracted, and I should not wonder if
   you went out of your mind unless you go to God as you are, and implore
   Him to look at your distractions and to lay His gentle hand upon you
   and restore you to yourself--and then to restore you to Himself. I wish
   I knew how to plead with each one of you personally. I feel that I want
   to go down these stairs, and round these galleries, and to pick out men
   and women who are being tempted not to pray, again, and to give each of
   them a brotherly grip of the hand and to say, "Do not cease to plead
   for your life! Do not cease to look to Jesus on the Cross! Hope in Him!
   It is Satan's desire to ruin you by leading you to despair! Take heart
   of hope and believe that Mercy's gate is still open to you! Come, and
   welcome, and you shall in no wise be cast out."

   III. Now I finish with A FEW REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP ON PRAYING and
   why you should add to your prayer a simple confidence in our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ.

   This is the first reason. Suppose, dear Friend--and I do not like even
   to suppose such a thing--but, for the sake of argument, suppose that
   what your despair says is true--that you will perish? Then you cannot
   lose anything by prayer, can you? Remember what we sang a few minutes
   ago--

   "I can but perish if I go. I am resolved to try, For if I stay away, I
   know I must forever die."

   I repeat that you cannot lose anything by prayer. "Oh," I have said to
   myself, when broken down under a sense of sin, "God cannot be angry
   with me for crying to Him for mercy! Surely that cannot be an increase
   of my guilt--that I dare to say, 'Lord, forgive me.' The worst criminal
   before a judge may at least beg for mercy, so I will put in my plea--in
   broken words and with many tears. I cannot lose anything by praying
   and, therefore, I will certainly continue to pray unto the Lord."

   Moreover, dear Friends, it is not so great a thing, after all, to have
   to continue to ask. It is not so hard a thing for me to be made to wait
   a little while. As a sinner I kept God waiting for me long enough, yes,
   far too long! He called, but I would not come--what wonder if now He
   keeps me waiting? Shall I be in a pet and say, "I will wait no longer"?
   Oh, the many sermons I have heard and thrown on one side! Oh, the many
   times the Spirit of God has touched my conscience and I have resisted
   His strivings! Ought I, therefore, to be at all surprised if now He
   should say to me, "You must wait a bit at Mercy's gate, for I will have
   you knock, and knock, and knock again before I let you in"? Oh, no, it
   is not so hard a thing, and it will pay me for waiting! When He does
   but open the gate, I shall think very little of the many prayers and
   tears that I have offered to Him--I shall be so overjoyed to get inside
   that I shall bless Him for keeping me waiting! Therefore, my Soul,
   press on!

   Keep on praying, for what if He should, after all, hear you? O poor
   Heart, what if, after all, your sin should be forgiven you and you
   should become a child of God? O you forlorn one, what if the light of
   Heaven should yet shine in upon your heart and all the bells of holy
   joy should ring within your spirit? What if it should be so? And it
   will be so if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ! It may be that you
   are within an inch of salvation even now. Let me tell you, if you are
   but looking to Jesus, you already have salvation! One trustful glance
   at Him upon the Cross and you are saved, saved now, and saved forever!
   God grant that it may be so with you!

   At any rate, cease not to pray, for He to whom you pray is a gracious
   God. The widow who went to the unjust judge was importunate and
   prevailed with him, unjust as he was. But you are pleading with a
   loving God who gave His Son to die for sinners! Take good heart--you
   will not plead in vain, for He loves to hear your prayers. He must, He
   will answer you, for He is a God of Grace!

   Besides, if He does not save you, will He be a gainer by it? And if He
   does save you, will He be a loser by it? Oh, no, dear Heart! If He will
   save you, it will increase His honor and His Glory. Why, you yourself
   will tell everybody what a good God He is, will you not? And your
   friends and your neighbors, when they see you saved, such a sinner as
   you are, will begin to say to one another, "Here is a wonder of Grace!
   Look what God has done for this man. Let us come and seek Him, too." It
   is not to God's disadvantage to save you, now that Christ has died.
   Therefore, take heart and be of good courage.

   Moreover, He has heard others. He who speaks to you, now boldly tells
   you that God heard him. "I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and
   delivered me from all my fears! This poor man cried and the Lord heard
   him and saved him out of all his troubles." Come along with you,
   whoever you are. I am sure you can pray as well as I did when first I
   sought His face. I am sure you know about as much of the Gospel as I
   did when I first looked to Him, for I did not really know the Truth of
   God till I heard that word, "Look! Look! Look!" That is about all I
   know even now! I look at Jesus and He looks at me! I am looking to
   Jesus, and I am lightened of all my burden! That is the whole story.
   Look to Him and you shall be lightened, too! If others have been saved,
   why should you not be saved? Therefore, pluck up heart and still cry
   mightily and believingly to Him!

   More than that, the Lord has promised to hear you. Listen, "Call upon
   Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver you, and you shall glorify
   Me." Here is another precious promise, "Whoever shall call on the name
   of the Lord shall be saved." That is a big, "whoever"! Let me repeat
   that text. "Whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
   "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." The Lord does hear
   prayer! Do not let any unbelief upon that point linger any longer in
   your heart! He will hear you, now, sitting in your pew. Try it! Try it!
   If you have been praying for months and yet no peaceable answer has
   come to you, resolve this moment that you will never cease your
   entreaties until He grants you the desire of your heart!

   I am looking upon many young men and women here--how I wish that they
   would all look to Jesus even now! Oh, that at least some of you, dear
   young Friends, might begin to be Christians from this very hour! The
   harvest is past, the summer is well-near ended and you are not saved!
   Before the leaves fall from the trees, yield yourselves to Jesus! There
   are some boys and girls here--the Lord grant that they may, while they
   are yet children, trust in Jesus and be saved! But the most of you are
   men and women in middle life and many, very many of you, are aged
   people. Have you found Christ, dear Friend? Are there any of you old
   folks who are without Christ? I cannot make you out--gray-headed and
   yet unconverted? What is to become of you? In the order of nature, you
   must soon die. The young may die, but the old MUST. Oh, that you would
   not rest in your declining years till all is right for eternity! You
   know what accidents are constantly occurring and how suddenly men pass
   into eternity! A man has heart disease and without a moment's warning
   he is hurried before his Maker's bar! Prepare to meet your God and do
   so by believing in Him whom God has set forth to be the Savior of men,
   even the Lord Jesus Christ, who died, "the Just for the unjust, that He
   might bring us to God."

   God bless you, dear Hearers! We shall never, all of us, meet again on
   earth--that is not possible among these thousands from all quarters of
   the globe--but may the sincere penitent prayer of all the unsaved among
   us be so heard that we may all meet in Heaven! Amen and Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM88.

   A Song or Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon
   Mahaloth Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ez-rahite. I think that this is
   the darkest of all the Psalms--it has hardly a spot of light in it. The
   only bright words that I know of are in the first verse. The rest of
   the Psalm is very dark and very dreary. Why, then, am I going to read
   it? Because, it may be there is some poor heart, here, that is very
   heavy. You cannot proclaim of this great crowd how many sorrowing and
   burdened spirits there may be among us, but there may be a dozen or two
   of persons who are driven almost to despair. My dear Friend, if this is
   your case, I want you to know that somebody else has been just where
   you are. Remember how the shipwrecked man upon the lonely island all of
   a sudden came upon the footprints of another human being? So here, on
   the lone island of despondency, you shall be able to trace the
   footprints of another who has been there before you. Hear how he prays.

   Verse 1. O LORD God of my salvation, / have cried day and night before
   You. It was only a cry, a cry as of an animal in pain, or, at best, the
   cry as of a child that has lost its mother. "I have cried day and night
   before You."

   2. Let my prayer come before You. "Give me an audience, O Lord. Do not
   shut the door in my face. My prayer has been knocking, knocking,
   knocking, at Your gate! Open it. 'Let my prayer come before You.'"

   2. /ncline Your ear unto my cry. "Stoop down to me out of Heaven, O
   Lord. Bow that ear of Yours to hear even my feeble and unworthy cry. I
   know that I do not deserve it. I know that it will be a great act of
   condescension on Your part, but do 'incline Your ear unto my cry.'"

   3. For my soul is full of troubles. "Full of troubles, brimming over
   with grief, and every drop of it is as bitter as gall."

   3. 4. And my life draws near unto the grave. / am counted with them
   that go down into the pit. "They put me down as a dead man. They that
   see the lines of fierce despair upon my face reckon that I cannot live
   long. 'I am counted with them that go down into the pit.'" These were
   his pleas in crying unto God--

   "Distresses round me thicken, My life draws near the grave! Descend, O
   Lord, to quicken, Descend, my soul to save!"

   4. / am as a man that has no strength. Here is one, in the time of
   manhood, when he should be strongest, who yet says, "I am as a man that
   has no strength." This subject may not interest some of you, just now,
   but it is here, so we must mention it. And it may be needed even by
   you, one of these days. Bright eyes are not always bright and the
   earthly joy that leaps and dances does not abide forever! The day may
   come when you will turn to this Psalm with the two eights in it and
   find comfort in it because it describes your case, also.

   5. Free among the dead--A freeman of the sepulcher, at home at death's
   dark door. "Free among the dead,"

   5. Like the slain that lie in the grave whom You remember no more: and
   they are cut off from Your hand. This is, perhaps, the most awful depth
   of the whole Psalm. The writer bemoaned that he was not remembered,
   even, by God, any more, and that he was cut off from God's hand. At
   least, so he thought.

   6, 7. You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
   Your wrath lies hard upon me, and You have afflicted me with all Your
   waves. Selah. Very properly here comes a, "Selah." Such a strain upon
   the harp strings had put them all out of tune! So the players had
   notice to retune their harps and the singers were bid to lift up the
   strain of their song. It seems to me as if the writer, here, lifted his
   head above the waves of the tempestuous sea and still kept on swimming.

   8. You have put away my acquaintance far from me. You have made me an
   abomination unto them: / am shut up, and / cannot come forth. This is
   the utterance of a soul imprisoned in solitary confinement with nobody
   able to come to it to breathe out consolation. "You have put away my
   acquaintance far from me. They cannot come to me and I am shut up, and
   I cannot come forth to them."

   9. My eyes mourn by reason of affliction: LORD, / have called daily
   upon You, / have stretched out my hands unto You. Now hear how the
   Psalmist pleads with the Lord! Prayer is always best when it rises to
   pleading. The man who understands the sacred art of prayer becomes a
   special pleader with God!

   10. Will You show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise
   You? Selah. "Shall the dead arise and praise You?" Not in this life,
   though the godly will praise the Lord in the world to come. But now,
   when a Christian dies, God loses a chorister from the choirs of
   earth--there is one less to sing His praises here--and the Psalmist,
   therefore, pleads, "Lord, if I live, You can show Your wonders to me;
   but will You show Your wonders to the dead? If I am alive, I can praise
   You; but shall the dead arise and praise You?"

   11. 12. Shall Your loving kindness be declared in the grave? Or Your
   faithfulness in destruction? Shall Your wonders be known in the dark?
   And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? He pleads that if
   he dies, he shall not be able to proclaim the mercy of the Lord! God
   will lose a singer from His earthly choir, a witness from His earthly
   courts, a testi-fier of His loving kindness, faithfulness and
   righteousness.

   13. But unto You have / cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my
   prayer come before You. "I will be up before You come to me. I will be
   first to approach You. I will salute the rising sun with my rising
   prayer."

   14. LORD, why do You cast off my soul? Why do You hide Your face from
   me? Note again the earnestness of the Psalmist's pleadings. We have had
   many of them already--each verse has, I think, had at least two
   pleadings in it. If You would be heard by God, take care that you
   reason with Him and press your arguments with the Most High. He
   delights in this exercise of persevering supplication which will take
   no denial.

   15-18. / am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while / suffer
   Your terrors, / am distracted. Your fierce wrath goes over me. Your
   terrors have cut me off. They came round about me daily like water;
   they compassed me about together.

   Lover and friend have You put far from me and my acquaintance into
   darkness. There the Psalm ends. It is a sorrowful wail and it comes to
   a close when you do not expect it to finish. It really has no finish to
   it, as when men wind up their songs with proper finales--it is broken
   off like a lily snapped at the stalk. I have read you this 88th Psalm
   as an example of persevering prayer. The man who wrote it--"Heman the
   Ezrahite"--kept on praying even when he did not seem to be heard and
   thus he is a pattern to us. Yet notice how the next Psalm begins--"I
   will sing of the mercies of the Lord." It is not always the sorrowful
   sackbut that is to be in our hands--we can play the joyous harp as
   well! "I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever." "I will never
   leave off praising Him." "With my mouth will I make known Your
   faithfulness to all generations."

"A Man Under Authority"

   (No. 2434)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 13, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 2, 1887.

   "The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should
   come under my roof: but speak the word, only, and my servant shall be
   healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I
   say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes;
   and to my servant, Do this, and he does it." Matthew 8:8,9.

   WITHOUT any introduction, as we have just been reading Matthew's record
   of this notable miracle of our Lord, I shall come at once to the text
   and, first of all, work out the incident, itself, and then, secondly,
   make use of its lessons for our own practical purposes. There is much
   to be learned from this narrative for our guidance at the present time.

   I. First, then, let me WORK OUT THE INCIDENT, ITSELF.

   A centurion, the commander of the detachment of Roman forces then
   placed at Capernaum, had a servant exceedingly ill. He was paralyzed,
   or palsied, but it was with that kind of paralysis which still leaves
   room for great pain. He was grievously tormented and yet palsied. This
   man of war was evidently a good master, thoughtful of his servants, and
   when he heard that the great Prophet, Jesus of Nazareth, had come to
   town, he made the best of his way to Him and be-seeched Him to heal his
   servant. The centurion did not ask Jesus to come down and heal him, but
   the Savior at once replied, "I will come and heal him." This was more
   than the centurion had asked--he had pleaded for the healing of his
   slave--but he had not expected the personal Presence of the glorious
   Master!

   You remember that on another occasion, a certain nobleman went to Jesus
   and beseeched him, saying, "Sir, come down before my child dies." Jesus
   did not go down to the nobleman's child, but He sent His powerful Word
   and healed him.

   In this case, it was a servant, not a child, who was suffering and, as
   if the Savior would pay the greater attention where the rank was lower,
   He showed the condescension of His spirit by saying in this instance,
   "I will come and heal him. I, Myself, will come and undertake the cure
   that you request of Me." See how the Savior grants more than we ask and
   also how very tender and considerate He is to the poor and needy! He
   would not have them think that He despises them and, therefore, while
   to the nobleman's son a gracious word is sent, to the centurion's
   servant the Lord proffers a gracious visit--"I will come and heal him."
   Jesus is very tender and full of pity. He knows the soreness of human
   hearts in poverty and sickness and He will not inflict upon them any
   unnecessary wound. No, He will, as it were, go out of His way by a
   superior gentleness to those who are of the lowest rank, that He may
   show that He is no respecter of persons after the manner of men.

   Now, look what the centurion does. He had requested the Lord to heal
   his servant. He is very grateful for the kindness of the Savior in
   offering to come and heal him, but he is a true gentleman, so he will
   not put the Savior to any personal inconvenience. He feels that it is
   not at all necessary that the great Physician should take a journey to
   his house, so he says to Him, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should
   come under my roof; but speak the word, only, and my servant shall be
   healed." The refining power of faith upon the manners of men is very
   wonderful! Roman centurions were usually rough, bluff fellows who cared
   for nobody. On many a hard-fought field they received their training
   for future service and they forced their way up from the ranks, not by
   competitive examinations, but by blows, cuffs, bruises and wounds.

   Yet this officer, being a believer in Jesus Christ, is evidently
   softened--more or less civilized and cultivated by that very fact! You
   can notice it often, that the roughest men, the least educated of
   women, will have about them some of the most gentle and sweetest traits
   of character when they come to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. So the
   centurion says, "My Lord, glad enough would I be of a visit from Your
   august Majesty, but I am not worthy that You should come under my roof,
   and it is not necessary for You to do so. You can heal my servant with
   a single word. Therefore, I pray You, speak the word, only, and my
   servant shall be healed." It is this beautiful, thoughtful, gentlemanly
   feeling which I cannot too highly recommend, which led him to speak in
   this way--and what he said is remarkably instructive! Let me, then,
   work out the incident in detail.

   Notice, first, that the centurion drew a parallel between himself and
   the Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "I am a man under authority, having
   soldiers under me," or, as the Revised Version better renders it, "For
   I, also, am a man under authority." Some have tried to shift the
   meaning, here, and to teach that the centurion meant to say, "I am
   under authority, only a secondary officer, and yet I can do so-and-so.
   You are not under authority, but great and powerful and, therefore, you
   can do much more." But that is not the sense at all! The centurion
   meant that he was, himself, a man under authority, not merely a private
   individual, but a servant of Caesar! The uniform that he wore marked
   him out as belonging to one of the legions of the Roman empire! The
   insignia upon his uniform denoted that he was a centurion, a commander
   who derived his position and power from the great Emperor at Rome! He
   was "a man under authority."

   It is not to our great Master's dishonor, but quite the opposite, that
   this centurion meant to say, "I recognize in You, also, a Man under
   authority," for this blessed Christ of ours had come into the world
   commissioned by God. He was not here merely in His private capacity, as
   the Son of David, or as the Son of Mary, or even as the Son of God--He
   was here as the One whom the Father had chosen, anointed, qualified and
   sent to carry out a Divine commission! This officer could see about the
   Person of Christ the marks of His being commissioned by God. By some
   means, I know not how, he had arrived at this very safe and true
   conclusion, that Jesus Christ was acting under the authority of the
   great God who made Heaven and earth! And he looked at Him, therefore,
   under that aspect--as duly authorized and commissioned for His work.

   Now go a step further. He who is commissioned to perform any work is
   also provided by the superior authority with the power to carry out
   that work. A centurion, therefore, has soldiers under him. "I am a man
   under authority, having soldiers under me--men put under me for the
   carrying out of my commands--because my commands are authorized by the
   superior authority of Caesar." So this man seems to say to Christ, "I
   believe that You are provided with due assistance for the carrying out
   of all the purposes for which You have come into the world. If I have
   an order to send," he said, "I say to my servant, 'Go,' and he goes. If
   I want another to come, I say, 'Come,' and he comes. If there is
   something to be done, I summon one of the men under my authority and I
   say to him, 'Do this,' and he does it." He seems to say to the Savior,
   "You, also, commissioned and appointed of the great God, must have had
   servants appointed to wait upon You. You are not sent to a warfare at
   Your own charges. You are not left to do this work alone. There must
   be, somewhere about, though I perceive them not, soldiers under You,
   and servants under You who wait to do Your bidding." You catch that
   idea, do you not? The parallel is very clear and I do not wonder that
   the Savior greatly admired the man's faith which had enabled him to
   perceive this great Truth of God!

   The centurion went, therefore, a step further in his argument. "I, a
   man duly commissioned, have under me servants to carry out my will, and
   these servants of mine I keep well in hand." You know that there are
   masters who have servants to whom they say, "Go," and they do not go,
   or to whom they say, "Come," and they do not come--at least, they do
   not come very quickly! They must say, "Come," or, "Go," several times
   before the servants actually do come or go. And there are masters who
   may say, "Do this," and they may again say, "Do this," and they may
   yet, again, say, "Do this," but it is not done! But this centurion was
   a man who knew how to manage men. He was a master, a real master--not
   in name, only, but in fact. He did not, within his domain, tolerate
   anything like delay. He said to Christ, "I say, 'Go,' and they go, or,
   'Come,' and they come." He did not allow anything like mutiny or the
   resistance of his will. He had his whole household so well in hand that
   when he said to his servant, "Do this," he did it. This is the right
   kind of master and servants, in the long run, like a master who will be
   obeyed. The centurion was a disciplinarian of that sort, as kind as the
   sunlight, for he sought Christ's aid for his sick servant, but also as
   true and firm as steel, so that, what he said was to be done, was to be
   done, and done at once!

   He transfers that characteristic to the Savior. He does not, he cannot,
   do Christ the discredit of supposing that He has not His household well
   in hand--that He has servants who dare to trifle with His
   commands--that there are agencies which have broken loose from beneath
   His rule and will go whichever way they please. "No," he says, "Savior,
   commissioned of the Father, You have Your soldiers and Your servants,
   and I believe that You have them under such control and subject to such
   discipline that You have but to speak, and the act You order is done,
   or to command, and it stands fast forever." I trust that none of us
   would dishonor the Savior by questioning the Truth of this parallel
   which the centurion so thoughtfully drew.

   Once more, the centurion went a little further and implied that, as
   Christ had the power to perform the Divine Will and had that power well
   in hand, he believed He was willing to direct all that power to the one
   objective of healing his servant. I believe that many of you know that
   the Lord Jesus Christ is Almighty. You do not doubt that fact, but the
   question is--Is He Almighty to save you? You do not doubt that, if the
   Savior wills it, He can make your spirit whole, but you ask--Will He
   will it? Will He turn that power in our direction? It does not enter
   into the centurion's head that there will be any difficulty in his
   case. "No," he seems to say, "King of Kings, Omnipotent Master and
   Lord, You can, at once, direct an angel to fly to my servant, or You
   can bid the disease quit my dwelling, or You can speak to the palsy and
   the palsy, itself, will be Your servant and will fly away at once at
   Your command. You have only to put forth Your power upon my servant and
   he will at once be healed."

   I want you to believe, dear Hearts, that our Lord Jesus Christ, no
   longer here in the flesh, but risen from the dead, is clothed with
   power equal to that which He had in the centurion's day! No, that He is
   clothed with even greater power, for after His Resurrection He said,
   "All power is given to Me in Heaven and in earth." And then I want you
   to believe that He is prepared to turn all that power in your direction
   so as to work for your deliverance from spiritual death, your rescue
   from the power of sin, your help in the way of Providence, your
   guidance in the way of wisdom, or whatever, out of ten thousand things,
   may happen to be the need of this present moment! Oh, that He, who gave
   such faith as this to the centurion at Capernaum, would give like
   precious faith to many of you, that you, also, may glorify and bless
   His holy name!

   Now observe that there was only one further thing which was on this
   centurion's mind, and that was this. He looked upon Christ as a Master
   over all kinds of powers, powers sufficient for all His purposes. He
   looked at Him as having them all well in hand, so that He could have
   His own bidding done in a moment, and he was anxious to keep his own
   place. You ask me how I know this. I am sure it was so because, when
   the Savior was willing to come down to his house, he shrank from having
   such an honor conferred upon him! He seemed to feel that he was being
   put into a wrong position. He was, himself, only a servant, and he felt
   that, in the particular character which he was then bearing, he was not
   worthy that his master should come under his roof. So he said, "Speak
   the word only, and my servant shall be healed."

   I think that this is the principal thing you and I have to do. When we
   think about our Lord Jesus Christ, we need not worry ourselves about
   how He will effect His purposes--how the decrees of God will be carried
   out, or how His promises will be fulfilled. The principal thing we have
   to do is this--to be, ourselves, the Lord's servants. And when He says
   to any of us, "Go," to mind that we go, and when He says, "Come," to
   see that we come, and when He says, "Do this," to be sure that we do
   it! You would rule the seas? You had better rule yourself. You would
   purge the Church? You had better see to it that your own heart is
   purged! You would reform the world? Out with you! What have you to do
   with reforming the world till you have first washed your own hands in
   innocence? Get to your right place and do your own work and it shall be
   well with you. What are you, after all, but as a tiny worker on a
   little anthill? You have your one grain of wheat to carry and that is
   enough for you--do not worry yourself about all the concerns of the
   anthill! If you do, at least do not fret yourself about the whole
   planet on which you live, still less about the complete solar system,
   for what can you do with it if you worry you poor antship even unto
   death? No, but do your little share of work upon your own anthill!
   Carry your own grain of wheat to the general store so you shall have
   answered the purpose of your being and it shall be well with you. May
   God, even our Lord Jesus Christ, give us the Grace to set Him up very
   high as Lord and Master, full of power, wisdom and love--and then to
   set ourselves down very low and to ask that, as His servants, we may
   serve Him faithfully all the days of our life!

   Thus I have, as best I could, worked out the incident, itself.

   II. Now, secondly, I want to MAKE USE OF ITS LESSONS FOR OUR OWN
   PRACTICAL PURPOSES. First, then, dear Friends, it seems to me that this
   little narrative should be used to urge us to believe in the power of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, even if He does not speedily come in the Glory
   of the Second Advent. I am frequently talking with

   Christian friends about these evil days in which we live and of the
   mischief of the times in which our lot is cast. Certainly, it is not a
   very cheering subject, and generally I find that friends wind up with
   some such remark as this--"Well, the comfort is that the Lord Jesus
   Christ will come very soon. The defections in the professing Church,
   the blasphemies of the world--are they not among the special tokens
   that the end is hastening on? When our Lord comes, then all these
   difficult problems will be solved and all that grieves us will come to
   an end." Yes, yes, all that I fully believe, and I look upon the Second
   glorious Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ as the brightest hope of His
   Church.

   But, still, do you not think that a more practical and a more
   God-honoring faith would say, without putting aside the blessed hope of
   the Second Advent, "Yet the Lord Jesus Christ can deal with the present
   evils of the Church and of the world without actually coming into our
   midst." He can say a word while yet remaining in the highest heavens
   and the splendors of the sacred worship of the New Jerusalem! He can
   speak a word, there, and so effect His purpose here. Does not that
   Truth of God seem to flow naturally out of the faith of this centurion?
   Our blessed Lord, there is no need that You should, at present, rend
   the heavens and, in majesty, come down! There is no need that You
   should literally touch the hills and make them smoke, and that the
   glory of Your Divine Presence should consume Your adversaries! If it so
   pleases You, You can do Your bidding where You are, without disturbing
   this dispensation, without even working a miracle, allowing things to
   take their usual course and yet accomplishing Your supreme purposes!

   Beloved, I want you to exercise this faith continually. You are,
   perhaps, in a little Church, and when that goes to the bad, you say,
   "Oh, well, we cannot make it better! We must wait till the Lord comes."
   Not a bit of it! Begin to stir up His strength now, for He can work
   before that Second Advent, and work right gloriously, too! You turn
   over the newspaper, and you say, "I am weary and well near sick unto
   death of all this evil." Yes, and so am I, but what then? "Oh," you
   answer, "we had better go upstairs to bed and wait till the Lord
   comes." Not at all! Let us go and sharpen our swords and attack the
   enemies of our Lord more earnestly than ever! We will yet have another
   battle or two before He comes! Who knows how long He may tarry?

   But, whether He tarries or whether He comes soon, let us not be at all
   disquieted, as though His power could not be seen apart from His Second
   Advent! The power is given to Him in Heaven and in earth. Even now the
   name of Jesus is "high over all." He is now the great attraction to
   men, the great destroyer of Satan! Let us not begin, then, to think
   little of our absent Lord's present power, and to hang all our hopes
   upon His literal Presence among us! I say, again, that I am not
   depreciating that glorious coming of His--God forbid that I should do
   so! It is still our grandest hope! But let us not put it out of its
   place so as to make us at all despondent or distrustful about what our
   risen Lord is able to do for us even now! He can still do "exceeding
   abundantly above all that we ask or think."

   I want you, next, dear Friends, to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ's
   unseen servants. You look around, or you look abroad and try to find
   men who shall proclaim the Gospel vigorously during the next 20
   years--and you say you cannot perceive them. No, nor do I. Now think a
   moment--when this centurion saw Jesus of Nazareth standing in the midst
   of His disciples, what did he see? He saw a lowly-looking Man--in
   appearance very much like other men, but certainly not attended by any
   court, or guarded by any soldiers! Yet he believed, concerning this
   Man, that He was surrounded by invisible bands who, in a moment, would
   do His bidding! I want you to think thus of your Lord. At this day, the
   Christ of God on earth is attended by all the servants that He needs
   for His great cause. The scoffers say, "Ah, the old Truth is dying out!
   Where can they find men of mind to preach it?" But our eyes,
   enlightened by faith, can see a great multitude who shall publish the
   same old Truth of God until Christ shall come! The mountain is full of
   horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha--there shall yet be
   found myriads of burning spirits to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ
   until He comes again!

   I like that couplet--

   "Remember that Omnipotence Has servants everywhere."

   You cannot see them, but they are waiting for their Lord's orders, and
   He can see them! He knows where He has put them and when He will call
   them to Himself and bid them do His work! Therefore, let us not be in
   the least disheartened or discouraged because of what we see, or what
   we do not see. Let us rely upon the invisible--let us expect the
   unexpected! Yes, I meant to say, let us expect the unexpected. That
   which we cannot dream of as possible or probable, let us, nevertheless,
   believe shall be done, for God must be true, Christ cannot be defeated,
   Calvary never will and never can become, in any measure, a defeat! The
   death of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, must accomplish the purposes for
   which it was worked out. Let us rest assured, then, that He has His
   servants waiting to do His bidding.

   Now apply this subject a little more closely. I wish that some poor
   soul would even now believe that the Lord Jesus Christ could save him
   at once with a single word. I know you are apt to think that the
   conversion of men must be worked in some very particular and special
   way. Pictorial and descriptive accounts of striking conversions have
   been repeated so often that many people get the idea that the scenery
   is necessary to the effect! But I want you to put all such ideas away
   from your thoughts. If you needed any scenery, it is here before your
   eyes, but you do not need it. Otherwise, for a preacher to stand in
   this dense heat in the midst of 6,000 immortal souls is scenery enough
   for anyone who needs something striking! And if the Lord shall come to
   you and in a moment save you, there will be quite enough of the special
   and the particular in the mere fact that you are the subject of the
   Lord's mighty working! But I want you to believe that this work of
   Divine Grace upon the soul has not to do with any particular position
   in which a man is found. The Lord Jesus Christ can save a man when he
   is in bed, when he is putting on his clothes, when he is walking the
   street, when he is at his business, or when he is not at his business,
   but indulging in sin! I could give many instances to show that there is
   nothing needed in the way of peculiarity of position in order for
   Christ to save.

   When you are at home, you say to your servant, "Mary, go to such and
   such a place," and Mary goes. Or you say, "Sarah, come here," and Sarah
   comes. If there is anything to be done, you say, "Jane, do this," and
   she does it. Yet you do not put a paragraph in the newspaper saying,
   "Here, on the second day of October, 1887, Jane So-and-So made a cup of
   tea for her mistress." It is such a usual and ordinary thing in context
   with the duties of the household, is it not? Very well, just so is the
   work of conversion in context with the Church of Christ! Jesus,
   Himself, has but to speak the word and the great work is straightway
   done! The surroundings of the sinner do not matter at all to Him. He
   can now, under the present circumstances in which you are, come to you
   and pluck you out of death into life--out of darkness into light! Out
   of all your wanderings He can bring you home at once. If you truly
   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you are born of God. If you now, at
   this very moment, trust Christ with your soul, you have passed from
   death unto life! If, at this instant, you will have done with every
   other hope and just come and rest yourself upon the finished work of
   Jesus Christ, the Savior, you, John, Thomas, Mary, Jane, Sarah--whoever
   you may be--you are saved! I put it in a very homely way just now,
   intentionally, for I want to bring it down to this point--that, just as
   the centurion said, "I have only to say to my servant, 'Do this,' and
   he does it," so has Christ only to speak the effectual word of His
   Grace, and the devil will fly, sin will be removed, Grace will be
   infused and the soul will be saved! Oh, what a mercy this is!

   To you who are the people of God I would apply this subject in this
   way. If it is as I have said concerning the sinner, that he must trust
   in Christ if he is to be saved, it is also true that you should believe
   for your servants, your friends and your acquaintances. Your children
   are still unconverted--have you ever prayed for them, believing in the
   power of Jesus Christ to convert them? One said, the other day, of a
   certain person, "It seems no use praying for such a fellow as that." Of
   course it is no use to pray such prayers as you would be likely to
   present if you talk like that! When you have given a person up, and you
   have no further hope concerning him, what prayer can you offer for him?
   I want you, my Brother, my Sister, to believe, concerning your child,
   your brother, your friend, your unconverted neighbor, just as this
   centurion believed concerning his sick servant--that Jesus had but to
   speak the word and his sick servant would be healed!

   "Oh, but the doctor says that this is a case of paralysis! He says that
   he will never get over it. It is impossible for him to be cured--the
   disease is complicated in such a peculiar way that we must give up all
   hope." Ah, but this centurion does not look at the patient! He looks at
   the Physician! and he says, and says rightly, "Jesus can as easily bid
   this disease depart as I can bid my servant go when I wish him to start
   upon an errand." Think not of the sinner, or of the greatness of his
   sin, but think of the greatness of the Savior! I am sure that if we
   preached with more faith in Christ, we would see more results. Perhaps
   you do not see conversions in your work because you keep looking to the
   people--looking to the sinners--looking to the hardness of their
   hearts. What has all that to do with Christ's power to save? If this
   man, in addition to being paralyzed, could have had fever, leprosy,
   dropsy and all other diseases at once, it would not have mattered in
   the least to the great Physician, for when Christ comes on the scene,
   if you have one impossibility, He can meet it, and if you have 50
   impossibilities, He can meet them all just as easily! Granted an
   Almighty Savior, what room is there for doubt as to what He can do?

   I wish I could drive this Truth of God home into some who have been
   praying for others, but who have never prayed the prayer offaith. It is
   the prayer offaith that saves the sick! It is the prayer of faith that
   saves the sinful! It is the prayer of faith that makes everything of
   Christ and takes Him at His right valuation as being a Master of every
   situation! That is what you should do--make Jesus Christ Master of the
   situation and plead with Him in that capacity, and you shall not plead
   in vain, and your child, your friend, your servant shall yet be saved.

   Let the practical close of this evening's meditation be that we believe
   in Jesus a great deal more than we have ever believed before. If we
   have believed in Jesus, let us have still more confidence in Him. I
   think it is a sad pity when a man preaches the Gospel with a doubt at
   the back of his throat. What good can come of his preaching? They
   sometimes charge us with dogmatism. We would be more dogmatic if we
   could be, for we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen! And
   if men receive not our witness, we cannot help that. We cannot change
   our witness because men do not care to receive it! Go forth, minister
   of God, and preach the Gospel as a certainty--and you shall prove it to
   be a certainty! If you preach it as a something which may or may not be
   true, it will paralyze you--and it will not profit your hearers! In the
   name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I claim from every man to whom I
   preach that he should believe in Him, accept His great salvation and
   bow before Him! If you do so, dear Friends, you shall be saved! But if
   you will not, it is not left as a matter of choice with you--the Lord
   Jesus has, Himself, declared, "He that believes not shall be damned."
   He will not allow us to trifle with Him! He is a Sovereign, He is the
   King of Kings, and Lord of lords and He calls upon us to kiss His feet,
   bow down before Him and acknowledge Him as our Lord and God!

   Our chief business just now is not so much to think of what Christ can
   do in the great battle of the present, or what He will do in the dread
   conflict of the future, but of what we have to do, and I think that
   what we have to do is to so believe in Christ as to be His obedient
   servants. If He says, "Go," let us go! If He says, "Come unto Me, all
   you that labor and are heavy laden," let us come unto Him! If He says
   concerning any service, "Do this," let us do it! And if, instead of
   bidding us do anything, He bids us believe Him, let us come and believe
   Him--for this will be our wisdom, this will be our happiness, this will
   be our Heaven--to be the obedient servants of Him who must be Ruler
   over all! God has decreed that this shall be His Glory--He set Him on
   His Throne expecting till His foes be made His footstool. If you choose
   to be His enemies, you shall choose it to your own destruction! But if
   you will come and bow before Him and be His servants, you shall find
   that Heaven and earth are waiting at His back to bless you--and you
   shall go from strength to strength beneath His loving and unfailing
   care!

   The Lord bless you, dear Friends, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 8:1-27.

   Verses 1, 2. When He was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
   followed Him. And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped Him. Great
   multitudes often count for nothing--it is, here or there, one who is
   the notable individual. There may be a great company come up outwardly
   to worship, but it is the soul that comes into contact with Christ that
   is the most worthy of observation. There is no, "Behold!" when the
   great multitudes are mentioned by Matthew. But there is a, "Behold!"
   before the record of the leper coming to Christ--"Behold, there came a
   leper and worshipped Him." Let us all be of the leper's mind! Let us
   worship Christ! Surely we may do so, if only out of gratitude for
   having escaped from so dire a disease, but, inasmuch as, spiritually,
   by nature that disease is upon us, we have good reason to come to Jesus
   as the "leper came and worshipped Him"--

   2, 3. Saying, Lord, if You will, You can make me clean. And Jesus put
   forth His hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. And
   immediately his leprosy was cleansed. Come, then, to Christ, even
   though your faith is very incomplete! There may be, as there was with
   the leper, an, "if," about it, and an, "if," about a very vital point,
   namely, concerning the Master's willingness, but He will shut His eyes
   to that imperfection and only look at that part of your faith which is
   acceptable to Him, that is, your faith in His power. "You can make me
   clean," said the leper, and Christ dealt with him upon the terms of
   that, "You can." And as to the, "If You will," He blotted that out by
   saying, "I will; be you clean." So, sinner, come to Jesus, even though
   the doubting phrase, "If You will," shall still linger on your lips. If
   the leprosy shall show itself even there, in your unbelief as to
   Christ's willingness to cleanse you, yet come to Him and He will say to
   You, "I will; be you clean," and it shall be with you as it was with
   the leper--"immediately his leprosy was cleansed."

   4. And Jesus said unto him, See you tell no man. He will never say that
   to you or to me, but while He was here on earth, our Lord was very
   modest and retiring. He wished to conceal Himself as much as possible.
   He did not strive, nor cry, nor cause His voice to be heard in the
   streets. He sets us an example of what true power is, for true power
   does not flaunt itself before the eyes of men, or advertise itself at
   every corner of the street--it longs rather to conceal itself, being
   well aware that it will have all the publicity that is necessary--for
   such wonders cannot be hid.

   4. But go your way, show yourselfto the priest, and offer the gift that
   Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. The man was to make his
   cleansing known in the legal way. Our Lord Jesus Christ was very
   scrupulous to observe the Law while it still stood and we, also, should
   take care not to observe that ceremonialism which has passed away, but
   diligently to keep that which still is of Divine authority and of
   present force.

   5. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto Him a
   centurion. There came, doubtless, a great number of people when Jesus
   entered into Capernaum, but Matthew does not mention them. Yet he does
   say, "There came unto Him a centurion." Notice how these individuals
   are brought out by the Scriptural narrative--"a leper"--"a centurion."
   May there not also be some here who will come to Jesus and prove in
   their own persons, or in the persons of others for whom they shall
   pray, His power to bless and save? The Lord grant it!

   5-8. Beseeching Him, and saying, Lord, my servant lies at home sick of
   the palsy, grievously tormented. And Jesus said unto him, I will come
   and heal him. The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy
   that You should come under my roof. What a blessed thing it is to have
   that sense of unworthiness! Some are very flippant in the expression of
   their piety. After they have heard half-a-dozen sermons, they attain to
   perfect holiness! I wish that they were half as deeply humbled and knew
   half as much of themselves as this centurion did! "Lord, I am not
   worthy." That is a good lesson for anyone to learn. Still, when we can
   say, "Lord, we are not worthy," do not let us, therefore, think that
   Christ may not come to us. Let us ask Him to come whatever we may be,
   for our lack of worthiness must not stint or limit the condescension of
   our Divine Master. However, in this case, albeit that the centurion
   seemed almost to decline the privilege of having Christ come under his
   roof, yet he gave to Jesus high honor by believing in the power of His
   word even without His Presence

   8, 9. But speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For l am
   a man under authority. He was, therefore, only a subordinate officer,
   for he was subject to his superiors.

   9. Having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes;
   and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he
   does it. He left the Savior to infer what he meant, namely, that
   Christ, who acted under the authority of God, could readily speak to
   palsies and fevers, and say to them, "Go," and they would go just as
   quickly as a soldier would obey his officer's command. Brother, you are
   a Christian and you have known the Lord for 20 years--have you as much
   faith as this Roman centurion had? Do you believe that your Master's
   word can remove sickness, that He can clear difficulties, that He can
   supply needs, that He can break bonds, that He can send, by whichever
   angel or man He chooses, whatever blessing He pleases? Oh, that we did
   all believe as truly as this man did!

   10-12. When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to them that
   followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no,
   not in Israel. And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east
   and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the
   Kingdom of Heaven. But the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out
   into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Some
   of the rank outsiders shall be brought in by rich mercy, while others,
   piously trained, nursed at the very gates of the Church, shall,
   nevertheless, for lack of faith in Christ, be utterly cast away!

   13. And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go your way; and as you have
   believed, so be it done unto you. And his servant was healed in the
   same hour. Oh, pray for your friends, pray for your children, pray for
   your servants! And if you have faith like that of the centurion,
   according to your faith, so shall it be done unto you!

   14, 15. And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's
   mother lying sick of a fever. And He touched her hand, and the fever
   left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. Peter had a wife,
   you see. Romanists say that he was the first "pope," therefore the
   first pope had a wife and, mark you, if other popes had had wives,
   there would not have been any declaration of "infallibility," for there
   is no man who will believe himself to be infallible if he has someone
   near enough to remind him that he is not! But one evil usually goes
   with another--so it is recorded here that Peter had a wife as a kind of
   incidental rebuke of the sin of compulsory celibacy that was yet to be
   committed by priests and "popes"!

   16. When the evening was come, they brought unto Him many that were
   possessed with devils: and He cast out the spirits with His word, and
   healed all that were sick. Was not that centurion a kind of prophet? He
   had not long spoken about Christ's command over this man and that
   before Christ had an opportunity of putting His words to the test,
   Jesus cast out devils, and cast out sicknesses--

   17. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet,
   saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses. That is
   an amazing quotation and it teaches us that Christ has power to heal
   because He "Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses." Am
   I not to understand, from the context, here, that Jesus Christ's power
   is to be seen in His suffering, in His humiliation and especially in
   His wounds and in His death? He would have had no power to meet our
   maladies if He had not, Himself been compassed with infirmities for our
   sake! O blessed Master, You teach us where power lies--not in grandeur,
   but in self-sacrifice! Not in personal glory, but in personal
   humiliation!

   18-24. Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave
   commandment to depart unto the other side. And a certain scribe came
   and said unto Him, Master, I will follow You wherever You go. And Jesus
   said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
   nests; but the Son of Man has not where to lay His head. And another of
   His disciples said unto Him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my
   father. But Jesus said unto him, Follow Me; and let the dead bury their
   dead. And when He was entered into a ship, His disciples followed Him.
   And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea. We may go where
   Christ goes and yet we may get into danger! Never judge the rightness
   of your path by the Providence which attends it. You may have safe
   sailing to the port of destruction and you may have a rough voyage when
   you are bound for Heaven! "When He was entered into a ship, His
   disciples followed Him. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the
   sea"--

   24. Insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but He was
   asleep. Weary with His toil, He lay down to rest. There was His
   Humanity serenely confident and, therefore, sleeping through the storm!
   There was the Glory of His innocence--"He was asleep." And there was
   also the majesty of His Deity, only waiting for the moment when He
   should arise and still the tumult of the winds and waves.

   25-27. And His disciples came to Him, and awoke Him, saying, Lord, save
   us: we perish! And He said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of
   little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
   there was a great calm. But the men marveled, saying, What manner of
   Man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him? Glory be to His
   blessed name! Amen.

The Everlasting Arms

   (No. 2435)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 20, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   6, 1887.

   "Underneath are the everlasting arms." Deuteronomy 33:27.

   This short passage is found in the midst of a mass of gold--sentences
   containing the richest treasures of the Truth of God. All this
   spiritual wealth is the heritage of the people of God--not only of His
   typical people to whom these words were spoken, but to His real people,
   the true seed of Abraham, those who are the believing children of the
   Father of all Believers. If you are trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   you may take these precious words home to yourself--and you may live
   upon them--you may eat the fat, drink the sweet and rejoice in all the
   refreshment that they bring to your spirit!

   In the four verses, from the 26th to the 29th, notice how near God is
   said to be to His people. He is described as being above us, arching us
   over with His Divine Power--"There is none like unto the God of
   Jeshurun, who rides upon the Heavens to help you, and in His excellency
   on the clouds." Faith can hear the tramp of the celestial cavalry above
   our heads! We who trust in the Lord are always safe, for the angels of
   God are looking down upon us from the battlements of Heaven, ready to
   show themselves strong on our behalf as soon as their presence is
   needed by us. Then, our text tells us of God beneath us. As He is above
   us in the heavens, so underneath us are the everlasting arms. The next
   sentence shows us God before us--"and He shall thrust out the enemy
   from before you; and shall say, Destroy them." And the remaining verses
   of the chapter represent Him as being all around us, so that we are
   encompassed with God--not only with His Presence, with which He fills
   Heaven, earth and all deep places--but with the glorious Presence of
   His mighty love. He is above, beneath, before, and all around us! He
   never forsakes us, for in Him we live, move, and have our being. Let us
   rejoice, therefore, in our Lord's nearness!

   I. Now, coming to our text, I want, as God's Spirit shall help me, to
   bring to your notice, first, THE QUARTER THAT IS THUS HONORABLY
   SECURED--Underneath.

   "Underneath." Well, in the first place, that is the point of mysterious
   assault. We look for the attacks of the powers of darkness from
   underneath. They are very remarkable attacks--there are many who are
   the objects of them, but there are few who fully understand them. There
   are many of God's children who are often sorely vexed by Satan, yet
   they do not know that it is the devil who is troubling them. They blame
   themselves for thoughts that are none of their own, but which come up
   from the infernal Pit like smoke and sparks from that dread lower
   world. O Friends, if Satan has ever grievously tempted and assailed
   you, you will dread beyond expression any repetition of that temptation
   or assault! Mr. Bunyan well says that a man had better go over hedge
   and ditch--and many miles round about--rather than meet this terrible
   adversary! He not only works through the world and through the flesh,
   but he has modes of personal attack--fiery darts from his own
   hands--false accusations and foul insinuations which come only from
   him. By all these he assails Christians and brings us to a stand so
   that, sometimes, we know not what to do! Just underneath us there seems
   to yawn the awful Pit, out of which Satan rises with his abandoned
   fallen angels, to do us mischief.

   Then comes in this gracious assurance--"Underneath are the everlasting
   arms." Against this mysterious, because incomprehensible foe, whose
   darts are so painful and deadly, God has been pleased to set a shield.
   And He puts underneath you, O child of God, His everlasting arms! You
   may be tempted by Satan, but it shall only be in a measure--God will
   not let him put forth all his diabolical strength! When the Lord
   suffered Satan to tempt Job, there was always a proviso, which said to
   the devil as to the raging sea, "Hitherto shall you come, but no
   further." The Lord pulled him up short just at the point where he hoped
   to destroy the good man--and it shall be so with you, also, tried
   Believer. Underneath you, in your worst attacks from Satan, shall be
   the everlasting arms of the Lord Himself!

   Note a second meaning of this word, "underneath." That is the place of
   our daily pilgrimage. To the Israelites, "underneath" was the burning
   sand of the terrible wilderness. Sometimes, "underneath," were the
   fiery serpents and all manner of evil things, so that their march
   towards Canaan was a continual trial to them. "But," says God to His
   people, "though sense sees nothing underneath but ever-burning sands,
   let faith see underneath the everlasting arms." Some of you go forth to
   your daily labors and you find the place of your service to be a real
   wilderness, full of trial and everything that is unpleasant to you. Yet
   look again, with eyes touched with Heaven's eye-salve and, instead of
   seeing the bitter poverty, and the grinding toil, and the daily trial,
   you will begin to see that God is in it all and, "underneath are the
   everlasting arms!" You shall go cheerfully home to Heaven, borne up by
   God. He who made you will carry you! He who loves you will bear you all
   the days of old till you shall come unto the Mountain of God and stand
   in your lot at the end of the days! I think, therefore, that our text
   applies not only to the point of mysterious assault, but to the place
   of daily pilgrimage and toil.

   Do you not think that this word, "underneath," also relates to the
   place of perilous descent! There are times in a man's life when he has
   to come down. It is not a very easy matter to go down the hill safely.
   Some persons have proved that it is difficult to grow old gracefully,
   but to the Christian it ought not to be impossible or unusual to grow
   old graciously. Still, there are difficulties about that coming down
   the hill of life--coming down in a very material sense, perhaps, from
   competence to real poverty. Coming down as to your mental powers. Being
   conscious of losing your former influence over your fellows. Coming
   down in general repute, through no fault of your own, but through
   circumstances of which you are not the master. All this is very trying
   to human nature. You know that on the way to Heaven there are many Hill
   Difficulties--and brave spirits rather enjoy climbing to the top of
   them! We like a craggy path, hard and rough, where we can keep on
   looking upward all the way even if we have to scramble on our hands and
   knees. There is something pleasant in going up in that fashion, but it
   is when going down into the Valley of Humiliation that we are apt to
   slip. We do not like going down and, as many horses fall at the bottom
   of the hill, so I believe that many people trip at the end of a trial
   when they think it is nearly over and they have no need to look so
   carefully to their feet.

   Well now, dear Friends, if any of you are going down the hill, I think
   the text comes in very sweetly--"Underneath are the everlasting arms."
   You cannot go so low but that God's arms of love are still lower! You
   get poorer and poorer, but, "underneath are the everlasting arms." You
   get older and feebler. Your ears are failing, your eyes are growing
   dim, but, "underneath are the everlasting arms." By-and-by, unless the
   Lord speedily returns, you will have to die--and you will come down
   very low, then--but still it will be true, "underneath are the
   everlasting arms."

   Further, I think that we may use the text as referring to a matter of
   intense concern. Sometimes we say to one another, "Is our religion
   real? We trust we love the Lord, but do we really love Him? We think we
   are reposing in Christ, but are we really doing so? We have a measure
   ofjoy and peace--does it really come through believing in Jesus, or is
   it a delusion of the flesh or of the devil? We have, so far, come a
   long way in the heavenly trail, but are we really going towards Heaven,
   or is it all a mistake?"

   It is a good thing, occasionally, Brothers and Sisters, to look
   underneath. He who never sees what is under him may have great cause to
   do so. Examine your foundations--see what your cornerstones are, for if
   you should be building on the sand, then, in the time of storm, your
   fine building will be all swept away! It is a grand thing if we can
   find this text to be true--"Underneath are the everlasting arms." I dig
   through my experience and, "underneath are the everlasting arms." I
   question my joys. I examine myself about my sorrows, but do I come down
   on the purposes of God, the Immutable faithfulness of the Most High,
   the eternal Truths of God revealed in Scripture? Do I come down upon
   the everlasting arms? If so, I am resting where the whole universe may
   rest--I am resting on a faithful God and I need not be afraid! Do not
   fear to examine yourself! If you do, there is, perhaps, all the graver
   need for the testing and trying. Search and look, and go to the bottom
   of these matters. Happy shall you be if, diving to the very depths, you
   can say, "Yes, underneath are the everlasting arms."

   I shall use this first word of my text in one more way. I think we
   have, here, the secret of singular discoveries that will yet be made.
   We do not at present know the reality of things--we judge according to
   our feelings and by the sight of our eyes--how else can we judge? But
   the day will come when things will appear very differently from what
   they do now.

   There is a huge trouble which has mastered us for years--it has seemed,
   with its dense shadow, to darken our heavenly way for a great length of
   time--but the day will come when we shall look through that trouble and
   we shall find that "underneath are the everlasting arms." Perhaps some
   of us are in sore perplexity. We cannot understand the Lord's
   Providential dealings with us. He does not always tell us the reason
   for His actions--we might not understand it if He did--but we may rest
   assured that He is working out purposes of Infinite Love! He ceases not
   to care for us even when things appear to be at their very worst. I
   bear my willing witness to the faithfulness of God! I am not as old as
   some, but I am old enough to have gone through fire and water, and I am
   here to testify that I have not been burned by the one, nor drowned by
   the other! Cannot many of you say the same? In your sorest trials and
   in your hottest furnaces, has He not been especially present with you
   and bestowed great blessings upon you? 'Tis even so! Then trust Him,
   you saints, for what His Word assures you is gloriously
   true--"Underneath are the everlasting arms."

   Go deeper down. Look further into the real reason of things than you
   have been accustomed to do and you shall come on this solid
   foundation--that God is working out for you infinite and eternal
   blessedness by these light afflictions which are but for a moment.

   II. Now, secondly, let us note THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS QUARTER IS
   SECURED--"Underneath are the everlasting arms."

   The everlasting arms are there and that means, first of all, that God
   Himself is close to us, guaranteeing the eternal safety of all those
   who trust in Him. Of course, where any of his elect arms are, there He
   is, and God is not divided from His own arms. This is our joy and
   comfort that God is with us! What strength it gives to faith to believe
   that God is present! Even the false prophet, Mohammed, had a strong
   faith in god--in Allah--and when he fled for the first time and hid in
   a cave with only one friend, his companion said to him, "Our pursuers
   are after us and there are only two of us." "Stop," exclaimed Mohammed,
   "there are three, for Allah is here!" It was the utterance of a brave
   and grand faith-- would that his whole career had been in harmony with
   it! Wherever there are two of God's people, there is Another with them,
   for God is there. We do not count Him in as we ought to do, yet, if we
   were wise, we would put ourselves down as only ciphers and say, "Nobody
   is there till HE is there! He is the one true, personal Numeral that
   multiplies all these ciphers indefinitely."

   Mr. Wesley said, as he died, "The best of all is, God is with us." And
   that is the best of all, is it not? Underneath is God, Himself. He who
   made the heavens and the earth cannot forsake those who do not forsake
   Him. If you love Him. If you trust in Him, He might as soon cease to
   be, as fail anyone who is relying upon Him. This is the glory of
   Jehovah, that while the gods of the heathen are worthless idols, our
   God hears prayer and answers the cry of His people! Try Him and see if
   it is not so. Blessed are they who trust in Jehovah, for they shall
   find in the living God help in every time of need, and sufficient
   strength for every day of trial! So, then, we see that what might
   appear to us as the dark abyss, the dreary, mysterious underworld, is
   all guarded by Jehovah, Himself--"Underneath are the everlasting arms."

   Our text also means that the Lord's Immutable Purpose is being
   fulfilled. Where God's arms are, He is at work, and He is at work
   accomplishing His purposes of Grace. The text speaks of everlasting
   arms--that is a strength that never fails and never turns aside from
   the purpose to which it has bound itself. O child of God, down deep
   where you cannot see it, the Divine Power of the Eternal Godhead is
   always at work for you! The arms of God are busy on your behalf! He has
   made them bare to show Himself strong in your defense! You can be sure
   of this! God has a purpose of love to all who believe in Him--and that
   purpose of love shall stand fast to all eternity! Whatever changes
   there may be in the appearance of this world and in the great universe
   of which it forms a part, there shall be no change in the Infinite
   resolve of God to bless His people and preserve them to the end. Why,
   Believer, be of good comfort, and say to yourself, "At the bottom of
   everything that happens to me, there is the Immutable Purpose of God
   and God, Himself, working it out!"

   Beside the Lord's Immutable Purpose and His Infinite Power by which God
   is at work for you at all times, our text means that His inexhaustible
   patience is waiting its time. "Underneath are the everlasting arms"
   bearing up your load, sustaining it with long endurance while He keeps
   on working for you--invisible, yet always active on your behalf. Do you
   expect to see your God on this side Heaven? If so, you will be
   disappointed! Are you willing to walk by faith and not by sight? If so,
   you shall have a double blessing, for, "Blessed are they that have not
   seen, and yet have believed." Oh, that the Holy Spirit of God would
   bring you to this point! Having trusted God in the Person of His dear
   Son. Having laid the whole weight of your eternal interests upon Him
   whom God has revealed to be your Savior, you may leave them there in
   perfect safety, without a moment's care or anxiety! God's everlasting
   arms must carry out God's eternal purposes. Not one of His promises can
   fall to the ground, for, "God is not a man, that He should lie; neither
   the son of man, that He should repent: has He said and shall He not do
   it? Or has He spoken and shall He not make it good?" It is God Himself
   who undertakes to bear you up, and bear you through--therefore rest
   assured that He will do it!

   III. I must not speak longer upon that matter, for I must say just a
   little upon the third point. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THIS TEXT IS VERY
   PRECIOUS TO BELIEVERS--"Underneath are the everlasting arms."

   One of these times is, I think, when we are very sick and very feeble.
   The pillows have been fluffed up for you and made as soft as they can
   be. And the bed, which is so apt to grow hard, has been tenderly
   smoothed by kind fingers, yet you sink back as if you were about to die
   of exhaustion! Sink back, then! Be not afraid, for, "underneath are the
   everlasting arms." Perhaps there comes a faintness over you and you
   seem to be sinking, sinking--you know not where--still, "underneath are
   the everlasting arms!" You try to rise, but you cannot. You would
   clutch at something by which you think you might get back to activity,
   but you fall back into the same state of weary languor and pain. Well,
   but still, "underneath are the everlasting arms!" It is delightful to
   feel that our feebleness encroaches upon Omnipotence--that just when
   there is nothing left to us--then God comes in with all His fullness
   and bears us up! He is always faithful and full of compassion--He does
   not afflict willingly, or grieve the children of men--so, when He must
   grieve them, it is then that He displays His special power to
   strengthen and sustain them. Go home to your bed, if so it must be with
   you. If there are wearisome months of sickness and disease awaiting
   you, go home and carry this text with you--"Underneath are the
   everlasting arms."

   Is not this Word of God very sweet, too, when burdened with sore
   troubles, or oppressed with heavy labors? You feel that you need double
   strength and you say, "I cannot keep on any longer. There is too much
   for mortal powers to endure, I cannot bear up under these repeated
   trials. The last time I felt thus, I thought that I had no strength
   left, and now this feeling comes over me again--what shall I do? I am
   thrown down, I am crushed as though men were riding over my head! I
   seem to be cast out like the mire in the streets." Yes, but still,
   "underneath are the everlasting arms." We sang, just now--

   "As your day, your strength shall be." Is that truth or fiction? Ask
   God's people as to their past experience and they will set to their
   seal that God is true! And you, too, shall find it true. Oh, how
   wondrously God's saints have been borne up under persecution--and
   cheerful and glad under oppression! The sweetest songs that ever were
   heard on earth were sung behind prison bars! Perhaps I shall not be
   wrong when I say that the most wonderful joys that ever were felt by
   mortal hearts have been felt by men and women who, on the morrow, were
   to be burned at the stake--but whose very souls have danced within them
   because of the unspeakable delight which the Presence of God has given
   them!

   I think it was Socrates who said, "Philosophers could be merry without
   music." I take the statement from his mouth and alter it, and say,
   Christians can be happy without happy circumstances! They can,
   sometimes, like nightingales, sing best in dark nights. Their joy is
   not mere outward mirth. Sorrows fall upon them, yet, from the deep that
   lies underneath wells up yet more exceeding joy! Yes, "underneath are
   the everlasting arms," and when we can no longer stand, it is a blessed
   thing to lean or fall back on them!

   I have already told you that another time when this text is very sweet
   is when you are going down hill. And some of you may be going down hill
   pretty fast just now. Never mind--"Underneath are the everlasting
   arms." When you come down the hill of old age, you know what lies at
   the bottom. Why, then, go up again, higher than you ever went before,
   renewing your youth and being forever with the Well-Beloved!

   So, dear Friends, I may change the application of my text, "Underneath
   are the everlasting arms," and pass it on to those who are all
   trembling and shaking. Some of you, perhaps, know what I mean. That
   young man has begun to preach a little, but he says, "I fear that I
   shall break down." Dear Brother, if you get a message from God to tell,
   then tell it, and do not be afraid, for, "underneath are the
   everlasting arms." You are seeking to gather a few young people
   together and you are trying to bless them, but you feel your own
   weakness so much that you say, "I know I shall make a failure of it."
   Do not say so, for, "underneath are the everlasting arms!" He who helps
   us when we go down, down, down, is equally ready to do so when we are
   going up in His service! When our ardent zeal is bearing us forward to
   do something more for the Lord than we are quite equal to, then,
   "underneath are the everlasting arms." And if you are seeking greater
   holiness, daring to indulge a loftier joy--if you are trying to sing
   some of those hymns which, a few months ago, you thought were pitched
   in too high a key for you--be bold and daring! Your wing feathers will
   grow by your very attempt to fly! The possibilities of Grace are
   boundless--leave yourself to them. Be not always weak and trembling.
   God help you to become as a David, and you who are as David, to become
   as an angel of the Lord!

   Once more, the hour will come when everything will begin to melt away
   beneath your feet. Earthly comforts will fail you, friends will be
   unable to help you--they can wipe the clammy sweat from your brow and
   moisten your lips with a drop of water--but they cannot go with you on
   the great voyage upon which you are about to be launched. When heart
   and flesh fail, then may the Lord speak to you the sweet words before
   us, "Underneath are the everlasting arms!" It will be a sinking to the
   flesh, but a rising to the spirit! Underneath dying saints there is the
   living God! Be not afraid, therefore, even to die, for, to the
   Christian, "to die is gain." I remember, at a funeral, when we laid the
   body of one of God's saints in the grave, a dear minister prayed,
   "Lord, we thank You that though our dear friend has come so low as to
   be in his grave, he cannot go any lower, for, 'underneath are the
   everlasting arms,' and in due time You will bring him up, again, in
   those everlasting arms, raised in the likeness of his Lord."

   That is true of all Believers! Therefore let this text come sweetly
   home to your heart--"Underneath are the everlasting arms."

   I must conclude with this remark. There are some here who are net yet
   saved. I would illustrate the way of salvation to you by this text. You
   are hoping to save yourself. You are depending upon something that you
   have done, or that you have felt. I want you to let all that go, to
   give up every hope you have that comes out of yourself. "Oh," you say,
   "but I shall fall." Yes, you will, and that falling shall be your
   salvation, for, "underneath are the everlasting arms." There you are,
   up at that window, and the flames are raging behind you so that you
   cannot escape--but one stands below. He is strong enough to catch you
   in his arms and he says, "Drop into my arms! Do not hesitate!" Jesus
   Christ never yet allowed any soul to be injured that dropped into His
   arms. Let go, man, let go! Let go everything and drop into the arms of
   Jesus! That is the saving thing--to let everything else go and trust
   only to Jesus, depending wholly upon Him who lived, and died, and rose
   again--and is the ever-living Savior of sinners. Drop into His arms!
   They are everlasting arms, as strong to save, now, as they were 1,800
   years ago! Drop into His arms. God help you to do so, for His name's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: DEUTERONOMY 8.

   Verse 1. All the commandments which I command you this day shall you
   observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess
   the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers. Every word, here,
   seems emphatic. Like the children of Israel, we are to observe all the
   commandments of the Lord our God--not merely some of them, picking and
   choosing as we please. It is a very ill conscience which regards some
   of God's statutes and pays no attention to others! In fact, the very
   act of making a selection as to what commands we will observe is gross
   disobedience. "All the commandments which I command you this day shall
   you observe to do."

   Notice that we are not only to do as we are bidden, but to do it with
   carefulness--"you shall observe to do." God would not have a
   thoughtless, careless, blind service! We must bow our mind and heart as
   well as our will to His service. Remember, also, that it is not
   sufficient to "observe" the commandments so as to note what they are,
   but we are to "observe to do" them. That observation which does not end
   in right practice is like a promising blossom upon a tree which never
   knits and which, therefore, produces no fruit. Further notice that to
   walk in the ways of God is for our own benefit as well as for His
   Glory--"That you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land
   which the Lord swore unto your fathers."

   There are, doubtless, many good things which we miss because we are not
   careful in our walking. I am sure that the happiest life will be found
   to be that which is most carefully conducted upon the principles of
   holy obedience to God's commands. There are certain blessings which God
   will not give to us while we are disobedient to Him. Many a father
   feels that he cannot indulge his child as he would wish to indulge him
   when he finds the child negligent as to his father's will. So, if we
   please God, God will please us, but, if we walk contrary to Him, He
   will walk contrary to us. Let me read this most instructive verse
   again, that it may be further impressed upon your memories and your
   hearts--"All the commandments which I command you this day shall you
   observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess
   the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers." To help you in
   obeying these commands, it is added--

   2. And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you
   these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you,
   to know what was in your hearts whether you would keep His
   commandments, or no. Look back and derive from your past experience a
   motive for more careful obedience in the future. He does not read his
   own life aright who does not see in it abundant causes for
   gratitude--and how can gratitude express itself better than by a
   cheerful, hearty obedience in the present and the future?

   3. And He humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with
   manna, These two sentences come very closely together--"Suffered you to
   hunger, and fed you with manna." I suppose we are not fit to eat
   heavenly bread till first of all we begin to hunger for it. God loves
   to give to men who will eat with an appetite--"He suffered you to
   hunger, and fed you with manna."

   3. Which you knew not, neither did your fathers know. It was a new kind
   of food and even in the day when they ate it, they did not fully know
   what it was. They saw that it came by a miracle and it remained a
   mystery and, I think we can say that though we have fed upon the Bread
   of Heaven, some of us, for well-near 40 years, yet we hardly know, nor
   dare to think that we know, what it is made of, nor can we tell all the
   sweetness that is in it. We know the love of Christ, but it still
   passes our knowledge. It is true of us, as of Israel in the wilderness,
   "He humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna,
   which you knew not, neither did your fathers know."

   3. That He might make you know that man does not live by bread only,
   but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man
   live. It is a grand thing to be delivered from materialism, to be freed
   from the notion that the outward means are absolutely essential for the
   accomplishment of the Divine Purpose. If God had so willed it, we could
   have lived on air--if the air had been sanctified by the Word of God
   and prayer for such a use! The Lord has, however, chosen to feed us
   upon bread--yet our highest life, our real life, does not live on
   bread, but it lives on the Word which proceeds out of the mouth of God!
   This is one of the passages with which our Lord fought Satan in the
   desert and overcame him. Happy is that servant of God who will arm
   himself with this same Truth and feel, "I am not to be provided for
   merely by money, or by anything else that is visible. God will somehow
   provide for me and I can leave all care about the means, if the means
   fail, and get away to the God of the means and lean, not on what I see,
   but on that arm which is invisible! That which you can see may fail
   you, for it is, like yourself, a shadow. But He whom you cannot see
   will never fail you. The strongest sinew in an arm of flesh will crack,
   but the eternal arm never fails and never is shortened! Lean on that
   arm and you shall never be ashamed, nor confounded, world without end!
   It takes 40 years to teach some people that lesson, but some, alas,
   have not learned it even at the end of 80 years!

   4. Your raiment waxed not old upon you, neither did your feet swell
   these forty years. See how God not only cares for His people's food,
   but for their raiment, also. We may, therefore, well take heed to
   Paul's injunction--"Having food and raiment let us be therewith
   content." Whether it was by a miracle that the Israelites' raiment did
   not wear out, or whether it came to pass, in the order of Providence,
   that they were able to get fresh clothing when it did wear out, does
   not matter at all--it made no difference to them how it was arranged,
   for it was equal kindness on the part of God who provided for them.
   "Neither did your feet swell." We call the Arab, sometimes, "The
   pilgrim of the weary feet," but the Israelites' feet were not weary.
   They traversed a stony wilderness, yet God kept them in such health and
   strength that their feet swelled not even after 40 years of journeying!
   You and I often get worn out in 40 hours--forty days are as long as we
   can hope to go. But God enabled His ancient people to go on for 40
   years and still their feet swelled not. Dr. Watts sweetly sang--

   "Mere mortal power shall fade and die, And youthful vigor cease. But we
   that wait upon the Lord Shall feel our strength increase! The saints
   shall mount on eagles' wings, And taste the promised bliss, Till their
   unwearied feet arrive Where perfect pleasure is."

   5. You shall also consider in your heart that, as a man chastens his
   son, so the LORD your God chastens you. We sometimes think that we
   could do without the Lord's chastening. If He will give us food and
   raiment and keep our feet from swelling, we will not crave the rod. No,
   but though we do not ask for it, the rod is one of the choicest
   blessings of the Covenant--and if we are the Lord's children, we shall
   not go without it! To come under Divine discipline is one of the
   greatest mercies we can ever have. Many of us, who are now men and
   women, thank God for earthly parents who have corrected us. We wonder
   what we would have been if there had been no discipline in our father's
   house. So, truly, is it with all of us who are God's children--in years
   to come we shall prize the chastisement which now makes us grieve. Even
   now it is well if, by faith, we can apply to our own heart this
   text--"as a man chastens his son, so the Lord your God chastens you."

   6, 7. Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God,
   to walk in His ways, and to fear Him. For the LORD your God brings you
   into a good land, a land of brooks of water, offountains and depths
   that spring out of valleys and hills. There are changes in our
   condition. Israel was not always in the wilderness--the chosen people
   were brought into a good land, into a place of rest from their weary
   wandering. So it may happen to you and to me that even in temporal
   circumstances, God may work a great change for us--and especially will
   He do this in spiritual matters. After a time of wilderness traveling,
   we who have believed enter into rest--we come to understand the
   Gospel--and he who understands the Gospel is not, any longer, in the
   wilderness! In a certain sense, he has come into the land of promise
   where he already enjoys Covenant mercies. It is true that the Canaanite
   is still in that land and we have to drive him out, but it is a good
   land to which God has brought us, "a land of brooks of water, of
   fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills." The Lord
   makes us drink of the river of His good pleasure. He satisfies us with
   the cooling streams of His Covenant love.

   8. A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
   pomegranates; a land of olive oil, and honey. I will not go into a
   spiritualizing of all this, but I know that you who have come to
   believe in Christ and have entered, by faith, into His rest, know what
   sweet things God has provided for you--not merely bare necessities, but
   choice delights. He gives you to eat of the sweetnesses. He gives you
   the fatnesses--the wines on the lees, well-refined, and the fat things
   full of marrow. I trust that there are many here who know the blessed
   experience of joy and peace in believing. You have entered into a fair
   region. You have passed through the belt of storms. You have come where
   the trade winds blow heavenward, Your sails are filled, your vessel
   skips along before the breeze. You are making good progress towards the
   Fair Havens of eternal happiness!

   9. A land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not
   lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose
   hills you may dig brass. There are deep things hidden away in the
   Gospel treasuries. Silver and gold there may be none, but then, iron
   and copper are much more useful things--and the most useful things we
   shall ever need in this life lie hidden beneath the surface of the
   Gospel! If we know how to dig deep, we shall be abundantly rewarded by
   the treasures which we shall discover. Well now, if your experience has
   thus changed. If you have left the fiery serpents and the howling
   wilderness behind you and have come into a place of peace and
   enjoyment, what follows?

   10. When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the LORD
   your God for the good land which He has given you. He permits you to
   eat--not to satiety, but you may eat and be full--only not so full but
   that you can always bless His name! Do not be afraid of holy joy! Eat
   and be full of it, only let it never take your heart away from Him who
   gives you the joy. On the contrary, bless your God for the good land
   which He has given you. It is said that in the olden times, pious Jews
   always blessed God before they ate, and always blessed God after they
   ate. They blessed God for the fragrance of the flower whenever they
   smelt it. Whenever they drank a cup of water, they blessed the Lord who
   gave them drink out of the rock in the desert. Oh, that we were always
   full of praises of God! Then it would not hurt us to be full of meat.
   But if we get full of meat and are empty of praises, this is
   mischievous, indeed!

   11. Beware that you forget not the LORD your God, in not keeping His
   commandments, and His judgments, and His statutes, which I command you
   this day. That would be practical atheism--not keeping the commandments
   of God is one of the most vivid ways of forgetting Him!

   12-14. Lest when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly
   houses, and dwelt therein; and when your herds and your flocks
   multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you
   have is multiplied; then your heart is lifted up and you forget the
   LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from
   the house of bondage. The other day a friend asked me this question,
   "From where does God get His princes?" And the answer I gave was, "He
   often picks them off dunghills." Oh, but they sometimes forget the
   dunghills where they grew and think themselves wonderfully important
   individuals! Then there is a time of pulling down for them. We cannot
   eat and be full without having the temptation of getting our heart
   lifted up! It is a great blessing to have the heart lifted up in one
   way, that is, in God's way--but to be lifted up by bread, to be lifted
   up by silver, to be lifted up by flocks and herds is such a bad way of
   being lifted up that evil and sorrow must come of it! See, the Lord
   does not forbid His people to build a house, or to eat and to enjoy
   what He gives them. But He does charge them not to forget the God who
   gave them these mercies, nor to forget where they used to be in
   slavery--"Beware that you forget not the Lord your God which brought
   you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."

   16. Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein
   were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no
   water; who brought you forth water out of the rock offlint. I cannot
   but pause as I remember my own passage through "that great and terrible
   wilderness, where there was no water." When a soul is under conviction
   of sin, "fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought" are very feeble
   images of the pains and miseries that come of guilt unfor-given! "Where
   there was no water." Oh, what would we not have given, then, to have
   understood a little of that Gospel which, perhaps, we now despise? Oh,
   what would we not have given, then, just to have moistened our burning
   lips with the Living Water of the precious Word in which, possibly, now
   we see no refreshing? May God have mercy upon us for our forgetfulness
   of His great mercy! Let us, with deep gratitude, think of Him
   again--"Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein
   were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no
   water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint." "More
   likely," says one, "to bring fire rather than water out of a rock of
   flint." And it did seem as if the Cross of the curse must have cursed
   us, yet it blessed us! The Lord brought forth Living Water out of that
   Rock which was smitten for guilty man!

   16, 17. Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers
   knew not, that He might humble you, and that He might prove you, to do
   you good at your latter end; and you said in your heart, My power and
   the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth. We must not say this
   about either temporal or spiritual wealth! If we have grown in Grace
   and have become useful, and are spiritually a blessing to others, we
   must not take any credit for it--or else down we shall go before long!
   God did not enrich you that you might set up for a god in opposition to
   Him. Christ did not love you that you might make yourself a rival to
   Him. Oh, that must not be! We must never say in our heart, "My power
   and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth."

   18,19. But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is He that
   gives you power to get wealth, that He may establish His Covenant which
   He swore unto your fathers, as it is this day. And it shall be, if you
   do at all forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and
   serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you
   shall surely perish. If you live like sinners, you will die like
   sinners! "Where, then, is the perseverance of the saints?" asks one.
   Why, in this, that they shall not live like sinners! God's Grace will
   not let them go wandering after idols to worship and to serve them! He
   will keep us faithful to Himself, but if we will wander after idol
   gods, it proves that we are not the Lord's true Israel, and we must
   expect to be served as others have been who have turned aside to
   worship idols--

   20. As the nations which the LORD destroys before your face, so shall
   you perish; because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the
   LORD your God.

"How Good to Those Who Seek!"

   (No. 2436)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 27, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 23, 1887.

   "The LORD is good to the soul that seeks Him." Lamentations 3:25.

   I DO not know whether it has ever struck you what a grand man Jeremiah
   was. If you were to read the book of his prophecy through, from
   beginning to end, and make yourself familiar with the circumstances
   under which the Prophet spoke and wrote, I think you would come to
   admire him as one of the greatest men who ever lived, for he was not,
   like Isaiah, brightened and cheered by having a joyful message to
   deliver, but he had received a sorrowful burden from his Lord--and he
   faithfully carried it out--and when the people rejected his testimony
   and refused his message, he went on delivering it all the same. There
   was no gleam of success to gladden his ministry, yet he never flinched!
   Nobody seemed to believe in him--he was the jest and the by-word of the
   people, but that did not matter to him at all. He was tender and
   affectionate, so that he cried, "Oh that my head were waters, and my
   eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain
   of the daughter of my people!"

   Yet he was as stern and unflinching as if his face had been made of
   adamant stone. I think him second to no man in the whole list of human
   beings who have ever lived. Therefore, when I found some of those with
   whom I have been in controversy of late describing one of my protests
   against false doctrine and worldliness as a, "Jeremiad," or a
   Jeremiah's Lamentation, I said to myself, "That is the highest
   compliment they could pay me." If they call me a fool, even, I will,
   nevertheless, accept the epithet with delight! I count it no dishonor
   to have to lament as Jeremiah did, and to have to bear a sorrowful
   testimony even as Jeremiah did--and in that great day when the Lord
   rewards His servants, the rewards will not be in proportion to the way
   in which their testimony was received, but in proportion to the
   fidelity with which they delivered it! If Jeremiah is rejected of men,
   yet, if he has delivered his Master's message, he is not rejected of
   his Master! And in that great day when God, the Judge of all, shall
   bring us to account, we who have spoken out of the depths of our soul
   and have had our testimony made jest and a by-word, shall receive none
   the less honor from our Lord if we have faithfully delivered it!

   I begin with this thought, concerning the man who uttered my text,
   because the people who speak somewhat sorrowfully and sadly are said to
   be "pessimists." It is an ugly word, yet I have had it applied to
   myself. Whereas other men who speak very brightly--possibly more
   brightly than they ought to speak--those who have rose-colored glasses
   for everything, are called "optimists." Well now, when a man is in deep
   distress of mind and in sore trouble of heart, if a person comes to
   him, and says, "Oh, my dear Sir, there is really not much the matter
   with you! It is a very simple thing to cure, and I will soon get you
   through it," you say to yourself, "That gentleman is an optimist," and
   you make very large deductions from what he has to say because you feel
   that he is inclined to flatter, and to put a brighter face upon things
   than they ought to wear!

   But if another person comes, who is called a pessimist, one who always
   makes the worst of everything--a man who writes "Jeremiads" and who
   utters lamentations--if he, nevertheless, says something very bright
   and cheering, you say to yourself, "Now I know that what he says is
   true. There must be something really cheering and hopeful when such a
   man as that, who dares to look at the dark side of things, can yet
   venture to encourage me." Well now, it is the Prophet Jeremiah, in his
   Book of Lamentations, who says to you who are seeking the Lord, "The
   Lord is good to the soul that seeks Him." You do not need to take any
   discount off his words of cheer! Depend upon it, what he says is true!
   If he of the weeping eyes. If he of the sorrowful spirit, nevertheless,
   in all the bitterness of his misery, bears testimony that the Lord is
   good to the soul that seeks Him, then, depend upon it, it is so! So we
   begin at an advantage. I pray you to believe the text because of the
   man who was inspired to utter it.

   I shall try briefly and earnestly, first, to describe a seeking soul.
   Next, to assure him that God is good to him. And then further to cheer
   him on in his seeking.

   I. First, I am to try to DESCRIBE A SEEKING SOUL.

   Everybody does not seek the Lord. There are many who say to God, by
   their actions if not by their words, "Depart from us; we desire not the
   knowledge of Your ways." The man who seeks the Lord is the man who
   feels that he needs Him. He is under a sense of need--a need which he
   could hardly describe, but which, nevertheless, weighs very heavily
   upon him. He needs something very great, but he hardly knows what it
   is. He feels that he has a void--an emptiness within that needs
   filling. There is a something that he believes would content him if he
   could get it, but he has not got it yet. He feels that he is not right
   with God. He feels like one who is far off from God. He feels guilty
   and he needs pardon. He feels sinful and he needs renewing. He feels
   everything that he ought not to be and he wants to be changed, to be
   made a new man. That is the one who seeks the Lord--a man does not seek
   after that which he does not want--but a conscious and urgent need
   drives the troubled soul to seek after God.

   This seeker, also, is one who, though he does not know it, has a
   measure of faith, for he believes, deep down in his heart, that if he
   could once get to God, all would be well with him. He has heard of God
   in Christ Jesus and he says within himself, "Oh, if I could but find
   this blessed Mediator! If I could but discover this glorious Lamb of
   God who takes away the sin of the world, it would be well with me." He
   has not believed so as to appropriate Christ, but he believes so much
   as to wish that he could appropriate Him. This is the man who seeks the
   Lord. We do not seek for that which appears to have no value in it,
   but, in proportion as a man has, first, a sense of his need, and
   secondly some idea of the value of the great blessing which he needs,
   he becomes an earnest seeker! I hope I am talking to some persons of
   this kind as I am describing their true character.

   Further, this seeker sometimes seeks very unwisely. He goes to seek God
   where he will never find Him, like the holy women did when they went to
   the sepulcher to find the risen Christ, and the angel asked them why
   they were seeking the living among the dead! When a soul wants God, and
   needs salvation, it will begin to seek the Lord by its own doing, by
   its own feelings, by its own strange eccentricities, perhaps. It wants
   God and it must have Him! You know how a starving man will break
   through stone walls to get at the food that he so terribly needs, and,
   often, a man who is seeking after God would go through stone walls, or
   over them, if he might but find Him--yet that is not the way to seek
   the Lord. "Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven? (that
   is, to bring Christ down from above), or, Who shall descend into the
   deep? (that is, to bring up Christ, again, from the dead)." Christ is
   not far off, He is very near you--and yet the seeker is unwisely
   seeking after God as though He were far away--and for Christ as though
   he had to do some strange and wonderful thing in order to find Him.
   Some of you think that you must have a remarkable dream. Others expect
   an angelic vision. Some are waiting to hear a very extraordinary sermon
   and to feel very amazing emotions. This is the nature of seekers, that
   they often seek in a very unwise way. But still, they do seek--and it
   is a mercy that they do--for, "the Lord is good to the soul that seeks
   Him."

   I will tell you what true seekers do when they act wisely. I notice
   that they often get alone. When you begin to seek the Lord, my young
   Friend, you will steal away by yourself. Father and mother will say,
   "We do not quite know what has come over him, he seems so different
   from what he used to be. He gets up into his little room--we think he
   must go there to pray." If his parents are gracious people, they begin
   to have great hope of him. I remember times when I was never so happy
   as when I could get alone. Seekers, true seekers, will find some quiet
   place. That is a difficult thing to find in this noisy London, yet a
   real seeker will make even a crowded street to be his place of
   retirement, or he will walk down some back alley and be thinking, and
   crying, and seeking and groaning! But in the country, how often have I
   known young lads to get down a sawpit, or up a hayloft, or in the
   corner of a barn, or anywhere where they could but sit in quiet
   meditation and try to think their way to Jesus' feet, that they might
   find Him if they could. That getting alone is a good sign. When a stag
   is wounded, it delights to hide in the recesses of the forest that it
   may bleed and die alone. And when God has shot His arrow of conviction
   into a human heart, one of the first signs of the wounding is that the
   man likes to get alone.

   I will tell you another thing about the true seeker. You will find that
   he begins to bring out his Bible, that much-neglected Book. Now that he
   is seeking the Lord, he knows that--

   "Within this sacred Volume lies, The mystery of mysteries."

   And he begins to study his Bible as he never did before! It is a
   blessed sign when the young man or the young woman begins to take an
   interest in the Word of God and searches the Scriptures, saying, "Lord,
   bless this Book to me. The Christ is here. He feeds among the lilies of
   Your revealed Truth. Oh, that I might meet Him, and that I might call
   Him mine!"

   And as, perhaps, in his study of the Scriptures he meets with
   difficulties, you will find that this seeking young man is anxious to
   go and hear the Word preached, for the Word rightly preached has a
   warmth about it and a vividness which are not always so manifest to the
   seeker in his reading of the Word. If you are true seekers, I know that
   you will want to go and hear a preacher who touches your conscience,
   who speaks to your heart and who longs to bring you to Christ. My dear
   Hearers, I do not mind where you go on the Sabbath if you really hear
   the Truth of God faithfully preached. As far as I am concerned, there
   are plenty of people here, but I do wish that, on the Sabbath, and on
   weeknights too, you would not have any desire to go and hear a "clever"
   preacher, or to some fine musical service, but that you would say, "We
   have to care, first, for our immortal souls, and we long to seek and
   find eternal life, therefore let us go where the minister preaches
   Jesus Christ and Him Crucified. Let us go where we can hear the Gospel
   of the Grace of God, for that is what we need." You cannot afford to
   throw away a single hour, either in listening to human oratory or to
   any other kind of performance. With you, it must be, "Give me Christ,
   or else I die." Therefore, be diligent in hearing the Gospel preached.

   That is, then, another mark of a true seeker--he loves to be alone, he
   searches the Scriptures, he goes as much as he can to hear the Gospel
   preached.

   And there is another sign of the true seeker that I always love to
   see--he likes to get into godly company. He does not care, now, for the
   friends he once so much admired--his merry friends who laughed away the
   years--if he can but get where he can hear a few poor people talking
   about Jesus! Something like John Bunyan, you remember, who saw three or
   four godly women at Bedford talking about the things of God and the
   tinker drew near and listened to their gracious conversation, though
   their talk about the new birth was beyond his comprehension! That is
   good seeking when you turn eavesdropper to hear about Christ, when you
   like to listen to some poor neighbor who does not know much more than
   you know, yourself, but who, in her simple language, talks about an
   experience of the things of God to which you have not as yet attained,
   but which you wish you had felt and known!

   There is another mark of a seeker that is still better--"Behold, he
   prays." Possibly, he used to repeat a form of prayer, but he has given
   that up and now he talks to God straight out of his heart and asks for
   what he really needs. And he not only does that morning and evening,
   but he is praying during most of the day! If you watch him from the
   other side of the counter, you may hear a sigh every now and then. Or
   when he is at his work, driving the plane, or using the hammer--if you
   are close to him, you may see his lips moving and you may catch such
   words as these, "Savior, reveal Yourself to me. Blood of Christ,
   cleanse me. Spirit of God, renew me." That is one of the men who are
   seeking the Lord!

   I think there will be one more mark that you will see upon a sincere
   seeker--he will quit all that is evil as much as possible and he will
   seek after that which is good--and especially he will seek after faith
   in the Lord Jesus Christ. He has heard it said that he that believes in
   Him has everlasting life and he says to himself, "Oh, that I could
   believe in Him!" You will see him, now, trying to believe, very much
   like a little child tries to take his first steps in walking alone. His
   mother holds out an apple and baby makes a daring venture to try, with
   three or four steps to get across to where mother holds out the bribe!
   Oh, I love to see poor souls trying to trust Christ, trying to rest in
   Jesus! They often make sorry work of it, but still, the Lord accepts
   it, for with their hearts they are really trying to rest in Jesus! If,
   poor trembling Seeker, your faith should bring you no comfort because
   it is so weak--keep on trusting to Christ!

   When the bronze serpent was lifted up, all who looked to it were
   healed. There were, doubtless, some clear bright eyes that saw the
   bronze serpent from its head to its tail and, as they looked, they
   lived. But there were probably others who were so bitten by the
   serpents that their eyes were swollen and dim--they could only see out
   of the corners and the death-damp seemed to blind even that little bit
   of sight which they had--but, oh, if they could only get just a
   glimpse, so as just to see the glittering brass, though they could not
   make out the shape of the serpent, yet they lived! They were bid to
   look and if they looked, and could not see, yet the promise was not to
   the seeing, but to the looking! And so, as they looked, they were
   healed! Thus look to Jesus and you shall live.

   I trust that many seekers here have come as far as this. If so, I may
   now conduct them to the next stage of my sermon.

   II. I want, in the second place, to ASSURE THE SEEKING SOUL THAT THE
   LORD IS GOOD TO HIM--"The

   Lord is good to the soul that seeks Him."

   "Ah," says one, "my heart is almost ready to break! I have been seeking
   so long, I feel so sad, I am so discouraged." But, "the Lord is good to
   the soul that seeks Him." Let me show you this Truth of God very
   rapidly.

   First, it is good of Him to have set you seeking at all. He might have
   left you in your sins as He has left so many millions of your fellow
   men. He might have left you to be content with this vain, wicked world.
   At this moment you might have been leaning across the counter of the
   gin palace instead of listening to the Word of the Lord. Yes, instead
   of going home to pray, you might have been getting to the harlot's
   haunt and, tomorrow, instead of coming to the Prayer Meeting, you might
   have been found where the multitude amuse themselves with vice. Thank
   God that you are a seeker, for there is something good in that fact! On
   a dark night you may be grateful for one star shining in the sky, or
   even for a single match--it is very little, you think, but thank God
   for that little! "The Lord is good to the soul that seeks Him," in
   setting him seeking at all!

   But God is also good to the seeker in giving him some gleams of
   comfort. Did you say that you had been seeking the Lord for months?
   Well, how is it that you have kept on seeking? I think it must be
   because you have, sometimes, had a few rays of light. I cannot give you
   any better evidence than my own. I was long in seeking Christ and for
   that I blame myself, not Christ. But there were times, before I found
   Him, when I almost met with Him. I did not see Him, but I seemed to see
   the trees move as He passed along! I did not see Him, but I heard His
   footsteps and, sometimes I went home and said to myself, "Oh, yes, I
   shall find Him! I shall not cry to Him in vain." I even thought,
   sometimes, that I had laid hold of Him and that I had trusted Him--and
   though I went back, again, into despondency, yet I was not without hope
   of ultimately finding Him.

   You know what it is, sometimes, when you are very hungry and you cannot
   get a meal, if you can get just a bite or two of something, it keeps
   you up till the mealtime comes. Well, it was like that when I was
   hungering and thirsting for Christ. Many a crumb this poor dog picked
   up from under the Master's table and so I was encouraged to keep on
   seeking till I found my Savior. Is it not so with you, dear Friend?
   Yes, the Lord is good to them that seek Him by just keeping their
   courage up and preventing them from sinking utterly into despair! Is He
   not good in keeping back the temptation which might have destroyed you?
   The foul insinuations of Satan trouble you, but they might be worse
   than they are! You have been driven almost to despair, but not quite.
   You have grated against the rock, but you are not shipwrecked yet. "He
   stays His rough wind in the day of the east wind." Thank God for that!
   "The Lord is good to the soul that seeks

   Him."

   I think that He is also good in not letting us rest short of Himself.
   You would have liked to have had comfort long ago, would you not? Yes,
   but comfort is not the main thing that you require--you need safety.
   Often the surgeon, when he has a bad case, will not let the wound heal.
   "No, not yet," he says. "if that wound heals too soon, there will be
   more mischief coming from it." So he lets in his lancet again and cuts
   out a bit of proud flesh. And our Lord will not let us close up the
   wound that sin has made lest it is but a sorry healing that will end in
   a worse wound than before! I pray God that no one who is really seeking
   Christ may ever be able to rest till he gets to Him. There is good
   resting at the foot of the Cross, but you want to rest before you get
   there! I thank God for not letting you rest until you get to Christ.
   And I hope you will say--

   "I will not be comforted Till Jesus comforts me."

   Make that your resolve and may the Spirit of God keep you up to it! If
   so, you, too, will also prove that "the Lord is good to the soul that
   seeks Him."

   But He is much better to them that seek Him than you have ever
   imagined, for He has given such rich promises to seekers. Oh, the
   blessed invitations of Christ! "Come unto Me, all you that labor and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." "Come now, and let us
   reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they
   shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall
   be as wool." "Let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man
   his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy
   upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon." This blessed
   Book is full of such promises as these--just the kind of promises that
   seeking souls need! And they all prove that the Lord is, indeed, good
   to them that seek Him.

   He is also good to seekers because He has made the way of salvation so
   plain. Brothers and Sisters, there are certain gentlemen, nowadays, who
   want us to have what they call an advanced theology, an eclectic
   religion which will suit those who are supposed to be "cultured!" O
   God, save me from ever hearing such a thing as that! I want to be the
   means of saving to the poor and needy, the ignorant and the fallen--and
   God wishes to save such people--and, therefore, He puts the Gospel very
   plainly, "Believe and live. Trust the great Sacrifice, rely on Jesus
   Crucified and you are saved, and saved forever." A man with an
   intellect not much above that of an idiot may understand this Gospel
   and enjoy it! While a man with the greatest mental powers cannot
   understand it any better--no, he cannot understand it at all unless the
   Spirit of God shall reveal it to him! I thank God that it is not a
   difficult way of salvation that He has laid before us, but that it is
   simple, or as men say, "as plain as a pikestaff." God bring us all to
   accept this gracious plan of salvation!

   Then, once more, is it not very good of the Lord in being found of
   seekers in due time? There is no true seeker who shall die in his sins.
   If you are sincerely seeking, you shall find--this is promised in our
   Lord's own words that we read just now--"For everyone that asks,
   receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks it shall be
   opened." If I could take you through the whole dread region of Hell. If
   we could pause at every cell where the finally impenitent are shut up
   without hope. And if it were possible to interrogate every lost spirit,
   there would not be found, there, a single one that sincerely sought the
   Lord through Jesus Christ! No one shall be able to stand up at the Last
   Great Day and say, "I came to Jesus, but He cast me out. I trusted Him,
   but He did not keep His promise." No, my dear Hearer, if ever you shall
   be lost, it will be because you never came to Christ, because you never
   trusted Him, because you would not have Him as your Savior! But if you
   come to Christ--poor, ragged, defiled, loathsome, guilty up to the
   hilt--if you come to Christ, remember that He said, "Him that comes to
   Me I will in no wise cast out." And that Word of God still stands true!
   If you seek the Lord with all your heart, you shall surely find Him,
   for He "is good to the soul that seeks Him."

   I try to speak to you very plainly, as if I were talking to you by your
   own fireside. I do not feel at any great distance from you in standing
   here to speak to all of you round about me, yet I half wish that I
   could get a hold of your hands, you unconverted ones, and say to you,
   "Believe that my Lord is good to them that seek Him! Believe it and
   seek Him for yourselves!" He is a good Lord. We sang, a few minutes
   ago--

   "Oh, hope of every contrite heart! Oh, joy of all the meek! To those
   who fall, how kind You are! How good to those who seek!" Those are not
   mere words--they are the very Truth of God! He is, indeed, good to
   those who seek Him.

   III. But, lest I weary any seeker where I want to win him, I shall
   close by FURTHER CHEERING HIM ON IN HIS SEEKING.

   Friend, be of good comfort, Christ is seeking you. It is written, "The
   Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." If I were
   at this time seeking a person in London, I might have a long and
   difficult task--it would be like the proverbial "hunting for a needle
   in a haystack." But suppose I knew that the person I was seeking was
   also seeking me? I think then I should say that there was a double
   probability of our meeting! If I am seeking him, and he is seeking me,
   and especially if he who seeks me is a man of high intelligence and
   wide knowledge, we shall meet one of these mornings or evenings, depend
   upon it! So, if you are seeking Christ, that is hopeful. But if Christ
   is seeking you and He knows all about you--all the ins and outs of you
   poor life--He and you will come together soon, I am persuaded of it!
   You are drawing nearer to each other every hour and it will not be long
   before your arms are about His neck and His arms about yours! You will
   be rejoicing in Him and He will be rejoicing over you!

   I want to give you another word of good cheer, my seeking Friend. It
   may not be long before you find the Savior. It may, indeed, be so
   little a while that, before the clock strikes again, you will have
   found Him! Why not? "Oh," you say, "I wish it might be so! Oh, that I
   might find the Lord in that short time!" Well, look at me! I had been
   seeking Christ some four or five years under a heavy burden of sin. I
   remember well that Sabbath morning in the month of January, 1850, for
   there was a very severe snowstorm. I was going to the Congregational
   Chapel at Colchester that morning, but it snowed so heavily that I
   turned into the little Primitive Methodist Chapel, merely because of
   the heaviness of that snowstorm.

   I was cold at heart, almost despairing. I thought that I would never
   find the Savior, but between half-past ten o'clock, when I entered that
   place, and half-past twelve o'clock, when I was back at home, again,
   what a change had taken place in me! I had passed from darkness into
   marvelous light, from death to life! Simply by looking to Jesus, I had
   been delivered from despair and I was brought into such a joyous state
   of mind that, when they saw me at home, they said to me, "Something
   wonderful has happened to you!" And I was eager to tell them all about
   it. I was like Bunyan when he wanted to tell the crows on the plowed
   field all about his conversion! Yes, I had looked to Jesus as I was,
   and found in Him my Savior! Well now, this October Sabbath night, you,
   dear Heart, have been seeking the Lord for ever so long. You will not
   need to seek Him any more if you will but look to Him--that is all you
   have to do! Look to Him! Look to Him! Look to Him and, as you look to
   Him, the great transaction will be done--your burden will be gone, the
   joy of salvation will be given to you from Heaven by God's own right
   hand--and you shall have a new song in your mouth, your feet shall be
   set upon the Rock and your goings shall be established!

   And mark you this--when the blessing comes, it will be worth waiting
   for! When the pardon of your sin comes, you will say, "I do not regret
   my cries and tears, my weary waiting and anxious seeking. He has come!
   He has come! HE has come, my Lord and my God!" Why, if I had to wait at
   the posts of His door from youth to old age, yet if I found Him at
   last, it would well repay all my waiting! The joy and peace through
   believing, which come from Christ, are a wonderful off-set against the
   tears and sorrows that we have endured while we have been seeking Him.

   This is my closing thought--you have no need to go about seeking Christ
   any longer. You have no need to wait even five minutes before you find
   Him, for it is written, "He that believes on the Son has everlasting
   life." Do you know what it is to believe on Him, to trust Him? Do so
   now! "It would be a great venture," says one. Then venture on Him!
   "Would He save me?" Try Him! You have heard, I dare say, of the African
   who came over to England. Before he came, the missionary told him that,
   sometimes, it was so cold in England that the water grew hard and men
   could walk on it. Now, the man had heard a great many things that were
   not true which he had believed, but this, he said, he would never
   believe! It was "one great big lie, for nobody ever could walk on
   water." When he woke up, one December morning, and the stream was
   frozen over, he still said that he would not believe it. Even when his
   friend went on the ice and stood there, and said, "Now you can see that
   what I told you was true. This is water, yet it is hard, and it bears
   me up." The African would not believe it, till his friend said to him,
   "Come along," and he gave him a pull and dragged him on the ice, and
   then he said, "Yes, it is true, for it bears me up."

   I would like to give some of you a bit of a pull like that! I am
   resting on Christ, on Christ alone, and He bears me up! Come along and
   try Him for yourselves! May the Lord lead you to do so! There never yet
   was a heart that truly trusted in Christ that was deceived by Him!
   Remember that verse which we sang at the beginning of the service,
   and--

   "Venture on Him, venture wholly Let no other trust intrude! None but
   Jesus Can do helpless sinners good!"

   Then shall you know for certain that "the Lord is good to the soul that
   seeks Him." God bless and save you, everyone, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 7:7-29.

   Verse 7. Ask, and it shall be given you. He that will not ask for it
   deserves to go without it. Have you ever asked for it? If not, whose
   fault is it that you have it not?

   7. Seek, and you shall find. How can you hope to find if you do not
   seek? Have you never found it? Have you never sought it? And if you
   have never sought it, how do you excuse yourselves for your neglect?

   7. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Is that all--knock? Is the
   gate of Heaven not opened to you? Have you ever knocked? Do you wonder,
   therefore, that the door is shut? Take care, for the time may come when
   you will knock and the door will not be opened to you, for, "when once
   the Master of the house is risen up, and has shut the door," then
   knocking shall be in vain. But at present this verse is still God's
   gracious word of command and promise--let me read it to you
   again--"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find;
   knock, and it shall be opened unto you."

   8. For everyone that asks, receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to
   him that knocks it shall be opened. When you are dealing with men, this
   is not always true. You may ask and not receive. You may seek and not
   find--you may knock and not have the door opened to you. But when you
   deal with God, there are no failures or refusals! Every true asker
   receives; every true seeker finds; and every true knocker has the door
   opened to him! Will you not try it and prove for yourself that it is
   so?

   9-11. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son asks for bread, will
   he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a
   serpent? If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
   your children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven give
   good things to them that ask Him? You not only give, but you know how
   to give so as not to disappoint the asker. It is most blessedly so with
   the great Father in Heaven! He will not give you that which will mock
   and disappoint you--He will give you bread, not a stone--fish, not a
   serpent! No, more, He will give you the Bread of Life, and the Water of
   Life, that you may live forever!

   12. Therefore all things whatever you would that men should do to you,
   do you even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets. This is
   rightly called, "the golden rule." Christ says of it that it is, "the
   Law and the Prophets." It is the essence of them, it is the sum and
   substance of the highest morality. What you would that others should do
   to you, do that to them. Do not let that golden rule remain merely as a
   record in this Book, but take it out with you into your daily life. If
   we did all act to others as we would that others should act to us, how
   different would the lives of many men become! Ours would be a happy
   world if this Law of Christ were the law of England and the law of all
   nations! God send us the Spirit by whom, alone, we shall be able to
   obey so high a rule!

   13. Enter you in at the strait gate. The narrow gate.

   13, 14. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to
   destruction, and many there are which go in thereat because strait is
   the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto life, and few there
   are that find it. Do not try to go with the majority--truth is usually
   with the minority. Do not count heads and say, "I am for that which has
   the most on its side," but prefer that which is least liked among men!
   Choose that which is most difficult, most trying to flesh and
   blood--that which gives you least license because--"strait is the gate
   and narrow is the way which leads unto life, and few there are that
   find it." You will not hit upon it, then, in a "happy-go-lucky" sort of
   style. Heaven's gate is not found open by accident--there was never
   anybody yet who was saved by accident! No, "few there are that find
   it," is still true. God grant that we may be among the few! And why
   should we not be?

   15. Because of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing,
   but inwardly they are ravening wolves. There are always plenty of them
   around! There is nothing of the sheep about them but the skin--and
   there is no connection between that skin and those that wear it.

   16-20. You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
   thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree brings forth good
   fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot
   bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
   fruit. Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and
   cast into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits you shall know them. You
   may judge men as well as trees that way--and you may judge doctrines
   that way. That which gives a license to sin cannot be true. But that
   which makes for holiness is true, for, somehow, truth of doctrine and
   holiness of life run together. We cannot expect holiness to grow out of
   lies, but we may expect all manner of evil to come out of false
   teaching.

   21. Not everyone that says unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   Kingdom of Heaven; but he that does the will of My Father, which is in
   Heaven. Practice is the true test, not words. Not he that says, "Lord,
   Lord," but, "he that does the will of God." Not he that merely has good
   words on his tongue, but he that has the will of God laid up in his
   heart and worked out in his life--that is the man who "shall enter into
   the Kingdom of Heaven."

   22, 23. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
   prophesied in Your name? And in Your name have cast out devils? And in
   Your name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them,
   I never knew you: depart from Me, you that work iniquity. If our lives
   are evil, it does not matter to what denomination we belong! We may be
   clever preachers, or mighty teachers. We may fancy that we have had
   dreams and visions. We may set ourselves up to be some great ones, but
   if we have not done the will of God, we shall, at the last, hear Christ
   say to us, "Depart from Me, you that work iniquity."

   24, 25. Therefore, whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them,
   I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock: and
   the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat
   upon that house and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. He was
   a good man and a practical man, yet he was also a tried man. His house
   was built on the rock, but that did not prevent the rain descending,
   the floods coming and the winds blowing! The highest type of godliness
   will not save you from troubles and trials! It will, in some measure,
   even necessitate them. But, blessed be God, here lies the gem of the
   parable or narrative--"It fell not: for it was founded upon a rock." It
   could stand the strain and endure the test, for it had a good
   foundation.

   26, 27. And everyone that hears these sayings of Mine, and does them
   not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon
   the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
   blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of
   it. He was a great hearer, but he was a bad doer--yet he thought that
   he was a good doer, for he built a house. Alas, the house was on the
   sand! There was no real obedience to Christ, no true trusting in Him
   and so, when the time of trouble came--and trouble will come even to
   the hypocrite and to the false professor--we read of his house, "It
   fell: and great was the fall of it," because it could never be built up
   again! It fell hopelessly! It fell forever! Therefore, "Great was the
   fall of it."

   28, 29. And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
   people were astonished at His doctrine: for He taught them as one
   having authority, and not as the scribes. There was a force and power
   about what Jesus said. He spoke from the heart. He spoke with the
   accent of conviction, whereas the scribes and Pharisees only spoke
   magisterially and officially, with no heart in their utterance--and
   there was, therefore, no power about it. God give to all of us the
   Grace to know the power of the Words of Christ! Amen.

Prayer, the Proof of Godliness

   (No. 2437)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   27, 1837.

   "For this cause shall everyone thatis godly pray unto You in a time
   when You may be found." Psalm 32:6.

   ALL men are not godly. Alas, the ungodly are the great majority of the
   human race! And all men who are, to some extent, godly, are not equally
   godly. The man who fears God and desires to truly know Him has some
   little measure of godliness. The man who has begun to trust the Savior
   whom God has set forth as the great Propitiation for sin has a blessed
   measure of godliness. The man whose communion with God is constant,
   whose earnest prayers and penitential tears are often observed of the
   great Father, and who sighs after fuller and deeper acquaintance with
   the Lord--this man is godly in a still higher sense. And he who, by
   continual fellowship with God has become like He, upon whom the image
   of Christ has been photographed, for he has looked on Him so long and
   rejoiced in Him so intensely--he is the godly man! The man who finds
   his God everywhere, who sees Him in all the works of his hands. The man
   who traces everything to God--whether it is joyful or calamitous--this
   is the godly man. The man who looks to God for everything, takes every
   suit to the Throne of Grace and every petition to the Mercy Seat--the
   man who could not live without his God, to whom God is his exceeding
   joy, the help and the health of his countenance, the man who dwells in
   God--this is the godly man. This is the man who shall dwell forever
   with God, for he has a Godlike-ness given to him and, in the Lord's
   good time, he shall be called away to that blessed place where he shall
   see God and shall rejoice before Him forever and ever!

   Judge yourself, dear Hearers, by these tests, whether you are godly or
   not. Let conscience make sure work about this matter. Possibly, while I
   am preaching, you may be helped to perform this very necessary work of
   self-examination. The text, itself, is a test by which we may tell
   whether we are among the godly--"For this cause shall everyone that is
   godly pray unto You in a time when You may be found."

   In these words we have, first, the universal mark of godly men. They
   pray unto God. Then we have, secondly, a potent motive for
   praying--"For this cause shall everyone that is godly pray unto You."
   And then, thirdly, we have the special occasion when prayer is most
   useful, the occasion of which the godly avail themselves
   abundantly--they shall "pray unto You in a time when You may be found."
   All these points are well worthy of our earnest consideration.

   I. The first is, THE UNIVERSAL MARK OF GODLINESS--"For this cause shall
   everyone that is godly pray unto

   You."

   When a man is beginning to be godly, this is the first sign of the
   change that is being worked in him, "Behold, he prays." Prayer is the
   mark of godliness in its infancy. Until he has come to pleading and
   petitioning, we cannot be sure that the Divine life is in him at all.
   There may be desires, but if they never turn to prayers, we may fear
   that they are as the morning cloud and as the early dew--which soon
   pass away. There may be some signs of holy thought about the man, but
   if that thought never deepens into prayer, we may be afraid that the
   thought will be like the seed sown upon the hard highway which the
   birds of the air will soon devour. But when the man comes to real
   pleading terms with God--when he cannot rest without pouring out his
   heart at the Mercy Seat--you begin to hope that now he is, indeed, a
   godly man! Prayer is the breath of life in the newborn Believer! Prayer
   is the first cry by which it is known that the newborn child truly
   lives! If he does not pray, you may suspect that he has only a name to
   live--and that he lacks true spiritual life.

   And as prayer is the mark of godliness in its infancy, it is equally
   the mark of godliness in all stages of its growth. The man who has most
   Grace will pray most. Take my word for it as certain that when you and
   I have most Grace, we may judge of it by the fact that there is more of
   prayer and praise in us than there was before. If you pray less than
   you once did, then judge yourself to be less devout, to be less in
   fellowship with God, to be, in fact, less godly! I know of no better
   thermometer to your spiritual temperature than this--the measure of the
   intensity of your prayer. I am not speaking about the quantity of it,
   for there are some who, for a pretense, make long prayers. I am
   speaking about the reality of it, the intensity of it. Prayer is best
   measured by weight rather than by length and breadth and, in proportion
   as you grow in Grace, you will grow in prayerfulness, depend upon it!
   When the child of God reaches the measure of the fullness of the
   stature of a man in Christ Jesus, then he becomes like Elijah, a man
   mighty in prayer. One such man in a Church may save it from ruin! I go
   further and say that one such man in a nation may bring down upon it
   untold blessings! He is the godli-est man who has most power with God
   in his secret pleadings--and he who has most power with God in his
   secret pleadings has it because he abounds in godliness! Everyone that
   is godly shall pray unto the Lord, whether he is but the babe in Grace
   who lisps his few broken sentences, or the strong man in Christ who
   lays hold upon the Covenant Angel with Jacob's mighty resolve, "I will
   not let You go, except You bless me." The prayers may vary as the
   degree of godliness differs, but every godly man has, from the
   beginning to the end of his spiritual life, this distinguishing mark,
   "Behold, he prays."

   Further, dear Friends, true prayer is an infallible mark of godliness.
   If you do not pray, remember that old true saying, "A prayerless soul
   is a Christless soul." You know how often it has been the case that the
   highest professions of holiness have been sometimes accompanied by the
   practice of the deadliest vices. For instance, wherever the doctrine of
   human perfection has been much held, it has almost always engendered
   some horrible licentiousness, some desperate filthi-ness of the flesh
   which is unknown to anything but that doctrine! In like manner, I have
   known persons to become, as they say, so conformed to the mind of God,
   so perfectly in accord with the Divine Will that they have not felt it
   necessary to pray. This is the devil in white--nothing else--and the
   devil in white is more of a devil than when he is dressed in black! If
   anything leads you to decline in prayerfulness, or to abstain
   altogether from prayer, it is an evil thing, disguise it as you may!

   But wherever there is real prayer in the soul, take it as certain that
   the lingering of holy desire in the spirit proves that there is still
   life in the spirit. If the Lord enables you to pray, I beseech you, do
   not despair. If you have to pray with many a groan, and sigh, and tear,
   think none the less of you prayers for that reason! Or, if you think
   less of them, the day may come when you will think better of your
   broken prayers than of any others. I have known what it is to come away
   from the Throne of Grace feeling that I have not prayed at all! I have
   despised my prayer and wept over it, yet, some time after, in looking
   back, I have thought, "I wish I could pray as I did in the time when I
   thought that I did not pray at all." We are usually poor judges of our
   own prayers! But this judgment we may make--if the heart sighs, and
   cries, and longs, and pleads with God, such signs and tokens were never
   in an unregenerate heart! These flowers are exotics--the seed from
   which they grew must have come from Heaven! If you pray a truly
   spiritual prayer, this shall be, indeed, a sure mark that the Spirit of
   God is striving within you and that you are already a child of God!

   Once more, beloved Friends,prayer is natural to the godly man. I do
   think that it is a good thing to have set times for prayer, but I am
   sure that it would be a dreadful thing to confine prayer to any time or
   season, for to the godly man prayer comes to be like breathing, like
   sighing, like crying. You have, perhaps, heard of the preacher who used
   to put in the margin of his manuscript sermon, "Cry here." That is a
   very poor sort of crying that can be done to order, so, you cannot make
   the intensity of prayer to order--it must be a natural emanation from
   the renewed heart! Jacob could not always go and spend a night in
   prayer. It is possible he never spent another whole night in prayer in
   all his life after that memorable one! But when he spent that one by
   the brook Jabbok, he could "do no other," as Luther said. Pumped-up
   prayer is little better then the bilge water that flows away from a
   ship! What you need is the prayer that rises from you freely, like the
   fountain that leaped from the smitten rock. Prayer should be the
   natural outflow of the soul--you should pray because you must pray, not
   because the set time for praying has arrived--but because your heart
   must cry unto your Lord.

   "But," says one, "sometimes I do not feel that I can pray." Ah, then,
   indeed, you need most to pray! That is the time when you must insist
   upon it that there is something sadly wrong with you. If, when the time
   has come for you to draw near to God--you have the opportunity and the
   leisure for it, but you feel no inclination for the holy
   exercise--depend upon it that there is something radically wrong with
   you! There is a deadly disease in your system and you should, at once,
   call in the heavenly Physician. You have need to cry, "Lord, I cannot
   pray. There is some strange mischief and mystery about me. There is
   something that ails me! Come, O Lord, and set me right, for I cannot
   continue to abide in a pray-erless condition!"

   A prayerless condition should be a miserable and unhappy condition to a
   child of God--and he should have no rest until he finds that once more
   his spirit can truly pour itself out before the living God! When you
   are in a right state of heart, praying is as simple as breathing. I
   remember being in Mr. Rowland Hill's chapel at Wotton-Under-Edge, and
   stopping at the house where he used to live. I said to a friend who
   knew the good man, "Where did Mr. Hill use to pray?" He replied, "Well,
   my dear Sir, I do not know that I can tell you that. And if you were to
   ask, 'Where did he not pray?' or, 'When did he not pray?' I should be
   unable to tell you. The dear old gentleman used to walk up and down by
   that laurel hedge and if anybody was outside the hedge, he would hear
   him praying as he went along. Then he would go up the street and keep
   on praying all the time. After he had done that, he would come back,
   again, praying all the while. And if he went indoors and sat down in
   his study, he was not much of a man to read, but you would find that he
   was repeating some verse of a hymn, or he was praying for Sarah Jones
   who was ill, or he would plead for Tom Brown who had been backsliding."

   When the old man was in London, he would go up and down the Blackfriars
   Road and stand and look in a shop window. And if anybody went to his
   side, it would be found that he was still praying, for he could not
   live without prayer! That is how godly men come to be, at last--it gets
   to be as natural to them to pray as to breathe! You do not notice all
   day long how many times you breathe. When you come home at night, you
   do not say, " I have breathed so many times today." No, of course you
   do not notice your breathing unless you happen to have asthma! And when
   a man gets asthma in prayer, he begins to notice his praying! But he
   who is in good sound spiritual health breathes freely, like a living
   soul before the living God--and his life becomes one continual season
   of prayer.

   To such a man, prayer is a very happy and consoling exercise. It is no
   task, no effort. His prayer, when he is truly godly and living near to
   God, is an intense delight! When he can get away from business for a
   few quiet minutes of communion with God, when he can steal away from
   the noise of the world and get a little time alone--these are the joys
   of his life! These are the delights that help us to wait with patience
   through the long days of our exile till the King shall come and take us
   home to dwell with Him forever!

   Those prayers of the godly, however, may be presented in a great many
   forms. Some praying takes the good form of action--and an act may be a
   prayer. To love our fellow men and to desire their good is a kind of
   consolidated practical prayer. There is some truth in that oft-quoted
   couplet by Coleridge--

   "Heprays best, who loves best All things, both great and small."

   There comes to be a prayer to God in giving alms, or in preaching the
   Gospel, or in trying to win a wanderer, or in taking a child upon your
   knee and talking to it about the Savior. Such acts are often most
   acceptable prayers, but when you cannot act thus, it is well to pour
   out your heart before the Lord in words. And when you cannot do that,
   it is sweet to sit quite still and look up to Him and, even as the
   lilies pour out their fragrance before Him who made them, so do you,
   even without speaking--worship God in that deep adoration which is too
   eloquent for language--that holy nearness which, because it is so near,
   dares not utter a sound lest it should break the spell of the Divine
   silence which envelopes it! Frost of the mouth, but flow of the soul,
   is often a good combination in prayer. It is blessed prayer to lie on
   your face before God in silence, or to sigh and cry, or moan and wail,
   as the Holy Spirit moves you. All this is prayer, whatever shape it
   assumes, and it is the sign and token of a true Believer's life.

   I think that I have said enough upon that first point--the universal
   mark of godliness is prayer.

   II. Secondly, there is, in the text, A POTENT MOTIVE FOR PRAYING--"For
   this cause shall everyone that is godly pray unto You in a time when
   You may be found."

   The motive seems to be, first, because God heard such a great sinner as
   David was. Possibly you know that this passage is very difficult to
   interpret. It appears to be simple enough, yet there are a great many
   interpretations of it. In the Revised Version you will find the
   marginal reading, "In the time of finding out sin." Let me read the
   context--"I acknowledged my sin unto You, and my iniquity have I not
   hid: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and You
   forgave the iniquity of my sin. For this let everyone that is godly
   pray unto You in the time of finding out sin." It runs all right and
   the context seems to warrant it. I am not sure that it is the correct
   translation, but the sense harmonizes with it, so let us learn from it
   this lesson, that God has heard the prayer of a great sinner!

   There may be, in this House of Prayer, someone who has gone into gross
   and grievous sin--and this reading of the passage may be a message from
   the Lord to that person. David had sinned very foully and he had added
   deceit to his sin. His evil deeds have made the ungodly to rail at
   godliness even until the present day, so that infidels ask in contempt,
   "Is this the man after God's own heart?" It was an awful sin which he
   committed, but there came to him a time of finding out his sin. His
   heart was broken in penitence and then he went to God and found mercy
   and he said, in effect, that it was so wonderful that such a wretch as
   he should be forgiven, that every godly man, as long as the world
   stood, would believe in the confession of sin to the Lord and in the
   power of prayer to obtain pardon for the guilty! I like that meaning of
   the text, for it is sometimes necessary to us, when we are under a
   sense of sin, to think of such sinners as Manasseh, Magdalene, the
   dying thief and Saul of Tarsus. There are times, even with those whom
   God has greatly blessed, when nothing but the sinner's Savior will do
   for them. And when they feel that if there were not salvation for the
   vilest of the vile, there would be no salvation for them!

   So God gives us a case like that of David, that everyone that is godly
   may pray unto Him in the time of finding out his sin. We might have
   been afraid to come if David had not led the way! "Come," he says of
   the broken heart, he who wrote the 51st Psalm, "God forgave me and He
   did it that He might show forth in me all long-suffering, for a pattern
   to them who should hereafter repent and believe."

   Another motive for prayer which I think the text brings before us is
   this, we all need daily pardon--"For this cause shall everyone that is
   godly pray unto You." "For this"--for this covering of sin, for this
   blotting out of iniquity. Dear Friends, I hope that all of you pray
   unto God daily for the forgiveness of sins. I am sure that all the
   godly among you do so. If you commit no sins, then the Savior made a
   great mistake when He left us the prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses."
   What is the need of that petition if we have no trespasses to be
   forgiven? But for this, that is, for the pardon of his sin, everyone
   who is godly will pray unto the Lord.

   And everyone who is godly will pray unto God for this reason, also,
   namely, because he has received the pardon of sin. You remember when
   you made your confession to the Judge of All and received absolution
   from Him? You remember when, with broken heart and downcast eye, you
   acknowledged your sin unto Him and He put away your transgression? Well
   then, that is the reason why you should always be praying! He who heard
   you, then, will still hear you! He who put away your sin, then, by that
   one great washing in the Fountain filled with blood, will continue to
   put away your sin by that foot-washing which He continually gives to
   us, of which Jesus said, "He that is washed needs not, save to wash his
   feet, but is clean every whit." Blessed be God, we shall not cease to
   pray for pardon although we have received pardon! We will crave the
   daily renewal of the Divine token of reconciliation. If we received it
   when we were sinners, much more shall we receive it, now that we are
   reconciled to God by the death of His Son! If we received it when we
   were outcasts, much more shall we receive it, now that we are His dear
   children!

   Again, "For this cause shall everyone that is godly pray unto You,"
   that is to say, because troubles come, for the context teaches us this
   lesson. "Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near
   unto him. You are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble."
   Brethren, the Lord takes care to keep us praying, does He not, by
   giving us constant needs? Suppose that I had a friend upon whom I was
   dependent and whose society I greatly loved, and that he said to me, "I
   will give you, in a lump sum, as much money as will last you till this
   time next year, and then you can come and see me and receive another
   year's portion. Or, as you like to come to my house, would you prefer
   to have the amount quarterly?" I would reply, "I will choose the latter
   plan, for then I should come to you four times in the year and have
   four dinners with you."

   "Well, then, would you like it monthly?" "Oh, yes! I would like to come
   monthly and spend a day with you every month." "Perhaps," he says, "you
   would like to come daily?" "Oh, yes! I would prefer that! I would like
   to have a daily portion at your table." "Perhaps you would like to stay
   with me always, as Dr. Watts did when he went to Sir Thomas Abney's, to
   stay for a week, and I think that 'week' lasted for 28 years, for he
   never went away till he died. Perhaps you would like to receive
   everything from my hand and have nothing but what I give you." "Oh,
   yes, my Friend, this continual indebtedness, this constant dependence
   would give me so many opportunities of better knowing you whom I love
   so much that I would like to have it so."

   You have heard of "a hand-basket portion." There is a maid to be
   married and her father says to her, "There, my girl, I will give you so
   many hundred pounds. Do your best with it, for it is all I shall have
   for you." Another girl is married and her father says, "I shall send
   you down a basketful of things on such a day" and so, every week, a
   present goes to her. It is a hand-basket portion, and it is always
   coming! It never comes to an end and she gets a great deal more from
   the old man than the other does, who has her fortune all at once. At
   any rate, it comes, every time, "with father's love." If it is given
   only once and is done with, perhaps, an ill feeling, animosity springs
   up. But if it comes, "with father's love," 50 or a 100 times a year,
   see how affection is increased between father and daughter! Give me a
   hand-basket portion!

   You who like may go and gather a week's manna--it will stink before the
   end of the week! I like to have mine fresh every day, just as it comes
   warm from the ovens of Heaven and ready for the heavenly appetite of
   the man who learns to live upon the daily gift of God! For this cause
   shall everyone that is godly pray unto God. He shall have trouble to
   drive him, he shall have Grace to draw him, he shall have weights to
   lift him and they shall be so adjusted that though they threaten to
   hold him down, they shall really raise him up!

   Once more, I think that, broadly speaking, the word, "this," here
   means, "Because God hears prayer, for this reason shall everyone that
   is godly pray unto Him." Now, dear Friends, it always will be a dispute
   between the true Believer and the mere professor whether God hears
   prayer. Of course the outside world will always sneer at the idea of
   God hearing prayer! A man said to me, one day, "You say that God hears
   your prayers?" "Yes, I do say it." Said he, "I do not believe it."
   "No," I said, "I never thought you did. And if you had believed it, I
   might have thought that it had been a mistake! I did not expect a
   carnal mind to receive the Truth of God." "Oh," said he, "there is
   nothing in it!" Then I asked him, "Did you ever pray, my Friend? Did
   you ever pray God?" No, he never did. "Very well, then," I said, "do
   not say anything about what you do not know! If you know nothing about
   what it is, hold your tongue till you do--and let those of us who have
   tried it speak of what we know."

   If I were put in a witness box tomorrow, any lawyer in London would
   like to have me for a witness. So, when I stand here and declare
   solemnly that hundreds and even thousands of times God has answered my
   prayers, I claim to be as much accepted as an honest witness as I
   should be in the High Court of Justice. And I can bring forward, not
   myself, only, but scores and hundreds of you! Brethren, tell me, does
   not God hear prayer? [Voices--"Yes! Yes! Yes!"] I know He does and you
   godly folk can all bear witness that it is so! Calmly and deliberately,
   you could tell of many instances in which you called upon the Lord and
   He answered you. I am loath to argue this point, for it is not a point
   to be argued. If a man said that I had not any eyes, he might say it
   and my eyes would twinkle as I heard him say it. And when anyone says,
   "God does not hear prayer," I am sorry for the poor soul that dares to
   make an assertion about a thing which he has never tested and tried!

   God does hear prayer and because He hears it we will call upon Him as
   long as we live! "For this cause shall everyone that is godly pray unto
   You"--because there is reality in it and there is a blessed result from
   it! Prayer moves the arm that moves the world, though nothing is put
   out of gear by our praying. The God who ordained the effects that are
   to follow prayer ordained the prayer, itself--it is a part of the grand
   machinery by which the world swings upon its hinges! III. I have not
   time to say more on that part of my subject, though so much more might
   be said. The last point is one to which I want to call your earnest
   attention--that is, THE SPECIAL OCCASION WHEN PRAYER IS MOST USEFUL.
   "For this cause shall everyone that is godly pray unto You in a time
   when You may be found," or, "in a time of finding," as the margin of
   our Bibles has it. Is there any set time when God is to be found?

   Well, in general, it is the time of this mortal life. So long as you
   live, here, and pray to God, He has promised to answer. Though it is
   the 11th hour, do not hesitate to pray! Christ's word is, "He that
   seeks, finds." There is a special promise to those who seek the Lord
   early, but this does not exclude those who seek Him late. If you truly
   seek Him, He will be found of you.

   I think, too, that the time of finding is under this Gospel
   dispensation. God has always heard prayer, but there seems to be a
   larger liberty allowed us in prayer, now. The Mercy Seat is unveiled
   and the veil is torn away that we may come with boldness. But besides
   that, there are special times of finding God, namely, in visitations of
   His Spirit. Revival times are grand times for prayer! How many there
   are who put in their suit with God because they feel moved thereto by a
   heavenly impulse! There is "the sound of a going in the tops of the
   mulberry trees," as there was with David, and they begin to bestir
   themselves.

   In closing, I will dwell only upon this one point--there are special
   times offinding for individuals and one of these is the time of the
   finding out of sin. Come back to the translation which I gave you
   before. The time when you will find out sin is the time when you will
   find God. "Why," you say, "it is a horrible thing for me to find out my
   sin." It is, in itself, but it is the best time to find out God! When
   your eyes are blinded with tears of penitence, you can best see the
   Savior. Do not say, "I find myself to be so guilty and, therefore, I
   have no hope." No, rather, because you find yourself to be guilty,
   therefore have hope, for the Savior came to seek and to save such
   guilty ones as you are! The time, I say, when sin finds us out, and we
   are humbled and ashamed, is the time when we may find our God through
   Jesus Christ.

   So, too, a time of decision is a time for finding God. Some remain
   shilly-shallying--they have not decided whether they will live for the
   world and perish, or seek Christ and live eternally. But when the
   Spirit of God comes upon you and you say to yourself, "I must find
   Jesus Christ, I must get forgiveness and lay hold of eternal life. Give
   me Christ, or else I die," you shall have Him! God has promised that if
   we seek Him with our whole heart, He will be found of us. When you are
   decided for God thoroughly and intensely, it will be with you a time of
   finding.

   So will it be when you come to God in full submission. Some of you have
   not laid down your weapons of rebellion yet. You cannot be reconciled
   to God while your sword is in your hand--down with it, Man! Some of you
   have fine feathers on your helmets and you come before God as great
   captains--off with those feathers! He will accept you in rags, but not
   in ribbons! He will receive you if you come confessing your sin, but
   not boasting of your supposed merits. Down with you into the very dust!
   Yield to God! Oh, that His mercy might make us all pliant as the willow
   before His mighty power! Then shall we find peace through Christ.

   I believe that it is a time of finding when you come to concentration.
   I have known men, sometimes, say with a holy determination, "I am
   resolved that I will find Christ. I will find salvation and everything
   else shall go till I do. I shall go upstairs to my room, shut the door
   and not come out, again, till I have found the Lord." When the whole
   soul is bent on seeking Christ, then will the Lord speedily appear, and
   it shall be a time of finding!

   But especially is it a time of finding when the heart, at last, trusts
   wholly and implicitly to the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the
   world. You shall find that God has found you when you have done with
   yourself and taken the blood and righteousness of Christ to be the sole
   hope of your soul! God lead you to this, dear Hearers, this very hour!

   I know that there are some here who are seeking the Lord. There are
   some who have lately begun to come under great anxiety. I hope that you
   will not be long in that anxious state, but that you will come right
   out of it by trusting yourselves with Christ. It is a wonderful end to
   anxiety when you have somebody to trust and when you trust that
   somebody. Now, trust Jesus! He will save you. Yes, He saves you the
   moment that you trust Him, and He will never let you go, but will bring
   you to His Glory above!

   May God send His blessing on these words, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM33.

   Verse 1. Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous: for praise is comely for
   the upright. Notice the context between the words, "rejoice," and,
   "praise." Joy is the soul of praise. God is not extolled by our misery,
   but by our holy mirth! Be glad in the Lord, for so can you make Him
   glorious. "Rejoice" and "praise," "for praise is comely for the
   upright." Praise is the beauty of a Christian. What wings are to a
   bird, what fruit is to the tree, what the rose is to the thorn, that is
   praise to a child of God!

   2. Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto Him with the Psaltery and an
   instrument of ten strings. In the old days of forms, ceremonies and
   outward worship, musical instruments were abundantly used. But in the
   early Christian Church there was no such thing as a musical instrument
   because the Believers were afraid of going back to Judaism. It is
   curious that as men get further away from Christ, they get fonder and
   fonder of such things as these! Still, under certain conditions, they
   are lawful, though, we think, not expedient. God was acceptably
   worshipped in the olden time with harp and with Psaltery--and He may be
   so now--yet we worship Him, so we judge for our own selves, better
   without them.

   3. Sing unto Him a new song. For, you see, that all the music had
   singing with it. "Praise the Lord with harp; sing unto Him." "Sing unto
   Him a new song." "Unto the Lord, unto the Lord, Oh, sing a new and
   joyful song!" It was only as it guided and strengthened the singing
   that the instrumental music was tolerated even in those early days.

   3. Play skillfully with a loud noise. God ought to be worshipped with
   our best--"Play skillfully." God ought to be earnestly
   worshipped--"with a loud noise." Hearty worship is what the Lord
   desires and what He deserves. Let us render it to Him.

   4. For the Word of the LORD is right. Let us praise Him for His Word.
   Men are depreciating it--let us appreciate it. "The Word of the Lord is
   right"--from the first page to the last it is right, emphatically
   right--let us praise Him for it!

   4. And all His works are done in truth. The book of Providence is full
   of the Truth of God! Oh, for Grace to read it with thankful hearts! Let
   us praise God and sing unto Him as every page passes under our eyes.

   5. He loves righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
   goodness of the LORD. You would think, from the way in which most
   people talk, that the world was full of misery and full of the anger of
   the Lord, but it is not! Notwithstanding all the evil that is in it, it
   is still true that "the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord."

   6. By the Word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of
   them by the breath of His mouth. They did not grow out of something
   that was there before--they were made out of nothing--"by the Word of
   the Lord." All the hosts of innumerable stars were created "by the
   breath of His mouth."

   7. He gathers the waters of the sea together as an heap: He lays up the
   depth in storehouses. We know not how much God has in store, out of
   sight, in the vast abysses, but we know that He drowned the world when
   He broke up the fountains of the great deep.

   8. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the
   world stand in awe of Him. He is so great a God that all the oceans are
   in His sight but as a heap! Let us worship, and adore, and bow down
   before Him.

   9. For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast. With
   God it is no sooner said than it is done! "He spoke, and it was done."
   All that He has to do is but to bid it be so and so it is. And, as it
   was for creation, so is it for confirmation--"He commanded, and it
   stood fast."

   10. The LORD brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing: He makes the
   devices of the people of no effect. If the folly of man yields to God's
   wisdom, so, also, shall the wisdom of man. No matter though men take
   counsel together against the Lord and against His Anointed, God will
   certainly carry out His purposes.

   11. The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of His heart
   to all generations. What the Lord intends to do, He will do--there is
   no turning Him from His purpose--and His dispensations stand fast
   forever.

   12. Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom He
   has chosen for His own inheritance. If you have chosen God, God has
   chosen you! It is a happy thing when it is so. When these two elections
   meet--your election of God and God's election of you--then you are
   happy, indeed!

   13. 14. The LORD looks from Heaven; He beholds all the sons of men.
   From the place of His habitation He looks upon all the inhabitants of
   the earth. Just as in a glass hive you can see all the bees and all
   they do, so can God see us--and He can see all that we think and
   read--and He knows us through and through.

   15, 16. He fashions their hearts alike; He considers all their works.
   There is no king saved by the multitude of an host. Look at Napoleon
   who marched more than half a million men into Russia--but they nearly
   all melted away and, after a time--he, himself, became a captive on the
   lone rock of St. Helena! "There is no king saved by the multitude of an
   host."

   16. A mighty man is not delivered by much strength. Look at Goliath,
   stronger than all his fellows, yet how soon he lay prone upon the earth
   when a single stone from the sling of David smote him in the forehead.

   17-19. An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
   any by his great strength. Behold, the eyes of the LORD are upon them
   that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy; to deliver their soul
   from death, and to keep them alive in famine. Whatever becomes of kings
   and princes in the day of need, the Lord will take care of those who
   fear Him and put their trust in Him! There have been vast numbers of
   cases of amazing Providences--so many that they have ceased to be
   amazing--in which God has provided for those who have trusted in Him.

   20. Our soul waits for the LORD: He is our help and our shield. Dear
   Friends, notice those three, "ours"--three firm clasps, three strong
   holdfasts--"Our soul waits for the Lord: He is our help and our
   shield." Why did He not say, "Our souls wait," for there are many of
   us? Ah, but we are so alike in this one thing that it is as if we had
   only one soul in all these many bodies, so the Psalmist says, "our
   soul." You remember when the disciples went to Emmaus and Christ talked
   with them, they said, "Did not our heart burn within us?" There were
   two of them--why did they not say, "Did not our hearts burn?" Well,
   their hearts were so one that he who spoke, called them, "heart,"
   rather than, "hearts." And it is so here--"Our soul waits for the Lord:
   He is our help and our shield."

   21, 22. For our heart shall rejoice in Him because we have trusted in
   His holy name. Let your mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope
   in You. That is a good prayer with which to close our reading! Let us
   all present it at the Throne of heavenly Grace!

"Two Immutable Things"

   (No. 2438)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 30, 1887.

   "Yes, I swore unto you, and entered into a Covenant with you, says the
   Lord God, and you became Mine." Ezekiel 16:8.

   DURING this last summer I took a little journey into the country, as I
   had an opportunity of preaching and visiting in the region where I
   lived as a little child and where I afterwards spent some of my
   school-boy days. Everything was very vividly interesting to me, much
   more so than it could have been to anybody who was a stranger to the
   district. Now I want some of you, especially you who love the Lord, to
   go back in thought to your early days when you were children in Grace.
   Yes, go back even further than that--to the time of your spiritual
   birth--those first hours when your love to your Lord was true and
   fervent, and everything round about you was fresh and bright and
   joyous.

   Biographies are generally interesting if they are biographies, that is
   to say, if the events of the person's life are truly told. But I think
   that the most interesting biography to any man is his own life. Take
   that book down from the shelf and look into it. You say that you have
   not kept a diary? Well, perhaps not, but you have one in your memory.
   You may have read Pepys' Diary, or Evelyn's Diary--they are
   interesting--but I want to get you to read your own! Turn over the
   pages of the book of memory and think of those first times when you
   sought and found the Savior, when you repented, when you believed, when
   you yielded yourself up to Jesus--when He took you to be His and you
   took Him to be yours! I am sure that this exercise will awaken many
   happy thoughts and I feel equally certain that it will suggest many
   regrets. But the happiness will be good for you if it excites your
   gratitude--and the regrets will be good for you if they deepen your
   penitence.

   I want you, then, to go back for a little time and think of what God
   did for you, then, and of what He has done for you since. You are
   called to this retrospect by such a chapter as the one before us, which
   is God's own statement of how He dealt with the chosen nation. It is
   also, in a parable, the Lord's declaration of how He has dealt with us.
   He remembers it and He would have us remember it and, in the words of
   our text, He reminds us of the Covenant He made with us--"Yes, I swore
   unto you, and entered into a Covenant with you, says the Lord God, and
   you became Mine."

   Beloved, the time of our conversion, the time when we joyously realized
   that we were saved, was a covenanting time! The Covenant, itself, as to
   God's part in it, was made with Christ on our behalf before the earth
   was! It is older than the hills, it is as ancient as God, Himself! But,
   as far as we are concerned, the Covenant comes into practical,
   experimental context with ourselves when we believe in the Lord Jesus,
   rely upon His atoning Sacrifice and depend upon His promises of Grace.
   I repeat that converting times are covenanting times. We made a
   Covenant with God then. We said--

   "'Tis done! The great transaction's done!

   I am my Lord's, and He is mine.

   He drew me, and I followed on,

   Charmed to confess the voice Divine.

   High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow,

   That vow renewed shall daily hear,

   Till in life's latest hour I bow,

   And bless in death a bond so dear!" The Covenant was also on God's
   part, for He has promised to save all those who trust Him. And that
   promise became ours when we trusted His dear Son. All the promises of
   the Covenant of Grace became promises made particularly to ourselves
   when we received the seal of the Covenant by believing in the Lord
   Jesus Christ!

   It is a somewhat singular thing that in this chapter God does not say
   anything about Israel's part of the Covenant. He seems to pass that
   over as though it were never worth mentioning. The nation had so
   entirely forgotten it and had been so altogether untrue to it, that the
   whole stress of the chapter seems to lie on what God did, how God kept
   the Covenant. Though the sin of the people is brought to their
   remembrance, yet the Lord does not say to them, "You entered into
   Covenant with Me," but He says, "I swore unto you, and entered into a
   Covenant with you, says the Lord God, and you became Mine." So, at this
   time, I shall not say much about the Covenant that you made with
   God--do not you forget it--and do not forget that you have often
   forgotten it. You covenanted with God that you would be His and you
   meant it when you made the promise. You know how far you have been true
   to it, but what I want to remember, myself, and for you to remember,
   too, is God's Covenant with us--what He promised to do for us and what
   He has done for us! Let this thought dwell in our minds, that it may
   renew our love to our Lord and make us continually to realize that we
   are truly His because He has made a Covenant with us.

   Here, then, is our text--"Yes, I swore unto you, and entered into a
   Covenant with you, says the Lord God, and you became Mine." My remarks
   upon it will be, first, that it was a Covenant freely made. Secondly,
   it was a Covenant entirely of love. Thirdly, it was a most sure
   Covenant and, in closing, I will try to show you that this Covenant
   involves very gracious consequences.

   I. In the first place, IT WAS A COVENANT FREELY MADE.

   The context tells us that this child, with whom God entered into
   Covenant, was one who could not have had any claim upon Him. It was a
   Covenant which He made at His own suggestion, out of the greatness of
   His own love, for the nation of Israel, of which He speaks, had nothing
   in its pedigree to suggest it. The Lord says, "Your birth and your
   nativity is of the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your
   mother an Hittite." Yet Jehovah entered into Covenant with that people.
   And now, if you look back upon your pedigree--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem, Or give the Creator
   delight?"

   There are some who do not believe in the depravity of human nature. I
   must believe in it if I am, myself, a fair specimen of human nature.
   And every man who has watched his own heart and has any idea of the sin
   which dwells within him will know that his origin is tainted, that from
   the very first there is a tendency to evil and only evil and,
   therefore, that there is nothing in him as to his birth that can
   command or deserve the favor of God. If God enters into Covenant with
   unfallen man, man is so insignificant a creature that it must be an act
   of gracious condescension on the Lord's part! But if God enters into
   Covenant with sinful man, he is then so offensive a creature that it
   must be, on God's part, an act of pure, free, rich, Sovereign Grace!
   When the Lord entered into Covenant with me, I am sure that it was all
   of Grace-- nothing else but Grace--and I think that all of you who know
   what that Covenant means and can claim an interest in it, will say, "In
   my case, at any rate, it was of Grace and of Grace, alone." It was a
   Covenant freely entered into by Divine Grace, for our pedigree did not
   suggest it.

   There was also nothing in our condition to commend it. This poor child
   had never been washed or clothed. It was left in all its filthiness to
   die--there was nothing about it to commend it to the attention of the
   passer-by. And what were we by nature? Oh, dear Friends, let us think,
   with shame and confusion of face, of what we used to be before we knew
   the Lord--

   "Backward with humble shame we look On our original!

   How is our nature dashed and broke In our first father's fall!"

   We were, not all of us, open, profligate sinners--some were, however.
   If I speak of drunks, swearers, fornicators and the like, I may add
   with the Apostle, "And such were some of you; but you are washed." And
   others of us, who were not suffered to run in those evil ways, yet with
   our hearts, with our thoughts, with our tempers and with our spirit we
   sinned grievously in the sight of God. When I remember what a den of
   unclean beasts and birds my heart was, how strong was my unrenewed will
   and how obstinate and rebellious against the Sovereignty of the Divine
   rule, I always feel inclined to take the very lowest room in my
   Father's house. And when I enter Heaven, it will be to go among the
   less than the least of all saints and with the chief of sinners.

   Yes, dear Friends, it is only too true there was nothing in our
   condition to commend us to God, or to induce Him to enter into Covenant
   with us! It was just because He would do it, because He will have mercy
   on whom He will have mer-cy--because when He is showing the greatness
   of His mercy He feels that He may as well show it where it is most
   needed! So He looks, not for merit, but for misery! Not for deserving,
   but for undeserving! According to the riches of His Grace, He abounds
   in mercy towards the very worst of us, pardoning our sin, passing by
   our transgression and blotting out our iniquity.

   It was, then, a Covenant freely entered into because there was nothing
   in our condition to commend it.

   It was also a Covenant freely made because there was nothing in our
   beauty to warrant it. Indeed, there was a total absence from us of
   everything that might be reckoned comely and beautiful. Are you now
   penitent? Yet, then your heart was harder than adamant stone! Are you
   now believing? Then you were an unbeliever! Are you now zealous for
   God? Then you were rather zealous against Him, or if not, you were
   quite indifferent to Divine things! Is there any virtue, is there any
   praise, is there anything of good repute in you? It was not there when
   God entered into a Covenant with you! If there was any beauty in the
   wife who is mentioned in this parable, it was after the marriage. But
   before she was cast out, she was not grown. Whatever there was there
   was undeveloped and, still worse, unclean! And in that day when Jesus
   took us to Himself and we took Him to be our Savior, there was nothing
   as yet apparent of that which His Grace has now worked in us--it was
   totally absent. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, let us praise and magnify
   that Free Grace that entered into Covenant with you and with me!

   That is the first point. It was a Covenant most freely made.

   II. But we cannot linger long on any one part of our glorious subject,
   so we notice, in the next place, that IT WAS A COVENANT ENTIRELY OF
   LOVE.

   Taking our text in its context, we learn that this Covenant was a
   marriage Covenant. It is a very wonderful thing that God should enter
   into a marriage Covenant with His people, but He has done so. The Lord
   Jesus Christ has taken upon Himself our Nature and has become bone of
   our bone and flesh of our flesh, so that, when Paul is speaking of
   marriage, he says, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and
   mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
   flesh." And then he adds, "This is a great mystery: but I speak
   concerning Christ and the Church," which means that Christ has joined
   Himself to His people and become one in Nature with His chosen
   henceforth and forever! The Lord Jesus Christ has taken His people to
   be henceforth as joined unto Him as the wife is joined to her husband!
   They become one and so does Christ make His people one with Himself.
   This is a very easy thing to say, but it is an almost impossible thing
   to compass and understand! Can it really be so, my Soul, that you are
   wedded to the Son of God? Is it really so that He says, "Yes, I swore
   unto you, and entered into a Covenant with you," and that Covenant is a
   Covenant of marriage by which He has joined with Him all His people
   unto His own heart, world without end? Catch that thought if you can,
   and enjoy all the comfort of it--but give God the glory for such
   wonderful condescension--

   "On such love, my Soul, still ponder, Love so great, so rich, so free!
   Say, while lost in holy wonder, Why, O Lord, such love to me?
   Hallelujah!

   Grace shall reign eternally!"

   That it was a Covenant, which was meant to be entirely of love is
   proved by the way in which it was carried out. See how it is said,
   "Then I washed you with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood
   from you, and I anointed you with oil. I clothed you, also, with
   broidered work, and shod you with badgers' skin, and I girded you about
   with fine linen, and I covered you with silk. I decked you, also, with
   ornaments, and I put bracelets upon your hands, and a chain on your
   neck. And I put a jewel on your forehead, and earrings in your ears,
   and a beautiful crown upon your head." And so on. This is a Covenant
   all of love, for these are all love tokens, love-gifts to the beloved
   one!

   Now, will you go back in thought and recollect when you used to receive
   those gifts from the Lord? You remember when your ears were hung with
   earrings. Oh, what hearing that was! You did not grumble at the
   preacher, then--you enjoyed listening to him whenever you could! You
   would be up early and work hard so as to get a half-holiday, that you
   might go and hear the Gospel. Your ears were hung with earrings then!
   And, oh, how you rejoiced in God as He gave you humility, patience,
   zeal, love and all the precious jewels out of the Divine case! You
   hardly thought you had them,

   but other people could see them, and they told you that they were
   there. And they would sometimes say, "How beautiful God has made you by
   His Grace!" Do you remember that? You cannot have forgotten, I hope,
   those happy times when love tokens came to you so fresh and frequent!
   Those evening meditations, how delightful! That sitting up in bed at
   midnight, enjoying the Presence of your Lord--those morning prayers,
   those quiet walks! Oh, how precious were many texts of Scripture! How
   delighted you often were with the visits of the Spirit of God when He
   brought home this and that great Truth to your soul with overwhelming
   comfort!

   I am only reminding you what the Lord has done for you. As for myself,
   He has been all love, goodness, kindness and nothing else to me. Truly,
   a blessed Husband have You been unto my soul, O Jehovah! I cannot find
   fault with You! Neither am I able to find words with which to
   sufficiently praise You for all the love and kindness You have made to
   pass before me. Do you not say the same? I think you do. As we sang,
   just now--

   "Do You ask me who I am?

   Ah, my Lord, You know my name.

   Yet the question gives a plea

   To support my suit with Thee.

   You did once a wretch behold,

   In rebellion blindly bold

   Scorn Your Grace, Your power defy--

   That poor rebel, Lord, was I.

   Once a sinner near despair

   Sought Your Mercy Seat by prayer.

   Mercy heard and set him free

   Lord, that mercy came to me.

   Many days have passed since then,

   Many changes I have seen.

   Yet have been upheld till now--

   Who could hold me up but Thou?" Let us praise the name of the Lord for
   the Covenant which, in the way it has been carried out, has proved to
   be a Covenant all of the Love of God!

   And, dear Friends, I would not have you forget that it must be a
   Covenant all of Love which God has made with such creatures as we are,
   because it could bring the Lord no profit. What benefit could He get
   from us? He may well say, "If I were hungry, I would not tell you: for
   the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof." What glory can we bring
   to Omnipotence? What tribute can we render to Him who is Possessor of
   Heaven and earth?--

   "Could my zeal no respite kno w, Could my tears forever flow,"

   of what use would they be to Him? No, if the Lord enters into Covenant
   with us, it cannot be for any gain to Himself! It must be only out of a
   desire to benefit us. Therefore, let us bow in reverent adoration of
   the unselfish, self-created love of God to us which we have known since
   that dear hour which brought us to His feet and He entered into
   Covenant with us and we became His own! Surely I have said enough upon
   this topic to suggest many a grateful thought within the minds of all
   God's people.

   III. But now I want to carry you with me to another point. That is,
   thirdly, IT WAS A MOST SURE COVENANT--"I swore unto you, and entered
   into a Covenant with you."

   The Covenant which God makes with Believers is intended to remain
   forever. It is not something which may be broken in a few hours, like a
   child's toys--it is an everlasting Covenant. Read that 60th
   verse--"Nevertheless I will remember My Covenant with you in the days
   of your youth, and I will establish unto you an everlasting Covenant."
   How I love to get among the everlasting things! You know, in Canada,
   they build palaces of ice in the winter time and very beautiful things
   they are. But then, when spring comes, where are those palaces? And in
   summer, the very foundation upon which they were built has melted back
   into the St. Lawrence. God does not make with His believing people
   Covenants like those ice palaces--His Covenant stands secure, though
   earth's old columns bow. If God has promised to save you--as He has
   done if you believe in Jesus--He will save you in the teeth of death
   and Hell! Rest you sure of this, and say with David,

   "He has made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and
   sure." Here is something to rest upon--"I swore unto you, and entered
   into a Covenant with you." He intended it to remain!

   And in proof that He intended it to remain, He ratified it by an oath.
   Even among men, where there is an oath, there should be an end of all
   question. And if Jehovah lifts His hand to Heaven and swears, who
   shall, after that, dare to suggest that a question is possible? In the
   day in which we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, He did, as it were,
   swear unto us--"Surely, blessing, I will bless you." "He that believes
   and is baptized shall be saved." We needed nothing more than the
   promises of Jehovah to rest upon, but, "God, willing more abundantly to
   show unto the heirs of promise the Immutability of His counsel,
   confirmed it by an oath: that by two Immutable things, in which it was
   impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have
   fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us." My Soul, be
   you full of comfort, for the God who entered into Covenant with you has
   ratified that Covenant by an oath--

   "His oath, His Covenant and His blood Support me in the sinking flood!
   When all around my soul gives way He, then, is all my hope and stay! On
   Christ the solid Rock I stand-- All other ground is sinking sand." To
   make a Covenant even surer than by an oath, men were accustomed to seal
   it by a sacrifice. They struck hands and then they said, "Let us kill a
   bullock, let us slay a lamb--and the blood shall be the token that this
   covenant is made between us." Now, Beloved, you who believe have the
   precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, as of a lamb without blemish
   and without spot, to confirm the Covenant of Grace. God cannot break
   it! If you believe in Jesus, He must save you, by the pledges of His
   own Son's life and death! If you truly believe that Jesus is the
   Christ, you are born of God. If you believe that God raised Him from
   the dead, you shall be saved. If you are trusting in Him, alone, He
   cannot, He will not cast you away, for the Sacrifice of His Son makes
   the Eternal Covenant sure. Is not the blood of Jesus called, "the blood
   of the Everlasting Covenant"? And herein we see the Covenant most
   surely established.

   I would have you notice, in our text, that the Covenant is remembered
   by God. It is He who says, "I swore unto you, and entered into a
   Covenant with you." He does not forget it. He does not want to forget
   it. He does not intend to forget it. He says, "Can a woman forget her
   sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her
   womb? Yes, they may forget, yet will I not forget you. Behold, I have
   engraved you upon the palms of My hands; your walls are continually
   before Me." The Lord remembers what He did when He swore that He would
   save His people and when He gave Christ to make the Covenant sure!

   Yet once more, this Covenant will be remembered by Him forever. I will
   read again that 60th verse--"Nevertheless I will remember My Covenant
   with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish unto you an
   everlasting Covenant." And then the 62nd verse--"And I will establish
   my Covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the Lord." He made a
   Covenant with Noah that He would not again destroy the earth with a
   flood. And He promised to hang His rainbow in the cloud as a token of
   that Covenant--and He has done so to this day. He has not destroyed the
   earth with a flood and His Covenant, which He has made with the greater
   Noah, who is our true Rest, stands fast, and shall still stand fast
   when Heaven and earth have passed away!

   I want you to think with deepest gratitude of this wondrous
   condescension, that God should ever have entered into such a Covenant
   with you and with me. Why, if I believed what some preach about the
   temporary, trumpery salvation which only lasts for a time, I would
   scarcely be at all grateful for it! But when I know that those whom God
   saves, He saves with an everlasting salvation. When I know that He
   gives to them an everlasting righteousness. When I know that He settles
   them on an everlasting foundation of everlasting love and that He will
   bring them to His everlasting Kingdom, oh, then I do wonder and I am
   astonished! Such a blessing as this to be given to you and given to
   me!--

   "Pause, my Soul! Adore, and wonder! Ask, 'Oh, why such love to me?'"
   Sit still and meditate till your hearts burn within you because of this
   amazing love!

   IV. I finish by noticing that THIS COVENANT INVOLVES VERY GRACIOUS
   CONSEQUENCES. Let me read the text again--"Yes, I swore unto you, and
   entered into a Covenant with you, says the Lord God, and you became
   Mine." Read those last three words again--"Fou became Mine."

   Beloved, if God has entered into Covenant with us, we have become the
   Lord's. Whose were you before? The world's? Your own? The devil's?
   Well, we will not dispute with the many claimants, but now you can
   truly say, "O Lord our God, other lords beside You have had dominion
   over us: but by You only will we make mention of Your name."

   "You became Mine." Do you recollect the spot--perhaps it was your own
   little room--where, as a youth you sat, after having long prayed and
   wept? And at last you felt that Jesus was yours and you sat still, and
   you said to yourself, "Yes, I am His, every bit of me. He has bought me
   with His blood, I am His." Do you remember those first few days in
   which you felt half afraid to do anything lest you should grieve that
   dear Lover of your soul? Then you wanted to do everything that you
   might please Him whose servant you had become. I remember a verse of
   Scripture, which, as a young Believer, I often used to repeat, for it
   was very dear to me. I daresay you love it too. It is this--"Bind the
   sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar." We felt, then,
   that we were wholly Christ's! Do we feel it as much now? "You became
   Mine." To come back to the marriage Covenant of which the Lord
   speaks--when the husband put the ring upon his bride's finger, he said
   to her, "you have become mine." Do you remember when you felt upon your
   finger the ring of infinite, everlasting, Covenant love that Christ put
   there? "You became Mine." Oh, it was a joyful day, a blessed day! Happy
   day, happy day, when His choice was known to me, and fixed my choice on
   Him!

   Now, Beloved, we ought to be the Lord's more and more. Ever since we
   became His, we have been the objects of His love and mercy. He has done
   everything for us. I cannot tell you what He has done, nor can I tell
   you what He has not done, for everything that could be desired and
   wished for, Christ has done for you and for me! This long list which He
   gives, here, of how His spouse was clothed, and shod, and adorned, and
   crowned, reminds me of that verse in the 103rd Psalm where the list of
   benefits reaches its climax--"Who crowns you with loving kindness and
   tender mercies." Well now, after having experienced the blessings of
   this Covenant, we ought to love our Lord Jesus Christ more than ever,
   and we ought to feel that we are more and more completely His than we
   ever were in our lives!

   If that is our feeling, it will lead us to practically renew the bond
   of the Covenant. "You became Mine." After all that the Lord has done
   for us, let us become His, again! Let us come and yield ourselves up to
   Him once more. If any of you have backslidden, or grown cold towards
   your Lord, come and renew your vows unto the Most High. Say, with me,
   "My Savior, I repent not of having yielded myself to You; but I repent
   that I have not more fully carried out my resolve to be wholly Yours.
   If I had never trusted and loved You before, I would desire to begin to
   trust You and love You now, for You are unutterably lovely, You are
   unspeakably worthy of the confidence of every redeemed man and woman!"
   Let us each come and lay our hands, once more, on that dear head which
   was bowed with the burden of our sins--and look up into that dear face
   which has brightened our life so often with its love-glances. And let
   us now surrender ourselves fully, perfectly, joyfully, over, again,
   unto Him whose we are and whom we serve. God help you to do it!

   And you who have never done so, may you come to Jesus this very moment!
   Your only hope lies in Him. God says by the mouth of His servant
   Isaiah, "Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, a leader
   and commander to the people." There is no Covenant between God and man
   except in Jesus Christ! Come, then, and take Christ as your Savior, and
   God has sworn to you, and entered into a Covenant with you, that He
   will never cast you away, but you shall be His in that day when He
   makes up His jewels. God grant it, for His name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EZEKIEL 16:1-3, 6-16; 60-63.

   In this very remarkable chapter, God describes His ancient people,
   Israel, under the figure of an infant which had been cast away, but
   which He had cared for and tended and upon which He had lavished much
   love, making it the object of His choice, on which His very heart was
   set. Yet this specially favored one had gone astray and committed all
   manner of wickedness. But for all that, the love of God had not been
   withdrawn. The whole chapter is a graphic picture of the way in which
   Israel and Judah went after false gods and forsook the only living and
   true God.

   Verses 1, 2. Again the Word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Son of
   man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations. This is a very necessary
   command, for unless men know their disease, they will not apply to the
   great Physician. Only he who knows that he is poor will be willing to
   accept alms. It is, therefore, a necessary part of the duty of God's
   servants to make sinners know their evil ways--"Son of man, cause
   Jerusalem to know her abominations."

   3, 4. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem. Your birth and
   your nativity is of the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and
   your mother an Hittite. Abraham, the father of the nation, came from
   beyond the flood. But here, because of the sin of the people, God
   attributes their birth to the place of their settlement rather than to
   that chosen and noble man. They had lived so long in Canaan that they
   had grown to be Canaanites. Their habits were so evil that there was
   little difference between the Israelites and the Amorites and Hittites
   whom God had smitten in His wrath. So the Lord says, "Your birth and
   your nativity is of the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and
   your mother an Hittite." Then, in the fifth verse, He describes the
   condition of the nation when it was in Egypt, when nobody cared for it.

   5. No eye pitied you, to do any of these unto you, to have compassion
   upon you; but you were cast out in the open field, to the loathing of
   your person, in the day that you were born. You remember that Pharaoh
   tried to destroy all the male children of the captive Israelites. No
   mortal eye had any pity upon the downtrodden race in the house of
   bondage! But God looked down from Heaven in love, pity and Grace.

   6, 7. And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in your own blood,
   I said unto you when you were in your blood, Live; yes, I said unto you
   when you were in your blood, Live. I have caused you to multiply as the
   bud of the field. Israel came out of Egypt exceedingly multiplied, a
   great people! And when they settled down in Canaan, they still
   increased till they became a numerous and powerful nation. Remember
   that all this description applies to us spiritually. There was a day
   when we seemed polluted, cast away and left to perish--but God, in
   great mercy passed by and said unto us, "Live."

   8, 9. Now when I passed by you, and looked upon you, behold, your time
   was the time of love; and I spread My skirt over you, and covered your
   nakedness: yes, I swore unto you, and entered into a Covenant with you,
   says the Lord GOD, and you became Mine. Then washed I you with water;
   yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you
   with oil. How wondrously the Lord did all this for us! Our washing and
   our anointing, we can never forget.

   10. I clothed you, also, with broidered work, and shod you with
   badgers' skin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered
   you with silk. All that God could do for Israel, He did. That poor
   poverty-stricken nation increased and multiplied till, in the days of
   David and Solomon, it was of high repute among the nations and
   exceedingly rich and wealthy! Even so has God dealt with us--He "has
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
   We who, a little while ago, were cast out as helpless and worthless, He
   has greatly enriched with heavenly treasure!

   11-13. I decked you, also, with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon
   your hands, and a chain on your neck. And I put a jewel upon your
   forehead, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your
   head. Thus were you decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was
   offine linen, and silk, and broidered work. The work of the Lord Jesus
   and the work of the Holy Spirit have made marvelously glorious
   "broidered work" for our spiritual adornment! Well does good Dr. Watts
   sing--

   "How far the heavenly robe exceeds What earthly princes wear! These
   ornaments, how bright they shine! How white the garments are!
   Strangely, my Soul, are you arrayed By the great Sacred Three! In
   sweetest harmony of praise Let all your powers agree."

   13,14. You did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you were
   exceedingly beautiful, and you did prosper into a kingdom. And your
   renown went forth among the heathen for your beauty: for it was perfect
   through My comeliness, which I had put upon you, says the Lord GOD.
   Doubtless, these words apply to Israel, but they are still more
   appropriate to us when we are covered with the righteousness of Christ
   and made beautiful in His beauty!

   15,16. But you did trust in your own beauty, and played the harlot
   because of your renown, and poured out your fornications on everyone
   that passed by; his it was. And of your garments you did take, and
   decked your high places with divers colors, and played the harlot
   thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so. As
   soon as the Israelites grew rich and powerful, they began to build
   altars to the false gods! The very treasures that God had given them,
   they desecrated to the making of idols! God calls this a spiritual
   harlotry, turning aside from the one true God, who was the Husband of
   the nation, to follow after false gods. It is an evil sign in any of us
   when God's blessings are, themselves, made into idols. If you begin to
   worship your wealth, your health, your children, your learning, or
   anything that God has given you, this is exceedingly provoking to the
   Most High! It is a breach of the marriage Covenant between your soul
   and God!

   The rest of the chapter is rather for private reading than for the
   public assembly. It gives a truly awful picture of the sin of Israel
   and heaps up most dreadful descriptions of the way in which the people
   turned aside from God. I confess that after reading to the end of this
   chapter, I am astonished to think that it should close as it does. It
   is an amazing instance of the immutable love of God, Turn to the 60th
   verse.

   60. Nevertheless--Blessed "nevertheless"!

   60, 61. Nevertheless I will remember my Covenant with you in the days
   of your youth, and I will establish unto you an everlasting Covenant.
   Then you shall remember your ways and be ashamed. Infinite mercy makes
   men ashamed of their sin-fulness. Great pardon produces both humility
   and holiness. The ungodly think that for God to forgive great sin will
   be to give a license to it, but the Lord knows that it is not so. He
   understands that the greatness of His forgiving love will be the cause
   of the pardoned sinner's hatred of sin--"Then you shall remember your
   ways and be ashamed."

   61-63. When you shall receive your sisters, your elder and your
   younger: and I will give them unto you for daughters, but not by your
   covenant. And I will establish My Covenant with you; and you shall know
   that I am the LORD: that you may remember, and be confounded, and never
   open your mouth any more because of your shame, when I am pacified
   toward you for all that you have done, says the Lord GOD. Pardon from
   God for great sin is a silencer to all our pride. We never dare open
   our mouths, again, because of our shame. Yet the blessed silence of a
   grateful heart makes true music before the Throne of God--and when the
   Lord opens our lips--then our mouth shall show forth His praise.

Five Links in a Golden Chain

   (No. 2439)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1895,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 6, 1887.

   "To Titus, my own [or, "true"] son after the common faith: Grace,
   mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
   Savior." Titus 1:4.

   AMONG the friends of Paul, Titus was one of the most useful and one of
   the best beloved. Paul was the Apostle to the Gentiles and Titus was a
   Gentile. I should suppose that both his parents were Gentiles and, in
   this respect, he differed from Timothy, whose mother was a Jewess.
   Timothy would well serve as a preacher to the circumcision, but Titus
   would be a man after Paul's heart as a preacher to the Gentiles. He
   seems to have been a man of great common sense, so that, when Paul had
   anything difficult to be done, he sent Titus. When the collection was
   to be made at Corinth on behalf of the poor saints at Jerusalem, Paul
   sent Titus to stir the members up and, with him, another brother to
   take charge of the contributions. Titus appears to have been a man of
   business capacity and strict honesty, as well as a man who could order
   the Church aright and preach the Gospel with power.

   Paul was, on one occasion, comforted by the coming of Titus. At another
   time, he was sad because Titus was not where he had hoped to meet with
   him. Though we know little about him from the Acts of the Apostles, or
   anywhere else, he appears to have been in every way one of the ablest
   of the companions of Paul--and the Apostle takes care to mention him
   over and over again in his Epistles to the Galatians and to the
   Corinthians--rendering honor to whom honor is due. It is a great pity
   when eminent men forget those who help them and it is a sad sign when
   any of us do not gratefully feel how much we owe to our coworkers. What
   can any servant of God do unless he has kind friends to bear him up by
   their prayers and their help? Paul did not forget to mention his friend
   and helper, Titus.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, in this particular verse, which I have
   chosen for my text, it seems to me that Paul has brought together five
   points in which he was one with Titus. It is a great blessing when
   Christian men are in union with each other and when they are willing to
   talk about the bonds that unite them. The more we can promote true
   unity among Christian men, the better. "First pure, then peaceable,"
   must be our motto. First, the Truth of God-- afterwards, unity in the
   Truth. We must not be content with merely contending for the faith--we
   must next fight the battles of life--and do all we can to note the
   points in which true Christians are agreed. I desire, at this time, to
   "stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance," to refresh your
   memories in regard to all the love that we have borne to one another in
   the days and years that are now past--and to exhort you to a still
   closer union in heart unto the Glory of

   God.

   There are five things in which Paul seems to me to bring out clearly
   his union with Titus. I might call them, "five links in a golden
   chain." I shall only briefly speak of each of the five and try to apply
   them to ourselves.

   I. First, Paul says of himself and Titus, that THERE WAS A CLOSE
   RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM-- "Titus, my own son."

   This was a very close relationship--not that Titus was Paul's son after
   the flesh, for there was no natural relationship between them at all.
   Probably, in the early part of their lives, they had been total
   strangers to one another. But now, Paul views Titus as his son. We
   know, Beloved, many of us, that the Grace of God creates relationships
   of a very near and tender kind, relationships which will endure through
   life, relationships which will outlast death and be, perhaps, even more
   strong and vivid in eternity than they are here! Up yonder, where they
   neither marry nor are given in marriage, I should think that the
   relationships which come of the flesh will, to a large degree, be
   merged in their celestial condition, but there, the sonship of Titus
   towards Paul is even stronger than it was when they were here below.

   How comes that sonship? It comes, often, through God blessing a
   ministry to the conversion of a soul. Henceforth, he who has spoken the
   Word with power to the heart bears to him who has heard it the
   relationship of a father to a son. There are many in this place to whom
   I stand in this most hallowed relationship. You recognize it, I know,
   and I desire to express my intense and fervent love to the many of you
   who have been born unto God by the preaching of the Word here. I do not
   know of anything that has more greatly comforted me during the last
   week or two, in the time of sharp contention for the faith, than the
   reception of so many letters from persons of whom I have never heard
   before, saying, "You do not know me, but you are my spiritual father,
   and now, at such a time of trial as this is to you, I must write and
   send you a word of good cheer." It is always a marvel to me that my
   feeble testimony should ever be blessed to the conversion of a seeking
   soul, but when I think of the hundreds and the thousands--yes, I am not
   exaggerating when I say thousands-- whom I have met with here on earth,
   and the many more, at present unknown to me, whom I hope to meet with
   either here or in Heaven, I do rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice! And I
   cannot help expressing my great love to all those who have been brought
   to the Savior by the words which I have preached and published.

   The Apostle Paul not only said of Titus that he was his son, but he
   called him his "true" son. The Revised Version correctly translates it,
   "My true child." We have, alas, some who have called us, "father," in a
   spiritual sense, of whom we have cause to be ashamed. There are
   converts and converts. There are those who say they have received the
   Word and, perhaps, they have after the poor fashion in which the brain
   can receive it, but they have never received it in the heart-- so,
   after running well, for a while, they grow weary and turn aside. And
   then the gainsayer says, "That is one of your converts!" They throw
   this in our teeth and we do not wonder that they should do so. These
   base-born ones, these who have no part nor lot in the matter, though
   they pretend to have it--these are a perpetual grief to us--a wound in
   our spirit which is hard to bear. But, oh, what a mercy it is when we
   know that many of our converts are our "true" spiritual children, in
   whom the work of repentance was deep, and whose profession of faith was
   sincere--who are not the products of free will, but the products of the
   Holy Spirit--and who bring forth fruit, not of themselves, but their
   fruit is found in Christ Jesus to whom they are eternally joined! Oh,
   those of you, between whom and myself there is this intimate
   relationship, let us feel some touch of this sacred kinship and rejoice
   before God that we feel it!

   But, Beloved, many of you are joined together by spiritual ties in
   other relationships. You, also, have been the means of bringing souls
   to Christ and there are those sitting by your side who, for that
   reason, look upon you with great love. Others of you are Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ--there is a brotherhood produced by the Christian
   life that will remain when other brotherhoods have all disappeared. An
   ungodly man may be the literal brother of a saint, but they will be
   separated in that day when there shall be weeping at the Judgment Seat
   of Christ. And they shall be eternally separated, for, though they
   seemed to be of one family, they were really of two families--the one
   an heir of wrath, the other receiving Grace to become a child of God.

   But Beloved, as many of you as believe in Jesus Christ are members of
   one family. You are related to one another in the highest possible way
   through the kinship of the spiritual life. Therefore let us now salute
   each other in the Lord. Standing or sitting in our places and without
   using any outward sign or symbol, let our hearts go out to one another
   in loving greeting. As one family we dwell in Christ, knit to one
   another by ties of sympathy, love and mutual delight, because knit to
   Christ Jesus the Lord! I want you to feel that blessed union. Let us
   make this service a sort of family gathering, as when the father stands
   up at the head of the table at Christmas time, or on New Year's Day,
   and says that he is glad to see all the family at home once more. I
   seem to stand among you, thus, not as the oldest in years, but still
   the chief official member of this Church--and I salute you all, and bid
   you rejoice together because of ties of love which time cannot loose
   and death, itself, cannot dissolve!

   II. Then the Apostle, wishing to show how real was the union between
   himself and Titus, next mentioned that THEY WERE BRETHREN BY A COMMON
   FAITH--"Titus, my true son after the common faith."

   Yes, Beloved, and our faith is also common. It is the same faith in two
   respects. First, because we believe the same truths and, secondly,
   because we believe them with "like precious faith." We who are rightly
   members of this Tabernacle Church have believed the same Truths of
   God--there is no dispute or discussion among us about the fundamentals
   of our faith. To us, there is one God--Father, Son and Holy Spirit. To
   us, there is one Mediator--Jesus Christ the Savior. We believe in the
   election of Grace by the Divine Father. We believe in the vicarious
   Sacrifice of the Eternal Son. We believe in the regenerating work of
   the Holy Spirit and in the need of it in the case of every living man,
   woman and child.

   We believe in "one Lord, one faith, one Baptism." I feel intensely
   grateful for this unity of faith. A Church divided in its
   doctrine--what can it do? If it has to spend its strength in continual
   debate! What force has it with which to conquer the world? But knowing,
   as we know, that the Scriptures are our unerring guide, that the Holy
   Spirit is the Infallible Explainer of the Scriptures, we come to one
   common fountain to learn what we are to receive, and we receive it with
   one common anointing, even the anointing of the Spirit of God!

   This unity of the faith is one of the things in which we ought
   continually to rejoice. I hope that I love all Christians, yet I cannot
   help saying that when I sit down and talk with a Brother who believes
   the Doctrines of Grace, I feel myself a great deal more at home than I
   do when I am with one who does not believe them. Where there is the
   unity of the faith, there seems to be a music which creates
   harmony--and that harmony is delightful to the renewed spirit. God
   grant, dear Friends, that none of us may err from the faith, but that
   we may be steadfast, immovable, firmly fixed in our belief of the great
   Doctrines of the Gospel, for this is the way in which we are made truly
   one!

   Then Paul says that he and Titus were one, "after the common faith,"
   that is, the one faith was believed by them in the same way. There is
   only one faith worth having. Paul calls it, in the first verse, "the
   faith of God's elect." It is real faith, cordial faith, childlike
   faith, God-given faith! It is not a faith that springs out of human
   nature unaided by the Holy Spirit, but it is precious faith--faith
   which is the gift of God and the work of the Holy Spirit! Now, if we
   believe only intellectually, we do not enter into sympathy with one
   another as we do when we both believe spiritually, with heart and soul,
   from the very depths of our being.

   Beloved, I trust that I can say of myself and of you, also, that we
   have received faith as a gift from God. Here, then, is another sacred
   tie binding us together. You have that jewel of faith gleaming on your
   bosom and here are others who have the same precious gem--and by that
   very fact you are drawn to each other. Your faith and my faith, if they
   are both true faith, are, "the common faith." I may have very little
   faith and you may have the full assurance of understanding, but your
   faith and mine are of the same sort. Your faith may be but as a grain
   of mustard seed and your friend's faith may have grown into a tree, but
   it is the same faith--it clings to the same Christ and will produce the
   same eternal results in the salvation of the soul! Come, then, let us
   spiritually shake hands, again, over this second point. First, we are
   closely related to one another. Secondly, we possess a common faith,
   which is a wonderful bond of union between us.

   III. Carefully note the third link. It is this--WE HAVE A MUTUAL
   BENEDICTION, for Paul wishes for Titus,

   "Grace, mercy and peace." This is just what Titus would have wished for
   Paul if he had been sending him a benediction! And I wish to you,
   Beloved, "Grace, mercy and peace," and I think you are, in your hearts,
   wishing for me, also, "Grace, mercy, and peace." We all alike need
   these three choice favors!

   First, we need "Grace" to help. I know how it is with the weak
   Believer--he sees some brave Christian doing mighty works for God and
   he says, "Oh, I wish that I were like he is! Oh, that I were as strong
   as he is!" And he gets the notion that this more prominent worker has
   no fainting fits or weaknesses such as he has. Oh, no--he supposes that
   his Brother's head is bathed in everlasting sunshine and that his heart
   is continually flooded with rivers of delight! That shows, my Friend,
   that you are greatly mistaken, for the most eminent saint has no more
   Grace to give away than the least in the family of God has! I sometimes
   wish that I could rid the minds of our dear trembling friends, Miss
   Much-Afraid and Mr. Despondency, of the ideas they have concerning some
   of us to whom they look up with esteem. I am not going to let you into
   all our secrets, but, believe me, our heads ache as much as yours and
   our eyes are sometimes as wet with tears as ever yours are! Yes, and
   our hearts get quite as heavy as yours do.

   "Yes," you say, "very likely, but then, somehow or other, you are
   stronger than we are." Just so, but suppose you have to carry 50 pounds
   and you can carry that and no more? Well, you have strength enough for
   your task. If another man has to carry 100 pounds and he can just carry
   that, and no more, he is in exactly the same condition as you are! Here
   is a Brother who has a large measure full of manna which he is carrying
   for the supply of his family. Here is another who has quite a small
   measure and, as he carries it into his tent, he says to himself, "Oh, I
   wish that I had that great bushel of manna that my Brother took into
   his tent just now." Yes, but listen--"he that gathered much had nothing
   over, and he that gathered little had no lack." Mark you, I do not
   discourage the attempt to gather much Grace, I would urge you to get
   all you can of it, for, however much you gather, you will have none too
   much, but I would discourage your despair if there should seem to be
   but little falling to your share, for you shall have no need! The fact
   is, all of us need Grace. You who preach the Gospel, you who are
   deacons, you who are elders, you who teach the infant class, you who
   can only give away a tract--you must do all these works with Grace or
   else you will not really do them at all! And our need of Grace is a
   common meeting place for us all. Only Grace can save you and only Grace
   can save me--and the Grace of God shall be given to us and all
   Believers as we have need of it.

   Our next need is, "mercy" to forgive. Titus, perhaps, thought to
   himself, "Well, Paul wishes mercy for me, but can hardly wish it for
   himself, for he is such an eminent servant of God, so holy, so
   consecrated, so zealous, so self-denying that he does not need mercy."
   I reminded you, in our reading, that Paul, in writing to a Church,
   says, "Grace be to you, and peace," but when he writes to a minister,
   he says, "Grace, mercy and peace." It looks as though ministers needed
   more mercy than their people did! And it is my firm conviction that the
   more eminent is their office and the more remarkable is their
   usefulness in the service of God, the more mercy they require!
   Brothers, how can we meet our responsibilities unless we constantly
   cry, "Lord, have mercy upon us"? How can we deal faithfully with the
   souls committed to our charge and be clear of the blood of all men,
   unless the Lord shall have mercy upon us, and upon us beyond all
   others?

   All of us, then, need mercy. I do. Do not you? You are only a plain man
   with a family growing up around you, but you need mercy for your sins
   as the head of the household. Perhaps you are only a domestic servant,
   my Sister, but you need mercy even in that humble calling of yours.
   You, perhaps, dear Friend, are very rich--oh, you need much mercy! And
   you, on the other hand, are very poor--I am sure that you need mercy.
   Some of you are in good health. You need mercy lest you should pervert
   that strength to an evil purpose. Others of you are very sickly--you
   may well cry for mercy, that you may bear up under your many pains and
   depressions of spirit. We all need mercy. So that is another point in
   which we are one.

   The third word of the benediction is "peace" to comfort. I hope that
   many of us know what peace of conscience means, what peace with God
   means and what peace with man means. If God has given us His peace, it
   is a treasure of untold value, "the pearl of great price." To be at
   peace with God is better than to be a millionaire, or Czar of all the
   Rus-sias. Peace of mind, restfulness of heart, quiet of spirit,
   deliverance from care, from quarrelling, from complaining--I know that
   I need that kind of peace--and you need it, too, do you not? You need
   it in your family, in your business, in your own hearts! Well, then,
   here we meet, again, having this same need of peace and, when we get
   it, we meet once more in finding the same delicious enjoyment of it! I
   wish to you, Beloved, now and henceforth, Grace, mercy and peace! And I
   believe that you wish the same to me. And herein, again, we join our
   hands and bless God that we feel true union of heart.

   IV. Upon the next part of my subject, which is more weighty, still, I
   must say but little. It is this--"Grace, mercy and peace, from God the
   Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." That is, WE ARE ONE IN THE SOURCE OF
   EVERY BLESSING.

   All good comes to us from God the Father through the one Mediator, the
   Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. I love to think of this--that all the
   Grace, mercy and peace that come to you--and all the Grace, mercy and
   peace that come to me, come from the heart of God! How many wagons
   there are upon the road of Grace and all of them heavily laden! One
   stops at that Brother's door and another waits at this Sister's gate,
   but they all started from one spot. Look on the side of the wagons and
   you will see the name of the same Proprietor on every one of them! "The
   chariots of God are twenty thousand," but they are all the Lord's, so
   that whatever Grace, mercy and peace come to us at all, come from the
   same place! Get to the very foundation of this Truth of God and you
   will see that we who believe all eat bread baked in the same oven, our
   clothes come out of the same wardrobe, the water that we drink comes
   from the same Rock! Yes, and the shoes that we wear were made by the
   same mighty Worker who bade Moses say to Israel of old, "Your shoes
   shall be iron and brass; and as your days, so shall your strength be."
   You have not anything that is worth having but what your Father gave to
   you! And your Father is my Father--and the hand that passes the
   blessing to you passes the blessing to me and to the whole family of
   Believers!

   These blessings not only all come from the same source, but they all
   come by the same channel--"the Lord Jesus Christ." There is the sacred
   blood mark on every Covenant blessing, whether you have it, or your
   Brother has it, or some Christian far away in India gets it. It all
   comes by the same Divinely-appointed Channel--the Man, the God, Christ
   Jesus our Lord! I do not know how you feel about this matter, but it
   seems to me as if this ought to bind us very closely together. I
   remember when I first left my grandfather, with whom I had been brought
   up as a little child, how grieved I was to part from him. It was the
   great sorrow of my little life. Grandfather seemed very sorry, too, and
   we had a cry together. He did not quite know what to say to me, but he
   said, "Now child, tonight, when the moon shines and you look at it,
   don't forget that it is the same moon your grandfather will be looking
   at." And for years, as a child, I used to love the moon because I
   thought that my grandfather's eyes and my own somehow met there on the
   moon! How much better it is to think that you, dear Friend, going so
   far away to Australia, are looking to the Savior, while we are doing
   the same thing, here, and so our eyes meet! You go to God at the Mercy
   Seat in prayer and that is just where we go--so, after all, we pray at
   the same sacred spot and our petitions meet at the great Throne of
   Mercy! Thus we are made to feel our blessed union in Christ.

   Some people say that they try to remember other people, but if you
   really love them, you will not "try" to remember them--you will not be
   able to keep from remembering them! Their image will come up before
   your mind's eye. You cannot avoid it and you will not wish to avoid it.
   So, dear Friends, we will not say that we will try to remember each
   other while we are parted a while--but every blessing that comes to us
   shall remind us that it comes from our Father, through Jesus Christ our
   Mediator--and so we shall feel that we are truly one.

   V. Then, to close, there is one more point of union and that lies in
   OUR COMMON RELATIONSHIP TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. See how Paul puts it,
   "The Lord Jesus Christ our Savior."

   I must dwell briefly upon every word of this title. First, Jesus is
   Lord to all His people--and equally to be obeyed by them all, and
   adored by them all. It is important that, with bowed knee and reverent
   love, we call Him Lord and God. We put our finger into the print of the
   nails and the wound in His side, confessing that He is and must be real
   Man, but, at the same moment, we cry with Thomas, "My Lord and my God."
   I cannot pretend to have any union with the man who cannot, from his
   heart, say that! If you do not count Christ to be God, well, go your
   way, my fellow man, and I will go mine--but your way and my way cannot
   be the same. We know that this is the Christ of God, and he who does
   not know it needs to be taught of God the very first principles of the
   Gospel. So, you see, we have a true unity in the Lordship of Christ--we
   desire, as one man, to be obedient to all His commands and to worship
   Him as "very God of very God."

   Then comes the next word, "the Lord Jesus Christ." That will come again
   when I speak of the word, "Savior," so I pass on to the following word,
   "the Lord Jesus Christ." He is, to all of us who believe, the Anointed
   One, so anointed that every Word that Jesus Christ has spoken is to us
   Infallibly Inspired. We believe in Jesus, not only as men say they do,
   today, but we really believe in Jesus, for we believe in His Doctrine,
   in that which He, Himself spoke, and in that which He spoke by His
   Inspired Apostles. We cannot separate between Christ and the Truth He
   came to preach, and the work He came to do--nor will we attempt to do
   so. He is to us the Anointed of God, as Prophet, Priest and King--and
   we accept Him in all the offices for which He bears that anointing, do
   we not, my Brothers and Sisters? I know that we do! As Brothers and
   Sisters in one common faith, we rejoice in the common Christ whose
   anointing has fallen upon us, too. Though we are but as the skirts of
   the garment of our Great High Priest, yet the holy oil upon His head
   has come down even to us, as it is written, "you have an unction from
   the Holy One."

   The Apostle further writes, "The Lord Jesus Christ our Savior."
   Sometimes, in the Bible, we find the Lord Jesus Christ called, "a
   Savior." "Unto you is born in the city of David a Savior, which is
   Christ the Lord." That is good, but it is not good enough for what poor
   sinners need. Our Lord Jesus Christ is not a Savior among other
   saviors, though He does instrumentally make His people saviors, as it
   is written, "saviors shall come up on Mount Zion; and happy are they
   who, as instruments in His hands, save souls from death, and hide
   multitudes of sins." But Jesus is also called "the Savior." He is "the
   Savior of all men, specially of those that believe"--the Savior,par
   excellence.

   Then, next, He is my Savior, as Mary sang, "My spirit has rejoiced in
   God my Savior." Oh, that is sweet, indeed--to get a personal grip of
   Him and to know that He has saved me from despair, from sin, from the
   power of evil, from death, from Hell! But there is, in some respects, a
   superior sweetness in this plural pronoun, "our Savior." Selfishness is
   gone when we come to feel an intense delight in this Truth of God--that
   the Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior of many more beside ourselves. "Our
   Savior"--does not this bind us to one another? A common delight in one
   person is one of the strongest bands of sympathetic union that can bind
   men together--and a common obligation to some one superior Being
   becomes a great reason for our being knit together in love. My Savior,
   your Savior, our Savior--"The Lord Jesus Christ our Savior." Whenever
   we feel any disposition to break off from this Brother and from that,
   whom we know to be, after all, saved in the Lord, let us come together
   with a fresh clasp of the hands as we say to one another, "We rejoice
   in our Savior and we are one in Him."

   What I want to say--as a parting word, before I leave you once more for
   my season of rest--is just this. Let us keep close together, now,
   shoulder to shoulder, if ever we did so in all our lives. "Close your
   ranks!" must be the message to the faithful in these evil days. Let us
   feel heart touching heart in the deepest and truest Christian
   affection, for, in proportion as we are welded together in love, we
   shall be strong for all the practical purposes for which the Holy
   Spirit intends a Church to be used.

   These 34 years--is not that the number?--they are so many, I begin to
   forget the number--a third of a century have I served among you as a
   preacher of the Gospel! I am always fearing that I shall get "flat,
   stale and unprofitable," and that my voice will cease to have any music
   for you, but there is one thing I know, from the first day I came among
   you until now, I have preached nothing but "the glorious Gospel of the
   blessed God!" "Jesus Christ and Him Crucified!" And I am not afraid
   that that Gospel will ever get "flat, stale, or unprofitable." And this
   is the golden chain which has bound us together in holy fellowship.
   This is the foundation on which we have built--"One Lord, one faith,
   one Baptism." Yes, one Baptism--there are others who hold another
   baptism, but we know of no outward baptism but the immersion of the
   Believer into the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit! And
   upon this point we are all agreed, as we are upon the rest of the
   articles of our faith.

   So, being one, let us show to all the world what the power of Christian
   unity really is! Keep together in the Prayer Meetings. Never let those
   precious gatherings decay or drop. If you have come together in large
   numbers--and you have in my presence--do so much more in my absence.
   Let each one feel bound to meet with his Brothers and Sisters in
   prayer. I am longing for a genuine revival of religion--a revival of
   religion everywhere--and I think I can see signs that it is coming. I
   find that many of the Baptist ministers who love the Gospel are going
   over the groundwork, preaching the fundamental doctrines more than they
   ever did --that is a good thing. I find that the Churches are meeting
   together for prayer at this juncture more than they have done, seeking
   that God will help and guide them to be faithful--that also is a good
   thing.

   And people are talking about the plan of salvation--on the tops of
   omnibuses and in the railway carriages-- everywhere it comes up as a
   subject of debate! In the daily papers the same theme is brought
   forward, for which I thank God. And though I have had to bear my share
   of reproach for the Truth's sake, yet I joyfully accept it. Anything
   which can call public attention to the Gospel of Christ is a help to us
   and I believe that the attention called to this question is hopeful,
   that the discussion of it by so many is still more hopeful and that the
   firm adherence to the faith, which I see in so many, will be attended
   by an intense zeal for the conversion of souls--and then we shall see a
   revival. God has been hindered and hampered by the false doctrine and
   heresy that have been cherished in so many of the churches--and the
   Spirit of God has been grieved and driven away by the utter rottenness
   of worldliness that has been indulged in by so many professing
   Christians. By God's Grace we have let a little light into this
   darkness. By God's Grace we have opened a door, here and there, and a
   clear cold draft is blowing out some of the fog and the evil gases of
   the stagnant atmosphere that has been poisoning our people far too
   long.

   Now is our time, Brothers and Sisters! Let us, as one man, pray God to
   send this benediction from on high-- "Grace, mercy and peace." I charge
   you, while I am away, to be instant in and out of season about this
   matter and to let this be a special object of supplication with the
   members of this Church--that we should have a revival of religion here,
   at any rate, while the pastor is away. It is better for it to come
   while he is away, for nobody will then put the credit of it upon any
   instrument. Break out, heavenly fire! Descend! Descend! Descend! Let
   the sacrifice be consumed!

   As for you who do not know and love the Lord, we love you, we desire to
   bring you into the blessed circle of love by the door of faith in
   Christ. Look alone to Jesus Christ, who is the only way of salvation
   for you as for us. Oh, that you would look to Him and live! God grant
   it, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: TITUS1; 2

   While reading this chapter we must understand that Titus was sent to
   Crete to superintend the preaching of the Gospel throughout that
   island. Crete was, at that time, inhabited by a people who were only
   partially civilized, and sunk in the very worst of vices. Paul,
   therefore, tells Titus to speak to them about things which would hardly
   be mentioned to Christians nowadays.

   Titus 1:1-4. Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ,
   according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the
   truth which is after godliness; in hope of eternal life, which God,
   that cannot lie, promised before the world began; but has in due times
   manifested His Word through preaching, which is committed unto me
   according to the commandment of God our Savior; to Titus, my own son
   after the common faith: Grace, mercy and peace, from God the Father and
   the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. You have probably noticed that Paul's
   benediction, when he is writing to a minister, is always. "Grace, mercy
   and peace." Writing to Churches, his usual formula is, "Grace be to you
   and peace," but God's servants, called to the work of the ministry,
   need very special "mercy"--as if the higher the office, the greater the
   liability to sin and, therefore, in his Pastoral Epistles, whether he
   is addressing Titus or Timothy, Paul wishes for his sons in the faith,
   "Grace, mercy and peace." Oh, what a mercy it will be for any of us
   ministers if, at the last, we are clear of the blood of all men! If,
   having been called to preach the Gospel, we shall do it so faithfully
   as to be acquitted and even rewarded by our Lord and Master, it will be
   mercy upon mercy! [This "charge" of the beloved Pastor has even more
   force and pathos now that he has gone "away" to Heaven.]

   5, 6. For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order
   the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had
   appointed you: if any are blameless, the husband of one wife. For there
   were many converts, there, who had two or three wives. Whatever
   position they might be permitted to occupy in the Church, they could
   not become offi-cers--they must keep in the rear rank.

   6-12. Having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a
   bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not
   soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
   but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
   temperate; holding fast the faithful Word as he has been taught, that
   he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the
   gainsayers. For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
   specially they of the circumcision: whose mouths must be stopped, who
   subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy
   lucre's sake. One of themselves, even a prophet of their own. According
   to Jerome, this was Epimenides, a prophet-poet who lived in Crete in
   the sixth century before Christ.

   12. Said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. They
   were a degraded people and, therefore, those who would teach them had a
   most difficult task and needed great Grace. Paul exhorts Titus that
   only specially fit men-- men whose example would have influence and
   whose characters would have weight--should be allowed to be elders in
   such Churches.

   13-16. This witness is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they
   may be sound in the faith; not giving heed to Jewish fables, and
   commandments of men that turn from the truth. Unto the pure all things
   are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing
   pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. They profess that
   they know God; but in works they deny Him, being abominable, and
   disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. This was bad soil, but
   it had to be plowed, sown and, with an Almighty God at the back of the
   Gospel plower and sower, a fruitful harvest came even in Crete! We need
   not be afraid of the adaptation of the Gospel to the lowest of the low.
   If there is any quarter of the town where the people are more sunken in
   vice than anywhere else, there the Gospel is to be carried with more
   prayer and more faith than anywhere else! Depend upon it, God can bless
   His Word anywhere--among Cretans or among any other sort of degraded
   people.

   Titus 2:1. But speak you the things which become sound doctrine. There
   are certain things which are suitable to go with sound doctrine--they
   are meet and fit and appropriate thereto.

   2. That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
   charity, in patience. Among the heathen, old men often gave themselves
   up to drunkenness and gluttony. So, now, this is the teaching that is
   to be given to aged Christian men. They need faith, love and patience,
   as well as the virtues of sobriety, gravity and temperance! The
   infirmities of old age often create petulance, so the Grace of God is
   to make the venerable Christian to be full of faith, love and patience.

   3. The aged women, likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes
   holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
   things. Old women also among the heathen were often addicted to the
   taking of much wine, so here they are cautioned against it by the
   Spirit of God. They are also tempted to spread slanderous reports
   against people--having little to do in their old age, they are apt to
   do that little by way of mischief--so they are warned that they are not
   to be "false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
   things." And how beautifully can an aged Christian woman, by her kindly
   example, be a teacher of good things! There is no more charming sight
   under Heaven, I think, than that of an elderly Christian lady whose
   words and whose whole life are such as becomes the Gospel of Christ.

   4, 5. That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
   husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at
   home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the Word of God be not
   blasphemed. There were some women who supposed that the moment they
   became Christians, they were to run about everywhere. "No," says the
   Apostle, "let them stay at home." There is no gain to the Christian
   Church when the love, the industry and the zeal, which ought to make a
   happy home, are squandered upon something else. The young women of
   Crete appear to have been such that they needed to be taught "to love
   their husbands." That expression does not occur elsewhere in Scripture.
   Christian women do not need to be told to love their husbands, but
   these Cretans, just brought out of the slough of sin, had to be taught
   even this lesson. Oh, what a blessing is love in the marriage
   relationship! And what a gracious influence love has upon children! How
   are they to be brought up aright except the whole house be perfumed
   with love?

   6. Young men, likewise, exhort to be sober-minded. That exhortation is
   as necessary in London as it was in Crete! Young men often know a great
   deal, or think they do--and they are very apt to be intoxicated with
   the idea of knowing so much and being able to do so much--so that the
   exhortation to them is to "be sober-minded."

   7-9. In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in
   doctrine showing incorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that
   cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be
   ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. Exhort servants--Or, as it
   might and should be rendered, "bond-slaves."

   9, 10. To be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well
   in all things; not answering again; not purloining. Not picking and
   stealing, which very naturally was the common habit of slaves--and who
   wonders at it in their wretched condition?

   10. But showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of
   God our Savior in all things. Is not that a wonderful passage? Here is
   a slave, able to be an ornament to the Gospel of Christ! This blessed
   Gospel is not sent only to kings and princes! When Paul preached it,
   the great mass of the population were in cruel bondage, treated like
   dogs, or even worse. Yet the Gospel even had a message for them--it
   told them that they might, by a godly character, adorn the doctrine of
   God, their Savior!

   11-15. For the Grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all
   men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should
   live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world; looking for
   that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
   Savior Jesus Christ; who gave Himselffor us, that He might redeem us
   from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous
   of good works. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all
   authority. Let no man despise you.

Faithful Stewardship

   (No. 2440)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   14, 1887.

   "Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful." 1
   Corinthians 4:2.

   IT is well that our dear Brothers and Sisters should make a right
   account of us. Paul says, in the verse preceding our text, "Let a man
   so think of us," for there are some who make a wrong reckoning as to
   the ministers of the Gospel. Some go to an extreme, for they glory in
   men. One glories in Paul, who is so deep in doctrine, another in
   Cephas, who is so energetic and plainspoken, another in Apollos, who is
   so exceedingly eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures. But Paul says, in
   the latter verses of the third chapter, "Let no man glory in men. For
   all things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the
   world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
   yours; and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's." You do not belong to
   your ministers, you must not put yourselves down as followers of
   them--you belong to Christ and Christ, Himself--and all His ministers
   belong to you.

   But while some erred in thinking too much of their ministers, as no
   doubt they still do--God deliver them from such a delusion--there were,
   no doubt, others who erred in not thinking enough of them, not
   appreciating their position and condition so as to sympathize with them
   and pray for them. Had they known to what a responsible office they
   were called and what was required at their hands, they would lovingly
   have borne them upon their hearts, and gone with their names to the
   Mercy Seat in continual prayer. Hence, it is very important that men
   should so think of us as to judge us correctly, so that while they do
   not rely upon us in any wrong sense, they may, at the same time, feel
   an affectionate sympathy with us and constantly bear us up before the
   Throne of Grace.

   Paul goes on to tell us how we ought to think of the ministers of
   Christ. The word should be, "servants," of Christ. There is a great
   respectability about the word, "minister," which really does not belong
   to it, for, if you take it to pieces, it means an under-rower, one of
   those men who had to take an oar on the lowest benches of the slave
   ships. There were three benches for the rowers and it was a hard task
   for all who were at the oars--but to the under-rowers, who had to bend
   to their work in the most trying position as they sent the galley
   flying through the water, it was stern toil, indeed! Now, God's
   ministers, if they act as they should, are under-rowers of Christ. They
   are tugging away at a very heavy oar and they may well ask you to pray
   that as they use up their strength, fresh force may be imparted to them
   from the God of All Power, that they may not labor in vain, nor spend
   their strength for nothing!

   We ask men, therefore, to think of us as servants, not as masters. The
   word, "bishop," has come to have a wonderful significance about it
   which is not in the least degree Scriptural. We are simply to be
   shepherds of the sheep--and a shepherd is no great lord. He is the
   servant of all the sheep and though he leads them, it is by going
   first, taking the brunt of all that comes, and finding out the best
   places for them to feed and to rest. Let a man so think of us as
   servants, but not merely as servants to the Church, certainly not as
   servants to men, but as servants of Christ! That is our honor as
   ministers--we serve the Lord Jesus Christ--the best of Masters! But, as
   He deserves to have the best of servants, the responsibility of the
   position weighs down the honor attached to it. Oh, if they who serve
   men should serve them faithfully, how much more should they be found
   faithful who are the servants of Christ!

   Then the Apostle adds that men are to think of us as stewards. And it
   is about that office that I am going to speak to you--"It is required
   in stewards, that a man be found faithful." Although my text, no doubt,
   refers, in the first place, to those who labor in word and doctrine, to
   whom it is a life's vocation, yet all the people of God are stewards,
   and each child of God, in his own way and in his own place, should
   reckon that whatever gift he has should be used for the Lord Jesus

   Christ, and laid out for Him. And he should also remember that he is
   made one of the Lord's stewards and that it is required of him that he
   be found faithful. And I may even add that every unconverted man has a
   stewardship to fulfill. As God's creature, he is bound to be God's
   servant--and at the Last Great Day he will have to give an account of
   every opportunity and capacity for service which God has given to him!
   And woe unto him if he is found an unfaithful steward in the day of his
   Lord's reckoning!

   If I should seem to speak rather more about ministers than about
   anybody else, I will ask you kindly to pick out all that belongs to
   yourselves, you who are private Christians, and you who are not
   Christians at all. I pray the Lord to make use of what I say to myself
   and then to you who are His people--and to those, also, who are not His
   people--that they may be pricked to the heart and made to feel how
   ungenerously they have acted towards the great Lord of the house. To
   begin, then, I will first ask--how are we stewards? Secondly, if
   stewards, how are we to behave? Next, how are we in danger of
   misbehaving? And, lastly, what will be the result of right behavior or
   of misbehavior in those who are stewards?

   I. First, then, HOW ARE WE STEWARDS?

   Well, God's ministers are stewards, first, as appointed to look after
   other servants. You know, dear Friend, if you are a servant, you have
   enough to do to mind your own work. But if you happen to be an upper
   servant, such as a steward is, you have not only your own work to mind,
   but it is a part of your own work to look after the work of other
   people. There are some who are so foolish that they look only at the
   honor of this position, whereas, if they were wise, they would look
   more at the responsibility of it. Brothers and Sisters, if I had my
   choice, I would rather look after a horse than look after a man! The
   second is much the more difficult animal to manage! And to look after
   many men--oh, this is, indeed, a difficult task!

   I had an old friend, who was, for 40 years, a shepherd, and after that
   he became a minister--and he lived to be 40 years a shepherd in a
   spiritual sense. I asked him, once, "Which was the easier flock to
   manage?" "Oh!," he replied, "the second flock of sheep was a deal more
   sheepish than the first." I understood what he meant. They say that
   sheep have as many diseases as there are days in the year. Yes, but men
   have as many complaints as there are minutes in the year! It is not
   long that they are free from one malady or another! I mean, men and
   women--all those that belong to the spiritual flock of which the
   minister is the shepherd--there is a certain form of trouble arising
   out of each one. True, there is a certain amount of comfort and joy
   arising out of every Christian, but there is a measure of difficulty
   that must come to the steward from everyone of his fellow servants. It
   is by no means a position which any man who understands it might desire
   for himself! The real steward is one who has been appointed to the
   position--and if he is not appointed, why, he has no right to be a
   steward at all! It is the great Master of the house who calls this one
   or that one to look after the other servants--and it is from this
   calling that he has the right to interfere in any respect with them.

   Next, notice that the servants of God--whether called ministers or
   not--those who are really so, are stewards because they are under the
   Master's near command. An ordinary servant in God's house may take his
   orders from the steward, but the steward takes no orders from anybody
   but the Master and, therefore, he is in an evil case and the household
   is in an evil case, too, if he does not often resort to the Master--if
   he does not distinctly recognize his position as an underling of his
   Master--and if he does not so keep up his daily fellowship with the
   Master that he, himself, knows the Master's mind and is able to
   communicate it to his fellow servants.

   There are many of you, dear Friends, who have around you your children,
   your servants, your fellow workers. Well, in that respect, you are a
   steward to them--they have to do a good deal that you tell them. Then
   do, I pray you--and I speak this to myself as well as to you--let us
   wait upon the Master! Let us come forth to speak to our fellow
   servants, not our own words, but the words of Him who is Master and
   Lord to the whole household! How beautifully Jesus, the greatest of all
   stewards, did this! How constantly He said, "The words that I speak
   unto you I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwells in Me, He
   does the works." He was always referring those who were His brethren
   back to the great Head of the family--and He did not speak without His
   Father's authority. Having taken up the position of a subordinate in
   order to work out our redemption, He continually declared that He was
   His Father's servant.

   It is an ill day for us when we begin to think that our thoughts are to
   be given out in the house instead of the Master's thoughts! It is not
   for us to deliver our own speculations, but to go straight away to the
   Word of God and, by the teaching of the indwelling Spirit, to come
   forth to the people with what we have received--not what we have
   invented!

   You shall find no power, my Brothers and Sisters, in doing Christian
   work unless you keep on doing it as receiving your mission and
   commission from the great Lord of All!

   I recollect how McCheyne says, "It is God's Word that saves, not our
   comment on God's Word." And I am sure that it is so. It is God at the
   back of the steward who blesses all in the household. But when the
   steward does not go to the Master and get his orders from Him, he soon
   puts everything into confusion. He loses his own standing and he is apt
   to do desperate mischief to all who are round about him.

   Then, the true steward is called upon to give an account--and if he
   does it often, so much the better! I am persuaded that, in the things
   of God as well as between man and man, "short reckonings make long
   friends," and if we will often go to our Master with our service and
   present it to Him, and overhaul it under His Divine Guidance,
   confessing our shortcomings and blessing Him for every particle of
   success that has attended it, we shall do much better than if we go on
   for a long stretch without a reference to Him. Brothers and Sisters,
   you who are teaching your classes of boys or girls, bring your Sunday
   work to the Lord at the end of the Sabbath! And when we have finished a
   sermon, those of us who stand up to preach, let us not be satisfied
   until we have brought that piece of our work under our Master's eyes. I
   am sure that if the steward can get to the side of his Master every
   evening, or every morning say to Him, "We did such and such yesterday,
   and there is such and such which we propose to do today," that is the
   way for the house to be well-ordered! Things go right when there is no
   absentee landlord, but when the great Master is always close at hand
   and the steward constantly goes to Him with an account of all his work!

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, let us constantly do this! We do not live
   near enough to God, do we? I know that some of you wait upon Him day
   and night and you abide under the shadow of the Almighty, but I fear
   that there are some workers who forget to do this. We should work with
   the hands of Martha, but yet keep near the Master with the heart of
   Mary! We need a combination of activity and meditation. When we get
   that--when we inwardly retire for consultation with our Lord and then
   come out actively to labor for our Lord--then shall we be good stewards
   in the little part of the great house with which He has entrusted us.

   Further, a steward is a man who is put in trust with his master's
   goods. This is the main point of his stewardship-- nothing is his
   own--it is all his master's. When he begins to open an account of his
   own, it is wonderful how apt he is to mistake what is his master's and
   to call it his own and, by-and-by, he gets into a muddle and cannot
   distinguish his master's accounts from his own. Oh, it is a glorious
   thing when you have not any, "own"--when you do not live for yourself
   at all, but wholly for Christ! Then you will not make any blunders!
   There will not be any of Christ's property getting into your cash
   account, so that you will have a difficulty in disentangling it. "No
   man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life," for he
   can say--

   "'Tis done, the great transaction's done, I am my Lord's,"

   "and all the business I have here below is His. I have no sub-ends or
   secondary objectives, but all I have and am is for Him." Then it is
   easy to keep our accounts and to make no mistakes in them.

   The true steward is put in trust with his master's property, first, to
   protect it. Oh, with what earnestness ought we to guard the Gospel of
   Christ! With what holy valor ought we to contend earnestly for the
   faith once and for all delivered to the saints! "Hold fast the form of
   sound words," wrote Paul to Timothy--not only the words, but the
   particular form of them which the Apostle had delivered! Not merely
   sound doctrine, but the very words in which those doctrines had been
   made to take shape! The true steward is to defend his master's treasure
   with his very life. The Lord has put us in trust with the Gospel--and
   all the people of God, in their measure--have also become trustees of
   those inestimably precious doctrines wherein will be found the Glory of
   God and the salvation of the sons of men! So we are to defend our
   Master's property.

   And next, we are to dispense it. It is the steward who provides for the
   table of the household. He brings out of that treasury things new and
   old. He never forgets, when the table is spread, to put the bread and
   the salt on it. The bread is Christ, Himself, on which we feed. And the
   salt is the Grace of which we cannot have too much. The true steward
   does not starve the children, but he sees that each one is fed with
   convenient food. To one he brings milk, for he is a babe. To another,
   he gives strong meat, for he is a man who has had his senses exercised
   to discern between good and evil. The steward keeps his master's stores
   and sees that they are not wasted--but he also takes care to magnify
   his master's liberality by seeing that none of the household know any
   need.

   I have known some who pretended to be stewards of Christ who evidently
   did not understand the business. There was an old fable of a man who
   gave bones to the sheep and grass to the dogs, but neither of them did
   well on such fare. And some preaching seems to me just like that! The
   preacher assumes, in his opening prayer, that all his hearers are
   converted, and the whole service goes on as if everybody was a
   Christian! And yet, if you listen carefully, you will hear that there
   is an undertone implying that nobody is really saved and that everybody
   is saved in imagination. Brothers, if we cannot discern between the
   righteous and the wicked, we shall never be as God's mouth to our
   hearers! If we have not a javelin for God's foes, as well as butter in
   a lordly dish for His friends, He will never make use of us as stewards
   in His house. There is much Grace needed in the dispensing of our
   Master's goods--the rightly dividing of the Word of God--and bringing
   out every Truth of God in due proportion and in due season,

   These are two parts of the steward's business--to protect his master's
   property and to dispense it.

   Besides this, he is to use his master's property for his master's
   benefit. The goods entrusted to him are to be put out to interest, or
   used in business to bring in profit for his master. I trust that there
   are many of us here present who are using the Gospel for the glory of
   Christ. What little we know, we try to proclaim, that sinners may be
   converted and that the Savior may be glorified. It is a wonderful thing
   for us to have the Bible, is it not? But oh, to use the Bible every day
   so as to bring Glory to God! It is a good thing even to be a
   tract-distributor, or to do the least service in the Kingdom of Christ,
   but the one point for us to aim at is to do it so that the profit of it
   may come, not to us, but to our Master! The steward must not get to
   trading on his own account. As I have said before, if he does that,
   there is apt to be a lot of mistakes made in the reckoning! Everything
   that the steward does is for his master.

   Abraham said, "The steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus,"
   and Abraham trusted him to go and find a wife for Isaac. So does our
   Lord use us and trust us, as His stewards. Our great God trusts us to
   go and find a spouse for Christ--and our business is to go and discover
   her, to find her out and ask her to come with us that she may be joined
   to that blessed Lord of All, the Son of the Great Father, to whom He
   has left the inheritance. Happy are we, when, like the steward of
   Abraham, we can bring back the beloved one for our Master's Son! This
   is a part of our work, to make use of everything that the Master
   entrusts to us for His own dear Son and to look upon the Church with
   which we have to deal as the bride we are to bring to Jesus, that she
   may be married to Him forever.

   I will say no more upon the first part of my subject except this--a
   steward is charged with the general care of the family. He has not
   merely to look after the stores, but he has to take care of all the
   family. The steward of the olden times used to reckon all that belonged
   to his master as if it were his own--and he got into the habit of
   talking of it in that way. His Lordship once asked his steward, "What
   is that coming up the drive?" "Oh," he answered, "it is our horse and
   carriage, my Lord." "Our horse and carriage?" exclaimed the nobleman,
   "and who may be in it?" "Oh, my Lord," replied the faithful servant,
   "it is our wife and children!"

   Exactly so--the man had come to look upon everything that belonged to
   his master as belonging to himself--and that is the spirit which our
   Lord would have us cultivate! Those children of His, they are our
   children. Those that are newly converted to God, oh, they are
   especially ours and we love them dearly! And this great Church--well,
   it is a bride to us even as it is to Christ. Our whole life is given up
   to the blessed service to which Christ has given up Himself. Oh, that
   we could come anywhere near to this ideal of what a true steward should
   be! God help us to do so!

   II. Our second enquiry is "HOW ARE WE WHO ARE STEWARDS TO BEHAVE?" Our
   text supplies the answer-- "Moreover it is required in stewards, that a
   man be found faithful."

   Note, the Apostle does not say, "it is required in stewards, that a man
   be found brilliant." No minister will be blamed if he does not prove to
   be brilliant, nor even if he should not be successful. We shall not be
   condemned even if the seed does not spring up, provided that we sow it.
   You are responsible, not for the result of what you do, but for doing
   it honestly, sincerely, devoutly, prayerfully, believingly. I do not
   think that in such a case you will be unsuccessful-- certainly not as
   God judges success. Still, the Apostle's point is that "it is required
   in stewards, that a man be found faithful." What, then, should each one
   of us be with regard to faithfulness?

   First, faithful to our Master. Oh, whatever we do, let us not be
   traitors to Him! Let us not be apparently doing His work, yet not
   really doing it. Let us not be preaching without praying. Let us not be
   talking about doing good without always trusting in Him without whom
   nothing can be good, or strong, or right! O God, may we, each of us, be
   able to say at the last, "I am clear of the blood of all men"! If we
   have dealt truly with our Master, if we can feel that we are sincerely
   seeking not our own glory, but His Glory, and working not for men, but
   for Him alone, it is well with us.

   Next, we must each one be faithful to our office, whatever that office
   may be. If you, as stewards of Christ, are called to be ministers, be
   faithful to your ministry. If you are called to have substance, and to
   give it away, give it with cheerfulness and be faithful in your office.
   If you are called to teach half-a-dozen children, and no more, it is
   quite enough to give an account for at the last--so be faithful to your
   office. Do not run about finding fault with your fellow servants and
   thinking that you could do their work better if you had it to do. But
   oh, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of His great Grace, do what you
   have to do with all your heart, mind, soul and strength. Make full
   proof of your ministry, whatever that ministry is.

   Then, next, be faithful to the goods committed to you. I have already
   dwelt upon the necessity of earnestly defending the faith. Oh, do not,
   I pray you, tolerate in yourselves any quibbling at God's Word, any
   picking and choosing out of the great Truths of Inspiration! Endeavor
   to know the Lord's way, the Lord's truth, the Lord's life and in way,
   truth and life, follow the Lamb wherever He goes. Search the Scriptures
   and follow where the Scriptures lead you. Let no book composed by the
   wisest of men dictate your conscience. Remember that the Bible, and the
   Bible, alone, has the stamp of Infallibility upon it. Follow its
   guidance and so be faithful to the treasure that is entrusted to your
   hands. Had good men, in past ages, been but faithful to the Word of the
   Lord, there had not been so much of schism, heresy and false doctrine
   in the world. And if all professing Christians shall always be faithful
   to the pure Word of God, then will come the days of the true unity of
   the Church of Christ, and the conquest of the world by Christ!

   Next, we are bound to be faithful to every person in the household.
   This is a difficult work, but let us try to accomplish it. All of us,
   according as we are put into the stewardship, must labor for the good
   of all our Brothers and Sisters in Christ. We sang just now--

   "Have You a lamb in all Your flock I would refuse to feed?"

   and I hope that our answer is," No, great Shepherd of Israel, there is
   not a single lamb in all Your flock which we do not reckon to be better
   than ourselves." Do you not sometimes feel as if, if you could be as
   sure of being right as the very least of the Lord's family, you would
   be perfectly content? We long to rise to the greatest heights of
   holiness and consecration, but yet, if we are allowed to wash the
   saints' feet, it will be a great honor for us. To do anything for
   Jesus, to be a doormat at the Temple gate, is a high privilege for any
   of us! Let us try, then, to do all that we ought to do in love and
   kindness to all the members of our Master's household.

   And then we must be faithful to the outside world as well. You see, a
   steward who looked to everything indoors, and then allowed people out
   of doors to cheat his master and run away with his goods, would not be
   a faithful steward! And you and I have much to do with the souls of men
   outside the Church of Christ. Oh, what a world this is! What a world it
   is! Shall we be clear of the blood of all these millions in London?
   Ride or walk from one end of this great city to another and see if you
   do not feel a mountain of granite pressing on your soul! O Lord, what
   can we do? "Who is sufficient for these things?" Living in such an age
   as this and in such a thronged city as this, oh, how shall we be
   faithful to all the people?

   When George Fox was dying, he said, "I am clear, I am clear." I have
   envied him a thousand times, for I believe the Quaker was clear of the
   blood of men. He said many odd things and some things he had better not
   have said, but he never kept back anything that seemed to come from his
   soul. It mattered not to whom he spoke--whether it was to the king or
   to a beggar--he said what he believed, without fear of mortal man.
   Think of brave John Knox, of whom they could say when they buried him,
   "Here lies he who never feared the face of man." O stewards of God--and
   I have already said that all you Christians are, in your measure,
   stewards of Christ--may this be said of you! "It is required in
   stewards, that a man be found faithful." I have shown you what a wide
   field that one requirement covers--only the Grace of God can be
   sufficient for us that we may be found faithful.

   III. Now, very briefly, indeed, I want to answer the third question,
   HOW ARE WE, IN OUR STEWARDSHIP, IN DANGER OF MISBEHAVING? Well, we can
   very readily misbehave by acting as if we were masters. You know the
   tendency of Jack in office--let us avoid anything like that. Remember
   what our Lord said about the man who began to domineer over his fellow
   servants and to beat them. This is not the way for a steward to behave,
   for he is, himself, only a servant. He has to look after other servants
   but his master will look after him--and if he gives himself great airs,
   he must beware lest his master should dismiss him from his service, and
   say to him, "You shall no longer be steward."

   Next, a great deal of misbehavior is caused by endeavoring to please
   men. If the steward begins to try to please his fellow servants and to
   curry favor with them that they may speak well of him, he will very
   soon be a traitor to his master. O dear Friends, seek to please men for
   their good to edification, but never forget that he who is the servant
   of men cannot be the servant of God, for "no man can serve two
   masters." May the Lord help us to feel that we are not judged of men's
   judgment, but that we are going to do our duty as under the great
   Taskmaster's own eyes!

   Next, we can very much injure our stewardship by idling, or trifling,
   or growing careless, or leaving our hearts out of our work. We can do
   this in the Sunday school and we can do this in the pulpit! When a
   man's heart is in his service, he does not need to tell you that it is,
   for you can soon see it. And I believe that there is more power in
   downright sincerity than in all the talent that God ever gave to men! A
   simple, humble, lowly speaker who only says what the Holy Spirit
   prompts him to say--and who is quite indifferent about how he says it
   so long as he can say it in a right spirit--he is the man who will
   reach the hearts of other men! Brothers, if we begin turning over our
   words, so as to find out comely syllables with which we may please and
   tickle human ears, we shall lose all power over our hearers! I think
   that the very best nosegay we can ever give to our friends may be made
   by plucking a handful of field flowers just as we find them, and then
   saying, "These grew in God's garden. We have not arranged them very
   prettily, for their innate beauty is such that anything artificial
   would but injure them." Oh, let us see to it that we live wholly and
   alone for this great work of winning souls and glorifying our
   Master--and let us always speak with the accent of conviction!

   If you do not believe the Gospel, do not tell it to others! But if you
   do believe it, say it as if you meant it! I read, the other day, the
   story of a minister, whose boys came to him and asked if they might go
   to a certain show, and he said, "Well my dear boys, I--I--I--I hardly
   like it. I will show you, by-and-by, the objections there are to it. I
   do not decidedly forbid you"--and the boys were out of the room in a
   minute! They ran off to their companion and said, "Jack, we may go."
   Yes, their father's hesitation was quite enough for them. He was going
   to say, "I do not decidedly forbid you, but, but, but"--only the boys
   did not care about his, "buts." And there are some ministers who, in
   preaching, say that a false doctrine is true, to some extent, only
   there are certain objections, difficulties and so on. People do not
   wait to hear the objections and difficulties, but off they go at once
   with a bit of bad doctrine! It is often so, and it is a pity that it
   should be so. Ah, me, this trifling with Divine Truth, this playing
   with God's Word will be sure to do an infinite deal of mischief and mar
   the stewardship of any man who yields to it!

   Next, we can prove ourselves unfaithful stewards by misusing our
   Master's goods, employing what He entrusted to us for some other end
   than His Glory, or by neglecting some of the household. We may so
   preach that there is never any milk for babes and, on the other hand,
   we may so preach that there is never a morsel of meat for men--and the
   milk may be so watery that it is not good enough even for babes! It is
   a sin to neglect any one member of the household, for we must be found
   faithful to them all if we would be judged to be faithful at all.

   We can also misbehave ourselves as stewards by conniving at whatever is
   wrong in our fellow servants. "Anything for a peaceful life!" is the
   motto of the unfaithful steward. "Let men live as they like. We cannot
   rebuke them because then they might quarrel with us." Ah, dear me, if
   we are not prepared to bear a little of that sort of reproach! Even if
   reproof of sin must bring unkindness in return, we must not withhold
   that reproof, but must administer it with all the more prayerful-ness
   and kindness! It must be given lest, as it was with Eli, a curse shall
   come upon our house because our sons made themselves vile and we
   restrained them not.

   And, dear Friends, there is one other thing that any steward may do
   and, thereby, spoil his stewardship. That is, prove unfaithful by
   forgetting that his Lord will soon come. He may come before we begin
   our next piece of work. He may come while we are in the middle of it,
   or He may come just as we are closing it and, may then and there
   require an account at our hands! Oh, how earnestly we should live if we
   were sure that Christ would come tonight! What family prayer you would
   have tonight if you knew that before the morning dawned, Christ would
   come! Some of you, perhaps, would want to give something extra to His
   cause, if you knew that it would be the last opportunity you would have
   of doing so. Some of you would go and wake your children up and talk to
   them about Christ if you knew that He would come before the morning
   light.

   There is a great deal left undone by most of us--we are not all like
   Mr. Whitefield, who could say when he went to bed, "I have not left
   even a pair of gloves out of their place. If I were to die tonight,
   everything is right." It is a beautiful thing to live, so, and that is
   how God's stewards should live! "Ready, yes, ready," to live or to die,
   to go on or to leave off, to stop here or to go to Heaven--whichever
   the Master appoints! This is good stewardship. But if we forget that He
   will come, we shall get into a loose and slovenly way of acting--and
   that will be to our own discredit and to our Master's dishonor.

   IV. Now, finally, WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT OF OUR STEWARDSHIP?

   Supposing we are good stewards, what will the result be? A reward from
   our Master's own lips. In the Day of Account He will say, "Well done,
   good and faithful servant." Now, after that, you do not need a crown,
   do you? You do not need any ruling over many cities! You will have all
   that, but I think that this utterance of our Master is quite enough for
   any steward of His, "Well done, good and faithful servant." Oh, if He
   should ever say that to us, there is enough in it to make a whole
   eternity of bliss!

   But suppose that, at the last, we are found unfaithful, what will the
   result be? Punishment from the Lord's own hand! If it is so, that we
   have never washed our robes and made them white in the blood of the
   Lamb. If it is so that our hearts have never been renewed by Divine
   Grace. If it is so that we have never been saved from our sin and,
   consequently, have never been saved from our unfaithfulness--if it
   should turn out that we have never been saved from living to ourselves,
   never been saved so as to live honestly and faithfully to God--then
   what will the result be? I mean, for you who profess to be Christians?
   Here are our Lord's words. I am not going to enlarge on them any more
   than I did on the other words--"The lord of that servant will come in a
   day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and
   will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the
   unbelievers"--as if that was the worst punishment that could be meted
   out to him! God grant that none of us may ever have that portion!

   But oh, you who are unbelievers--do you not see that your portion is
   that which God will appoint to these who are unfaithful and only worthy
   of condemnation? What is your portion? It is something truly terrible,
   for it will be that which God appoints as a punishment for the worst of
   sinners, the treacherous and the unfaithful! O unbelievers, I would not
   be in your place five minutes for all the world! As the Lord lives,
   there is but a step between you and Hell! Only a breath and you may be
   gone. If I were in your place, I would be afraid to eat a morsel of
   bread, tonight, lest a crumb should go the wrong way and, by causing my
   death, should land me in everlasting misery! One might be afraid to
   shut his eyes, tonight, as an unbeliever, lest, as he closed them on
   earth, he shut them forever to all light and hope, world without end--

   "You sinners, seek His Grace,

   Whose wrath you cannot bear! Fly to the shelter of His Cross And find
   salvation there."

   Oh, fly to Jesus at once, for He has said, "Him that comes to Me I will
   in no wise cast out." God help you to trust to Christ, tonight, and to
   go out of this Tabernacle saved men and saved women, for Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE12:35-48.

   Verses 35-37. Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning;
   and you yourselves like unto men that wait for their master, when he
   will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may
   open unto him immediately. Blessed are those servants whom the master,
   when he comes, shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he
   shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come
   forth and serve them. This is a wonderful passage. Christ has already
   had one turn as a Servitor. He was Master and Lord, yet He washed His
   disciples' feet. But He says that if we are watchful and faithful, if
   we truly serve Him, the day shall come when, in all His robes of Glory,
   He shall gird Himself and serve us.

   38-40. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
   watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. And this know,
   that if the good man of the house had known what hour the thief would
   come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be
   broken into. Be you therefore ready also: for the Son of Man comes at
   an hour when you think not. This is a warning to Christ's own people,
   but it is still more a warning to those who do not know Him. Suppose He
   were to come tonight--where would you be, you who have, up to now,
   lived as if you were your own masters and were by no means the servants
   of Christ? Take heed unto yourselves, for you know not when your Lord
   shall come!

   41-44. Then Peter said unto Him, Lord, speak, then, this parable unto
   us, or even to all? And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and
   wise steward, whom his master shall make ruler over his household, to
   give them their portion of meat in due season? Blessed is that servant
   whom his master, when he comes, shall find so doing. Of a truth I say
   unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has. What
   rewards Christ has in store for His people! If we will but be His
   servants, now, and the servants of our Brothers and Sisters, He will
   make us rulers over all that He has! I cannot attempt to explain all
   that these words mean, but I bless the Lord that they are absolutely
   true!

   45, 46. But and if that servant says in his heart, My master delays his
   coming; and shall begin to beat the male and female servants and to eat
   and drink, and to be drunk; the master of that servant will come on a
   day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and
   will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
   unbelievers. Again let me say that I cannot attempt to explain all that
   these words mean, but, oh, what will be the horror, the terror, of the
   punishment which will fall upon the unfaithful steward, the minister
   who is untrue to his holy calling, the professor who says that he is a
   child of God and a steward of Christ, and yet is unfaithful to his
   trust? I will read our Lord's words again. You know how we are
   sometimes accused of saying things too dreadful about the wrath of God
   in the world to come, but, Beloved, we never say anything dreadful
   enough! If you will carefully examine the Word of God, you will find
   there expressions such as even Dante or the mediaeval preachers, with
   all the horrors they depicted, never surpassed! We cannot exaggerate
   the awful depth of meaning which we find in the words of the loving
   Christ, Himself! Let me read this verse again--"The master of that
   servant will come on a day when he looks not for him, and at an hour
   when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him
   his portion with the unbelievers."

   47, 48. And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and did not
   prepare himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten
   with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy
   of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomever much is
   given, of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed
   much, of him they will ask the more. Judge you, then, Brothers and
   Sisters, how much of ability and talent your Lord has entrusted to
   you-- and be not content to have rendered Him some service--but look
   for proportionate service and humble yourselves in His Presence if your
   service is not in proportion to the opportunities entrusted to you! Who
   among us can refrain from humbling himself before God when he thinks of
   this?

The Lord's Knowledge, Our Safeguard

   (No. 2441)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 1, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   30, 1887.

   "The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
   reserve the unjust unto the Day of Judgment to be punished." 2 Peter
   2:9.

   THERE are very narrow limits to our knowledge. There is a great breadth
   to our conceit, but the things that we really know are very few, after
   all. He who is wisest will be the first to confess his own ignorance.
   Our faith in the superior knowledge of God is a great source of comfort
   to us. That He knows everything is a sort of Omnipresent covering to
   our naked ignorance. Though we know not as yet, we rejoice that He
   knows, and it is better that He should know than that we should know.
   Knowledge is safer in the hands of God than it would be in our hands.
   Only the Infinite God is to be trusted with infinite knowledge!

   The first words of our text, "The Lord knows," often come as a comfort
   to my own mind. The text says, "The Lord knows how to deliver the godly
   out of temptations." This is only one of the many things which the Lord
   knows. For instance, sometimes we meet with perplexing
   doctrines--perhaps we endeavor to effect reconciliation between the
   Predestination of God and the freedom of human action. It is better not
   to wade too far into those deep waters, lest we lose ourselves in an
   abyss! "The Lord knows." There is a reconciling point in His mind as to
   all the great Truths which He has revealed. One was wishful, the other
   night, to tell me some great secret which he had discovered, but I was
   not so wishful to hear it, for I did not think that I should be any
   holier or any happier if I did hear it! I was just as pleased not to
   know as I should have been to know the secret. That insatiable craving
   to know everything draws away the life of men from what ought to be
   their insatiable craving, namely, to be like God, to know Him, to trust
   Him, to love Him and to serve

   Him.

   Sometimes, dear Friends, we come across puzzling prophecies. Some
   Brothers and Sisters profess to know all about prophecy. I do not,
   neither am I quite sure that they do. This I know, that you have only
   to place one set of interpreters of prophecy over against another set
   and they speedily swallow one another, as Aaron's rod swallowed the
   rods of the magicians of Egypt! But I am satisfied to feel that "the
   Lord knows." And He knows how every prophecy will be fulfilled and the
   exact order in which the prophecies will come to be facts. We may make
   our prophetic charts if we like, but God will follow His own chart. We
   may think that we have discovered the clue of the maze in the
   Apocalypse and in Daniel, but whether we have, or have not, is of no
   very great consequence! John and Daniel spoke by the Holy Spirit and
   their words will all be fulfilled in due time--and the Lord knows all
   about the whole matter.

   The same is the case in reference to the Lord's amazing promises. Many
   of them are so amazingly bright and grand that we sometimes ask
   ourselves, "How can all these things be fulfilled?" And possibly, like
   Abraham, we may have a Divine promise, yet there may come a precept or
   a Providence which seems to murder the promise and render its
   fulfillment impossible, as when God said to the Patriarch, "In Isaac
   shall your seed be called," and then bade him offer up his son in whom
   the promise was wrapped up! Yet Abraham, although he did not know how
   the promise would be fulfilled, staggered not because of unbelief, for
   he felt that God knew. God will keep His promises, Brothers and
   Sisters. We need not try to help Him as she did who sought to secure
   the blessing for her favorite son by setting him on an evil and
   mischievous piece of plotting to deceive his aged father.

   It is not your work to fulfill God's promises--you will have enough to
   do to obey His precepts--and you will need His help to enable you to do
   that! He does not need your help in fulfilling His promises, but you
   may say with regard to the whole of them, "The Lord knows how to
   fulfill them and He will fulfill them to the dot of every i and the
   stroke of every t. Not one good thing that He has promised shall ever
   fail to be bestowed upon those who put their trust in Him."

   The same is the case, also, dear Friends, with regard to afflictive
   Providences. "I cannot see the wisdom of this trial," says one. "I
   cannot understand why this trouble has befallen me," says another. Why
   do you wish to understand? Why do you need to see? We walk by faith,
   not by sight! I have known what it is to feel a thrill of sacred joy
   within my soul when my Divine Master has given me a task altogether
   beyond my strength. I have felt, "If this work had been only half as
   heavy as it is, I might have attempted it, but now I know that I cannot
   perform this task in my own strength, so I am cast upon Omnipotence."
   It is poor work--paddling about on the muddy beach, lifting first one
   foot and then the other! The grand exercise is to swim--and you must
   swim when you cannot touch the bottom. Sometimes God puts us into an
   ocean of afflictions where there seems to be no bottom. Our trials are
   altogether too heavy for us, they quite overwhelm us. Oh, then, what a
   mercy it is if we have faith enough to trust in God!

   If Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego had been summoned to the common trial
   by ordeal--well-known among our ancestors--that of walking over red-hot
   plowshares, they might have hoped, somehow, to pick their way. But when
   they were "bound in their coats, their hose, their hats and their other
   garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning, fiery
   furnace"--where there was no possibility of escape unless Jehovah,
   Himself, entered the furnace with them--well, then, they had a grander
   arena for the display of faith in God! They had passed from the
   littleness of human possibility into the grandeurs of Omnipotence--and
   God was glorified as they walked loose in the midst of the fire having
   had nothing burnt except their bonds! It is a great gain when any tried
   or persecuted child of God has the company of his Heavenly Father even
   in the midst of the fiery trial to which he is exposed.

   It is the same with regard to grievous temptations. Some of the Lord's
   very dear children are sorely tempted, sometimes by their own thoughts,
   into which Satan casts the bitterness of his blasphemies. Sometimes by
   trials at home which they cannot understand, or by afflictions which
   seem like that wind from the wilderness which smote the four corners of
   the house where Job's children were feasting. Well now, at such times,
   when we cannot comprehend our temptations, but seem altogether in a
   maze, and at a standstill, then let us fall back on these three words,
   "The Lord knows." The infinite breadth of Divine Wisdom comprehends all
   our needs, all our sorrows, all our feeblenesses, all our trials and
   temptations! Let this be like an all-surrounding atmosphere to us,
   breathing which we shall feel our life strengthened and our hearts made
   glad!

   In our text, the Apostle calls attention to one item of God's
   knowledge. He makes us feel quite safe as to the government of the
   universe, seeing it is in the hands of the All-Knowing One, the Lord
   who knows, on the one hand, "how to deliver the godly out of
   temptations" and, on the other hand, how "to reserve the unjust unto
   the Day of Judgment to be punished."

   I. In considering these words, I shall ask you, first, to think of THE
   LORD'S KNOWLEDGE IN REFERENCE TO CHARACTER. This may not appear on the
   surface of the text, but it is evidently implied, for the Lord would
   not know how to deliver the godly if He did not know who were godly and
   He would not know how to reserve the unjust unto the future judgment if
   He did not know who were unjust! Reflect, then, for a few moments, upon
   the Truth of God that the Lord knows the godly. Sometimes they come
   under trials and temptations so that they are not known to others.
   Their former friends and their kindred stand aloof from them, as Job's
   friends and kindred did from him. The Patriarch was so sorely smitten
   and wounded that his three friends concluded he must be a hypocrite. He
   "was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil,"
   a very favorite of Heaven, yet his friends did not know him as one of
   the godly because of the great trials which had befallen him.

   Yes, and sometimes, because of imperfections, others may not know us to
   be godly. It is a pity that it should be so, but there are times when
   sin fiercely assails the Believer and he is sorely put to it. He has to
   confess that he gives cause to others to stand in doubt of him. Well,
   Beloved, when others do not know you to be godly, the Lord knows! "The
   Lord knows them that are His." There have been secret passages between
   you and God which nobody else can ever know. He perceives your
   sincerity in the midst of your infirmity and, though He will chasten
   you for your sin, He still knows that you believe in Him. You may, like
   Samson, lose your eyes and be shorn of your strength. I pray that you
   may not fall so low as that, but even if you do, remember that it is
   written of the blinded Nazarite, "howbeit the hair of his head began to
   grow, again," and the Lord gave him back his former strength, for,
   notwithstanding all his folly and his sin, he was a

   Believer in Jehovah! He had a firm, childlike faith in the Most High,
   and in the power of that faith he did great exploits and the Lord, even
   in Samson's death-struggle, acknowledged him as His servant and avenged
   him of his adversaries.

   Do not let us get into such a condition that others may justifiably
   doubt us, but if they maliciously doubt us--if without cause they cast
   out our name as evil, if they slander us and invent fictions and
   falsehoods to injure our character--let us come back to this, which is
   implied, if not stated, in our text, "The Lord knows the godly."

   It may sometimes come as a great comfort to us that the Lord knows the
   godly when they do not know themselves. I have heard some of God's
   people speak as though this were not possible, but I boldly assert it
   from my own observation of hundreds of those who truly love the Lord.
   We may sometimes be so beset with temptations and our spirit may so
   sink within us that we may have to stand in doubt as to our own
   salvation and say, "Am I really the Lord's, or am I not?" There are
   times when we have to hear the question from our own conscience--and
   why should we not hear it from our own conscience, since Peter heard it
   from his Master's own lips, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you love Me?" I
   would like to say to you, with the poet Cowper--

   "Come, then--a still small whisper in your ear--

   He has no hope who never had a fear

   And He who never doubted of his state,

   He may, perhaps--perhaps he may--too late."

   It is not an ill thing to go and search to the very foundations to see
   whether there is peace between God and your soul or not! Some of the
   best of the Lord's servants have had to go through the Valley of the
   Shadow of Death, wherein the voice of the evil spirit has been louder
   in their ears than the whisper of their own faith--and they have had to
   stand still in utter bewilderment! They could not get their sword out
   of its sheath, or, if they could, they were unable to use it, for it
   seemed as if the enemy could not be touched by their sword. The only
   weapon they could handle was the weapon of all-prayer, as they cried
   out in their anguish, "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" Now
   remember, when you do not know yourself to be godly, God knows! Here is
   the comfort for our hearts, "The Lord knows the godly." He knows both
   them and their ways--but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

   As this is true about the godly, so is it most solemnly certain
   concerning the ungodly. The Lord knows the unjust. That is to say,
   despite their loud pretensions of piety, the Lord knows that they are
   really ungodly. They have joined the Church, they wear the name of
   Christian, they are even honored among Christian men--but the Lord
   knows the unjust--no garb of religion can conceal their wickedness, no
   form of pious speech can hide the insincerity of their hearts! Oh,
   should there be any such here, may this flash of light go right through
   them! The Lord knows the unjust, whatever they may pretend to be.

   He knows them, also, notwithstanding their great possessions. "I have
   seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay
   tree." And many a hollow profession has been gilded over with riches
   and, because the man was well-to-do, they thought that he must be doing
   well--two very different things, however. But God can read us through
   and through. If we climbed to a throne, He would discern the state of
   our heart even there! And if we had the acclamations of a nation for
   our devotion and piety, He would discover us, even then, for all things
   are naked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do! Let this
   not be forgotten by any of us! Let us not try to deceive the Lord, but
   let everything be open and above-board before Him. There should be in
   us all the most strict truthfulness--I am afraid that there is a tinge
   of hypocrisy even in the most gracious. May God take it away from us
   and let us walk in the Light of God as He is in the light, while the
   blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, still cleanses us from all sin, for we
   shall still need it!

   II. Now let us come to the very marrow of the text, which is this--THE
   LORD'S KNOWLEDGE IN REFERENCE TO THE GODLY. "The Lord knows how to
   deliver the godly out of temptations."

   Notice their name--"the godly"--that is, the people who know God. He is
   no dream of fancy to them--they know Him. He is the most real of all
   existences to them. Knowing Him, they fear Him. They have learned to
   fear and tremble before the Most High. It was a name of scorn which
   they gave to the Society of Friends when they called them, "Quakers."
   But, after all, it was a right thing for them, like Moses, to
   exceedingly fear and quake in the Presence of the Most High God. The
   godly also trust God. To them, God is the pillar of their confidence,
   the brightness of their life, the life of their light, the light of
   their delight! They rest on Him, as on the Rock of Ages, and they rest
   nowhere else. These godly ones also love God--their heart goes out
   towards Him. He is their Joy. He is their Companion, their Friend. He
   is All in

   All to them. The Lord knows these godly ones and He makes them to know
   Him. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will
   show them His Covenant."

   Well, it is certain that these godly ones will have to suffer
   temptation. Gold is tried in the furnace. Good things are tested and
   proved--and godly men are full often tempted and afflicted and tried.
   They shall, very few of them, get to Heaven without passing through the
   trying waters and testing fires, else to them the promise would not be
   true, "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and
   through the rivers they shall not overflow you; when you walk through
   the fires, you shall not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon
   you." The Lord knows all about them and their trials! And especially,
   according to our text, "The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of
   temptations." Let me make a few observations upon that Truth of God.

   The first is this--His knowledge answers much better for them than
   their own would do. They do not know how they will be delivered out of
   temptations. Sometimes they make a guess and so make a mistake--and
   then they are disappointed. They would be far wiser if they left
   knowledge to the Most High and kept to their own sphere, which is that
   of trusting, believing and knowing that the Lord knows! One says of
   Adam that he knew a great deal and it was a pity that he did not know
   one thing more, namely, that he knew enough, for had he known that he
   knew enough, he would not have eaten of the fruit of the Tree of the
   Knowledge of Good and Evil! You know enough when you believe. If you
   know nothing except how you can put you hand into the hand of God, you
   may go boldly on with a surer tread than the best-sighted man ever knew
   by his own wisdom alone! "Commit your way unto the Lord; trust also in
   Him, and He shall bring it to pass." Better that the knowledge be with
   the Lord, your Head, than in your own head, for you are not the Lord!
   "The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations." It is
   almost a cant expression among the ungodly--"The Lord knows." Oh, but
   let it be a very solemn expression among us, "The Lord knows" and,
   blessed be His name, "The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of
   temptations!"

   In the next place, His knowledge of their case is perfect. He knew the
   temptation before it came! Before He appointed it, He weighed it in His
   unerring scales--not in the big scale of the coal merchant, but in the
   delicate scales of the chemist who measures every tiny grain and has a
   scale that will turn with the weight of a single hair! If God appoints
   me 10 afflictions, the devil, himself, cannot make 11 of them! If the
   Lord shall put half an ounce of a bitter ingredient into your cup, all
   the devils in Hell cannot make an ounce of it! God knows your
   affliction before it comes to you and He knows it when it comes to you.
   When Israel was in Egypt, the Lord knew their afflictions. Well said
   David, "You have known my soul in adversities." The Lord knows just
   where the trial touches and pinches us, how we grieve under it, how far
   it has gone and how far it must not go. The Lord knows our afflictions
   with a perfect knowledge before they come--and when they come--and He
   also knows all about them when they go. I bless His name that He can
   foresee the effect of trial upon His children! He knows what Grace it
   will brighten. He knows what shams it will destroy. He knows what it
   will teach us and He knows what it will make us unlearn, which we
   thought we needed to know. He knows all about us from beginning to end
   and, consequently, His knowledge of our temptations is absolutely
   perfect--and we may be content and rest in perfect peace. "He knows the
   way that I take."

   And this is true in every case of every child of God. "The Lord knows
   how to deliver"--not merely some one godly man, or some 20 godly men,
   but "the godly" as a whole, all of them! Dear Friend, to put it very
   personally, the Lord knows how to deliver you out of your present
   temptation. But do not put your hand to sin in order to deliver
   yourself! That is what Satan will tempt you to do. Lay not the hand of
   Uzzah upon the Ark of the Lord, much less upon any piece of furniture
   in your own house! Oh, the temptation there is, sometimes, to indulge
   in a hasty temper, or to speculate in business, or to keep back a part
   of the truth, or to pretend to be something which you are not, or to
   allow a sin to go unreproved because you wish to escape reproach or to
   avoid censorious judgments! No, the Lord knows how to deliver you, and
   if He does not deliver you, then say with those three holy children
   whom I mentioned a few minutes ago, "If it is so, our God whom we serve
   is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will
   deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto you,
   O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image
   which you have set up." Do not attempt to supplement the wisdom of God
   with your insanity, for it is nothing better than insanity when you
   fancy that you can ever profit by wrongdoing!

   God's knowledge, as revealed to us in this verse, gives us a very
   comfortable thought. If the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of
   temptation, then, depend upon it, there is a way of deliverance out of
   every temptation. The Lord does not know what does not exist. If He
   knows that there is a way of deliverance, then there is a way of
   deliverance, and there is a way of escape for you! You do not see
   it--do not ask or wish to see it. Ah, those eyes of ours--would God
   that they were put out! I was going to say we see a great deal too
   much, Brothers and Sisters, or we think we do. And because we say we
   see, we go blindly on, stumbling and blundering every foot of the way!
   It is for God to see and it is for us to believe and to trust in Him!
   There is a way of deliverance and it will be proved before long that
   there is a way of deliverance for you. If you believe it, you shall see
   it. God knows how to deliver--that means that there is a way of
   deliverance!

   But it means more. The Lord knows how to deliver the godly in the way
   most profitable for themselves. We have invented various ways of
   deliverance, but God has not used them. And then we have found out
   another way, but He has not acknowledged that. And we have sought
   another way, but He would not have that. No, He knows how to deliver,
   so why do you come in with your inventions? Verily, I shall apply that
   text even to you, "God has made man upright; but they have sought out
   many inventions"--even inventions for escaping from trouble and trial!
   But the Lord knows which is the best way for their deliverance. He will
   bring you out of Egypt, but not in the way you thought, that you should
   flee away all of a sudden and escape by stealth. No, no--this is how He
   will deliver you, even as He delivered Israel of old-- "He brought them
   forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person
   among their tribes." He will bring you out in a profitable way and a
   right way!

   And, best of all, He will bring you out in the way which will be most
   glorifying to Himself. With a high hand and an outstretched arm, He led
   His people out of Egypt, shattering all the might and pomp of the
   proudest monarch of the day! And the emancipated nation sang unto the
   Lord a new song as they took their timbrels and danced before Him who
   had triumphed gloriously over their cruel oppressor. That is what you,
   also, shall yet do. "The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of
   temptations" in the way that is most glorious to Himself. God's
   children ought to think less of what is done, at any time, than of the
   Glory that God gets out of it. We sometimes want to see a great work,
   but a great work may not glorify God. If there is a little, obscure,
   unknown work--and to human eyes it remains almost a secret--if it
   glorifies God, it is to be preferred to the most gigantic wave of
   supposed revival that, after all, would leave behind it the names of
   men, but the name of God would be forgotten! In all things let God be
   glorified! Oh, that we would always aim at this objective! The
   salvation of men is a grand aim, but it must always be in subordination
   to the Glory of the Lord, that His arm may be revealed and that all
   flesh may see it together. Oh, that God might be glorified! Be this our
   prayer in our trials and in coming out of our trials, "Father, glorify
   Your name."

   III. Now, I must say a few solemn and weighty words upon THE LORD'S
   KNOWLEDGE IN REFERENCE TO

   THE UNJUST--"and to reserve the unjust unto the Day of Judgment to be
   punished."

   Observe that Peter does not say, "the ungodly." He is not dealing with
   their inward character so much as with their outward conduct. They are
   "unjust." Ungodliness is unrighteousness and, sooner or later, the
   ungodly are seen to be unjust.

   Ungodly men are legally unjust--they have broken God's Law and,
   therefore, they are not justified in His sight. Worse than that, they
   are evangelically unjust, for they have not believed in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and, therefore, they have not His justifying righteousness to
   cover them. And then they are practically unjust, for their life is an
   injustice to God and to men. They have not received the sanctifying
   power of the Spirit to make them just in their daily lives.

   God knows how to deal with these people. Let me read Peter's words,
   again, "The Lord knows how to reserve the unjust unto the Day of
   Judgment to be punished." You hear their blasphemies. You mark their
   infamies and your indignation burns against them--but the Lord knows
   how to deal with them. He knows how to reserve them under restraints.
   He acts like a magistrate who commits a prisoner for trial at the Great
   Assize. That is what God has done with some of you ungodly ones--you
   are committed for trial at the Day of Judgment. The Lord lets you live,
   but you are only out on bail and you will soon have to appear before
   the great Judge of Heaven and earth.

   According to the Revised Version, and I think that translation is
   correct, the punishment has already begun. The Lord knows how to go, on
   even, now punishing the ungodly! That unrest of theirs, those fears,
   the trembling--all show that God is dealing with them. They swell
   themselves out very big, they laugh with loud laughter, they deny the
   Truth of God and they scoff at Christ--but, believe me, dear Friends,
   you need not wish to be like they are--no, not even like the
   healthiest, the wealthiest, the proudest and the greatest of them! The
   Lord knows how, even now, to smite them, and He does smite them! The
   life of an ungodly man, at its best, is a horrible life. I would sooner
   be God's dog than the devil's darling! It is better to be the most
   weeping Jeremiah than the most boastful Pharaoh. The day will come when
   the ungodly will, themselves, see it to be so--and the proudest tyrant
   will envy the lowest man or woman who crept humbly to the Mercy Seat
   and cried, "God be merciful to me, a sinner!"

   The Lord knows how to deal with the unjust even now and He will know
   how to deal with them by-and-by. O Sirs, these are no trifling matters
   of which I am speaking! The unjust may be in the fullness of their
   strength, but the Lord can bring them down to lie on a sickbed. Even
   there they may defy God, but He knows how to stop their impious mouths.
   "Ah," He says--and that is an awful text--"Ah, I will ease Me of My
   adversaries, and avenge Me of My enemies," as if they vexed and plagued
   His Holy Spirit and, at last He says, "I will be rid of them. They
   shall not trouble Me any longer. I will ease Me of My adversaries."
   Then He sends the "reaper, whose name is Death." I think that I meet
   him now, swinging his sharp sickle, and I say to him, "Whither away, O
   Death? What are you about to do? Will you dare destroy that scarlet
   poppy blazing in the midst of the growing corn?" "Ah," he says, "one
   touch of my sickle will bring it down." "And that blue flower, yonder,
   in all its splendid majesty of beauty?" "Ah," he says, "I will lay that
   low with all the common grasses of the field."

   The Lord knows how to deal with the unjust in the next world as well as
   in this. Oh, that dreadful thought! Trouble not yourselves about it,
   except to "flee from the wrath to come!" Raise no perplexing questions
   in your mind. The Lord knows how to deal with the unjust in the world
   to come and that dealing shall be according to the strictest rule of
   justice. The Judge of all the earth shall do right--men shall not be
   able to accuse Him of injustice! He will deal with them as the God who
   cannot err. They are in His hands and, "it is a fearful thing to fall
   into the hands of the living God." Do not believe those who tell you
   that it is not. They are the servants of the devil--be they who they
   may--who seek to delude your souls upon this matter! I beseech you,
   escape for your lives! Look not behind you, stay not in all the plain
   but escape to the Cross of Christ, for there, and there, only, is there
   salvation for the unrighteous! Oh, seek it now, for Jesus' sake!

   I close with an illustration of the text which I feel almost certain
   was in the mind of Peter when he wrote these words, "The Lord knows how
   to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto
   the Day of Judgment to be punished." Turn to the 12th Chapter of the
   Acts of the Apostles, where you have the record of Peter lying asleep
   in the prison, watched by soldiers, and yet at dead of night the angel
   of the Lord came into the prison, smote Peter on the side, bade him
   bind on his sandals, gird himself and follow him. Peter went through
   all the doors of the prison till he came to the great iron gate and
   that opened of its own accord! And there stood Peter, out in the
   street, in answer to the prayers made at the Prayer Meeting at Mrs.
   Mark's house, when the Christians in Jerusalem were gathered that night
   to pray for him. This miracle proves that the Lord knows how to deliver
   the godly out of trial!

   Read the rest of the chapter, please, for that takes in the other half
   of my text. Herod sat upon his throne of state and all the people were
   paying him homage. And when he made an oration from his golden throne,
   they shouted, "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man." That same
   God, who had delivered Peter, knew how to lay hold of Herod, for we are
   told that immediately the angel of the Lord smote him and he was eaten
   of worms and gave up the ghost! The first is a brilliant deed of
   infinitely wise Grace, the next is an astounding deed of n infinitely
   wise Justice! It is not necessary that you go to the gallows to meet
   your doom--a few worms can destroy you! It is not necessary that you be
   killed in a great railway accident, or that there be a collision at
   sea, or that you fall on the field of battle! Herod was eaten of worms.
   A grape-stone has, before now, choked and killed a man. A draught of
   water has been poisonous to another. A little gas, that was almost
   impalpable, has laid another in his grave. There is not one of you
   ungodly ones who can escape if God shall say to His angels, "Smite that
   man while he sits in his pew. He has resisted My mercy and rejected My
   love. He will not come to Christ." You, too, may be eaten of worms
   before another Sunday comes! God grant that you may not meet such a
   fate, but may you learn the lesson of this text and feel the force and
   power of it in your own souls, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 PETER 116-21; 2:1-10.

   1 Peter 1:16. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when
   we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. There is need in these perilous
   times to come back to such an elementary Truth as this. The Truths
   taught us in God's Word are not fables, myths, or merely parables, but
   they are matters of actual fact. The Apostles were eyewitnesses of "the
   power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ"-- "eyewitnesses of His
   majesty." We receive these Truths of God without the slightest question
   and base our faith upon them. We would be troubled, indeed, if we had
   any doubts whatever about these great foundation facts of our holy
   religion.

   17, 18. For He received from God the Father honor and Glory when there
   came such a voice to Him from the excellent Glory, This is My beloved
   Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from Heaven
   we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount. They were not
   deceived--neither Peter, nor James, nor John. There was "such a voice"
   from God, Himself, which they literally heard. It was the Father
   bearing approving witness to the Person and work of His only-begotten
   and well-beloved Son.

   19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy. Surely nothing could be
   more sure than the evidence presented to the Apostles in the holy
   mount! Yet Peter thus writes to express his utmost confidence in the
   Word of God. Surer than the light he saw, which dazzled him. Surer than
   the voice he heard which he never failed to remember and to which he
   always bore unfaltering witness! Surer, even, than these things is that
   Divine Book which is still preserved to us--"We have also a more sure
   word of prophecy."

   19. Whereunto you do well that you take heed, as unto a light that
   shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the day star arises in
   your hearts. You already have the assurance of the Word, itself--you
   must build upon that and upon that, alone--but you shall have added to
   that a, "day dawns," and a, "day star," in your own hearts. We have the
   witness within us now--"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our
   spirit that we are the children of God." And those things which we have
   received by faith we now have proven to be true by their effect upon
   our own souls! We know the Light of God, now, because we walk in it! We
   know it to be the Light of God for it has enlightened us.

   20, 21. Knowing this, first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of
   any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by
   the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the
   Holy Spirit. How we rejoice in this fact! We shall never give it up. It
   is a disbelief of Inspiration which lies at the bottom of all the
   modern theories--but with this disbelief we have not the slightest
   fellowship! In our inmost souls we believe that "holy men of God spoke
   as they were moved (or, "borne along"), by the Holy Spirit." They spoke
   not for their own age, alone, neither were the prophecies given to a
   few persons so as to belong privately to them--but the whole Inspired
   Scripture stands fast for all the faithful and is the Truth of God to
   us, today, even as it was to those to whom it was first spoken!

   1 Peter 2:1. But there were false prophets also among the people. How
   true that still is! Be not startled, Brothers and Sisters, as though
   some strange thing had happened to us in this generation! It was always
   so and so it will continue. If there are true Prophets, there will also
   be false prophets. And if there is the Spirit of God, there will be the
   spirit of evil! And often, in proportion as the everlasting Truth of
   God is full of power, the everlasting lie will be full of power, too,
   and will strive mightily against it. That same sun and shower which
   shall make yonder wheat to grow, will, at the same time, cause the
   thorns to spring up! And perhaps for a time they may threaten to choke
   the wheat until, at last, the wheat will choke the thistles. "There
   were false prophets also among the people."

   1. Even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall
   bring in damnable heresies. They always try to do their hateful work
   privately and then they ask, "What is all this fuss about? We have not
   departed from the truth, we are as sound in the faith as any of you
   are," when they know, traitors that they are, that they are undermining
   the foundations and trying to take away the very cornerstone of the
   faith! These "false teachers" would deceive the very elect of God if it
   were possible, but they are not easily deceived, for God has given them
   a discerning mind by which they "try the spirits whether they are of
   God." The Lord Jesus said of His sheep, "A stranger will they not
   follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of
   strangers." Sheep though they are, they have discernment enough to know
   their shep-herd--and the godly soon detect false teachers who privily
   "bring in damnable heresies,"

   1, 2. Even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves
   swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by
   reason of whom the way of truth shall be spoken of evilly. They say,
   "It is narrow; it is old-fashioned; it is not in accordance with the
   spirit of the age." I know not what else they say, but, for all that
   they say, it still remains "the way of truth."

   3, 4. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
   merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and
   their damnation slumbers not. For if God spared not the angels that
   sinned, but cast them down to Hell, and delivered them into chains of
   darkness, to be reserved unto judgement. "If God spared not the angels
   that sinned," He will not spare any who sin, however high their
   position may be--even though they are the angels of the Churches, He
   will "cast them down to Hell."

   5. And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a
   preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
   ungodly. Which some in these days say could not be consistent with the
   acts of a God of Love. Their imaginary deity, from whom they have taken
   away every glorious attribute of holiness and justice, would not have
   done this! But the God that judges righteously must and will punish
   sin, as He always has done and, "this God is our God forever and ever,"
   even the God who is "a consuming fire."

   6-8. And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned
   them with an overthrow, making them an example unto those that after
   should live ungodly; and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy
   conversation of the wicked: (for that righteous man dwelling among
   them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day
   with their unlawful deeds). I love to see in God's people a holy horror
   of the sin which surrounds them. In several of the prayers in which we
   joined before we came upstairs to this service, there were many tears
   and cries over the wickedness of our streets--the impurity and the
   drunkenness which defile so many all around us. Alas! Alas! Men seem
   bent on horrible iniquity and it looks as if London, this great modern
   Babylon, will repeat the story of the cities of the plain! Well may we
   pray, "O Lord, have mercy upon the people!"

   9. The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations. As He
   delivered Lot--

   9, 10. And to reserve the unjust unto the Day of Judgment to be
   punished: but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
   uncleanness and despise government. We have far too many, nowadays, of
   both these sorts of sinners, and of the two sorts joined in one--"them
   that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise
   government."

   10. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak
   evil of dignities. There let us cease our reading and turn to another
   holy song in which we will praise our God, whose Grace has made us to
   differ from the ungodly by whom we are surrounded.

"My Beloved Is Mine"

   (No. 2442)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 8, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 11, 1887.

   "My beloved is mine, and I am His." Song of Solomon 2:16.

   THIS is a short verse from the Song of Songs and I do not hesitate to
   say that it is the soul and heart of that Divine composition. The bride
   dressed in her richest poesy wears no jewel more precious than this
   diamond of full assured possession! There is poetry here which none of
   the sons of music can excel. It is the heart's minstrelsy at its very
   best. This little sonnet might be sung in Heaven and the golden harps
   would be well employed if every string went with the accompaniment. How
   I wish you could, each one, sing it now with a clear sweet voice!--

   "Now I my best Beloved's am, And He is mine."

   Alas, many of the Lord's own chosen and called ones are afraid to take
   up this chorus and join with us! I do not condemn them, but I am eager
   to comfort them. What would they give?--rather, what would they not
   give--if they could but say, "Christ is mine"? Yet they hesitate. The
   desire is strong, but the doubt is killing and they dare not sing with
   us. It seems too good, too great, too glorious a claim to come from
   their lips! They sometimes hope, but they as often fear. They make a
   dash for it, now and then, and trust that Christ is theirs--and then
   they subside into their former doubting. They are humble, modest,
   retiring--but I fear I must add--they are, at least in a measure,
   unbelieving!

   I want to lead these true hearts up to the table that they may feast
   upon the dainties provided for faith. I know that even now, as they
   hear the text, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His," they are saying,
   "Happy people that can speak thus, but I cannot. I am afraid it would
   be presumption and, perhaps, hypocrisy, on my part, if I were to use
   such language." And yet, dear Heart, it is very possible that you have
   a perfect right to put in your claim--yes, and that you ought to be
   among the most confident and the most fully assured! What a pity it is
   that you should be losing so much joy! Yet some of the most true
   children of God walk in darkness at times and we have provision made
   for them under the circumstances-- "Who is among you that fears the
   Lord, that obeys the voice of His servant, that walks in darkness, and
   has no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his
   God." Oh, that I might be the means, by His Grace, of enabling some of
   you to trust more bravely and hold to your Lord in the darkness--for
   soon that darkness would be over!

   Did I hear one mourn his faults and lament his temptations? This need
   not be a hindrance! She who first sang this priceless stanza was,
   herself, warring against enemies. Read the previous verse--"Take us the
   foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have
   tender grapes." Instead of letting go her Lord to hunt the foxes, she
   clung the more to Him and joined Him with herself in the effort to take
   them. "Foxes or no foxes," she says, "my Beloved is mine." Jesus
   belongs to us in our imperfect condition--while yet we are beset with
   many mischievous and cunning foes! The Song before us is found in our
   own Bible, which is a Book to be used on earth rather than in Heaven.
   While yet the foxes prowl around us we may sing, "My Beloved is mine,
   and I am His."

   Indeed, it is by strength derived from such a cheering confidence that
   we are enabled to kill these foxes and preserve the tender clusters of
   grapes till they are ripe for our Lord. Come, Brothers and Sisters, let
   us not do ourselves the serious hurt of refusing the greatest of
   blessings for reasons which are not valid! Let us mourn our faults, but
   let us not, therefore, forego our privileges! I will not let my Lord go
   because I see a fox. No, rather, I will cling to Him the more closely.
   If that fox should hurt my vine, yet I have a better Vine in my Lord,
   and one which no fox can touch! Away, you beasts of the field--you
   sins, doubts and fears--for my heart dares to sing, "My Beloved is
   mine, and I am His."

   I feel that I am a bearer of a tenfold portion to the Benjamin of the
   family. Joseph--I mean, Jesus--has sent it and I am eager to deliver it
   fresh from His dear hands! O trembling Believer, it is all for you!
   Receive it and eat abundantly thereof. I am under the impression that
   my Master has bid me remember that there is a Ruth here who only
   desires to glean--and she trembles while she gathers a few scanty ears.
   She has not the courage to take a sheaf, herself, but my Lord has said,
   "Let fall handfuls on purpose for her." And I would try to do so, but I
   pray that timid Ruth may have courage enough to take up what I shall
   gladly let fall for her, for the good Boaz, in whose field I serve, has
   his eyes upon her and means more kindness to her than I can tell!

   What I have to do, tonight, is to mention a few things which may help
   some timid one to say, "My Beloved is mine," and then to do the same
   with regard to the second sentence in the text, "I am His."

   You ask, perhaps, "May I say, 'My Beloved is mine?'" You know who that
   Beloved is. I have no need to tell you that. He is the chief among ten
   thousand, and the altogether lovely! You believe that it is He who is
   the ever-blessed Son of God, who became Man for our sake and, as the
   God-Man, made atonement for our sin and, having died, has risen from
   the dead and gone into His Father's within the veil where He ever makes
   intercession for us. It is that Christ who is the Light of Heaven, the
   Joy of everlasting bliss, the Adored of angels! It certainly does seem
   a great thing to call Him mine, to think that He should ever be mine,
   and that all He is, and all He has, and all He says, and all He does,
   and all He ever will be, is all mine! When a wife takes a husband to be
   hers, he becomes all hers, and she reckons that she has no divided
   possession in him. And it is certainly so with you, dear Heart, if
   Christ is yours. He is still yours and altogether yours even if it
   looks as though you were opening your mouth very wide to be able to say
   it. Some of you were brought up in a school which is full of the Law
   and you are afraid to say what the Gospel permits you to say--you have
   not yet dared to avail yourselves of your privileges! Some of God's
   heirs are often kept in the back kitchen when they have a right to sit
   in the parlor and to eat of the dainties of their Lord! Some are kept
   from the joys to which they have a fair claim, so I am going to ask you
   a few questions to see whether you are one of them.

   First, have you taken hold of Christ by faith? Faith is the hand with
   which we grasp the Lord Jesus Christ. Have you believed that Jesus is
   the Christ and that God has raised Him from the dead? Do you trust
   yourself wholly to Him? I say, "wholly"--with no other secret
   confidence. Do you lean your whole weight on Him? He that hangs on two
   branches, one of which is rotten, will go down. You had best trust your
   whole self with Christ and let Him be the top and bottom of your
   confidence. If you do that, then He is yours--this faith makes Him
   yours to your joyful experience! Listen to His own words--"God so loved
   the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in
   Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." If you believe in
   Christ, you have Christ to be your everlasting life and you may say,
   "My Beloved is mine."

   I should hope that this is not a very difficult question for you to
   answer--you are either trusting in Christ or you are not. If you are
   not trusting in Christ, God forbid that I should exhort you to say what
   would be presumptuous! But if you are resting on Him who lived, loved
   and died that He might wash us from our sins in His blood--I say, if He
   is all your salvation and all your desire, then hesitate not to say,
   "My Beloved is mine." There is no surer claim in the world than the
   claim of faith! God has given Christ to every believing sinner--be he
   who he may--God has given Christ to him by a covenant of salt and
   Christ is his, and shall be his forever! Poor Trembler, if you believe
   on Him, even you may say, "My Beloved is mine."

   Let me ask you another helpful question. Is He truly your Beloved, the
   Beloved of your soul? I remember well a dear Christian woman who
   frequently said to me, "I love Jesus, I know I do. But does He love
   me?" Her question used to make me smile. "Well," I said, "that is a
   question that I never put to myself--'If I love Him, does He love me?'
   No, the question that used to puzzle me was, 'Do I love Him?' When I
   could once settle that point, I was never again the victim of your form
   of doubt." If you love Christ, Christ loves you for sure, for your love
   to Christ is nothing more nor less than a beam out of the great sun of
   His love and the Grace that has created that love in your heart towards
   Him! If you do, indeed, love Him, proves that He loves you! Is it not
   so--"We love Him because He first loved us"? Did love ever get into the
   heart by any other door than that? I am sure that it never did! So
   that, if you love Him, you can say, "My Beloved is mine."

   There are many who may love on earth and never obtain the object of
   their affection. But if you love Christ, raise no question about His
   love to you! He is yours and you are His! That test may help someone
   who, perhaps, is standing trembling behind the door, full of blushes
   and afraid to come in among God's people. To you, poor timid Soul, we
   say, "Come in, you blessed of the Lord, why do you stand outside? If
   you love Him, you are welcome to all He has."

   Next, I would help you with a third question. Is Jesus dear to you
   above all your possessions? Perhaps you have a great deal of this
   world's goods. Do you set small store by all that you have as compared
   with Jesus? Could you see it all burn away, or melt away, or be stolen,
   rather than lose Christ? If you can say, "Yes," to that question, then
   He is yours. Perhaps you have very little--a few earthly comforts, a
   narrow room and a scant pittance to live upon--but would you sooner
   have Christ than all the riches of the world, or would you be willing
   to sell Christ in order to rise in the world? Would you sell Him that
   you might be made rich, great and famous? You who are sick--which would
   you sooner have, your sickness and Christ, or go without Christ to be
   made healthy and strong? According to your answer to these enquiries
   will be my answer to the other questions, "Are you Christ's and is
   Christ yours?" I hope that many of you can say, "O Sir, we would give
   all that we have, we would suffer all that might be suffered, we would
   part with the very light and our eyes, too, if we could but be sure
   that we might, each one, truly say, 'My Beloved is mine.'" Well, if you
   love Christ beyond all earthly things, rest assured that He is yours!

   Further, do you love Him beyond all earthly companions? Could you part
   with your dearest ones for His sake? Say, are you sure of this? Oh,
   then, He is assuredly yours! Do you love Him beyond all earthly
   objects? Yes, beyond the desire of learning, or honor, or position, or
   comfort--would you let all go for His dear sake? Many of His saints
   have had to do it and they have done it very cheerfully, and said with
   the Apostle, "Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have
   suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may
   win Christ, and be found in Him." Can you go that length? If you can,
   then surely He is yours!

   Let me further help you by another question. Is Jesus so fully your
   hope and your trust that you have no other? I have often led persons
   into liberty through that question. They have said, "I am afraid that I
   do not trust Christ." I have then asked, "Well, what do you trust?
   Every man has a reliance of some sort--what are you trusting?" When I
   have pressed them closely, they have said, "Oh, we have no other trust!
   God forbid that we ever should have!" When I have mentioned their good
   works, they have said, "Good works? Why, we would be foolish, indeed,
   to talk of them!" When I have mentioned trusting in a priest, or in
   sacraments, they have scorned the thought--it has been loathsome to
   them. Then I have said, "If you have no other trust but Christ, and you
   are sure that you have a trust somewhere, then your trust is in Christ,
   and though you may question it, and doubt it, yet if you do so trust in
   Him as to trust nowhere else, He is yours and you are His."

   There is many a good and true Believer who, nevertheless, is afraid
   that he is not a Believer. When you are once on board ship, even if the
   vessel is tossed to and fro and you, yourself, are ill, perhaps sadly
   seasick, yet as long as that ship does not go down, you will not go
   down--for your safety now does not depend upon your health and
   strength, but upon the ship into which you have entered! So, if you
   have fled to Christ away from everything else, then, though you may
   sigh, and cry, and fear, and tremble--for all of which I am sorry, for
   I would have every man on board ship to be well and strong and able to
   handle the ropes--still, if you cannot touch a rope, and if you cannot
   even eat your meals in your cabin, yet, if you are aboard the ship, and
   if that ship gets safe to land, so will you! Therefore, be of good
   cheer! O poor Heart, if you are clean divorced from every confidence
   but Christ, then I believe that you are married to Christ,
   notwithstanding that you tremble, sometimes, and ask whether it is so
   or not! Let that thought help you.

   I would further help you in this way. If Christ is yours, your thoughts
   go after Him. You cannot say that you love a person if you never think
   of him. You could not, I am sure, let another person fill your heart as
   Christ must fill His people's hearts and yet never let that person
   occupy your thoughts. He to whom Christ belongs often thinks of Him.
   "Well," says one, "I am so busy during the day that, often, my mind is
   taken up with my business and I do not think of Christ." Do you know
   where those crows live that are feeding on that plowed field? They are
   going up and down the furrows, picking up all the worms they can find.
   And as you look at them, you cannot tell where their home is, can you?
   No, but wait till evening, when the day's feeding is over--then you
   will see which way the crows fly and you will find out where their
   nests are! Do you see how quickly they are winging their way to yonder
   rookery?

   So is it with us--while we are busy in the world, picking up the worms,
   as it were, we have to think about those things. We cannot do our
   business properly without our thoughts going that way. But when the
   business is over, when the evening comes--which way do you go then?
   When you have an opportunity for thought, when your mind is going to
   its resting place--which way do your thoughts fly? That shall be the
   true test! And if, when your thoughts are set free, they fly away to
   Jesus, rest assured that He is yours! That thought may help some of you
   poor trembling ones.

   We read of the Apostles, "Being let go, they went to their own
   company." Just so. I heard a working man who was expounding that
   chapter very well. He said, "If some fellows were put in prison and
   they were let out, they would go to the first public house they see,
   for that is where they would find their company. Just so--"birds of a
   feather flock together." Now when you are let go, when your mind gets
   out of the prison of your daily business, do you go to the world for
   your pleasure? Do you go to carnal things for your mirth, or do you fly
   to Christ? If you can answer, "My thoughts go naturally to Christ,"
   then you can truly say, "My Beloved is mine."

   Again, do you do more than this? Do you long for Christ's company? If,
   "my Beloved" is, indeed, mine, I shall want to see Him! I shall want to
   speak with Him. I shall want Him to abide with me. How is it with you?
   There is a great deal of religion in the world which only consists of
   shells, or husks--the kernels are not there at all. A man goes upstairs
   and kneels down for a quarter of an hour and he says that he is
   praying, yet possibly he has not really prayed at all. Another opens
   his Bible and he reads a chapter and he says that he has been studying
   the Scriptures. Perhaps it has been a mere mechanical act and there has
   been no heart and soul in it. John Bradford, the famous martyr, used to
   say, "I have made a point of this, that I will never go from a duty
   till I have had communion with Christ in it." And, when he prayed, he
   prayed till he did really pray. When he praised, he praised till he did
   truly praise. If he was bowing in humiliation before God, he humbled
   himself till he was actually humbled. If he was seeking communion with
   Christ, he would not go away with the pleasure of merely having sought,
   but he kept on seeking until he found, for he felt that he had done
   nothing aright till he had come into communion with God and into touch
   with Christ.

   And, once more, if your Beloved is yours, you will acknowledge it to be
   so. Coming into this Tabernacle, or going down to the Communion Table,
   or gathering round the family altar--what is all that if Christ is not
   there? It should be with you as it is with a wife whose husband is far
   away across the sea. "Oh," she cries, "that I could hear the music of
   his footsteps! The rooms seem all empty now that he is away. There is
   his portrait on the wall, but it only makes me sigh the more for my
   Beloved. The very dog, as he comes in, seems to know that his master is
   away and he makes me think of him."

   Is it so with you in regard to Christ? In every duty do you sigh for
   Him and long for Him? Holy Bernard was known to say and I believe that
   he could truly say it (it was in Latin, but I will give you the English
   of it), "O my Jesus, I never went from You without You!" He meant that
   he never left his knees and left Christ behind him. He never went out
   of the house of God and left Christ behind him. But he went through the
   outward act of devotion with a consciousness of the Presence of Christ.
   Now, if this is your habit--to keep up or to labor to keep up continued
   communion with Christ, and if you are longing for more and more of that
   communion--then, dear Friends, you are His, and He is yours!

   Further, let me help you with a still closer question. Have you ever
   enjoyed that communion with Christ? Did you ever speak with Him? Have
   you ever heard His voice? I think I see you turning over the leaves of
   your diary! I hope you have not to go far back to read the record of
   your fellowship with your Lord. I hope that this morning was one
   instance of it and that this evening may be another! But are there not
   some special days, red-letter days, in your history? I recollect that
   Rutherford sent this message to one of his friends who was in great
   sorrow, "Tell him to remember Torwood." Nobody knew what was meant
   except the two who had been to Torwood where they had enjoyed such
   fellowship with Christ that they could never forget it all their days!
   That is what David meant when He said, "Therefore will I remember You
   from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, and the hill Mizar."
   Those were some choice spots that he remembered where the Lord had met
   with him!

   How can Christ be yours if you know nothing about communion with Him?
   Are you married to Him if He has never shown you His face and you have
   never heard His voice, and never spoken with Him? But if you have had
   Christ's company, He has manifested Himself to you as He does not unto
   the world. He would never have shown you such things as these if you
   were not His. Ah, have you not, sometimes, crept out of the very
   dungeon of despair and seen your Lord's blessed face--and in a moment
   you have been dancing for joy? Have you not lain on the bed of
   sickness, "weary, and worn, and sad," till His Presence has made the
   chamber of affliction bright with the light of Heaven? Have you not,
   sometimes, at the dead of night, been weary in watching for sleep that
   would not come and your Lord has come to you-- and then you have been
   afraid to go to sleep lest you should lose the joy of His Presence and
   wake up without Him?

   Oh, some of us know what that experience means--when earth has been the
   vestibule of Heaven and when, even in our sickness and sadness, we have
   been on the very verge of Jordan--and we have smelt the fragrance of
   the spices that was wafted by the breath of the Spirit from the golden
   gardens on the other side of the stream! If you know anything
   experimentally about this matter, then you may conclude that your
   Beloved is, indeed, yours!

   But supposing that you are not enjoying Christ's Presence, I am going
   to put another question to you. Are you cast down when He is away? If
   you have grieved His Spirit, are you grieved? If Christ is gone, do you
   feel as if the sun, itself, had ceased to shine and the candle of your
   existence had been snuffed out in utter darkness? Do you cry when He is
   away--

   "What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!

   How sweet their memory still!

   But now I find an aching void

   The world can never fill"? Oh, then, He is yours! If you can not bear
   His absence, He is yours!

   Last Thursday night I preached a sermon which was intended to be very
   searching one, and I hope that it was. It was upon the text, "Now if
   any man has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His." Now see the
   difficulty of a poor minister! If I preach very comforting sermons,
   there are sure to be hypocrites who suck them down and say, "How
   delightful!" But when I preach a soul-searching sermon, some dear child
   of God, who is as precious to her Lord as gold tried in the furnace,
   takes everything to herself and begins to be very sorrowful, and to
   say, "That sharp knife is meant for me, for I am not one of the Lord's
   people!"

   Well, after last Thursday night's sermon, a dear woman came to my
   vestry, broken-hearted, crying and sobbing. I hope that the discourse
   will be a blessing to her in the long run, but I assure you that I
   never meant to preach to her at all! I was not aiming at her or at the
   sort of people to whom she belongs! It was a very different class whom
   I was addressing. If the preacher says anything about hypocrites, very
   often the hypocrites will not take it to heart, but the most sincere
   saint in the congregation very likely says, "Oh, I am afraid that I am
   a hypocrite!" If you are, you are an odd sort of hypocrite, for I never
   knew of a hypocrite who was afraid that he was one! He has not Grace
   enough for that kind of fear, but just goes on in the self-conceit that
   all is right with him. I, for my part, feel more confidence in the
   broken-hearted tremblers than I do in the boasters who never have a
   question about their being all right, but set it down as an undisputed
   fact that they are in the Covenant of Grace.

   Beloved, I am glad if sometimes you moan like a dove and cry in the
   bitterness of your spirit, "Oh, that I knew where I might find Him!" It
   may seem to be a spot on your character, but this spot is the spot of
   God's children and I am not sorry to see it upon you! If the Prince
   Immanuel has left the town of Mansoul, then there can be no marriage
   bells or joyous music there until He comes back. We must invite Him and
   entreat Him to return! We must clothe ourselves in sackcloth till He
   comes back! If we do not act thus, then He is not ours. If you can do
   without Christ, you shall do without Christ--but if you cannot do
   without Him, if you cry--

   "Give me Christ, or else I die,"

   then He shall be yours! Stretch out the hand of faith and take Him, and
   then say without hesitation, "My Beloved is mine."

   1 am not going on to the rest of the text, but I want to say just
   this--if there is any man or woman here (and I know there are many),
   who can sit down in the pew and quietly say, "Yes, weighing everything
   the preacher has said, and judging myself as severely as I can, yet I
   dare take Christ to be mine and to say, 'My Beloved is mine.'" If that
   is your case, dear Friend, then you shall get confirmatory evidence of
   this fact by the witness of the Spirit within your soul which will very
   likely come to you in the form of perfect contentment of spirit,
   perfect rest of heart--

   "When I can say, 'My God is mine,'

   When I can feel Your glories shine;

   I tread the world beneath my feet,

   And all that earth calls good or great." "There," says the Believer,
   "now that my Beloved is mine, I have no other wish or need." Now will
   he be like Simeon when he took that blessed Baby into his arms. "Lord,"
   he said, "now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your
   Word." "Have you nothing more to live for, Simeon?" "No," replies the
   good old man, "what more can there be?"

   "Don't you think that if you lived a little longer, you might have a
   heavy purse of gold in your hands?" "Yes," he answers, "possibly I
   might, but it would be a cumbrous burden. This dear Child is better
   than all the gold and silver in the world. If He is mine, I have
   enough, yes, I have all!" That blessed rest of soul, which comes of a
   sure possession of Christ, is not to be imitated--but it is greatly to
   be desired!

   I know that some good people, who I believe will be saved, nevertheless
   do not attain to this sweet rest. They keep on thinking that it is
   something that they may get when they are very old, or when they are
   about to die--but they look upon the full assurance offaith and the
   personal grasping of Christ, and saying, "My Beloved is mine," as
   something very dangerous. I began my Christian life in this happy
   fashion as a boy 15 years of age. I believed fully and without
   hesitation in the Lord Jesus Christ. And when I went to see a good
   Christian woman, I was simpleton enough to tell her that I believed in
   Christ, that He was mine and that He had saved me. She said to me, "Ah,
   I don't like such assurance as that." And then she added, "I trust you
   are believing in Christ--I hope so--but I have never got beyond a hope,
   or a trust, and I am an old woman."

   Bless the old woman, but she was no example for us who know whom we
   have believed--we are to rise infinitely beyond that groveling kind of
   life! The man who begins right, and the boy who begins right, and the
   girl who begins right will begin by saying, "God has said it--'He that
   believes on Him is not condemned.' I believe on Him, therefore I am not
   condemned! Christ is mine!" O dear Friends, do not always keep on with
   that miserable hoping, and hoping, and hopping! Walk on both your feet
   and get a good firm standing on the Rock of Ages--and say without
   boasting, but without doubting--"My Beloved is mine!" This will bring
   you into the condition of the Psalmist when he said, "He makes me to
   lie down in green pastures: He leads me beside the still waters." David
   would never have said that if he had not begun the Psalm with, "The
   Lord is my Shepherd."

   If He had begun by saying, "Perhaps the Lord is my Shepherd," he would
   have gone on to say, "Perhaps there may be green pastures, possibly
   there may be still waters; but as yet my soul is in a dry and thirsty
   land where is no water and not a blade of grass." Ah, David was not so
   stupid as that! He had his times of depression, but when he was singing
   that Psalm, he was in a positive, certain frame of mind! "The Lord is
   my Shepherd." He used the indicative mood, not the subjunctive or
   conditional! The Lord help you to do the same! And you may. If Christ
   is a satisfaction to your spirit, so that your soul is satisfied as
   with marrow and fatness, then do not hesitate to say and to emphasize
   the utterance, "My Beloved is mine." He either is, or He is not--which
   is it? Do not go to sleep tonight till you know!

   If Christ is yours, Heaven is yours! If Christ is not yours, you are
   neither fit to live, nor fit to die. Remember that awful verse, "If any
   man loves not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
   Maranatha"--"let him be accursed, the Lord comes!" Take heed unto
   yourselves, therefore--if Christ is not yours, you are in terrible
   poverty! But if Christ is yours, you are eternally rich to all the
   intents of bliss! Oh, that He might be yours, now, by your stretching
   out the hand of faith and taking Him to yourself!

   "I dare not take Him," says one. Well, you are a strange person! I dare
   not let Him alone and I challenge you to shape that, "dare," into any
   other proper form. If He bids you take Him and trust Him, how dare you
   refuse Him? Take Him, now, and be safe and happy forever! God bless
   you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM63.

   This is said to be, "A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of
   Judah." I suppose, therefore, that it was composed when he fled from
   Jerusalem because of the cruel treachery of his son, Absalom. He must
   have been heart-broken, and stricken with the greatest possible sorrow
   as he fled away with his faithful followers into the wilderness of
   Judah. But even there he praised his God--and he did not sing to Him
   with old and stale Psalms, but with a new song! How restful and calm he
   must have been, in his great sorrow, to sit down, even in the
   wilderness of Judah, and make a new hymn of praise unto the Lord! How
   gloriously he begins!

   Verse 1. O God, You are my God. The Psalmist has no doubt about this
   great fact! He does not hesitate or falter, but he makes the positive
   assertion, "O God, You are my El, my mighty God, strong to deliver me."
   In the 62nd Psalm, he had finished up with the power of God--"God has
   spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongs unto God."

   So he begins this new song with the great name, El, which expresses the
   might and power of God--"O God, You are my El, my mighty God."

   1. Early will I seek You: People in the wilderness have hard beds to
   lie on and they sleep fewer hours. David was up in the morning, early,
   and he began the day with prayer to God--"Early will I seek You."
   "While the dew is on the grass, the dew of the Spirit shall be upon my
   soul." He means, also, "I will seek You at once, immediately, now,
   without delay." But how could he seek the God who was already his God?
   "You are my God; early will I seek You." Brothers and Sisters, nobody
   ever seeks another man's God. Till God is your God, you will not want
   to seek Him. But when you have Him, you will seek Him yet more and
   more!

   1. My soul thirsts for You. He had a strong passion for God. There is,
   sometimes, an unbearable, insatiable pang of the body which you cannot
   forget. And David had an insatiable longing of soul which nothing could
   make him forget-- "My soul thirsts for You."

   1. My flesh longs for You. Even his flesh, his body--not his carnal
   nature--but his body mastered by his soul, was caused to yield its
   little help towards the making of this verse--"My flesh longs for You."

   1. In a dry and thirsty land, where no water is. And this world is just
   like that. To most Christians, the six days of the week take them
   through the wilderness and the Sabbath brings them to an oasis in the
   desert, an Elim, a place where there are wells of Living Water! But oh,
   what longings they have after God! What did David want when he was in
   the wilderness?

   2. To see Your power and Your Glory, so as I have seen You in the
   sanctuary. He did not want the sanctuary so much as to see God in the
   sanctuary. Brethren, it is well to have a love to our own place of
   worship, but it is infinitely better to have a soul longing for the God
   we worship and to feel that the place of worship is nothing unless God
   is there.

   3. Because Your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall
   praise You. "In the wilderness, when my comforts are cut off, when my
   son, who was my darling, is seeking my life, my lips shall praise You,
   for still Your loving kindness is better than life."

   4. Thus will I bless You while I live. "As long as I live, I will
   praise You. Every breath of mine shall be perfumed with thankfulness
   and adoration."

   4. I will lift up my hands in Your name. "In astonishment at the power
   of Your great name, and in confidence will I lift them up when they
   have been hanging down in weakness. I will go forth in holy activity,
   with uplifted hands in Your name."

   5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness. Orientals, in
   their feasts, are very fond of fat such as you and I would hardly
   eat--they think the fat is the choicest part of their diet. So David,
   using his own metaphor, says that God would satisfy his soul as with
   the very marrow and fatness of joys.

   5. And my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips. A heart full of
   Grace makes a mouth full of praise! When God makes you inwardly to be
   content with yourself, you will be outwardly full of thanksgiving and
   praise.

   6. When I remember You upon my bed, and meditate on You in the night
   watches. Of course, in the wilderness, they had to set a watch against
   Absalom and his men. And David very likely could hear the noise in the
   camp as they changed the sentries and marked the hours of the night.
   "Oh," he said, "while I lie awake, and the watchers are on guard all
   around, I will make the night to be a time of spiritual feasting--'My
   soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fat-ness'--and I will make a
   song at night unto the God who gives songs in the night. My mouth shall
   praise You with joyful lips."'

   7. 8. Because You have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your
   wings will I rejoice. My soul follows hard after You. If he could not
   keep pace with his Lord and, in some measure lose the joy of walking
   with God, then he would run after Him. If you cannot lean on Christ's
   arm, keep close at Christ's heels! Be as near Him as you can, like a
   dog who keeps close to his master. "My soul follows hard after You."
   Where did David get the Grace and the strength to thus follow after
   God? Listen--

   8. Your right hand upholds me. There is the secret upholding of Divine
   Grace even when the soul cannot attain the fellowship at which it aims!
   When we are struggling to be near to God, let us thank the Lord who, by
   His Spirit, works in us the heavenly ardor that makes us run to Him.
   The last three verses of the Psalm describe what would become of
   David's enemies.

   9. But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower
   parts of the earth. The wicked always grovel. They never rise to higher
   things and their course shall be downward--downward to the grave,
   downward to eternal death.

   10. They shall fall by the sword. They took the sword--they shall
   perish by the sword. They were seeking to slay David--they shall be,
   themselves, slain.

   10. They shall be a portion for foxes. Not for lions, but for foxes, or
   jackals--for that is the word--the jackals shall gnaw them in pieces.

   11. But the king shall rejoice in God. David was the king, so you see
   that he did not rejoice in the slaughter of his enemies, but he did
   rejoice in his God.

   11. Everyone that swears by Him shall glory. Those who were true and
   loyal to the king would have reason for rejoicing when the rebels were
   overthrown. And those who were true and loyal to God would have still
   greater reason for exultation!

   11. But the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. Every true
   man must be glad that it is so. The mouths of liars will be stopped by
   the sexton with a shovel full of earth, if in no other way. But every
   lying tongue in all the world shall be silent, one day, at the judgment
   bar of God. The Lord bless to us the reading of his Word! Amen.

The Determination of Christ to Suffer for His People

   (No. 2443)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 15, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK.

   "And they ga ve Him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but He received
   it not."

   Mark 15:23.

   OUR Savior, before He was nailed to the Cross, and on the Cross,
   several times had drinks of different sorts offered to Him. While they
   were nailing Him to the Cross, they endeavored to make Him drink wine,
   or vinegar as it is called, mingled with gall. But when He had tasted
   of it--He did taste it--He would not drink it. When He was on the
   Cross, the soldiers, mocking Him, offered Him vinegar, or their weak
   drink of which they ordinarily partook, pledging Him in their cups with
   scorn. And once more, when He said, "I thirst," they took a sponge
   filled with vinegar, dipped it in hyssop and put it to His lips.

   This occasion of offering the wine mingled with myrrh is, I believe,
   different from all the rest. This wine mingled with myrrh was given to
   Him as an act of mercy. Matthew Henry seems to think that it was
   prepared by those holy women who were known to attend to the
   necessities of our Lord. They had followed Him in all His footsteps
   wherever He went. It was by their bounty that the bag which Judas kept
   was generally as full as it was required to be, so that out of the
   store they could go and buy food for their Master and for His
   disciples. It was these holy women who prepared the spices to embalm
   Him at His burial. And Matthew Henry thinks that these women, prompted
   by their compassion for Him, prepared this cup of wine mingled with
   myrrh that He might be strengthened for His miseries, and that those
   miseries might, in some degree--be alleviated by the partial
   stupefaction which a strong draught of wine and myrrh would give Him.

   This time our Savior positively declined the cup--"He received it not."
   The wormwood He tasted, but this He received not at all. He would have
   nothing to do with it. Why? The answer is not to be found in our
   Savior's abstemiousness, for He was not abstemious--He was never
   self-indulgent, but He certainly was never abstemious. He was "the Son
   of Man" who "came eating and drinking." He felt no repugnance to
   wine--He, Himself, made it, He Himself drank it. He even earned for
   Himself the name--"a gluttonous Man and a winebibber"--not deservedly,
   but because, in contrast to John, who abstemiously refrained from
   ordinary food, Jesus Christ sat down with publicans and sinners,
   feasted with the feasters and ate and drank like other men.

   Nor do I think the reason is to be found in any love of pain that
   Christ had, nor in any heartless bravado which would lead Him to say,
   "I will suffer and I will put the cup away from Me." Far be that from
   Christ! He never thrust Himself in the way of suffering when it was
   unnecessary. He did not go to give Himself up into the hands of His
   enemies before His hour was come. He avoided persecution when the
   avoidance of the persecution would not be an injury to His cause. He
   withdrew out of Judea and would not walk in that land because of Herod,
   who sought to slay Him. I believe that if our Savior had not been the
   atoning Sacrifice--if His sufferings had been merely those of a
   martyr--He would have quaffed to the very dregs the cup that was
   offered Him and would not have left any of it! The reason why He
   refused the cup, I think, is to be found in another thing altogether.

   There is a glorious idea couched in the fact that the Savior put the
   myrrhed wine cup entirely away from His lips. On the heights of Heaven,
   the Son of God stood of old, and He looked down and measured how far it
   was to the utmost depths of misery. He cast up the sum total of all the
   agonies which a man must endure to descend to the utmost depths of pain
   and misery. He determined that to be a faithful High Priest and, also,
   to be a suffering One, He would go the whole way, from the highest to
   the lowest, "from the highest throne in Glory to the Cross of deepest
   woe." This myrrhed cup would have stopped Him within a little of the
   utmost limit of misery and, therefore, He said, "I will not stop
   half-way,

   but I will go all the way. And if this cup can mitigate My sorrow, that
   is just the reason why I will not drink it, for I have determined that
   to the utmost lengths of misery I will go, that I will do, and bear,
   and suffer all that Incarnate God can bear for My people, in My own
   mortal body."

   Now, Beloved, it is this fact that I wish to bring out before you--the
   fact that Jesus Christ came into the world to suffer--and that because
   the myrrhed cup would have prevented Him from reaching the lowest step
   of misery, "He received it not." I shall have to show you, first, that
   this was very frequently the case throughout His life--that He would
   not take a step which would have diminished His miseries because He was
   determined to go the whole length of suffering. Secondly, I shall try
   to show you the reason for this determination. Then, thirdly, I shall
   close up by speaking of the lesson that we may learn from it.

   I. OUR SAVIOR WOULD GO THE WHOLE LENGTH OF MISERY--He would suffer in
   every respect like as we suffer. He would bear the whole of the
   tortures of Atonement without even the slightest shadow of mitigation
   or alleviation. Now, I think I can show you that on many occasions in
   Christ's life He determined to be tempted in every point in which men
   are tempted and to be tempted to the utmost limit of the power of
   temptation. Nor would He accept anything which would have limited the
   force of the temptation upon man. I will give you some proofs of this.

   First, Christ knew that you and I would be exposed to peril. He,
   therefore, determined that He would be exposed to peril, too, and that
   He would not by any means, when it was in His power, escape from the
   peril. Let me show Him to you high up there, on the pinnacle of the
   Temple. There stands our Master and a fiend by His side, on a giddy
   eminence, with but little beneath His feet. He stands poised aloft. He
   looks down the hill on which the Temple is built into the depths
   below--and the enemy says, "Cast Yourself down, commit Yourself to the
   care of the angels." It was like this myrrhed cup--"Do not stand in
   this peril, cast Yourself upon that promise and risk Yourself upon the
   angels' wings, for they shall bear You up in their hands, lest You dash
   Your foot against a stone." But like as He would not receive this cup,
   so neither would He receive this deliverance from His peril! So there
   He stood erect, confident in His God, not using the means of
   deliverance which the tempter wished Him to exercise, even as He would
   not drink this cup!

   Take another case--Jesus Christ knew that many of His people would have
   to suffer bodily needs, poverty and woe. He therefore hungered. After
   forty days' fast, when He might have delivered Himself from His hunger
   by turning stones into bread, one would have said, "It would have been
   a very innocent act to turn stones into bread and feed Himself." But,
   "No," says Christ to the gnawing pangs of hunger, "I will let you go as
   far as you can. I will not turn these stones into bread. I will let
   hunger exercise all its power upon Me. I will let My body be gnawed by
   its fierce teeth! I will not mitigate its misery." He would not receive
   that wine mingled with myrrh that the devil offered Him in the
   wilderness when he tempted Him to make the stones into bread--He would
   not take the lessening of His misery!

   I will tell you another instance. Many men have attempted to have their
   lives cut short because they have so much misery and no more hope of
   being happy. They, therefore, have wished for death. They have wished
   that they might be as the untimely birth, that they might be forever
   shut up in the bowels of the earth. They have longed for death and
   desired it--and if an opportunity had cast itself in their way in which
   they might have died with honor, without having the disgrace of
   suicide--how many would have accepted the alternative of death! Here is
   our Savior in the same condition, for He is dragged to the brow of the
   hill of Nazareth. O Son of Man, Your wisest choice is to be dashed down
   the sides of the hill on which the city is built! If You are wise, You
   will let them hurl You headlong--that would be an end of all Your
   misery, for there are years before You through which You will be
   roasted at the slow fire of persecution! And afterwards You will have
   to pass through floods of deepest misery! Do you not think the
   temptation started up in His mind, "Let Yourself be cast down"? He knew
   all about it. Had He been cast down, He would have died an honorable
   death like the death of a Prophet slain in his own country--but no,
   "passing through the midst of them, He went His way," because, as He
   refused the wine cup, so He refused a hasty death which would have
   delivered Him from His miseries.

   Do you not observe that I have only just given you specimens? You will
   find that all through the Savior's life it was just the same. You will
   not find Him in one instance working a miracle to lessen His own bodily
   fatigue, or to alleviate His own bodily needs and necessities, but
   always letting the ills of this life wreak themselves upon Him with all
   their fury! He hushed the winds, once, but it was for His disciples,
   not for Himself. He lay asleep in the boat and let the waves toss Him
   up and down as much as they pleased! He multiplied the loaves and
   fishes, but it was for the multitude, not for Himself. He could find
   money in a fish's mouth, but it was to pay the tribute, not for
   Himself. He could scatter mercies wherever He went--open men's eyes,
   and deliver many of them from pains--but He never exercised any of His
   skill upon Himself. If the wind blew, He let it spend itself upon His
   cheeks and crack them. If the cold was bitter, He let the cold come
   round Him as it did in the Garden of Gethsemane. If journeying was
   troublesome, He journeyed where He might have traveled as His Father
   did--as old Thomas Sternhold says in his fine translation of the
   Psalms--

   "The Lord descended from above,

   And bowed the heavens most high,

   And underneath His feet He cast

   The darkness of the sky.

   On cherub and on cherubim

   Full royally He rode,

   And on the wings of mighty winds

   Came flying all abroad."

   So might Jesus, if He pleased, but He journeyed on in weariness. He
   might have made the water leap out of the well to His hands, but there
   He sat and thirsted, while He had power to make fountains gush even
   from the stone on which He sat! On the Cross, "I thirst," was His cry
   and yet, if He pleased, He might have opened in Himself rivers of
   living water-- He had them for others, but He had none for Himself. You
   will observe this fact that in all the history of Christ, never once
   did He take anything which could have lessened His miseries--He went
   the whole length--and as on this occasion He refused the wine drugged
   with myrrh and, so never did He receive anything that had a tendency to
   prevent Him from going to the requisite lengths of suffering.

   II. Now let me show you THE REASON FOR THIS. Was it out of any love to
   suffering that He thus refused the wine cup? Ah, no, Christ had no love
   of suffering. He had a love of souls, but like we, He turned away from
   suffering. He never loved it. We see He did not, for even in the garden
   He said, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me." It was
   His Human Nature struggling against suffering, as human nature
   rightfully does--God has made us so that we do not naturally love
   suffering--and it is not wrong for us to feel some repugnance to it,
   for God has implanted that repugnance in us. Christ did not suffer
   because He loved suffering. Why, then, did He suffer? For two
   reasons--because this suffering to the utmost was necessary to the
   completion of the Atonement, which saves to the utmost, and because
   this suffering to the utmost was necessary to perfect His Character as
   "a merciful High Priest" who has to care for souls that have gone to
   the utmost of miseries themselves--that He might know how to succor
   them that are tempted.

   First, I say it was necessary to make the Atonement complete. I think
   that if our Savior had drunk this myrrhed cup, the Atonement would not
   have been valid. It strikes me that if He had drunk this wine mingled
   with myrrh, He could not have suffered to the extent that was
   absolutely necessary. We believe Christ did, on the Cross, suffer just
   enough, and not one particle more than was necessary for the redemption
   of His people. If, then, this wine cup had taken away a part of His
   sufferings, the ransom price would not have been fully complete--it
   would not have been fully paid. And if it had but taken away so much as
   a grain, the Atonement would not have been sufficiently satisfactory.
   If a man's ransom is to be paid, it must be all paid, for though but
   one single farthing is left unpaid, the man is not fully redeemed and
   he is not yet totally free. If, then, this drinking of the wine cup had
   taken out the smallest amount from that fearful price of agony which
   our Savior paid, the Atonement would have been insufficient only to a
   degree, but even insufficiency to a degree, however small, would have
   been enough to have caused perpetual despair, yes, enough to have shut
   the gates of Heaven against all Believers! The utmost farthing must be
   paid! Relentless Justice has never yet omitted so much as a fraction of
   its claim! Nor would it, in this case, have relented in any
   measure--Christ must pay it all! The wine cup would have prevented His
   doing that, therefore He would suffer and go the whole length of
   suffering! He would not stop, but would go through it all.

   Again, I say it was that He might be made a compassionate High Priest.
   Someone might have said, "When my Master died, He did not suffer much.
   He suffered somewhat, but the wine cup prevented much suffering. I dare
   not touch the wine cup--at least, I dare not take it so as to alleviate
   my sufferings at all--then I must suffer more than He, for that drugged
   wine I must not drink. Surely, then, my Master cannot sympathize with
   me, if I, for conscientious motives, bear suffering without accepting
   alleviations which some think are wrong." "No," said the Master, "no,
   you shall never say that! If you have to suffer without a comfort, I
   will let you know that I suffered without a comfort, too." You say,
   "Oh, if I had some myrrh given me which could mitigate my woe, it would
   all be well!" "Ah," says the Savior, "but I have had it offered to Me
   and I will not drink it in order that you may see that I suffered woe
   without the comfort, without the cordial, without the consolation which
   you think would enable you to endure it."

   O blessed Lord Jesus, You were "tempted in all points like as we are"!
   Blessed be Your name! This myrrh cup could have put a plate of steel
   upon Your breast! It would have blunted many darts of suffering and,
   therefore, You put it aside that You might, naked, suffer every shaft
   to find its target in Your heart! This myrrh cup would have steeled
   Your feelings so that You could not be torn by the whips of anguish
   and, therefore, You would not take its steeling influence, its
   hardening qualities. You, who did stoop to become a poor, weak worm, "a
   worm and no man," did bear the agony without making the agony less, or
   strengthening Your own body to bear it, O blessed High Priest!

   Go to Him, you tried and tempted ones! Go to Him and cast your burdens
   on Him--He can bear them! He has borne burdens heavier than yours! Cast
   your burden on the Lord, as His shoulders can sustain it! And His
   shoulders, that have borne trouble without comfort, can bear your
   troubles, though they are comfortless ones, too! Do but tell them to
   your Master and you shall never find a lack of sympathy in Him.

   III. And now, what have we to say by way of A LESSON for this short
   discourse?

   When Christ was offered this cup, He would not receive it. Sometimes,
   Beloved, it is in your power to escape from sufferings for Christ's
   sake--and you may rightly do so if you can escape from them without
   injuring the mission upon which your Father has sent you--for as He
   sent His Son into the world, even so has He sent you into the world.
   You have your mission and there are times when the acceptance of a
   cordial, or the reception of an escape from peril, would be a
   degradation to your high dignity, an injury to your office and,
   therefore, there are times when you should decline even the cup of
   consolation, itself. You and I are called to hold fellowship with
   Christ in His sufferings. Perhaps our business places us where we have
   to hold fellowship with Christ in the suffering of contempt. The finger
   is pointed at us. The lips are sometimes protruded in derision.
   Sometimes an expression is used towards us, calling us a hypocrite, a
   cant, a formalist. You may be apt to think, "Oh, that I could avoid all
   this! I wish I could escape." Can you avoid it and serve your Master,
   as well? If you can, then drink the myrrh cup, and avoid the misery!
   But if you cannot--and if it is proven that your position is one of
   duty and one in which you can honor your Master--it is at your peril
   that you exchange your situation for an easier one, if you exchange it
   for one less useful!

   "Oh," says one, "I work among wicked men and I have to bear a testimony
   for the Truth of God in their midst. May I not leave the place at once?
   I feel that I am doing good, there, but the jeers and taunts are so
   hard to bear that the good I do seems to be always counterbalanced by
   the misery I suffer." Take care, take care, lest you let the flesh
   prevail over the spirit! It would be like a myrrh cup to you, for you
   to leave your job and go to another! It would be the removal of your
   pain, but ponder a long time before you do it, weigh it well. If your
   Maker has put you there, to suffer for His name's sake, come not down
   from the cross to which He has nailed you by a daily crucifixion till
   you have suffered all! And take not the myrrh cup of an escape until
   you have borne all for Christ. I think it was holy Polycarp who, when
   the soldiers came to him to take him to prison, made his escape. But
   when he found, afterwards, that his doing so had dispirited some
   Christians and had been attributed to his cowardice--when next the
   soldiers presented themselves and he had an opportunity to escape,
   "No," he said, "let me die." It had been foolhardy of him if he had run
   into the teeth of men, the first time, in order to be put to death. But
   when he saw that he would serve His Master better by His death than by
   His life, it would have been an unrighteous thing if He had drunk of
   the wine cup--if he had made his escape and not died for his Master's
   sake.

   O my Brothers and Sisters, I think that there are many cordials which
   the world, too, has to offer to the Christian which he must not drink
   because if his Master wishes him to have fellowship with Him in His
   suffering, it is his to suffer so far as his Master wills! You are,
   perhaps, a man or a woman of a sorrowful spirit. You are given to
   solitude and loneliness. There are certain amusements which some men
   say are harmless--they tell you that they are meant for you and ask you
   to go and take them. You think, "Well, in my low state, surely I might
   take these things. If I were happy and joyous, I should not need them,
   but surely my Father, 'like as a father pities his children,' will pity
   me. And if I do these things, I do them merely for temporary comfort,
   for my heart seems as though it would break if I had not this little
   temporary excitement."

   Take care, take care that it is not the wine cup that prevents you, my
   Friends! If your Master gives you the wine cup, the golden wine cup
   filled with the precious wine of the Covenant, the strong promises and
   sweet fellowship in Christ,

   drink it without a moment's hesitation! Drink it and be glad, for God
   has said, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish," and
   this is the strong drink He gives to you in the golden wine cup of the
   Savior's fellowship. Drink it and be happy! But if men offer it to you,
   look long and hard before you drink it! It may be you may be right in
   drinking it--it may not be a wrong thing--but it may be, too, that even
   a thing that is innocent to others, may be wrong to you! And the taking
   of that amusement and pleasure into your hands might be like our
   Savior's taking the myrrh cup and drinking it. It would be a
   stultifying of you, a preventing you from learning all the lessons of
   your misery, from going in all the steps of your Redeemer who wishes us
   to follow Him through all the miseries which He has ordained for us,
   that they may be the means of fellowship with Him in His suffering.

   This is the only lesson I desire to give you at this time. If the Lord
   impresses it on our minds, it may be of use to us. Only let me say how
   many there are who would have drunk this wine cup if it had been
   offered to them! Your Savior has taken from you the desire of your eyes
   with a stroke! He has robbed you of one who is dear and near to you.
   Say, Christian, if you had had the myrrh cup put before you, if it had
   been said, "If you like, that loved one of yours shall live." If it had
   been offered to you that the life that has been taken away should be
   spared--could you, with fortitude, have said, "Not my will, but Yours,
   be done"? Could you have put it away and said, "No, my Master, if this
   cup may not pass from me except I drink it, Your will be done. And what
   is more, if it may pass from me, if I need not the suffering, yet if I
   can honor You more by suffering, and if the loss of my beloved one will
   serve You and please You, then so let it be. I refuse the comfort when
   it comes in the way of Your honor. I reject the favored mercy if it
   comes in the teeth of Your Glory. I am willing to suffer-- I care not
   for Your consolations if I can honor You better without them"?

   There are some among you in the time of mourning. Let me just, in
   conclusion, note a very beautiful thought of a good man on a passage of
   Scripture. Jesus says in His prayer, "Father, I will that they, also,
   whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am." Do you know why good
   men die? Do you know why the righteous die? Shall I tell you what it is
   that kills them? It is Christ's prayer--"Father, I will that they be
   with Me." It is that that fetches them up to Heaven! They would stay
   here if Christ did not pray them to death! Every time a Believer mounts
   from this earth to Heaven, it is caused by Christ's prayer. "Now," says
   this good old Divine, "many times Christ and His people pull against
   one another in prayer. You bend your knees in prayer and say, 'Father,
   I will that they whom You have given me be with me where I am.' Christ
   bends His knees and says, 'Father, I will that they whom You have given
   Me be with Me where I am.'"

   So, you see, one gets hold of him, and the other, too. He cannot be in
   both places! The beloved one cannot be with Christ and with you, too!
   Now, what shall be the answer? Put the prayers side by side. You are
   praying, "Father, I will that they whom you have given me be with me
   where I am." And there is your Savior, praying that they may be with
   Him where He is. Now, if you had your choice--if the King should step
   from His Throne and say, "Here are two supplicants. They are praying
   opposite to one another--their prayers are clearly contrary to each
   other--I cannot answer them both." Oh, I am sure, though it were agony,
   you would start from your feet, and say, "Jesus, not my will, but Yours
   be done." You would give up your prayer for your sick husband's life,
   for your sick wife's life, for your dying child's life, if you could
   realize the thought that Christ was praying in the opposite direction,
   "Father, I will that they whom You have given Me be with Me where I
   am."

   And now we come to the Supper of our Master! Oh, may the Master give us
   fellowship with Him! Poor sinners that know not Christ, I have hardly a
   moment in which to address you, but remember, the separation which will
   be made between you and the Church, tonight, is but a picture of an
   awful separation which shall be made between you and the Church at the
   Last Great Day! You will sit upstairs, some of you, to look down upon
   the solemnity--remember, you may look upon it here, but you will not
   look upon it in Heaven unless your hearts are made new by Christ and
   unless you are washed in His precious blood!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MARK 15:15-39; LUKE23:27-49.

   We will read two short passages from the Gospels this evening. May the
   blessed Spirit, who taught the Evangelists to record the sad story of
   our Lord's sufferings and death, help us to fully enter into the
   blessed meaning of it while we read it! First turn to Mark 15, verse
   15.

   Mark 15:15, 16. And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released
   Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged Him, to be
   crucified. And the soldiers led Him away into the hall, called
   Praetorium. The guard room of Herod's palace, where the Praetorian
   guards were known to gather.

   16-20. And they called together the whole band. And they clothed Him
   with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about His head,
   and began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote Him on
   the head with a reed, and spit upon Him, and bowing their knees
   worshipped Him. And when they had mocked Him. To the utmost, and gone
   the full length of their cruel scorn!

   20-23. They took off the purple from Him, and put His own clothes on
   Him, and led Him out to crucify Him. And they compelled one Simon, a
   Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of
   Alexander and Rufus, to bear His Cross. And they brought Him unto the
   place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. And
   they gave Him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but He received it not.
   They did for Him what they did for others who were crucified-- they
   gave Him myrrhed wine, as a stupefying draught--"but He received it
   not." He came to suffer and He would bear, even to the end, the full
   tale of His suffering.

   24-27. And when they had crucified Him, they parted His garments,
   casting lots upon them, what every man should take. And it was the
   third hour, and they crucified Him. And the superscription of His
   accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. And with Him they
   crucified two thieves; the one on His right hand, and the other on His
   left. They gave Him the place of eminence, as if He were a greater
   offender than either of the two thieves!

   28. And the Scripture was fulfilled, which says, And He was numbered
   with the transgressors. Sinners to the right of Him, sinners to the
   left of Him, sinners all round Him--compassed about with those who
   sinned in the very highest degree by putting Him to death. "He was
   numbered with the transgressors." Oh, that sweet word! It is the hope
   of transgressors, now, that He was counted with them! And for His sake
   all the blessings of Heaven now descend upon transgressors who accept
   Him as their Substitute and Savior!

   29. And they that passed by railed on Him. Not only those who sat down
   to gloat their cruel eyes upon His miseries, but even the passers-by,
   "They that passed by, railed on Him."

   29, 30. Wagging their heads and saying, Ah, You that destroys the
   Temple, and builds it in three day, save Yourself, and come down from
   the Cross. He never said He would destroy the literal Temple. He did,
   however, say concerning the Temple of His body, "Destroy this Temple,
   and in three days I will raise it up," and He did raise it up in three
   days after they had destroyed it!

   31. Likewise also the chiefpriests mocking said among themselves with
   the scribes, He saved others; Himself He cannot save. What they said in
   bitter scorn was true, for mighty love had bound His hands from
   self-salvation. Infinite in love, found guilty of excess of love to
   men, "He saved others; Himself He could not save."

   32, 33. Let Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the Cross,
   that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with Him
   reviled Him. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over
   the whole land until the ninth hour. A supernatural darkness which
   could not have occurred according to the laws of Nature. It did, as it
   were, "set a tabernacle for the sun"--the Sun of Righteousness was
   canopied for a while in darkness, that no longer might those horrible
   eyes gaze upon His terrible anguish!

   34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi,
   Eloi, lama Sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, My God,
   why have You forsaken Me? There was a denser darkness over His spirit
   than was over all the land--and out of that darkness came this cry of
   agony!

   35. And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold,
   He calls Elijah. Ah, me! This was either a cruel jest upon our Savior's
   prayer or an utter misapprehension of it!

   36. And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a
   reed, and gave Him to drink, saying, Let Him alone; let us see whether
   Elijah will come to take Him down. Jesus did receive this vinegar and
   so fulfilled Psalm 69:21--"In My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink."

   37. 38. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. And
   the veil of the Temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. Even
   as the flesh of Christ, which is the veil of the Incarnate God, was
   rent, so now was the veil of mystery taken away! The Temple in her
   sorrow rent her veil. The old Ceremonial Law passed away with this
   token of grief by the rending of the veil! It was a strong--I might
   say, a massive veil--it could not have been torn by any ordinary means,
   but when the hand of God takes hold upon the veil of Jewish types, they
   readily tear and, into the innermost mystery of the Holy of Holies, we
   may gaze, yes, and through it we may enter!

   39. And when the centurion, which stood over against Him, saw that He
   so cried out, and gave up the ghost, He said, Truly this Man was the
   Son of God. Convinced by the Cross! Oh, the triumphs of Christ! The
   last word He speaks won this testimony from the centurion in charge of
   the Crucifixion! Now we will read part of Luke's narrative.

   Luke 23:27-31. And there followed Him a great company of people, and of
   women, which also bewailed and lamented Him. But Jesus, turning unto
   them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for Me, but weep for
   yourselves, and for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, in
   the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that
   never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they begin
   to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if
   they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
   Our Savior, even amidst the greatest sufferings, seemed almost to
   forget His suffering in the deep sympathy that He had for the people
   around Him! He pictured in His mind's eye that awful siege of
   Jerusalem. Who can read it, as Josephus describes it, without feeling
   the deepest horror? Oh, the misery of the women and of the children in
   that dreadful day when the zealots turned against each other within the
   city and fought to the death! And when the Roman soldiers, pitiless as
   wolves, at last stormed the place! Truly did the Savior say of it that
   there would be no day like it--neither was there--it was the
   concentration of human misery and our Lord wept because He foresaw what
   it would be. And He bade these poor women reserve their tears for those
   awful sorrows.

   32, 33 And there were also two others, malefactors, led with Him to be
   put to death. And when they were come to the place, which is called
   Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the malefactors, one on the
   right hand, and the other on the left. O blessed Master they did not
   spare You any scorn! There was no mode of expressing their contempt
   which their malignity did not invent! Truly, "He was numbered with the
   transgressors." You could not count the three sufferers on Calvary
   without counting Him--He was so completely numbered with the others
   that He must be reckoned as one of them!

   34. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
   do. It was all that He could say in their favor, and He did say that.
   If there is anything to be said in your favor, O my fellow Sinner,
   Christ will say it! And if there is nothing good in you that His eyes
   can light upon, He will pray on His own account--"Father, forgive them
   for My sake."

   34. And they parted His raiment, and cast lots. His garments were the
   executioners' perquisites. Pitilessly they took them from Him and left
   Him naked in His shameful sorrow.

   35. And the people stood beholding. There was no pity in their eyes.
   Not one of them turned away his face because he could not look upon so
   disgraceful a deed.

   35. And the rulers also with them derided Him, saying, He saved others;
   let Him save Himself, if He is Christ, the chosen of God. I have
   already reminded you that there was a deep truth hidden away in what
   these cruel mockers said, for Jesus must give Himself up as a ransom if
   we were to be redeemed.

   36-38. And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him, and offering
   Him vinegar, and saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save
   Yourself. And a superscription also was written over Him in letters of
   Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, For these were the three languages known
   to the throng, and Pilate invited them all to read in "Greek, and
   Latin, and Hebrew."

   38,39. THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors which
   were hanged railed on Him, saying, If You are Christ, save Yourself and
   us. Poor man, even though he is dying a felon's death, he must be in
   the swim with the multitude! He must keep in with the fashion so
   strong, so powerful--it is the popular current with all mankind!

   40-42. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear
   God, seeing you are in the same condemnation? And we, indeed, justly,
   for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this Man has done
   nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come
   into Your Kingdom. It was strange that Christ should find a friend
   dying on the cross by His side. Nobody else spoke to Him about a
   Kingdom. I am afraid that even His former followers began to think that
   it was all a delusion. But this dying thief cheers the heart of Jesus
   by the mention of a Kingdom and by making a request to Him concerning
   that Kingdom even when the King was in His death agony!

   43. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto you, Today shall you be
   with Me in Paradise. The Master, you see, uses His old phraseology. In
   His preaching He had been accustomed to say, "Verily, verily," and here
   He is, even on the Cross,

   still the same Preacher, for there was such assurance, such confidence,
   such Truth, in all His words, that He never had to alter His style of
   speaking! "Verily I say unto you, Today shall you be with Me in
   Paradise." Well does our poet put it--

   "He that distributes crowns and thrones, Hangs on a tree and bleeds and
   groans." He was distributing these crowns and thrones even while
   hanging on the tree! "Tell it among the nations that the Lord reigns
   from the tree," may not be an exact translation of the Psalm, but it is
   true, Psalm or no Psalm! 44. And it was about the sixth hour. About
   noon, when the sun was at its height.

   44. And there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
   Three o'clock in the afternoon.

   45. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the Temple was rent in
   the midst. As if the great light of Heaven and the pattern of heavenly
   things were both disturbed. The sun puts on mourning and the Temple
   rends her veil in horror at the awful deed enacted on the Cross!

   46. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said, Father--Is it
   not sweet to see how Jesus begins and ends His prayers on the Cross
   with, "Father"?

   46-48. Into Your hands I commend My spirit: and having said thus, He
   gave up the ghost. Now when the centurion saw what was done, he
   glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous Man. And all the
   people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which
   were done, smote their breasts and returned. A strange ending to that
   day, was it not? The three hours' darkness and the death cry of the
   Christ had not converted them, but it had convicted them of sin. They
   felt that a great and heinous crime had been committed and, though they
   had come together as to a mere show or sight, they went away from the
   spectacle impressed as they had never been before--"All the people that
   came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done,
   smote their breasts, and returned."

   49. And all His acquaintances and the women that followed Him from
   Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. In these doings on
   Calvary you and I have a share--in their guilt, or else in their merit.
   Oh, that we may not be condemned with those who were guilty of His
   death, but may we be cleansed by that precious blood which puts away
   the sin of all who believe on Him!

Cheering Words

   (No. 2444)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 22, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you: continue you in My
   love." John 15:9.

   THE Savior was about to leave His disciples and this was the hardest
   trial which they had ever experienced. As there could be no trial to
   them like the loss of the Savior's Presence, it was at this time Jesus
   brought forth His richest consolation. He seems to have kept the best
   wine and the most potent cordial till the time when their spirits most
   required to be comforted. He said to them more fully than He had ever
   said it before, "Take this for your comfort--live upon it while I am
   absent from you. Live upon it always--that as the Father has loved Me,
   so have I loved you."

   But what is this richest of all cordials? What is this marrow and
   fatness? It is the assurance of His love to us and surely there cannot
   be a more delightful thought that can fill the soul of a mortal than
   this--"The Son of God loves me." Did you ever sit down for half an hour
   and try to masticate and digest this thought? That God should pity me,
   I can understand, being so far inferior to Himself and so full of
   misery. That He should be generous to me, I can comprehend, from the
   liberality and bounty of His Nature and from my great necessities. But
   that He should love me is amazing! I cannot see anything lovely in
   myself and there are many who see that there is much ugliness about
   me--and I do not doubt that there is--and yet He who knows me better
   than I know myself and is not unmindful of my infirmities and
   weaknesses says He loves me! He does not put me at arm's length and
   then feed me from His bounty--that would be gracious--He opens wide His
   bosom and takes me into His heart! He closes the golden doors and takes
   me in to dwell forever, that in the ivory palaces I may be made glad
   with the cassia and the aloes of His delightful Presence!

   Man, did you ever get this into you soul? Then though you may be
   clothed in rags, you will feel as though you were wrapped about with
   imperial purple! Although you may dwell in a very poor and lonely
   cottage, when this thought shines upon you, you would not change your
   cottage for a palace! Unto which of the angels did He ever say this? I
   believe angels are the subjects of Divine Love in a certain sense, but
   I have never read of Christ saying to them, "As the Father has loved
   Me, so have I loved you." This is the special privilege for the sons of
   Adam who have fallen which angels never have. How marvelous! And is it
   not more than marvelous, that God should have selected me out of the
   sons of Adam? Perhaps there is nothing in any of you which you can look
   upon as a reason why God should love you. Did I say, "perhaps"? Why,
   there are 10,000 things about every one of us that might have won for
   us the Almighty's hatred! Instead of this, He says He loves us, His
   people! Surely, if I were to say no more, but sit down and leave you to
   think over the fact that God loves you and that your name is dear to
   Jehovah, your souls might be satisfied as with marrow and fatness!

   The text, itself, clearly contains two things--a declaration and an
   exhortation.

   I. THE DECLARATION is like a door on two hinges and on these the text
   swings. The hinges are, "as," and, "so"--"As the Father has loved Me,
   so have I loved you." What if I call them two diamond pivots upon which
   the pearly gate of Love turns to shut in God's people?

   These words may be viewed in four lights. The word, "as," is used here
   for the sake of affirmation. The Savior does as much as say, in the
   most solemn manner possible, to His believing people, "I love you and I
   love you as surely as My Father loves Me." There are a great many new
   doctrines starting up, nowadays, and perhaps tomorrow morning there
   will be another. New opinions are constantly coming up, but I do not
   remember ever hearing anybody say that the Father does not love the
   Son. Whatever new heresies there may be--and there will be plenty of
   them--I do not suppose that this will ever be the subject of heresy. It
   is so firmly believed, that I never heard a sermon preached to prove
   it--it is a doctrine taken for granted and laid hold of as being an
   elementary Truth of the Christian system. Jesus Christ, then, says,

   "You do not doubt that the Father loves Me. Now, just as surely as the
   Father loves Me, I say, solemnly and truly, that I love you." He says
   this to each of us who trusts in Him--to all of you poor, troubled
   Christians who have so many cares that you would not like to count
   them--you to whom it was whispered, the other day--

   "The Lord has quite forsaken you--

   Your God will be gracious no more." "No," says Jesus, "you do not think
   that the Father has cast Me off, or ceased to love Me? Then do not
   think that I have cast you off, or ceased to love you. You are the
   purchase of My blood and as surely as the Father loves Me, so do I
   still love you."

   This, "as," may not only be regarded as an affirmation, but also what
   is very near akin to it, a confirmation. In order to strengthen their
   faith, God has been pleased to give His people not merely His Word, but
   tokens and signs to confirm His Word. When Noah had been delivered from
   the flood by means of an ark, he might still have been very timid at
   the first shower of rain and have been afraid that the world was going
   to be drowned, again. But to remove any fears he might have had, lo,
   there appears in the heavens God's rainbow, a bow of many colors,
   illustrating the joy which there should be in the hearts of those with
   whom God had made a Covenant! Not a black bow as though it were bent on
   destruction, nor a crimson bow as though it were dipped in blood--but a
   rainbow of many colors, a bow turned upwards, not shooting the arrows
   of vengeance upon mankind, but hinting to us that we may shoot our
   prayers up to Heaven--a bow unstrung and a bow without an arrow to show
   that God had ceased from warring with His creatures and had made peace
   with man. As soon as Noah saw that rainbow, he said, "I shall not be
   drowned, the world will not be destroyed by a flood!"

   God also gave His servant, David, a sign when He told him that as long
   as the sun and moon should shine in their places, He would not break
   His Covenant with David. The rainbow is a very sweet sign, but we
   cannot always see it. And the sun and moon are not always visible, so
   the Lord has been pleased to give to His people a sign which is always
   visible, a symbol which is good by day and by night, and which is not
   dependent upon raindrops and sunbeams. The Christian, by the eyes of
   faith, can always look up to Heaven and see Christ in the bosom of His
   Father! You have no doubt, I am sure, that Christ is the object of
   Divine affection. You can see it clearly and there is no doctrinal
   error at all clouding your view of the love of the Father for His Son.
   Now this is, to me, the token that Jesus Christ loves me! I look up and
   see Jesus resting in His Father's heart--and I, a poor sinner, resting
   upon Jesus and finding all my help in Him--know that

   I am in Christ's heart and that nothing shall ever pluck me from it. I
   know this because I have the sign that, "as" the Father loves the Son,
   "so" Christ loves me. May God give us Grace to see and rejoice in this,
   "as," of confirmation!

   But perhaps the fullness of this meaning lies in the fact that this is
   an, "as," and a, "so," of comparison. I think the text means that in
   the same way as the Father loves the Son, just in the same way Jesus
   loves His people. And how does the Father love the Son? He loved Him
   without beginning! You meet with strange people, sometimes, but I do
   not recollect ever meeting with anyone who thought that God the Father
   did not, at some time or other, love the Son. It is commonly and
   currently believed among all who accept the Bible as true, that from
   everlasting to everlasting the love of God is set upon His Son. We
   believe that long "before worlds were made or time began" the Lord
   Jesus Christ was dear to His eternal Father. Now, as the Father loves
   Christ, so Christ loves us and, therefore, He loves us without
   beginning! Long before the lamps of Heaven were kindled, or the stars
   began to twinkle in the sky--when as yet all this world slept in the
   mind of God as unborn forests sleep within the acorn--we were in the
   heart of Christ!

   When we rest upon Christ, we may be infallibly certain that His
   foreseeing eyes beheld us and that His foreloving heart loved us when
   as yet we had no being! In the book wherein all His members were
   written, which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there were
   none of them, there He read our names, our forms, our lineaments. He
   saw our characters and knew our sins--

   "He saw us ruined in the Fall, Yet loved us, notwithstanding all." You
   can go back to the beginning of human affection--you can easily go back
   to the beginning of your love to God, but God's love to us is a deep
   which has no bottom--

   "The streams of love I trace up to their Fountain--God! And in His
   mighty breast I see

   Eternal thoughts of love to me."

   And I suppose we all believe that the Father loves His Son without end.
   You have no idea, I suppose, that at any time the Father will cease to
   love His own dear Son. You cannot suppose such a thing--your mind can
   hardly conjure up such a blasphemous thought as that there should ever
   be a division among the Persons of the Trinity and that Jesus Christ
   should be driven from His Father's heart! "Now," says Christ, "as the
   Father has loved Me, so have I loved you," that is, without end--

   "Once in Christ, in Christ forever! Nothing from His love can sever."
   This is a great and precious Truth of God, but I know some people who
   use it very badly, for they say, "I was in Christ once and, therefore,
   I must be in Christ now." But that is not the question! If you were
   once in Christ, you are in Christ now--but can you really and truly say
   that you are in Christ now? Are you now resting upon Him? Are you now
   walking in His ways? Are you now reflecting His image? Are you now
   trusting that His Spirit dwells in you? If not, I do not care what you
   say about having been once in Christ, for I do not believe that unless
   you are in Christ now! This Truth, which you use as a buttress for your
   presumption, should rather be used as a stimulus to self-examination!
   Remember, it is written, "But if any man draws back, My soul shall have
   no pleasure in him." And if you have drawn back, you have given clear
   proof that His soul has no pleasure in you, for they who are in Christ
   Jesus are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation--they
   are preserved by Christ Jesus--they are sanctified by His indwelling
   Spirit and their path, according to Solomon, "is as the shining light,
   that shines more and more unto the perfect day." God grant that we may
   prove our calling by our perseverance!

   Let us, just for a moment, suck in the Truth of this very precious
   doctrine that, as surely as the Father will always continue to love
   Jesus Christ, so Jesus Christ will always continue to love us. Some of
   us, perhaps, look forward to old age without expecting any great
   delight in it. There are times when the grinders fail because they are
   few and they that look out of the windows are darkened. But, Saint, you
   need not fear the loosing of the silver cord, for your God shall never
   change--His eyes shall not wax dim--His natural force shall never
   abate! If you should be bowed double with infirmity, yet remember that
   the everlasting God faints not, neither is weary and His love for you
   will never cease! Perhaps at times we look forward to death with a sort
   of shiver. I know that there are seasons when even the very best of
   God's servants do not find death the sweetest possible subject for
   contemplation, but I do not think that any of us who believe in Jesus
   have the slightest reason to be afraid to die. On the contrary, we may
   rejoice in it, for our Savior will not leave us in the hour of death.
   Still is He in the Father's bosom and still shall we be there even when
   the chill floods are about us and the crashing of the eternal waves
   shall be sounding in our ears! Rest confident, Christian, that even
   down to the grave, Christ will go with you and that up, again, from it,
   He will be your Guide and your Companion to the Celestial

   Hills!

   I am sure you are all perfectly agreed, too, that God the Father loves
   Jesus Christ without any change. You do not believe, as instructed
   disciples, that the Father loved Jesus Christ more, at one time, than
   at another. It is our belief that when Christ said, "My God, My God,
   why have You forsaken Me?" He was still as dear to His Father's heart
   as He ever had been. There was a hiding of His face from His Son, but
   not a turning away of His heart! Can you suppose that His Father loved
   Him the least when He was most obedient? When He was obedient unto
   death and fulfilled His Father's will at all hazards in the awful
   darkness, do you think that, then, the Father's heart was cold and
   stony towards Him? Oh, no! It was but a change of manifestation, but
   His inward love was still the same!

   Now, Christian, take this for your own comfort, that there is never any
   change in Jesus Christ's love to those who rest in Him. Yesterday you
   were on Tabor's top and you said, "He loves me." Today you are in the
   Valley of Humiliation, but He loves you just the same. On the hill
   Mizar and far away among the Hermons, you heard His voice which spoke
   so sweetly with the turtle-notes of love. And now, on the sea, or even
   in the sea, when all his waves and billows go over you, and deep calls
   unto deep at the noise of his waterspouts, He is just as loving to you
   as ever He was! He does not change one whit. If you lived in certain
   lands, you might look up and see on the mountain some glorious old peak
   lifting its snow-white head into the clouds. When you look up the next
   morning, can you see the mountain? No, you see nothing but fog. Is
   there no mountain? Oh, yes--

   "The mountains, when in darkness hidden, Are real as in the day."

   So is it with you. You look up today and see your Father's love and
   rejoice in it--tomorrow you may not see it so clearly, but it has not
   gone, for it abides fixed and stable--and never changes. Gourds may
   grow and wither, but God's love neither grows nor withers--it knows not
   the shadow of a change! As the Father loves Christ without change, so
   does Christ love us without change.

   Once more and then we shall entrench upon another interpretation of the
   word, "as." I think it also means that the Father loves the Son without
   any measure. I was going to say that this is an, "as," of degree, but
   it is a degree without any degree, or rather, it is a degree which
   cannot be measured! You cannot say of the Father's love to the Son that
   He loves Him up to such a point and there stops--and you cannot say of
   Jesus Christ's love to His people that He loves them so much, but does
   not love them any farther--

   "Oh, no! Christ loves His Church,

   His glory 'tis to bless

   He cannot love her more,

   He will not love her less."

   The whole heart of Christ was emptied into His people's hearts! You say
   His people's hearts could not hold it all? Very likely, but that is no
   reason why Christ did not give us all. If I cannot hold all the sea,
   yet God may give me all the sea. The Christian is filled with all the
   fullness of God. He has as much of Christ in him as he can hold. He is
   in Christ and Christ is in him. He dwells in God and God dwells in him.
   Both of these are Scriptural expressions. There is no conceivable limit
   to the love of God to us in Jesus Christ and if you need proof of it,
   go to Calvary and see, there, how He gave Himself for us--how He was
   stripped naked to His shame that He might clothe us! How He spared
   neither hands, nor feet, nor head, nor back--no, He spared not even His
   own heart--but poured out from it blood and water! "Greater love has no
   man than this, that a man lay down his life for" those whom He loves.
   There cannot be greater love than that of Christ! He went as far as
   infinity could go in love and do you know how far that is? No--

   "Imagination's utmost stretch In wonder dies away"

   at the thought of Infinite Love stretching its wings and putting itself
   forth to its highest pitch. Such is Jesus Christ's love to you!

   What was that you said the other night? That you were afraid you would
   exhaust the patience of God? A little fish said, once, he was afraid he
   would drink the sea dry, but there was never any the less water in the
   sea for all that he drank, for he was in the sea and all he drank was
   still in the sea! So all that we get from God is still in God, for, "in
   Him we live, and move and have our being." If you could give to a poor
   man in the street any quantity of money and still have just as much in
   your own pockets, no, if you could still have the same money in your
   own pockets that you had given to him, the man would say, "Well, giving
   does not impoverish you, restraining does not enrich you and, therefore
   you may well give freely." Oh, there are some of us who have such large
   appetites for Divine Love! I have sometimes felt such hungering after
   my God that I thought my soul could never be satisfied. I have thirsted
   after Him till I have felt like behemoth, who trusts that he can drink
   up Jordan at a draught! But there is enough in God to satisfy all our
   soul's needs. We sometimes sing what is strictly true--

   "All my capacious powers can wish, In You do richly meet."

   Come, then, Beloved, you have a full Savior, a precious Savior, one who
   loves you without measure, without any degree, even as the Father loves
   Him! There is much food here for those who know how to feed upon it.
   May the Holy Spirit help us to do so!

   II. Let me now ask your patient attention while I speak upon THE
   EXHORTATION OF THE TEXT--"Continue in My love."

   "What, what?" asks one, "does He love us with an everlasting love and
   yet thus admonishes us, 'Continue in My love'?" Yes, yes--the certainty
   of the thing does not at all weaken the force of the precept. This is
   God's plan, to work out His own purpose by an exhortation. Diligent
   students of God's Word must have noticed that the very things which in
   one part of Scripture are spoken of as unconditional gifts, are, in
   other parts spoken of as blessings to be anxiously desired and eagerly
   sought after. The two things are correct and consistent, one with the
   other, only some people get one of their eyes bound up so that they are
   not able to see two Truths at the same time! I am thankful if you can
   see one, but I

   should be still more glad if you could see two because I think that
   then you would be more like the perfect man in Christ Jesus who enters
   into life with both eyes! You find in one place that God is exhorting
   His people to good works as if their good works were all their own--and
   yet in another place He tells them that their good works are the gifts
   of His Spirit! In one place He tells the saints that they shall hold on
   their way and in another place He exhorts them to hold on their way.
   This is not at all inconsistent because the exhortation, by God's Grace
   applied to the heart, ministers to the fulfillment of the decree. My
   good old grandfather, I think, was quite right, when he said, "I rest
   my salvation upon the finished work of Jesus Christ as if I had never
   performed a good work in all my life. And then I endeavor to do good
   works as if everything depended upon them." This is what the Savior
   seems to say to His disciples, "Continue in My love, continue in the
   path of obedience, in the path of faith and, by your keeping of this
   exhortation shall My purpose be fulfilled, and you shall be preserved
   in My love."

   Not that this is exactly the meaning of the text. Although this may lie
   on the surface, it seems to me rather to suggest such counsel as this,
   "Continue to exhibit to others the love which I have exhibited to you."
   Some professed Christians never get into Christ's love at all in this
   sense of it. It strikes me that one of the truest signs of Grace in the
   young Christian is his love to others. As soon as ever he is, himself
   saved, he wants to have other people saved! I do not believe that
   Heaven is a place into which, if I get there, I shall be eternally
   happy at the thought of other people being shut out. On the contrary, I
   look forward to it as the place where Christ shall see of the travail
   of His soul and shall be satisfied--and it is not a little that will
   satisfy Him!

   If you ever get any comfort from the thought of others being shut out,
   you may keep your comfort to yourselves. My comfort is and I hope it
   always will be, to labor to be the means of bringing others in. Oh, to
   bring sinners to Christ! Oh, to feel the same love beating in our
   hearts which Christ has beating in His--not to the same degree, of
   course, but the same kind of love. Oh, to be baptized into that same
   river of love in which Christ was baptized, and to come out of it to
   continue in the same sort of love, so as to have the same love to
   others which Jesus Christ had to us! Do not be afraid of having too
   much love for precious souls. Do not think that you will ever go beyond
   the love of Jesus Christ in that matter. Poor cold hearts as we are,
   how shall we warm into anything like His affection?--

   "Did Christ over sinners weep, And shall our cheeks be dry?"

   Ah, there are some cheeks that were never wet with the tears for
   others, yet! And there are some hearts that never were ready to break
   for the conversion of others! "Well," says one, "every tub must stand
   on its own bottom." Yes, Sir, and if you trust to yourself, it will be
   to your everlasting ruin! If you have found honey, your first desire is
   that another should taste of its sweetness and, having found Christ,
   yourself, your first instinct will be to turn round and say to others,
   "Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world." I find
   that when I preach the Gospel without tenderness, I do not get such a
   blessing as I do when it melts my own soul. It is a good thing when the
   preacher finds his own heart breaking. Heart-broken ministers are very
   soon made heart-breaking ministers! Love to others has a kind of
   sympathetic influence and under the blessing of God the Holy Spirit,
   when men see that we care about them, they are often led to care about
   themselves. May all Christians here get fully into Christ's love and
   learn to look at sinners as Christ looked at them in all their awful
   danger--and weep over them even as Christ wept over Jerusalem!

   I think, however, that the Savior meant even a little more than this.
   Sometimes we get into Christ's love and enjoy it in our own hearts. It
   is the sweetest thing this side Heaven to know and enjoy the love of
   Jesus Christ, to have our head lying on His bosom so that we can feel
   His heart beat, and then to hear Him say, "I have loved you and given
   Myself for you." You know this, don't you? Then I know your prayer will
   be like that of the spouse, "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His
   mouth: for Your love is better than wine." I do not know how it is with
   you, but I find it rather more easy to get into this state than to stay
   there. I can get up the mountain, by God's Grace, but the difficulty is
   to stay there. Peter said, "It is good for us to be here; let us build
   three tabernacles." Yes, but it is not so easy to build one tabernacle
   upon the mountain. Christ's love-visits are so often like those of
   angels--few and far between! But yet we cannot blame our Beloved.
   Forbid it, my tongue, that you should ever say a word against Him! No,
   He would never turn me out of doors. The fault is my own--it is I who
   leave the table and refuse to stay with Him any longer. Oh, may His
   love bind us so fast to the altar that we may never stray from it, but
   may continue in His love!

   "Well," says one, "I do not think that any man could stay long in
   communion with Christ if he had as many troubles as I have." Did you
   ever read about Enoch? We are told that he lived 365 years and walked
   with God. And if Enoch walked with God so long, do you think that you
   cannot walk with Him for the few years of your short life? "Oh," you
   say, "but Enoch was differently situated from what I am." And yet it is
   written, "Enoch walked with God and begat sons and daughters," which
   seems to say that the common engagements of life and the ordinary cares
   of a family need not break off our walking with God! "But," you say,
   "he did not live in such times as these." No, he did not live in such
   good ones, for he lived before the rising of the Sun--he lived in the
   twilight, in the dim, dark ages before the great Sun of Righteousness
   had arisen with healing beneath His wings! Enoch walked with God nearly
   400 years, but there are some of us who cannot walk with Him for 400
   hours!

   Oh, may the Lord grant us more Grace, for that is where the mischief
   lies! The most of God's people, I am afraid, are in the condition of
   being just barely alive. Sometimes a man is washed up on a rock and you
   put your hand to his bosom to see if there is any heat left in him, and
   hold a mirror to his nose to see if he has any breath. You look for
   signs and evidences and, at last you say, "Yes, he is alive!" And this
   is just like a great many of you! You have to look for signs and
   evidences to know if you are alive! You are just washed up on the Rock
   and that is all. But look at many of us here--we do not need signs and
   evidences! We are alive, by God's Grace, and we know that we are! We
   can talk and laugh, and eat and drink, and engage in business. We are
   perfectly sure that we are alive because we are in good health! And so
   it is with Christians when they get to be in good sound spiritual
   health and are enabled, by Divine Grace, to do much for their Master! I
   would not be satisfied with being merely alive if I were lying
   stretched upon the bed and someone should say to me, "Well, you know
   you are alive," I would tell him that I was not satisfied merely with
   that--I wanted to be healthy and well! God grant that we may not only
   know Christ's love, but that we may get into the soul of it, into the
   marrow and fatness of it--till we live in it--and then may God's Grace
   help us to continue in it!

   But there are some poor souls here who have never got into this love at
   all, nor do they know anything about it. Perhaps, dear Friends, you
   desire to know it. Well, there is only one place where you can see it.
   The window through which you can look into God's heart is the Cross of
   Christ! If you want to read the love of God, go and look through the
   wounds of the Savior! And as you stand looking through those wounds,
   you will, if you listen, hear a voice saying--

   "Love's redeeming work is done! Come, and welcome, Sinner, come!" I
   have never heard of Jesus Christ shutting the door against a sinner.
   There is a notice that is put in some gentlemen's parks stating that
   they do not allow beggars or dogs there. But Jesus Christ puts up a
   notice that He does allow beggars! In fact, there are none but beggars
   who ever go to Him--and even those who are such beggars that you would
   not pick their clothes from a dunghill, Jesus Christ receives into His
   house, into His heart, into the bath of His blood and wraps them in the
   robe of His perfect righteousness! O poor Sinner, come and try Him, and
   He will not cast you out!

   EXPOSITION B Y C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN15.

   Verse 1. I am the true Vine, and My Father is the Husbandman. Not only
   the Mosaic Law, but the whole of creation is full of types of Christ.
   All the vines that we see in this world are only, as it were, typical,
   but Christ is the substance--the substance of Nature as well as of
   Grace. "I am the true Vine," and the real Husbandman, who watches over
   everything, who has the whole Church, yes, the whole universe, under
   His care, is the great Father. "My Father is the Husbandman."

   2. Every branch in Me that bears not fruit He takes away. It has no
   right to be there, for it is not there by a vital union--it will only
   harbor mischief if it is allowed to remain. Therefore let it be taken
   away and taken away it certainly will be by the Husbandman who makes no
   mistakes.

   2. And every branch that bears fruit, He purges it, that it may bring
   forth more fruit. So there is taking away for the fruitless branches
   and pruning for the fruit-bearing branches! Are you suffering under the
   pruning-knife just now? Accept it joyfully! How much better that the
   knife should cut off your superfluities than that it should cut you
   off! The mercy is that although God will purge and prune His vine
   branches, He will not destroy them!

   3. Now you are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you.
   Christ had so dealt with His disciples that He left them like a pruned
   branch, ready and prepared for fruitfulness.

   4. Abide in Me, and I in you. The pruning is nothing without the
   abiding in Christ. You may suffer again and again, but no good can come
   of it except you have vital, continuous, everlasting union with Christ.
   You cannot take a branch away from the vine for a little while and then
   put it back again--its life depends upon the perfect continuity of its
   union. So is it with us and Christ--the branch is in the Vine, and the
   Vine is in the branch. The very essence and sap of the Vine are in the
   branch even as the branch is part and parcel of the Vine.

   4, 5. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the
   vine; no more can you, except you abide in Me. I am the Vine, you are
   the branches. You are not the Vine--do not think that you are! And if
   God blesses you and makes you of some importance in the Church, yet do
   not dream that you are the Church, that you are the very root and stem
   of it. Ah, no, at the utmost, " you are the branches"!

   5. He that abides in Me, and I in him, the same brings forth much
   fruit. Oh, what a searching word is this! Are we bringing forth much
   fruit? I trust, dear Brothers and Sisters, that we are bringing forth
   some fruit, but, oh, what a test is this, "He that abides in Me, and I
   in him, the same brings forth much fruit." Christ expects much from
   those who have this doubly high privilege of having Him in them and of
   being, themselves, in Him!

   5, 6. For without Me you can do nothing. If a man abides not in Me, he
   is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them and
   cast them into the fire, and they are burned. And are there enough of
   them for that? It is enough to bring tears into one's eyes to think
   that there should be enough fruitless, unabiding--merely nominal
   members of Christ's Church--for men to gather to make a fire! Oh, sad,
   sad thing is this! It is the grief of the Church! It is the sorrow of
   God's ministers! It ought to call for great self-examination in our own
   hearts that mere professors--those who apostatize after having made a
   profession of religion--do not seem to have been thought by the Savior
   to be here and there one, but to be so many that "men gather them, and
   cast them into the fire, and they are burned."

   7. If you abide in Me, and My Words abide in you, you shall ask what
   you will, and it shall be done unto you. Power in prayer is dependent
   upon full enjoyment of union and communion with Christ! It is not every
   man who can ask of God what he wills and get it--it is such a man, and
   such a man only--as shall be found abiding in Christ and having
   Christ's Words abiding in him. If we do not take notice of what Christ
   says, can we expect that He will take notice of what we say? If we do
   not obey Him when He asks this and that of us, how can we reckon that
   He will give us this and that when we ask it of Him? No, this is the
   condition of power in prayer, "If you abide in Me, and My Words abide
   in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you."

   8. Herein is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall
   you be My disciples. You shall be known to be the disciples of the much
   fruit-bearing Savior! He was no moderately good Man. He was not One who
   was only a little useful in the world. Our blessed Master was perfectly
   consecrated! He abounded in every good word and work and, unless we are
   the same, how shall men think that we are His disciples?

   9. As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Matchless,
   matchless Word of God! The love of God the Father to the Son is the
   immeasurable measure of the love of Christ to His people--without
   beginning, without end, without change, without bounds! As the Father
   loved Christ, so has Christ loved us.

   9. Continue in My love. Abide in it, live in it as the fish lives in
   the stream, enjoy it--do nothing contrary to it.

   10, 11. If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love; even
   as 1 have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love. These
   things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and
   that your joy might be full. When Christ cannot rejoice in us, you may
   rest assured that we cannot rejoice in ourselves! But when His Grace so
   operates upon us that He sees that in us which gives Him contentment,
   then it is that we shall feel a blessed contentment ourselves.

   12. This is My commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved
   you. I am sure you will never love each other too much. You cannot go
   beyond this rule--"Love one another, as I have loved you."

   13. Greater love has no man than this that he lay down his life for his
   friends. What more has he that he can lay down when, having given up
   all else, he gives life, itself, for them?

   14. You are My friends if you do whatever I command you. You cannot be
   His friends if you are disobedient to His commands. An act of
   disobedience is unfriendliness. Yes, and the omission of obedience is
   unfriendliness to Christ. I wish we would always remember that every
   sin, either of omission or of commission, is an unfriendly act towards
   our best Friend.

   15. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what
   his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I
   have heard of My Father I have made known unto you. The Law made man do
   this and that, but it communicated very little of the secret counsels
   of God. But there is a holy familiarity between Christ and His people,
   a sacred confidence which Christ has manifested towards us in revealing
   the very heart of God to us and, therefore, we are put upon a very high
   standing, not as servants, but as friends. O friends of Christ, show
   yourselves friendly by your entire obedience to His gracious will!

   16. You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained, yes,
   that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should
   remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in My name, He may
   give it to you. Fruitfulness, perseverance, and power in prayer--these
   are the priceless gifts that come to us through our being one with
   Christ!

   17. These things I command you, that you love one another. As if there
   were many things in that one command. It is but one command, but it is
   so comprehensive that all the commandments are fulfilled in this one,
   "that you love one another."

   18. If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated
   you. So you need not be at all surprised if the world hates you.

   19. If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because
   you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
   therefore the world hates you. Therefore expect it, in some form or
   other, for you will be sure to meet with it! The seed of the serpent
   never will love the seed of the woman.

   20,21. Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater
   than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute
   you; if they have kept My sayings, they will keep yours, also. But all
   these things will they do unto you for My name's sake, because they
   know not Him that sent Me. "If I had not come and spoken unto them,
   they had not had sin"--as if all the rest would scarcely have been sin
   at all in comparison with that sin against the Light of God which men
   committed after Christ had spoken to them! What an amazing thing it is
   that the very Word of God which is the creation of all good should,
   through the perversity of men's will, become, also, the creation of
   evil!

   22, 23. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
   but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that hates Me, hates My
   Father, also. There is a hatred of God in all hatred of the Mediator!
   Men may say that they love God, and yet despise Christ, but it cannot
   be so. Christ is so truly God and so clear a manifestation of God that
   if men knew God, they would certainly hate Him if they hate Christ!

   24-27, If I had not done among them the works which no other man did,
   they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both Me and
   My Father. But this came to pass that the Word might be fulfilled that
   is written in their Law, They hated Me without a cause. But when the
   Comforter comes, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the
   Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the Father, He shall testify of
   Me: and you, also, shall bear witness, because you have been with Me
   from the beginning.

The Last Sermon for the Year

   (No. 2445)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 29, 1895.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   DECEMBER 26, 1869.

   "Give an account of your stewardship, for you may no longer be
   steward." Luke 16:2.

   THE first part of this text applies to us all. The second part will
   apply to each one of us before long. "Give an account of your
   stewardship," is a command that may be addressed to the ungodly. They
   are accountable to God for all that they have, or have ever had, or
   ever shall have. The Law of the Lord is not relaxed because they have
   sinned--they still remain responsible to God even though they attempt
   to cast off the yoke of the Almighty. As creatures formed by the Divine
   hand and sustained by Divine power, they are bound to serve God. And if
   they do not, and will not, His claims upon them do not cease--and to
   each of them He says, "Give an account of your stewardship."

   This text may also be applied to the children of God, to the godly--in
   a different sense, however, and after another fashion. For, first of
   all, the godly are God's children--they are accounted as standing in
   Christ. They are no longer merely God's subjects, for what they owed to
   God as sinners has all been discharged by Jesus Christ, their
   Substitute and Savior. They have, therefore, been placed on a different
   footing from other men. But having been saved by Grace and adopted into
   God's family, they have had entrusted to them talents which they are to
   use to His honor and Glory. Being the Lord's children and being saved,
   they become His servants--and as His servants they are under
   responsibility to God and they will all have to give to Him an account
   of their stewardship.

   Look at Eli. I have no doubt that he was a saved man, but God made him
   a steward over his own family as well as a Prophet to Israel, and he
   had to give an account of his stewardship. And because he had not been
   faithful in it, although he was not eternally condemned, yet he was
   made to suffer most miserably when he was told that the whole of his
   house would be swept away--and also when he heard of the deaths of his
   sons and, as the direst news of all, learned that the Ark of God was
   taken by the Philistines. God visited him in his capacity of steward,
   made him give his account, and awarded him in this life a heavy penalty
   for his unfaithfulness! And I do not doubt that many a child of God who
   has been saved at the last, yet, being found unfaithful as a steward,
   has had to suffer much, has lost much of honor and much of fellowship
   with God--and much of high advancement in the way of Grace which he
   might otherwise have obtained.

   David was another such steward. He was not a lost soul--I have no doubt
   that he is among the saved and blessed saints in Heaven--but as a
   steward he was not found faithful. You remember how grievously he
   sinned and from that moment his family was full of rebellion, his
   kingdom was full of trouble and he went with broken bones all the way
   down to his grave! Hence I may say to you, children of God, who are not
   under the Law--and I do not address you at all in a legal strain when I
   so speak to you--you also have a stewardship. Give an account of it, or
   else, perhaps, you may no longer be spared. Or, being spared, yet you
   may still have tokens of your Lord's displeasure which you may carry
   with you even to your tomb. Thank God you shall leave them there! But
   it would be more for God's Glory and for your own comfort to not have
   them at all.

   I desire, on this last Sabbath evening of another year, not so much to
   speak to you, as to get you to talk to yourselves. So, first, we will
   think together upon the reasonable demand made in our text--"Give an
   account of your stewardship." Next, we will examine some reasons why we
   should at once give an account of our stewardship. And, lastly, we will
   consider the weighty reason in the text which will come with force to
   each of us sooner or later--"You may no longer be steward."

   I. First, then, let us consider this REASONABLE DEMAND and let each one
   of us try to comply with it--"Give an account of your stewardship." You
   man of God, you Christless soul, you aged man, you young Sister, "Give
   an account of your stewardship."

   First, give an account of the stewardship of your time. How have you
   spent it? Have not many hours been allowed to run to waste, or worse
   than waste, in frivolity and sin? Have you lived as a dying man should
   live? Have you employed your hours as remembering that they are very
   few and more precious than the diamonds in an emperor's crown? What
   about your time? Has there not been much of it spent in indolence, in
   frothy talk, or that did not minister to edification? You need not
   accuse yourself for time spent in lawful recreation that may sustain
   your body and better fit it for the Lord's service. It is well that you
   should have such recreation, but how much time is utterly wasted by
   some people, neither used for the good of this world, nor of that which
   is to come, but wholly frittered away in the service of sin, self and
   Satan? Where, for instance, did some of you spend yesterday--how did
   you employ its precious hours? I will but bring that one day to your
   remembrance--was it a well-spent day? Is that hour well spent that is
   passed in the company of drunks? Do you call that day well spent that
   is given up to rioting, or that night that is defiled with wantonness?
   I charge you to answer this question! For every moment that God has
   lent to you, He will ask for an account of what you did with it. There
   is not an hour since you began to understand right from wrong for which
   you will not have to give an account to God! If there were nothing but
   time entrusted to our stewardship, here is room, indeed, for
   heart-searching and close reckoning!

   "Give an account of your stewardship," next, as to your talents. We all
   vary in our natural gifts and in our acquirements. One has the tongue
   of eloquence, another has the pen of a ready writer and a third has the
   artistic eye that discerns beauty. But, whichever of these gifts we may
   have, they belong to God and ought to be used in His service. Some have
   only such gifts as qualify them to earn their daily bread by manual
   labor--they have but little mental power--yet, for that little they
   must give an account and also for the physical strength with which God
   has blessed them. There is no person here without a talent of some sort
   or other. There is no one individual here without some form of power
   either given by nature or acquired by education. We are all endowed, in
   some degree or other, and we must, each one, give an account for that
   talent. What an account must some give who have been endowed with 10
   talents, but have wasted them all!

   What must be the account rendered by a Napoleon? What must be the
   reckoning given in by a Voltaire, with all the splendor of his
   intellect laid at the feet of Satan and desecrated to the damnation of
   mankind? Yet, while you think of these great ones of the earth, do not
   forget yourselves! What has been your special gift? You can speak well
   enough in some companies--have you ever spoken for Christ? You can
   write well, you judge that you have no mean gift in that direction--has
   your pen ever written a line that will bring your fellow men to the
   service of the Savior? What? Having 10 talents, are they all wrapped up
   in napkins, or all used for self, and none employed for God, for
   holiness, for the Truth of God, for righteousness? How sternly does the
   command come to you, "Give an account of your stewardship." Yet I am
   afraid that we cannot, any of us, give an account of our talents
   without fear and trembling!

   Next, give an account of your substance. We vary greatly as to our
   temporal circumstances, I suppose there are a few present to whom God
   has entrusted great wealth, more to whom He has given considerable
   substance and that to the most of us He has given somewhat more than is
   absolutely necessary for our actual needs. But whether it is much or
   little, we must give an account for it all! I do not know what some
   rich professors will have to say concerning that which they give to the
   cause of God. It is no tithe of their substance--it is, as it were, but
   the cheese parings and the candle ends-- and these they only give for
   the sake of appearance because it would not look respectable if they
   were altogether to withhold them! The Church's coffers would never be
   as empty as they are if it were not that some of the stewards in the
   Church are not faithful to their trust.

   It is very sad to think of some of the great men in our own country who
   have incomes which, in a single month, would furnish a competent
   support for an entire family during their whole lives! I wonder what
   sort of reckoning theirs will be when they have to give an account of
   hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds? With some of them,
   all that they can say will be, "So much lost on the racetrack, so much
   spent upon a paramour, so much paid for diamonds, so much squandered in
   this form of waste and so much in that." But for the poor and needy,
   who are perishing in our streets, the multitudes who crave even
   necessary bread--some of them have done nothing at all! There are grand
   exceptions, names that shall live as long as philanthropy is prized
   among mankind, but the exceptions are so terribly few that when the
   rich men of England are indicted at the bar of God, as they certainly
   will be, the account of their stewardship will be a truly terrible one!
   Yet what are you, and what am I, to judge thus, if we cannot say that
   we have been faithful with our little? I ask you if you have and I pray
   you to make a reckoning in your mind, now, of your stewardship of the
   gold, or the silver, or the copper with which God has entrusted you.

   We must give an account, in the next place, of our influence. Everybody
   has some kind of influence. The mother who never leaves the nursery has
   a wondrous influence over those little children of hers, though no
   neighbor feels the force of her influence and no one but her own little
   ones are affected by her faithfulness. And who knows but that she is
   pressing to her bosom, perhaps a Whitefield who will thunder out the
   Gospel through the length and breadth of the land or perhaps, on the
   other hand, an infidel, whose dreadful blasphemies shall ruin
   multitudes? There is an influence that the mother has for which she
   must give an account to God! And the father's influence--oh, Fathers,
   you cannot shake off your obligations to your children by sending them
   to school, whether to a Sunday school or a boarding school! They are
   your children and you must give an account of your stewardship
   concerning your own offspring!

   Yes, and even the nurse girl, though she seems of small note in the
   commonwealth, yet she, also, has an influence over her little charge
   which she must use for Christ. Not only he who thrills a senate with
   his oratory, but he who speaks a word from the carpenter's bench--each
   has his influence and each must use it--and give an account of it. Not
   merely the man who, by refusing to lend his millions, could prevent the
   horrors of war, but the man who with a smile might help to laugh at
   sin, or with a word of rebuke might show that he abhorred it. There is
   no one of you without influence and I ask you, now, how you have used
   it? Has it always been on the side of the Lord? "Give an account of
   your stewardship," for that influence will not always last.

   We might pass on to consider all the other things that God has
   entrusted to us, but time would fail us. So I will remind you, my dear
   Friends, with much affection, that the account which you will have to
   render and which I ask you to render now, is not an account concerning
   other people. Oh, how nice it would be if we had to do that! Would it
   not? With what gusto some would undertake the task if they had to give
   a report upon other people's characters! How easily each of us can play
   the detective upon our fellows! How ready we are to say of this man,
   "Oh, yes, he gives away a good deal of money, but it is only out of
   ostentation." Or of that woman, "Yes, she appears to be a Christian,
   but you do not know her private life." Or of that minister of the
   Gospel, "Yes, he is very zealous, but be makes a good thing out of his
   ministry." We like thus to reckon up our fellow creatures and our
   arithmetic is wonderfully accurate, at least, so we think!

   But when other people cast us up according to the same rule, the
   arithmetic seems terribly out of order and we cannot believe it to be
   right! Ah, but at the Great Judgment we shall not be asked to give an
   account for others, neither will I ask any of you, now, to be thinking
   about the conduct of others. What if others are worse than you are,
   does that make you the better, or the less guilty? What if others are
   not all they seem to be, perhaps neither are you! At any rate, their
   hypocrisy shall not make your pretense to be true! Judge yourselves,
   that you be not judged! Let each man thrust the lancet into his own
   wound and see to the affairs of his own soul--for each one must give
   account of himself to God.

   Remember, too, that you are not called upon to give an account to
   others. Alas, there are many people who seem to live only that they may
   win the esteem of their fellows! There is somebody to whom we look up
   to--if we do but have that somebody's smile, we think all is well.
   Perhaps some here are broken-hearted because that smile has vanished
   and they have been misjudged and unjustly condemned. It is a small
   matter to be judged of man's judgement--and who is he that judges
   another man's servant? To his own master, the servant shall stand or
   fall, and not to this interloping judge! My dear Friends, when the
   opinion of one leans this way, and of another the other way--when we
   see public opinion to be as restless and changing as the vane upon the
   Church steeple swinging round with every wind that blows--we may well
   bid defiance to it all and thank God that the last bar is not swayed by
   the follies of the times, and that the Great Judge will not give His
   verdict according to the whimsies of an hour, but according to the rule
   of absolute equity!

   Yet remember that if it is hard to be judged of man, it will be still
   sterner to be judged of God! If, weighed even in the balances of men,
   some of us are found wanting, how shall we bear to be put into the
   unerring scales adjusted by the Divine hand, to be judged by Him who
   cannot err--and to have our destiny fixed for all eternity--either in
   Heaven or in Hell? Remember this, my dear Hearer, and be ready to give
   an account of your stewardship--not to your fellow crea-ture--but to
   the great Creator and Judge of all!

   Remember also, dear Friends, that the account to be rendered will be
   from every man, from every man, personally, concerning himself. And
   whatever another man's account may be, it will not affect him. Some men
   will not have been any better than others of you have been. Yet if you
   perish as they perish, a numerous company will not make Hell any the
   cooler! If some men shall have been worse than others of you have been,
   it certainly will not diminish your punishment if you know that their
   doom is heavier than your own! Forget, for a while, that there are any
   other men in the world, and stand individually and separately before
   those awful eyes which are searching you through and through--for God
   will judge each of you as if there were no other men to judge--and read
   your inmost heart as if He had not another object to look upon! Give an
   account, then, of your stewardship. God grant us Grace to give, on each
   of these separate items that I have mentioned, an honest statement not
   only to our own conscience, but to Him who is the Judge of all!

   II. Now, for a few minutes, let us examine SOME REASONS WHY WE SHOULD
   AT ONCE GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF OUR STEWARDSHIP.

   It was a maxim of Pythagoras that each of his disciples should, every
   eventide, give a record of the actions of the day. I think it is well
   to do so, for we cannot too often take a retrospect of the past. But
   since, perhaps, some of you may have been lax in this duty, let me
   remind you that we have come, as it were, to the eventide of the year
   and it seems to be most suitable that before we cross into another year
   of Grace, we should, in our heart and conscience, take stock and give
   an account of our stewardship.

   Sit down a while, Pilgrim! Sit down a while. Here is the milestone
   marked with the end of another year--sit down upon it, put your hand to
   you brow and think! And lay your hand upon your heart and search and
   see what is there. This last Sabbath evening in the year is a most
   fitting time for giving this account and I ask you to use it in making
   up the account which you have to present before God. And if you feel
   unwilling to do it, I shall the more earnestly press you to do it!
   There are no persons who so dislike to look into their account books as
   those who are insolvent. Those who keep no books, when they come before
   the court, are understood to be rogues of the first water--and men who
   keep no mental memoranda of the past and bring up no recollections with
   regard to their sins, having tried to forget them all--may depend upon
   it that they are deceiving themselves! If you dare not search your
   hearts, I am afraid there is a reason for that fear and that, above all
   others, you ought to be diligent in this search.

   Permit me to remind you that if all should be wrong with you, it is
   best for you to know it. It is only the most reckless seaman who would
   rather not know whether there is a rock in the course that he is
   sailing. O Sirs, are you like the ostrich that, having covered its head
   in the sand, and shut its eyes to the hunter, thinks it is all secure?
   I pray you, seek to know the worst of your case! It seems to me that
   any honest and sane man would want to do this. There is nothing a wise
   man hates more, when he is sick, than to have a doctor attending him
   who will always, if he can, give a flattering report, but will never
   speak the truth about his patient. Let not your heart flatter you any
   longer, but say to it, "My Soul, make out an honest account! See what
   and where you are and whether you are God's servant or not, doing as
   God would have you do."

   Believer in Christ, it will be well for you to make out this account
   because you will find that it will help you to prize your Savior more.
   I never look into my own heart without first feeling shame and,
   afterwards, feeling greater love to Him who has eternally loved such a
   sinner as I am! I am sure it will drive you to your knees if you
   honestly search your own lives. There is enough in the history of a
   single week to make you prize your Redeemer more than ever if you fully
   realize the guilt of that one week and the greatness of His Grace in
   pardoning it! O Christian, if you would be driven nearer to your Lord,
   search and see, confess, repent and seek forgiveness. Go again to the
   Cross because you have again felt the burden of the sin that nailed
   your Savior there!

   And, ungodly man, I press you, also, to give an account of your
   stewardship because, perhaps, the same result may come to you. If you
   find that you cannot give so good an account as you thought you could
   when you were wrapped up in self-righteousness, perhaps you may be
   alarmed and dismayed when you see the true state of the case--and it
   may be that God the Holy Spirit will lead you to say, "I will go to
   Jesus, for I am undone without Him. I will hasten to His Cross, for I
   need the pardon that His blood has bought. I will now go with the
   language of confession on my lips and beseech Him to accept me before
   another year begins." It seems such a long time since I have talked to
   some of you. Tossing to and fro upon my bed, suffering great pain, I
   have thought that those of you to whom I have preached, now, these many
   years, will have to give an account of every address that I have
   delivered to you and of every exhortation with which I have plied you.
   I beseech you, seek to make that account at once to your God in private
   and ask Him to humble you, and to draw you sweetly to trust His dear
   Son, that you may be saved!

   I cannot bear the thought that any of you should be lost! I had hoped
   that those who have supplied my place during my illness might, perhaps,
   have been guided to shoot the arrow more directly than I can shoot it.
   One thing I know, there was not among them all, whoever they might be,
   one who more anxiously desired that you might find the Savior than I
   do! And I pray at this moment, since I shall never preach to you again
   on another Sabbath of this year, that this night may be the last one
   you will spend in sin--and that tomorrow may be a spiritual birthday to
   you, the first day in which you shall rejoice in a Savior! No, that
   this very night you may be born again and become a new creature in
   Christ Jesus!

   III. And now, lastly, let us consider THE REASON WHICH THE MASTER
   GIVES--"Give an account of your stewardship, for you may no longer be
   steward."

   This may happen in various ways. It may be that some here may live for
   years and yet no longer be stewards. A preacher may be laid aside, his
   voice gone, his mental faculties weakened--he is "no longer steward."
   One is thankful to have further opportunities of serving the Lord and
   trying to bring sinners to the Savior. O my dear Brother, work for God
   while you can! It is one of the bitterest regrets a man can know, to
   lie on his bed, to be unable to speak and to think to himself, "I wish
   I could preach that sermon over again. I did not drive that nail home
   with all the force I ought to have used! I have not been earnest enough
   in pleading with sinners! I have not wrestled, even to agony, over the
   salvation of their souls." It may be possible, my dear Brother
   Minister, that you and I may have 20 or 30 years of being laid aside
   from active service. Then let us work while we can, before the night
   comes when no man can work! Brother, let us seize the oar of the
   lifeboat and row out over the stormy sea, seeking to snatch the
   drowning ones from yonder wreck, for the time may come when our strong
   right arm shall be palsied and when we can do no more!

   Yes, and rich professors may have to give an account of their
   stewardship and no longer be stewards. There were some of that kind
   when the recent financial panic came--though they had much before the
   crash, they had nothing left afterwards so they could no longer be
   stewards of the wealth that had been taken from them! It must be a
   cause of deep regret to men in that position if they cannot give a good
   account of their stewardship because they have done but little good
   with their wealth while they had it. And think, Sirs, you to whom God
   has given great possessions, how soon He may take them from you, for
   riches abide not forever. Behold, they take to themselves wings and fly
   away! I know of no better way of clipping their wings than by giving
   generously to the cause of God and using in His service all that you
   can. It would be a subject for continual regret to you, I am sure, if
   you came down to poverty, not so much that you had descended in the
   social scale, for that you could bear if it came by mere misfortune
   through the Providence of God--but if you felt, "I did not do what I
   should have done when I had wealth"--that would be the arrow which
   would pierce you to the heart! It may be so, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   it may be so with some of you. At any rate, I feel that there are some
   of you who are poor because God will not lend His money where He knows
   that it will be locked up and not put out to good interest in His
   cause. What little you have is all hidden away, so the Lord will not
   trust you with more! He sees you are not fit to be one of His stewards.
   There are some, on the other hand, whom God has entrusted with much
   because He sees that they use it wisely in promoting the interests of
   His Kingdom.

   But, after all, to every man, whether he is rich, or whether he is in
   the office of the ministry, there may be a close of his stewardship
   before he dies. The mother has her little children swept away, one
   after another. This is the message to her, "You may no longer be
   steward." The teacher has his class scattered, or he is, himself,
   unable to go to the school. The word to him, also, is, "You may no
   longer be steward." The man who went to his work, who might have spoken
   to his fellow workman, is removed, perhaps, to another land, or he is
   placed in a position where his mouth is shut. Now he can no longer be
   steward. Use all opportunities while you have them! Catch them on the
   wing! Serve God, while you can, today! Today! Today! Today! Let each
   golden moment have its pressing service rendered unto God, lest it
   should be said to you, "You may no longer be steward."

   But we shall soon no longer be stewards in another sense. The hour must
   come for us to die. Out of our large congregation we have constant
   reminders that those who have served us as a Church and have served God
   faithfully in His Church, cannot abide with us forever. One or another,
   whom we have loved and honored, gives his account and passes to his
   rest. So will it be in turn with the pastor, with the deacons and with
   the elders. Do not put away the thought of that day, my fellow workers,
   as though you were immortal! It may come to us all of a sudden--no gray
   hairs may cover our heads--but while we are yet in the full strength of
   manly vigor, you or I may be called to give our account! What do you
   think? What do you think? Could you gather up your feet in the bed and
   look into eternity without feeling the cold sweat of fear stand upon
   your brow?

   What do you think? Could you face the great Judgment Seat and say, "I
   know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto Him against that day. I have fought a
   good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith"? Oh, God
   be praised if we are able to say that! What monuments of mercy will you
   and I be if we are able to say this at the close of our service--and to
   hear our Lord say, "Well done, good and faithful servant; enter into
   the joy of your Lord."

   My fellow member, by the fact that God is continually removing from us
   one and another, I ask you to remember that you, also, will soon
   depart. Therefore, be making up your account. Rest in Christ more
   confidently! Love God more earnestly! Serve your generation more
   intensely! Live while you live--play not at living, but live in real
   earnest--and let it never be said of you that you trod so lightly on
   the sands of time that you left no footprints there! Make your mark
   upon your age and fill your appointed place, as God shall help you,
   that when you are gathered to your fathers, you may not be forgotten,
   but the Church may remember you because in her midst there are children
   born to God through your means!

   As for the unconverted here, need I tell them that they must soon
   depart and no longer be stewards? You must go from your business, O
   Trader. You must go from your merchandise, O Merchant. You must go from
   your bench, O Artisan. You must go from your machine, O Engineer. You
   must each depart and go to that place from which no traveler returns.
   Be ready! Be ready! I will ring the alarm for some of you--perhaps my
   text is a prophecy meant for some man here--"Give an account of your
   stewardship, for you may no longer be steward." You have had children
   about you and you have taught them blasphemy and drunkenness! Or you
   have had workmen in your employ and you have laughed at their religion,
   or aided and abetted them in sin! You have had talent, but you have
   used that talent in the service of the Evil One! You have had gold, but
   you have lavished it upon wantonness!

   Now give an account of it all! Ah, Sirs, you may not heed what I say,
   but you will have to heed what will be said to you at another time! You
   will see this matter in another light when the death angel shall put
   his cold, freezing hand upon your shoulder and say to you, "Give an
   account! Give an account! Give an account of your stewardship!"

   O Savior, Son of God, put Your pierced hands on these blind souls and
   give them light that they may be able to render up their account with
   joy, and not with grief! Give them Grace to believe in Your name and
   trust in Your atoning Sacrifice, for this is the way of salvation! O
   poor Sinners, trust in Christ Jesus and Him Crucified! You cannot be
   saved by your stewardship, any of you, but unfaithful stewardship will
   ruin you! Christ Crucified is your only hope of salvation! Look unto
   Him and live! Oh, look unto Him now! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 12:13-44.

   Verses 13, 14. And one of the company said unto Him, Master, speak to
   my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. And He said unto
   him, Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you? Our Lord was a
   Judge and a Divider, but His sphere of action was spiritual--He did not
   interfere in the personal disputes of those who gathered round Him.

   15. And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
   man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he
   possesses. Christ took advantage of this man's request and made it the
   text for a sermon against covet-ousness.

   16-19. And He spoke a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
   certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he thought within
   himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to
   bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my
   barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my
   goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for
   many years, take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry. Notice how fond
   the rich man was of the little pronouns, "I," and, "my." He lived only
   for himself and was an embodiment of that covetousness which our Lord
   abhorred and denounced! What a vivid contrast there is between what the
   man said to himself and the Lord's message to him!

   20. But God said unto him, You fool, this night your soul shall be
   required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have
   provided? This may also be said to any of you--where would you be if
   the Lord said to you, "This night your soul shall be required of you"?

   21-23. So is he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich
   toward God. And He said unto His disciples, Therefore I say unto you,
   Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat; neither for the
   body, what you shall put on. The life is more than meat, and the body
   is more than raiment. Do not spend your care on the lower things--care
   most for that which is most worth caring for--more for the body than
   for raiment, more for life than for meat, and consequently, more for
   the immortal spirit than for anything besides--and more for God, even,
   than for your own soul! Let your cares be rated according to their
   objectives--to set a caring, anxious care upon the lesser things will
   be folly, indeed!

   24. Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither
   have storehouses nor barns and God feeds them: how much more are you
   better than the fowls? It seems, then, that those that are fed by God
   are much better fed than those that are fed by men! The ravens know no
   care, whatever, for God cares for them. And if we could ever bring our
   hearts into such a condition that we felt that everything to do with us
   was in God's hands, we should enter into a blessed, hallowed freedom
   from care in which we should find a sweet repose of spirit--

   "Beneath the spreading heavens, No creature but is fed. And He who
   feeds the ravens,

   Will give His children bread."

   25, 26. And which of you, by worrying, can add one cubit to his
   stature? If you, then, are not able to do that thing which is least,
   why take you thought for the rest? It would be a very small matter to
   you if you were a foot taller, or if you were a foot shorter. It is not
   that the making of yourself a cubit taller or shorter would be a small
   thing to do, but it is a small thing in its result--it is an
   inconsiderable matter whether a man is tall or short. If you, then, are
   not able, even, to reduce your stature, or to increase it, take no
   anxious thought about other things!

   27. Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not;
   and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
   like one of these. So that God cares not only for things that have
   necessities, as ravens have, but for things that have luxuries, as
   lilies have! When God does anything, He does it well. He is a grand
   Housekeeper! He does not measure out so many ounces of bread per diem,
   as if we were in a workhouse, but, "they that seek the Lord shall not
   want any good thing." "No good thing will he withhold from them that
   walk uprightly." The lilies might do as well without their golden hues.
   They might ripen their seed without the lengthened stems that lift them
   where they can be observed, but God takes more care of them, even, than
   Solomon did of himself, for, "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
   like one of these."

   Now, dear children of God, if you trust your Heavenly Father, He will
   see that you have no cause for care. If you trust Him with your souls,
   He will not give you a bare salvation, but a rich robe of righteousness
   to cover all your nakedness! When He does any work, He does it after a
   better fashion than the wisest of men could do it and, Nature herself,
   working as she does for the lilies, is only God working in another way!
   But when God, Himself, without the intervention of the laws of Nature,
   works in the Kingdom of His Grace, He does it perfectly--He does it
   gloriously!

   28. If, then, God so clothes the grass, which is today in the field,
   and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more will He clothe you, O
   you of little faith? Your life is not like that of the grass, or the
   flower of the field that fades on a summer's day. God will take care of
   you and the everlasting things shall have from Him a care greater than
   He gives to the temporal. Yet how much God really does for
   flowers--flowers that only open their cups in the morning and shut them
   in death at night! How much of skill and wisdom there is, even, about
   them! Shall there not be greater skill and wisdom employed upon you
   who, when you have once begun to bloom in the Light of God, shall go on
   blooming, flowering and shedding your perfume throughout the endless
   ages?

   29. 30. And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink,
   neither be you of doubtful mind. For all these things in the nations of
   the world seek after and your Father knows that you have need of these
   things. For you, the immortal, the twice-born, the very bodyguard of
   Christ--to live for such things as the men of the world live for is to
   degrade the peerage of Heaven--to bring those who are of the blood
   royal of the skies down to a gross pursuit! No, let your whole thought,
   heart and life be spent for something higher and better than these
   things--and leave the lower cares with your Father!

   31, 32. But rather seek you the Kingdom of God; and all these things
   shall be added unto you. Fear not little flock; for it is your Father's
   good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. When Abraham had many sons, he
   gave to each one of them a portion and sent them away. But Isaac had
   the family heritage. It is the same with you! The Lord may give to
   others more than He bestows upon you in this life, but for you He
   reserves the Kingdom! Are you not content with that, whatever else your
   Father gives you or withholds from you?

   33. Sell what you have and give alms. That is to say, do not merely
   give a little which you can readily spare, but sometimes even pinch
   yourselves to relieve the poor!

   33, 34. Provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the
   heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth
   corrupts. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be, also.
   You are sure to live for that which is the choicest object of your
   love. Whatever you think to be first, will be first--and what you love
   in your heart, you will be sure to follow in your life.

   35, 36. Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning; and you
   yourselves like unto men that wait for their master, when he will
   return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open
   unto him immediately. Many people are thinking just now of Christ's
   First Advent--but this passage bids us watch for His glorious Second
   Coming.

   37. Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, shall
   find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and
   make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. I
   never read this verse without wondering at the marvelous condescension
   of our Lord! Even in the day of His appearing in Glory, His thoughts
   will be more about His people than about Himself--"He shall gird
   himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and
   serve them."

   38. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
   watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. We cannot tell
   when He will come, but, "Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord,
   when He comes, shall find watching."

   39-44. And this know, that if the good man of the house had known what
   hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered
   his house to be broke into. Be you, therefore, ready also: for the Son
   of Man comes at an hour when you think not. Then Peter said unto Him,
   Lord, speak You this parable unto us, or even to all? And the Lord
   said, Who, then, is that faithful and wise steward, whom his master
   shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat
   in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his master, when he comes,
   shall find so doing. Of a truth I say onto you, that he will make him
   ruler over all that he has. Wonderful words! We cannot at present tell
   all that they mean, but, by God's Grace, may they be fulfilled to us
   when our Lord comes to take us to Himself!
