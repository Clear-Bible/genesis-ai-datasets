INTRODUCTION

   IN the first volume of this work Professor Wernle deals with the rise
   of the Christian religion as it manifests itself in the personality and
   teaching of Jesus and His immediate followers. This is the creative
   period, the period of great men. In the second volume we follow the
   fortunes of the new faith when the great men are succeeded by a great
   ecclesiastical organization. Henceforth it is within the rules and
   forms imposed upon it by this mighty organization that the Gospel has
   to find a footing and make its way among the populations of the ancient
   world. The free creative period, the period of the unfettered spirit,
   is succeeded by an age of anonymity in which institutions, dogmas and
   sacraments rise up and fill the place originally occupied by the great
   personalities of the first Christian generation. Many ecclesiastical
   historians have regarded the elaborate process which took place in the
   second century of incorporating the Gospel into a hard and fast group
   of institutions, forms and ceremonies, as a time of decadence, and no
   doubt it stands immeasurably below the classic and creative age of
   primitive Christianity. But it must be remembered that the Christian
   institutions of sub-apostolic times were the direct and inevitable
   outcome of the conditions in which the new religion was placed; it was
   only in the garment of an ecclesiastical organization that the Gospel
   could retain its essential character and fight its battle with the
   opposing forces of Jewish and Pagan thought.

   In the opening chapters of this volume Professor Wernle shows us how
   the successors of the primitive preachers of Christianity fell into
   disrepute among the Christian communities, and how these communities
   organized themselves into a Church resting on the basis of episcopacy.
   It is interesting to watch the rise of the bishop from a humble and
   subordinate place in the community to a position of dignity and power
   which ultimately makes him the centre of the new ecclesiastical system.
   In spite of having to face the somewhat formidable rivalry of ascetics,
   saints and martyrs, the pressure of circumstances within the community
   and outside of it as well lifted the bishops into the highest position
   in the Church, and determined the character of ecclesiastical
   institutions for centuries to come. After organizing itself from
   within, the Church was confronted from without by the three great
   forces of Judaism, Hellenism, and Gnosticism. Ecclesiastical theology
   was to a large extent the outcome of the struggle of the Church with
   these rival forms of belief and life; and although the Church outwardly
   succeeded in overcoming its non-Christian rivals, it had to pay the
   price of victory by admitting many alien elements into the Christian
   creed. Judaism was conquered, but Jewish ecclesiasticism, Jewish
   ethics, Jewish apologetics, and Jewish apocalyptic fancies secured a
   home within the Church. Hellenism was conquered, but Greek religion
   furnished Christianity with some of its doctrines and mysteries, and
   Greek philosophy widened its horizon and supplied it with an apologetic
   and a conception of the world based on the ideas of reason and law.
   Gnosticism was crushed, but the Gnostics succeeded in introducing a
   scholastic conception of Christianity into the Church, in which the
   Christian faith was confounded with intellectual orthodoxy. All these
   points are brought out and illustrated by Dr Wernle in his excellent
   chapters on the rise of Ecclesiastical Theology. But the Christian
   religion at heart is not a code of beliefs nor a mere ecclesiastical
   organization; it is fundamentally a hope, a redemption, a life. After
   discussing the Theology of the New Testament in a chapter which does
   not appear in the first German edition, Professor Wernle appropriately
   closes his account of the Beginnings of Christianity with a lucid
   review of Christian piety in sub-apostolic times. We gather from this
   account that notwithstanding the changes which the Christian faith had
   to undergo in the second century, the Gospel still remained a power in
   the individual life. But persecution produced hypocrites and apostates
   as well as martyrs. The rise of orthodoxy narrowed the original range
   of Christian love, and tended to confine it within the limits of the
   Church; but the Christian congregations, in spite of manifest defects,
   were superior to their heathen surroundings, and many individuals
   amongst them were earnestly endeavouring to realize the Christian ideal
   in their daily lives.

AUTHOR'S NOTE

   THE author considers it advisable to direct attention to two points in
   which a slight difference exists between the first and second volumes.
   In the first volume the origin of the conception of the sacraments is
   derived from St Paul (p. 273), and not from the earliest Christian
   community; whereas vol. ii. presupposes the existence of the sacraments
   in the earliest Church, and even suggests that they are anterior to
   Christianity itself (vol. ii. p. 128). On this point the author has
   accepted the arguments advanced by Bousset and Heitm√ºller.

   The first volume did not clearly settle the question whether, according
   to St Paul, all Christians attained salvation, or only a part of them
   (vol. i. p. 219 seq., and p. 281), whereas the second volume
   presupposes that St Paul considered all the members of his congregation
   as the elect of God's mercy (vol. ii. p. 91). Here the author's doubts
   have been removed by studies of his own in later ecclesiastical history
   which has presented analogous cases. For the work as a whole these
   differences are of little importance, but the author begs his English
   readers to excuse the want of complete agreement between the two
   volumes.

CHAPTER I.

  THE DECAY OF THE APOSTLES AND PROPHETS.

   IN the earliest age of Christianity the external constitution is of
   altogether secondary importance compared with the living personalities.
   The course of events was shaped by men whose names were well-known and
   who were animated by a profound sense of their call. It is true that
   the congregations were gradually formed into an organization, but there
   was as yet nothing permanent about it: it was entirely under the
   influence of the Spirit. As to the personality of St Paul, the apostle
   by revelation, it eluded all attempts at inclusion under any
   organization whatever.

   The great men died out, the stream of inspiration ran dry. Hence the
   change. We have here one of those facts which, while they explain
   everything else, do not themselves admit of explanation. There is a
   great gap between the apostles and the bishops and teachers of the
   commencement of the second century. The picture of the aged apostle St
   John in Asia Minor is altogether fanciful, however much the later
   tradition knows about it. It is only with Ignatius, Polycarp, and
   Justin Martyr that we emerge again from the tunnel into the daylight.
   In between lies the great anonymous period.

   The organization of the itinerant preachers, men driven by the Spirit,
   did, it is true, resist the tendency to decay for a considerable time.
   But it is the rule in history, that institutions outlive the spirit
   that created them. After a long struggle it finally succumbed to the
   episcopal organization and to the catholic theology. The Catholic
   Church came into being in the course of this struggle. There is
   something tragic about it, as the vanquished, while representing the
   higher idea, are inferior to the victors in moral strength. The former
   are the prophets, the latter the priests and theologians.

   The first missionary period had come to an end even before the close of
   the first century. We hear no more of the sending forth of new
   missionaries, of collections for them, of the founding of new
   congregations. Not that we are to infer from this that Christianity no
   longer spreads as rapidly as before. On the contrary, the extension of
   Christianity has only just begun, and there is a marked increase every
   decade. But there is all the difference in the world between the two
   methods. In the one case the Christian merchant or soldier carries the
   gospel message with him on his business journey, on his day's march; in
   the other, single congregations send out regularly appointed
   missionaries who evangelize in accordance with a carefully organized
   plan. The most important documents of this age, the Acts, the Pastoral
   epistles, the Fourth Gospel, show no missionary interest in their own
   time. The author of the Acts recounts the history of the first missions
   as something entirely past. He nowhere takes up the thread to continue
   his story and tell us something of the missions of his own day. The end
   of every incident is the appointment of presbyters, not the sending
   forth of new missionaries. Timothy is, it is true, called an evangelist
   in the Pastoral epistles, but his work consists entirely in the
   establishment of the congregations and the controversy with the
   heretical teachers. The founding of new congregations lies entirely
   beyond the horizon of the author of these letters. One might at first
   sight appear to have rather more justification in appealing to certain
   passages in the Fourth Gospel in support of the view that missionary
   work still continued. All that the author really says, however, is that
   the mission to the Samaritans and that to the Gentiles can both be
   traced back to Jesus Himself, and in so doing he offers an explanatory
   comment on the story in the Acts. His interest centres in the struggle
   with Judaism, but even so he cannot really be said to have the
   conversion of these Jews at heart, otherwise he would not have
   described the attitude of Jesus as so absolutely opposed to them, nor
   the Jews themselves as such perverse children of the devil. But the
   alterations introduced into the parable of the Good Shepherd are in
   themselves sufficiently significant for the changed position of
   affairs. The Shepherd is no longer to go out to seek and to save the
   lost. His duty now, the duty of His successors, is simply to protect
   the fold from attacks.

   The new task which is now laid upon the apostles and prophets is no
   longer the foundation of new congregations, but the welding together of
   the old ones. They continue to wander about preaching, but it is to
   fully organized Christian congregations. Decay sets in quite of itself,
   owing to the cessation of their real work as missionaries, with all the
   sacrifices and the privation which it involved. Want of discipline,
   mendicancy, trickery and charlatanism are increasingly prevalent
   amongst the itinerant preachers. They make use of their divine
   authority--he that receiveth you, receiveth God--to the damage of the
   congregations. These are the false prophets that come in sheep's
   clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. They boast of
   prophesying and casting out devils and work miracles in Jesus' name,
   and yet they are steeped in wickedness. They do not spare the flock of
   Christ, but, shameless beggars that they are, get what they can--silver
   and gold and raiment. Or they creep into houses and captivate women
   laden with sin and slaves to all kinds of passions. These few passages,
   taken from the first and third evangelist, and the Pastoral epistles,
   are well illustrated by the Didache and the eleventh commandment of
   Hermas. There the apostle is described as staying as long as possible
   in each congregation so as to take his ease in a comfortable berth, and
   then at his departure he gets himself furnished with plenty of
   provisions for the journey, and if he can manage it, money as well. Or
   the prophet appears on the scene, falls into an ecstasy, orders a meal
   and consumes it cheerfully; or else he exclaims in rapt tones, "Give me
   money," and puts it into his pocket with a very solemn face. The people
   flock to the Christian prophet as though to a soothsayer. He is quick
   at understanding their questions and their wishes, and cuts his cloth
   after their measure. Of course he does nothing gratis. Thereupon he
   makes his public appearance, as impudent as ever, claims the seat of
   honour, insists upon being present at every festival and every meal;
   the only thing that he avoids is the public service of the Church. In
   the end there was no difference whatever between these Christian
   apostles and prophets and the Greek sophists and Oriental magicians.
   All the more urgent was the protection needed by the congregations
   against these impudent men of God. There must be some means of testing
   these gentry. "By their fruits ye shall know them." "Not everyone who
   speaks in ecstasy is a prophet, but only he who at the same time
   walketh in the way of the Lord." "By his deeds shall the true prophet
   be distinguished from the false." "Test the man who claims to have the
   Spirit of God by his life." The working of miracles soon falls into
   discredit. Doubt in the Holy Ghost, once the greatest of sins, now
   becomes a duty. In this crisis the apostolic order must have come to an
   end, whilst the prophets just managed to continue to exist. Discipline
   was restored first of all in the West.

   A new and very serious danger arose through the appearance of the
   Gnostic heresy among the itinerant preachers themselves. It began quite
   gradually and anonymously--the influence of certain foreign religions
   combined with tendencies originating in the Christian feeling of
   freedom. A strange and characteristic phraseology came into use: words
   such as "the higher knowledge," "superior wisdom," "completion of the
   teaching of the apostles," "progress and liberty." It was the itinerant
   preachers who now carried the new phraseology from place to place just
   as before they had disseminated the Gospel of Jesus. They are best
   known to us in Asia Minor. There was a prophetess at Thyatira--she is
   called Jezebel in the language of the Apocalypse--who recommended
   fornication and the eating of meats offered to idols as a means of
   arriving at the knowledge of the depths of Satan; while others, again,
   went about preaching asceticism, forbidding men to marry or to partake
   of certain articles of food, and appealing to the Old Testament as
   their authority, which they explained according to their own liking.
   Soon, too, dogmatic heresies took root and began to grow. Cerinthus
   appeared in Asia teaching that the creator of the world, the demiurge,
   was not the highest God and Saviour, but quite a subordinate being; and
   that the divine Christ who descended at baptism and returned to heaven
   before His death, must be sharply distinguished from the human Jesus.
   In the time of the Johannine letters we find people with a similar
   Christology travelling up and down the country as missionaries, and
   claiming to be inspired by the Spirit. Later on, when Ignatius visits
   the churches in Asia Minor, he is perpetually coming across traces of
   these sowers of tares. Appealing to their inspiration by the Spirit and
   under the pretext of a superior wisdom, they propagate Judaistic and
   Docetic heresies. Nor was the state of affairs very much better in
   other districts, especially in Egypt and Syria, where the Epistle of St
   Jude and the Didache note the presence of Gnostic heretics.

   It was in consequence of this receptivity of the prophets for every
   kind of heretical spirit that new measures were taken to protect the
   congregations, and tests were set up of a dogmatic and ethical
   character. "Righteousness," "Faith and Love," "Jesus Christ come in the
   flesh"--such were some of the shibboleths by which all teachers were to
   be judged. Not everything that claims to be of the Spirit is of divine
   origin; it may also be due to the suggestion of demons, of Antichrist.
   "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they
   are of God." The only prophecy tolerated is that which conforms to the
   creed of the Church. We meet with such ecclesiastical prophets
   throughout the whole of the second century down to the Montanist
   controversy; nor can it be denied that they did the Church good service
   in the struggle against the Gnostics. But the spirit of the first age
   that set up and rejected free rules and canons had long ceased to find
   utterance in them.

   Besides the two enemies, however, which have been already mentioned,
   there was yet a third, a formidable rival, which was bound finally to
   make an end of this order of itinerant preachers, and that was the
   constitution of the single congregations. The Church was now composed
   of a number of separate churches permanently established. No single
   prophet could supervise all these churches any longer, or influence
   them by his spirit. Each congregation had its own officers, and they
   now began to protest against the outside interference of apostles in
   matters which they neither knew nor understood. Their protests were
   well founded. Autonomy was essential for the future development of the
   congregations in these troubled times of State persecution and Gnostic
   confusion, and had to be substituted for the former system of
   government from outside. In the third Epistle of St John we have a
   touching piece of evidence for the clash of the old with the new system
   of organization--touching, because the writer himself belongs to the
   old time, and is distressed as he contemplates the process of change.
   He has sent his messenger round to inquire as to the faith and love of
   the congregations. But a certain Diotrephes who wants to be first among
   them, declines to receive them, and expels those who wish to do so from
   the Church. But was this wicked Diotrephes so very much in the wrong,
   if he found that the messenger had no business at all in his
   congregation? The author of the Pastoral epistles and Ignatius were
   exactly of his opinion. The apostles and prophets come and stir up
   strife in the Church unnecessarily, they alienate the congregations
   from their bishop, they hold conventicles and start rival services.
   Elsewhere, in the Didache, the itinerant preachers and the officers of
   the congregations are still to be found working amicably together. The
   prophets and teachers are still honoured far more highly than the
   bishops and deacons: the former are looked upon as inspired, the latter
   are just elected officials. And yet the author of this legal document
   is a warm advocate of the officials--"despise them not, for they are
   deserving of your respect together with the prophets and teachers";
   while he sets up a perfect barricade of precautionary measures against
   the inspired evangelists. There is no doubt, therefore, which of the
   two will gain the upper hand in the future.

   At Rome, again, we find altogether different conditions prevailing. The
   prophets had evidently never enjoyed the same esteem there as in the
   East, for even the end of the first century witnessed the episcopal
   organization with the principle of apostolic succession fully matured
   in all essentials. Here, too, there were prophets (Hermas), but if they
   did not prove obedient to the constitution, they were set aside as
   false prophets, relegated to obscurity, and so entirely degenerated.
   From the very first, order here prevailed over anarchy.

   The diminished importance of the itinerant preachers and the decay of
   this institution brought about an important change in ecclesiastical
   terminology, at least in so far as the apostles are concerned. The
   title of Apostle' was reserved for the Twelve and St Paul; the other
   missionaries are no longer called apostles but evangelists. This
   altered use of words was accelerated by the historical fact that Paul
   was the only apostle for his congregations; he never calls his
   fellow-missionaries apostles. Perhaps he had them in view when, in the
   letter to the Ephesians, he introduces the term evangelist.' The new
   theory, however, that it was only in the first age, the age when the
   foundations were laid, that apostles existed, and that therefore the
   apostolic age is to be distinguished from all later ages by the sole
   possession of this charisma, is entirely destitute of historical
   foundation, and is in contradiction with St Paul himself.

   The passing away of the apostles and prophets was no event of merely
   secondary importance in the history of Christianity. It signified the
   end of inspiration. God ceased to speak directly through men. One main
   element in early Christianity--the Faith in a God that speaks and works
   in the present--had begun to decay.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II.

  THE DEVELOPMENT OF EPISCOPACY.

   THE question now arises, Who stepped into the place left vacant by the
   inspired leaders of the first age?

   It was the presiding officials of the single congregations, whose
   duties were originally confined to the care of public worship, Priests
   and Levites according to Jewish conceptions. In the very earliest age
   of all, they were persons who came forward voluntarily, either men of
   substance who placed a room at the disposal of the community for the
   meetings and there supervised the discipline, or men of trust, in whose
   hands the offerings for the poor were placed for distribution. In his
   earlier letters St Paul calls them presidents' or workers.' In the
   letter to the Philippians, written not long before the apostle's death,
   they appear for the first time in the two divisions of overseers
   (bishops) and ministers (deacons). The apostolic age knows nothing as
   yet of an election and institution of these officials; it is only in
   the succeeding age that this becomes the rule. Presbyterial colleges
   appointed by election, frequently at the suggestion of apostles and
   prophets who happen to be present, are the constant characteristic of
   the sub-apostolic age. Proofs for the existence of these colleges,
   which are as yet without any monarchical form of government, are to be
   found in almost all the writings of this period which have come down to
   us: the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Pastoral
   letters, 1st Peter, James, Clement, Polycarp, the Didache, Hermas. The
   titles which are used in these writings to designate the presidents of
   the colleges are very various. They appear now as overseers' (bishops),
   now as elders' (presbyters), now as shepherds,' and again as leaders,'
   nor can any appreciable difference be discovered in the use of these
   titles. The overseers' and elders' especially evidently designate the
   same persons; and a second conclusion which is equally certain is that
   the ministers' (deacons) are subordinate helpers of the overseers.

   The work of the colleges was of a wide and all-embracing nature in the
   conduct of the communities affairs generally. That is expressed by the
   words leaders,' shepherds,' presidents.' More especially, however,
   their activity may be considered under the three chief heads of the
   conduct of religious worship, the preservation of public order, the
   dispensation of social charities. The enumeration of the qualities
   required of the members of the colleges shows us better than anything
   else that their energies were concentrated in this direction.
   Sincerity, honesty, mildness, gentleness, are the chief characteristics
   that were looked for in them. Teaching and preaching formed at first
   the least part of a priest's work. The teachers and the prophets were
   there for that purpose, and everyone was free to expound the word. But
   the struggle with Gnosticism brought about an entire change. In the
   Pastoral letters, the maintenance of sound doctrine--i.e., of the
   apostolic tradition--against heresy comes to be the bishop's chief
   function. That is why it is so important that the bishop should be apt
   to teach, and that is why the teaching presbyters are to receive a
   double reward. In these passages one can still plainly trace the fact
   that teaching did not originally enter into a bishop's activities.
   Ignatius goes a good deal further. He would have nothing done without
   the bishop: every ecclesiastical act is to be submitted to him. Thus
   the scope of the bishop's office is gradually enlarged. Originally he
   is simply the president of a presbyterial council, finally he takes
   over all the functions of a prophet and an apostle, though, to be sure,
   only with the application of the principles of the division of labour
   and of strict subordination.

   The increased dignity of these officials keeps pace with the
   development of their functions. Originally it was only the apostles and
   prophets that counted as the messengers of God's word and
   representatives of God and of Christ for the Church, whilst the bishops
   were the officials of the single congregations without any higher
   honour. Their exaltation to their new position of dignity was brought
   about in a threefold manner.

   1. By the theory of apostolic succession. The way is paved for this
   theory by the Acts of the Apostles, which emphasizes the apostolic
   institution of the presbyters and makes Paul speak to the presbyters at
   Miletus as though to his successors. Then it is regularly formulated by
   Clement of Rome (ch. 42-44). At the bottom of the theory lies the fact
   that the office of president goes back to the apostolic age; but it is
   just in the case of Rome that the principle does not apply, for the
   Roman Church was not an apostolic foundation. Clement is the first to
   draw up the line "God, Christ, the apostles, the elders," which gives
   the elders a share in the divine dignity by means of tradition. Similar
   thoughts of a succession are to be found in the Pastoral letters (St
   Paul's "gift"). At bottom this theory of apostolic succession forms a
   counterpart to that of the Jewish Rabbis; like this theory, it is of a
   legal nature and therefore especially comprehensible to the Romans.

   2. By the theory of a special gift of the Spirit attached to the
   office. We find it first of all in the Pastoral epistles side by side
   with that of the apostolic succession. The two, in fact, run into each
   other as they did in the case of the Rabbis. The gift of the Spirit is
   made to depend upon the right succession. Amongst the Christians this
   theory was bound to strengthen the hands of the defence against the
   heretics and the prophets. For itinerant preachers and Gnostics alike
   appealed to "the Spirit." In order to check their extravagances it was
   now maintained that the Spirit was only to be found amongst the Church
   officials, not amongst the Gnostics, but--and this is the evil
   consequence of the theory--no longer amongst the congregation either.
   "I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is
   in thee through the laying on of my hands. For God gave us not a spirit
   of fearfulness but of power, love, and discipline . . . . the good
   deposit' guard through the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us."

   The we' who have the Spirit are the officials of the Church alone. An
   Ignatius, it is true, felt himself to be inspired, for he believed
   himself entitled to boast of genuine visions; but then he tries to make
   his theory apply to all bishops, even to those who never had any
   inspiration of this kind. The only way in which the theory can gain the
   victory over enthusiasm and prophecy is by falsely proclaiming every
   bishop to be a prophet.

   3. By the theory of the Old Testament priesthood. The first trace of it
   is to be found in the first Epistle of St Clement (ch. 40), where
   reference is made to the typical nature of the Israelite priesthood;
   but it may just as well have arisen in Egypt or Syria amongst the
   readers of the Didache--in fact, wherever the Old Testament was counted
   a sacred book of the law. There in the Old Testament they read of a
   clear and sharp distinction between clergy and laity--this is noticed
   even as early as Clement!--and of a hierarchy with different degrees of
   dignity. The type was endowed with creative power. The Didache, as is
   well-known, furnishes other evidence of the great and commanding
   influence which the Old Testament exercised upon the congregations.

   All three theories possessed the further advantage of being capable of
   combination. This is what actually occurred a little later. The bishops
   became the successors of the apostles, prophets, and priests. By the
   end of the first century the foundation of the whole system had been
   laid.

   The first external consequence of the new dignity was that the bishops
   came to be paid. The author of the Acts still protests against the
   innovation: instead of copying those grievous wolves, the itinerant
   preachers, the bishops should learn of Paul to earn their livelihood by
   the labour of their own hands. In the province in which the Didache was
   written the prophets and teachers were paid rich contributions in kind;
   if no prophet was present, then it was the poor and not the bishops who
   benefited thereby. Such was the original practice. The author of the
   Pastoral epistles has quite a different opinion on this point:--"The
   husbandman that laboureth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
   Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all
   things." All this is as yet very mysterious and cautious. The later
   letter is less enigmatic: "Let the elders that rule well [not all
   therefore indiscriminately] be counted worthy of double honour [i.e.,
   be paid], especially those who labour in the word and in teaching [for
   they have less time to devote to their own business]. For the Scripture
   saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn,' and
   the labourer is worthy of his hire.'" Evidently the payment of bishops
   is still an innovation which is not to be risked without due
   limitations, and has to be supported by passages from Scripture. It
   helped to increase the professional feeling of the clergy.

   Our earliest authority for the monarchical episcopate and the threefold
   ministry--bishops, presbyters, and deacons--is Ignatius (110-120 A.D.),
   and that only for Antioch in Syria and for Asia Minor. In other
   places--e.g., in Rome or Philippi--it must have arisen a little later.
   But no account of its origin has reached us. It is altogether
   improbable that it was preceded by struggles within the presbyteral
   council. Episcopacy prevailed, and that after a peaceful fashion,
   because it found itself the best weapon against the itinerant preachers
   and the best centre of ecclesiastical unity. Perhaps the process of
   development was simply this, that the earlier office of president came
   to be held for life instead of, as before, in succession temporarily.

   But what reception was accorded the new constitution by the
   congregations? As far as they were ecclesiastically minded, they viewed
   it with favour. It was a time of struggle and of persecution--the
   Church needed strong and skilful leaders. There was, however, naturally
   some diversity of opinion, and many old and young Christians
   sympathized with the itinerant preachers. Evidence of this may be found
   in the Third Epistle of St John. But the more perfect organization won
   the day.

   Thus, then, the Church had received its new leaders. Those who a short
   while previously had been merely occupied with the public services, now
   found themselves suddenly at the head of the whole spiritual life.
   Religious gifts were less looked for in these men than energy and a
   practical turn of mind. The more serious Christians, however, made it a
   matter of anxious concern that the bishop should be of an exemplary
   moral life. The man who did more than all others to increase their
   authority--the author of the Pastoral epistles--took the utmost pains
   at the same time to further the improvement of their moral condition.
   He found them in a state of degradation and sluggish degeneracy. He
   instigated the first reform of the clergy. He demanded that the bishop
   should be apt to teach. This aptitude, however, was not to be obtained
   compulsorily, and yet the intellectual development of the congregation
   depended upon it.

   The Formation of the Office of Teacher in the Catholic Church.

   Of the three most important personalities of the apostolic age, the
   apostle, the prophet and the teacher, the last-named alone subsists in
   sub-apostolic times, and that not without having traversed a serious
   crisis. There were some critical moments when the Christian teacher,
   too, threatened to degenerate into the talkative and controversial
   Sophist. Hence the warning in the Epistle of St James: "I do not want
   many of you, my brothers, to become teachers, knowing as you do that we
   who teach shall be judged by a more severe standard than others." The
   author of the Pastoral epistles would prefer to merge the office of
   teacher entirely in that of bishop, and looks with suspicion upon all
   freelances. His demands, however, were pitched too high. The bishops
   could guarantee the true doctrine of others, but they could never take
   up the calling of teachers themselves; they had far too much practical
   work in hand for that. The problem was solved by placing the teachers
   henceforward under episcopal control. They had to subscribe to the
   creed, but otherwise they had complete liberty of teaching, i.e., as
   far as the ecclesiastical authorities were concerned. We only meet with
   such teachers, it is true, about the middle of the second century:
   Aristides at Athens, Justin at Ephesus and Rome, Tatian at Rome and in
   Syria. The two latter are great travellers, recalling the teachers
   earlier mode of life, the old itinerancy. They defended the Christian
   faith against heathen philosophers, Jewish Rabbis, and Christian
   Gnostics. For the Gnostics, too, had their celebrated teachers, and
   they were earlier in the field than their orthodox opponents:
   Basilides, Valentinus, Kerdon, Marcion, all of whom likewise travelled
   about from place to place. Of the catholic teachers in Justin's time,
   we know that they taught gratuitously (Justin himself had taken an
   unceremonious leave of the peripatetic philosopher because he had
   demanded money for his lessons). They had therefore to look to the
   congregations for their means of subsistence. This is confirmed by the
   Didache.

   The great anonymous period of the teacher's office extends from the age
   of Apollos to that of Justin. Anonymity is really its characteristic
   feature; the names of Catholic and Gnostic teachers alike have
   completely vanished. The literature, however, that has come down to us
   from the anonymous teachers of the Church is of considerable extent. It
   includes, amongst other writings, the Catholic Epistles, the Acts of
   the Apostles, the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Gospels (except that of
   Mark), the Pastoral epistles, Barnabas, the Didache. Of the
   ecclesiastical authors, besides the bishops, we are only acquainted
   with an evangelist, Mark, one prophet, Hermas, and Aristion, to whom
   the spurious conclusion of St. Mark's Gospel may possibly be ascribed.

   There are also very many pseudonymous writings amongst the products of
   the literary activity of the catholic teachers. The Gospels, the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, and the letter known as that of St Barnabas,
   are the only works which begin without any name whatever. The whole of
   the remaining literature claims to be apostolic. And this is one of the
   clearest proofs that we have reached an age of decline. These teachers
   feel their inferiority. Their names carry no weight, they possess no
   authority. It is only by prefixing the names of the apostles to their
   letters (which, moreover, are letters in name only, mere literary
   fabrications) that they gain any hearing. A parallel to this
   ecclesiastical usurpation of apostolic authority is to be found in the
   constant appeal to secret apostolic tradition by the Gnostics.

   Thus the fathers of the later catholic office of teachers are anonymous
   persons who acquired a standing, not by their own personal influence,
   but only by the assumption of spurious titles--a kind of necromancy. It
   was they who laid the foundations of the later catholic theology. They
   were the spiritual leaders of the Church in the greatest crisis which
   the Church ever traversed, and the Church's safe emergence from that
   crisis is to be ascribed to them and to the bishops.

CHAPTER III.

  THE ORDER OF THE SAINTS.

   As long as there were apostles and prophets they were the homines
   religiosi, the representatives of ecstasy and exaltation, and of all
   that was extraordinary. They were the incarnation of the enthusiastic
   impulse, of that excess of zeal, love and energy which could find no
   room in the everyday life. This impulse had to discover a new outlet
   when the order of the apostles and of the prophets succumbed to the
   altered circumstances of the times. The Christian life was too
   abnormal, too vehement, too volcanic to find full satisfaction in the
   office of bishop or of teacher, and in the ordinary layman's piety.
   There must be saints to set a goal to the longing of the deepest
   natures, to whom the masses could look up and venerate as heroes. They
   are the successors of the apostles and the prophets in the abnormal
   manner of their lives, though not in their historical calling. They do
   not represent anything distinctively Christian; they belong rather to
   the universal history of religion than to the history of the Gospel.

   Who are the saints of the sub-apostolic age? First of all come the
   martyrs. It was a time of struggle, and they died a hero's death for
   their Redeemer. Even in the Apocalypse they occupy the first rank. It
   is of them that the writer is thinking when he praises the great
   multitude who have come out of the great tribulation, who have
   conquered in the strength of the Lamb: they are the first to rise from
   the dead and to live and reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom.
   One is mentioned by name, the martyr of Pergamos, Antipas the faithful
   witness. The Apocalypse itself is intended as an invitation to
   martyrdom: "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth"
   [i.e., as martyrs]; "yea, saith the spirit, they shall rest from their
   labours; for their works follow with them."

   Other writings celebrate the martyrs of past ages as saints, so the
   Epistle to the Hebrews. The catalogue of the men of faith--the cloud of
   witnesses--is closed with the martyrs. The author enumerates every
   variety of death and terror. "Some were crucified, others had trial of
   mockings and scourgings; yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment; they
   were stoned, tortured, sawn asunder; they were slain with the sword:
   they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute,
   afflicted, evil-intreated, of whom the world was not worthy." That
   applies to the martyrs of the Jewish Church, but it shows how Christian
   enthusiasm was kindled by such fancies. The Acts of the Apostles
   celebrates the apostles as martyrs. Nothing but his martyrdom is
   related of James, and not much more of Stephen. St Peter and St Paul
   are heroes of suffering. But the fatal termination is by no means the
   most important part of a martyrdom. The most famous cases are those
   when the hero is rescued from the greatest danger by a divine miracle:
   Peter in prison, Paul at Lystra and at Philippi. The first Epistle of
   St Clement refers to the two apostles St Peter and St Paul, who died
   the martyr's death. "To whom were added a great number of the elect,
   who, suffering many torments and much dishonour through jealous enmity,
   gave us thereby a most excellent example." The "Shepherd" of Hermas,
   written in a time of persecution, is especially instructive. In his
   vision the prophet is about to seat himself on the right hand of the
   woman that appears to him, but she refuses to give him this seat of
   honour; it belongs to the martyrs alone who have endured scourgings and
   imprisonment, great plagues, crucifixion and wild beasts for the sake
   of the Name. It is true, however, that the same third vision afterwards
   mentions only the martyrs in the second place, namely, after the
   apostles, bishops, teachers and deacons. The martyr is accordingly to
   rank above the prophets but below the bishops, which points to the
   first beginnings of disputes as to precedence. Martyrdom is already
   reckoned as so high a merit, quite in itself and apart from the rest of
   the Christian life, that Hermas feels himself compelled to enter the
   lists against this exaggerated estimate of its value. To certain
   martyrs or confessors he declares: "Had ye not suffered for the name of
   the Lord, ye had been as dead in the sight of God because of your
   sins." At the same time he declares that martyrdom procures forgiveness
   of sins for all men. Such were the views of the Church at Rome. The
   martyrdom of Polycarp and the Ignatian letters show us how far more
   highly martyrdom was esteemed in the East than the episcopal office,
   for both Polycarp and Ignatius were bishops. So we read in the
   martyrdom of Polycarp. "We pray to Christ as to the Son of God, but we
   love the martyrs as the disciples and followers of the Lord." Ignatius,
   who has so lofty a consciousness of his episcopal office, declares that
   it is only now, in martyrdom, that he begins to be a true disciple of
   Jesus. It is only the martyr who in the strict sense of the word
   follows the steps of Jesus. The high esteem, therefore, in which these
   martyred saints were held had consequences of a directly political
   nature for the surviving confessors. They were considered to be
   inspired in an extraordinary degree--according to Jesus' promise that
   the Spirit should be their advocate when they should be delivered up
   for judgment--and so they came to be the rivals of the bishops.

   The ascetics formed the second class of the saints. 1 Cor. vii. and the
   enigmatic and uncertain saying of Jesus concerning those who made
   themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake in Matt. xix. led
   many in very early times to attach a superior sanctity to the single
   state. This form of asceticism was reckoned as the token of an especial
   charism. Separate orders of virgins and of widows came into being. The
   author of the Lucan writings helps to exalt and to glorify them by his
   enthusiastic description of the widow Hannah and of the virgin Tabitha.
   By the time when the Pastoral letters were written the honourable title
   of widow must have been very grossly misused. Not only was greater
   sanctity attached to it, but considerable support was assigned to the
   widows by the congregations. Thereupon widows with large families of
   children presented themselves for admission into the sacred order, or
   quite young widows whose secret intention was to marry again. The
   energetic manner in which the author sets about the reform and
   reduction of the order of widows is very entertaining. He is fighting
   at the same time for the episcopal authority, upon which these holy
   ladies often trench. From the very first the ascetic was the natural
   rival of the bishop. He had the greater sanctity, the bishop the
   greater dignity. If the ascetic began to boast into the bargain, then
   strife was scarcely to be avoided. "The ascetic is not to boast"--the
   words of warning come to us from a document of the first century--"for
   he knows that it is not from himself that he has received the strength
   to be continent." Bishop Ignatius writes to Bishop Polycarp still more
   uncompromisingly: "If a man possesses the power to remain continent
   then he shall refrain from vaunting in honour of the body of the Lord
   [i.e., of the Church]. If he vaunts, then he is lost; and if he is
   accounted more highly than the bishop, then he has utterly perished."
   That sounds like the motto for the great war that was to be waged for
   centuries between the official position and the holy life, between the
   bishop and the monk. The esteem in which the ascetic life was held was
   still further increased by certain mystic tendencies: the marriage with
   Christ did not appear to be quite capable of realization save in the
   case of the unmarried. Then there was the loathing felt for the only
   too familiar heathen life of impurity, together with various forms of
   the late-Jewish and foreign aversion to nature. Even at this early date
   asceticism was exalted to the highest honour in current legends.
   Abundant proof of this statement can be found in the Acts of the virgin
   Thecla, in almost all the apocryphal Acts of Apostles, and in the
   Gospel of Mary. Entire continence is everywhere accounted the higher
   and truer form of Christianity. No wonder that the bishop fell into
   disrepute and that the episcopal author of the Pastoral epistles
   inveighs loudly against those emissaries of the devil who forbid
   marriage. In the eyes of a great portion of the Christian community the
   ascetics appeared to be the only people who had seriously set out in
   quest of the ideal of the Gospel.

   The beginnings of the voluminous literature of hagiology can be traced
   back to the end of the first century. The series is begun by the
   Gospels; Jesus Himself appears in them as the first of the saints,
   though He is, it is true, at the same time the messenger of the clear
   Word of God. The various Acts of the Apostles follow next; they reflect
   the ideal of popular piety. The men of God are there depicted as
   converters of the heathen, as workers of miracles, as ascetics, and as
   martyrs. It is possible that our canonical book of the Acts is the
   first of this group of literary productions. But the editor reproduces
   the legend of the saints with an ecclesiastical bias and writes as a
   conscious advocate of episcopal authority. In the apocryphal writings,
   on the contrary, the saint is pourtrayed without any ecclesiastical
   coloring. They are the last products of the dying enthusiasm. Human and
   divine here melt into one; the miraculous forms the rule, the ordinary
   the exception. The tendency is throughout ascetic and anti social, but
   secular interests claim their due in the romantic form in which they
   are composed. At bottom all these saints are, after all, caricatures of
   Jesus and of His great successor.

   Thus equipped with bishops, theologians and saints, the Church goes
   forward to meet the problems of the new age. There were no longer any
   great personalities with an immediate divine calling. That is not the
   fault of the Church. The time now came when second-rate characters and
   talents were strong enough to find a place for the new religion in the
   world and to preserve it from entire destruction therein.

CHAPTER IV.

  THE JEWISH FAITH.

   IT was only the Jewish war and the destruction of Jerusalem in the year
   70 A.D. that finally effected the external breach between Jews and
   Christians. It was now clear to all Christians that the mission of
   Jesus and the apostles to Israel had been in vain, and had not stayed
   the judgment of God. The fulfilment of Jesus' prophecies, the wrath of
   God poured out upon Jerusalem as a punishment for the murder of
   Jesus--such seemed (to all Christians) to be the meaning of the
   terrible events which had just taken place, for everyone who could read
   the signs of the times. And while these convictions were gaining ground
   among the Christians, the authors of the Apocalypse of Baruch and of
   Ezra were pouring forth their lamentations for the desolation of the
   holy land and the destruction of the holy city. Something was gradually
   settling down between Jews and Christians, something of greater weight
   than theological differences. A rift in thought and feeling was
   gradually broadening, which removed every possibility of mutual
   understanding. The same event called forth rejoicing and contentment in
   the one camp and dismay in the other.

   The Jews retaliated first of all by the expulsion of all Christians
   from membership in the synagogues. Everyone that espoused the cause of
   Jesus was immediately excommunicated with the most terrible curses. The
   passage in St Luke's Gospel alludes to this where it is written:
   "Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate
   you from their company and reproach you and cast out your name as evil
   for the Son of man's sake." A nice illustration is also to be found (in
   the Fourth Gospel) in the story of the man that was born blind. This
   man was cast out of the assembly, "for the Jews had agreed that if any
   man should confess Him to be Christ, he should be put out of the
   synagogue."

   A further step was taken when the Christians were denounced to the
   Roman governors under the pretext of being politically dangerous. The
   Jews were the principal instigators in the persecution of Christians
   that now began; it was they who sowed broadcast the accusations of
   revolt, innovation and conspiracy, and thrust Christianity from them as
   an "illegal religion." The Lucan writings contain a series of such
   denunciations: "Jesus perverted the people, forbidding to give tribute
   to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ a king." "The
   Christians have turned the world upside down; they act contrary to the
   decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus." It is
   true that, according to the narrative in the Acts of the Apostles,
   these accusations usually fell flat. The Roman governors were too wise
   and just not to turn a deaf ear to such fabrications. So it should have
   been, but such was not the actual state of affairs. We know, on the
   contrary, that in consequence of Jewish denunciations the Christians
   were condemned as innovators and revolutionaries dangerous to the
   well-being of the State. Even the Apocalypse couples the denunciation
   of the Jews and the persecution of the Christians together. The
   martyrdom of Polycarp is the best instance that we possess of the
   fierce hatred which the Jews nourished against the Christians. The
   voices of Jews mingle with those of the heathen multitude and clamour
   for the execution of Polycarp; then, "as usual," they drag the wood up
   to the stake, and finally they try to hinder the body from being handed
   over to the Christians. Political denunciation was, however, only one
   of the weapons which the Jews employed; the other, equally effective,
   was the defamation of the moral character of Jesus and the Christians,
   the wholesale dissemination of all those calumnious reports concerning
   the birth of Christ, the theft of His body after His death, and the
   like, against which St Matthew's Gospel already feels bound to protest.
   The whole story of Jesus was travestied and vulgarized, and thus
   exposed to the mockery of the educated classes. Although Justin's
   report of an official mission of Jewish calumniators soon after Jesus'
   death is legendary, there was a basis of fact upon which his
   supposition was built. The philosopher Celsus appears to have been
   acquainted with a Jewish pamphlet full of aspersions upon the
   Christians. He despises it himself, but for all that he enjoys making
   use of it. Thus, then, the Jews did their utmost to root out the
   Christians, and the wild hatred which these latter conceived for them
   was not altogether unmerited.

   The influence of Judaism upon Christianity would never have been of any
   consequence had the combatants confined themselves to these brutal
   methods of warfare. But from very early times controversy was employed
   as well as calumny. Thus the teachers of the two religions engaged in
   learned disputations, which naturally scarcely ever had any practical
   results, but did not fail to exercise a considerable influence upon
   men's minds. The earliest picture of such a disputation is to be found
   in the Acts of the Apostles. The record of the speeches and of the
   argumentation of St Stephen and of St Paul affords us at the same time
   an insight into the circumstances of a later age. Next, we have the
   disputes of Jesus with the Jews at Jerusalem, contained in the Fourth
   Gospel. Here the author simply carries back into the life of Jesus the
   wranglings between Jews and Christians of his own day. Lastly, in his
   dialogue with the Jew Trypho, Justin gives us the outline of a regular
   disputation, of course in a Christian light. This work of Justin's
   compensates in a measure for the loss of the older disputation between
   Jason and Papiscus, of which Aristo of Pella is said to have been the
   author. Justin's dialogue is in any case an authority of the highest
   value if we would determine, not only the outer procedure in such a
   disputation, but also the apologetic methods in detail. Other
   anti-Jewish writings, such as the Epistle to the Hebrews and that of
   Barnabas, afford us additional valuable information.

   If we ask, what was the subject of this controversy and what were the
   main points in the dispute, then we must be prepared to find that the
   specific differences between the Christian and the Jew had not been
   grasped at all by either party in the theological dispute. For in
   reality two completely different types or species of religion stood
   opposed to each other, and they could only be contrasted as wholes: it
   was not a question of single dogmas or customs; the point at issue was
   the entire relation of man to God. Does man claim to be God's child, or
   is he His slave? Are love and joy to prevail in him, or is it fear?
   Which is important in God's sight--the abiding in the three realities,
   or a hundred secondary matters? The answer to these fundamental
   questions was that which really differentiated the Christian from the
   Jew. But even in the earliest Christian Church the subject of
   controversy was less the new element in religion than the dogma of the
   Messiah. Could it be applied to Jesus in spite of His death or not?
   This dispute began the process whereby the fundamental points of
   difference were obliterated and obscured. Then, in addition to this,
   there came in, through Paul, the strife concerning the law. Paul sets
   up a sharp antithesis--the law or Jesus Christ. Here was at any rate a
   faint glimmering of the truth. It is because Jesus Christ is the only
   mediator between God and man and the barrier of the law no longer
   exists for the Christian, that His religion is of a totally different
   nature--it is the glorious liberty of the children of God. St Paul had
   indeed a profounder conception of the superiority of Christianity than
   any other man. But for the succeeding age the resulting difference is a
   merely external one. Compared with the Jews the Christians have at once
   lost and gained. They have lost the burden of the ceremonial law, they
   have gained the faith in Jesus the Messiah. In other words, the life of
   the Christians has become easier, their faith a harder matter. The
   expression of the comparison with their opponents could hardly have
   been less felicitous. Matters were made worse by the constant attempt
   of the Christian apologetic to transform the absolute antithesis
   between the law and Christ, such as St Paul had proclaimed it, into a
   merely relative difference whereby Christ was discovered everywhere in
   the Jewish Book, even in the law, and validity was claimed for the law,
   even in the Christian Church, only in a modified sense. The belief in
   Christ was itself to prove to be something Jewish and of extreme
   antiquity; and, on the other hand, the law was to be a revelation which
   only the Christians were able to read aright. By this apologetic device
   they deprived themselves of the very possibility of understanding the
   peculiar characteristics of Christianity and its superiority over
   Judaism. Nor is this the only occasion on which apologetics, instead of
   bringing light, have darkened counsel.

   We have now to give an outline of the Christological controversy
   between the Jews and the Christians and the Christological apologetics
   of the latter. The starting-point was the question: Is Jesus the
   Messiah expected by the Jews or not? But since St Paul had created an
   entirely new Christology--the Son of God from heaven, the mediator of
   creation and of revelation in the Old Testament--this speculation had
   also to be defended against the Jews.

   Here were two things as far as the poles asunder--Jewish eschatological
   doctrines and new Christian speculations. The dialogue with Trypho (ch.
   48) shows conclusively that the difference between Jews and Christians
   was clearly realized. Trypho says, that Jesus should be the Messiah is
   paradoxical, but to assert that He pre-existed as God and then became
   man in a supernatural fashion, is "not only paradoxical but foolish,"
   whereupon Justin admits that the proof of the second statement is
   rather more difficult.

   First of all, it had to be proved that Jesus was the Messiah. This was
   in reality no easy task, seeing that Jesus had eliminated nearly all
   that was Jewish from the conception of the Messiah and referred His
   disciples to the future for the little that remained. But the
   difficulty was no longer felt. It was maintained that Jesus had been
   acknowledged as the Jewish Messiah while He lived on earth. The chief
   rock of offence was now, as ever, His death, which the Jews interpreted
   as punishment for wrongdoing. Hence the greatest part of this Messianic
   theology is apologetics for the death of Jesus. The Resurrection there
   appears as evidence of restitution, and is itself defended by an
   ever-lengthening chain of proofs. When the Jews persisted in spreading
   abroad the report of the theft of the body of Jesus, the Christians
   invented the story of the watch and the sealing of the grave by way of
   refutation. The legends concerning the miraculous occurrences at the
   death of Jesus were in like manner furnished with the evidence of eye
   witnesses, and completed the story of the Resurrection.

   The proof from prophecy was intended to remove any further objections
   that might be entertained. In the first place, prophecies of Jesus
   Himself were fulfilled in the story of the Passion--there was a whole
   series of detailed predictions and of symbolical actions, from which
   the inference was to be drawn that He did not bow before superior force
   but died of His own free will. Next, the whole of the Old Testament was
   interpreted as the book of the death of the Messiah, not merely Isa.
   liii., but all the sacrifices and laws of the trespass offering, all
   the lamentations of the Psalmists, the sacrifice of Isaac, the scarlet
   thread of Rahab the harlot, the brazen serpent in the wilderness, the
   hands of Moses up lifted crosswise in the battle against the
   Amalakites, and so forth. Nothing was too recondite to deter them.
   Barnabas writes with the greatest equanimity, "The red heifer in
   Numbers xix. is the Lord Jesus." The later evangelists, especially St
   Matthew and St John, are careful to note the exact fulfilment of single
   prophecies in the history of the Passion. "In order that the scripture
   might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst."

   The last recourse of apologetics was the proof of the voluntariness of
   Jesus' sufferings. He could have asked God to send Him legions of
   angels, but He would not. If by the mere utterance of the words "I am
   He" He made His enemies fall to the ground, how easily might He have
   escaped from them. His life was His own to give or to keep, and if He
   gave it, then it was for our sakes and that the scripture might be
   fulfilled. Finally, the different legends about Judas were proofs of
   the judgment of God upon the traitor, and that was succeeded by the
   terrible revelation of His wrath upon the murderers and their city.
   More abundant proof could not be required of any apologetics. In the
   Gospels we can still see quite clearly how the apologetic narrative
   gradually increases in intensity. Mark always begins the series,
   Matthew and John always come last. In the same manner an
   ever-lengthening chain of Old Testament proof stretches from the Acts
   over John and Barnabas to Justin. The Christian teachers carefully
   preserved their store of apologetic arguments and handed it on with
   further additions. But their line of defence was after all pitiably
   weak, and the Jews broke through it and came out victorious in the end.
   The Christians admitted that Jesus' death destroys His claim to be the
   Messiah, if it were not that. . . . The want of taste in the reasoning
   is of little moment compared with the far more serious, wantonness with
   which passages were altered, perverted, or invented by the apologists.
   They inserted glosses of greater or less extent in several passages of
   the Old Testament (Son of God, Wood, etc.), and thereby rendered
   themselves liable to the charge of forgery. Nor was it any blessing for
   Christianity if, thanks to this apologetic of theirs, importance was
   attached even more exclusively than heretofore to the death of Jesus.

   The rest of the history was, however, not entirely neglected.
   Difficulties had to be removed and further proofs of the Messiahship
   furnished. The doctrine of Jesus Davidic descent was maintained in
   spite of Jesus' answer to the Scribes, and in spite of the story of the
   miraculous birth--now just beginning to appear among the Gentile
   Christians--which of course invalidates this argument. Barnabas alone
   rejects the descent from David in favour of the divine Sonship. A
   consequence of the Davidic descent was the postulate of the birth in
   Bethlehem (cp. Matt. ii. 5 and John vii. 42), which was clearly
   contradicted, however, by the fact that Jesus came from Nazareth. The
   postulate was transformed into history. The first evangelist shows us
   how it came about that Jesus, who had been born at Bethlehem, grew up
   at Nazareth, and the third explains how it was that the parents of
   Jesus, who were settled at Nazareth, came to have their child at
   Bethlehem.

   Galilee was, however, still the land of darkness. Can the Messiah come
   from Galilee? The first evangelist has recourse to the prophecy of
   Isaiah--the light of the Messiah is to spring up in Galilee. The fourth
   evangelist simply transfers the scene of Jesus' activity to Jerusalem
   in order that every reproach of Jesus having taught in a corner and in
   secret might be removed. This apologetic transformation of the life of
   Jesus equals in boldness the transference of His birthplace. One other
   apparent obstacle to the doctrine that Jesus was the Messiah had to be
   surmounted--the baptism of Jesus by John, for surely the Baptist is the
   greater, and the baptized is even a sinner. To counterbalance these
   inferences the first evangelist inserted the conversation in the course
   of which the Baptist humbles himself before Jesus; the third placed the
   Baptist in an inferior position through his previous history; the
   fourth made the Baptist to be the first publicly to confess the Son of
   God that came down from heaven to reconcile the world; and lastly,
   Justin proved that the Jewish doctrine of the anointment of the Messiah
   by Elijah had been fulfilled in the baptism of Jesus. In a similar
   manner we find that Jewish objections have had to be taken into account
   in very many places in the Gospel tradition. Although the Gospel of St
   Mark was itself inspired by a most enthusiastic faith and intended to
   awaken a like faith, it proved to be the source of considerable
   perplexity to later writers, for its author had evidently
   under-estimated the keenness of his adversaries' perceptions. With an
   entire absence of suspicion he lets the men of Nazareth speak of Jesus'
   trade as a carpenter, and tells us how Jesus own relations once took
   Him to be mad. He had shown Jesus' powers to be subject to limitation
   on all sides, even in the moral sphere. He will not suffer Himself to
   be called good; He knows neither the day nor hour of the Parousia; nor
   can He dispose of the places in the kingdom of heaven. He is repeatedly
   compelled to have recourse to questions. He asks the name of the demon,
   inquires who it was that caused power to go forth from Him by touching
   Him; or again, He would know the subject of the disciples'
   conversation, and the duration of the epileptic's malady. Even His
   miraculous power is limited. At one time He can do no miracles. At
   another all the sick are brought to Him, and He heals, not all, but
   many; He cannot make the blind man to see immediately; the deaf He
   heals, but with many sighs. When He is asked to confirm His position by
   giving a sign He refuses. Whilst these are the very features for the
   sake of which we, at this present day, ascribe the greatest historical
   accuracy to St Mark, his oldest Christian readers were greatly
   distressed by so many obvious defects in the picture of Jesus, which
   afforded such convenient points of attack for scornful adversaries, at
   first Jewish, and later Greek as well. Every later evangelist, Matthew,
   Luke and John, is therefore very eager to remove such rocks of offence,
   either through simply omitting them or by correcting them or by
   smoothing them away by means of explanation; and yet, as the criticism
   of the Jew in Celsus, and as Celsus himself shows us, more than
   sufficient points of attack remained. For us this is a great comfort.
   We sometimes fear lest the true figure of Jesus is lost to us because
   of the draperies in which it has been shrouded, and His true features
   hopelessly obscured because of the successive layers of colours under
   which they lie concealed. Here we have a proof that a real human being,
   and no mere product of faith, is speaking to us.

   The main question still remained unanswered as before: Does the life of
   Jesus as a whole give one the impression that He was the Messiah?
   Originally the Christians universally shared the belief that Jesus had
   yet to come as Messiah. The Messianic glory had not yet been revealed
   in Him. It was only the return of Jesus and the advent of Messiah" that
   was to furnish the full Messianic proof. But in the course of the
   controversy with the Jews, and under the influence of the Pauline
   conception of the Son of God who had already appeared, the proof began
   to be attempted that Jesus was the Messiah who had already come, and
   not the one whose coming had still to be expected. The task was an
   impossible one. Jesus' life was marked so clearly by the
   characteristics of a lowly origin, of suffering, of want, of distance
   from God. What proof could here be found of the Messianic glory in the
   Jewish sense of the word? All the national prophecies had evidently not
   been fulfilled by Him.

   The Christian apologists sought to surmount the difficulty in two
   mutually exclusive ways. The first, and the more honest, was the
   artificially constructed theory of the twofold advent of the
   Messiah--one in humiliation, one in glory. The first traces of this
   theory are to be found in the Lucan writings, where we have the
   explanation--first the suffering and then the glory. It is completed in
   Barnabas and in Justin, together with the proofs from the Old
   Testament. On the great day of Atonement there were two he-goats
   resembling each other, according to the Rabbinical theory; just so the
   Jesus of the second advent will be like the Jesus murdered by the Jews.
   This theory possessed one great advantage: the story of Jesus could be
   taken as it was in reality. But then the chief proof had to be deferred
   to the uncertain future.

   Hence the origin of the opposite theory. The Messianic glory was
   manifested during Jesus' earthly life. The first evangelist goes a long
   way to meet it with his great proof from miracles (ch. viii.-ix.), and
   the proof from prophecy throughout the whole of his book. One who
   possessed such miraculous powers, and in whom so many prophecies were
   fulfilled, was the Messiah in the fulness of His glory. He needed not
   to be baptized, He needed not to die. Characteristic, too, is the
   omission of the words, "Why callest thou Me good?" And yet all that
   this evangelist does, is a very modest beginning compared with the
   total transformation of the life of Jesus, effected in the Fourth
   Gospel in the interests of the Messianic theory. "When Christ cometh
   will He do more miracles than these which this man hath done?" This
   exclamation of the Jews might serve as a motto for the whole book. The
   evangelist's aim is the proof that Jesus was the Christ during His life
   on earth, and not in the future only. The future Parousia of Christ is
   an entirely subsidiary consideration: he has something better to offer
   than consolation by means of a hope that is still to be realized.
   Behold the Messiah, who has come in the full glory of God. The mighty
   miracles, the changing of the water into wine, the healing of the man
   who had been lame for thirty-eight years, and of the man born blind,
   the feeding of the five thousand, the walking on the sea, the raising
   of Lazarus after three days--they are all signs of the Messiahship of
   Jesus, the revelation of His Messianic glory; for they are all of them
   wonders, such as could only be expected to occur in the Messianic age.
   This Messiah possessed sinlessness, omniscience and omnipotence upon
   earth. Jesus' death was voluntarily a proof of His love. How could
   anyone fail to believe that He was the Messiah? To meet the demand of
   the Rabbis, who were forever clamouring for testimonies, authoritative
   proofs, the fifth chapter of the Gospel furnishes a whole concatenation
   of proofs--the testimony of John, the wonders, the voice of God, the
   Old Testament. Then again he investigates the difficult questions
   whether the testimony of Jesus to Himself is valid or not, and decides
   that it is, because Jesus' testimony carries greater weight than that
   of any man, His knowledge being subject to no limitations, and as it is
   always accompanied by the testimony of God, it fulfils the requirement
   of the law that testimony shall be in the mouth of two witnesses. Hence
   furthermore, as a natural consequence, the Messianic judgment was
   executed by the mere appearance of Jesus, and the Messianic gift of
   everlasting life was imparted by Jesus; for the presence of the Messiah
   implies judgment and everlasting blessedness. John was merely the
   apologist who consistently drew all the consequences from the
   proposition that Jesus was the Messiah. Had it depended upon him, the
   Christians might entirely have discarded the proof from the Parousia
   while retaining the hope in the Parousia itself. But the Church did not
   accept this theory. It was rejected even by as early a writer as
   Justin. The impression of Jesus' lowly life left by the Synoptic
   Gospels was too strong and the hope in the Parousia too important for
   the great mass of the Christians. The only theory which held its ground
   was that of the double Parousia. This did not imply, however, the
   rejection of the Christ of glory as He appeared in the Johannine
   Gospel. For the Gentiles especially the evangelist thereby furnished a
   proof that God had appeared upon earth. Thus, then, while John did not
   attain his proximate aim by his unsparing idealization of history--that
   is to say, the refutation of the Jews--he did make a deeper impression
   upon the Greeks than he would have done otherwise. John himself is in
   reality perfectly well aware that however many testimonies he may
   gather, his arguments do not carry conviction to any learned Jew. He
   alone that has the Spirit can understand the Christian doctrine, can
   recognise that the death of Jesus was a judgment, not upon the
   Crucified, but upon the devil, and that the Old Testament is full of
   types of the death of Jesus. That is the conclusion of every
   controversy.

   Jesus had not been the Messiah of the Jews. The whole artificial series
   of proofs brought forward by the Christians simply corroborates this
   assertion. All that they advance is figment, feint and fabrication. No
   single Christian had the courage to tell the Jews straight out: Jesus
   was not that which you wish Him to be, because He was something a great
   deal better.

   There were, of course, many Christians to whom the title of Messiah did
   not imply very much, though that which they substituted for it was in
   no wise better. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews belongs to
   this class. Although he calls Jesus Christ he knows practically nothing
   of the Messianic theology, and therefore the Jewish Alexandrine school
   of thought to which he belongs attached no importance to this doctrine.
   His favourite book is the Pentateuch, which makes no mention of the
   Messiah. When he wishes to picture Jesus clearly to himself and the
   Jewish readers of the Bible he can only do so by means of the types and
   conceptions of the Pentateuch. Hence he derives his favourite idea,
   Jesus the high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.

   His letter is addressed to Christians, but to such as are deeply
   impressed by Judaism. Christianity--so some of these Christians would
   say to each other--is a poor and insignificant kind of faith. It is
   forever putting us off with hopes for the future which are never
   realized, whilst Judaism has its divine institutions in the present.
   They were jealous of the ecclesiastical privileges of Judaism, just as
   so many Protestants secretly envy Rome her prerogatives. Israel had
   angels as mediators of the covenant, it had its public worship and its
   divinely ordained priesthood, and derived the certainty of its future
   salvation from these actual guarantees. The simple fact that the war of
   the year 70 A.D. had swept away the Church of Israel did not cause
   these Christians to waver in their partiality for Judaism. They
   believed the sacred book more than the actual present.

   The usual result of apologetics can be traced in our author. Instead of
   brushing these preposterous objections aside he takes them into
   consideration and really tries to prove that the Christians possess the
   better Church with a higher ritual and priesthood. It was an amazing
   undertaking. The method employed was to apply the Pentateuch to Jesus.
   But Jesus was not of Aaron's line, and had He been He would but have
   been the equal of the Jewish high priests. So our Christian author
   selects the figure of Melchisedec, naturally incited thereto by the
   110th Messianic psalm, which had for a long time past been interpreted
   in a Christian sense. He need trouble himself as little about the Jesus
   of history as St Paul or the author of the Apocalypse. It is sufficient
   for him to identify Jesus with the high priest Melchisedec in order to
   undermine the foundations on which the prerogatives of Israel rest.
   Melchisedec hereby does our author the same good turn that Abraham had
   done St Paul. He furnishes the proof from antiquity. As high priest
   after the order of Melchisedec, Christ is older than Levi and Aaron.
   The whole Jewish priesthood paid tithes and did reverence to
   Melchisedec in the person of their ancestor Abraham. It is one of the
   pleasant little ironies of history that the very character which had
   been invented by the Jews for the express purpose of in vesting
   Jerusalem with a halo of magnificence in a remote antiquity, should now
   be used as the lever whereby all Jewish prerogatives were overthrown.

   Starting from this figure, our author proves on the one hand the
   similarity of Christ to the Jewish high priests, but above all, the
   difference that exists between them and His superiority over them. The
   priests of Aaron are many, Jesus one; they are the sinful, He the
   sinless; they worship in the temple made with hands, He in the heavenly
   temple; they make atonement to God year by year, He once; they with the
   blood of bulls and calves, He with His own. In all this clever trifling
   it does not of course matter that Jesus is explained now as priest and
   now as victim, for the author never employs that imaginative power
   which welds different features into one consistent picture. It is
   possible that he is influenced by another typical figure in the Jewish
   faith, that of the heavenly high priest Michael, believed by the Jews
   to represent their people continually in the sanctuary of God in
   heaven. Philo had already identified this archangelic high priest with
   his Logos. Philo's pupil--our author--may very well have combined the
   Melechisedec Christ with the heavenly Michael in like manner. But this
   is merely supposition. What is certain is that the figure of Jesus was
   now distorted for good and cast into a priestly mould so that such
   Christians as were attached to the old Jewish high priest might have
   some compensation for their loss. The whole comparison is a theological
   tour de force. Thank heaven, the real Jesus was the outspoken opponent
   of the high priest. To take from the high priesthood the colours for
   His portraiture was pure perversity.

   We do not really enter the domain of speculation until we come to the
   title Son of God.' The expression was originally a mere title for the
   Messiah, though even as such it was by no means common in the
   terminology of the schools. St Paul was the first to develop the theory
   of the heavenly Son of God, whose nature is inherently superior to our
   own. He is God's own true Son, whereas we only become His sons by
   adoption. As Son of God He is to be conceived as dwelling in heaven
   from all eternity. This Pauline theory of the Son of God was
   immediately accepted by the teachers of the sub-apostolic age (e.g.,
   the authors of the Epistle to the Hebrews, of St John's Gospel, and the
   letter of Barnabas) as a certain basis on which to build. It was now
   also drawn into the controversy with the Jews.

   The Jews clung firmly to their belief that God was the Father of all,
   so that they might call themselves His children. They altogether
   refused to accept Jesus as the Son of God in an especial sense. The
   Christians answered by denying the Jewish faith in God the Father, and
   by separating Jesus still more sharply from men. In St John's Gospel
   Jesus is made to tell the Jews in awful words that they are the
   children, not of God, but of the devil. A truly terrible statement, for
   it destroys the presupposition of Jesus' whole teaching--the divine
   Fatherhood. There is no longer anything childlike in the religious
   relationship, nor is a direct approach to God possible. The
   consequences immediately make themselves felt for the Christians. They
   are no longer sons of God, as St Paul still calls them, but children'
   of God, i.e., the divine Sonship is reserved for Jesus. Hence forward
   God the Father and God the Son--with the addition of the word
   only'--belong together as in the later Trinitarian dogma. The
   expression God the Father in the earlier sense is confined to prayers.
   Theology knows it no more. The teachers who are responsible for having
   effected this change in reality perpetrated a robbery upon Christianity
   which only escaped notice because of the ardour of their apologetic
   zeal.

   If, however, the Son of God was thus removed from the children of God,
   then the question as to His relation to God was bound to come to the
   front at once. Once more the Jews were the instigators. They accused
   the Christians of apostasy from monotheism, of pure idolatry. Our
   oldest Gospel, St Mark, refers to this accusation when it tells us that
   Jesus was condemned to death as a blasphemer because He had called
   Himself Son of God; then the Fourth Gospel reproduces the charge made
   by the Jews in so many words: "Jesus by calling God His Father makes
   Himself equal with God." "He blasphemes God in that He being a man made
   Himself God." This accusation is, of course, directed against the
   worshippers of Jesus, and not Jesus Himself. For the first time the
   Christians are exposed to the painful reproach of endangering the pure
   faith in God by their faith in Christ. The whole abyss stands revealed
   between the Pauline theology and the words of Jesus, "Thou shall
   worship God alone: no one is good but God." When John appealed to the
   passage in the Psalms, "I have said, ye are Gods," it was merely a
   theological evasion. The only inference from this passage was that the
   Old Testament itself did not employ the word God very strictly; nothing
   was gained thereby for Jesus' cause. There was only one means of
   rebutting the accusation that the Christians worshipped two Gods, and
   that was distinctly to declare Jesus' entire subordination to God. Such
   was John's escape from the dilemma. He makes Jesus Himself confess that
   the Father is greater than He, that He received all things from the
   Father, and has nothing of Himself, that in all His works He follows
   the Father and fulfils the Father's work. St John's Christology is a
   compromise between the pure divinity of Christ, to which the evangelist
   nearly attains, and the unity of God, the dogma brought forward by the
   Jews in opposition to it. This compromise--the theory of
   subordination--owes its origin to nothing else than the anti-Jewish
   apologetics. After all, this impaired divinity is a mythological
   figure. The absurd antithesis now arose, the Jews merely had the
   Father, but the Christians the Son in addition. That was not John's
   opinion, for he says that he alone has the Father, who has the Son, but
   it was held by many Christian laymen. He that confessed this did, of
   course, at the same time admit that Judaism was the higher religion,
   free as yet from mythology.

   The development of the Pauline Gnosis led the Christians a great deal
   further than the defence of the divine Sonship. Since the days of St
   Paul it was a universally accepted opinion that the whole of the Old
   Testament bore witness to Jesus as Lord. Both at the creation and in
   revelation He had acted mediatorially and vicariously. Now, as the
   Lord' is the Old Testament name of God, really all that is wanting in
   St Paul's account is the name God for Jesus. The thing was there. As
   regards the Jews this was a complete innovation. The framework of the
   old Messianic theology was broken. The Jews protested, We dare not
   accept a second God. The Old Testament knows only one God--the Creator,
   and His servants--the angels.

   In spite of this protest the Christological exegesis of the Old
   Testament prevailed in the Church. According to the Epistle to the
   Hebrews God created the world through His Son. This Son, the effulgence
   of the divine glory, is highly exalted above all angels. It is of Him
   that we read in the Psalms, "Let all the angels of God worship Him."
   And, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
   earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands: they shall perish,
   but Thou continuest." Thereby the Jews are confounded with all their
   loud boasting in the revelation of angels.

   John, too, declares that God created the world through His Son, the
   Logos. But above all it is through Him that He revealed Himself to men.
   All theophanies, e.g., that of Isaiah, were Christophanies. It was
   Christ who came to the patriarchs: even then children of God arose in a
   wonderful manner through His word of promise. No man ever saw God.
   Wherever, therefore, God is described as coming to man in the Old
   Testament, we must apply the words to Christ. The Epistle of Barnabas
   follows along the same lines. For him, too, the Lord of this world is
   the Son, and it is generally acknowledged amongst the Christians that
   God spoke to Christ when He said, "Let us make man." It is only with
   Justin, however, that we enter into the midst of the controversy with
   the Jews regarding the Old Testament. Both Christians and Jews accept
   the fact of the existence of mediators for God's revelation to man as
   certain. The use of the plural in Gen. i., the mention of the angels
   and archangels of God, the wisdom of the Book of Proverbs, compel us to
   admit this conclusion. The question is merely between Christ and the
   angels. Now, since in many of the narratives in Genesis and Exodus the
   expressions God' and angel of God' are interchanged, Justin concludes
   that the heavenly visitant must be more than an ordinary angel (for He
   is God), and yet not the highest God (for He is an angel). He is
   therefore the Son of God, the second God. However great his efforts,
   the Jew Trypho cannot quite escape from the horns of this dilemma.
   Justin also shows us to what an extent the Christological exegesis of
   the Old Testament has already proceeded.

   What are the names by which Jesus is known in the Old Testament? Word,
   Wisdom, Day, the Rising Star, Sword, Stone, Staff, Jacob, Israel,
   Joseph, Judah, Archangel, Angel, Apostle, Man, Son of Man, Child, King,
   Priest, God, Lord, Glory of the Lord. That is to say, Jesus is
   everything in the Old Testament.

   Trypho's comment upon this is very effective: "Very well then; you
   Gentile Christians may be worshippers of this Lower Deity, but let us
   continue to be worshippers of the highest God." That hits the nail upon
   the head. It is a choice between monotheism and mythology. The
   Christians preferred the latter, because they thereby rendered
   themselves masters of the Old Testament, and because it was better
   suited to the needs of such as were Gentiles.

   The Christians were fully persuaded in their own minds that they had
   come forth from this controversy with the Jews victorious in all
   points. They had satisfactorily proved Jesus to be the Messiah by
   wonders and prophecies; they had proved Him to be a high priest
   according to the order of Melchisedec, to be Son of God, to be Lord and
   God in the Old Testament. They had started from the Messianic proof of
   the early Christian Church and the Gnosis of St Paul; and upon this
   foundation they had continued to build without change of plan. A
   straight line of succession can be traced from St Paul through St John
   to Justin. Proceeding from the secure basis of the Pauline Gnosis, the
   surrounding country is conquered until the whole of the Old Testament
   becomes a Christian book, and the Lower God stands beneath and by the
   side of the God of creation. But the controversy with the Jews mightily
   furthered and hastened this theological work.

   And yet this victory over the Jews implied at the same time an
   increasing alienation from Jesus Himself. It is an awful spectacle:
   here we have theologians fighting for Jesus, taking up arms in His
   defence, exalting Him, deifying Him, and at the same time inventing
   texts in His favour, transforming and perverting others, and all the
   while they never asked who He was in reality and what His aims were.
   The subject of all this anti-Jewish apologetic is never really Jesus,
   but the titles of Messiah, Son of God, and the like. The evangelist,
   who is the ablest champion of this defence of the faith, composes a new
   life of Jesus without any compunction as a theological commentary or
   canon of interpretation for the stories which he found to hand. No
   single Christian said what he might have said: "Jesus is our Redeemer,
   because He led us to God, because He freed us from the Scribes, because
   He made our lives wholesome and honest as against the Pharisees,
   because He inspired us with glad hope, forgiveness, courage and joy."
   All this is to be found, to be sure, in the first three Gospels, though
   not as the real proof. The following, on the contrary, is indicated as
   the line of action to be pursued. He that would defend Jesus must first
   of all give Him the right titles; he must prove these titles by wonders
   and by prophecies; he must ransack the whole of the Old Testament for
   corroborative matter, and all the while care as little as possible for
   the real Jesus. This plan had such wide-reaching effects that to this
   day it is difficult to retain one's joy in Jesus in the teeth of all
   Christological fables.

   The Christological controversy served to keep alive amongst the
   Christians the sense of the contrast between their religion and that of
   the Jews. Simultaneously, however, a strong current was making for a
   silent and gradual approximation of the Christian faith to that of
   their adversaries. Jewish eschatology, the Jewish belief in angels,
   even Jewish conceptions of God Himself, pass over into the Christian
   Church more and more extensively, though without at first attracting
   notice.

   In its origin Christian eschatology was merely a form of the Jewish.
   All that Jesus did was to simplify and denationalize the Jewish hope.
   Even in St Paul we notice a very great increase in apocalyptic
   conceptions, theories as to the metamorphosis of the body, the
   concatenation of catastrophes, Antichrist and his destruction. Next the
   Christian Apocalypse regularly flooded the thoughts of the future hope
   with the Jewish Apocalypse. Nor did the process cease: it continued in
   an increasing measure. One single fact proves this more than an entire
   series of treatises. The whole of the later Jewish apocalyptic
   literature, even that which dates from after the year 70 A.D., crosses
   silently over to the Christians, and is held by them in canonical
   estimation. The Epistle of St Jude employs the books of Enoch and the
   ascension of Moses; Barnabas uses the Apocalypse of Ezra; Hermas the
   prophecy of Eldad and Medad; Papias actually quotes a text from the
   Apocalypse of Baruch as a saying of Jesus. And by the side of this
   apocalyptic literature a whole mass of eschatological mysteries passes
   over to the Christian teachers by oral tradition, so that the further
   we are removed from Jesus the more abundant the esoteric Jewish
   doctrines as to the future which we encounter amongst the Christians.
   This applies, e.g., to the legend of Antichrist, but not to it alone.
   If in spite of 1 Cor. xv. the belief in the resurrection of the flesh
   obtained a firm footing as Christian dogma, Jewish influences may very
   well have been at work here. Chiliastic fancies dominate not merely
   bishops like Papias, whose critical powers are not very great, but even
   theologians like Justin, and give rise subsequently to a great movement
   in the Church through Montanus and his prophetesses. In spite of all
   Hellenistic influences, the gaze of Christians is ever turned
   expectantly towards the Holy Land in which Messiah is to descend
   together with the heavenly Jerusalem. One feature alone is wanting in
   this Utopia--Israel's political position; in every other point the
   majority of Christians are Jews as regards their hopes for the future.
   Nor was this attended by any immediate evil consequences. Very soon,
   however, the influx of the Jewish eschatology caused a line of cleavage
   to appear between the enlightened and educated, who abominated these
   sensual expectations, and the plain and simple Christians, who clung to
   them with all their heart and soul. The greater inroads Judaism makes,
   the greater the severity of the subsequent conflict between the
   Hellenistic and the Semitic spirit in Christianity.

   The belief in angels naturally formed an integral part of Christianity
   from the very first. Yet how very little Jesus says about angels. So
   close is the connection between Him and His disciples and the Father
   that there is no room for any intermediary beings. Here, too, St Paul
   takes up the position of Jesus. He will not suffer the intervention of
   angels in the relationship to God. He is at bottom opposed to angels,
   whom he almost always pictures to himself as being hostile to God, and
   tempting men away from God. Once again it is the Apocalypse which
   submerges Christianity under a flood of Jewish fancies. Here the angels
   regularly occupy an intermediary position between men and God. They are
   the channels of all communication from earth to heaven, to such an
   extent that angelolatry has already to be forbidden. One of these
   angels, Michael, is considered to have vanquished Satan in heaven, and
   ranks as a kind of redeemer. The process thus begun, continues
   according to the rule: the further removed from Jesus the deeper the
   descent into Judaism. Our Gospels are very instructive in this
   connection. The first old tradition which they incorporate is as yet
   free from angelology, but in the later the secondary parts, in the
   stories of the birth and the resurrection, angels, e.g., Gabriel, have
   an important role assigned to them. It is only in St John that the idea
   then emerges that Jesus' intercourse with God was effected by means of
   a constant ascending and descending of the angels. But it is the book
   of the Acts which best shows us how important the faith in angels had
   become by this time for the ordinary layman's religion. Angels are
   pictured as the constant companions of the saints: they counsel and
   comfort them, and set them free from grievous dangers; but for simple
   Christians too they are mediators carrying men's prayers up to God, and
   bringing back His answers. An average Christian has henceforth more to
   do with the angels than with God. Every page of our principal authority
   in angelology, the "Shepherd" of Hermas, proves that this statement is
   no exaggeration. To begin with, his knowledge about angels is
   boundless. There are the seven archangels, and their head, Christ.
   There is the angel of repentance, the angel of punishment, the two
   angels of righteousness and wickedness, the angel of the prophetic
   spirit, the angel of pleasure and of deceit, the angel Thegri, who is
   set over all animals, and many more. The very fact that he sometimes
   mentions Christ by the side of the archangel Michael and sometimes sets
   Him in his stead, proves that his faith in Christ is only intelligible
   to him as a special case of his belief in angels, but that at the same
   time he cannot quite rearrange the angelic hierarchy to suit his own
   ideas. Angels are the intermediaries in the whole sphere of religion.
   Men are handed over from one angel to another for their higher
   education, and so God's purposes are carried out. This angelology
   appeared to the Christians at one time to be so important that they
   formulated it dogmatically. The Apocalypse begins with the salutation
   from God, from the seven angels before His throne, and from Jesus. In
   like manner Justin defines the Christian faith as belief in God, in
   Christ, in the angelic host, and in the Holy Ghost, although he is
   acquainted as well with the enumeration of the Holy Ghost in the third
   place. Here, too, it is quite possible to account for the firm footing
   which this belief in angels obtained in the Church by the admission of
   the Jewish Apocalypses, the chief source of Jewish angelology. But oral
   intercourse with the Jews did more than anything else. However caused,
   this importation cannot be considered to have been a blessing.

   The Christian faith in God inevitably suffered loss through the influx
   of so many later Jewish speculations. It is wonderful how rapidly the
   early faith in God the Father deteriorates. Men like St Paul and St
   John, who stand on the same high level as the Gospel of Jesus, do
   indeed from time to time give glad expression to their faith that God
   has manifested His love to us as the Father. But these same
   theologians, writing as apologists, proclaimed the terrible God of
   wrath or the hidden, unapproachable God who decrees death upon all who
   stand without the Church. What wonder, then, if even within the Church
   Christians but seldom obtained or retained the joyful trust in God the
   loving Father, and were content with His deputies and substitutes,
   Christ, the angels and the saints. At present, no direct intercourse
   with God is possible, for He is surrounded by His heavenly court
   filling all the heavens and encompassing Him so closely that no eye can
   pierce through it. It is only in the future, when the angels shall have
   smitten the whole earth with their plagues and executed their
   judgments, that one may hope that God will appear upon earth in mercy,
   though still inspiring terror. So Christians and Jews alike had once
   more reverted to the old conception of God, and the resulting frame of
   mind was a state of suspense, a perpetual oscillation between fear and
   hope, neither trust nor joy. And this again brought about the further
   consequence that the Christians, not being able to take their stand
   firmly upon the redemption, which Jesus had really effected, were the
   more inclined to look for their superiority in the wrong quarter, i.e.,
   in the vain imaginations of Christology.

CHAPTER V.

  THE LAW AND JEWISH ETHICS.

   NEXT to Christology the question as to the law was the chief point of
   contention between Jews and Christians. Since Paul had proclaimed the
   annulling of the law for all Christians, they had remained practically
   free. Isolated attempts on the part of the Jews to reintroduce the law
   among the Christians were at once energetically repulsed--we need but
   look at the Epistle to the Hebrews, and at that of Barnabas. In
   Justin's time, things have come to such a pitch that those who cling to
   the law after the manner of the old Jewish Christians are denied all
   hope of future blessedness by many members of the Church Catholic. It
   was impossible to go back upon the position laid down by St Paul. But
   to formulate and establish his theses soon proved to be impracticable.
   He himself had gone no further than to declare that the law had been
   annulled. The Jews forthwith reproach the Christians with having fallen
   away from the faith of the fathers in order to live in a state of
   immoral license. All that St Paul said about the influence of the Holy
   Spirit and one's baptismal obligations was in vain. The absence of law
   meant licentiousness. The reproach of the Jews was all the more
   dangerous as they had an appearance of right on their side with their
   political denunciations. Thereby they compelled the Christian
   apologists to take up a positive position towards the law. The point to
   be proved was that far from being apostates, the Christians alone truly
   observed the law. In reality they were maintaining that which was not
   true. No man in all the world ever observes the Sabbath, circumcision
   and the regulations concerning food, by not troubling about them. This
   was not the first time, however, that the art of the theologian managed
   to turn No into Yes, and Yes into No.

   The First Gospel makes the earliest attempt in this direction. It is
   possible that the great declaration in the Sermon on the Mount, "I came
   to fulfil the law, not to destroy it," may have been originally
   inserted by Judaizers. It is certain, however, that the words, as we
   read them to-day, are to be taken, not in a Jewish sense, but in that
   of the Catholic Church, and only thus obtained a footing in the Church.
   This is proved by the mere fact of the addition, "and the prophets" to
   the word "law." Jesus here simply declares that He is the true
   interpreter of the Old Testament, that He alone has seized its inner
   meaning, and that this meaning is to be accepted by the Church.
   Naturally this is only possible if the interpretation be free and
   allegorical, in other words, Christian. Christ is the second Moses, who
   has seized upon the true meaning of the law. The Christians, therefore,
   do not transgress the law but fulfil it.

   The addition, "and the prophets," is very characteristic of the methods
   pursued by the Christians in their apologetic. Whilst the Jews take
   their stand firmly upon the law and fight against the Christians from
   this basis, the latter substitute the "law and the prophets" in their
   defence: they shelter themselves behind the Old Testament as the word
   of God, of prophecy. Both the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Lucan
   writings, and the Johannine Gospel convert the controversy as to the
   law into one concerning prophecy. The law, too, is to be read as
   foretelling Christ. St Luke's procedure is very instructive in this
   connection. In the source which lay before him he found the saying: "It
   is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the
   law to fall." He could not simply omit the saying. It was too well
   known, and one had to define one's position towards it. He therefore
   inserts in front of these words as to the eternal validity of the law
   the other statement, "the law and the prophets were until John," in
   order at least to indicate their meaning. And then he further shows in
   what sense they are to be interpreted by the concluding words of the
   following parable. Moses and the prophets are the road to Faith, the
   law is to be forever valid as a prophecy leading to Christ. Hence Paul
   says in the Acts, "I believe all things which are according to the law
   and which are written in the prophets"; and so too Jesus says in the
   Fourth Gospel, "If ye believed Moses ye would believe Me; for he wrote
   of Me"; as though the important matter in the case of the law were
   believing and not much rather doing. Now, as soon as the law is itself
   regarded as a prophetic book the contrast between the law and Christ of
   course entirely disappears; the law can itself be explained as the
   Revelation of Christ, who is the giver of all prophecy and every word
   of God. This is what John has done. He was the first to regard the law
   given by Moses as a subordinate and merely preparatory gift of the same
   Logos who afterwards appeared in Jesus Christ in all His mercy and
   truth. Here the Pauline controversy as to the law is almost entirely
   forgotten. The law is itself regarded from a Christian point of view,
   but it ceases to count as law in the earlier sense of the word.

   In spite of all, however, the controversy continued. It could not be
   definitely settled by simply smoothing over the real points of
   opposition. The fact that the ceremonial law was no longer obligatory
   upon Christians had to be established by some clear theory. The first
   attempts to discover such a theory are to be found in the Epistle to
   the Hebrews and the speech of Stephen. The transitory nature of the
   ceremonial law is proved from the Old Testament itself. If God,
   speaking by the prophets, foretells a new covenant and a high priest
   after the order of Melchizedek and therefore not of Aaron's, He Himself
   declares the old legislation to have been superseded. The severe
   sayings of the prophets directed against sacrifices and the temple, in
   which God Himself rejects the Jewish ceremonial, point in the
   direction. These indications are expanded into a fully developed theory
   in Barnabas; he was one of the most outspoken opponents of Judaism, and
   at the same time devoted heart and soul to the Old Testament. The
   starting-point of his criticism is the story of the breaking of the
   tables of the law by Moses as he descended from Mount Sinai; which
   signified that God had already gone back upon the covenant which He had
   proclaimed with Israel in order that the Christians might be the first
   to have the true covenant with Jesus sealed in their hearts. This
   criticism could, however, be refuted from the book of Exodus itself,
   and was therefore rejected by the Christian teachers. The opinion that
   God had given the law in a Christian spirit and that the Jews had
   misunderstood it in taking it literally, having been visited by an evil
   spirit, was of greater importance subsequently. Barnabas rests this
   theory upon numerous anti-ceremonial prohibitions in the prophets which
   proved to him that God does not desire their literal fulfilment. But
   this criticism was also unsatisfactory, failing as it did to
   distinguish sufficiently between the different parts of the law and
   verging perilously near upon Gnosticism by its assumption of a Satanic
   temptation. The only portions that held their ground were, first, the
   spiritual interpretations given to circumcision, the Temple, the
   regulations concerning food and the Sabbath, all of which were
   presumably a good deal older than Barnabas, and then, secondly, the
   important thesis: "We Christians have Christ's new law, which is the
   law of liberty."

   Justin was the first to find a satisfactory explanation of the
   difficulty, and his answer has been accepted ever since by the Church.
   He collected the apologetic works of his predecessors, and also
   contributed to the collection. Peculiar to himself and decisive for the
   future was his comprehensive view of history, with the leading thought
   of the divine education of the human race, and the acceptation of the
   Stoical conception of the everlasting law of Nature. The development
   was effected gradually. The righteous men of pre-Mosaic times knew the
   everlasting law of Nature, and by fulfilling the same attained to
   blessedness. Then God caused it to be written down in the Decalogue for
   the first time. And finally, after that it had been obscured in a
   variety of ways, Christ the new Lawgiver restored it again by setting
   up the two commandments of love. In Christianity, therefore, we simply
   have the eternal moral law restored to us in its original purity and
   perfection. God only gave the ceremonial law for a transient purpose.
   The Jews were marked by circumcision as a punishment, and the other
   ceremonial laws were added because of the hardness of their hearts to
   keep them from idolatry. True, the ceremonial law has an inner meaning
   which is for all time, besides the literal meaning which was but for a
   season, but then this inner meaning was not clearly revealed before
   Christ came. We find these thoughts of Justin's expressed still more
   clearly and consistently by Irenaeus. Supported by these theories the
   Christians no longer felt themselves to be apostates but the possessors
   of a knowledge of the divine purpose in the granting of the law, which
   placed them in a position of proud superiority.

   The significance of the whole of this controversy was purely
   theoretical. The actual freedom of the Christians from the law was its
   presupposition; it needed to be sanctioned, it already existed as a
   matter of fact. Nor, thanks to this same theoretical character, had the
   new doctrine, that Christianity is the new legal religion, any bad
   consequences for the moment. This very doctrine, which had originated
   in the endeavour to meet Jewish views, was now employed to justify the
   breach with the Jews. Formally the point was granted, there must be a
   law, but the concession was merely the steppingstone to the actual
   victory gained by the purely moral conception of the law. It was fatal,
   however, that the thesis as to the new law obtained a footing at the
   very time when Judaism had just begun to make its way into Christianity
   from another direction.

   For, whilst the controversy as to the validity of the national law was
   occupying public attention, a far more important process was pursuing
   its silent course with entirely opposite results. All that was
   essential in Jewish ethics was tacitly being accepted by the Church,
   just as the apologetic and angelology in the domain of faith. The
   squabbles of theologians are not the only objects of importance in the
   world. The greatest changes are effected quietly by the natural
   exchange of ideas in social intercourse without being either prohibited
   or permitted.

   The reasons for this influx of Jewish ethics into the Christian Church
   are evident. The words of Jesus were at first but little known, and
   scanty as they were in number they referred to but a few of the many
   relations of life. But Paul himself had made very frequent use of the
   Old Testament, especially of the Proverbs and Psalms. It was easiest to
   follow him in this direction. Almost all the ethical admonitions, e.g.,
   that are contained in 1 Peter, 1 Clement, and also in St James, are
   based upon the Jewish proverbial philosophy in the Psalms, Proverbs,
   and also the Prophets, Ecclesiasticus and Wisdom of Solomon, or they
   are founded upon the Old Testament narrative as the great collection of
   moral examples. For all these Christian teachers the ceremonial law has
   simply been annulled, but the moral treasures of the sacred book they
   do not intend to give up under any considerations whatever. But in so
   doing they appropriate a system of ethics which has a character quite
   of its own--the ethics of later Judaism.

   The procedure of the Christians was, moreover, exactly the same here as
   in the domain of faith. They took over the most recent Jewish writings
   of an ethical character and turned them into Christian tracts by a few
   scanty additions. An unquestionable instance of this is to be found in
   the Jewish Testaments of the twelve patriarchs, an example of an
   exceedingly copious and lofty moral literature, to which were appended
   a few Christological statements. The origin of the little tract
   concerning the two ways--the Way of Life and the Way of Death--is not
   quite so certain. It now stands at the commencement of the Didache as a
   catechism for proselytes, but we meet with it before this at the
   conclusion of the Epistle of Barnabas. The tract originally formed an
   independent work. There is nothing Christian about it, nor are
   parallels wanting in the nearly-related Jewish literature for the
   absence of everything that is distinctively and nationally Jewish. But
   the fact that a Christian and a Jewish origin can be maintained for the
   same writing is in itself remarkable. The exceedingly close resemblance
   between later Jewish and Christian ethics alone renders this possible.
   The commandments and parables of Hermas likewise set forth a morality
   which is closely connected with that of the Testaments, and must be
   called Jewish, if we except a few sentences. Probably Hermas really
   made use of Jewish tracts. It is worth noticing, too, that so powerful
   a Christian work as the Epistle of St James could be considered Jewish
   on account of its surprisingly abundant points of contact with Jewish
   moral writings.

   The presuppositions of these later Jewish and early Christian ethics
   strike us to-day as strangely childlike. Every human being is placed
   between God and the devil. Both would influence him and win him over.
   For this purpose they send forth their angels or spirits to him. Now
   these are nothing but the various moods and feelings, fancies and
   impulses, which are conceived of as something foreign to the man and
   due to external influence. We find it is true beside this, the
   impersonal conceptions of lust, pleasure, and conscience as immanent
   powers. Man is completely free to decide between good and bad.
   According to his decision the good or evil spirit wins the upper hand
   in him and the thought passes into deed, with the consequent reward or
   punishment. Even after the deed is done man retains his freedom. If he
   has hitherto followed the evil spirit he can choose the road of
   repentance which leads home again. Not only the Testaments and the
   commandments of Hermas, but the Epistle of St James and even the First
   of St Peter presuppose conceptions such as these.

   From the abundant ethical material of all these writings we can easily
   recognize what appeared to be of especial importance to later Judaism.
   First of all, as a rule, comes the demand to believe in the one God,
   the Creator of the world, i.e., the confession of monotheism in
   opposition to the polytheism of the converts surroundings. "Believe
   thou, above all, that there is one God who hath created all things."
   Such is the beginning of the commandments of Hermas, and the Two Ways
   begins in a similar fashion. That there is one God is the fundamental
   article of the creed which even the devils believe. All the catalogues
   of virtues in Hermas begin with faith. Thoroughly Jewish, again, is the
   circumstance that Hermas immediately adds the fear of God to faith, and
   the Two Ways describes religion as the "fear of God." Indeed that is
   the name which is characteristic of Jewish propaganda everywhere.

   The next thing that is enjoined is usually continence or chastity: the
   commandment to keep oneself unspotted from the world. The whole world
   appeared to the religious man of that age to be a temple of immorality,
   be it in deed or merely in desire. The manifold temptations with which
   the religious man is assailed in his goings out and his comings in are
   minutely described, sometimes too minutely, so that they acquire an
   especial interest of their own. For it cannot be maintained that
   Judaism merely took sins that were actually committed into account. The
   distinction between sins of fact and sins of thought was one with which
   it had long been familiar, and through the greater inwardness of the
   moral claim it had only too often been led to a weak and even morally
   dangerous introspection of motives and the birth of sin. By its
   detailed examination of the origin of an evil lust in the author's
   heart, the first vision of Hermas provides a commentary on the text in
   St James: "People are in every case tempted by their own
   passions--allured and enticed by them. Then the passion conceives and
   gives birth to sin, and sin on reaching maturity brings forth death."
   Hence the exhortation to the strictest vigilance and discipline of the
   senses. Men are warned against the dangers, not only of immorality, but
   also of drunkenness, against the eagerness to acquire wealth and to
   seek amusement, against luxury; and the close connection between these
   sins and the first, which is the greatest of all, is pointed out.

   Next to chastity we hear most frequently of singleness of heart, and of
   its contrary double-mindedness. The ideal of the religious life was
   held to include the earnest endeavour to attain to a morality which
   should be at once complete, clear and simple, lifted far up above all
   doubt and hesitation or secret participation in the forbidden fruit,
   and of transparent sincerity both in what it did and in what it left
   undone.

   Within the narrower circle of the brethren, sympathy, benevolence and
   compassion are esteemed most highly. To visit the widows and fatherless
   in their affliction is almost the half of true religion for St James
   and also for Hermas. At all times the Jews have achieved very striking
   results by their works of charity to the poor of their own faith. A
   proof of this is the wonderful amount of cohesion that existed amongst
   the Jews of the dispersion. At the same time, however, they exaggerated
   the value of such charity to a terrible extent. The text, "Love covers
   a multitude of sins," which made its way from later Judaism into all
   early Christian writings, as though it were the most important article
   in the creed, is taken to mean, "Almsgiving lightens the burden of
   sins." But, on the other hand, a more inward signification was attached
   to compassion and pity. And the inference was then drawn in a manner
   which reminds us almost of the Gospel itself, that all anger, jealousy,
   envy and hatred are of the evil one and must be combated.

   It is by no means easy clearly to characterize the difference between
   these late Jewish ethics and the ethics of the Gospel. The latter have
   evidently found an ally in the former. Both agree in their indifference
   to all that is merely national, in their greater inwardness, in their
   extension of the claim of morality to the whole of man's life. We come
   across Christian sayings, even reminiscences, of Jesus in St James'
   Epistle, although the author is probably almost entirely unacquainted
   with the words of the Gospel.

   And yet it is a new ethics which now enters into the Christian
   Churches. The most striking characteristic is legality. It would be
   going a great deal too far, it is true, to ascribe its origin to the
   influence of Judaism alone. It is a constantly recurring feature in the
   history of religion that that which began in the freedom of spirit
   ended--was bound to end--in the restriction of law, for it is only
   possible to discipline large masses of men by laws and institutions.
   This process was still further accelerated in the Christian Church by
   the rise of the Gnostic heresies which in many cases proclaimed an
   entire emancipation from law and order, to the ruin of the Churches.
   Judaism played a very important part, however, in the introduction of
   the idea of legality into the Church. The Old Testament and later
   Jewish literature, which was read for purposes of edification to the
   almost entire exclusion of every other, presented the religious
   relation predominantly as one of obedience to the law resting upon
   positive divine authority and confirmed by threats and promises.

   In his Jewish source Hermas found a parable describing the dispersion
   of the people of God--the Israelites--all over the world under the
   protection of the law. The archangel Michael was the governor of this
   people, and gave the law to each individual Israelite. Varying results
   followed, and these the parable indicated by its distinction of three
   principal classes: the righteous, the sinners who have not as yet lost
   all hope of repentance, and the utterly lost. The law he explains as
   being the Son of God, and the people of God as the different peoples
   who have accepted the Faith. But a few lines further on he forgets his
   Christian exegesis, and is completely under the influence of his Jewish
   source. Even the name and office of Michael are left unaltered. He
   speaks of the law and of the law alone. Martyrs are men who have
   suffered death for the law, while there are others who were grievously
   oppressed for the law--though they were not actually put to death--and
   did not deny their law. The meaning which he attaches to the law is, of
   course, quite different to that which it possessed in his Jewish
   source, but the form is the same. Like Hermas, James introduced purely
   Jewish legalism into the Christian congregations; and in whatever other
   devotional writings we find emphasis laid upon the keeping of the
   commandments as the most important factor upon which reward and
   punishment depends, these old Jewish associations are exercising their
   influence by the side of the teaching of Jesus.

   The consequences of this legal view of morality were exactly the same
   as those which manifested themselves in Judaism. The moral ideal is
   divided up into a number of single equivalent commandments which soon
   defy every attempt at comprehensive survey. They have to be learnt by
   heart as something external, something that derives its authority
   entirely from its divine origin and the system of rewards and
   punishments, i.e., from results. Now, too, the practice of drawing up
   long lists of virtues and vices becomes increasingly common among the
   Christians. The tract of the Two Ways is a model for such lists. First
   of all, the chief sins are enumerated in the order of the Decalogue and
   forbidden; then follows the prohibition of the roots of these sins in
   desire, thought, and speech. The Testaments of the twelve patriarchs
   ascribe a vice or a virtue to each of the patriarchs, which are then
   examined at length in their origin and their consequences. The
   commandments of Hermas treat of the single virtues or vices
   successively and separately in quite a similar manner, whilst other
   portions of the book give us catalogues of virtues arranged according
   to the numbers 7 and 12. Traces are not absolutely wanting in Hermas
   that he perceived the necessity of an inward connection of the virtues
   in man; but he is quite incapable of setting forth this connection
   clearly. The author of the Epistle of St James, too, has an idea,
   though he is unable to give it anything but the baldest and most
   external expression, that moral action is, or at any rate ought to be,
   an individual whole. There is a continual process of addition and
   subtraction; where one is wanting, the sum is not complete. Then, too,
   faith and works stand to each other in a perfectly external relation.
   Man is no longer placed face to face with the three great realities: he
   is immersed in a sea of details where no one knows exactly what is
   important. The only connecting links between these separate commands
   are the divine sanction and the consequences preordained by God. That
   is "good" which has been revealed to mankind by God and His angels,
   and--so the Christians go on to say--which Jesus and His apostles have
   taught, and which has the promise of future reward.

   But as soon as the positive law sets up a criterion of good and bad,
   the conception of works of supererogation, of merit, arises. Even St
   Matthew had connected alms, prayer and fasting in his Sermon on the
   Mount as acts done for God's sake and meriting special reward. But it
   was Hermas beyond all others who sanctioned the Jewish idea of merit'
   by his prophetical writing. He discovered a parable in his source
   intended to illustrate this very idea. There was a servant who did a
   good work in addition to the task laid upon him by his Master, and then
   divided the reward which was allotted to him among his fellow-servants,
   thereby meriting a double reward. So in like manner fasting is doubly
   meritorious: firstly, as a good work in addition to that which God has
   commanded; and secondly, in so far as one denies oneself something in
   order to divide it among the poor. Hermas did, it is true, write a
   criticism of fasting by way of a preface to this parable, and gave it a
   Christological interpretation; but the Jewish theory of merit can be
   read between the lines, and obtains a firm footing.

   The diffusion of this same conception was still further aided by the
   code of morals current among the Jewish proselytes. There were
   proselytes of different degrees; such as only subjected themselves to
   the Jewish morality of the Two Ways, and such as took upon them the
   whole yoke of the Lord. It was only the second that led to perfection.
   The insertion of the catechism for proselytes into the Christian
   Didache gave this theory of a double standard of morality--with
   modified demands in the second case--apostolic sanction. In other
   cases, too, the fatal use of the word perfection' passes over from
   Judaism to Christianity. In St Mark Jesus calls upon the rich man to
   sell his goods, else he would not inherit eternal life; but St Matthew
   says else he would not attain to that perfection, which goes beyond
   obedience to the commandments. On the other hand, in St Matthew, the
   saying of Jesus as to the turning of the other cheek is still a
   command, it is a part of God's will, to do which is for all men the way
   into the kingdom of God. In the Didache we find a tendency to account
   this a special mark of perfection, and inasmuch as it takes this
   command and the similar sayings concerning love for one's enemies and
   boundless liberality as illustrations of the divine love and not of the
   love of one's neighbour, it must be held to be in a great measure
   responsible for the transformation of the core and centre of the claim
   of Jesus into a work of supererogation. The best way of realizing how
   far removed from the teaching of Jesus is this tendency to attach an
   especial value to the performance of more than duty requires, is to
   recall Jesus' parable about the unprofitable servants immediately after
   reading the fifth parable of Hermas.

   But by far the worst consequence of the encroachment of legalism upon
   morality concerns the religious relation itself. Religion is again
   turned into a legal relation of performance and reward. God is the
   taskmaster and judge; man His slave who seeks to earn his reward in
   fear and trembling. Owing to the Jewish source from which he worked,
   this change is to be found very largely exemplified in Hermas. Every
   deed, be it good or bad, is recorded in the heavenly account-book, and
   every change of fortune is considered as the divine answer to man's
   actions. Hence all misfortune is looked upon as punishment, with the
   possible exception of martyrdom, and even in this case its value for
   the sinner consists in its being repentance for his sins. If the
   misfortune appear to be greater than the merited punishment, then it
   must be supposed to have a supererogatory efficiency, and to be
   punishment for the sins of other members of the family. According to
   strict justice, the punishment lasts exactly as long as the sin has
   been indulged in; but for our feelings a day of pleasure corresponds to
   a year of torment. Amongst the evils and misfortunes which the author
   is especially fond of looking upon as punishments, may be mentioned
   business losses, illness, disorder, ill-treatment at the hands of the
   unworthy. And yet if one meets with any one of these misfortunes one
   may still account oneself happy, for it is a proof of the divine
   education--God wishes our betterment--a sign that one need not fear
   retribution in the world to come. And then again we come across another
   genuine Jewish feature. God is not entirely tied down to this legal
   system. The Jewish religion is ever a religion of justice, and of mercy
   besides. As Almighty Sovereign, standing above all law, God can,
   according to His own good pleasure, set strict justice aside, and
   pardon. He then merely strikes out the debit side of the account.
   Hermas is full of the praise of God's mercy; he thence derives all his
   comfort. Were it not for this we should despair. This arbitrary
   exercise of mercy, however, which at times breaks through the framework
   of the legal religion, changes one's general impression but little. It
   does not allow of the growth of any unshaken confidence. There is no
   cessation of that alternation between hope and fear which characterized
   Judaism before Jesus and St Paul, which must exist wherever an external
   law intervenes between God and man.

   The second principal characteristic which sharply differentiates the
   ethics influenced by Judaism from the ethics of the Gospel is its
   ecclesiasticism. This tendency, too, originated independently in the
   Christian Churches, and merely received a powerful impetus through the
   pattern presented by Jewish ethics, which for a long time previously
   had tended to accentuate the contrast to the heathen world, and to
   tighten the bonds of ecclesiastical unity. St Paul had already been
   strongly influenced in this point by the ecclesiasticism of Jewish
   ethics. All that his successors did was to continue and to exaggerate
   what he had begun.

   In the first place, the Christians take over the position occupied by
   the Jewish synagogue towards the Gentiles. The conceptions Gentiles'
   and world.' are, generally speaking, an inheritance from Judaism. The
   Jew included all the peoples and states of antiquity in all their
   manifold variety as one uniform mass under the conception of the
   nations' (Gentiles), and contrasted them with his Church as an unclean
   world under the dominion of demons. St Matthew's version of the Sermon
   on the Mount shows Jewish colouring in this particular. Those who are
   felt to be furthest removed from the Christian ideal are called
   Publicans and Gentiles. "Do not even the publicans the same?" "Do not
   even the Gentiles the same?" and so again, "Let him be unto thee as the
   Gentile and the publican." The evangelist does not notice how badly
   this colouring of his words harmonizes with Jesus own life. As for
   Hermas, his thoughts and words are entirely influenced by this theory.
   The righteous, sinners, heathen--such is his division of mankind. The
   righteous are inheritors of the world to come. The sinners and the
   heathen are lost; the former because they sinned and did not repent,
   the latter because they knew not their Creator. "They consorted not
   with the righteous, but lived together with the heathen." Such is the
   judgment upon one class of sinners. How would Jesus have stood in this
   judgment? But as it was necessary after all to have dealings with the
   Gentiles, definite rules to regulate this intercourse had to be drawn
   up. The so-called decree of the apostles, the prohibition of
   fornication, of meat sacrificed to idols, of blood, and of strangled
   things, which was not yet current in St Paul's time, is to be entirely
   ascribed to Jewish influences. For there was nothing more abominable to
   the Jews than eating meat sacrificed to idols. The Didache speaks of it
   as the sacrifice of death, employing a Jewish term in order to foster
   this feeling of abhorrence. The prohibitions of blood and of snared
   game are in like manner Jewish. The starting-point is the Jewish
   psychology which the Christians appropriate. According to Jewish
   conceptions, the pure Jewish blood is tainted by fornication, hence
   this is coupled so frequently with idolatry. The passing of this decree
   does not imply a victory of the old Jewish Christianity, but merely of
   Jewish modes of thought with regard to the world.

   The converse of this strict separation from the Gentiles is presented
   by the intimate relation of the brethren. Paul copies the Jews in this
   point and goes beyond them. Clement refers his panegyric of love to
   love of the brethren within the Church, and surely not without some
   reason. When Paul, summing up his moral exhortations, speaks of love as
   the bond of perfection, we are involuntarily reminded of the Jewish
   catalogues of virtues in which love is always the keystone of the arch.
   One of the most important manifestations of this love--though it is by
   no means exhausted herein--is benevolence to one's co-religionists.
   Love, peace, and humility belong together, and together constitute the
   complete character of a faithful member of the Church such as Clement
   holds up to the Corinthians as an ideal. Humility does not, in this
   case, denote fasting, as it usually does in Jewish writings; it rather
   describes the subordination of the individual to the community in
   contrast with a proud individualism. That is the specifically Catholic
   conception. Hermas, again, shows us how his Jewish sources were bound
   to confirm this tendency. We hear their complaints of such as follow
   their own insight instead of the understanding of others, and who
   thereby go astray; about such as quarrel with each other, and do not
   live at peace with each other, but are always causing schisms and
   divisions; about such as do not unite in fellowship with God's
   servants, but holding themselves aloof, destroy their souls. In like
   manner the catechism of the Two Ways enjoins upon all Christians:
   "Daily shalt thou seek the face of the saints that thou mayest be
   refreshed by their conversation. Thou shalt create no schism, but be a
   peacemaker between them that strive." This is radically different from
   the saying of Jesus, "I came not to send peace but a sword."

   No one will reproach the young Christian Church for seeking instruction
   and advice in its ethics from the older and far more experienced Jewish
   Church. The position of both Churches was at bottom the same. Why
   should the younger pass by the treasures of wisdom of earlier
   generations? But then one must not be astonished to find Christian
   ethics retrograding in many places to the position in which Jesus and
   Paul found them.

CHAPTER VI.

  THE JEWISH CHURCH AND ITS INSTITUTIONS.

   JESUS had prophesied the destruction of the Jewish Church. The external
   rupture between the Christians and that Church had been brought about
   by St Paul, since whose day the Christians had stood outside of any
   ecclesiastical communion with the Jews. But it was none other than St
   Paul who had done more than all others to found and consolidate the new
   Christian Church; and this in two ways. First, he laid down the theory
   that the way to salvation led through the ecclesia of Jesus Christ
   alone, and that all were lost who remained as unbelievers outside of
   the Church. Only the believer will be saved, "extra ecclesiam nulla
   salus." But at the same time he established a connection between the
   new Church and the Israel of old, by means of his gnosis, through the
   theory: "The Christians are the Israel of God, the spiritual Israel;
   all pious Jews of pre-Christian times were Christians before Christ."

   The immediate consequence of these great theories of St Paul was that,
   generally speaking, the Jewish ecclesiastical idea struck deep root in
   Christianity and grew apace. Hence the further result that customs and
   institutions of the Jewish Church were taken over into the Christian.

   The most remarkable feature was the assurance with which the
   Christians, who, after all, were mainly recruited from among the
   heathen, proclaimed themselves as the true Israel of God. There is
   scarcely a single Christian who knows anything of a new Church, or says
   that Jesus founded the Church. The Christian Church is of immemorial
   antiquity, and the Christians are simply the Old Testament people of
   God. The emphasis which is placed upon the antiquity of the Church is
   often due, as in the Acts, to apologetic considerations. The reproach
   of schism and of unauthorized innovation is thus guarded against. The
   same consciousness is, however, shared by purely devotional writings,
   which have no connection whatever with apologetics. The decisive factor
   was the supremacy of the Old Testament in all Christian communities.
   One could only read and love the Old Testament, if one found therein
   the history of the fathers' of one's own people. As soon as the
   Christians began to reflect upon the matter from a theoretical point of
   view, they had to confess that the Jews were the primitive stock and
   the heathen Christians the proselytes. The authors of the Apocalypse,
   of the Acts and of the Fourth Gospel, say so quite plainly. But the
   very candour of their statements proves the entire insignificance of
   the distinction. There is no idea of the proselytes being in a position
   of inferiority. All Christians are on a level in faith in Christ, and
   that is all that really matters. It is quite in accordance with the
   opinion of the majority of all Christians, when the book of the Acts
   represents the passage of Christianity from the Jews to the heathen
   simply as a progress ordained and devised by God, or even merely as a
   case of geographical expansion. All rifts and chasms were carefully
   concealed. All that men saw was the continuity of the history of the
   chosen people, its progressive evolution from the days of the
   patriarchs, kings, and prophets down to Christ, and thence to the
   apostles and the Gentile Church. The only dark passage in all this long
   history was the unbelief of their own contemporaries, the Jews; but
   then an explanation was sought and found for that in their obstinacy.
   Apart from this riddle all was clear, simple and satisfactory.

   Whether the Christians called themselves people of God,' or Church,'
   was really a matter of in difference to them, for the Old Testament
   provided them with both expressions. The word people' or peoples of
   God,' seems, however, to have been the more popular. A man like the
   author of the Apocalypse knows but the one contrast: the people of God
   and the Gentiles. There are, besides, "those who call themselves Jews
   but are not," i.e., the name of Jew belongs solely to the Christian
   people of God. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews lives
   especially in the idea of the Old Testament congregation with its
   divine institutions; but he finds, too, in the Old Testament the great
   company of heroes, the fathers of the faith, who light the Christians
   on their onward path. It never occurs to him that the righteous men of
   the Old Testament never confessed the Christian faith. They are all
   Christians in his eyes. Strangest of all, however, is the view of the
   Old Testament held by the author of the Lucan writings. He does not
   merely live in the distant past of the saints of old as though it were
   in that preliminary chapter of Christian history which he so dearly
   loves to narrate again in his long speeches (the reformer Stephen
   dwells at greatest length upon the patriarchs). No; he transfers his
   love to great portions of the Judaism of the time of Christ and His
   apostles. No Christian author has written with greater pathos and
   enthusiasm of Jerusalem and the Temple than he. Take the pictures of
   Simeon and of Hannah, take the story of the boy Jesus in the Temple, or
   the description of the pious worship of the early Christians in the
   Temple. The attempt has been made in all these instances to trace a
   Judaistic mode of thought dating from early times. Nothing could be
   more perverted. Our author's thoughts are simply catholic. Because the
   Christians are to him nothing but the Old Testament people of God, he
   is glad to record their attachment to the sacred institutions and
   customs of the Old Testament. His successors, the authors of the
   apocryphal histories of the birth of Jesus, followed in his steps.
   There we find nothing but enthusiasm for the Temple and the priests,
   and vows and sacrifices, and yet of Judaism no trace at all. That is
   the difference between the old time and the new. The old time was a
   time of strife. The new time has so completely forgotten the strife
   that it is able to interest itself in its former opponent and to love
   him in so far as he denotes the necessary preliminary to its own
   existence. Finally, the proud feeling of the Christians that they are
   the divine people of the Old Testament appears in a classical form in
   the First Epistle of St Peter. It is to Gentiles that the author
   writes: "You are a chosen race, a royal priest hood, a consecrated
   nation, God's own people." This passage from the book of Exodus had
   already been quoted in the beginning of the Apocalypse, where we read:
   "Christ made us to be a kingdom and priests unto God." In both
   instances the text is quoted in writings intended at once to minister
   comfort and to sound the battle-cry. In the days of persecution, the
   Christians were especially fond of recalling the distinction between
   the chosen people and the Gentiles.

   The other expression Church' meets us rather more rarely in the
   sub-apostolic literature; but (and this is significant) more especially
   in the writings which are in closest touch with Judaism. The evangelist
   Matthew, himself a born Jew, as he knows how to read the original
   Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and even follows the order of the
   books, is one of those who appropriate the Jewish term Church.' By the
   Church' he understands not only the single congregation which in its
   local organization is sharply distinguished from the Gentile world, but
   also the Church Catholic, that great juridical body corporate, the
   government of which Jesus is said to have handed over to Peter as His
   successor and vicar. All that Peter determines as legislator in the
   Church shall be valid for the kingdom of God. For by the power of the
   keys, the right of binding and of losing, is signified ecclesiastical
   legislation. Unfortunately we know neither when nor where the
   celebrated passage was written. In all probability the Roman Petrine
   tradition and the consciousness of Roman power here find utterance for
   the first time. For the first time, too, and surely not merely by
   chance, the Church and the kingdom are almost identified in this
   important ecclesiastical document. In a passage peculiar to St Matthew,
   Jesus says to the Jews: "The kingdom of God shall be taken away from
   you and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof."
   What is the kingdom of God which the Jews have possessed? It is not, as
   in other passages, the future Messianic kingdom, but the theocracy, the
   divine rule. The evangelist might just as well have said, "Ye shall no
   longer be the Church." In other places St Matthew distinguishes between
   the kingdom of Christ, the present Church, and the kingdom of God, the
   ideal Church. It is quite natural that a man who had the interests of
   the present Church so much at heart should identify it in thought with
   the coming king dom. But by so doing he has taken a great step forward
   in the direction of Roman Catholicism.

   It is a remarkable coincidence that the other old writing, the
   "Shepherd" of Hermas, which speaks most about the Church, certainly
   dates from Rome, and was written by a Christian who was perfectly
   familiar with Judaism. In the third vision and the ninth parable he has
   made use of a Jewish document which describes the building of the tower
   of the Jewish Church with the stones of the depths, i.e. the fathers
   before Jacob, with the stones of the twelve mountains, the twelve
   tribes of Israel, and with the stones of the plain, the proselytes.
   This Jewish parable he interprets as signifying the Jewish Church, but
   makes it refer at the same time to the kingdom of God, which is once
   again an instance of the close connection between these two conceptions
   at Rome. Again, in a thoroughly Jewish fashion the Church is described
   as being exceedingly old, for it was created first of all things, and
   the world was made for its sake. There is an exact parallel in the
   Apocalypse of Ezra: God created the world for the sake of His people.
   Several other passages about the Church, partly of a speculative
   nature, which are contained in the "Shepherd" of Hermas and in the
   Second Epistle of St Clement, which likewise dates from Rome, can only
   be explained as imperfectly understood plagiarisms from Jewish sources.
   The Church is, e.g., declared to have been created before all else,
   before the sun and the moon, because the Spirit which animates the
   Church is, according to Gen. i., older than the world; but turn the
   page and we read that God created His Church only on the sixth day of
   creation, and blessed it when He created man and woman, because the
   embryonic Jewish Church began with the first pair of human beings.
   Those are, to be sure, harmless speculations enough. The important
   point is this, it was first of all at Rome that the Christians felt
   themselves to be a Church and the beginning of the kingdom of God.

   We meet with the same close connection between Church and kingdom of
   God in the so-called eucharistic prayers of the Didache. "As this bread
   was scattered upon the hillside and being gathered together became one,
   so may Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the world into
   Thy kingdom." "Be mindful, good Lord, of Thy Church to deliver it from
   all evil and to perfect it in Thy love, and sanctify Thy people and
   gather them together from the four winds into Thy kingdom that Thou
   hast prepared for them." These were not really Christian eucharistic
   prayers at all. They were prayers in use among the Jews of the
   dispersion, and were recited at the meals of the assembly. Our
   Christian author adapted them for the service of the Church. The hope
   in the reunion of the scattered children of Israel and their future
   return to the land of Palestine is a part of the unchanging framework
   of Jewish prophecy. Through these prayers it passed over into
   Christianity and there confirmed the feeling of ecclesiastical unity.

   The necessary consequence of the acceptation of the Jewish idea of the
   Church was the acceptation of all the narrowness and the intolerance
   which this idea implied amongst the Jews. It is, of course, possible
   that the Christian congregations would have been impelled to make these
   extravagant and intolerant claims quite of themselves, urged thereto by
   the sense of their superiority to their surroundings, and by their
   consciousness of power. But this abstract possibility may safely be
   disregarded, since the influence of the Jewish Church, which is the
   only other adequate cause, is so patent at every step. "Extra ecclesiam
   salus nulla," comes to be the motto of the Christian religion. It is
   only the symbol that has changed. It is not the ceremonies, the Jewish
   blood, that are efficacious, but the Christian faith. But the high
   claim, the exclusiveness, the compassionate contempt of the Gentiles,
   are transmitted to the new people of God. True, faith was a spiritual
   possession, and yet one is bound to ask oneself whether a Church which
   demands faith in the ecclesiastical Trinity stands very much higher
   than one which forbids diverse kinds of food. That which constitutes
   Jesus' wonderful greatness, His open eye for righteousness and goodness
   wherever it was to be found, amongst publicans, Samaritans, or
   Gentiles, can no longer be fitted in with either conception of the
   Church.

   The limitation of salvation to the Church is, it is true, very seldom
   expressed in so many words. The apologetic writings which preach the
   idea most zealously, the Acts and the Fourth Gospel, do not once
   mention the Church. They only speak of Christ and Faith, but then that
   is the Church. At all times zeal for Christology has been zeal for
   ecclesiasticism. The highest titles are assigned to Christ. Blessedness
   is centred in Him alone, and thus the demand is made for entrance into
   the Church. St Paul had led the way by setting up the theory, "Only he
   that believes can be saved." The author of the Acts follows: "Believe
   in the Lord Jesus, and thou and thy house shall be saved," i.e., become
   a Christian. "In none other is there salvation; for neither is there
   any other name under heaven that is given among men whereby we should
   be saved." The author of the Fourth Gospel takes the last step by
   transforming these thoughts of St Paul and St Luke into actual words of
   Jesus. "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no one cometh unto the
   Father but by Me." "Unless a man be born of water and the Spirit, he
   cannot enter into the kingdom of God." The two propositions are
   identical. Only by entrance into the Church is blessedness to be
   acquired. No sentences in the whole of the New Testament bear a more
   catholic meaning than these theses of the two Christian apologies. John
   is perhaps the narrowest and most uncompromising theologian of the New
   Testament. In the entire degradation of John the Baptist, in the
   proclamation of the hard-heartedness of the Jews and of their descent
   from the devil, in the verse, "All that have come before me are thieves
   and robbers," he reveals a skill which is almost awful in pulling down
   and thrusting into hell all that stands outside of the Christian
   Church. And his procedure appears to be all the more violent, because
   he forces Jesus Himself into his service in order to legitimize it. But
   what was to happen to the pious Jews who died before Jesus came upon
   earth without having learnt the Christian faith? Most Christian
   teachers did not recognize any difficulty whatever in the question,
   since they simply regarded all pious Jews as virtually Christians. That
   is why St John speaks of the Logos as present in the world, and in
   communion with His own long before His incarnation. It is because he is
   convinced that all patriarchs and prophets were Christians, children of
   God who believed in His name. Hermas is the first for whom the question
   as to the salvation of the Jews of the Old Testament presents any
   difficulty. He starts from the proposition that only he that bears the
   name of the Son of God, i.e., only the Christian, can enter into the
   kingdom of heaven. Now as the pious Jews were not baptized, and
   consequently not Christians, he assumes that the righteous men of the
   Old Testament were baptized in Hades, after having previously listened
   to the preaching of Christ by the apostles and teachers who had
   descended into Hades. That was no bad solution of the problem. He who
   seriously believed in the strict limitation of salvation to the Church
   had to satisfy his narrow mind by means of absurd shifts such as these.

   Fortunately, however, the genuineness of the picture of Jesus as we
   find it in the Synoptic Gospels has not been impaired by all the later
   ecclesiastical additions, and the fanatical narrowness of the faith of
   His adherents is thereby repeatedly condemned. The great examples of a
   breadth of view which were entirely non-ecclesiastical, were not to be
   rooted out. All those sayings of Jesus remained unimpaired, that the
   moral element alone--the fruit--is decisive in God's sight, and
   everything else worthless: that it is righteousness, love, and justice
   that God requires, and that these qualities please Him all the world
   over wherever they are found. How do the ecclesiastical authorities
   manage, then, to make the Jesus of the Gospels suit their theories?
   They attach ecclesiastical conclusions to the Gospels. The evangelist
   Matthew closed his work with the command of the risen Lord to
   evangelize and baptize, which confines salvation to the Church. The
   Gospel of St Mark received the concluding verses which are recognized
   as not genuine, and which contain the proclamation: "He that believeth
   and is baptized shall be saved, but he that disbelieveth shall be
   condemned," and this was put into Jesus' mouth! The author of the Lucan
   writings likewise makes the risen Lord utter the ecclesiastical
   command, repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His
   name to all the nations; and shows besides this in the Acts where
   salvation is alone to be found. Then came the Fourth Gospel and
   declared that all that was contained in the previous three must be
   understood in accordance with the teaching of the Church, and after an
   orthodox fashion. Thus the evangelist harmonized Jesus and the idea of
   the Church.

   But for this later time the principle of salvation limited to the
   Church set up by St Paul had to be taken in the catholic sense that the
   Church did indeed afford the necessary presupposition for salvation,
   but by no means guaranteed it. St Paul had still hoped that his
   congregations would all enter into the kingdom as the elect of God's
   mercy. The sub-apostolic age was obliged to relinquish this optimistic
   faith entirely. It was by no means merely the Gnostic division which
   impelled men to take a more sober view of the Church. The fact that
   "average Christianity" was perpetually on the increase in all the
   congregations was too evident to be ignored, and that especially in
   seasons of persecution when the chaff is winnowed from the wheat. So we
   find the author of the Apocalypse plainly telling his fellow-Christians
   that whole congregations (Thyatira, Sardis, Laodicea) are in danger of
   being lost, or at any rate of enduring the day of judgment in very
   small minorities. Away, then, with all comfortable assurance of
   salvation! Only he that endureth in the last great tribulation shall
   obtain the crown of everlasting life. The author of the Pastoral
   letters and the first evangelist put forth their theories, which
   closely resemble each other, about the same time. The former compares
   the Church to a great house in which besides the gold and silver
   vessels there are also vessels of wood and vessels of earth, and some
   are to honour and the others to dishonour. How very differently had St
   Paul spoken before this of the temple of God full of the Holy Spirit.
   Then the vessels of dishonour, the vessels of wrath, had been the
   unbelieving Jews who were without. Even the sober, prosaic language of
   the pseudo-Paul reminds us of the great change which the lapse of time
   has brought about. St Matthew, too, has the same idea of the Church. He
   compares it to the field in which the tares grow up beside the wheat,
   or to the drag-net in which all manner of fish are caught. "Many are
   called but few are chosen." Then again, the Church is like a wedding
   feast, and some of the guests have no wedding dress. When the Lord
   appears they are cast out. In fact, there is only one comparison that
   we miss, that with Noah's ark. At any rate the later idea of the corpus
   mixtum is fairly started on its way by the writings of these two men.
   The evangelist John also gives expression to it when he sets forth the
   difference between the true and the false disciples in the last
   discourses of our Lord. There are branches on the vine which bear no
   fruit. These, men gather together and throw them into the fire and burn
   them. They alone are true Christians, who besides faith have love and
   keep the commandments. Soon after the Fourth Gospel there appeared at
   Rome the "Shepherd" of Hermas, a book whose main purpose was to shatter
   the false security in which many churchpeople were lulled to sleep. Let
   them beware: on the day of judgment whole masses of Christians were
   doomed to be lost. It is not enough to be called a Christian. That does
   not lead one into the kingdom of God. Only he who is strong in the
   strength of the Son of God and wears the robe of the Christian virtues
   dare hope for blessedness. And then he makes a list of all the nominal
   and worldly Christians, and passes judgment upon them. Here again we
   have true evangelistic thoughts. As often as they meet us we feel "here
   is the Spirit of Jesus," though, it is true, Hermas has no longer quite
   enough uncompromising moral earnestness to carry them to their logical
   conclusion. On one occasion he speaks of such as will not reach the
   Tower (the kingdom of God) because of their sins, but will only get as
   far as a much lower place, and that only when they have been tormented
   and have fulfilled the days of their sins. And this grace is accorded
   to them because they have a lot and share in the word righteous.' Here
   we have the germs of a doctrine, not, indeed, identically the same as,
   but at least very like, the later doctrine of purgatory. That doctrine
   is a compromise between the stern dualism of Jesus (either kingdom of
   God or hell) and the idea of the Church, which tries to bridge over
   this dualism for its members. We have not, of course, got as far as
   this in Hermas. He still up holds the sentence of condemnation;
   sinners, even though they be Christians, shall be burnt with fire just
   as the heathen. The only strange thing is that those Christians who had
   so sharp an eye for the defects of the Church never venture to draw the
   inference that the good prospers even outside of the Church and there
   wins God's favour. The Church shuts in their thoughts like a high wall.
   We must be content if within this high confining wall they are in
   earnest about the Gospel as far as they can consistently with the idea
   of the Church.

   We cannot be surprised to find that when once the Jewish idea of the
   Church had been taken over by the Christians, many other things
   followed in its track. A whole mass of Jewish customs and institutions
   were either directly borrowed or were imitated, so that there should be
   something in a Christian dress to replace them.

   The constitution of the Church was closely assimilated to the Jewish by
   the Old Testament foundation of the episcopal system. The first letter
   of St Clement, written at the end of the first century, sets up the
   sharp distinction between clergy and laity according to the standard of
   the Old Testament. Fortunately the parallel was incomplete, for the
   Christian priestly castes had no privileges derived from birth. But the
   sharp dividing line between the orders was to subsist and be respected
   under heavy penalties. The centralization, too, of the public worship
   in opposition to the many conventicles held by the Gnostics received
   Old Testament sanction. Clement writes: "Sacrifices are not offered
   everywhere, but only in Jerusalem, and there not in every place but in
   front of the temple on the altar, after that the sacrifice has been
   examined by the high priest and his ministers." Ignatius draws this
   conclusion: One altar, one bishop, one congregation of worshippers.
   Where the bishop appears there let the people be.

   The practice of paying the officials of the Church is also supported by
   Old Testament prescriptions regarding the support of the priests. In
   the Didache these dues are still paid to the prophets, "for they are
   your high priests." The revision of the Didache in the later apostolic
   constitutions substitutes priests' for prophets,' and this correction
   dates back to very early times.

   Jewish models again are followed in the development of the tradition
   and office of teacher. The Pastoral letters are the principal source of
   our evidence, although that combination of the episcopacy with the
   teaching office which it was the aim of these letters to further fell
   through. Jewish doctrine had been handed down both in written
   Scriptures and by oral tradition. It is to the Scriptures and tradition
   that the Christian now likewise appeals. In the first place, the Old
   Testament canon is saved from destruction in the struggle against the
   Gnostics, and receives recognition as the Word of God. Compared with it
   all Christian evidence, whether written or oral, is counted as
   tradition in the first instance. We begin to hear the watchwords,
   "Teaching of the Lord by the Twelve Apostles," "Teaching of the
   apostles most sacred faith," "The faith handed over to the saints." We
   shall see later how this faith was formulated. We are here concerned
   with the form. The pseudo-Paul speaks of the apostolic deposit
   (parakatathe'ke). It has been given by God to the apostle, and is to
   remain intact until the last day. This apostolic tradition is, of
   course, to be discovered above all in the old Christian writings, and
   is there secured most safely from corruption. St Clement (about 95 A.D.
   at Rome) is acquainted with letters of St Paul, the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, the Acts, the Synoptic Gospels; and Polycarp (about 120 A.D.
   at Smyrna) with the First Epistle of St John and the First of St Peter
   besides. The manner in which both writers, Polycarp as well as Clement,
   use other people's words as though they were their own without marks of
   quotation, shows us how intimate an acquaintance with Scripture is
   everywhere presupposed, even at this early date. By the side of this,
   however, oral tradition is counted as altogether inexhaustible. Papias,
   Bishop of Hierapolis, made especial use of it in his explanation of the
   sayings of Jesus. But this written and oral tradition was not allowed
   to develop without stint or stay. The safe keeping of the tradition was
   entrusted amongst the Jews to the succession of Rabbis, and in the
   Christian Church to the succession of bishops. Their office is simply
   to preserve and hand on faithfully that which they have received. All
   development, all progress, is prohibited. But for all their boasting of
   the doctrine once for all delivered to the saints, a constant process
   of evolution was at work amongst the Christians, just as it had been
   previously amongst the Jews.

   The public worship of the Church was also looked upon as an imitation
   of the Jewish. A letter like that to the Hebrews was bound to impel men
   to try and find the Jewish originals almost for every detail. They
   wished to see the pattern which Moses had seen on the mount when he
   wrote the law. St Clement of Rome is the first writer acquainted with
   the letter to the Hebrews, and he makes the application. The bishops
   are spoken of as "those who offer up the sacrifices"; the value of
   ceremonial observance and the heinousness of ceremonial offences is
   insisted upon. The metaphor of sacrifice must have been used from time
   immemorial in the Christian communities. First of all, they spoke of
   the sacrifice of Jesus, or the sacrifice of the heart. But soon prayers
   are offered up as sacrifices, and very soon, even in the Didache, the
   Lord's Supper is celebrated as a sacrifice. The old conceptions of
   ceremonial purity and sanctity reappear forthwith. The Greek mysteries
   here exercised, it is true, almost as great an influence upon the
   Christian Church as the Jewish synagogue. But all that is consciously
   continued is the public worship of the Old Testament.

   Sunday, the Lord's day, takes the place of the Sabbath, first in the
   Apocalypse, then in the letter of Pliny, and in most writings of the
   second century. This celebration of Sunday by the Christians instead of
   the Sabbath, is for Ignatius an important sign of the new religion.
   Jewish liturgies are used for divine service with short Christian
   additions. Hence the regular confession of sins. This Jewish origin
   likewise accounts for the fact that the name of God the Father occurs
   so seldom in the prayers of the congregation. The First Epistle of
   Clement, the Pastoral epistles, and probably the Didache as well,
   contain instances of Jewish prayers adapted for Christian use. But an
   earlier document--the Apocalypse--is full of Jewish liturgies. Just as
   in the synagogue, the service of prayer is followed by the reading of
   Scripture, by the sermon, and by a concluding prayer; for plainly the
   Acts, e.g., do not presuppose any other kind of service. The Lord's
   Prayer is regarded as the chief prayer for individual use; as such it
   is to take the place of the Jewish "eighteen prayer"; hence the command
   to use it three times daily. The doxology, too, which is attached to
   it, is of Jewish origin. Together with the prayers, the practice of
   fasting is taken over from the synagogue, the only change being that of
   the days. Instead of Mondays and Thursdays the Christian is to fast
   Wednesdays and Fridays, "so as to be distinguished," says the Didache,
   "from the hypocrites." The whole meaning of this ecclesiastical fasting
   is derived from the synagogue; it does not only imply humiliation in
   God's sight: it is also considered to be a means of obtaining special
   revelations.

   In addition to this the Jewish institution of penance is very widely
   used in the case of particular faults of individuals. St Paul had been
   the first to introduce it. In his case this was absolutely necessary,
   for as he looked upon all sinful Christians as elect in spite of their
   sin, the possibility of repentance had to be left open for them. The
   evangelist Matthew shows us that amongst Jewish Christians a kind of
   penance was in use which he refers back to Jesus Himself. It rests upon
   a number of Jewish presuppositions. The Apocalypse proves a similar
   institution to have existed in Asia Minor, and according to Clement and
   Hermas we find it at Rome. Clement tries to derive it from Christian
   sources. Jesus' blood is so precious in God's sight that it obtained
   the grace of repentance for the whole world. But he immediately reverts
   to Jewish thoughts. From one generation to another God gave the
   penitent room for repentance. Noah, Jonah, the prophets, all preached
   repentance. In the case of Hermas the Jewish conception of repentance
   follows almost of necessity from the sources which he used, for they
   attached an especial importance to right instruction as to repentance.
   Repentance is here regarded as a special divine favour. God grants it
   to one; He refuses it to another. The apostate and blasphemers of the
   Lord are alone excluded from it, as well as those that betray the
   servants of the Lord. For all other sinners there is a possibility of
   repentance, though with very varying chances of success. Repentance is
   essentially self-inflicted punishment. God does not at once pardon the
   penitent their sins. He that repents must inflict great torments upon
   himself and humiliate himself in all his ways, and pass through
   manifold tribulation. Abandonment of one's sin is, of course, an
   essential part of penitence, but as that is a duty anyhow, it is not
   enough. Works of supererogation are necessary for the right kind of
   penance and self-humiliation. Such are prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.
   So the Second Epistle of St Clement enumerates them as instruments of
   penance of varying efficacy. The conclusion was probably formed by a
   public confession of sins, followed by the absolution of the Church.

   There is no doubt that Jesus' call to repentance was not without
   influence in the introduction of the practice of penance; but the
   Jewish influence was by far the more powerful. This was the source of
   the uncertainty which began to be felt by the Christians as to the
   limits of repentance and forgiveness. There are deadly sins for which
   one dare not offer up a prayer for forgiveness. The First Epistle of St
   John emphasizes this point without mentioning the sins by name. Hermas
   enables us to obtain some idea of the conflicting opinions at Rome
   concerning repentance. The majority of the congregations appear to
   think that the possibility of repentance always remains open. On the
   other hand, Hermas heard some teachers profess the doctrine that there
   was no other repentance than that at baptism, the forgiveness
   consequent upon which related to previously committed sins alone. It is
   evident that Hermas subjected these two opinions to a careful
   examination, for what his vision reveals to him is practically a
   compromise between the two. It is first of all revealed to him that
   after a certain fixed day there is no more possibility of repentance
   for the righteous, but that the way is kept open for the Gentiles
   alone. Previously to this, however, a general indulgence is granted by
   God for all sins. Even those who denied the faith among the persecuted
   are pardoned. Later on Hermas converts this oracle, given to suit a
   certain definite time and place, into the general rule of the Church.
   Repentance is to take place once for all after baptism for every
   Christian. Hermas is guided in all this by the Jewish conception of
   penance, the needs of the Church, and inspiration, never by the
   teaching of Jesus.

   As time went on fresh loans were continually being made. The conclusion
   to which our study of eschatology and of angelology led us, applies
   here too. The influence of the Jewish Church increases the further we
   are removed from the time of Jesus. Jesus and His disciples, although
   born and bred Jews, are far less biassed by the Jewish ecclesiastical
   system than the later Christians, who only recognized the Jews as their
   declared enemies.

   One great advantage the early Christians derived from their constant
   contact with the Jewish Church. Opposed as they were by a religion
   resting upon an entirely historical basis, they were preserved from the
   danger of allowing their religion to be subtilized into a philosophy.
   The defence of Jesus and the controversy about the Old Testament
   guarded them against this peril. Whatever form He might assume, the God
   of the Christians remained a God of works and no philosophical
   abstraction: He was identified with Righteousness, and Hope looked
   forward expectantly to His works in the future. It was just the battle
   with the Gnostics that taught the Christians to value their great debt
   to Judaism.

   But setting aside this one advantage, the impression left by the
   anti-Jewish apologetic of the Christians is distinctly bad. It exhibits
   a finished skill in the explaining away of unpleasant facts or of
   perverting them, of inserting one's own opinions into the text instead
   of simply explaining it. The sense of truth amongst the Christians in
   the sub-apostolic age must have been very small indeed. No certain
   answer is given to the central question: "Wherein does the superiority
   of Christianity over Judaism consist?" St Mark gives the best answer in
   his picture of Jesus as the Son of God exalted far above all parties
   and authorities both in word and deed. But the true answer must surely
   contain more than this. It must show us that the Christians themselves
   and not only Jesus have been redeemed to a new and higher life. That
   was what St Paul had cried out in exultation for all the world to hear:
   "If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature." But since then
   we scarcely ever hear the answer in connection with apologetics; it is
   only in the parting discourses of Jesus to His disciples in the Fourth
   Gospel that we meet with any conception of the all-conquering power of
   the love of Christ. Everywhere else the tendency of apologetics with
   its false antitheses is to make St Paul's answer downright impossible.
   If Christ revealed the whole of the Old Testament, what was the new
   element, then, which He brought? If Christianity is the new law, how is
   its freedom and inwardness to be recognized? If a new Church has merely
   been substituted for the old without losing any of its
   self-consciousness and fanaticism, what meaning can still be given to
   redemption from the Church? The attempt to crush the new religion into
   the categories of the old, lost all the ground that had been won by the
   destruction of these very categories by the new faith.

   To these considerations we must add the by no means inconsiderable
   material influence of the Jewish Church, its piety, and ethics, and the
   invasion of Jewish literature and Jewish institutions. Politically
   Christianity becomes more opposed to the Jews than ever; the
   sequence--Paul, Luke, John and Barnabas--proves this. From a religious
   point of view, on the other hand, it makes advances to Judaism and
   succumbs to the constant pressure of its influence. Catholicism,
   especially Roman Catholicism, is, from our point of view, the Judaizing
   of Christianity. It is not without reason that the Reformation means a
   reawakening of St Paul, the opponent of the Jews.

CHAPTER VII.

  THE HEATHEN STATE AND THE HEATHEN RELIGION.

   IT was very fortunate for the new religion that through Jesus' words,
   "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the
   things that are God's," all revolutionary and zelotic projects of the
   Christians were nipped in the bud. As a Christian Pharisee St Paul had
   inculcated obedience to the powers that be as the will of God, and had
   held up the State to the Christians as God's ministry. This was before
   the beginning of the persecutions. After a short panic in Nero's reign
   the Christians had to endure the undisguised hostility of the State
   from the year 90 A.D. onwards. The persecution began in Asia Minor, the
   birthplace of the Apocalypse, and the place to which St Peter's first
   letter is addressed. The Apocalypse dates from the early years of the
   persecution. God's minister has been transformed into the minister of
   the dragon. Wild songs of triumph are now chanted by the Christians
   over the imminent fall of Rome, the great whore. To refuse to worship
   the emperor comes to be the sign of a Christian. Yet no word is uttered
   of revolution: the patient endurance of the saints, that is the watch
   word. And with that the author preserves his Christianity.

   The Christians now have to choose between one of two feelings: hatred
   of the State as the power of the devil--that is what the Apocalypse
   preaches--or resignation to God's will. He rules even through the
   emperor. Which is going to be the stronger?

   We must draw a clear distinction between the official position of the
   Christian writers and the feeling of many groups of laymen whose
   favourite book was the Apocalypse, and who shared the author's hatred
   against Rome. From time to time there is an altogether unpremeditated
   outburst of wrath against the tyrants, as in the case of Lucius, the
   Christian whose story Justin Martyr tells us. When he saw how Ptolemaus
   the teacher was condemned to death for no other crime than that of
   being a Christian, he broke out into reproaches against the prefect
   Urbicus who had passed the sentence, rebuking him for his unjust and
   unworthy behaviour. Being thereupon at once himself condemned to death,
   he cried out that he was very thankful to Urbicus. He knew that he was
   now quit of these bad masters of his, and was going to the Father and
   Lord of heaven. So, too, the Christian's longing for the end of the
   world--let grace begin, let the world perish--is to be interpreted as a
   heartfelt cry for delivery from the tyranny of the State. All the
   millenary expectations of the old Christians likewise presuppose
   hostility against the State. They look forward with eager expectation
   to the establishment of the kingdom of God upon earth in place of Rome.
   Meanwhile the Christian knows that his fatherland is in heaven. He is a
   stranger and a sojourner upon earth. The beginning of the first parable
   of Hermas is worth noting: "Ye know that ye live in a foreign land, ye
   servants of God, for your true city is far distant from this city." To
   hold opinions such as these in the midst of persecution was at least
   honest.

   The official attitude of many of the Christian authors is an entirely
   different one. From first to last it is obsequious. Christianity is to
   be a religio licita, like Judaism and in the place of Judaism, and that
   at any cost. Hence it makes advances to the State, and even assigns a
   fixed place to it in the liturgies borrowed from Judaism. The author of
   the First Epistle of St Peter is anxious to adapt St Paul's words as to
   the powers that be to the changed circumstances of his own time. In so
   doing he abandons the position that the State is the minister of God,
   as the State which persecutes the Christians cannot possibly be so
   called any longer. For the Lord's sake, however, it is to be obeyed.
   The fear of God and the honour due to the king are not mutually
   exclusive; only let each keep to its own place. As yet, faith in the
   calling of the State and the right to exercise protection is as strong
   as ever, and St Paul's words on the subject find ready credence.
   Besides, obedience to the governor is a duty incumbent on the
   Christians because of the malignant slanders that are current. They
   have got to prove that they are no anarchists. And yet this letter, in
   spite of its perfectly correct attitude to those in authority, claims
   to have been written in Babylon. Rome is Babylon, that is the author's
   secret meaning. And just like him, the author of the Pastoral epistles
   reminds his readers of the Pauline words, and explains them in the
   sense that they are to lead a tranquil and a quiet life, reviling no
   man, but kindly to all. The Lucan writings and the Johannine Gospel
   defend the Christians against the accusation of enmity to the State in
   the course of the narrative. The conceptions of Messiah and kingdom of
   God are explained in a nonpolitical sense. The kingdom of Christ is not
   of this world, as is proved by the pacific nature of the Christians.
   The kingdom of Jesus consists entirely in His testimony to the truth.
   And a proof of this is that when on one occasion the Jews wanted to
   crown Him king, He escaped from them by flight. Care is taken also to
   remove the reproach that the Christians refuse to pay taxes. It is
   proved that the Christians are the true Jews, and that the Jews lie
   with all their instigations. The trial of Jesus and the trial of St
   Paul are henceforward important subjects from an apologetic point of
   view. Pilate, Felix, and Festus have to appear as witnesses to the
   innocence of the accused. Above all, the whole plan of the book of the
   Acts furnishes the desired proof of the antiquity of Christianity.
   Christianity is nothing else than the old Jewish religion which is now
   spreading over Gentile countries.

   The First Epistle of St Clement is the first document to afford us an
   insight into the political element of the old Christian liturgies. Its
   great concluding prayer contains the first petition known to us for
   "all that are in authority upon earth; may God grant them health and
   wealth, and peace and concord." Again and again the statement is
   repeated that rulers derive their power from God. Even though it be
   older than the age of persecution--for presumably it is derived from
   Judaism--it was nevertheless commonly used in this age and so again
   forbade the Christians every kind of revolution. The author of the
   Pastoral epistles, and after him Polycarp, asks all the Christians to
   use this or a similar prayer. They are to pray for all men, for kings
   and all persons in authority, because it is only if peace and order be
   established in the State that the Christians will be able to practise
   their religion in tranquillity and quietness. As both of these authors
   write in a time of persecution, we may infer that it is the official
   attitude to the heathen world--one that is by no means a matter of
   course--that is here prescribed.

   It was only when it became evident that neither the Church's prayers
   for the emperor and the governor nor the Church's literature exercised
   any influence whatever upon the persecutors, that the Christian
   apologetic literature, properly so-called, took its rise. The prophet
   Quadratus was the first apologist. He dedicated his apology to the
   Emperor Hadrian. Next came the philosophers Aristides and Justin under
   Antoninus Pius. The only innovation consisted in the instrument that
   was now employed. The frankly apologetic attitude of the Church was not
   new, but several decades older. Many glaring inconsistencies were,
   however, the result of this policy. The liturgies were especially rich
   in contradictory passages. Prayers are prescribed for the health and
   wealth of those in authority, and at the same time, following the old
   Christian custom, for the end of the whole existing order of things. In
   his devotional treatise on prayer, Tertullian utters sentiments which
   are almost the exact contrary of what he says in his great Apology,
   which is addressed to the public in general. Justin protests the
   unpolitical character of the kingdom of God in his Apology, whereas in
   his Dialogue with Trypho, where the common Christian element is rather
   more evident, he longs for the establishment of the kingdom upon earth.
   Even John the evangelist, who as apologist eliminated as far as he
   could every eschatological element, eagerly looks forward in his first
   letter to the end of the world, when the State, whose servant Pilate
   was, shall disappear in the destruction of all things. At bottom there
   is a note of insincerity in the professions of friendship for the State
   on the part of all these apologists. It was their last resource. Open
   war prevailed between Church and State, and apologists like Justin died
   the death of heroes in this war. Their position is sufficient excuse
   for the contradiction in which they involved themselves. Their
   greatness lies in this, that when the decisive moment came they abjured
   the State and died like Polycarp with the confession, "Jesus is Lord,
   and not the emperor," upon their lips.

   The Heathen Religion.

   Its Jewish parentage in itself determined the position of Christianity
   towards all the popular religion of the Gentiles. Heathendom was all
   lies, darkness, and the service of the devil. Whilst the philosophical
   monotheism of the Greeks was combined as a rule with a certain feeling
   of reverence for the ancient gods who were conceived of as subordinate
   powers of the world spirit, Jewish monotheism was from the first
   characterized by exclusiveness and intolerance. In the long run,
   however, this proved to be fortunate for the new religion, which was
   thus preserved from dissolution in the universal fusion of religions.
   Unfortunately, our authorities for the impact of Christianity upon
   Paganism are extremely deficient. The Acts resting upon the theory that
   St Paul always began by preaching to the Jews, avoid almost every
   mention of the struggle in its early stages. But for all that, some of
   the episodes which it recounts are exceedingly instructive. We there
   become acquainted with the Christian missionaries as the workers of
   miracles, faith-healers, and exorcists, creating great excitement which
   ends, according to circumstances, either in apotheosis or in outbursts
   of rage. In Cyprus they have to contend with a magician, at Lystra they
   are taken for Zeus and Hermes because of the healing of a lame man. The
   priest is on the point of offering sacrifice to them when the matter is
   cleared up. At Philippi they cure a certain prophetess of her idle
   superstition, and thus depriving her masters of this source of income,
   are ill treated and imprisoned as a punishment. All these anecdotes are
   valuable as types. Only, instead of Paul and Barnabas and Silas, we
   must also from time to time picture to ourselves missionaries of an
   inferior type of character, men, in fact, who were little better than
   magicians or exorcists. But of direct public attacks upon the heathen
   religion we hear but little. Occasionally the Christian revivalist
   holds a public meeting in the open air. His object is to arouse the
   curiosity of his audience, he interlards his sermon with copious
   quotations from poets and philosophers, and in return for all his pains
   he will very probably be ridiculed by some passing philosopher, as Paul
   was at Athens. The most vivid picture of all is that given us of the
   riot of the silversmiths at Ephesus under Demetrius. The silversmiths
   have begun to notice that the sale of the little shrines of Artemis is
   decreasing, because the preaching of the Christian missionary robs them
   of their sanctity. So they flock together and cause no little commotion
   throughout the whole city of Ephesus by their cry, "Great is Diana of
   the Ephesians." Here at last we have one clear point, where
   Christianity attacks the social system of the ancient heathen world. It
   was at Ephesus, too, where the Christians burnt all their books of
   magic, the charms called "Ephesian letters," on a great pile, and
   boasted that the value of these idolatrous objects amounted to 50,000
   drachmas--an act which might likewise easily give rise to serious
   collisions. But when we have enumerated these few instances we have
   exhausted all the material that is of any value in the book of the
   Acts. The apocryphal stories of the apostles elaborate these themes,
   but in a grotesque and tasteless fashion corresponding to the taste of
   the later age from which they date. It is only with Tertullian, at the
   end of the second century, that we obtain a very complete insight into
   the countless problems and conflicts produced by the collision of the
   hostile religions.

   On the other hand, we have a mass of Christian apologetic literature in
   which the attempt was made to enter into the feelings of the Greeks and
   to adapt the new faith as far as possible to meet their needs. The
   earliest evangelist, Mark, wrote his Gospel for converts from
   heathendom, and with this object in view, very largely effaced the
   Jewish colouring of his tradition. Next follow in succession the Lucan
   writings, the Fourth Gospel, the preaching of St Peter, and finally the
   whole of the official apologetic literature. From these writings we
   derive a fairly good picture, not only of the struggle against the
   heathen religions, but also of the preaching of Christianity itself.
   But at the same time we see that Christianity does not only give but
   likewise receives, and that the defence of the Church is one of the
   strongest impulses that make for the process of Hellenization.

   The attack upon the old gods keeps entirely to the lines laid down by
   the Jews and the Greeks themselves. Nowhere do we find any trace of
   original thoughts. We are here concerned with three theories of
   religion.

   1. Under the influence of Judaism the Christians apply a coarsely
   materialistic theory to the Greek religion. The Jew only believes what
   he sees. The pictures are made by hands, the sacred animals are just
   animals, the sacred trees, wood, the sacred stones, stones and nothing
   else. But surely it is the height of folly to worship mere natural
   objects or the works of human art. This pitiful theory, by which it is
   just the religious element which is hidden away out of sight--i.e., the
   divinity that was supposed to reside in the objects--was the one that
   prevailed amongst Christian laymen. It can be traced back to St Paul
   and thence to its Jewish source, the wisdom of Solomon. St Peter's
   preaching knows no other. Even Aristides, who had been taught better
   things by the philosophers, follows it, at least when he is examining
   barbarian religions. Where this theory prevails we may safely assume
   Jewish culture.

   2. The Christians borrowed another, a rationalistic, theory of religion
   from the philosophers. It is known as Euhemerism. A very cursory
   examination is sufficient to show, of course, that the pictures and God
   are not the same, that the picture has been consecrated to God. But the
   gods appear, and this, especially in the Homeric poems, as over-men, of
   whose birth, suffering, and death we are often told. The objects of
   this worship were therefore the mighty men of old. This theory we meet
   with first of all in Aristides. He came across it in some Greek
   text-book.

   3. The most important theory practically was that of the demons, in
   which both Jews and Greeks agreed, the only difference being that the
   Greeks conceived the demons to be demi-gods of a neutral character,
   while the Jews looked upon them as evil spirits. The Jewish theory of
   demons recognizes the reality of the heathen religion and its outward
   effects, but explains them as a great temptation to lead men away from
   God. The starting-point is always the fact of prophecy and of miracles.
   Hence the whole world is looked upon as a great kingdom of demons,
   while the heathen ritual is merely one favourite province thereof. This
   was the only theory that practically governed men in their every-day
   relations. St Paul was already acquainted with it. It was based upon
   the Greek Bible The hall-mark of Christianity was the knowledge that
   only demons, and not true gods, were the creators of Paganism, and that
   Christ has freed us from them. He freed us when He was upon earth by
   repeatedly casting out devils. He still frees us by means of exorcisms.
   That is why the name of Jesus is uttered over the convert at baptism,
   in order that He may cast the devils out of us.

   The question now was how to set up the new Christian God in the place
   of the fallen heathen divinities. In their establishment of monotheism,
   the Christians, from the very first, simply followed in the lines laid
   down by the philosophers as soon as they attempted to produce any
   arguments beyond those furnished by the Old Testament. This subject
   rather belongs, therefore, to our next chapter, in which we are to
   consider the general influence of philosophy upon the Christians. The
   defence of Jesus, on the other hand, entirely enters into the
   conceptions of the popular religion. Jesus Christ is opposed to the old
   gods as the new and stronger God. That is the meaning of the "Divinity
   of Christ." The idea arose amongst the heathen, and must be conceived
   of in antithesis to the heathen gods.

   One thing we must grasp clearly. The notion is as little Jewish as it
   possibly can be. The Jews simply have no room for a second being called
   God in the strict sense of the word. "The alone true God," "The only
   God," as John and Clement call Him, that is Jewish. The Messiah is a
   man chosen or sent by God hence in any case a created being. Therefore
   the strict Jewish Christianity, and Mohammedanism, which is based upon
   it, have always entirely excluded this thought. It is true that the
   Jew, Paul, goes a long way beyond the humanity of Jesus when he
   discovers Him from time to time in the Lord of the Old Testament, and
   says that the fulness of the God head dwells in Him. But, firstly, he
   never calls Him God himself, and he shows us in his chief
   eschatological chapter how strongly he clings to monotheism. Secondly,
   he is anything rather than a Jew in his Christological exegesis of the
   Old Testament. Here he leaves all Jewish tradition on one side and
   gives free vent to his mythological vein: whence he derives it would be
   hard to tell. No road leads up to the doctrine of the divinity of
   Christ from the Old Testament and from Rabbinism.

   But amongst the heathen, apotheosis was exceedingly common. The number
   of their deities is not limited, and they range by the most varied
   series of degrees imaginable down to the hero who is deified. The
   characteristic signs of a god are always considered to be great power,
   miracles, and prophecy. For the Jews a miracle proves the truth of a
   doctrine, for the Gentiles it denotes the presence of a god on earth.
   Hence St Paul was twice taken to be a god, at Lystra and at Malta,
   because of the miracles that he performed. So, too, the Roman centurion
   exclaims beneath the Cross, "This was a Son of God!" because of the
   miracles which accompanied the death of Jesus. The Jewish word "Son of
   God" has, by itself, the sound of hero or demi-god in Greek ears.

   And so as soon as it came to the Greeks, accompanying the pictures of
   the great worker of miracles, over whom death had no dominion, faith in
   the divinity of Christ arose at once. It is the original faith of the
   Gentile Christians. Christological dogma did not grow by slow
   additions, but, on the contrary, by the Jewish and antagonistic
   subtraction from this popular belief. The Gentile Christian immediately
   gives Jesus a place in his worship. He sings his "carmen Christo quasi
   deo." The apocryphal Acts of the Apostles are the clearest authority
   that we possess for this popular belief! Throughout these writings the
   new God Christ is contrasted with the heathen gods. It matters not
   whether He is called God or Son of God.

   Partly consciously, and partly unconsciously, the Christian apologetic
   accommodated itself to this faith from a very early date. The first
   condition for this was the transformation of the picture contained in
   the Gospels in a universalistic sense. Paul had already ascribed to
   Jesus' death an atoning power for the whole world. And now the whole
   world must be described as the object of the affections of the living
   Jesus of the Gospels. This was effected first of all by simply
   supplementing the national Jewish activity of Jesus by the command to
   go and preach to all people, which was ascribed to the risen Lord. That
   is the procedure adopted by our three Synoptists, in all of whom a
   certain hiatus is noticeable between the real history and the theory.
   Next, John paints his picture without any concern for the actual
   history. It begins with the Logos, the mediator both for creation and
   revelation to the whole world, and throughout proclaims Jesus to be the
   Saviour of the world, while it reaches its height in the scene when the
   Greeks come to Jesus and Jesus declares how He, being lifted up from
   the earth, will draw all men to Himself. This proclamation of
   universalism was necessary in order that the Greeks might be able to
   say "The new God did not come for the Jews in a little corner of Syria,
   but for the world, and for us."

   In the next place, Jesus had to be proved a stronger God than the
   demons. St Mark's Gospel undertakes this proof by presenting Jesus to
   all the world as the Son of God, the worker of miracles, the conqueror
   of the demons, and the prophet. Hence the important position here
   assigned to miracles, and amongst the miracles, especially to the
   victory over the demons. The empire of Satan is at an end. Legions of
   demons fall into the sea. Jesus is Lord over nature. He stills the
   storm. He makes the sea to be firm land. His power knows no limits,
   Mark naturally did not picture all this to himself after the same
   heathen fashion in which it must have worked upon his readers.

   Soon after this (by analogy with other myths of the gods) the parentage
   of the Son of God is ascribed to God and a mortal woman. Such is the
   account in the opening chapters of the First and Third Gospels. The
   myth sprang up amongst Gentile Christians. A great proportion of the
   old Jewish Christians rejected it, and rightly, for it did away with
   the descent from David, which was a matter of such importance to them.
   The Christian spirit has, to be sure, been at work at this myth, and
   has removed from it every trace of sensuality and anthropomorphism. It
   is not God Himself but God's Holy Spirit who begets Jesus. But even as
   early as Justin the analogy had been discovered: "When we say that He
   was born of a virgin, you may consider that as something which He
   shares with Perseus." Celsus, the adversary of the Christians, finds
   still further analogies in Amphion, Aeacus and Minos, which examples he
   puts into the mouth of the Jew who appears as the opponent of the
   Christians. It is not for nothing that the story of the miraculous
   conception became so popular among the Gentile Christians: God's Son is
   He whose Father is God and no man.

   The Christology of the Fourth Gospel has, it is true, borrowed the idea
   of the Logos from philosophy. Besides this, consideration for the
   feelings of the Jews leads the author to emphasize the subordination of
   Christ to God. But concealed beneath the philosophy and the anti-Jewish
   apologetic, the popular belief in the new God that has appeared upon
   earth can be discovered in all its power. The miracles of Jesus--all of
   them the miracles of an omnipotent deity--are conceived of as a proof
   of the Messiahship for the Jews, and for the Greeks as a revelation of
   the Godhead. When Thomas sees the crucified Saviour with the stigmata
   risen from the dead, he cries out, as any Gentile might, "My Lord and
   my God!" And the evangelist would like to bring all people to make this
   same confession. All men should honour the Son as they honour the
   Father, i.e., just as God, and such is the will of the Father Himself.
   Then there is the mantic art, second sight and prophecy, which, next to
   the miracles, are a proof of the divinity. Like a God, Jesus looks into
   the hearts of all men, so that no man needed to tell Him what there was
   in man. He knows all the past history of the Samaritan woman with whom
   He talks, and knows from the very first that Judas is destined to
   betray Him. If He asks it is only to test those whom He questions. No
   god has a clearer insight. Neither need He eat or drink. His food is
   obedience to the Divine Will. If He asks for water to drink, then the
   want is but apparent, and the request is really made to introduce the
   conversation. Even if He prays it is but for the sake of those that
   hear and not for Himself. He has conquered death. Heaven is His home:
   thence He came; thither He shall go. Throughout His sayings it is the
   God that has descended from heaven that we hear speaking. Hence, too,
   He is at once introduced as a God in the prologue to the Gospel. Thus
   it is that the evangelist writes for the Greeks. His successor herein
   is the author of the apocryphal Acts of St John, where the hints of the
   author of the Fourth Gospel are exaggerated in an absurd and fantastic
   manner. So, for instance, he says that often when one followed after
   Jesus as He walked along He left no footprints behind Him. As one felt
   His body it would be at one time quite impalpable, so that one's hand
   simply passed through it, and at another hard. It is not merely because
   of a higher canon of taste that the evangelist omits features such as
   these, which entirely destroy the humanity of Jesus. He himself, as
   opponent of the Gnostic Docetae, is thoroughly in earnest in his belief
   in the incarnation of the Logos. And yet, is his Jesus much else than a
   phantom? He needs neither to eat nor to pray, nor to ask for
   information, nor to die. Even in his own case the popular docetic
   belief and the anti-docetic theory are balanced against each other.

   Prophecy and miracles together formed the proof of the divinity of
   Christ. For John is just as far removed from an ethical conception of
   the divinity of Christ as the whole of the rest of Christian antiquity
   after him. The doing of God's will, to whatever degree of perfection
   one may attain, is still something human. It is man's duty. It is at
   most important for St John in so far as a sinful man can not be God's
   instrument. Indeed, the ethical conception of Christ's divinity only
   came to be entertained when men began to find miracles a
   stumbling-block, and were yet loth to abandon the title of God. For St
   John God is the highest hyperphysical force. Consequently a human being
   upon earth can only prove himself to be divine by manifestations of
   this force. It was not because he felt the impression of Christ's moral
   splendour, but because he marvelled at the conquest of death by life,
   that St Thomas uttered the exclamation, "My God!" It is not because of
   His moral supremacy that all men are to honour the Son as God, but
   because He does His Father's work, because He raises the dead and comes
   to judge the world. So, too, the Son's unity with the Father is not
   merely the unity of a loving will, but the unity of power. No demon can
   take those that are His out of His hand, for otherwise he would have to
   be more powerful than God Himself, who is Lord of all. He that hath
   seen the Son seeth the Father, because the Son does the Father's mighty
   works. This same divine, miraculous power is to do still greater works
   through the disciples, but not in order that they too may appear as
   bearers of the Divinity, but in order that the Father may be glorified
   in the Son, in honour of the divinity of Christ, in whose name these
   wonderful works are done by the disciples. In appealing, therefore, to
   the miracles, and the miracles alone, as the proof of Christ's
   divinity, all later apologists faithfully follow the example of St
   John.

   The greatest obstacle to belief in Jesus' divinity was His death, just
   as it seemed impossible to harmonize it with His claim to the
   Messiahship. Hence the frequent recurrence to this subject in the
   anti-Jewish apologetic. Justin did, it is true, find analogies for the
   death, too, in Greek mythology. There was Asclepius struck by
   lightning, Dionysus dismembered, Heracles burnt on the funeral pyre,
   and all these were worshipped as gods or the sons of God. This clever
   discovery had, however, not been made by the earlier apologists. They
   strained every nerve to harmonize the death of Jesus with His divinity.
   They succeeded in doing so by adopting the same method as in the
   anti-Jewish apologetic, by a brilliant description of the Resurrection,
   by multiplying the miracles and the instances of fulfilled prophecies
   in the story of the Passion, by emphasizing the voluntariness of the
   death. Many Gentile Christians would have preferred to have denied the
   death of Jesus altogether. His death was only outwardly apparent.
   According to the Acts of St John it is only for the populace that He is
   crucified, while at the same time He appears to His disciples in glory.
   But this consequence of the "divinity of Christ" was at once
   indignantly rejected as a Gnostic error. We may account for the
   moderate position adopted by the Christian apologists with reference to
   the death of Jesus as a reaction against this extreme exaggeration.

   Whilst the other apologists were satisfied with proving the physical
   superiority of Jesus over the old gods, the Fourth Gospel alone
   attempted to give a clear answer to the question what gifts God had
   brought men down from heaven. His answer was shaped to meet the needs
   of the Greek world. Chiefest of all the gifts was that of truth or
   knowledge, light, illumination. Such conceptions were current even
   amongst the Jewish proselytes. This, too, is when we find mention of
   the opposites, light and darkness, truth and lies, knowledge and
   ignorance. With these conceptions John as well as the Jews would
   describe monotheism--the worship of the only true God--and the
   knowledge of the lies of the demons. The only thing which is both novel
   and great is the way in which these privileges are here conceived of as
   gifts of God through Christ. Whilst in many other apologists monotheism
   and faith in Christ lie side by side without any apparent connection,
   the Fourth Gospel laid a great Christo-centric foundation for the whole
   faith in God, and strongly emphasized St Paul's statement that the God
   and Father of Jesus Christ is the alone true God.

   The next great gift which Christ brought the Greeks from heaven was
   everlasting life, i.e., immortality, or rather the present assurance of
   the certain possession of the same. That, too, was a great source of
   comfort for the Greeks, facing the future as they did with such
   hesitation, scepticism, and fear. The tangible proof was furnished by
   the resurrection of Jesus and by the preceding raising of Lazarus from
   the dead.

   It was only amongst the Gnostics that the pure doctrine of the divinity
   of Christ was maintained. In the Church it was counted as a heresy just
   because of the Gnostics and with deference to the accusations of the
   Jews. This popular belief, however, in the appearance of the new god
   constitutes the kernel of the new Christology. A striking proof of this
   assertion is furnished by Ignatius' letter to the Ephesians. The
   virginity of Mary and her birth and the death of the Lord remained
   concealed from the Prince of this world. They were three mysteries
   which spoke aloud in the stillness of God. How, then, were they
   revealed to the ages? A star appeared in the heavens brighter than all
   other stars, and the light thereof was inexpressibly great, and its
   strangeness spread consternation. But all the other stars, together
   with the sun and the moon, formed a circle round this star, yet its
   light exceeded the light of all the others. And the hearts of men
   failed them, for they could not tell whence this strange star appeared
   unto them. Henceforth all magic was at an end and all the bonds of
   wickedness were snapped asunder. Ignorance was dethroned, the old reign
   was no more, now that God Incarnate had come to give men the newness of
   everlasting life. Nowhere, even in the New Testament, is the
   significance of Christ for the downfall of Paganism formulated as
   clearly as here.

   The question now presents itself, How was Christianity related to the
   religion of the mysteries? There were likely to be several points of
   agreement. Both tended to fix the attention on the world to come, to
   attach importance to holy rites and moral purity, and to seek happiness
   in the common life. Did not this imply so close an inner relationship
   that the outer forms were bound to be exchanged mutually?

   From the very first the Gospel courted publicity and claimed to be a
   message intended for the light of common day. A city set upon a hill
   cannot be hid. The candle is not intended to be placed under the bushel
   but on the candlestick. Even though we begin with whispering in the ear
   and speaking in the chamber, yet the end clearly aimed at is to preach
   on the roof and in the public streets. And just as the Gospel courts
   publicity, so its scope is universal. Why, it is the exact opposite of
   everything that is exclusive. It abolishes the privileges of the
   learned and throws its doors wide open to the simple layman. There is
   nothing esoteric in the preaching of Jesus from first to last. It is
   one of the great and comforting features in His character that the love
   of mystery and aristocratic self-sufficiency are alike alien to Him.
   Hence Christianity and the mysteries are mutually exclusive.

   So, too, the aim of the disciples of Jesus and of St Paul was not to
   found a sect, but to gather together and to increase the people of God.
   By their choice of the Old Testament as their sacred book they declared
   their intention of remaining faithful to the public religion. Their
   adoption of the name Church' points in the same direction. For the
   Church is something public, something which embraces all men alike in
   opposition to every private society. The enthusiastic manner in which
   the earliest Christian apologists defended this public character of
   Christianity in opposition to all secret sectarianism is very
   admirable. The author of the Acts never wearies in his attempt to prove
   that the Christians are merely the true people of Israel. That is why
   he insists on the fact that the original apostles and St Paul never
   abandoned the old sanctuary, the Temple, but assembled there in the
   sight of all men and praised God. So Paul can declare when he is
   brought to trial, "These things have not been done in a corner." The
   author of the Fourth Gospel emphasizes the public character of
   Christianity still more strongly. The founder is the Logos, the light
   of the world. When a Jewish Rabbi once visited Him secretly at night He
   concluded His conversation with him by the saying as to the light. That
   is why He appears so frequently in Jerusalem and in the Temple, that
   all the world may see. "I have spoken openly to all the world; in
   secret have I said nothing." When brought to trial He appeals to this;
   and as the Lord's Supper was commonly calumniated amongst the Gentiles
   as a secret rite defiled by horrible orgies, immorality, and
   cannibalism, by analogy of much that was ascribed to many mysteries,
   Jesus is described by the evangelist as delivering a spiritual
   exposition of the Sacrament in public at Capernaum, and thus he refutes
   the slanderous accusations. St John is followed by Justin in the two
   Apologies. His method is to set forth all the Christian doctrines and
   customs without the slightest reserve, and so he takes the sting out of
   the heathen attack: "Study our religion; then you will convince
   yourselves how little reason we have for shunning the light." It may
   evidently be inferred from this method of Church defence that in the
   eyes of the Christian teachers themselves their religion was perfectly
   separate and distinct from the mysteries.

   But for all that there was an inner resemblance between the two. In the
   first place, the persecution of the national Jewish Church and
   afterwards of the Roman Government actually forced the Christians to
   live, so to speak, underground in the dark and in mystery. Even the
   Fourth Gospel speaks of a meeting with closed doors for fear of the
   Jews. By positively refusing to acknowledge the public character of the
   Christian religion, the State itself made of Christianity a sect that
   shunned the light. Besides this external reason, however, there was a
   second, due to the essential character of the original society.
   Christianity was at first organized as an exclusive community. Hence
   its strength. It was only within these narrow limits that the teaching
   of Jesus could be realized. But as such a community it only possessed a
   limited public character. The sacrament of baptism formed a sharp
   dividing line between members and non-members. It was itself a
   sectarian form borrowed from the sect of the disciples of the Baptist.
   The Lord's Supper was only intended for the brethren, and the same
   remark applies to several other rites and customs, e.g., the public
   confession, the kiss of brotherhood, etc. Now as Christianity spread
   under the form of this organization and thus became known to the Greeks
   and Romans, it could only appear to them to be a sect, and they then
   judged it like many other sects which shunned the light, and that with
   good reason.

   As a matter of fact a contradiction existed between the claim of
   Christianity to be the world religion and its sectarian form, its rites
   and ceremonies adapted only to a small society. We are conscious of
   this contradiction even at the present day as soon as we ask ourselves
   what place the sacraments really occupy in our national and established
   Churches.

   As a result of the confusion caused by the rise of Gnosticism,
   numberless small sects appear by the side of the one sect, which still
   upheld its claim to be the Church. Prolonging, as nearly all of them
   did, a precarious existence in almost greater obscurity than the
   Church, they were the first to fall irrevocably under the influence of
   the mysteries, because from the very beginning they cultivated an
   exclusive aristocratic spirit and an esoteric doctrine. In opposition
   to this tendency the belief in the universal scope of Christ's message
   and its public character was the more firmly rooted, and once again
   this was exceedingly fortunate for the Church.

   Ecclesiastical Christianity won the victory over Gnosticism, but not
   without submitting to the influence of the mysteries. Without
   themselves being conscious of it, the Christian teachers adapted
   themselves in many points to the opinions of their opponents in the
   course of their controversies and defence of the Church. It is in the
   development of the idea of the sacraments that we have the strongest
   evidence of the influence of the mysteries.

   The essential characteristic of the mysteries was, of course, inherent
   in the sacraments from the very first. Simple human actions are
   invested with mysterious attributes. They can exorcise evil spirits,
   become the channels of divine power, bring men into communion with the
   Lord on high. These opinions cannot be derived from the teaching of
   Jesus; they show us how Christianity in its infancy was drawn into the
   chaos of Oriental religions. Paul, apostle though he was of the spirit
   and the word, nevertheless found a place in his great theological
   system for the sacred rites of the first Christian community as means
   of salvation. For him, too, they are the definite points where Christ
   or His Spirit impart themselves to the community and to the individual,
   in order to lift them up to themselves. Baptism is incorporation into
   the body of Christ, the Lord's Supper the continued support from the
   supply of His strength. This conception, however mysterious, still
   retained the Christian thought that our present salvation depends upon
   the person of Christ. And besides this, it was effectively balanced by
   the preponderant ethical note in the apostle's teaching and character,
   which enabled him to draw moral imperatives even from the sacraments.

   In the sub-apostolic age, belief in sacramental efficacy grows in
   proportion to the rapidity with which Christianity takes root in
   heathen soil. There, among the Greeks and in contact with the thoughts
   disseminated by the mysteries, the unseen world comes to dominate
   everywhere as the only true reality, filling the whole foreground of
   life, and baptism and the Lord's Supper are subordinated to it as
   mysterious initiatory rites, while at the same time the sacramental
   apparatus becomes evermore and more complicated through competition
   with other sacraments.

   The original simplicity of baptism, washing in running water and
   utterance of the name of Jesus, no longer sufficed. The laying on of
   hands was added. This addition alone, so the author of the Acts tells
   us, afforded a channel for the descent of the Holy Ghost. It was the
   prerogative of the apostles--later, of the bishops. Somewhat later
   appeared the anointing with consecrated oil. If the First Epistle of St
   John knows the name we may conclude that the thing, too, existed either
   among Catholic Christians or Gnostics. Possibly the name Christ, the
   anointed, facilitated the reception of this rite. Ignatius refers to
   the anointing of Christ in Bethany, and thence derives the custom. It
   was, at all events, long before the time of Tertullian (to whom we owe
   our first treatise on baptism), possibly a century earlier, that the
   sacrament consisted of three separate ceremonial parts--immersion,
   unction, imposition of hands. We really have three sacraments united in
   one, or rather there are four, since the utterance of the name of Jesus
   has itself the efficacy of a sacrament. At the beginning of the second
   century baptism into the name of Jesus began to give way to baptism
   into the name of the Trinity, the latter practice being founded on the
   passage in St Matthew's Gospel which traced the formula back to Jesus
   Himself. But it was an innovation, for we see from the Acts that the
   apostles and St Paul only baptized into the name of Jesus. How and
   where the phrase arose we cannot tell, but we are acquainted with a
   transition stage. The author of the Apocalypse knows of such as have
   the name of the Lamb and of the Father written on their forehead. To
   others he promises that they shall be pillars in the temple of God, and
   upon them shall be written the name of God and the name of the new
   Jerusalem and the name of mankind. We may here learn something of the
   motives which led to the growth and final victory of the Trinitarian
   formula. It was produced by no doctrinal theory, but by the need that
   men felt to be quite on the safe side through the employment of yet
   more powerful names. From the very first, forgiveness of previous sins
   and the pouring forth of God's Spirit were regarded as the gifts
   obtained by means of baptism. Hence it was called "birth of
   regeneration," "renewing of the Holy Spirit," "birth from above by
   water and the Spirit." New designations, illumination' and seal,' came
   to be added to these, the oldest, Christian names. Both were probably
   derived from the phraseology of the mysteries. Through wonderful
   illumination the convert steps forth from the kingdom of darkness and
   ignorance into the kingdom of light and of knowledge. Without actually
   naming baptism, Clement describes this solemn moment. Through Christ
   the eyes of our heart were opened. Through Him our ignorant and
   darkened understanding climbed the steep ascent into His wonderful
   light. Through Him the Lord wanted us to taste of the knowledge that
   perisheth not. Hence Justin speaks of a birth of repentance and of
   knowledge. We are breathing the air of the Greek mysteries. The
   expression seal' implies protection against the demons and initiation
   into the world to come. Long before this Paul speaks of Christians as
   anointed, sealed, having the earnest of the Spirit. In the Apocalypse
   the one hundred and forty-four thousand Israelites are sealed in order
   that they may come safely through all temptations and plagues and reach
   the kingdom of heaven. We cannot be quite sure what the author meant by
   this sealing. Most probably, however, he pictured to himself that the
   name of God or of Jesus which exorcised the evil spirits was engraved
   upon the foreheads of the faithful. And now baptism itself was regarded
   as such a protective measure--the holy name being pronounced as well.
   Its efficacy can, of course, be completely destroyed or impaired;
   denial of the faith in time of persecution, grievous sins of the flesh,
   stain it; but wherever it is kept untainted it is a mighty protection
   against all demons and a guarantee of everlasting life. When Hermas
   declares that even those who died before Christ came and are now in
   Hades must receive the seal--the seal, he adds, is the water--since
   without this none can enter into the kingdom of heaven, he is looking
   upon baptism as the rite of initiation which alone confers upon men the
   blessedness of the world to come. Faith alone no longer suffices. The
   magic power of the sacrament is needed besides. In like manner, too,
   the Lord's Supper comes to be looked upon as food and drink for this
   life. "He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath everlasting
   life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is meat
   indeed and My blood is drink indeed." Such are the words which the
   evangelist John puts into the mouth of Jesus, and he can only mean that
   the elements received in the Lord's Supper create the spiritual, the
   resurrection body of the Christian. His successor Ignatius says, with
   perfect outspokenness, the Lord's Supper is the magic rite whereby we
   obtain immortality: it is the medicine which prevents our death and
   secures our perpetual life in Jesus Christ. Then there follows in
   Justin the first attempt at explaining this change of the body and
   blood of Christ into our own body, and the apologist reminds us at the
   same time of the analogy presented by the mysteries of Mithras, where,
   in like manner, bread and a cup of water are presented and certain
   invocations used when anyone is to be initiated. Naturally it is only
   the initiated who can fully participate in this mysterious food. "Let
   him that is holy draw near, and if anyone be not holy then let him
   repent." The saying of Jesus, "Give not that which is holy to the
   dogs," is applied in the Didache to the Lord's Supper.

   We have traced the first steps of that fateful development which, under
   the influence of Greek and Oriental mysteries, made of Christianity a
   religion of superstition and of magic charms. True, there is no lack of
   Christian teachers in our period, just as little as there was in later
   periods, who, when they speak of the sacraments, immediately treat them
   as symbols and the means of inculcating moral truth, whose end and aim
   is the grace of God and spiritual communion with the Redeemer through
   these outer magical media. But in interpreting the sacraments after
   their own fashion, these teachers give the Christian people the right
   to do so after theirs--i.e., to look upon them as magic rites. The only
   really valid argument that can be advanced in favour of the sacraments
   is surely this. No religious community could continue to
   exist--certainly not in the age of the mysteries--without some such
   outer signs intended to excite the feelings and to inflame the fancy.
   Had Christianity not possessed baptism and the Lord's Supper from the
   very first, it would have derived its sacraments from some other
   source. In any case the purely ethical and personal religion was bound
   to degenerate. For here there is but one alternative. One thing is
   needful: either the condition of the heart or the reception of the
   sacred rite. When the very smallest importance is attached to the
   reception of the rite, there the Gospel, with its three great
   realities, the soul, the brethren, and God, is destroyed.

   In eschatology, too, we can trace the beginnings of a further
   development destined to be of great consequence. Eschatology lost its
   abhorrence of the Greek idea of the future world and assimilated thence
   all that it possibly could. It is true that we have come to the time
   when the flood of the Jewish Apocalyptic conceptions swept over the
   young religion with their gigantic and fantastic imagery more than ever
   before. The eschatology of most of the Christian congregations has
   still more of a Jewish than a Greek appearance. The expectation of the
   kingdom of God upon earth and of the resurrection of the dead--i.e.,
   the two thoughts which are least Greek in character--still stand in the
   centre of the Christian hope. Even so educated a Christian as Justin is
   a convinced millenarian. And yet the process of Hellenization set in
   about the end of the century, and it is this same Justin who is our
   witness for it.

   The process really begins in the Third Gospel, where Jesus' parable of
   the rich man and Lazarus, which is certainly genuine, is reproduced in
   Greek terminology. That is where we first hear of Hades, the Greek
   world of the departed. It seems to consist of two divisions, separated
   from each other by a great chasm: there is the place of rest, where
   Abraham and his children are comforted, and there is the place of
   torment, where sinners do everlasting penance in flames. If St Luke had
   given names, then he would have spoken of Gehenna and of Paradise. But
   since when are there two divisions of Hades? The evangelist has melted
   into one Gehenna and Tartarus, Paradise and Elysium, hence his
   wonderful topography. He was not the first to do this. We find Gehenna
   and Tartarus used indiscriminately in monumental inscriptions and in
   the Sibylline oracles. As soon as a Jew or a Christian living amongst
   Greeks began to reflect upon the fate of the soul after death, the
   well-known pictures of bliss and torment, which Greek prophets, poets,
   and philosophers--especially those of the Orphic school--had scattered
   broadcast among the people, filled his shadowy Sheol.

   It was especially the Greek ideas of hell which found a very early
   entrance into Christian eschatology. The most celebrated instance of
   this is in the Apocalypse of St Peter. There we read of the dark place
   of torment, of the different classes of sinners, and of the
   punishments, each undergone in an appointed place, of the torturing
   angels, and so forth. All these fancies are of Orphic origin, and they
   can be paralleled by passages from Virgil, Plutarch, and Lucian; but
   they have all come to us through a Jewish-Christian medium, and thence
   received their last expression, both from a linguistic as well as from
   a theological point of view. It is in any case a comfort to think that
   these very conceptions of hell for which Christianity has been
   condemned, severely enough, are of Greek origin. Justin, too, had been
   struck by the likeness between the Greek eschatology and that accepted
   by the Church in his time. He reminds us of the teaching of Empedocles,
   Pythagoras, Plato, and Socrates, of the pit in Homer, and of the
   descent of Odysseus into the nether world, and of all who wrote on
   similar subjects. The only difference between the Christians and the
   Greeks was that in place of Minos and Rhadamanthus Christ judged the
   dead, and that not only the soul but also the body was punished, and
   that forever. The Greek names which Justin enumerates are the
   representatives of this Orphic eschatology, and Homer's account of
   Hades is our earliest authority for the same. All of which furnishes us
   with an additional proof of the real connection between the two
   eschatologies.

   A considerable difference subsisted, it is true, between the two views
   as to the time when the sentence was to be passed. According to the
   Greeks it was at death, but according to the Jews it was postponed to
   the judgment of the world by God. This difficulty, however, could be
   explained away, either by the assumption of an increase in the torments
   of hell after the judgment, or by their entire postponement after the
   same. In any case the old Jewish eschatology was not threatened with
   dissolution from that quarter. The Greek conception of heaven, on the
   other hand, was bound to become dangerous immediately. Even before the
   rise of Christianity many of the Jews at Alexandria had become
   familiarized with the Greek doctrine of the assumption of those who
   were especially blessed to the gods in heaven, and had applied it to
   the fate of the martyrs and of other men pre-eminent for their piety.
   Similar doctrines began to circulate amongst certain Christians at a
   very early date. Here, however, they were consistent, and drew the
   right conclusions that bliss in heaven was incompatible with earthly
   joy at some later period. There was, they said, no such thing as a
   resurrection of the dead, or rather it had already taken place for
   Christians at baptism. The Pastoral letters, Polycarp, and Justin
   Martyr, opposed this new-fashioned eschatology as a Gnostic heresy. But
   the "getting into heaven" finally won the day, for all that, over the
   Jewish hope of the kingdom of God.

   The Gospel of St John would also appear to afford an instance of this
   Hellenization of the eschatology, although its author effectually
   conceals his true meaning. In the parting address to His disciples
   Jesus proclaims a hope of the future state which is entirely unlike
   that of the Jews. "In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were
   not so would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And
   if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again and receive you unto
   Myself, that where I am there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know
   the way," i.e., to the Father. This can scarcely mean anything else
   than that Jesus will fetch the Christians to God in heaven, and will
   not Himself live upon earth. We cannot, however, be quite certain
   whether we have not here merely an apologetic disguise of the Jewish
   eschatology from which we ought to distinguish the author's own belief.
   The kingdom of God and the resurrection of the dead are the pillars of
   the Jewish eschatology, and they are likewise the sure foundation upon
   which the author of the Johannine writings builds up his system. In the
   story of the raising of Lazarus he shows us that through Christ's word
   of power the dead shall one day come forth with their former bodies
   from the tomb. Whoever holds such an opinion is far removed from any
   tendency to dissolve or spiritualize the Jewish eschatology. Nor would
   he place the emphasis that he does upon the flesh of Christ upon earth,
   and even after the resurrection, if the opinion that he holds about the
   flesh did not differ very considerably from that of those who deny the
   resurrection. He is really a representative of the old eschatology from
   first to last; only as an apologist he tried to meet the Greeks in this
   point as in many others by endeavouring to adapt the Christian hope for
   the future to their own views. Fortunately Irenaeus furnishes us with a
   very old exegesis of the passage about the many mansions in the
   Father's house. It dates, in fact, from certain presbyters who were
   pupils of the apostles. They explained that enigmatic saying with
   reference to the different abodes of the blessed. According to their
   degree of piety they were to live after the resurrection either in
   heaven or in paradise or in the holy land. Here, then, we have a
   combination of old and new eschatologies which may well be ascribed to
   John, standing as he does upon the boundary line between two different
   worlds.

   Even the "Shepherd" of Hermas furnishes us with an example how deep an
   impression Greek and Roman eschatology made upon the Christians, though
   he is usually entirely on the side of the Jewish eschatology. An old
   woman appeared to him in the neighbourhood of Cumae, and gave him
   revelations contained in the roll of a book. Being asked who the woman
   was, he answered, "The Sibyl." "Thou art wrong," was the reply; "it was
   the Church." Here we have a typical instance of the way in which
   heathen ideas passed over into Christianity. Hermas knew from Virgil's
   √Üneid that the Sibyl of Cumae was endowed with the knowledge of the
   world to come, of heaven and of hell. She was accounted by him, as well
   as by many Christians, to be a true prophetess. Cumae, therefore, was
   the place where there were revelations. Churchman as he was, however,
   his imagination displaced the faith in the Sibyl. But then the Church
   had to appear in the guise of the Sibyl, and even occupy her dwelling.
   Paganism is Christianized and Christianity is Romanized.

   Would it, then, have been so great a loss had the Greeks with their
   ideas of the future blessedness won the day over the Jewish eschatology
   of the Christians? Jesus Himself had striven to purify and simplify the
   old hope in the kingdom, and to elevate it into the domain of eternity.
   St Paul had continued this work of Jesus by his great theory of the
   spiritual nature of the kingdom of God. It would seem, then, to be a
   decided retrogression when the Christians of the sub-apostolic age
   enthusiastically accept the whole mass of the Jewish apocalyptic and
   the wild fancies of the Greeks concerning hell, while the only doctrine
   which they regard as a heresy is that of the ascension of the soul to
   God, the highest and purest of the Greek hopes. And yet a true instinct
   guided the Church in this decision. That Greek doctrine was dangerous,
   because it meant the suppression of the social and moral elements in
   the ideal of the future state in favour of a merely selfish enjoyment
   of God by the individual soul. The future history of the Church proved
   over and over again how easily the selfish longing for heaven tended to
   make men forget their social duties here on earth. In the first age,
   the surrender of the old hope in the kingdom would have been tantamount
   to the abandonment of the faith in Providence and to the neglect of all
   work in the world. It was a time of conflict and of persecution. Who
   was to conquer, Christ or Rome? The centre of interest was in this
   earth. The persecutors had their portion in hell. The martyr's reward
   was to rule in the kingdom. If Christ only kept heaven, and the dragon
   retained the earth, then it availed but little to be a Christian. Jesus
   and St Paul would probably have fought like wise on the side of the
   Chiliasts. They took up their stand firmly and boldly upon this earth
   of ours, and there they meant to stand. That, too, is an essential part
   of religion.

CHAPTER VIII.

  GREEK PHILOSOPHY.

   THE Apostle Paul would have nothing to do with philosophy. He was still
   an apologist of the layman's religion. Human wisdom and divine
   revelation were entirely opposed to each other in his view. Long before
   his time, however, an alliance had been concluded between these two
   opposites in Alexandria and even in Palestine. As Clement of Alexandria
   so beautifully expresses it, the divine reason did not merely educate
   for Christianity the Jews through the law but the Greeks through
   philosophy. Philosophical and religious monotheism, philosophical and
   religious ethics, had met and had discovered, to their astonishment,
   that they were near relations. Had it not been for this alliance,
   Christianity had not conquered the world.

   The first meeting-point was in the criticism of the old polytheistic
   faith. Greek philosophers had written text-books in which all the
   weaknesses and failings of mythology had been collected and criticized.
   They had then proceeded to put forth various theories to explain the
   great deception, amongst others, the theory of Euhemerus. In his
   controversy with Apion, all that Josephus need do is simply to refer to
   the majority of the philosophers, especially Plato. There is no doubt
   that Aristides copied Greek patterns in his criticism. It is true that
   he says that he has the philosophers against him. It was, however, but
   one section of them, after all, which maintained that all the different
   gods proceeded in the end from one nature. In his Apologies Justin
   Martyr quotes the philosophers at every step as his authorities. By
   thus uniting with Greek philosophy in the removal of ignorant
   superstition, Christianity was able to boast at a very early date that
   it was a civilizing power.

   The positive point of contact in monotheism was of still greater
   importance. Originally, it is true, Jews and Greeks attached a very
   different signification to the same name, for the Greeks started from
   the laws of nature and the Jews from the miracles of their historical
   past. As a matter of fact, therefore, their agreement in the use of the
   same formula meant the immediate and wide acceptance of the
   philosophical view of the world, both by Judaism and by Christianity.
   The process begins in the Jewish writings, even in the Old Testament
   itself, in the 9th chapter of the Proverbs. So, too, Philo's idea of
   the world as an everlasting order fulfilled by the forces of Deity is
   entirely Greek.

   Turning to the New Testament, we find the first traces of this Greek
   view, though naturally still intermingled with Jewish conceptions, in
   the two little apologetic speeches in the Book of the Acts (xiv. and
   xvii.). In the speech at Lystra, God is first introduced as the
   creator, and that with the current Jewish expressions.
   Characteristically Jewish, too, is the assertion that in the first
   place God occupied Himself only with Israel, and treated the heathen
   according to the principle of laissez aller, laissez faire. The whole
   order of nature, however, is regarded as showing forth God's
   lovingkindness towards the heathen, and is in so far produced as a
   proof (testimony'). Here we have Greek popular philosophy in its
   simplest form; we can recognize it, too, by the emphasis laid on the
   goodness of God. The speech at Athens begins in the same way with a
   whole string of Jewish ideas--God the creator, criticism of the heathen
   religion, especially of idol worship, and then, finally, the
   eschatological menace. But in between these is a great deal borrowed
   from the Greeks. As in later Apologies, God is shown to be placed above
   all want. All the blessings of Nature, that we live and breathe, are
   His gifts. The heathen, too, have received their seasons and their
   boundaries from God, that they may seek God and find Him. Hereupon
   there follows the thoroughly Greek pantheistic formula, "In Him we live
   and move and have our being," and this is supported by the quotation
   from Aratus, that all men are of God's family. Even the word "the
   divine," the abstract term instead of the person, is a sign that
   Hellenism has already gained considerable ground.

   Our next document, St Clement's letter to the Corinthians, is entirely
   impregnated with Greek popular philosophy (see especially chaps. xix.,
   xxi., xxiv. seq., and lx.). The Godhead there appears as Father and
   Creator of the whole world--a faith in God the Father which differs
   greatly from that of the early Christian--or as the great Demiurge and
   Lord of the universe. The constant and invariable order of Nature as
   God's work is there described at great length. The heavens stand fast
   through God's government (dioikesis); day and night succeed each other
   without let or injury. Sun and moon and stars continue in their
   appointed course. The earth knows its seasons and the sea its bounds.
   Summer and winter, spring and autumn, all follow in due course. The
   winds and rivers are alike governed by fixed laws, and laws likewise
   govern the instincts and impulses of the animal world. All this has
   been ordered by the Lord of the whole world, that peace and harmony may
   prevail, and all that He does is good. At first sight, it is true, this
   description of Nature resembles that of the Psalms. In both cases
   everything is referred back to God's own command. And yet the point of
   view is more Greek than Jewish. The independence of Nature is greater.
   Between it and God stands His unchangeable dioikesis.'

   In chaps. xxiv. and xxv. we have the first attempt to find a rational
   basis for the belief in the resurrection by analogies from Nature.
   There is a resurrection throughout Nature, there is the change of night
   and day, of seed-time and of harvest. This is a proof of the greatness
   of God's providence. The view is further supported by the great miracle
   of the resurrection of the phoenix, and finally there is a sufficient,
   if somewhat meagre, scriptural proof from the Old Testament.

   The concluding prayer is again addressed to the Demiurge of the
   universe, who has revealed the everlasting cosmical order by His
   manifestations. The prayer for princes (see page 108, supra) who stand
   under this government, is based upon this general belief in Providence.

   The influence of the Greek cosmology and its optimism is especially
   striking at the beginning of Aristides' apology. "Through God's
   providence, O king, I came into the world, and as I regarded the
   heavens and the earth and the sea and the sun and the moon, I was
   amazed at the order (dioikesis) of these things. But when I perceived
   that the world and all that therein is, moves according to a fixed law,
   then I understood that He that moves it and rules over it is none other
   than God. For He that moves is mightier than that which is moved, and
   He that rules is stronger than those that are governed: Him therefore I
   call God. It is He that directs all things." A principle of Aristotle
   is here directly taken over in a popular form. The enthusiastic
   admiration of the beauty of the cosmos is also thoroughly Greek.

   God and the universe are bound more closely together in this Greek
   popular philosophy than in the Jewish faith. The belief in Providence
   was based upon natural religion. Lactantius could declare that it was
   the common property of all religions, and was firmly established before
   all revelation. Christianity is built up upon a rationalistic
   cosmology. This, however, was one of the tendencies which affected the
   new religion.

   God and the world are rent asunder--this process goes on simultaneously
   with the former--the conception of God is emptied of everything that is
   concrete and subtilized into something purely transcendental, into the
   negation of the world. One can only say of God what He is not. Thereby
   religion is forced to take refuge in flight from the world and
   mysticism, if it will still retain God.

   Here, too, the Jews had shown the way. Philo, and after him Josephus,
   had drawn up long catalogues of the negative predicates of
   God--unbegotten, unchangeable, needing nothing, unknown in His essence,
   incomprehensible, without qualities. Josephus declares expressly that
   the Jewish conception of God is none other than the philosophical, such
   as was taught by Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Plato, the Stoics, and nearly
   all the philosophers. Here, as everywhere, the Christians had merely to
   follow in the path which had been marked out for them by the Jews.

   We find the first traces of this negative conception of God even in New
   Testament writings, in the Pastoral epistles, and in St John. There God
   is called "the King of the ages, the incorruptible, the invisible, the
   only true God," or "the blessed and only potentate, who only hath
   immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no man hath seen or
   can see." "God no man hath seen." How widely removed are these Greek
   thoughts from the earlier Jewish realistic faith in God, the faith of
   men whose greatest delight was in the theophanies!

   Even Hermas has taken up into his short commandment of faith in God the
   formula, "Who comprehends all, but is Himself not comprehended." An
   apologetic tract dating from the beginning of the second century, the
   sermon of St Peter, gives us the earliest Christian catalogue with the
   negative predicates of God. The God of the Christians, we here read, is
   a God who was at the beginning before all things and has power over the
   end. He is the invisible, who seeth everything; the incomprehensible,
   who comprehends everything; who needeth nothing, whom all need: the
   inconceivable, the eternal, the imperishable, the uncreated, who
   created all by His word of power.

   Aristides, who is acquainted with the sermon of Peter, describes God as
   Him that is without beginning, the invisible, the immortal, who needeth
   nothing, who is exalted high above all passions and defects, such as
   wrath and sorrow and ignorance. Through Him all things coexist. He
   needeth neither sacrifices nor offerings, nor anything that is visible,
   but all need Him. Later apologists simply follow Aristides with shorter
   or longer catalogues.

   Such was the origin of a contradiction which crept into the Christian
   faith in God. For the stoical theory of immanence, to which the
   doctrine of the dioikesis corresponds, and the Platonic theory of
   transcendence, which finds its expression in the negative predicates,
   are irreconcilable. Immanence implies the complete unity of God with
   the cosmos. Transcendence implies the conception of God as the entire
   negation of the world. This contradiction very frequently escaped
   notice. God was thrust out of sight far behind the world, and yet the
   belief in a constant divine providence is not abandoned. Where the
   inconsistency, however, was noticed, there the doctrine of intermediary
   beings arose, which furnished a proof of the divine power in the world
   of phenomena without locating the eternal in the finite.

   Angels and demons were the connecting link between the remote God and
   the visible world for the popular belief. Philosophy substituted the
   Logoi' or the Logos' and the Holy Spirit for the angels.

   Here Philo had paved the way for the Christians. He himself was a
   Platonist, feeling himself a stranger in this phenomenal world while
   his true home was in the world of ideas. He did not introduce the
   conception of Logos into Jewish thought. Stoic and Aristotelian
   philosophers had done that before him. But just as he appropriated the
   work of his Jewish predecessors to a very large extent, even where they
   followed other Greek philosophers, so he took up the conception of the
   Logos from this tradition, and adapted it to Platonic modes of thought
   by defining it more sharply, and by individualizing it both as regards
   God and as regards the world. Even in Philo we find the Logos called
   the "second God," and the Old Testament was interpreted with reference
   to him.

   Nor was Philo the only forerunner in this direction.

   In the Wisdom of Solomon the spirit of wisdom is described, in
   accordance with the Stoic doctrine, as an infinitely subtilized,
   universal reason that pervades everything and is yet distinct from God
   Himself.

   Of Christian writers, St Paul was the first to look upon Christ as such
   an intermediary being, higher than all the angels, yet lower than God
   Himself, nor was the term Logos as yet applied to Him. It was no
   philosophical problem that had moved St Paul to take this view. He
   wished to find Christ in the whole of the Old Testament. This was only
   possible by depriving God and the angels of a great portion of the
   sphere of their activity. Jesus, however, thereby comes to be the God
   that actively works in the world.

   Then the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews developed his Pauline
   theology by means of conceptions taken directly from Alexandrine
   sources. The world was created through the Son of God. He is the
   reflection of God's glory and the impress of His substance, upholding
   all things by the word of His power. In the 45th Psalm He is called
   God--of course as Son, i.e., as God in a secondary sense. The very word
   reflection' is used as an attribute of wisdom in the Wisdom of Solomon.
   But this disciple of Philo did not venture as yet to apply the word
   Logos' to Jesus.

   In the prologue of the Fourth Gospel, however, this name appears
   clearly and unmistakably. "In the beginning was the Logos, and the
   Logos was with God, and the Logos was a God." Dependence on Philo's
   writings is possible, yet it is not even absolutely necessary to
   presuppose it. The cosmological character of the opening sentences
   clearly points to a philosophical source. Between God and the world
   stands the Logos. On the one hand He is with God, on the other
   everything is created by Him. He is called a' God, but not the' God; in
   exactly the same way Philo distinguished between God with and God
   without the article, and supported this distinction by Old Testament
   proofs. The most suitable name is Son of God, or rather the only Son,
   in distinction from the children' of God, who only become children by
   His mediation. He is not only the creator of the world but its
   supporter, as in Him is all life.

   Now the fact is of great importance that the man who introduced the
   Logos into the Gospel was not himself a philosopher, nor did the
   problem of the mediation between God and the world cause him any
   anxiety or difficulty. It is for apologetic and not philosophical ends
   that he makes use of the theory of the Logos. If, therefore, he
   ascribes a cosmological signification to the Logos, notwithstanding all
   this, then he must have been determined to do so by a firmly
   established tradition. It was an accepted theory--derived either from
   Philo or elsewhere--that the Logos had created and supported the world.
   The evangelist accepts this view in order to make it the basis for the
   transition to the apologetic, which is the sole aim of the whole of his
   prologue.

   He lived at a time when the Gnostics had already begun to interpolate
   their endless genealogies of aeons between the purely negative first
   cause of all things and the existing world. The belief in the existence
   of intermediary beings between God and ourselves had naturally been
   strengthened in consequence. The evangelist himself reduces the number
   of these intermediary beings to one--to that one who was most
   intelligible to the Greeks. The fact that he does this in a Gospel
   constitutes the boldness of his act.

   It was the celebrated passage in the Gospel of St John which
   established the supremacy of the theory of the Logos in the Church. We
   find a reference to it as early as in Justin Martyr. We read, he says,
   in one of the memoirs of the apostles of Jesus: "He was the only Son of
   the Father of all, begotten of Him in a unique manner as Logos and
   Power."

   The position that Justin occupies with regard to the Logos theory is at
   bottom that of his great teacher. He uses it for apologetic purposes.
   He has no interest whatever in its cosmological aspect. It is a
   traditional doctrine, and no new thesis of Justin's, that God created
   and ordered the world by the Logos. It is only in one point that we
   recognize that we are no longer dealing with the earliest age. The
   manner in which the Logos proceeds from God has come to be the subject
   of reflection, and no wonder, when we remember the interminable
   speculations of the Gnostics as to the procession of the aeons from the
   First Cause. Justin finds the closest analogy in fire. Just as from one
   fire a second is kindled without any diminution of the former, so the
   Logos proceeds from God as a second divine being, and yet God Himself
   does not suffer any loss thereby. He decidedly rejects the comparison
   of the Logos to a sunbeam, which the sun sends forth as it rises and
   again draws back as it sets, because it destroys the personal
   individuality of the Logos.

   It was inevitable, if God disappeared behind the world so completely
   that all His government was effected by intermediary beings, that
   matter should all the more appear to have an independent existence, and
   its origin become a problem for Christian teachers.

   Once again it was the Jews who had framed the theories with the help of
   Greek conceptions, and the Christians had taken them over. It would
   seem that they developed the doctrine of the creation as a bringing
   into being of the previously non-existent in the interest of
   monotheism.

   The earliest statement of this theory is to be found in the second book
   of the Maccabees: "Look up to heaven and on the earth, and when thou
   hast seen all things therein, know thou that God created them out of
   the things that were not (ex ouk o'nton}, and that thus the race of men
   arose." This is to be the basis of the faith in a life after death.

   This theory found early acceptance with the Christians. St Paul calls
   God Him who summons into being that which was not (ta` me` o'nta). He
   is thinking of the awakening of the dead, but the same remark applies
   to the creation. The Epistle to the Hebrews formulates the belief in
   creation in accordance with this theory: By faith we understand that
   the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen
   hath been made out of things which do not appear (me` ek phainome'non).
   Hermas, too, enunciates the same theory in the First Commandment: "It
   is God who created all things, and perfected them, and made all things
   out of that which was not so that it was." Although Hebrew in origin,
   this theory is Greek in form. We are reminded that Plato calls matter
   the non-existent (me` o'n).

   A second theory supposed matter to be eternal but in a chaotic
   condition, and caused the cosmos to arise through God's creation from
   chaos. This, theory might be based on Gen. i., "The earth was, waste
   and void." We find it amongst the Jews in the Wisdom of Solomon, where
   we read of wisdom, "He created the world out of shapeless matter."
   Justin is the first Christian author, as far as we know, to accept it:
   "In the beginning God, of His goodness, created all things out of
   shapeless matter. By transforming shapeless matter, God created the
   world."

   The two theories, creation out of nothing, creation out of the chaos,
   are not in reality very dissimilar. Philo, e.g., uses words of the
   first theory, and thinks according to the second. If only the thought
   of the creation is strictly preserved the rest is a matter of
   indifference.

   The early Christians did not really elaborate any cosmologies. The
   story of Genesis was quite sufficient for them. The need had not as yet
   arisen. The world was God's. This was the unshaken faith of the Church.
   It was only the Gnostics, who separated the redemption from the
   creation, who were obliged to ransack Greek philosophy, and hunt after
   cosmological questions.

   Greeks, Jews, and Christians thus finding a common meeting ground in
   their monotheistic faith, the horizon of the early Christians was
   immensely enlarged. They suddenly became aware of the fact that the
   Gentile world was by no means the God-forsaken, devil-deluded mass of
   corruption which it had before been held to be. In its monotheistic
   philosophy it possessed much that was closely akin to the truth. The
   same conclusion was reached by an even superficial examination of Greek
   ethics. Jewish laws and Stoic ethics had long ago met and concluded an
   alliance at Alexandria. The four Greek cardinal virtues are praised in
   the Wisdom of Solomon, in the fourth book of the Maccabees, and by
   Philo. Even St Paul had adopted ethical conceptions from the popular
   philosophy, such as reason, nature, and conscience, nor had the idea of
   the law written on the heart of man, which was so widely prevalent
   amongst both Greeks and Jews, repelled him. He and his successors
   discovered that however Christian life might differ from heathen, there
   was a very far-reaching theoretical agreement in the fundamental moral
   conceptions, in what was to be called good and evil.

   Now the more firmly this knowledge of a certain relationship between
   Christianity and all that was good and sound in Hellenism was
   established amongst Christian teachers, the more eagerly were
   apologetics bound to attempt to profit by the relationship. But one
   more bold step was needed and the divine element would be recognized
   even in non-Christian religions. Hence arose a twofold task for
   apologetics. The foundation of the relationship between the Christian
   and non-Christian must be proved, and at the same time care must be
   taken that the superiority of Christianity should no longer be
   questioned. The absolute claims advanced by the Church must be
   reconciled with the relative rights of so-called natural religion.

   One great obstacle stood in the way. There was the old theory set up by
   St Paul of the Spirit as the exclusive possession of the Church. Did
   not the Christians feel themselves from the very first in direct
   opposition to the world around them? Their thoughts, feelings and
   experiences appeared to them to be something altogether peculiar, which
   at first only occasioned contradiction and revealed itself in this
   contradiction as something which had its origin beyond this world.
   Based upon this conviction, which was commonly held by all Christians,
   St Paul set up the theory that the natural man neither understands nor
   can understand the things of the Spirit. In spite of the vigorous
   exclusiveness which this theory assumes in its ecclesiastical dress, it
   reveals that feeling of possessing something peculiar and all-powerful
   without which Christianity would never have made its way through the
   world. But the whole edifice began to totter when apologetics suddenly
   appealed to the direct opposite, to the relationship with that which
   was outside the Church. All that was characteristic of Christianity
   threatened to be held by an exceedingly precarious tenure.

   As was to be expected, the new thoughts were at first firmly
   established side by side with the old ones, without expelling them or
   even weakening them. We possess a very wonderful document which sets us
   in the very midst of this transition, revealing as it does the old
   exclusive spirit and the new assimilating tendencies. It is the Gospel
   of St John.

   From one point of view this writing is as clear a piece of evidence as
   we possess of the narrow and sectarian spirit in early Christianity.
   The theory of the Spirit here assumes the most exclusive shape. Whilst
   other Christian teachers--the author of the First Epistle of St Peter
   and of the letter of St Clement--readily assume that the Christian
   spirit spoke from the Old Testament prophets, John declares that the
   Spirit did not exist at all before Christ's ascension. It is not
   possible to confine the Spirit more rigorously within the bounds of the
   Christian Church (and along with the Spirit the higher knowledge).
   Hence the unbridged chasm between church and world in John xiv.-xvi. It
   is only to the Church that Jesus sends the spirit of truth. "The world
   cannot receive Him, because it neither beholdeth Him nor knoweth Him.
   Ye know Him, for He abideth with you, and shall be in you." This
   passage we may illustrate by the conversation between Jesus and the
   Jewish Rabbi Nicodemus, in which Christ and the Jew stand opposed to
   each other as spirit and flesh. Only he that is baptized and has
   received the Spirit is able to grasp the Christian mysteries. To one
   outside the Church they are all folly; he cannot even understand the
   Christian language, and stumbles along from one misunderstanding to
   another. To take the birth from above as implying above all a moral
   experience, is to interpret this conversation wrongly. The moral
   element is comparatively unimportant. A man may be moral even before he
   becomes a Christian. All the emphasis is laid upon knowledge, upon the
   understanding. Nicodemus is the type of a Jew who lacks the one thing
   needful in spite of all his wisdom--the open mind for the Christian
   faith. This mind is only to be acquired within the Church. These are
   thoughts similar to those of St Paul in First Corinthians. They exclude
   all apologetics if followed out consistently. It is the early Church
   which thus speaks.

   But this narrow theory of the Spirit has its exact counterpart in the
   Logos doctrine of the prologue. There we have apologetics, and with
   what grand liberty of thought. There is a divine revelation even
   outside the Christian Church. First of all, amongst the Jews, the
   people of the Logos' "own possession," where patriarchs and prophets
   both heard and saw some fragments of the Divine Revelation. But not
   only there. The Logos is the light of men. He lighteth every man that
   cometh into the world. He was in the world long before the appearance
   of Christ. All the Divine Revelation, all the truth that existed in the
   world and still exists, may be traced back to the same Logos whom the
   Christians honour. The tragic sum total of history is, it is true,
   clearly set forth by the prologue. The Divine Revelation met with
   resistance; the world did not recognize the Logos. The mere fact of the
   existence of the Gentile world taken as a whole sufficiently proves
   this. Israel's history, too, is rather a record of resistance to
   revelation than of faithful acceptation. And yet there were children of
   God before the life of Jesus upon earth. Christianity is nothing new:
   it is as old as, nay, older than the world itself. All that is
   reasonable in the world is divine, and its source is revelation. But
   wherein, then, does the advantage of Christianity consist? In it alone
   the Logos became flesh, so that the full divine glory became visible to
   the eyes of men and was handled by their hands. The great prerogative
   which Christianity possesses above all other religions is the
   overpowering evidence of the divine in the person of Jesus. Therefore
   it is the completion, the conclusion, of the whole history of
   revelation.

   This method of apologetics was only rendered possible by a Greek
   conception, the Logos. The evangelist presupposes that his readers are
   familiar with the idea of the Logos. That is why he has hopes of being
   able to lead them to Christ. As one can only come to Christ within the
   Church, the object of the apologetics is clear. If you wish to attain
   to the complete possession of the Logos, and be altogether reasonable,
   then become Christians.

   These thoughts of the prologue do not recur in the course of the
   narrative. The author shows his good taste in not putting his own
   theories into Christ's mouth. But in other ways he remains true to his
   apologetic standpoint. He ascribes to non-Christian ethics a
   preparatory position: it is a school to lead to Christ. That also was a
   bold innovation. It is true that St Paul had once theoretically
   conceded the point that there might be heathen who fulfil the law. But
   his only object in making this concession was to abate the pretensions
   of the Jews to the exclusive possession of the law. Practically he
   condemns all heathen without exception as lost sinners, in whom dwells
   nothing good, who entirely depend upon the Spirit of Christ in their
   Church for the power to fulfil the divine will.

   The majority of Christians assumed as a matter of course that all
   heathen were unrighteous,' sinners,' that only Christians could do that
   which was good. A consequence of this was that the heathen began to
   speak of the Christians as of a company of criminals that shunned the
   light and sought to escape punishment, and indeed it was easy to point
   to many abandoned outcasts who had obtained admission in the Church. It
   would seem that the author of the Lucan writings was one of the first
   to call attention to the danger that there lay in the conception of
   Christianity as a religion for sinners only. Hence in his first speech
   to the Gentiles, St Peter declares: Everywhere he that feareth God and
   worketh righteousness is acceptable to Him and can become a Christian.
   The fourth evangelist goes a good deal further when he describes
   Christianity simply as the religion of all that is good and healthy.
   Just as Logos and Spirit above, however, so now the recognition and the
   rejection of a non-Christian morality strive violently for the mastery.
   The farewell speeches of Jesus to the disciples put forward the old
   proposition: "as the branch apart from the vine cannot bring forth any
   fruit," so the Christian without Jesus can do nothing, or apart from
   the ecclesiastical faith there can be no true morality. But many
   passages of the twelve first chapters intended for the non-Christian
   world speak a quite different language. The existence of good people
   outside of the Church is a necessary presupposition here. "Every one
   that doeth ill hateth the light and cometh not to the light lest his
   works should be reproved; but he that doeth the truth cometh to the
   light that his works may be made manifest, because they have been
   wrought in God." Hence the absence of all emphasis on the forgiveness
   of sins in the sayings of Jesus. Mention is, of course, made of the
   fact, for that the world needs saving is still as true as ever. But yet
   Jesus is far from being the Saviour of sinners as He was in the Third
   Gospel. Plainly and unmistakably the author appeals to all sound moral
   natures in the invitation: He that doeth God's will shall recognize the
   divine nature of Christianity. It is just such pure and noble
   characters as Nathaniel that the Father draws to the Son, i.e., suffers
   to become Christians.

   Wherein, then, it may very naturally be asked, does the advantage of
   Christianity consist, if there are those that work righteousness even
   outside the Church, and yet the road to blessedness is through the
   Church alone? The author would probably answer that the vision of the
   kingdom, the gift of everlasting life, the resurrection of the dead,
   the close communion with God, do in any case continue to be divine
   gifts which the doing of the divine will neither gives by itself nor
   deserves. Obedience to God which manifests itself in the moral life is,
   it is true, a condition of blessedness, but is not blessedness itself.
   Such is the opinion of all the early Christians, the simple proof of
   which is their eschatology. Therefore for the sake of future
   blessedness, even those that are morally sound still have need to
   become Christians. And besides, we need but look at the First Epistle
   of St John to see how high an opinion the evangelist personally
   entertained as to the gift of forgiveness.

   A Christian is a man who has received forgiveness. St John's final
   opinion is surely this, then: that life without Christ is entirely
   sinful, if even life with Christ never roots out sin. The statements,
   therefore, about the naturally good who come to the light have to be
   limited as far as the principle itself is concerned. They have only an
   apologetic value. But for all that, this instance of an apology of
   Christianity without any theory of sin, simply on the basis of the
   attractive power of the good, is very striking.

   The peculiarity of the Johannine theology is just this, that Logos and
   Spirit are placed side by side in it and nowhere mediated. On the one
   hand, we have a perfectly open mind for the world and wide sympathies;
   on the other, extreme narrowness, and both are harboured by the same
   man. He stands at the turning-point of the ages. For him the old
   sectarian spirit in Christianity still resists any attempt at an
   approach towards the world. But at the same time his apologetic
   instincts and the desire to gain converts cause him to go out beyond
   all these narrow boundaries. In the same writing we have philosophy and
   its antinomy. And such is ever the way with those writers to whom it is
   vouchsafed to exercise a widespread influence over widely different
   natures.

   Within a few years of the date of John a likewise unknown author writes
   the sermon of St Peter. He speaks of Jesus therein as the law' and
   reason.' This apologist can scarcely have been thinking of the Jewish
   law when he uses the word law. The fact that he couples law with reason
   prevents our making this assumption. It is the law which all men
   possess and know, the sum of moral knowledge which the then world
   presupposed in every man. When Jesus therefore was called Reason and
   Law, the author meant to speak of Him as the ideal of all religion and
   moral knowledge.

   We find this view set forth at some length in Justin, the philosophical
   successor of St John. His apologetics deal with the conception of the
   Logos, the Dialogue with Trypho rather with the idea of the law. By
   this time, however, the consequences were drawn from St John's apology.
   The theory of the Spirit was dropped. This result followed necessarily
   from the altered position of Christianity in the world. The doctrine of
   the Spirit suited its earlier sectarian existence with its aversion to
   the world. It was abandoned when letters were addressed by the Church
   to the Roman emperors seeking their protection, for to them this appeal
   to the spirit of the Christians was bound to appear a childish mistake.
   The question now was how Christians could defend themselves against the
   world while using the world's own weapons. But the old theory of the
   Spirit was likewise rendered untenable by the custom of disputation
   with Jewish Rabbis. He that appeals to the Spirit has no right to
   engage in disputation. He cannot do it. The necessary conditions for
   disputation--an intellectual form of duelling--were the employment of
   the same weapons, the knowledge of the Scriptures, a right exegesis,
   and the drawing of right conclusions. Of course, if we possessed
   devotional or even anti-gnostic writings of Justin's, writings intended
   to be read within the Church, we should very probably infer that
   Christians still appealed, and that constantly, to the Spirit. But such
   appeal was found to disappear from the apologies and disputations.

   Justin's remarks about the Logos look like a learned exposition of the
   prologue of St John. For Justin, too, the Logos is the light of all
   men. Justin, however, consciously applies this statement to Greek
   philosophy, of which St John had not as yet thought. Reason dwells in
   every man. All that happens reasonably is an effect of the Logos
   Christ. The Logos cannot be traced more clearly in the prophets than in
   the philosophers, Socrates, the Stoics, the poets. In the Second
   Apology Justin adopts the Stoic expression of the spermatic Logos. But
   as in the case of St John, the full revelation of the Logos is only to
   be found within the Church. Here alone the Logos became man and took to
   Himself a shape. Here alone He was revealed, revealed perfect and
   entire and no longer partially, and that so clearly that all
   misunderstanding is impossible. And, besides, Justin limits his bold
   statements concerning the universal revelation of the Logos by the
   assertion, which he has taken over from the Jewish apologetic, that,
   after all, the Greek philosophers borrowed or stole out of the Old
   Testament the truths which they declared.

   There is a still further development when we pass from the few
   scattered indications of St John concerning the morality that exists
   outside of the Church to Justin's clear theory. There is a natural
   moral law which existed in the hearts of men long before the Mosaic
   dispensation. The patriarchs lived in accordance therewith, and were
   therefore well pleasing to God. Nor were the Greek philosophers or
   poets without knowledge of it, for the Logos-seed taught them. This
   natural moral law, largely forgotten in course of time, obscured and
   disfigured as it had come to be, Christ restored again, and gave to it
   its simplest eternal expression.

   These apologetics differ completely from St Paul's. The difference lies
   in the far larger measure of concession that is made to the Greek
   world. The Christians acquire the consciousness that their religion is
   just as closely related to Hellenism as it is to Judaism. They agree
   with Greek philosophers and poets in three main points--in the
   monotheistic faith, in the view of the moral law and of moral freedom,
   and in the hope of a future life. Apologetics now start from this fact,
   finding powerful aid in the two Greek conceptions of Reason and Law.
   These are interpreted as the gifts of Christ, and the man Jesus is
   regarded as their incarnation and perfection. Through reason and law
   all men are led right up to the door of the Church. But it is only
   entrance into the Church that guides them to absolute truth and
   certainty. Nothing could be broader or more tolerant than these
   apologetics at the beginning, but in the end they are confined within
   very narrow limits. The new theory is no whit less ecclesiastical than
   the Pauline. Measured by a religious standard, it is far the inferior.
   St Paul placed redemption in the centre, here we have revelation; on
   the one hand we have the new life, on the other the higher knowledge.
   We have the apologetics of rationalism, nor is the prominent position
   assigned to reason fortuitous. Such a system was bound to be favourably
   received by the Greeks. It threatened Christianity, however, with a
   great danger. The new religion ran the risk of being dragged down to
   the merely intellectual level, and deprived in a great measure of its
   regenerative moral force. But a new and hopeful vista likewise opened
   out to it. It was only now that Christianity completely entered into
   the great intellectual history of mankind, finding points of contact
   with all good and great thoughts, and producing in interaction with
   them, both giving and receiving, a new and deeper conception of God and
   of reality.

   The unmistakable tendency on the part of apologetics to incorporate
   philosophical conceptions is, however, only one side of the great
   though gradual transformation of Christianity into a philosophy like
   that of Philo's. Several other phenomena point in the same direction.

   Philo and Josephus had proclaimed the Jewish religion to be a
   philosophy long before this. But such an idea was entirely foreign to
   the first preachers of Christianity. For St Paul the word philosophy'
   denoted a bad, an ungodlike form of science, and such was the opinion
   of all Christians for a long time to come. Nearly a century passed
   before an ecclesiastical Christian, Justin, ventured to call
   Christianity the only certain and useful philosophy. But then we must
   remember that facts precede reflexion as a rule. Two writings that were
   accepted in the canon--the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Fourth
   Gospel--give rise to the question whether Christianity itself was not
   beginning to become philosophical.

   The Epistle to the Hebrews is still entirely under the Jewish
   Alexandrine influence. The use it makes of the Old Testament, of
   definitions and of dogmas, its Platonic terminology, are all
   philosophical. Nowhere else in the New Testament do we find such a
   definition of Faith as that in Heb. xi. 1, nor such dogmas as to the
   creation of the world and the being of God as in Heb. xi. 3-6. The Old
   Testament is regarded as a mysterious book of oracles which is to be
   interpreted according to Platonic presuppositions. A fundamental
   presupposition is the distinction between two worlds, the invisible
   world of ideas, the type, and this present world, which is the
   antitype. Yonder are the heavenly realities, the patterns; here the
   shadows, the copies, the figures. The definition of Faith rests upon
   this distinction. It is a conviction regarding the invisible, i.e., the
   certainty of the world of ideas. Only all this Platonism receives an
   unexpected Christian turn by the combination of the Platonic world of
   ideas with this eschatology. In future it is to become visible. It is
   through this turn that the element of hope enters into the definition
   of Faith. From a theoretical point of view, therefore, the Christianity
   of the Epistle to the Hebrews is Platonic philosophy plus Christian
   hope. At the same time it is perfectly clear which is the source of
   true life.

   Now it is a question whether the Fourth Gospel also presupposes a like
   Greek philosophy even if it does not preach it. In favour of this view
   we have the fact that it became the favourite gospel of the Alexandrine
   philosophers.

   It was by comparing St John with the Synoptists that Clement and Origen
   were impressed by the philosophical character of the Fourth Gospel.
   This we can readily understand. We need but fix our attention on two
   points--the facts that are no longer related of Christ, and in the next
   place the style of His discourses. They are for the most part of a
   parabolical character, such as no initiated hearer could understand;
   words are used in different senses; there are definitions of God and of
   everlasting life. Next to His Divinity there is nothing in the Jesus of
   the Fourth Gospel which strikes one more prominently than the
   Teacher--that is, in other words, the philosopher. In the first gospels
   Jesus is not called the Redeemer at all, but He is described as such.
   In the Fourth Gospel He is not the Redeemer, but at most the teacher of
   the truth that He is the Redeemer. He is fond of pouring out a stream
   of mysteries in apparently simple language, much as did the Clement of
   the Stromateis a century later. Hence even the last discourses assume
   at times something of a cold and didactic tone. The stories of the
   miracles, too, resemble didactic parables. In them miracles are the
   outward signs of spiritual truths. The author appears to be less
   concerned with the wonder than with its deeper meaning. In this sense
   one may term the Fourth Gospel a philosophical work.

   This conception, however, of the Fourth Gospel as a philosophical work
   to which the Alexandrines first gave currency, and which is still
   widely held to-day, is a radically wrong one. John's main idea, the
   descent of the Son of Man to reveal the Father, is unphilosophical. It
   is not in philosophical speculation, but in myths, that we must seek
   for analogies to it. The only purpose which the author sets before
   himself in this work is the awakening of Faith in this Son of Man who
   has come from heaven. True, it bears a strongly didactic character, but
   the truths that it teaches are those of the Church's apologetic--the
   dignity of Jesus, the office of Jesus, the rewards of the faithful, the
   punishment of the foes of the Church--all this, and not truths of a
   universal philosophy. God is defined as Spirit in order to establish
   the superiority of Christian universalism over Jewish and Samaritan
   particularism. The saying as to everlasting life is anything rather
   than a real definition, and all the conclusions drawn therefrom as to
   St John's intellectualism are certainly not drawn in accordance with
   his true nature. Again, a philosophical character has been ascribed to
   the words, "Blessed are they that do not see and yet believe." Yet all
   that they say is that we must believe in the resurrection of Jesus
   without having been an eyewitness thereof. So, too, the Johannine
   miracles are never intended to be taken in a purely allegorical sense.
   The fact of their actual occurrence is the irrefragable proof of God's
   appearance upon earth. Luther's estimate is the right one when he
   speaks of the Fourth Gospel as the great gospel of the grace of God and
   of faith, and points to its harmony with St Paul.

   On the whole, all that has been said about the influence of Hellenism
   upon Christianity in this epoch must be regarded as something
   preliminary, and therefore incomplete. It is only a beginning of the
   great Hellenizing of Christianity; the old piety existed side by side
   with it in full force, and Jewish influences are evenly balanced
   against Greek. And still more, Judaism, especially Hellenistic Judaism,
   still constantly forms the channel for Greek culture to enter into the
   Church itself. Yet this beginning is certainly not without importance.
   By the year 100 we are almost justified in saying that the germ had
   been formed of the complete transformation of Christianity. To judge by
   externals indeed the Greeks are still called wicked heathen whose gods
   are demons. Whilst Christianity proclaims itself as the true Judaism it
   would only be regarded as the enemy of Paganism. And yet how much it
   borrows in the sphere of religion and philosophy alike! The Greek
   religion presented it with the new God Jesus, the mysteries, and the
   picture of hell, while Greek philosophy furnished a rational faith--a
   conception of the cosmos--an entirely new apologetic based upon the
   ideas of reason and law, the first beginnings of the treatment of
   Christianity as a philosophy. These accretions turned out to be both a
   blessing and a curse to Christendom. The new religion is dragged deep
   down into the depths of superstition and of magic till the living
   person of Jesus is almost lost in the complicated system of
   ecclesiastical rites and mysteries. And the evil excrescences of Greek
   intellectualism, sophistry, rhetorical extravagance, the love of
   argument, make their entry into the Churches. But at the same time the
   intellectual horizon of the Christians is widened, they begin to
   develop a view of the universe out of their faith, and to honour in the
   works of Greek philosophers the same divine power which spoke to them
   from the life of Jesus. And that rightly. For in that period of
   confusion, when religion and superstition were everywhere intermingled,
   it was Greek philosophy alone which rendered it possible for men to
   understand spiritual realities, such as the Gospel, in a spiritual
   fashion. Greek philosophy alone permanently preserved Christianity from
   degenerating into the lowest form of superstition into which multitudes
   that thirsted for salvation and that needed redemption threatened to
   sink. For such multitudes any and every kind of service or mystery
   answered the purpose, provided it procured peace and comfort. One of
   the best results of the Fourth Gospel was that Christ and truth were
   indissolubly connected, and that thereby religion was directed beyond
   the wishes and needs of the individual heart to the everlasting
   spiritual realities, to attain to an even deeper and more living
   knowledge of which had been the great end of Greek, philosophy.

CATHOLICISM AND GNOSTICISM.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX.

  THE ORIGIN OF GNOSTICISM.

   THEOLOGICAL inquiry has not as yet mastered the complex and intricate
   problem of Gnosticism. Our description must therefore confine itself
   carefully to the few points that have been clearly ascertained, unless
   it is content to assume an altogether problematical character. With the
   question of the origin of Gnosticism it is only concerned in a very
   secondary degree. Can Gnosticism be derived from the same root as
   Catholicism or not? Was it imported from outside sources, or does it
   spring out of Christianity itself?

   The question can only be answered if Gnosticism itself be present to
   the reader's mind in bare outline. For of course it can only be a
   question of presenting the chief features, that which the different
   Gnostic sects possessed in common.

   The following points are common to at least a great portion of the
   Gnostic schools and sects.

   1. A definite principle of authority. The Spirit is the source and norm
   of all knowledge which thus claims to be based upon revelation. The
   sacred writings play a great part--the apocryphal even more than the
   canonical. But it is the Spirit that decides what is divine in these
   books and what is not, and that alone understands the revelation
   contained in the sacred book. As the Old Testament is the canon of all
   Christians, it is exposed to the sharpest criticism and partially to
   rejection, or at any rate to an interpretation which is almost
   tantamount to rejection. In any case it is the Spirit interpreting it
   that is the highest authority. This holds good with respect to Jesus
   and the apostles. In their case, too, the Spirit decides as to the
   acceptation and rejection and the interpretation. Naturally the Spirit
   does this, not as the individual human spirit, but as a divine
   revelation within him.

   2. A definite belief in God. The God who had hitherto been worshipped
   both by Jews and Christians, the Jehovah of the Jews, is not the
   highest God revealed by Jesus. This latter is rather a new, hitherto
   concealed God who is enthroned high above the world and above all
   spirits; high, too, above the creator of the world. He is not the God
   of this world, the author of men's creation and preservation, and,
   generally speaking, this world does not belong to Him directly.
   Practical consequences of this are the destruction of the faith in
   Providence, and the hostile, or at best indifferent, relation of the
   Christian to the whole of this world, to nature, to the body, to human
   ordinances; all of which we ought not only not to ascribe to the
   highest God, but rather regard as something that has fallen away from
   Him.

   3. A definite eschatology. Man's chief end is to return to God, who is
   his home, to the uppermost realm of light out of this prison-house of
   decadence and of exile. The creature in man, the flesh, is not capable
   of this return, but only that element, call it spirit or soul, which
   has had its birth in the celestial light. Immediately after death the
   soul of man is intended to set out upon its homeward journey, and to
   make its way upwards through the innumerable hostile spirits which fill
   the long interval between God and this lower earth.

   4. A definite Christology. The Saviour Christ is a spiritual being sent
   down from the realm of light above to the earth below in order to
   reveal divine truth to men and to illuminate their minds. As a divine
   being He was neither born nor did He die; He was only in outward
   appearance a man such as we are, in that He clothed Himself with a
   human body. His work consisted essentially in imparting the higher
   knowledge and the sacraments.

   5. A definite Soteriology. Redemption is effected by the liberation of
   man from the bondage of the lower gods, and by the due preparation for
   his return to his true home above. This liberation is brought about by
   the imparting of the superior wisdom, the removal of man's ignorance
   regarding his origin, his destiny, the hindrances in the road and the
   way to overcome them. Thereby the divine element in man, the Spirit,
   becomes self-conscious. Then the Christian has to prepare himself for
   his homeward journey, first by the reception of the sacraments and the
   seals, which will procure him a safe passage through all the hosts of
   hostile spirits, and next of ascetic practices, by the mortification of
   the flesh, of all that is the work of the demiurge. Occasionally an
   unbridled license took the place of this asceticism, both alike
   springing from the same root--dualism. Such is the course of man's
   redemption, at once intellectual, magical and physical.

   6. A definite view of the Church. That which the Christians usually
   call Church is not the Church of God at all. That Church consists of
   the number of the spiritual, i.e., of those who bring with them from
   the upper world the seed, the spiritual embryo. For them alone Christ
   appeared. They alone return after death into the kingdom of light. The
   aim of the Gnostic propaganda and of their conventicles is to gather
   them together and to awaken the slumbering divine life within them by
   imparting the higher mysteries to them. The natural inequality of man
   is presupposed. Whilst the Catholic Church in vain strives to remove
   this inequality by sending forth her missionaries, the Gnostic
   conventicles suffer Church and world to go to ruin, and reserve heaven
   for themselves.

   Such, in the barest outline, is the Gnostic theology. What is its
   source? According to the theory of the later anti-gnostic Fathers of
   the Church, Gnosticism arose by a wholesale rejection of Catholic
   theology. The Catholic Church, it is said, has always remained the
   same; it has never changed; it is only the heretics that have changed.
   There is a good deal that is true in this theory. On the whole,
   Catholicism is in the straight line of development from primitive
   Christianity. But the hypothesis that the Gnostics fell away from this
   unchangeable and fully developed Catholicism is altogether mistaken.
   Both Gnosticism and Catholicism can be traced to a common source--the
   theology and piety of the apostolic ages, which was neither Gnostic nor
   Catholic. Catholicism itself is in fact to a great extent only to be
   accounted for by the opposition to the Gnostic movement. There was a
   time when the two brothers, who were such deadly enemies later on,
   still lived at peace side by side, when the later Catholics themselves
   harboured a number of Gnostic ideas. For from the very first there was
   in the Church no lack of modes of thought and of feeling which later on
   spontaneously crystallized into Gnosticism.

   Where, now, do we find in primitive Christianity the starting-point,
   the source of the Gnostic movement?

   One thing is clear to begin with. The Jesus of history and the Jesus of
   Gnosticism have nothing whatever to do with each other. Although Jesus
   was placed in the centre of the Gnostic systems, He and His worshippers
   have no connection with each other. Speculation and mysticism are alike
   foreign to Jesus. His teaching never leaves the domain of the practical
   and the ethical, the problems of human life. He knows that He is
   surrounded by a world of spirits, but His curiosity is never directed
   towards that world. There is one occasional saying, related by St Luke,
   about the fall of Satan from heaven, and that only served to comfort
   the disciples.

   Even St Paul's Christology very seldom came into contact with the
   historical Jesus. What St Paul said about Jesus was really a myth--a
   drama to which Jesus gave His name. But then by the side of this St
   Paul declared the whole practical gospel of Jesus; he is a true
   disciple of the Lord in all his aims and ideals. Hence the great
   difference between him and the Gnostics. One point alone both alike
   confirm, viz., that the deepest speculations about Jesus offer us no
   kind of guarantee for true Christianity.

   Nevertheless points of contact with Gnosticism have been discovered by
   modern writers even in Jesus. The fact is instructive, for it shows us
   how deeply rooted Gnostic tendencies were even in the Church itself.

   1. Jesus had spoken in parables to the people. Why had He done so? For
   all Hellenistic Jews parables' were dark and mysterious sayings. The
   chief idea suggested by the word was something that needed explanation,
   problems that awaited solution. Hence the parables of Jesus were
   necessarily regarded as riddles and mysteries. That is the case
   throughout the New Testament. According to the Synoptists the mysteries
   of the kingdom of heaven are contained in the parables. The people are
   not meant to understand them, but even the disciples cannot; they are
   too difficult. It is only with the solution' of Jesus that the deeper
   knowledge of the parables begins. The evangelist Matthew appeals for
   the Greek word parables' to Ps. lxxviii. 2, where the parallel passage
   reads "things hidden from the commencement of the world." St John goes
   still further. It is only in parables and riddles that he makes Jesus
   speak to the disciples as well as to the people. The reason he gives
   for this is that as long as Jesus lived the understanding of the
   disciples did not attain to the level of the Master, and Jesus Himself
   therefore could not declare all as yet. These theories are not meant in
   a Gnostic sense. Neither St Mark nor St John mean that the parables of
   Jesus contain mysteries for the majority of Christians which perhaps
   only a chosen few understand. They only wished to emphasize the
   difference with which the disciples regarded and understood Jesus after
   the resurrection. It must be admitted, however, that we have here a
   point of departure for later Gnostic theories if once it were
   established that Jesus' words often or nearly always signified
   something else in addition to the apparent meaning. In fact, during the
   whole of the second century, the Church and the heretics completely
   agree as to the rationale of Jesus' use of parables. The difference
   between Catholics and Gnostics is entirely relative in this matter. The
   Gnostics take an earlier and a keener interest in the parables of
   Jesus, whilst the Catholics, e.g., Barnabas and Justin Martyr, show a
   preference for the Old Testament parables. Hence Irenaeus, to take one
   instance out of many, is really defenceless against the Gnostics; his
   only safety lies in appealing to the creed and in diverting attention
   from the mysterious to the simple and plain sayings of Jesus.

   2. A second point of contact was the difference observable in the inner
   circle of Jesus' disciples. In St Mark's Gospel, St Peter and the two
   sons of Zebedee appear in several places as the recipients of especial
   marks of love and of confidence. They alone, e.g., were eyewitnesses of
   His mysterious transfiguration, of which they were not to speak till
   after His resurrection. It was to them and to Andrew alone that Jesus
   revealed the future. They were Jesus' favoured disciples. What more
   easy to suppose than that Jesus had revealed to them many mysteries of
   which the rest of the disciples were ignorant? The transfiguration
   itself was a proof that He had done so. Here St Mark himself paved the
   way for Gnosticism by working upon this esoteric theory. He tells a
   story unknown to the majority of the apostles in Jesus' lifetime. The
   need for such secret traditions, based upon the authority of those most
   intimate with Jesus, must have been felt in an increasing degree in the
   sub-apostolic age. St John endeavoured to meet this need by the
   introduction of the great unknown--the disciple whom Jesus loved. The
   case is a somewhat peculiar one. He receives no special revelation, but
   merely supports the Fourth Gospel by his authority. Every special
   revelation is indeed denied by the theory of the Spirit. We see,
   therefore, that while the evangelist accepts the tendencies of his age
   he entirely recasts them at the same time. We may therefore conclude
   that it was the custom amongst many Christians thus to appeal to the
   highest available authority for secret traditions. Papias indirectly
   confirms this statement when he speaks of himself as going about from
   one aged Christian to another and inquiring what Andrew, Peter, Philip,
   Thomas, James, John and Matthew said. For the Church, however, the
   apostolic body as a whole took the place of all single favourites.
   After all, the difference is merely relative.

   3. In the next place a completely isolated and harmless saying of
   Jesus, the promise of the Spirit after His death, which St Mark is the
   first to record, came to acquire great importance. What Jesus meant was
   that His disciples who knew not how to speak should be empowered by a
   higher power to defend themselves in the law courts. Hence the opinion
   arose that the disciples should receive in the Spirit a substitute for
   Jesus and a continuance of His work. This opinion was capable of very
   different interpretations according to the conception formed of the
   Spirit. The Spirit was regarded either as the source of prophecy and
   the talking with tongues, or as the fount of knowledge and of the
   superior wisdom. If emphasis was laid on the latter, then the inference
   was that it was only after Jesus' death that His disciples had received
   the higher knowledge. Hence nothing was easier now than simply to
   derive from the Spirit any Christian doctrine for the origin of which
   no room could be found in the course of the life of Jesus--unless,
   indeed, another favourite course was followed, that of putting the
   doctrine into the mouth of the risen Lord. In the Fourth Gospel the
   Paraclete--so His Spirit is here called as the advocate of the
   disciples--is the giver of all higher knowledge. In the time of the
   earthly Jesus we do not meet with him. His existence only dates from a
   later time. From him, however, may be derived everything that rendered
   the deep and universal comprehension of Jesus possible. It is true that
   as "spirit of truth" he receives an orthodox colouring, and this, too,
   is orthodox that the Spirit is to teach nothing new. He is simply to
   remind the disciples of Jesus' teaching, but there is no formal
   difference between the higher wisdom of St John and that of all Gnostic
   revelations. Both supplement the history and the gospel of Jesus on the
   authority of the Spirit.

   4. Lastly, there was the unusually bold assertion that Jesus made in
   the feeling of His superiority over the Scribes, the official
   interpreters of God, "No one hath known the Father save the Son." Jesus
   appeared here to put forth His revelation as something absolutely new
   and not to be compared with anything that had gone before. It seemed as
   though the whole of the Old Testament had been laid aside. In the
   Gospel of St John Jesus declares to the Jews that their God is not His
   Father but the devil. The Jewish monotheistic faith must have been held
   in very low esteem by this author, for he says that only he that
   honoureth the Son honoureth the Father. It is true that sentences such
   as these, which originated in the controversy with the Jews, were very
   far indeed from being intended to bear the Gnostic meaning which they
   appeared to possess. John fully accepts the Old Testament as a divine
   revelation, and therefore the connection with Old Testament history.
   Only his theory is that it is not God the Father but the Son of God,
   the Logos Christ, who appeared to patriarchs and prophets, and that
   they were therefore Christians, after all, before Christ. Following on
   these lines Justin explains the saying of Jesus to mean that the Jews
   did not recognize either the Father or the Son, because they did not
   know that He who spoke with Moses was the Son of God and not the
   Father. This again is far from being Gnostic. But how easy it was,
   nevertheless, to base the watchword, "the new God and the new
   revelation," upon this saying of Jesus. What more natural than to say,
   "The God of the Jews was known before Jesus, therefore He was not the
   God whom Jesus alone revealed." The God of the Old Testament is not the
   Father of Jesus Christ.

   But with the exception of these four points the teaching of Jesus
   presents no points of contact with Gnosticism whatever. Nor have we
   here the real starting-point of the Gnostic movement. Our former
   statement holds good: Jesus and the Gnostics have nothing to do with
   each other. But when once the current towards Gnosticism had set in, it
   was possible to find a place for Jesus subsequently in the Gnostic
   theology as we have shown above. The process began as soon as the
   Synoptic Gospels had been accepted by the Gentile Churches. Since the
   common stock of the Synoptists apprehended no danger from Gnostic
   sources, while the Johannine writings are full of such indications, the
   decisive turn must have taken place in the two last decades of the
   first century between the composition of St Mark's Gospel and that of
   St John.

   The extent to which St Paul paved the way for Gnosticism was altogether
   different. In his soteriology, his anti-Jewish apologetics, his gnosis,
   there are numberless points from which the Gnostic movement may have
   started.

   1. The source of the Pauline soteriology is the hypothesis of the
   entire corruption of the world. The solution that matter itself is the
   abode of evil is a natural inference from the Pauline theory of the
   flesh. His theory of the Fall rent God and the present world asunder,
   and gave the latter a certain independence of its own. His theory of
   the Spirits enthroned Satan as the god of this world, at any rate spoke
   of him in a dualistic fashion. St John and Ignatius followed in the
   same direction; for them, too, the devil is the Prince of this world.
   And for St John, as for St Paul, the cosmos is something independent,
   something decadent, that needs salvation and yet is capable of it only
   to a certain degree: Jesus prays not for this world. Flesh and Spirit
   are opposed to each other as two hostile worlds. The Incarnation of the
   Logos did, it is true, make all dualistic inferences in reality
   impossible, yet these inferences could be drawn, and they were drawn. A
   further direct result was the distinction of the Creator of the world
   from the God of Jesus. This in itself crowns the pessimism of this
   system. Practically, too, Paul prepared for this result by the position
   which he took up with regard to the question of sex.

   St Paul's Christology contains in the germ all the principal features
   of the Gnostic development. Jesus is called the Redeemer (Soter). He is
   a being whose origin is not to be sought in the lower world at all, but
   in heaven. His nature is heavenly. In heaven He existed before all
   time, until He suffered Himself to be humbled, and emptied Himself of
   the Pleroma. Now He became man. Yet His humanity was something foreign
   and strange, alien to His true nature. Hence the fashion' or
   similitude' of the body of sin, of the man, in which He appeared. How
   easy, how natural it was to draw the Docetic conclusion! It would have
   been strange indeed if it had not been drawn. After a short time He
   ascended again to heaven after He had conquered the demons. His work as
   Saviour consisted in the revelation of the God of Love and the
   manifestation of the other world.

   St John applies these Pauline theories to the Gospel narrative. Here,
   too, Jesus is the Soter whose dwelling-place is heaven, who came down
   from thence and has returned thither. He alone is from above. We all
   are from below. Yet in St John's writings the humiliation of Christ is
   not carried out completely. Even upon earth the Soter manifested all
   the power of His heavenly glory, and thereby revealed the hidden God.
   His work is to save men from the cosmos, to reveal the unknown God to
   them, and to grant them everlasting life. All this presupposes the
   consistent Pauline pessimism. But how nearly related is the Johannine
   Christ to Docetism. He needs neither to eat nor to drink. It is His to
   die or not as He likes. He looks into every human heart. He performs
   many divine miracles. He is miraculously delivered. Here we have
   inferences strictly drawn, not from the idea of the Logos, but from the
   heavenly divine origin of Jesus as a whole. It is evident that for the
   Christology of St John the Parousia and, generally speaking, the
   eschatological element, are almost entirely absent. At most there will
   be one thing left for the Redeemer to do, that He should fetch us home
   to the world on high. In reality, as a member of the Christian Church,
   John held very different opinions. In the Gospel he is writing as a
   learned man.

   The Pauline soteriology, in the narrower sense of the word, is already
   marked by very strong Gnostic tendencies. The Spirit is the agent upon
   whom everything depends. St Paul makes the Spirit to be the gift of God
   or of Christ, which only those receive who believe in the Soter.

   Salvation consists in the reception and in the growth of the Spirit.
   But the Spirit is restricted to certain media, as, e.g., the Church and
   the Sacraments above all others. By means of the Church and the
   Sacraments the Christian receives a new accession of strength from
   above, and he himself helps to prepare a fit dwelling-place for the
   Spirit by a mortification of the passions which is often almost
   ascetic. Even now the Christian is a new creature, risen from the dead,
   a member of the body of Christ. It is only St Paul's eschatological
   teaching, however, that completes the process: thereby the flesh is
   entirely subdued and the spirit returns to its home, for flesh and
   blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.

   St Paul's successor, St John, holds essentially the same theory as to
   redemption. The beginning of the new life is the new birth, the birth
   from above--the passing from death unto life, and the end is the return
   to the world above. Only St John does not ascribe nearly as much to the
   agency of the Spirit, while all that man can and ought to do himself is
   thoroughly emphasized. Here we have already the reaction from the
   exaggerated theory of the Spirit put forward by the Gnostics.
   Nevertheless the new life is described, as it was later by Valentinus,
   as the victory over the world and liberation from its snares. The
   Christian looks forward with longing to the completion of this victory.
   Baptism is the means whereby we receive the birth from above; the
   Lord's Supper brings us heavenly food and strengthens the new life.
   Expressions which strongly remind us of the Gnostic writings are to be
   met with on almost every page: God dwells in Christians and they are in
   God. God and Christ together come and take up their abode in the soul
   of a truly pious man. Just as the Gnostics said, "We neither sin now,
   nor have we sinned," so St John declares, "He that is born of God,
   cannot sin; for God's seed, the Spirit, dwells in him." The devil dare
   not touch him at all. We are of God and the whole world lieth in
   wickedness. However great the vehemence with which St John engages in
   the struggle against the Gnostics, it must be admitted that the
   expressions which he employs are often practically indistinguishable
   from those of his adversaries.

   The final development of the Pauline pessimism is the doctrine of the
   creator of the world who is not identical with the highest God. So,
   again, the Pauline Christology ends in Docetism, and his teaching that
   we are saved by the Spirit is a soteriology which is at once physical
   and magical, while the evolution of his eschatology consists in the
   denial of the resurrection of the body. These are, of course,
   developments which St Paul himself would have utterly repudiated, and
   it is the easiest thing in the world to refute them by means of his
   epistles. All that is best, all the Christian elements in the Pauline
   theology, are opposed to Gnosticism. But for all that, the Pauline
   soteriology contained a powerful Gnostic leaven. The delight in
   speculation, mysticism, asceticism, even magic, found abundant material
   therein. The development which the Pauline theology experienced at the
   hands of St John is a proof how strongly Gnostic tendencies, based upon
   St Paul's writings, had influenced the very Christians who were engaged
   in the struggle against Gnosticism. The difference between the Gnostics
   and St John is often merely this: that St John had not the courage to
   draw the logical conclusion from his own statements.

   2. St Paul's anti-Jewish apologetics would also be likely to strike
   many as incomplete and standing in need of further consistent
   development. Paul had rejected the Jewish law, and had at the same time
   declared it to be divinely inspired. Such a position could not be
   maintained permanently. Did not St Paul himself emphasize the
   fact--when it suited him--that the law had been given by angels, and
   was closely related to the elements of the world? In other words, the
   law is not to be ascribed to the good God. Barnabas--a teacher of the
   Church--went so far as to refer the literal keeping of the law to a
   temptation of the devil. At the same time he denied that God had
   concluded a covenant with the Jews. In St John's Gospel Jesus always
   speaks of your,' i.e., of the Jew's law. All this produced the theory
   which separated the God of the law and the Father of Jesus Christ.
   Jesus' own positive position towards the law pointed, it is true, in
   another direction. Many indications, however, furnished by the
   Synoptists caused distinctions to be made in the law itself. At any
   rate in its literal sense the ceremonial law could not be derived from
   the highest God.

   A practical antinomianism was the result. Everything depends upon Faith
   and Love and the Spirit. All else is secondary. There is no law for the
   Christian, and nothing is forbidden. Christians are quite free; all is
   permitted them. Text after text taken from St Paul's writings, but
   without the context, of course, seems to countenance libertinism. And
   this libertinism could be understood either in a refined or in a coarse
   sense.

   In the course of his controversy with the Jews, St Paul had set up the
   doctrine of a twofold Predestination, setting up a direct contradiction
   for thought therein. It was asserted that one and the same God had
   created vessels of wrath and vessels of mercy. This was incredible. A
   twofold predestination presupposes a twofold God--the saved imply a God
   of mercy, the lost a God of wrath.

   Now in St Paul's writings there were frequent references to those that
   were of the flesh and those that were of the Spirit. The latter class
   had received their spiritual endowment from the God of the Christians;
   but who had assigned to the former their evil lot? St Paul gave no
   answer to that question. What more natural than to suppose a different
   origin, a different God for the fleshly man? The new thought of
   predestination is immediately connected with the idea of the two
   classes of men.

   This connection is best seen in St John's writings. His thoughts are
   those of a strict predestinarian, but at the same time they have a
   dualistic colouring. There are children of God and children of the
   devil. The origin of both is transcendental, from everlasting. The
   Spirit is the seed, the germ which the child of God brings from the
   world above. Henceforth there can be no moral freedom. Nevertheless St
   John champions the cause of freedom and rejects dualism. He claims to
   be on the side of the apologists and not of the Gnostics. He is
   unshaken in his belief that there is a transition from death unto life,
   from the flesh to the Spirit, by means of the miracle of conversion.
   Thereby he eliminates the aristocratic and deterministic flavour from
   the theory of the two classes of mankind. He does not think as a
   Gnostic, even though he sometimes speaks as one.

   3. It was through his Gnosis, however, that St Paul exercised the
   strongest influence of all on the new tendency which is named after it.
   We have to take into account here not only the form of this Gnosis, its
   definition, and the determination of its relation to faith, but also
   the contents, the angelological and Christological speculations that
   were the results of the inspired exegesis.

   The Pauline Gnosis has been defined as the revealed understanding of
   revelation. Three characteristic features are to be noted: it counts
   higher than faith; it is the property of single individuals; its source
   is in the Spirit. Exactly the same conception of the essential nature
   of Gnosis is to be found in the ecclesiastical teachers of the
   sub-apostolic age, e.g., in the writers of the Epistles to the Hebrews
   and of Clement and Barnabas. It may be objected, indeed, that they
   emphasize the fact that all Christians ought to possess Gnosis, since
   all have been endowed with the Spirit. But an examination of these
   writings proves conclusively that the authors felt themselves in an
   especial degree to be the representatives of the higher knowledge as
   compared with their readers who were being educated up to it. The
   classical passage for the ecclesiastical conception of Gnosis is
   contained in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   "Of Melchizedek we have many things to say and hard of interpretation,
   seeing ye are become dull of hearing. For when by reason of the time ye
   ought to be teachers, ye have need again that someone teach you the
   rudiments of the beginning of the word of God, and are become such as
   have need of milk and not of solid food. For every one that partaketh
   of milk hath no understanding in the word of righteousness; for he is a
   babe. But solid food is for the perfect, even those who by practice
   have their senses exercised to discern good and evil. Therefore we will
   leave the word of the beginning of Christ and press on unto perfection,
   not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of
   faith towards God, of the teaching of baptisms and of laying on of
   hands, and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment." No
   mention is here made of the Spirit. The author, who has been trained by
   Philo, follows a scientific method of exegesis, which almost assumes
   the place of inspiration for him. The proud exaltation, however, of
   Gnosis above faith, and of the teacher of perfection above the ignorant
   multitude, can be traced very plainly. There is no difference between
   ecclesiastical and Gnostic teachers as regards the essential nature of
   Gnosis and of the position which it should occupy.

   Another point is to be noticed. The ecclesiastical teachers exercised
   their skill in distinguishing the double meaning of Scripture on the
   Old Testament. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews does this by
   contrasting, as Plato would have done, between the idea and its copy in
   the world of phenomena. For him the whole of the Old Testament order of
   things has merely the value of such a copy or shadow. The application
   of this method to the words of Jesus and to the writings of St Paul
   cannot as yet be traced in ecclesiastical teachers. And yet it existed
   as a matter of fact when Jesus in the Fourth Gospel is made to speak
   almost exclusively in parables. The Gnostic teachers therefore
   introduced no new principle in applying the Platonic methods of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews to the objects of the Christian faith. In fact,
   it was only by this means that a certain obscurity in the relation of
   Gnosis to faith was removed. It is not the same object which is
   presented to faith as folly and to Gnosis as wisdom. Faith merely sees
   the copy, the appearance. It is only Gnosis that grasps the original in
   the world of spirit. That is the later Valentinian method, and the
   Church was powerless against it, for it had already surrendered on the
   question of principle. The first germs of the method may possibly be
   discovered even in St John's writings. Are not baptism and the Lord's
   Supper there considered to be the types of higher truths, the birth
   from above and the feeding with the Logos? The miracles are not merely
   signs of the Messiah's power, but also allegories of spiritual ideas:
   e.g., the healing of the man born blind, and the raising of Lazarus.
   The death of Jesus appears to signify the judgment upon Jesus; in
   truth, it is the judgment upon the devil. The great allegories that we
   find in Valentinus of the life of Jesus and of the cross of Paul are
   chiefly developed from these germs. The only difference is that John
   attaches a certain importance to the verbal signification of the
   narrative, whereas the later Gnostics reject it altogether.

   But the contents of the Pauline Gnosis exercised an important influence
   on the development of the heresy. The Gnosis was to be the revealed
   exegesis of the Old Testament. As a matter of fact, it revealed a
   number of things which had but a very slight connection with the Old
   Testament. It read out of the Scriptures a great supernatural story of
   Christ and of the spirits, discovered the mysteries of the fall, of the
   struggle between the good and evil spirits and their reconciliation,
   set up Jesus and His cross as the centre, the sun of the world of
   spirits, formed the conceptions of the fulness (Pleroma) and the
   emptying (Kenosis) of the Godhead in Christ. The union, too, of Christ
   and the Church, the pattern of marriage, St Paul discovered in the Old
   Testament. It can be proved that these angelological and Christological
   speculations seriously engaged the attention and deeply stirred the
   imagination of the Church. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
   and Hermas, employ methods which are almost diametrically opposed, but
   their end is the same--the definition of Christ's position towards
   angels and archangels. Both assign to Him the central position in the
   realm of spirits. Turning to St John, we find a passage of especial
   importance in the conversation of Jesus with Nicodemus. "If I told you
   earthly things and ye believe me not, how will ye believe if I tell you
   heavenly things?" The Christian, therefore, has a revealed
   knowledge--given him either by Christ or the Spirit--of the heavenly
   world, as a part of which we must certainly reckon the conviction that
   Satan is the father of the unbelieving Jews and that he has fallen from
   heaven. A passage in the letter of Ignatius to the Trallians looks
   exactly like an exposition of these words of St John. The heavenly
   things are the goal of Christian knowledge. Amongst these we must
   reckon the rank and order of the angels and the hosts of the Archons,
   both the visible and invisible, and all in relation to Christ and the
   Cross. For it is only faith in the blood of Jesus that makes even
   angels and spirits blessed. The whole of this superior wisdom, however,
   seems to be too exalted even for an Ignatius, not to speak of the
   simpleminded in the congregation, upon whom it could not fail to
   exercise a baneful influence. Here we have a test for the contents of
   the ecclesiastical Gnosis. It is essentially akin to that of the
   heretics.

   St Paul cannot, in fact, be acquitted of the charge of having very
   greatly furthered the Gnostic movement. Things crept into Christianity
   through his instrumentality which are nowhere to be found in Jesus'
   teaching: there were speculations of the wildest nature, which lightly
   passed over every obstacle in the spirit-world; mysticism was
   introduced in the doctrine of the indwelling Christ or Spirit; while
   celibacy was exalted, the libertine could find phrases which afforded
   him a handle to justify his excesses, and wisdom was held in high
   esteem, from a wish to find some compromise with the Greeks. More
   important than all these details is the general tendency of his system,
   his dualism which sets church and world, Adam and Christ, flesh and
   spirit, mind and spirit, will and grace, in absolute opposition to each
   other, the only link between them being the God who governs the whole
   drama of the world. At bottom, however, St Paul's nature was entirely
   alien to Gnosticism. He was a churchman in the widest and best sense of
   the word. Unlike the majority of the Gnostics, he did not think that
   the things of the Spirit were meant to be enjoyed in selfish,
   aristocratic exclusiveness. They should contribute their meed of
   service to social progress. High above all speculations and sentiments
   stood righteousness, love, the spirit of service, and self-control. He
   regards even the wildest theories as means to further quiet work in the
   social life of the community. As soon as ever there was a chance of
   helping the brethren, he forgot his own soul, together with all selfish
   religious enjoyment. Freedom of the conscience and the glory of
   knowledge are secondary considerations where weak and anxious souls are
   in distress. That is the bright reverse of St Paul's ecclesiastical
   character. And it was just this sense that he had of the social side of
   Christianity which enabled him to maintain an altogether different
   relation to the world than that with which the Gnostics were
   acquainted. The world is for him the missionary's field, the soil given
   by God in which the Church is to be planted. It belongs to God just as
   much as the Church. It is one and the same God who placed us in this
   world and redeemed us into the kingdom of His Son. In opposition to the
   Gnostic heretics at Colossae, St Paul maintains that things visible and
   in visible, world and church, have their centre in Christ. For this
   truly catholic broad-mindedness he reaped his reward. In spite of all
   the boasting of the Gnostics about their Paul, the Church did not waver
   in her allegiance to her Founder.

   But from this we infer that Gnosticism certainly cannot be derived from
   St Paul in the straight line of descent, however much later Gnostic
   teachers appealed to him. They made use of the apostle, and appealed to
   his authority, but he was not their ultimate source. No Gnostics
   whatever were personal scholars of St Paul. Their relation of
   dependence upon him only dates from the circulation of the Pauline
   letters among the Churches--i.e., from about the nineties of the first
   century. By the reading of his letters they were then confirmed in
   convictions which they had formed already.

   Now if Gnosticism can neither be derived from Jesus, with whom it has
   nothing in common, nor directly from St Paul, to whom the
   ecclesiastical and anti-gnostic features are no less prominent than
   those which furthered Gnosticism, then it can only be explained by the
   influence of foreign elements upon Christianity. Gnosticism arose
   through the absorption of Christianity in its earliest days into the
   great syncretism of all religions. Jewish, Babylonian, Persian, Syrian,
   Egyptian, Greek influences stormed in upon the Christian faith in its
   infancy, and produced those curious Gnostic conglomerates which belong
   rather to the general history of religion than to that of the early
   days of Christianity.

   Of all these influences the Jewish must at first have been the most
   powerful. The heretical teachers, against whom the author of the
   Pastoral epistles and Ignatius take up arms, are described by them as
   Judaizing. Hegesippus tells us that the Gnostics spring from Jewish
   sects. The great arch-heretic of the later fathers, Simon Magus, was a
   half Jew, a Samaritan, and the Gnostic sources of the
   pseudo-Clementines which are directed against him are likewise to be
   traced to a Jewish-Christian milieu. None of these men, in fact, were
   strict Jews like those Judaizers, e.g., who intrigued against St Paul.
   The official, rabbinical Judaism excommunicated such Gnostic Jews just
   as much as the Christians. They were the representatives of a Jewish
   faith which had itself succumbed to foreign influences.

   It is easily conceivable how Jews, adherents apparently of the most
   exclusive and firmly established of religions, suffered themselves to
   be drawn into this universal ma√´lstrom of religions. The distinctive
   feature of the Jewish character is something purely practical, the
   strict retention of the national law. The conception of dogma in the
   usual sense of the word did not exist here at all. Men were free to
   believe what they liked, and there were therefore no doctrinal
   disputes. The most varied phantasmagorias concerning the future life
   were taken up into the Apocalyptic. It admitted Greek fancies as to
   hell as readily as Babylonian dragon-myths or Persian ideas as to
   resurrection. There was nothing to prevent any eschatology whatever
   from being accepted. So, too, the main portion of the belief in angels
   was imported from Persia and Babylonia. Actual dualistic statements
   seemed to pass unnoticed, and the rigid monotheistic belief was
   modified by theories as to intermediary beings, the word, the metatron,
   the Schechinah. In many of its writings the New Testament is itself a
   witness for the disintegration of the Jewish faith. The existence of a
   monastic order such as that of the Essenes proves to us that such
   foreign fancies were able in the end to transform everyday life as
   well, and to compete with the national law. Thus the way was paved for
   the rise of Gnosticism in the heart of Judaism. Gnosticism was at the
   door, as soon as the national law began to fall into desuetude through
   conclusions drawn from foreign speculations, as soon as the foreign
   element began to oust the national in practice as well as in theory.
   The sources of the pseudo-Clementines afford us the best insight into
   this decomposition of Judaism. We can here see what portions of the Old
   Testament could no longer be accepted by the Jews--the instances of
   anthropomorphism in the mention made of God, the grievous taints that
   disfigured the lives of the patriarchs; above all, the ceremonial law
   involving the shedding of blood for the sacrifices. In this last point
   they agree with the Essenes, in others they harmonize with the line of
   development of the Scribes themselves. But by the side of this
   opposition to the old a need was very soon felt for new objects of
   worship and a closer fellowship. Through sacred ablutions, unctions and
   meals, they separate themselves from the rest of the community and form
   a little circle of the initiated. Here alone the cabala is handed down
   of prophets and prophetesses who alternately traverse the field of
   history and deliver oracles, and the cabala of the true prophet,
   Adam--Christ, who is incarnate under various names and shapes, and who
   reveals to us what is eternal and good in the Old Testament and what is
   temporal and not divine. But this new element, this doctrine of the
   sacraments and the mysteries, is no longer to be derived from Judaism
   itself, since it destroys the chief characteristic of the Jewish
   religion, the connection between God and His people.

   Hence the ultimate origin of Gnosticism is to be sought beyond Judaism.
   It is an alien element in Judaism itself, derived partly from
   Babylon--hence the roll assigned to the Seven, the gods of the
   constellations in the oldest cosmogonies, partly from Persia--hence the
   good God, the Saviour of men from the might of the tyrants, the gods of
   the constellations. First of all, these two religions, the Babylonian
   and the Persian, met and produced the idea of the enslavement of the
   soul through the fateful power of the lower tyrants, and of its
   liberation and its ascent up above all the stars to the good God of
   light. Then these ideas firmly established themselves in Jewish hands.
   The God of the Jews, the creator of the world, had to submit to be
   degraded and Himself to become the first of the tyrants. The fact that
   the Jewish national God is the demiurge in all Gnostic systems, proves
   that Gnostic doctrines travelled to Christianity by way of Judaism.
   Nothing was more natural for Christians, when they heard this esoteric
   teaching, than to assign the roll of the redeemer to their Lord Jesus.
   He thus occupied the same central position in these speculations as He
   had already obtained in the theology of St Paul. It was discovered that
   the Pauline anti-Jewish soteriology after all expressed pretty much the
   same truth as the new Gnostic doctrines, though the consequences were
   not drawn quite so strictly. People like Simon Magus, however, assigned
   to themselves the principal role in the Gnostic system. For Simon
   declared that the unknown God appeared amongst the Jews as the Son,
   amongst the Samaritans as the Father, and amongst the Gentiles as the
   Holy Ghost, placing himself thereby above Jesus as surely as the Father
   is higher than the Son.

   Finally, these Gnostico-Babylonian-Jewish-Christian ideas made their
   way to the Greek Christians. It was then that they were purified and
   clarified by Greek philosophy. The difference is noticeable when the
   systems of Valentinus and his scholars are compared with the
   speculations of other Gnostics such as the Ophite sects. Even the
   highest systems betray their barbaric origin, but yet they approach,
   and that very nearly, to the tendency prevalent amongst the cultured
   classes which was making for neoplatonism. It was only through these
   esoteric Gnostic doctrines that Christianity was rendered accessible to
   many educated Greeks. Hitherto Christianity had appeared to them to be
   of purely indigenous Jewish growth. The Jewish anthropomorphic God,
   Jesus the crucified as Saviour, the grossly material Jewish
   Apocalyptic, were all mere idle dreams and fancies for intellectual
   Greeks. They now learnt of a purer higher conception of the divinity,
   of the death on the cross as apparent merely, of a heavenly world
   without flesh and blood, painted in purely spiritual colours. The
   Oriental mythology of the Gnostics proved to be nearer akin to Greek
   philosophy than the system of ideas of early Christianity which
   reckoned with the hard facts of history. We know, it is true, that a
   very strong current had set in towards Hellenism in ecclesiastical
   Christianity as well. But Gnosticism hastened this process.

   But to these three influences--the Jewish, the Babylonian-Persian, the
   Greek, each of which can clearly be recognized--we must not forget to
   add a vast importation of superstition and chimeras from every corner
   of the chaos of peoples inhabiting the then-known world. There was a
   truly international element in the Gnostic religion. Incantations of
   all kinds, the love of the mysteries, both old and new, a universal
   ascetic ideal of saintliness, and side by side with it bestial
   aberrations, every occult science, every variety of swindling, are all
   bound up with the esoteric doctrines of Gnosticism, which are not
   altogether lacking in elevation. The profoundest reflections end in
   merely childish or abstruse speculations. The first present which the
   chaos of peoples hastened to give to the new religion was every scrap
   of religious mystery which could be collected together.

   The circumstances of the time were exceedingly favourable to the rise
   of Gnosticism.

   We must picture this earliest age of the Church as one in which men
   were perfectly free to think and to teach whatever they wished. Only
   one dogma was necessarily imposed--Jesus is the Lord, or Redeemer.
   Everything else was left to the inspiration of the individual. The
   Spirit was richly poured out upon prophets and prophetesses, upon
   teachers of all kinds. This is the reason why theological conceptions
   had not as yet crystallized. True, the Old Testament canon was shared
   with Judaism, but one had not as yet definitely ascertained what
   belonged to it and what did not, and the rabbinical exegesis which had
   formed a barrier against the Gnostics was rejected. Jesus Himself had
   differentiated certain portions of the law--at least such was the
   universal opinion--and St Paul had declared the law to be annulled. How
   could the Old Testament, then, possibly continue to be regarded as an
   authority? Certain practical maxims were, it is true, generally
   accepted, such, e.g., as were afterwards formulated in the apostles'
   decree. Yet even here there were notable exceptions--Paul had not
   followed the apostolic injunctions in the matter of meat offered to
   idols. At any rate, in the sphere of dogma there was the same absolute
   absence of all restriction as prevailed in Judaism. Gnosticism arose at
   a time when the apostles, prophets and teachers were still the leading
   personalities in the Church, and every one of these inspired persons
   exercised a very widely-spread influence. It would seem that in the
   oldest time the propagators of Gnosticism were almost without exception
   men of this character. They were workers of magic, performers of
   miracles, prophets and prophetesses. Hence the amazing rapidity with
   which their esoteric teaching spread; hence, too, the authority which
   they exercised, and the defencelessness of many Christians against
   them. For it was nothing new that they professed to be teaching. They
   merely claimed to possess the especial understanding of revealed truth
   like every other Christian teacher. As long as this freedom existed,
   there was nothing to prevent Christianity being deluged by foreign
   religions.

   There is an additional factor, however, the consideration of which is
   essential to a right understanding of the genesis of Christian
   Gnosticism. Gnosticism did not merely force its way into Christianity
   from outside; it arose in the midst of the congregations as well. Its
   origin is to be looked for in connection with the influx of the Pagan
   masses into the Christian congregations and the reaction that was
   occasioned thereby, leading to the formation of more restricted circles
   of people of holy life as a protest against the Christianity of the
   masses. Even as far back as St Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians
   we have a remarkable picture of the curious composition of an early
   Christian congregation and the great differences within it. These
   Christian Corinthians were for the most part the offscourings of the
   big cities, the most degraded and sunken elements of the population.
   Nor did this state of things change speedily. The congregations were
   for a long time to come mostly recruited from the lowest ranks of
   society. From an intellectual point of view they must be conceived of
   as exceedingly rude and superstitious, and morally they were far below
   the ideal of St Paul. The Church had flung her doors wide open for them
   that were without, and had made the conditions of salvation for the
   individual very easy at his entrance. We cannot feel surprised,
   therefore, that this invitation was accepted by very large numbers.
   Thus from the very earliest times a Christianity of the masses, an
   average Christianity, was gradually developed, called by St Paul carnal
   and childish, which was nevertheless to be assured of everlasting life
   and the future kingdom of God. But now the First Epistle to the
   Corinthians shows us likewise that from the very first there were a
   number of strong, educated and enlightened Christians who were raised
   above the common herd. "We all have knowledge" was their favourite
   motto. To this group belonged also the followers of Apollos, who looked
   for wisdom and intellectual perfection in Christianity as though it
   were one of the mysteries. But these enlightened men could also be
   ascetics, for it seems that the freedom to eat of meat offered to
   idols, and the demand for entire continence in marriage, applied to the
   same group of people at Corinth. Little circles, therefore, of
   Christians who aimed at a higher ideal of sanctity and of knowledge by
   the side of the great bulk of the congregations, were a characteristic
   feature of our religion from the very first. As time went on the chasm
   between the two widened. The more merely average Christianity made its
   way into the Church, the greater the need for closer combination felt
   by those Christians who fancied themselves in possession of a higher or
   at any rate of a different kind of ideal. The fact that these
   enlightened Christians would in our estimation often simply be a little
   less superstitious than the others, does not affect the case. They
   thought themselves to be of a higher order, even if their only
   prerogative was the possession of a new charm.

   We here come across a curious contradiction. These narrower circles of
   the initiated and illuminated were the first to succumb to the attacks
   of an increasing worldliness. Their secret doctrines, as well as their
   sacraments and their ethics, came from outside sources, from the great
   chaos of heathen religions. That which they set forth as a higher
   Christianity and a progress in knowledge is, from our point of view,
   the decomposition and dissolution of the Gospel into a heathen
   syncretism--a confused mass of superstitions and philosophies. They
   themselves, however, usually, if not always, regarded their work, on
   the contrary, as a reaction. Marcion was not the only one to proclaim
   the watchword, "Back to Paul; back to all that is original and
   genuine." Nearly all the Gnostic schools advanced the claim to a better
   and purer knowledge of Jesus and Paul than the Church of their day,
   based as it was on a spirit of legalism and tradition. This Church
   appeared to them to be too wide, too universal, too much a Church of
   the world and of sinners. Surely this could not be the Church which
   claimed to be the body of Christ, the fellowship of the elect, of the
   saints, of the spiritual. A blind, blunt, traditional faith, worldly
   ethics, a sensual, Jewish hope for the future world: such appeared to
   be her characteristics. This Church was the world, the fellowship of
   the unredeemed, of natural men. In contrast to this Church, the
   Gnostics form their narrower circles and gather the saints into their
   conventicles, where they impart to them the higher initiation, and
   reveal to them the higher knowledge by which alone the Christian truly
   becomes such. Gnosticism thus regarded--and such it was in its own
   estimation--denotes the first great reaction in the Church, the first
   Puritan movement directed against the worldly Church.

   It is only after taking considerations such as these into account that
   the relation of Gnostic theology to Paulinism becomes clear. There can
   be no doubt that St Paul did not originate the Gnostic movement; no
   single one of his own pupils could become a Gnostic. For St Paul the
   Catholic Church is the firm ground upon which he stands, the basis of
   his thoughts and work, the fervent love of his heart, the centre of all
   his speculations. The whole of his theology is an ecclesiastical
   dualism which divides the world into two halves--without Christ, with
   Christ; allotting death to the former, life to the latter, and yet
   keeping both together through God, the creator and ruler. It was when
   this standard of the Catholic Church was abandoned in favour of that of
   a mere sect that the Puritan-Gnostic theology was developed from St
   Paul's. And this was the critical moment in the evolution of
   Gnosticism; not the influx of foreign thoughts and rites, but the
   transference of the centre of gravity from the Church catholic into the
   little circle of the spiritual. Thereby the ecclesiastical dualism is
   transformed into an absolute, metaphysical dualism. God and the world
   fall altogether asunder, just as the spirit and the flesh, the spirit
   and reason. The spiritual alone are chosen by God to all eternity; all
   the rest of mankind, even including other Christians, are the children
   of the devil or of some inferior deity. Christ is not the redeemer of
   the world, but of the spiritual, who leads them back to the home from
   which they have come, the kingdom of light. This Gnosticism would, of
   course, have arisen even without St Paul; there were very many Gnostic
   sects which knew nothing whatever about him. But it never would have
   become such a spiritual power in the Church had it not conquered and
   adapted to its own purposes the dualistic soteriology of St Paul. Again
   and again in the later history of the Church a puritan or pietistic
   theology has arisen according to this same law, by an accentuation of
   the Pauline dualism and a contraction of the Church into a sect.

CHAPTER X.

  THE INTELLECTUAL STRUGGLE.

   THE first encounter between the Church and the Gnostic tendencies
   occurred while St Paul was still alive. Heretical teachers appeared at
   Colossae, who had already been engulfed in the great whirlpool of
   religions. They boasted of their Jewish circumcision and of their Greek
   philosophy, recommended angelolatry and ascetic practices. Paul
   combated them from the standpoint of his gnosis, and opposed practical
   Christian principles to their asceticism. We know nothing as to the
   further history of this Colossian sect. It was the advance guard of the
   invading army which attacked the Church on all sides in the last two
   decades of the first century, and is noticed in almost every
   contemporary ecclesiastical writing. The Pastoral and Johannine
   epistles (about 100 A.D.) are the earliest documents to give us a clear
   conception of their opponent's position. It is very instructive how
   quickly, after all, the consciousness of the difference between what
   was Christian and what was Gnostic was acquired. We see how the Pauline
   theology impelled even ecclesiastical teachers such as John, e.g., to
   travel very far in the direction of Gnosticism. Speculation was very
   highly esteemed. God and the world, the spirit and the flesh, were
   discussed in a dualistic fashion. In certain additions made to the
   Gospels a very near approach indeed was made to Docetism. But these
   very same representatives of the ecclesiastical Gnosis instinctively
   rejected anything that was Gnostic theology properly so-called. There
   is only one explanation of this. Their feeling for that which was and
   that which was not Christian, was on the whole too strong to be
   endangered by any speculations of a Gnostic tendency. This was
   fortunate for the Church, and honourable for these men. Their theology
   was a very incomplete reproduction of Christianity. The real Jesus
   fitted neither to the Jewish nor to the Greek formulae which they
   employed. But they had that personal Christianity which is patient of
   every kind of speculation--up to the point when it is itself
   threatened. When once this point is reached it is stirred into
   activity, and silences the theologian in the midst of his speculations.
   So it was now. The Church theologians themselves entered the lists
   against the Gnostics, and opposed their antithesis to every thesis
   brought forward by the latter. We can now clearly recognize which side
   preserves the true line of Christian succession in every point.

   1. The debate as to the first capital point, the principle of
   authority, was the most unfortunate The Gnostics proclaimed the
   supremacy of the Spirit. This implied the right of license and the
   victory of the non-Christian element over the Gospel. Had Christianity
   developed along the lines indicated by this theory, it would have
   disappeared altogether in the chaos of peoples. The Church's teachers,
   however, declared that the Spirit of Christ alone--i.e., the Christian
   tradition--was decisive. Nothing could be more sensible. Unfortunately
   ecclesiastical law was exclusively substituted for the Spirit in the
   process of the determination and limitation of the tradition. We shall
   have occasion to recur to this point when we discuss the forcible
   measures employed by the Church. But this is the place to mention
   another matter. The divinity of the Old Testament, even of the law, is
   maintained against the criticism of the Gnostics. It was the Old
   Testament to which the Gnostic spirit could least of all adapt itself.
   It was held in very low esteem, made out to be the work of a lower
   order of spirits, of the demiurge or even of Satan himself; and to
   establish their position they made use of apocryphal writings both old
   and new. It was felt, however, by the Church that the destruction of
   the Old Testament cut the ground from under the feet of the Christians
   and exposed them to every storm. There were additional weighty motives
   of a practical character. The proof from prophecy was needed for
   apologetic purposes, and for this the Old Testament writings were
   indispensable. And the defence of Christianity as of the old and lawful
   religion, was invalidated by the abandonment of the Old Testament. It
   was a difficult matter to defend the Old Testament as a Christian book
   at once against the Gnostics and the Jews. But this position was
   maintained. The author of the Pastoral epistles warns the bishops not
   to suffer the Old Testament to escape them through the perversions of
   the Gnostics. "Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for
   doctrine, for instruction, for reproof, for correction, for discipline
   which is in righteousness." He presupposes the Jewish doctrine of the
   inspiration of the Old Testament, and merely fights for the
   ecclesiastical utility of the book. But what is to be counted as
   belonging to the Old Testament? No very clear decision was reached as
   to this point. On the one hand, we find a disposition to submit to the
   judgment of the Jewish Rabbis at Jabne, whose canon of the Hebrew Old
   Testament exactly corresponds with our own. Hence certain Christian
   teachers began to reject the Apocrypha at a very early date. The author
   of the Second Epistle of St Peter, who copies the whole of the letter
   of St Jude, carefully omits or obliterates the quotations from the book
   of Enoch and the Ascension of Moses. Jerome's later statement, that
   many Christians rejected the letter of St Jude because of its
   quotations from the book of Enoch, agrees with this. People, however,
   like the author of the Second Epistle of St Peter were the exceptions
   in this first age. The great majority of the Christians possessed the
   Septuagint, and the canon set up by the Rabbis of Jabne did not apply
   here. Apocryphal Jewish writings must have been very extensively
   employed in the Church up to the time of Origen. There was the same
   absence of decision with regard to exegesis. In spite of Gnostic abuses
   of the practice, the right of allegorical interpretation was
   maintained. There was no saving the Old Testament without allegory. The
   best illustration of the lengths to which some went in this direction
   are to be found in the Epistle of St Barnabas, where he applies the red
   heifer to Christ, and the Gematry of Elieser, Abraham's three hundred
   and eighteen servants, to Jesus the crucified. The chief point was,
   however, gained: the Old Testament remained intact as a divine book and
   as the canon for the Church. In spite of all disastrous consequences,
   that was a fortunate event for the future history of mankind.

   2. The Gnostics separated the creator of the world from the redeemer.
   The Church maintained their unity. The creator is no inferior God, but
   the true and highest God, the redeemer. The author of the Pastoral
   epistles combats the Gnostic theory of the divinity by insisting on the
   unity of God and opposing asceticism. "Every creature of God is good.
   God has created meat and drink for the Christians, to be received by
   them with thanksgiving." It was clearly recognized in the Church that
   it was no mere matter of speculation. Had the Christian any right to
   believe in Providence? That was the issue at stake. Is God or the devil
   supreme in this world? Is the believer indebted for his life, his
   health, his natural powers, to the God that redeems him, or to an enemy
   of God? About the middle of the second century the old expressions "the
   devil, the prince of this world," etc., almost vanish from Christian
   writings. By a bold exegesis Irenaeus makes out that Paul never called
   Satan God of this world. And on the other hand, God appears in the
   creeds as creator of heaven and earth. At all costs the negative
   attitude to the world is to be avoided.

   3. The defence of "the resurrection of the flesh" against the purely
   spiritualistic eschatology of the Gnostics was a natural consequence of
   the belief in God the creator. The heresy that the Resurrection had
   already taken place is first met with in the Pastoral epistles, and
   both Polycarp and Justin make further mention of it. We may reasonably
   assume that the practical significance of this dogma--which was of
   Jewish origin--had been already realized, as it certainly was later by
   Irenaeus and Tertullian. The body belongs to the whole man such as he
   was created by God. Whoever denies the resurrection of the flesh
   thereby attacks the God of creation. An additional reason was the
   unwillingness to give up the Jewish eschatology. But the really
   decisive argument was the first. Much difficulty indeed was occasioned
   by St Paul's statement, that flesh and blood should not inherit the
   kingdom of God. Irenaeus tells us that it was the main support of the
   Gnostics; and even before this, Justin attempted to adapt the phrase to
   the creed of the Church in a book which has been lost. But the stories
   of the risen Lord appeared more important than words of St Paul. Here
   the theory of the resurrection of the flesh was actually realized.
   There is something truly magnificent in the way in which the martyrs go
   forth to death with the certainty that the God who created their body
   can likewise restore it.

   4. From eschatology we turn to Christology. Here the most valuable
   tenet, the humanity of Jesus, was protected against the Gnostics and
   their Docetic dissolvent. This Docetism appeared at a very early date
   as a natural consequence of the divinity' of Christ; nor was it
   confined in all probability to the Gnostic schools. It was opposed
   first of all by the author of the Pastoral epistles, who maintains the
   true humanity of Jesus, "One mediator between God and man--the man
   Christ Jesus." The author of the Johannine epistles has to do with
   opponents who deny that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, and who
   dissolve, as Cerinthus did, the nature of Jesus, i.e., distinguish
   between the heavenly Christ and the earthly Jesus. They also deny the
   blood, i.e., the death of Jesus. In opposition to these views John
   dwells upon the human body of Christ, upon His real death, and upon the
   unity in the nature of Jesus Christ the Redeemer. A little later we
   find the characteristic expressions of Docetism in use among the
   heretics, the adversaries of Ignatius: it was, the body in which Christ
   suffered was only a phantom. Everything human that is told us of Jesus,
   His Davidic Sonship, His birth, His eating and drinking, His death and
   resurrection, all His actions, were only in appearance. In opposition
   to this Ignatius takes his stand upon the statements of the creed, and
   to each he adds his verily.' Here again it is a practical interest for
   which the Church is struggling; is the personal assurance of salvation
   to rest upon a phantom or a reality? "Why," asks Ignatius,
   significantly, "why should I suffer myself to be cast to the lions for
   a faith which rests upon an illusion?" And here at least the Church had
   a very powerful ally in St Paul. His whole system fell to pieces, if
   its core and centre, the cross, was only a phantom. The reconciliation
   of the divinity of Christ with His humanity, that was so stoutly
   defended, causes no anxiety for the present. It is none other than
   Ignatius who speaks of Jesus by preference as God. The fact itself was
   all that was of importance. The way in which it was brought about was a
   question left for future generations to solve. We may at any rate
   thankfully acknowledge our debt of gratitude to these men. Had it not
   been for them, the historic Christ would have been entirely explained
   away.

   5. The physical soteriology of the Gnostics now has to make way for the
   moral and ecclesiastical doctrine of salvation. The Gnostics appealed
   to St Paul's doctrine of the Spirit. However one-sided and arbitrary
   the fashion in which they interpreted this, they were right in the main
   thought: the Christian is redeemed by the power of God coming over him.
   How important the Spirit was to them we may infer indirectly from the
   fact that salvation by the Spirit is completely thrust into the
   background both in the Pastoral letters and in that of St John. Through
   the latter we get to know a number of expressions current among the
   Gnostics: "I have known God; I am in the light; I dwell in God; I am
   born in God and God's seed dwells in me; I have passed from death unto
   life; I love God; the love of God is completed in me; we do not sin,
   neither have we sinned." Knowledge always occupies the first place; the
   second is assigned to mysticism as the fruit of knowledge, to the
   flight of the soul above all the world to God, and the indwelling of
   God in the soul. This ideal of piety was in nowise necessarily followed
   by licentious excess. Even in the case of noble and elevated souls it
   was, however, usually attended by the neglect and depreciation of
   simple morality, of love, and social duties. Ignatius excellently
   characterizes these religious epicures: "They care nothing for love,
   nothing for widows, nothing for orphans, nothing for the sick, nothing
   for prisoners or freed captives, nothing for them that hunger and
   thirst. They neglect the holy eucharist and the prayers of the Church."
   The temptation to indulge in this mystic and contemplative piety,
   appealing as it did so confidently to the words of the Apostle Paul,
   was very great, and that the Church resisted it with a like confidence,
   is a proof of its sober sanity. The authors of the Pastoral epistles
   and of the Johannine writings stand shoulder to shoulder in their zeal
   for the practical and ethical interpretation of the Gospel of Jesus, in
   their rejection of all speculations of mysticism and asceticism. Faith
   and love, says the pseudo-Paul, are the greatest things. Here we have
   the sound doctrine. All depends upon righteousness, faith, love and
   unity with one's brother Christians in the Church. Christians are to do
   good works, that is, praiseworthy and profitable to men. No Christian
   is to spend a fruitless life. Better a piety that is useful in many
   ways than an asceticism which profits but little. The First Epistle of
   St John contains the same thoughts, only they are expressed in the
   author's far more impressive and characteristic phraseology--How is a
   Christian to be recognized? If he keeps the commandments, if he does
   righteousness, if he loves the brethren. This is all that really
   matters. Knowledge and mysticism are empty phrases as soon as simple
   morality and love are wanting. But where love is, there is also
   knowledge and communion with God. As God cannot be the direct object of
   our love, we ought to show the love of God to the brethren. In both
   groups of letters the doctrine of salvation by the Spirit is thrust
   into the background; in the Pastoral epistles it is actually given up
   altogether, because it seriously threatened morality. The Church and
   the Sacraments take the place of the Spirit; in them the saving grace
   of God draws near to men. But, then, the Christian is himself to work
   and to labour, that the new life may be formed in him. A natural
   consequence of the emphasis thus laid upon morality was the defence of
   the freedom of the will which first Justin and then Irenaeus undertook.
   Henceforth nature and man's will were the watchwords. This antithesis
   corresponded to actually existing contrasts. The very existence of
   Christianity as the highest ethical religion was at stake.

   6. The last antithesis was the truest. Sect or Catholic Church--the
   gathering together of the spiritual, or the call to go forth and make
   disciples of all men. The Gnostics had withdrawn arrogantly from the
   Church. They had refused to take part in the life of the fellowship. We
   may infer from St John's First Epistle that they hated the brethren,
   i.e., the ordinary Christians; that they criticised and despised them,
   and gave themselves up exclusively to their mystic love of God.
   Ignatius says still more plainly: "Love is of no importance to them.
   They care nothing for widows or orphans, for the sick, or for them that
   are in bonds, for those set free, for them that hunger and thirst--they
   withdraw from the Eucharist and the prayer of the Church."

   As against such conduct the watchword is proclaimed: hold fast by the
   unity of the Church and follow zealously after love in the Church. St
   Paul himself gave out this watchword in his last letters, for a special
   congregation in the Epistle to the Philippians, and for the Church as a
   whole in the so-called letter to the Ephesians. "Forbear with one
   another in love; giving diligence to keep the unity of the spirit in
   the bond of peace. There is one body and one spirit, even as also ye
   were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one
   baptism, one God and Father of all." But this thought of unity receives
   its most impressive expression in the high priestly prayer in the
   Gospel of St John. The unity of the Church amidst the Gnostic storms is
   the aim of the whole of this prayer, the last testament of Jesus to His
   disciples. Four times Jesus repeats the petition, "That they may be
   one, even as we are one; I in them and thou in Me, that they may be
   perfected into one." But not the prayer alone: the last discourses of
   Jesus taken as a whole, with the magnificent parable of the vine and
   the branches which forms their centre, with the new commandment of the
   love of the brethren and the promise of the spirit of truth--all aim at
   this duty of ecclesiastical unity. The mere setting forth of the ideal
   without any direct polemic imparts their wonderful impressiveness to
   these admonitions. Hence we can understand why the love of the brethren
   receives such prominence in the First Epistle of St John, in the
   Pastoral epistles, and in Ignatius. It is not merely zeal for practical
   Christianity in accordance with the teaching of Jesus which is
   manifested therein--it is also zeal for ecclesiastical unity and
   ecclesiastical fellowship which is displayed in all the works of love
   enumerated by Ignatius. But however ardently this Church may close up
   its ranks and set forth unity as its aim, it excels the Gnostic sects
   in its wideheartedness and its universal democratic tendencies. Whilst
   the Gnostics limited salvation to the spiritual and claimed Christ for
   themselves, their ecclesiastical opponents, the authors of the Pastoral
   and Johannine epistles, are the advocates of universal salvation, of
   the equality of all men before God; God would have all men to be saved.
   Jesus is the redeemer of all men, the atonement for the whole world.
   So, too, they reject all the extra sacraments and the superior
   knowledge of the sectarians, and proclaim the equality of all
   Christians in knowledge and ripeness. For John, all such as believe are
   also such as have knowledge. "Ye have the unction of saints, and ye all
   know. Ye need not that anyone should teach you." And such, too, is the
   opinion of the author of the Pastoral letters. Faith is the knowledge
   of the truth. There is nothing higher than faith. Ignatius warns the
   Ephesians against the so-called sacrament of unction. "Why do we not
   then all become men of understanding, seeing we have received the
   knowledge of God, namely, Jesus Christ?" So the democratic character of
   Christianity is to be preserved; upon the broad basis of the faith no
   differences are recognized save those of advance or retrogression in
   the walk in righteousness.

   It was no insignificant or worthless portion of Christianity that the
   Church determined to defend at all costs against the Gnostics. Of
   course all that it defended was not of equal value. Christianity clings
   firmly to its foundation in the Old Testament. It carefully preserves
   the three articles in its creed which it took over from Judaism: the
   belief in God the creator, the central position of morality, the hope
   for the future. The struggle in which it likewise engaged for the
   sensuous Jewish eschatology and the rabbinical doctrine of inspiration
   was due to the special circumstances of the time, and did not do very
   much harm.

   In like manner the Church retained the best elements in the Gospel of
   Jesus: His promise and His claims, the fundamental democratic trait in
   His character, with His search for the light. On no single point is the
   Gospel of Jesus on the side of the Gnostics. And thus far the reproach
   of having fallen away from the Church was fully justified.

   The relation of the two contending parties to St Paul was, however,
   somewhat different. Both seized hold of a portion of his teaching; the
   Paul whom the Church finally retained was not the whole Paul, but one
   cut after an ecclesiastical pattern. It cannot be denied that the
   Gnostics understood many thoughts of St Paul better than the Church his
   pessimism, his eschatology, his thoughts of the spirit and of
   redemption. The complete understanding of the Pauline soteriology
   ceases in the Church after the Gnostic controversy. In opposition to
   the Gnostics far greater importance is attached to free will, to good
   works, and the body than was done by St Paul. Man's natural power and
   the force of character are estimated more highly, whilst the operations
   of the divine grace and of the Spirit are exclusively attached to the
   sacraments. With great tact, however, the Church discovered just what
   was of use to herself; it was at the same time that which was
   pre-eminently Christian--Faith, Love, the emphasis laid on works, the
   connection with the Old Testament. Nor can there be any doubt as to the
   side on which St Paul would have ranged himself. Can you fancy St Paul
   abandoning his Church in favour of any conventicling fanatics, however
   great their sanctity or superior knowledge? The Paul of the Pastoral
   letters resembles the real Paul--however far he is inferior to him in
   intellectual power--a hundred times more nearly than the Paul whom the
   Gnostics imagined for themselves.

   The ecclesiastical teachers who remained faithful to the Old Testament,
   to the Gospel of Jesus, and of the apostle St Paul--that is, the St
   Paul of the Church--saved Christianity from the greatest danger, the
   subtlest temptation, with which it was ever threatened. Gnosticism was
   an attempt on the part of the chaos of peoples to absorb the Gospel of
   Jesus--an attempt which was doubly dangerous, because it assumed the
   appearance of a reaction and professed to have attained to a truer
   estimate and a clearer understanding of Christ and His power. The chaos
   of peoples declared its readiness to assign to Jesus the very highest
   position in the Gnostic religion of redemption if He were prepared to
   become the leader of this its product, consisting of superstition and
   philosophy, of the superior wisdom, of the mysteries, of the ascetic
   ideal, of mysticism and of longing. It was the veritable Satan who said
   to Jesus: "All religions of the world are thine, if Thou wilt fall down
   and worship me." But the ecclesiastical teachers who fought the cause
   of Jesus withstood the temptation. Rather a poor, human, crucified
   Jesus with His serious morality than this king and god in the realm of
   superstition. There was honest reverence for reality, and honest
   indignation against shams in this their answer. There was something
   straightforward, too, a note of democratic defiance, of limited but
   thoroughly healthy Philistinism, a decided "No "to every kind of
   esoteric or aristocratic religion or religious epicurism. Indubitably
   we have here a reaction of the historic Jesus against the fantastic
   figment of human invention.

   Would that the victory had been complete and the deliverance less
   imperfect! But in not a few places the chaos of heathen religions left
   a deep mark on ecclesiastical Christianity; the Church did not succeed
   in entirely repulsing the foreign elements. The Gnostic speculations
   were rejected, and the ecclesiastical thereby the more securely
   established. But are the latter a great deal better or more
   intelligent? The divinity of Christ and the Logos-Christ are heathen
   fabrications just as much as the Gnostic Soter, only it is a great deal
   more difficult to harmonize them with the human Jesus than was the case
   with the Gnostic Christology.

   The defeat of the Gnostic mysteries was effected in like manner. They
   were reduced in number. Instead of the many initiatory and other rites,
   the Church retained for the moment but two Baptism and the Lord's
   Supper. But a portion of the physical and ceremonial theology of
   redemption remained in the very centre of Christianity. This one
   portion was sufficient to hand over the Christian religion--for
   centuries and throughout whole countries--to the dominion of
   superstition. However great an emphasis was laid upon morality, it was
   impossible entirely to avert the danger which was conjured up by the
   sacraments.

   Lastly, the ascetic ideal had to give way to the ethical of the
   Gospels. How loudly the author of the Pastoral epistles thunders
   against those who would hinder marriage. Yet the same author declares
   people who contracted a second marriage to be unfit for the office of
   bishop or deacon. This is a result of the ascetic view of marriage. The
   opinion that marriage is a stain and that virginity is consequently to
   be esteemed more highly as a more holy state, is still upheld by the
   Church. Here we have the source of the later monasticism. In spite,
   therefore, of many striking contrasts the Church and Gnosticism
   continue to share more than enough in common--intellectualism and
   dogma, the sacramental religion, the ascetic view of the sexual
   relation. It is exceedingly significant that these three factors find
   no support whatever in the teaching of Jesus, while they are upheld by
   several passages in the writings of St Paul. And indeed many words of
   the apostle are already accounted as highly as those of their master.

   We must not, it is true, forget that the dangerous attempt to break up
   the Christian Church into a number of little conventicles of fanatical
   saints was brilliantly defeated. The one Catholic Church comes forth
   from the struggle with the Gnostics mightier and more imposing than
   ever before, without having lost anything of its public, universal, and
   democratic character. Separatism appears to be entirely banished from
   it. There is only one kind of Christianity, that of faith, of love, of
   good works. And this was entirely in harmony with the teaching of
   Jesus, who did, it is true, recognize the difference between the
   leaders and the disciples, but suffered no class distinctions among the
   latter. Though the intention was excellent, the Church's protest was
   all in vain, however. The deep lines of cleavage existed as a matter of
   fact. There was, first of all, the difference between the philosophers
   and the laymen, the simple Christians'; and next there were the saints
   and the average worldly Christians. The first distinction was the
   result of the Hellenization of Christianity at the very time when it
   was materialized by the influx of international superstition. The
   latter came in the train of the ascetic and ecstatic tendencies
   noticeable since the days of St Paul. The Christianity founded by Jesus
   was a layman's religion, because in accordance with His teaching, all
   that really matters in God's sight are the fruits of righteousness, of
   purity of heart, of brotherly love, of trust in God. And that is why it
   accords neither theologian nor monk any preference. But even in the
   apostolic age, speculative, mystic and ascetic tendencies began to
   develop by the side of these great essentials. Hence, even at this
   early date, the existence of a twofold kind of Christianity, which fact
   the Gnostics turned to the best account, and the ecclesiastical
   teachers could not suppress with the best will in the world.

   And yet, after all deductions, the Church's victory was the victory of
   the Gospel within the limits that were alone possible at that time. The
   Church's teachers, the opponents of the Gnostics, were the
   representatives of the old Christianity, such as they had received it,
   such as they understood it. No blame, therefore, can attach to them.
   Their merit is to have recognized the attainable and to have attained
   it. In so doing, they secured a fresh lease of life for Christianity.

   The forcible measures employed by the Church.

   The conflict between the Catholic and Gnostic teachers was not carried
   on to the end with merely spiritual weapons. Yes, however bitter it may
   be to have to make the confession, the spiritual weapons of the Church
   would not have sufficed to gain the victory. The struggle began when
   the Church's institutions were exceedingly primitive, the products of
   enthusiasm. The men of the Spirit--apostles, prophets, and
   teachers--were as yet the only authorities besides the words of Jesus,
   and the canon of the Old Testament. Complete freedom of teaching
   prevailed, and great freedom in public worship, with a broad-hearted
   extension of the name of Christian to all who called Jesus Lord. This
   state of things endangered the existence of the congregations and
   threatened them with dissolution, while it rendered the clear
   distinction of the opposing forces exceedingly difficult. The
   employment of forcible measures by the Church becomes intelligible, and
   partly, at least, excusable, when we take this desperate position into
   account.

   Three measures were taken by the Church to put an end to the prevailing
   license. 1. The teachers were placed under Church authority. 2. Public
   worship was centralized and the government of the congregations
   entrusted to the bishops. 3. Heretics were excluded and condemned. The
   birth of the Catholic Church dates from the employment of these
   measures.

   1. The only means of setting some limit to the chaos of conflicting
   opinions appeared to be to place the teachers under Church authority.
   What was the use of refuting erroneous opinions as long as each teacher
   could appeal to the Spirit? The question had to be put: Is any and
   every person to be allowed to bring forward his new doctrines on the
   authority of the Spirit? The question needed but to be put to be
   answered in the negative.

   The authors of the Pastoral letters and of the letters of St John, and
   Ignatius, are united in their efforts to put an end to the freedom of
   teaching. But they use two different means.

   There was first of all the theory that the bishop as such possessed the
   Spirit. The object of this theory was to create fitting instruments for
   the office of teaching. The spirit of knowledge is in the possession of
   few, the apostles and their successors, the bishops. They alone
   preserve the divine tradition (gift--depositum). The spirit of truth is
   handed on in succession from one to another by the laying on of hands.
   The Pastoral letters, which were the first to set up this juridical
   theory, wanted the presbyters themselves to exercise the teachers
   office. But this expectation was doomed to be disappointed. The
   officials had too much to do, and there were teachers besides.
   Nevertheless, the kernel of this theory won the day, that is, the
   doctrine of the depositum' in the hands of the bishops. We find it
   later in Irenaeus and on a more secure foundation, connected, namely,
   with the Roman theory of apostolic succession. It was now no longer
   necessary that the bishop should likewise be a teacher. Merely as
   bishop, the purity of the teaching was guaranteed in his case. So
   Ignatius conceived of his position. He was acquainted with bishops to
   whom the gift of spiritual speech had not been vouchsafed. They were
   better able to keep silent. It mattered not! In spite of all, the
   bishop is the representative of God. He who does not keep to the
   bishop--even in teaching--is far from God.

   Next we have the theory of the Rule of Faith. The aim of this theory is
   itself to create the pure doctrine. It is significant that we come
   across it in the Johannine epistles. The author of these epistles is no
   ecclesiastic, nor is the building up of ecclesiastical office his
   object. His aim is rather to set up a principle which would make a
   judge of every Christian and not merely of the bishop. We are to try
   the spirits, i.e., the prophets and the teachers, whether their spirit
   is of God or not. Knowledge of their teaching is sufficient for this
   examination. He whose teaching is Docetic is not of God. "Jesus Christ
   come in the flesh": such is here the regula fidei. Thereby John attains
   the same end as the Pastoral epistles, only by a shorter road, without
   strengthening the position of the bishops.

   But the setting up of the Rule of Faith is older than John. The author
   of the Pastoral epistles is in reality acquainted with both of these
   ecclesiastical measures. There was an old "preaching of Christ," a
   short summary of all that was essential in Christology. St Paul had
   taught his congregations such an epitome: died, buried, raised again on
   the third day. Additions were gradually made to this short confession,
   and first of all without any reference to Gnostic opponents, the object
   being merely to instruct new converts. The author of the Pastoral
   letters is acquainted with the following new clauses: Of the house of
   David; under Pontius Pilate; who shall come to judge the quick and the
   dead. The omission of all mention of the Virgin Birth, as well as the
   older view of the descent from David, are sufficient proof that at this
   time the story of the miraculous birth had not as yet received official
   sanction. It is only when we come to Ignatius that we find this further
   addition to the summary, though the Davidic descent is as yet by no
   means suppressed. His statement is either: of the house of David, of
   Mary; or, of the seed of David, of the Holy Ghost. Soon after this the
   Davidic descent was either removed from the creed altogether--so in the
   old Roman form: of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary--or ascribed to
   Mary. This is what Justin does: Of Mary the Virgin, who is of the house
   of David. These additions and changes, however, are not to be ascribed
   to any anti-gnostic tendency, but to the necessity of harmonizing the
   catechetical teaching with the widened Faith. We are even told that
   Gnostics managed to interpret this teaching of Christ docetically. And
   yet the creed was of use in the conflict with the Gnostics. It
   furnished a concise formulary of the principal articles of the Faith.
   On this the Christians could take their stand, and to this they could
   retreat when they were hard pressed at any point. Ignatius needs but to
   add his verily' to the born, died,' etc., and he has already driven the
   Gnostics from the field. The congregations were instructed to interpret
   the creed in a strictly anti-gnostic sense, and to use it as a
   defensive weapon. At the beginning of the second century it was used
   here and there in connection with the baptismal confession of belief in
   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. From this combination arose the Apostles
   Creed. Where it was used first of all we do not know.

   Two conditions were now clearly laid down for the teachers:--

   1. Whenever a teacher wishes to exercise his vocation he has to be
   approved by the bishop and be licensed by him.

   2. Every teacher is strictly bound by the regula fidei.

   Important alterations followed hence. The withdrawal of the free
   permission to teach implied negatively the cessation of free
   theological production, positively the exaltation of the ecclesiastical
   tradition, i.e., of the apostles and their writings, into the place of
   the sacred canon.

   One characteristic of the sub-apostolic age is the immense increase in
   the esteem with which the first apostles were regarded. All the
   Gospels, the Acts, the First Epistle of St Clement, Ignatius, the
   Epistle of St Jude, the Didache, all go to prove this point. The men of
   the earlier age--St Paul above all others--had thought in the Spirit.
   The men of this age seek their inspiration in the thoughts of the
   apostles instead of depending directly upon the Spirit. The apostles
   are the Spirit. The farewell discourses in St John are especially
   instructive in this connection. Here we find the last trace of the old
   theory of the Spirit, but only in favour of the apostolic traditions.
   The apostles are led by the Spirit into all truth. In the apostles the
   character of Jesus receives its full illumination; i.e., it is
   understood in all its depth and breadth, and yet so that nothing really
   new is added, but we merely have a reminiscence of that which Jesus
   taught before. The mark of a Christian, according to St John, is the
   abiding in, i.e., the clinging to, Tradition, contrasted with the
   progressive tendencies of the Gnostics. It is now, by means of this
   theory of the special gift of the Spirit to the apostles, that the
   opinion is gradually developed that the apostles have once for all
   authentically and exhaustively described the person and the work of
   Christ, and that the task of later theology is practically the
   tradition of the apostolic interpretation. As early a writing as the
   Book of the Acts corroborates this opinion by its canonization of the
   apostles and glorification of the golden apostolic age, compared with
   which the author's own age appears a time of decadence. To the
   prevalence of this opinion must be ascribed, too, the composition of
   numerous pseudonymic apostolic writings--above all, of the Catholic
   epistles. Had there not been a very strong feeling of decadence abroad,
   men would never have gone to such lengths.

   As a rule these writings are of a perfectly harmless character, and at
   least they do not threaten the stability of the Rule of Faith by any
   originality. We may safely conclude, e.g., from the occurrence of the
   idea of Christ's descent into Hades in the First Epistle of St Peter,
   that it had already found acceptance in a considerable portion of the
   Church. Later, to be sure, it found its way even into the Creed.

   The increased reverence paid to the apostles and their work resulted in
   the formation of the canon of the New Testament. At first we have, of
   course, just a collection of the apostolic writings. The process was,
   however, a very rapid one. The first letter of St Clement, written from
   Rome to Corinth towards the end of the first century, assumes its
   readers acquaintance with a number of the letters of St Paul, the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, the Synoptic Gospels, the Acts. Two decades
   later we find in Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, mention of all four
   Gospels, the letters of St Paul, including the Pastoral epistles, and
   the Apocalypse; shortly afterwards in Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, the
   Acts, and the First of St Peter and the First of St John in addition.
   The Epistle of Polycarp is especially instructive for the rapid growth
   of the canon. The writer is a widely respected bishop, who is said to
   have had personal intercourse with the apostles, or, at least, with the
   disciples of Jesus. And yet he gives us scarcely anything but
   quotations from the later writings of the New Testament, scarcely any
   thing of his own. In so doing he presupposes the possession of copies
   of the apostolic writings by the larger congregations in their
   archives. Papias, the Bishop of Hierapolis and contemporary of
   Polycarp, shows us what great interest was still taken in the oral
   tradition of the apostles. He travelled about everywhere inquiring for
   sayings of the apostles, and based upon these inquiries he published a
   collection of apocryphal sayings and legends in his "Exposition of
   Oracles of the Lord." But the presupposition of his whole work is that
   everyone is acquainted with the main features of the gospel story as
   contained in the written Gospels. The commencement of the formation of
   the canon really dates from very soon after the turn of the first
   century. It is marked by two characteristics, the collection of the
   apostolic writings and the consciousness of living in a decadent age.
   Everything else--the investment of the book with its sacred character,
   its elevation to the level of the Old Testament--flows from these
   without breach of continuity or sense of innovation.

   The formation of the canon marks the end of the first age of
   Christianity under certain aspects. The old Christianity projects
   itself, as it were, into the canon, and sets up its own past as an
   object of veneration. Now, too, the chief motive power of the first
   great age, hero-worship, may be said to be no longer operative.

   Instead of the heroes themselves, their writings are accessible as a
   written law. Here, half a century before Montanism, we have the
   death-knell of prophecy and of the ever-progressive spirit. The Church
   of tradition has been formed. Its teachers, Justin and Irenaeus, are
   right in maintaining that they are merely conservative, that they hand
   on unchanged to their successors the old and sacred deposit which they
   have themselves received.

   2. Nor was the second measure, the centralization of public worship and
   Church government in the hands of the bishop--who was almost everywhere
   in an independent position of supremacy--less decisive.

   In the old time it was the itinerant preachers who exercised all the
   authority and were counted as the divine instruments for the whole
   Church. As often as they came to a congregation they took the
   precedence over all the church officers. It was supposed, e.g., that a
   prophet could pray more effectively than a bishop. Here we have the key
   to the power which the Gnostics managed to acquire. Owing to these
   peculiar circumstances they were able to gain adherents in every
   congregation, and to form branches of their schools and sects in every
   locality. We have therefore to picture to ourselves congregations in
   which Catholic and Gnostic societies existed happily side by side, just
   as did the various family churches which Rom. xvi. presupposes. Indeed
   the progress of Gnosticism was in a great measure due to the
   fascination which preachers coming from outside always exercise in a
   congregation.

   If, therefore, Gnosticism was to be extirpated, the freedom of public
   worship and of ecclesiastical action must be limited. This had not as
   yet happened at the time of the Pastoral letters. And yet things were
   pointing that way. We read, for instance: He that "consenteth not to
   sound words and to the doctrine which is according to godliness (which
   surely includes the services of the Church), is puffed up." Definite
   measures of centralization, however, are still wanting; nor can we be
   surprised at this as long as the bishop is merely the president of the
   college of presbyters. Public worship can only be effectively
   centralized when episcopacy has become monarchical.

   The Johannine letters, too, which probably date but a few years later
   than the Pastoral epistles, furnish us with proofs that public worship
   had not been completely centralized by the time of their composition.
   In the Third Epistle we still find the old itinerant preachers
   wandering about and trying to gain a hearing, while the head of one
   particular congregation--presumably the bishop--refuses to give them a
   reception. Here we have both tendencies actively at work--that to the
   monarchical episcopate (Diotrephes, who very much wishes to be the
   first); and that to the centralization of public worship--the exclusion
   of the itinerant preachers.

   Both tendencies reach their culminating point in Ignatius. The
   monarchical episcopate must now be presupposed, at least for Asia Minor
   and Syria. There is no longer any need to struggle for that. But the
   struggle still continues for the centralization of public worship and
   church government in the hands of the bishop and the college of elders.
   That is the only weapon wherewith to ward off the danger of heresy. And
   it is something relatively new, for the greatest emphasis is laid upon
   it. So entirely does it engross the thoughts of Ignatius, that he
   speaks of it even in an ecstatic condition. Once at Philadelphia, he
   cried out in the midst of an assembly in a loud voice, the voice of
   God: "Keep to the bishop and the presbytery and the deacons."
   Afterwards he assures the men of Philadelphia that he had had no
   previous knowledge of divisions in the congregation: his utterance had
   been inspired by the Spirit. And no wonder, for out of the abundance of
   the heart the mouth speaketh. On the lips of Ignatius the word bishop
   occurs about as frequently as the phrase kingdom of God' did on those
   of the previous generations of Christians.

   Never did any man use more extravagant language about the
   ecclesiastical importance of the bishop than Ignatius. To the people he
   says: "Where the shepherd is, there do ye follow as sheep"; "Wherever
   the bishop appears, there let the multitude be; just as where Jesus
   Christ is, there is the Church Catholic." Apart from bishop,
   presbyters, and deacons there is no Church. "As many as are of God and
   of Jesus Christ are with the bishop." The practical consequence of this
   exaltation of the episcopate is the one command which runs through all
   the letters alike: "Let no man do anything without the bishop"; "He
   that doeth anything without the knowledge of the bishop serveth the
   devil." That Eucharist is alone to be held lawful which is celebrated
   by the bishop or by his duly appointed deputy. "It is not allowable
   either to baptize or to hold a love feast without the bishop, but
   whatsoever he may approve, this also is well-pleasing to God." Those
   who marry are likewise to obtain the bishop's consent to their union.
   "One body of Christ, one cup, one altar, just as there is one bishop
   together with his presbyters and deacons." So speaks the first
   sacerdotalist.

   Ignatius attained his aim. The centralization of public worship set up
   an effective barrier against the heretics. There was nothing left for
   them to do but to become schismatics, and to establish rival
   congregations of their own. Rarely, however, did they attain to any
   efficient form of organization. Tertullian speaks of this as their
   weakest point. And this is what we should expect, for where the Spirit
   rules there can be no strict ecclesiastical order.

   The Church won the day, but at the cost of uniformity and rigidity. The
   old freedom vanished, and with it the rich and varied life of the first
   age.

   3. The prohibition of the freedom of teaching and of worship involved
   the exclusion of all those who would not conform to the new
   regulations. This last measure is the most to be regretted, because it
   exalted fanaticism into a place of permanent power in the Church.

   The Church had indeed been narrow and even fanatical since the days of
   St Paul, but only with regard to those that were without, to the
   unbelievers. Every unbelieving Jew or heathen was, it is true, counted
   capable of redemption; as yet, however, he was a child of wrath, in the
   toils of the devil and on the road to damnation. For this, however,
   there was compensation in the earlier age of which we are speaking.
   There was great liberality towards all that were within the Church.
   Every one who called Jesus his Lord was accounted a member of the
   congregation. It mattered not under what category his Gnosis fell.
   Hence the rich variety of views built up upon the same faith.

   But with the commencement of the struggle against Gnosticism all this
   was altered. The conceptions of heresy and of orthodoxy are now formed.
   The word heresy' was at first used in no bad sense; it meant any
   particular tendency and was applied at first especially to particular
   doctrines, and then also to the party which gathered round about them.
   So Josephus and St Luke speak of the heresy' of the Pharisees, of the
   Sadducees, of the Essenes; the Christians, too, were called "the heresy
   of the Nazarenes"--this, of course, rather by their Jewish opponents.
   In St Paul, on the other hand, the word already signifies divisions
   which do indeed appear of necessity in the congregation, but originate
   in the flesh and are contrary to the divine will. But there is nothing
   to show that he had dogmatic divisions in view. It was only the age of
   the Gnostic struggle that produced this ecclesiastical use of the word.
   The Epistle to Titus is the earliest document in which heretics' are
   mentioned. The heretic is to be admonished once, twice; if he does not
   yield he is to be rejected, for such a man is perverted and stands
   self-condemned. Here we have the new conception of heresy. Heresy is
   deviation from the teaching of the Church, and as such involves
   exclusion and condemnation. Opposed to it is assent to the pure
   doctrine of the Church, orthodoxy. We first meet with --this
   expression--almost verbally in Justin Martyr.

   The Pastoral epistles are also our oldest document for all the
   virulence of ecclesiastical fanaticism. Their polemics against the
   Gnostics are characterized by ecclesiastical haughtiness, insinuations
   of immorality, and the condemnation of their opponents as devilish.' Of
   the three the last is the most easily comprehensible in the case of
   theologians who imagined the whole kingdom of the air to be filled with
   devils, and who, moreover, had Paul for their master, who himself saw a
   temptation of the devil in every other gospel but his own. So we read
   that those that set themselves up in opposition are in the snares of
   Satan; they give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. Most
   objectionable of all, however, is the presupposition of immorality
   which the pseudo-Paul invites all his ecclesiastical followers to
   harbour in the case of all heretics. He is fond of discharging long
   catalogues of vices upon his opponents, in which, besides the faults
   which they really had, a number of such were likewise ascribed to them
   which are presupposed in the case of every godless individual. You may
   safely assume of every one who shows a tendency to Gnostic ideas that
   he is a morally bad man. "Some have thrust from them their good
   conscience, and so have made shipwreck concerning the faith." It is
   only the lusts of the Christians, i.e., their moral corruption, which
   are the cause of the increase of the opponents. The heretical teachers
   are one and all "seared in their own conscience." We shall soon see
   that this kind of polemics did not remain ineffective. To cast
   suspicion upon heretics was henceforth one of the characteristics of
   orthodoxy. If we turn to the practical measures that were employed, we
   shall find that the bishop was to make as short work as possible of the
   heretics. He is to shun disputations. He is not to make much ado. Let
   him admonish them once, twice. If that is of no avail he must thrust
   them out. The Church must hand over her opponents to Satan, just as St
   Paul handed over the incestuous person. This throws a bright light on
   the difference between the two ages. Deviation from right doctrine is
   punished now, as was once a moral crime.

   The Johannine epistles are worthy successors of the Pastoral, as their
   author, the so-called apostle of love, shows himself to be a past
   master in the art of judging and condemning. Just as he exhibited his
   narrow hatred in the Gospel against the unbelieving Jews, those
   children of the devil, those thieves and robbers, so here in the
   epistle he manifests the same hatred against all the brethren who do
   not think exactly as he does. The Gnostics are liars in whom the truth
   dwelleth not, and who walk in darkness. If you would understand them
   aright, you must see anti-Christ in them; their existence is only
   comprehensible as a temptation of the devil in the last hour. The
   second letter draws the practical conclusion: as all Docetists are
   deceivers and anti-Christs, and have not God, they are not to be
   received into the house, nor are they to be given greeting, for he that
   giveth them greeting partaketh in their evil works.

   The anecdote which Irenaeus relates of St John agrees very well with
   this passage: When St John on one occasion learnt that Cerinthus was in
   the same public bathing establishment as himself, he rushed out of it,
   exclaiming, "Let us flee lest the house break down upon us, for
   Cerinthus is within, the enemy of the truth." Should this anecdote be
   historically reliable, the Johannine Epistles have certainly faith
   fully reproduced the spirit of this John.

   As Ignatius and Polycarp are acquainted with both Pastoral and
   Johannine epistles, they afford a proof of the eminent success attained
   by the practice of passing judgment upon heretics, common among the
   older teachers. Ignatius continues to assume the immorality of the
   Gnostics: "He that does anything without the bishop is not clean in his
   conscience. The adversaries have no good conscience, as they do not
   come to the principal assembly." And there is the same reproach of
   having sprung from the devil. "Their worship is that of Satan, and
   their unction is from below. Let all men shun in them the snares and
   the wiles of the prince of this world. They are no plants which the
   heavenly Father hath planted, but tares which bring forth deadly fruit.
   Every teacher that is an heretic shall come into the unquenchable fire,
   and so likewise whosoever gives heed to him. Whosoever follows a
   schismatic cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven." The practical
   result of which was that the orthodox Christians were to treat their
   heretical brothers as not belonging to the Church--nay, as even worse
   than infidels. For he that followeth not the bishop, hath no part in
   the Church. "Every Docetist blasphemeth the Lord, and is an atheist,
   i.e., an unbeliever. It is only through their evil cunning that they
   bear the Christian name. Avoid them like wild beasts, for they are mad
   dogs; they lie in wait for you and bite you; they are brutes in human
   shape. Not merely are you not to receive them into your houses, you are
   not even to meet them; all that you may do is to pray for them that
   they be converted"--a hard matter, to be sure. Ignatius shrinks from
   uttering the names of the unbelievers, and even from thinking of them.
   He forbids all men to speak of the Gnostics either in public or in
   private. In all this hatred of his against the heretics, he has a
   trusty henchman in his friend Polycarp. "Every man that confesseth not
   that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is an anti-Christ. And
   whosoever confesseth not the testimony of the cross is of the devil,
   and whosoever perverteth the words of the Lord according to his own
   lusts, and denieth either the resurrection or the judgment, he is the
   first-born of Satan." Once when Polycarp, meeting Marcion, was asked by
   the latter whether he did not know him, he answered, "Yes, I know
   thee--the first born of Satan." Such was the fruit of the seed sown by
   the authors of the Pastoral and Johannine epistles.

   True, even now, the door stood open for the Gnostics to return. Only
   they had to do penance. Gnostic views were counted to be exactly as bad
   as gross moral sins. One great advantage was, it must be admitted,
   gained by this hateful device. All doubt and ambiguity was at an end.
   Within the Church--the boast was justified--there was one faith, one
   confession.

   But the Christians who remained faithful to this confession had lost
   qualities which their Lord and Master had esteemed most highly--love
   and humanity. The very prayer for the conversion of the Gnostics is
   more Pharisaic than Christian, and does not spring from simple human
   love.

   The result of this division into the two camps of orthodoxy and heresy
   was that Christianity now entirely acquired a scholastic dogmatic
   character, and in a very serious degree lost its original
   peculiarity--that of being an essentially ethical religion.

   Originally this scholastic dogmatic character was completely foreign to
   Christianity. Christianity was a layman's personal religion under the
   guidance of a prophet. It was entirely undogmatic. The only article in
   its creed, Jesus is the Messiah, belonged to the sphere of religious
   hope, and was not therefore capable of proof.

   Controversies with the Jews brought about the first symptoms of change.
   No documents, it is true, have come down to us from the very earliest
   age, but all that we can gather from the Acts of the Apostles and the
   Gospel of St John indicates that anti-Jewish apologetics soon
   degenerated into the squabbles of rival schools. The controversy ranged
   over every variety of subject, but the most important of all is left
   untouched. What the Christians wanted to do was to harmonize the
   picture of Jesus with the dogmas of the Messianic theology, and to
   prove that Jesus was after all the Messiah in accordance with Jewish
   dogma. As though the cause of Jesus had thereby been advanced in the
   very slightest degree! That a redemptive power went forth from Jesus,
   that through the simplification of His message He burst Judaism
   asunder--all this was disregarded as unimportant. And so in very deed
   Christianity became a heresy, a separate opinion, like that of the
   Pharisees, though, unlike theirs, not ecclesiastically tolerated; it
   was too revolutionary for that.

   Under these circumstances it must be considered fortunate that
   Christianity was transferred to Greek soil. If it took root here at
   all, it must be as a new religion, for the squabbles of the Messianic
   theology were unintelligible to the Greeks. Numberless dogmatic
   presuppositions are, it is true, at the basis of St Paul's preaching,
   but what the apostle sets forth is above all a way of salvation in view
   of the day of judgment; he takes the Spirit and miracles into account,
   and postulates a new creature in Christ Jesus. The oldest Gentile
   Christian religion was the worship of the Divinity of Christ. Whosoever
   confessed this religion belonged to no school, but was one of the
   brethren. No Christian teacher of the earliest age compared or opposed
   Christian dogmas to the dogmas of the schools of the philosophers.

   Gnosticism provoked the crisis which sooner or later must have been
   brought about through the influence of Greek philosophy. The Gnostics
   aim was to understand the revelation given to faith, and to adapt it to
   their own opinions, while they were all the while under the delusion
   that in so doing they were inspired of the Spirit. It was not long
   before differences of opinion and heresies manifested themselves. Just
   as the Jewish Rabbis variously interpreted the Oracles of the Old
   Testament, and then split up into different schools, so each Gnostic
   teacher cut the Christian faith after his own pattern, and a number of
   schools and a whole multitude of dogmas resulted thence. The dogmas
   were not the really important thing to the Gnostics themselves, but it
   was these that first engaged the attention of the Christian teachers,
   and became the object of their criticism and attack.

   Now in controverting the Gnostics, the ecclesiastical teachers adapted
   themselves to their opponents' scholastic view of Christianity. All
   that they did was to oppose ecclesiastical to Gnostic dogmas. The
   development of the struggle for the Rule of Faith signifies the victory
   of scholastic Christianity: in other words, the greatest importance is
   attached to pure doctrine; on adhesion to this doctrine depends the
   right to bear the name of Christian; where the purity of the doctrine
   is in the slightest degree impaired, there is no Church, no
   Christianity. Christianity is identified with orthodoxy.

   The religion of Christ thus underwent the greatest change of all. The
   practical and the personal no longer formed, as they did before, the
   core and centre of the faith. Originally the true marks of Christianity
   were the ardour of its hope, the strictness of the new life,
   inspiration for Jesus. Whosoever had suffered himself to be redeemed by
   Jesus so as to attain the freedom of a child of God, was accounted a
   Christian. No one had inquired as to the dogmas which he accepted. And
   so the oldest community was a fellowship united by the same enthusiasm
   and working for the same ends. This conception of Christianity was
   supplanted in the course of the struggle with Gnosticism by the
   scholastic, dogmatic view. The new confessional Christianity is
   scholastic.

   The expression Catholic Church' first occurs in Ignatius in the course
   of the Gnostic controversy, and there signifies the Church universal,
   which embraces the whole of Christianity as contrasted with the
   particular congregations. It then expressed a geographical idea, and
   had not as yet become a battle-cry against the heretics. But, as a
   matter of fact, it is quite true to say that from this time onward
   Catholics and heretics stood opposed to each other. For indeed it is
   only since we have Gnostic theologies and Gnostic Churches that we have
   a Catholic theology and a Catholic Church. The whole of Catholicism
   arose as the reaction of the Church against the foreign influences of
   the chaos of heathen religions. In so far it was an innovation. The
   benefits which it conferred from the very first certainly outweigh any
   injury which it inflicted. It rallied all the sound, ethical and
   evangelical forces in the old Christianity, welded them together, and
   inspired them with strength for the victorious contest. It saved the
   Christian religion from being entirely engulfed in the maelstrom of
   peoples and religions, and secured for it a safe and quiet future and
   the victory over the world.

   Gnosticism made of Jesus a divine phantom, Catholicism rescued the true
   Jesus. In any case we are here more in the line of the direct
   succession from primitive Christianity. The mischievous innovation
   which it introduced was the exaltation of orthodoxy and ecclesiasticism
   into leading marks of Christianity, in contrast to the freedom of
   teaching and the freedom from Church discipline that characterized the
   Gnostics. Henceforth assent to the pure doctrine and subjection to the
   bishop are a sine qua non in the case of every Christian. The old
   leading marks are secondary matters. In other words, hostility towards
   the unbelieving Christians outside of the Church comes to be a sign of
   true Christianity. And this state of things was not, alas, materially
   altered at the Reformation.

THE THEOLOGY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI.

  THE FATE OF JESUS.

   THE origin of the New Testament is the last important event in the
   history of the early days of Christianity, and at the same time that
   which most deeply influenced all successive centuries. It is most
   intimately bound up with the struggle against the Gnostics, because
   this implied the cessation of the original productive activity and the
   consecration of tradition, i.e., of the apostles and their writings.
   Its sources, however, are to be traced to far older fundamental
   presuppositions of Christianity.

   Christianity was bound to obtain its New Testament, because Judaism had
   its Old Testament. Originating as it did from a book-religion and
   developing in the constant veneration of the sacred writings, it was
   inevitably destined itself to become a, book-religion in its turn.
   Jesus, it is true, wished to set His disciples free from the learning
   of the Scribes, and St Paul gave as his watchword: "Not the letter but
   the Spirit." The great mass of Christians, however, remained as
   incapable as before of conceiving religion without the sacred book, and
   the Pauline gnosis confirmed them in this tendency. One can never
   overestimate the power of such a tradition. Individuals can emancipate
   themselves from it, but not the community. Is not the fact that the
   whole of the Old Testament could become a Christian book very striking
   in itself? How many chapters, how many books, it contains which
   directly contradict Jesus and the Gospel! And yet the question whether
   it should be received or not was never even raised in the Church. It is
   of a text which must have sounded exceptionally strange to Christian
   ears, "I said, Ye are Gods," that Jesus says (according to the Fourth
   Gospel), "The Scripture cannot be broken." When people, however, have
   conceptions such as these of a book-religion so completely engrained in
   them from earliest infancy, it may confidently be predicted that they
   are certain sooner or later to obtain their own sacred writings. Thus
   ultimately the origin of the New Testament can be traced back to the
   consecration of the book of the law, Deuteronomy, under King Josiah. It
   was only a question of time when the veneration that was felt for the
   Old Testament should be extended to Christian writings as well.

   But the origin of the New Testament was likewise necessitated by the
   circumstances of Christianity itself. St Paul, the founder of the
   science of the Church, is the father of the New Testament, although he
   himself certainly thought of nothing less than that. It was he who
   first clearly contrasted Christian thought as revealed knowledge with
   all non-Christian thought as natural knowledge. Christian writings did
   not enter into his consideration here in the very remotest degree; but
   it is plain that a later generation could as easily ascribe Christian
   writings to the inspiration of the Spirit as St Paul ascribed
   glossolaly and prophecy. Here, too, we have the only justification for
   the separation of the New Testament, not from other Christian writings,
   but from the writings of other peoples and religions. The Christian
   Scriptures alone are the product of the Christian spirit--or ought to
   be, one thinks of the Apocalypse!--no other book is the fruit of this
   Spirit. The more foreign elements the Church took over in course of
   time from Judaism and Hellenism, the more important it was that it
   should possess in these writings of the earliest Christian age a
   constant standard for that which was Christian or in conformity with
   the Church. At the same time, of course, the argument from Scripture is
   subject to the same limitations as that from the theory of the Spirit
   in which it originates--both alike appeal exclusively to such as are
   Christians already; no one else can be convinced by them.

   It was the struggle with the Gnostics and, generally speaking, certain
   definite conditions, which determined the selection of these Christian
   writings. The first decade of the second century seems to fulfil these
   conditions best. The fact that the writings which form the New
   Testament towards the end of the second century were already--with
   scarcely any exceptions in the possession of the ecclesiastical writers
   Ignatius, Polycarp and Papias, at the beginning of the century, and
   that no others come under the same category, would appear to lead us
   inevitably to such a conclusion. This applies to the four Gospels and
   the Acts of the Apostles, the letters of St Paul with the Pastoral
   epistles, the First letter of St Peter, the First of St John, the
   Apocalypse. The Epistle of St Jude is too short to admit of our saying
   definitely that it was known to these writers. But the Second Epistle
   of St Peter shows us that it was well known at a time when apostolic
   writings were still manufactured. I expressly do not say that their
   writings formed the canon at this early date. The only fact that it is
   important here to establish is that teachers of the Church found
   edification and instruction in these writings and in none others, and
   made copious use of them. Our insight into the growth of the idea of
   the canon is unfortunately very much less clear than it would otherwise
   have been, owing to the fact that of Justin's writings (dating from
   about the middle of the century) only apologies and no ecclesiastical
   tracts have been preserved. For in controversial writings intended for
   heathen or Jewish readers there was no place for any appeal to the
   authority of St Paul, and it is a mere chance that we obtain an
   accurate knowledge of the esteem in which the Apocalypse was held in
   the Church. The only facts that we can establish are that the Epistles
   of St Paul, the Gospel of St John, and the Acts, belong to the
   necessary presuppositions of Justin's writings. We learn from a genuine
   fragment that he had a controversy with the Gnostics concerning a
   passage in St Paul in 1 Cor. xv. 50. It is probable, therefore, that
   his statement as to the reading of the gospels together with the law
   and the prophets in the public services does not tell us--i.e., his
   heathen readers--everything. In addition to this we have the frequent
   use of the New Testament writings in the contemporaneous Gnostic
   schools, which certainly dates from a later time than that of the
   Church. All these considerations incline us to conclude that the
   decisive occurrences of the collection and selection of these writings
   out of the whole mass of Christian literature took place while the
   second century was still in its infancy.

   Now if the New Testament as a whole dates from the beginning of the
   second century, its theology must in the main be the theology of this
   period. The theology of the New Testament is the theology of
   Catholicism, as it originates at the beginning of the second century.
   However much older the single writings may be, however much unwritten
   tradition those who collected and ordered the writings may have
   respected in addition, the body of writings as a whole must have
   corresponded to their thoughts and feelings. Here we have a fact which
   deserves notice even to-day. When the New Testament as a whole is our
   authority, then we are simply submitting to the judgment of the Church
   at the beginning of the second century. It is not the words of Jesus or
   the letters of St Paul which are then our final court of appeal, but
   the thoughts of the ecclesiastics who selected the words of Jesus and
   the letters of St Paul together with documents of a later date to form
   the canon of the Christian scriptures.

   The New Testament is composed of two strata of documents. The older
   includes the Synoptics, the genuine letters of St Paul, the Apocalypse;
   the later the Gospel of St John, the Acts, the Pastoral epistles, 1
   Peter, 1 John. The two strata are to be conceived of in such a relation
   that the older writings are occasionally to be interpreted by the
   later, and occasionally they are obscured by them--that is the
   world-historic significance of the New Testament.

   The writings of the older strata are our real authority for the history
   of the earliest Christian age--the world's greatest possession for all
   time. A grand and savage freedom characterizes them all, though in
   varying degrees. What St Paul has left us has come down to us with the
   least change, a series of occasional letters called forth simply and
   solely by the needs of the moment, revealing the man just as he was,
   rough-hewn, without any artificial shaping or polishing. The letter to
   the Ephesians is the only one that here and there strikes one as not
   belonging to the series, but that which it shares in common with his
   other letters outweighs in importance the marks of a later age. If only
   Jesus could speak to us as directly as His apostle, how gladly we would
   surrender all the gospels! In the best of cases it is but a broken
   impression that we obtain of Him. We have lost the oldest written
   sources, the collection of logia from which Matthew and Luke derived
   their discourses, and much else besides. No writing of an eyewitness of
   Jesus has come down to us. Even St Mark's narrative would have been
   incorporated by the first and third evangelists in their compilations
   and so deprived of its separate existence had they been able to do as
   they wished. In spite of the amputated conclusion it is a great piece
   of good fortune that they did not succeed. Although entirely the
   product of the faith of the Church, it is the least ecclesiastical
   writing about Jesus. It describes the prophet, the worker of miracles,
   the Messiah, the Son of God, with such ardent enthusiasm, so heroic, so
   great, and yet so human, that ten years later it could not be
   tolerated. Matthew and Luke created the great ecclesiastical gospels;
   the former, more nearly allied to Jewish thought and speech, writes
   rather more legally and with ecclesiastical institutions in view, the
   latter for the Gentile Church; he is edifying, and would touch the
   feelings even at the cost of stern truth. The gospels of the infancy
   and the conclusions are characteristic of this later age. All that was
   missed in the life of Jesus was put into the mouth of the risen Lord:
   the mission to the Gentiles, baptism, the christianizing of the Old
   Testament. These two Gospels already mark the transition to the second
   group. Then, again, the Apocalypse is a book that stands by itself; it
   is a prophecy and a war-cry, and both are inspired by the Holy Ghost.
   It stands in the New Testament as the book of the Spirit, to which one
   pointed with pride in controversy with the Jews abandoned by God's
   Spirit.

   We must endeavour to realize what inconvenient problems were occasioned
   for the later age by the existence of these writings. In the first
   place, Jesus and St Paul by no means agreed together. In Jesus we have
   the promise of the kingdom of God and the call to do God's will in
   order to enter into this kingdom. Such are the essential contents of
   the preaching of Jesus in all three Synoptists. The person of Jesus is
   painted with ecclesiastical enthusiasm, but the preaching of Jesus is
   not ecclesiastical until we come to the conclusions. Nowhere do we find
   blessedness attached to Jesus alone, or faith in Him as the Messiah
   demanded by Himself. The whole groundwork of the synoptical tradition
   originates from a time when there was as yet no Church. The gospel of
   St Paul is of an entirely different nature: the heavenly Son of God who
   was crucified for our salvation and rose again, and the way to
   salvation, faith in the grace of God that was manifested in Him. How
   can these two be harmonized? And even if the Church decided to follow
   St Paul--and in all essential points it did follow his guidance--then
   it had some very hard knots to untie in his own person. He stands there
   in complete isolation, in eager contest with the emissaries from
   Jerusalem, not over-friendly to the twelve themselves, united to Jesus
   Himself by nothing but a vision. And his gospel is unusually severe and
   stern, hostile to the law, dangerous to morality itself when it
   proclaims the impossibility of the fulfilment of the law and the
   supremacy of the Spirit instead of the law. True, St Paul is a
   Churchman, but how free he is, how enthusiastic, how indifferent as to
   whether he creates lasting ecclesiastical organizations for later
   generations. The genuine historic Paul looks down like a giant from a
   steep and solitary height upon a race of dwarfs.

   It is true that the early Christians scarcely realized these
   contradictions and problems as sharply as this. Had this been the case,
   then all the writings of the second strata must of course have been
   conscious forgeries composed with the set purpose of effacing the
   picture of the first age by superimposing another. And then, too, we
   should have expected some reactionary movement to have been started
   long before Marcion stood forth as the enthusiastic champion of the
   older era. Such a supposition is unnecessary. The smoothing of rough
   corners and edges, the harmonizing of contradictions, the setting of
   Jesus and St Paul in an ecclesiastical framework, can be explained for
   the most part, without the assumption of any conscious intention,
   through the rapid development of catholic modes of thought in the
   second and third generation. We can realize this process very vividly
   when we examine the way in which the synoptic sources have been edited.
   It was a perfectly natural assumption for the later evangelists to
   suppose Jesus to have been really such as they depicted Him in their
   additions and corrections. They are entirely innocent of so wanton an
   act as the conscious adaptation of the historic picture of Christ to
   the imaginings of their own faith. On the contrary, they fancy that it
   is the earlier evangelists, who are their models, who have made
   mistakes and omissions which they correct, fully supposing themselves
   to be in the right. And then, too, we must not forget that this later
   age finds many points of contact--real or imaginary--in the old
   writings for its own favourite thoughts. Certain expressions and verses
   in St Mark which were intended in anything rather than a Pauline sense
   suggested to it quite naturally Pauline thoughts of the Son of God, of
   the atoning death of Jesus, of universal salvation, of the necessity of
   faith. Before the Gospel of St John was written the Synoptists were
   read in a Johannine, that is, a Pauline sense. No very great power of
   imagination is needed in order to understand how this could be done, as
   three-fourths of the readers of the Bible still read it in exactly the
   same way, and the most popular devotional literature effectually
   prevents the possibility of any other method of interpretation. In
   reading the Sermon on the Mount faith in Jesus is simply taken as a
   natural presupposition. The sayings and parables of the forgiveness of
   sins through the love of God, our Heavenly Father, are interpreted with
   the tacit addition "for the sake of the blood of Jesus Christ." So our
   readers of the Bible read the Gospels to-day, and so, too, the
   Christians read them at the end of the first century. Now just as Jesus
   was here interpreted in an ecclesiastical and Pauline sense, so St Paul
   had also to suffer his letters to be interpreted in an altogether
   different sense from that in which they were written. They were read as
   the letters of a talented ecclesiastic and preacher, whereas they had
   been written by a revolutionary and altogether original genius. This
   generation, which exalted the continuity of tradition into the canon of
   truth, had no understanding for his originality and independence, for
   his antithesis "of God and not of men." They were disposed to cover up
   the disputes of Christians with each other under the mantle of love. So
   great was the change that had come over the whole ecclesiastical
   position, that as often as they read about the sharp antitheses of his
   theology they endeavoured to harmonize and to minimize them, while
   edifying themselves with his polemics against the Jews, with his
   comforting words as to grace and faith, with his lofty morality and the
   inexhaustible treasures of practical ecclesiastical wisdom in his
   letters. All this was done before the Acts of the Apostles and the
   Pastoral epistles existed, just as it is done to-day on the basis of
   these writings. Nor can we fail to recognize the influence of the
   Gospels on the interpretation of St Paul. A positive relation to the
   law, a higher estimation of good works, are like wise discovered in St
   Paul, and he is imagined as an evangelist of the life of Jesus as well
   as of His death.

   It is impossible to arrive at any fair estimate of the writings of the
   second strata unless we realize the entire change which had taken place
   in the thought of the Church, in which all Christians participated
   alike and which cannot be attributed to any single individual. The
   authors of the Gospel of St John and the Acts of the Apostles and the
   rest of these documents must still be allowed a considerable measure of
   original composition, even if the motives and presuppositions of their
   writings are to be found in the Christian atmosphere by which they were
   surrounded. It is only by taking this atmosphere into account that it
   becomes comprehensible that they dared to do what they did, and that
   they were met by understanding and approval in all quarters. But then
   it also becomes evident that their writings cease to be historical
   documents for Jesus and His gospel, or for St Paul, his character and
   his theology. They tell us what the growing Catholic Church thought
   about Jesus and St Paul. Further than that their historical reliability
   does not go.

   The Gospel of St John exceeds all the rest of these writings in
   importance. The picture which it draws of Jesus had an all-powerful
   influence upon the Catholic Church, the Reformers, and even
   Schleiermacher and his successors. Nothing, however, is more opposed to
   the truth than to isolate it and to ascribe to it a solitary
   originality to which it makes no claim whatever itself. We have had to
   mention it in all the chapters of the sub-apostolic age, because it
   takes so prominent a part in all the struggles and efforts of the
   Church. It appears to belong to no particular age and to stand above
   and outside of history, but in spite of this appearance there is
   scarcely any other writing of the early Christian era which is more a
   child of its own time and which influences the life of the Church more
   directly. The author stands like a general on a lofty watch-tower. At
   his feet he beholds the hosts of the Jews, the Greeks, and in his own
   Christian camp the Gnostics. He forms a clear conception of the
   position of each of these, and issues plain decisive commands how each
   is to be met. He combines the conqueror's enthusiasm with the
   unrelenting severity of the combatant.

   It is to the Greeks that he is evidently the most favourably inclined.
   For them he gives the watchword of the Logos--in the prologue of the
   Gospel--which after having sought in vain for reception in the world
   incarnates itself in the person of Jesus Christ, whence it manifests
   the glory of God. It is true that he does not follow up this thought
   any longer. He does not as yet think of proving by the words and life
   of Jesus that the world's reason here revealed itself. It is not the
   Logos but the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who is the subject of his
   story. But yet he closes the public ministry of Jesus with the
   prophetic approach of the first Greeks and the Saviour's outlook to the
   time when He should draw all men to Himself, whilst the prophecy of
   condemnation upon Israel for the hardening of their hearts should be
   fulfilled. In other places, too, he keeps the Gentile Church
   continually in view when he speaks of Jesus as the Saviour of the
   world, when he places the Gentile Church by the side of the Jewish, and
   makes the dying Jesus pray for all who shall hereafter come to the
   faith. His undisguised admiration of Jesus as the God whose mighty
   wonders everywhere reveal the mystery--God born of God--shows us how
   entirely he himself can look at things from the standpoint of Greek
   thought. This favourable disposition towards the Greeks does not, of
   course, extend to such as profess the religion of Polytheism. It is
   only for the Gentiles who have become Christians that John wishes to
   remove a stumbling-block. "Do not," he would say, "be distressed by the
   fact that Jesus lived in Palestine. He is the Saviour of the world for
   you, for you quite especially." Nor was it the apostles who first
   brought the Gospel to the Samaritans in contradiction, as some might
   think, to the practice of the Master Himself. It was none other than
   Jesus who began the mission to the Samaritans. Even before this the
   conclusions of St Matthew and St Luke were written with a view to
   enable the Gentile Christians to find comfort in the assurance that
   Jesus had thought of them definitely. But St John was the first to
   depict Jesus such as every Gentile Christian was bound to think of Him
   on the basis of the Pauline universalism, and such as he pictured to
   himself even when he read the Synoptic Gospels, filling in their
   omissions quite as a matter of course. It is quite legitimate to speak
   here of a higher historical truth, as Jesus was bound by an inner
   necessity to become the Saviour of the world. But through the
   deification of Jesus His humanity is thrust on one side and threatens
   to become a mere phantom, and that is an ominously disturbing element.
   Even in St Mark the stories of the miracles inserted because of
   apologetic interests have produced a bizarre and fantastical picture.
   In St John all this is exaggerated beyond recognition. The connection
   between Jesus and ourselves is severed if Jesus need not die but can
   take again the life which He lays down. And the relation of Jesus to
   God is no longer a pattern for us, but rather acts as a deterrent when
   Jesus thanks God merely because of the multitude which stood around
   "that they may believe that Thou didst send Me"; and when we further
   consider what theological controversies and aberrations the testimony
   here borne to the divinity of Christ has produced in the course of
   centuries, we shall consider it nothing less than fatal that a Gospel
   of the New Testament should have been the perpetual cause of this.

   The Jews are for St John the foe that is without. It is with them that
   the Church of his day engaged in a desperate struggle; it is they who
   are the cause of the greatest suffering. Hence his life of Jesus is
   almost entirely filled with controversy with the Jews. It even forces
   its way into the last discourses. And, furthermore, it is the Jews as a
   people who are hostile to Christ, not the Pharisees, not the Scribes,
   but the people as a whole, in so far as they are not believing Jews.
   The controversy has reached such a pitch of hopeless embitterment that
   they scarcely take any very great pains any longer to understand each
   other. From the very first the Jews want to kill Jesus; but Jesus never
   hopes to win them over, and never seriously endeavours to convince
   them. Between Jesus and His people there ever stands the hatred between
   the Jews and Christians of the author's own time. The first meeting in
   Jerusalem is very significant. As they behold the wonders of Jesus the
   faith of many Jews is awakened. But Jesus believed them not (did not
   trust Himself to them), because He knows all men; i.e., in the author's
   sense, because He knew they were His future murderers. Jesus associates
   with them in accordance with His knowledge. He purposely speaks to them
   in enigmatic words which they cannot understand, and which reveal the
   spiritual chasm between them. Occasionally, too, He proffers proofs of
   His divine mission; but they are mostly such as already presuppose
   faith in Him, and thus they are of none effect. Finally, He declares to
   them to their face that they are neither the children of God nor the
   children of Abraham but the children of the devil, and that, solely
   because they do not believe in Him. Moreover, faith is an impossibility
   for them because of the decree of God. Only those whom the Father
   draweth to the Son, who are given to the Son, believe. But then this
   does not apply to the Jews, because the prophecy as to their hardness
   of heart must be fulfilled. This was the reason why they could not
   believe. Besides this, to understand Jesus is impossible for them,
   because they have not the Spirit, cannot even receive Him. At bottom
   these three theories--descent from the devil, hardness of heart, want
   of the Spirit--are but three catchwords uttered in the course of the
   controversy between Jews and Christians and born of the same hatred.
   Another such catchword suggests immorality: He that cometh not to Jesus
   has to conceal his evil works from the light, he is wanting in the will
   to be good. Now if Jews and Christians are thus opposed to each other
   without any prospect of mutual understanding and reconciliation, it is
   clear that Jesus could not pray for the world--it would have been in
   vain--but only for Christians. The impression which this polemic
   produces is consistent from beginning to end. The importance which the
   author attaches to it is shown by the fact that he desired to depict
   Jesus above all else as the enemy of the Jews.

   There is no doubt that he rendered the Church of his time a service by
   this appreciation. For his contemporaries the struggle with the Jews
   raged far more violently than the struggle with the heathen state. They
   read the Gospels, they desired to understand Jesus Himself in the light
   of this struggle. The entirely different polemic of Jesus against the
   Scribes and Pharisees justified them--so they imagined--in doing this.
   They understood the woe upon the hypocritical piety of the Pharisees as
   a curse upon their unbelief. One need but read in the dogmatic contrast
   wherever the Synoptists speak of the contrast between the religious
   relation and morality, and the Jesus of the Synoptists, too, is an
   enemy of the Jews. Of course, the many traits of Jesus' pitying,
   seeking love for His countrymen, the earnest endeavour to secure their
   conversion, His devotion to them even unto death, which all pointed in
   another direction, remained standing in the Synoptists. John never
   thought of removing them; what he wanted above all was to add and to
   explain, and the fundamental feature in his picture is an addition, his
   thesis that that which separates Jews from Christians is the belief in
   Jesus as the Son of God from heaven. But along with this addition, he
   placed by the side of the picture of heartfelt kindliness,
   childlikeness, and joy, another picture, in which hatred and
   implacability stand out against love; and as a true child of his age,
   he so distorted the human form of Jesus as to make a fanatic of Him,
   and hence, ever since, made it as easy for human hatred to be kindled
   at it as divine love. And quite apart from this unbending enmity, how
   great a loss there is in the way in which Jesus has been turned into a
   theologian by these endless controversial speeches, with their
   ambiguity, which purposely provokes misunderstanding, with their proofs
   and testimonies--above all, with their continual witness to the speaker
   Himself, upon which there follows in turn an argument as to the utility
   or inutility of such a witness, and a subtle proof of the value of this
   witness in particular. This is exactly the way in which Jesus would
   have spoken had He been a theologian at the end of the first century,
   and not He who He was in reality: the layman from Galilee who wished to
   free His disciples from the theologians and to make them children,
   children of God, but who was also inspired by a love for His people so
   deep as to be altogether beyond the comprehensions of these later
   enemies of the Jews.

   The foes within are in John's eyes the heretical Gnostic teachers and
   their followers. The first epistle is entirely devoted to meet the
   danger from this quarter, but the Gospel, too, is affected by the
   consciousness of the same peril. The author, however, shows good taste
   in not suffering Jesus to speak of them anywhere, and in not drawing
   the picture of Jesus in an anti-gnostic spirit. He speaks of the
   incarnation of the Logos quite incidentally and without any polemical
   purpose, nor does he appear afterwards to be greatly concerned to
   defend this true human body of Christ against Gnostic docetism. Even in
   the accurate proofs that he offers of the death of Jesus and His
   resurrection-body, he is thinking of unbelieving Jews, not of
   unbelieving Christians. But, on the other hand, the last discourses of
   Jesus can only rightly be under stood when we conceive them to have
   been written with a view to guide the Church safely through the Gnostic
   troubles. This supposition does not deprive them of the wonderful power
   which they exercise, for the position which John occupies in his
   struggle against the Gnostics could with difficulty be surpassed. Jesus
   promises His disciples the Spirit of Truth, which is to protect them
   against the lying spirits who are mentioned in the first letter. Jesus
   admonishes them to recognize the marks of His discipleship, and the
   conditions of His fellowship in the keeping of the commandments and the
   love of the brethren; thereby He protects them against the selfishness
   of that mystical love of God of which the Gnostics boasted. Finally,
   Jesus sums up all His thoughts and wishes in the prayer for the unity
   of the Church, for the Gnostic desire for separation is the greatest
   danger which threatens the Church. All this is quite in the spirit of
   Christ. There can be no doubt of that. We can fancy that Jesus would
   have spoken thus had He been the founder of a Church, and had the first
   attempt at schism taken place in His time. Nevertheless, we do well to
   remember, as Protestants, that we owe our freedom to our having
   abandoned the Catholic idea of unity contained in the high priestly
   prayer. And the love which the Sermon on the Mount demands is far
   higher than the Christian love of the last discourses. It is not till
   we come to the First Epistle of St John that we realize the
   uncompromising character of the contest against the Gnostics. There the
   Catholics are contrasted with the Gnostics as the children of God by
   the side of the children of the devil. The counterpart of the great
   moral contrast is the dogmatic, the confession of Antichrist. The
   method pursued in the controversy is the same as that employed in the
   gospel against the Jews. There is no attempt at a compromise, nothing
   but the most outspoken condemnation. But here too it becomes manifest,
   beyond all possibility of doubt, that the disciple did not derive these
   feelings and this language from the Master, but, on the contrary, Jesus
   had to speak in accordance with John's thoughts. Now, the Gnostics who
   are St John's opponents are far from being the later celebrated Gnostic
   schools; they are the forerunners of the Gnostic movement, such as
   Cerinthus. How wonderfully, then, did both gospel and epistle meet the
   needs of the Church which was just being involved more and more deeply
   in the Gnostic controversy.

   As a tract for the times, touching upon every question of the day, and
   intended to define the position towards Jews, Gnostics, and Greeks, the
   Gospel of St John was welcome to the Church, and furthered its
   interests. If one would understand it in connection with all the moving
   forces of its age, one must forget the picture of the mystic and the
   philosopher, and call up before one's mind the ecclesiastical champion.
   Even thus, however, its world-historic importance is but imperfectly
   accounted for. How could we thus ever understand the fact that it
   became the most important of the Gospels when the disputes with Jews
   and Gnostics had long ago died away?

   The Fourth Gospel derived this importance, lasting long beyond the time
   of its birth, from its having bridged over the chasm between Jesus and
   St Paul, and from its having carried the Pauline Gospel back into the
   life and teaching of Jesus. It is only through this gospel that
   Paulinism attains to absolute dominion in the theology of the Church.
   By Paulinism, however, we do not here mean the Pauline doctrine of
   justification, or, generally speaking, the apostle's anti-Jewish
   apologetic. The whole antithetical vocabulary--law, faith; law, grace;
   law, the Spirit--was abandoned by John as it had been by the whole
   Church of his day. For the controversy as to the law was now dead and
   buried, and Christians were the more ready to forget St Paul's
   arguments, as they only served to attract reproaches of libertinism and
   antinomianism. But this anti-Jewish apologetic only forms a very small
   part of the Pauline theology; it is nothing more than an application of
   the Pauline soteriology to the controversy regarding the law. The
   soteriology itself John grasped and expounded so forcibly and clearly,
   that one is compelled to assume that he had derived lasting impressions
   from the reading of St Paul's letters. In John's hands the soteriology
   is lightened of all the ballast of rabbinical conceptions, and is set
   forth in that grand simplicity which touches the hearts of all men--the
   simplicity with which Paul the missionary knew how to move his Gentile
   hearers. Like Paul, he begins with the pessimistic position, the
   radical corruption of mankind. The world is separated from God, given
   over to sin and the devil, to darkness and the destiny of death; it is
   a lost world of sinners. He does, it is true, incidentally endeavour to
   do justice to the powers that make for goodness outside the Church,
   when he calls Jesus the light which is bound to draw to itself all good
   and pure people. But these sentences start from other premises; nothing
   like them occurs elsewhere, nor can they break their way through the
   surrounding pessimism: Without me ye can do nothing; that which is born
   of flesh is flesh. Without the second birth there is no entrance into
   the kingdom of God. Into this lost world of darkness and of death,
   light and life enter in the person of Jesus. Far as the author diverges
   in his prologue from St Paul by spreading this manifestation of light
   over a whole series of children of God before Christ, it is not long
   before he is once more in complete agreement with St Paul in the
   central importance which he attaches to the one historic fact Jesus
   Christ, in whose name they, too, all believed whom He made to be
   children of God in the ages before He came on earth. Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, is for John as well as Paul the
   core and centre of Christianity. And, moreover, John's Christology is
   Pauline in all its important features--the Son of God who was with God
   in heaven, and was sent by God upon earth, the Mediator of creation,
   the God of Revelation of the Old Testament, the Son of Man from heaven,
   as Paul, too, called Him. And the chief object of His coming into the
   world is the atonement by means of His death. From its very first line
   the Gospel centres upon Him, John the Baptist preaches the Lamb of God
   who is to bear the sins of the world. God so loved the world that He
   gave His only Son to save the world, or, as the first epistle completes
   the sentence, as a propitiation for our sins. Through His death Jesus
   has become objectively the propitiation for the sins of the whole
   world, and His blood cleanseth us from all sin. But here too the
   resurrection is immediately added to the death. Here we have the
   all-convincing proof that Jesus is the Redeemer, and can give eternal
   life itself to all who believe in Him. To this, the groundwork of the
   Pauline Christology, John adds his two modifications. By the side of
   the death of Jesus he assigns its due place to the life of Jesus, and
   he fills this life with the positive contents of the divine revelation.
   The former was the natural thing for him to do as the writer of a
   gospel: even without John the life of Jesus would have come to its due
   rights through the existence of the Synoptic Gospels. Peculiar to him,
   and at the same time in harmony with St Paul, is the way in which this
   life of Jesus always points to the death and is filled from beginning
   to end with instruction as to the value of the death. In the second he
   endeavours to meet the Greeks, for whom the idea of revelation was of
   far greater importance than for the Jews, the people of God's
   revelation from of old. Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life, He
   reveals the name of God to men, so His last prayer sums up His work.
   Hence follows the only important difference between the two
   Christologies: the picture of Christ in His glory instead of the
   picture of Jesus in His humiliation. The Jesus who would reveal God
   unto men and who would prove His Messiahship to the Jews, must manifest
   all the glory of God and of the Messiah, at any rate at certain
   definite periods of His activity. But once again John had no need to
   create this picture of the glorified Christ: he had it in the germ in
   the proof from miracles contained in the Synoptic Gospels, and needed
   but to develop it. But one is bound also to add that St John's addition
   harmonizes very well with Pauline Christology, and that the latter
   thereby alone acquires its convincing force. In St Paul's writings
   every psychological mediation is as yet wanting--the Son of God on the
   cross, the paradox, is to awaken faith by itself. It is John who is the
   first so to depict the Son of God in His life that we understand that
   God sent Him, and then having gained this assurance we are not shaken
   in our faith even by the death on the cross. And then again, in spite
   of all Hellenization, in spite of all thoughts of revelation, the
   fundamental Pauline thought ever and ever again breaks through
   triumphantly--Jesus the Redeemer. To save the world God sent Him from
   heaven. He is the Lamb of the world that bears the sins of the world,
   the Water of Life, the Bread of Life, the good Shepherd who dies for
   His sheep, the resurrection and the life. He is also the Way and the
   Truth for men who know nothing of God, but He is above all the
   manifestation of the grace and love of God which lead from death unto
   everlasting life. The strength and the greatness of the Gospel of St
   John lie entirely in this description of Jesus the Redeemer, in the
   realization of the Pauline faith in the picture of the Gospel. The
   enthusiasm and gratitude of a disciple who found in Jesus' life and
   full satisfaction are forever breaking through from the midst of
   hateful controversy and gloomy judgments of condemnation. Even the
   unrelenting bitterness with which he consigns the Jews to the devil is
   in his case the necessary converse of his devoted love to Jesus. The
   subject of his preaching, and of that which he puts into the mouth of
   Jesus, was at that time by no means something new. Every member of the
   Church believed that Jesus was the Redeemer of the world. But the
   manner of his preaching, the wonderful simplicity of his words, the
   continual return of the same burden, the exclusiveness and entireness
   of his love for the individual--that is peculiar to him: in this he has
   never had his equal.

   Whoever, like Paul, has conceived of Jesus as the Redeemer and
   Reconciler of the world, is also likely to follow Paul in his
   conception of redemption. For all that Paul teaches of the Spirit of
   God or of Christ, of faith and the sacraments, of the forgiveness of
   sins and the certainty of salvation, of predestination, one can find
   exact parallels in John, only that one feels the difference in the
   position of the Church, the approach of a new enemy, the Gnostics, in
   place of the old foe, the Judaizers, which effected a slight change in
   the point of view. Here, too, salvation comes through the gift of the
   Spirit, the birth from above. Here is the source of a new moral
   force--whosoever has the seed of God cannot sin--a new intellectual
   force, the power to comprehend the earthly and the heavenly, and to
   explain the secret of Christ and of His death from the sacred book of
   Revelation, and a new power of God's love, the testimony that God
   dwells in us, that we are children of God and sure of eternal life. All
   this is the work of the Spirit of God, who is at the same time the
   Spirit of Christ. He proceeds from the Father; the Father sends Him,
   but He sends Him in Christ's name, or the Son Himself sends Him from
   the Father. He will take of mine, for all that the Father hath is mine.
   Thus intentionally varying the expression, St John repeats St Paul's
   view still more clearly, that the divine power which redeems us is
   Christ's power and bound up with the Person of Jesus, that there are
   not two redemptions, the one from Christ, the other immediately from
   God, but the one Redemption in the communion of Christ.

   But once again following St Paul, this salvation by the Spirit is
   effected by certain means, and they are none other than those which St
   Paul knows: the Word, faith, the Church, the sacraments. The Word is
   the chief bond between Christ and Christians; it is the Word of God
   which Christ does not speak of Himself but of God, and that is why it
   brings divine power, the Holy Spirit, to men. Jesus' words are Spirit
   and Life, words of everlasting life, words of cleansing power. John
   values the sacraments as highly as did the whole Church of his time,
   but the reason is in his case a higher one. It is the Word that is the
   channel for the power of salvation, and not the element. On man's side
   faith is the necessary medium for the reception of the Spirit. In one
   place John calls it the work of God which God demands of men, but he
   does this in order to contrast it with the works which the Jews would
   do in order to obtain salvation. For him, too, faith is in reality no
   work, no effort of the human will. To believe means to be drawn to
   Christ, to be ready to receive Him. But just as here again he follows
   exactly in St Paul's footsteps, so he gives to faith the same
   ecclesiastical turn: to believe is to confess that Jesus is the
   Messiah, that He is the Son of God in the flesh. And in the battle
   which the Church wages, it all depends upon this. John speaks of this
   faith with the enthusiasm of St Paul and of the author of the Acts.
   Everlasting happiness and all other benefits of the communion with God
   depend upon this faith alone. In his first letter, where he writes as a
   simple Christian to Christians, he assigns the first place to the
   forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God. Like St Paul, St John
   tells us that they can be obtained by looking at God's love on the
   cross, and in the confident hope that Jesus is our advocate with God.
   Hence the name Paraclete, and hence the twofold application of this
   name to the Son and to the Spirit, for both are our representatives and
   our advocates with God. In the Gospel, where as an apologist he would
   win for Christ not only sinners but more especially the doers of God's
   will, those that walk in the light, he sets forth the knowledge of God
   and everlasting life as the privilege of believers. He that believes
   has everlasting life; that is St John's translation of St Paul's
   preaching: he that believes will be saved. By everlasting life he by no
   means signifies a merely inward possession, as modern theologians
   commonly speak of present immortality. It is the life which lasts
   beyond death, the beginning of the risen life, upon which the
   resurrection of the body is bound to follow by an inner necessity. Like
   St Paul, St John knows of a double resurrection, the first at baptism
   and the other at the second coming, and the latter completes the
   former. So, too, he knows of an anticipation of the judgment of the
   world in this present life. And yet the future judgment remains as
   awful an event as ever. This judgment is accomplished in the advent of
   the Redeemer and in the division of men into such as suffer themselves
   to be redeemed and such as are lost. Here we have an exact parallel to
   St Paul's doctrine of justification. Paul writes: "He that believes is
   justified, and is saved from the wrath that is to come." John writes:
   "He that believes cometh not into condemnation, but hath everlasting
   life." That is surely merely a difference of expression. As soon as the
   question is put, How must Jesus have spoken in the sense of St Paul?
   the answer can only be, exactly as He speaks in St John.

   St John agrees also with St Paul in never mentioning the Church in
   connection with his doctrine of salvation. He speaks of salvation as
   though each individual received it afresh and immediately at the hand
   of Jesus Christ. And yet he himself wished by no means to be understood
   in a mystical but in an ecclesiastical sense. The emphasis laid upon
   the Word is sufficient in itself to decide the point. Faith is kindled
   by the Word, but the Word does not come straight down from heaven, but
   through the preachers of the Church and the communion of the Church. We
   may draw the same conclusion, too, from the importance attached to the
   sacraments of the Church, with which salvation always appears to be
   very closely connected. But it is contained still more directly in the
   demand for faith; faith is the sign of the Christian Church. In St
   John's time there are no believers outside the Church: "Extra Christum
   nulla salus" means and is intended to mean "Extra ecclesiam nulla
   salus." The necessity for ecclesiastical communion is set forth by St
   John in the parable of the true vine so clearly that none of his
   readers could mistake his meaning. It is merely due to his feeling of
   fitness that he does not use the word Church when speaking of a time
   when it did not as yet exist. The parable of the vine and the branches
   has the same meaning as the Pauline parable of the head and the
   members, viz., that the Church has in Christ its centre of life, that
   each single individual derives all his strength by remaining in vital
   contact with this centre. It reminds us still more plainly, however, of
   the prayer in the Jewish communion, which is preserved for us in the
   Didache: "We thank thee, our Father, for the Holy Vine of David thy
   servant." The vine was for the Jews, just like the one loaf, a symbol
   of the Jewish Church, now scattered throughout the world but destined
   to be made one in the kingdom of God. Now, just as the Jews are
   branches of the vine of David, so are the Christians of the true Vine
   of Christ. When John therefore urges the importance, the necessity, of
   remaining in the vine, he is really calling upon the disciples to
   remain true to the word of Christ and to the communion of the Church,
   in contrast with the indifferent, nominal Christians and the Gnostic
   separatists. Hence Jesus' last words to His disciples are the
   oft-repeated fervent prayer for the unity of the Church. In any case,
   what St John wishes is not to give individual pious souls instructions
   for mystic communion with God on high, but to keep the Church in a
   living connection with its head and founder. It was this alone that his
   age asked of him.

   The mysticism which is clearly to be traced in the Gospel of St John is
   that of the sacraments. It is now referred to Jesus Himself. Even in
   Jesus' lifetime, says the Fourth Gospel, men were baptized in His name,
   though Jesus Himself did not baptize. Without this baptism there is no
   new birth, no entrance into the kingdom of God. But the one baptism is
   to be sufficient. Jesus refuses to allow any repetition of the rite.
   And in the same way He is made to declare there can be no everlasting
   life without participation in the Lord's Supper. The Father is eternal
   life, the Son lives through the Father, the Christian lives through the
   Son when he eateth Him at the Lord's Supper. This is, of course, not to
   be understood in a material sense; it is a question of spiritual food
   and spiritual drink, as St Paul calls it. Thus John adopted all Paul's
   thoughts as to the means of salvation.

   The Pauline soteriology is completed by the belief in predestination.
   St John makes Jesus proclaim this belief aloud to all men. He alone
   cometh to the faith whom the Father draweth to the Son and giveth to
   the Son. "It is not ye that have chosen Me; it is I who have chosen
   you," says Jesus to the disciples, and so furnishes the predestinarian
   interpretation to the choice of the twelve in the Synoptic Gospels. But
   he that is chosen is absolutely certain of salvation. "Nobody can tear
   him from My hand, from My Father's hand. Who can separate us from the
   love of God in Jesus Christ?" Here, however, a difficult problem arises
   owing to the changed position of affairs. For St Paul all believers
   were chosen, and the Church was the fellowship of the chosen saints.
   Could John maintain this now that so many Christians were notoriously
   evil livers, and now that the Gnostic heresy had led so many believers
   astray? It is very significant that the character of the traitor Judas
   came to be of importance to him for the solution of this difficult
   question. Judas is one of the twelve whom Jesus called; he believes in
   Him, follows Him to the end, takes part in the Last Supper. And yet he
   is a devil. Jesus never chose him, but knew from the beginning the sad
   end to which he would come. On several other occasions too John points
   out that Jews believed in Jesus even in His name whose faith was worth
   less, who were themselves the children of the devil. And then
   immediately afterwards he once more declares: "He that believeth hath
   everlasting life; no man can tear My sheep from My hand." St John does
   not give us a homogeneous and clear solution of the problem. He does
   not appear to have found one as yet. He gives us the answer of the
   later Catholic Church: It depends upon whether you remain constant in
   the truth that you have once accepted, and whether the fruits of your
   life prove the reality of your faith. According to this it is a man's
   relation to God, and not the divine decree, that decides. But he gives
   us as well the answer of all predestinarians: Judas was not chosen, and
   therefore he must needs be lost. In any case he has abandoned his
   confidence in the belief that the Church is the fellowship of the
   elect; and all those sentences which connect faith and everlasting life
   together, apparently without laying down any conditions, must be
   understood as limited by the declarations on this subject in the last
   discourses. But here again he was anticipated by St Paul, who urged
   those that stood without to believe, while those that were within were
   bidden to show forth love and to produce the fruits of the Spirit.

   Now just as John here starts from St Paul's doctrine of predestination
   and modifies it from the point of view of his own age and its
   requirements, so in other subjects too he occasionally adapts his
   Pauline basis to other thoughts and formulizations. The masses had to
   be taught the faith of the Church, the heretics and their conception of
   Christianity had to be controverted: both these requirements
   imperatively demanded consideration. Hence the Johannine soteriology is
   far less enthusiastic than the Pauline. The author of the first epistle
   is very reticent as to the Spirit. In the Gospel, too, the Spirit is
   the teacher of truth, the guarantee of ecclesiastical orthodoxy. This
   can scarcely be the author's whole meaning, but it is this that appears
   to him to be of especial importance just at present. On the other hand,
   he speaks of the commandments far more frequently and with far greater
   ardour than St Paul. He is thinking of the Sermon on the Mount, and,
   generally speaking, of the sayings of Jesus in the Synoptists. They are
   not simply the result of the Spirit's agency. They have to be learnt
   and kept as authoritative. This is not opposed to St Paul's teaching,
   for on one occasion he too designated the keeping of the commandments
   as the chiefest object in a Christian's life, and yet it is altogether
   unlike his usual method. It would be a marvel if St John did not differ
   from St Paul in this point. And yet how nearly he approaches to him
   when he calls the keeping of the commandments the fruit of the
   fellowship with Christ. In St John we never really quit the great
   apostle's mighty sphere of thought.

   The whole of the Johannine theology is a natural development from the
   Pauline. It is Paulinism modified to meet the needs of the
   sub-apostolic age. Two important consequences follow from this.

   There is no Johannine theology by the side of and independent of the
   Pauline. Luther already felt this clearly, and he understood something
   of the matter. John and Paul are not two theological factors, but one.
   Were we to accept that St John formed his conception of Christianity
   either originally or directly from Jesus' teaching, we should have to
   refuse St Paul all originality, for we should leave him scarcely a
   single independent thought. But it is St Paul that is original; St John
   is not. In St Paul's letters we look, as through a window, into the
   factory where these great thoughts flash forth and are developed; in St
   John we see the beginning of their transformation and decay. Somebody
   must surely have first created the theory of the Spirit independently
   before his successor could break off the point of it by his theory of
   the Logos. There must first have been a preaching of the cross, and the
   cross alone, before a life of Jesus was written which pointed to this
   cross from the very first. And this reasoning applies to all the rest.

   The question which now arises as to who this John was to whom the
   tradition (first to be traced in Irenaeus) ascribes these writings is,
   from a theological point of view, entirely valueless, and can only
   interest the antiquarian investigators of tradition. Ignatius, the only
   writer of the beginning of the second century who was well acquainted
   with Asia Minor, and of whom genuine writings have come down to us,
   only knows of the intercourse of the apostle Paul with the
   congregations of Asia Minor, although he has himself read the Johannine
   writings. It must, however, be admitted that this search for an
   apostolic author is occasioned by the Gospel itself, which claims to be
   written by a favourite disciple who stood even nearer to Jesus than
   Peter, the chief authority in the Synoptists. It is only through him
   that Peter learns who the traitor is, and gets into the high priest's
   court. He reaches the empty grave before Peter, and before Peter he
   recognizes the risen Lord. While Peter denies his Master, he remains
   faithful and stands beneath the cross and receives the dying Saviour's
   last testament. And this is the most calamitous, the most painful point
   in the whole writing, which only hereby obtains some thing of the
   character of a mystification. For none of these witnesses' has the
   slightest historical probability. One must have a considerable dose of
   credulousness to believe the witness of the favourite disciple and the
   mother of Jesus under the cross, and the many touching farewell words
   in contradiction to the Synoptic report of the flight of all the
   disciples, of the Marys and Salome looking on from afar, and of Jesus'
   single cry of anguish. The only fact that can be called historical is
   the attempt on the part of a number of the teachers of the Church--the
   we'--to obtain acceptation for the new account which differed from the
   Synoptic in so many particulars. We cannot tell how they reconciled
   their action with their conscience. One thing is certain--they
   succeeded completely in their attempt.

   The significance of the Fourth Gospel consists in the fact that it
   refers the teaching of St Paul back to Jesus Himself. This constitutes
   its value and its worthlessness, its force and its fatality. It is
   Jesus Himself who now tells us that everyone is lost without Him, that
   He is the only Redeemer and Reconciler for all nations and men. that
   faith in Him alone brings us the knowledge of God and communion with
   God, forgiveness of sins, confidence in prayer, and certainty of
   everlasting life. But at the same time it is Jesus Himself who now
   tells us that the Church is the channel of this salvation, that without
   the Church there is no salvation, neither for Jews nor Greeks, that the
   Christian orthodox Church is the only road to blessedness. This is set
   forth with such simplicity and clearness that the simplest intelligence
   can grasp it, and with such glowing enthusiasm that even opponents are
   carried away by it. At the same time John now tells us that the
   Synoptic Gospels--to which his own is now added as a supplement--are to
   be interpreted in St Paul's sense, and only in that sense. And thereby
   he covers up and conceals Jesus beneath St Paul and the Church. He
   makes the understanding of Jesus--the Jesus of history before the
   Church existed--impossible forever. It is no longer a question of the
   kingdom of God or of hell, of the doing of God's will in strict
   self-discipline, of childlike love and childlike trust in God, but of
   faith and the confession of Jesus as the Son of God. The contrast,
   which is henceforth to move the world, and only too frequently with
   terrible results, is no longer between good and bad, but between
   believing and unbelieving. This transposition cannot be laid to the
   charge of any single individual, not to St John, not even to St Paul.
   It was inevitable as soon as the Christian community separated from the
   national Jewish Church and limited the claim to eternal life to those
   who shared the faith in Jesus. And the drawing together of this
   community, the foundation of the Church, followed from the feelings of
   gratitude and enthusiasm of the disciples for all that they had
   received from Jesus, and was the necessary instrument in order to
   maintain the divine power of Jesus and to carry it forth into the
   world. We are everywhere met by necessary limitations to all the
   blessings and the benefits which we enjoy to this day. And yet this
   exclusiveness of the disciples was a Jewish inheritance, and not after
   the mind of Jesus. In any case, far from being a necessity, it was a
   downright misfortune that Jesus Himself was made to be the author of
   exclusiveness and fanaticism of faith as John depicted Him. For thereby
   that which is of real importance in the sight of God has been obscured,
   and Jesus' own redemptive power has been impaired by the very men who
   were the most powerful preachers of the Saviour Christ.

CHAPTER XII.

  THE FATE OF PAUL.

   OF the other writings of the second strata of the New Testament, none
   approaches even from afar to the importance of the Fourth Gospel, which
   it would not be too much to say has influenced the world's history by
   its Pauline transformation of the picture of Jesus. But yet it is
   significant, too, how the Apostle Paul and the twelve are adapted in
   these later writings to the Catholicism of the turn of the century. In
   St Paul's case the Acts and the Pastoral epistles which are based upon
   it have to be considered.

   In these writings Paul appears as the great missionary to the heathen,
   the opponent of the Jews, the ecclesiastical organizer. The Paul of
   history was all this most decidedly--only after a somewhat different
   fashion, and he was something else besides. The first point which is
   everywhere emphasized is that Paul became a Christian from being a
   persecutor of the Christians, and right from the midst of this
   persecution. Three times the story of his conversion is repeated in the
   Acts. It was a striking example for this later generation how God can
   turn the heart even of an enemy of the faith. Thus, then, it serves the
   Church as one of the most impressive stories of a conversion, but not
   as that which it really was to St Paul--the genesis of his gospel and
   his apostleship. It is indeed remarkable how completely the impression
   of his independence has been lost, and how marked the tendency is, on
   the contrary, to attach the convert firmly to the old tradition.
   Ananias, a pious Jewish Christian in Damascus, baptizes him and
   introduces him to the Christians in that town. Being not long after
   expelled thence, he comes to Jerusalem, where Barnabas brings him to
   the apostles and he associates with them. The work of Ananias appears
   so important to the author that he twice gives us a detailed account of
   it. Nothing is omitted that could serve to establish an unbroken chain
   of apostolic tradition. As Luke in all probability read the Epistle to
   the Galatians containing St Paul's own account, one can here see how
   the Epistles of St Paul were read--in a devotional and ecclesiastical
   spirit, as was only right and fair, about in the same way as they were
   read up to the days of the great F. C. Baur of T√ºbingen. But it is
   instructive to notice that our authors go still further in their
   friendly disposition towards the old tradition, for they evidently
   delight in assigning great prominence to the strong Jewish tradition in
   St Paul. In the judgment of the Acts, St Paul was not to be blamed but
   rather congratulated on having been a pious Pharisee from his youth up.
   Does he not notice in the case of Ananias himself how, judged by Jewish
   conceptions, he had been a devout observer of the law? The Pharisees
   are the men of hope; even as a Christian St Paul feels himself related
   to them. What else is Christianity but Judaism with its hopes
   fulfilled? The Christian is the true pious Jew, and therefore, as a
   Pharisee, Paul was on the surest road that led to Christianity. He only
   lacked the knowledge that in Jesus the Messiah had already come. And
   therefore he can say that he has served God from his forefathers in a
   pure conscience, as though no breach in his religious relation had ever
   taken place; and therefore he can praise Timothy for having been
   educated by his grandmother and mother in the true Jewish piety that
   was based upon the Scriptures. The revolutionary has been here
   transformed into the regular conservative. This is quite in accordance
   with Catholic modes of thought. For Catholicism can endure no
   revolution. All the dangerous elements in St Paul have been suppressed.

   The picture that is drawn of St Paul is altogether based upon this
   conception. Everything great and original, the apostleship that is of
   revelation, the new gospel of Christian liberty, the conflict with the
   twelve, the great controversy with the judaizers, has completely
   disappeared or has been smoothed away past recognition. Peter, not
   Paul, is the first missionary to the Gentiles; Paul does not go to
   heathen lands till he and Barnabas are sent by the congregation of
   Antioch. Even now he will not go to the Gentiles in the first instance,
   and it is only the opposition of the Jews that drives him to it. Then a
   division of opinion certainly does arise over the question of the
   circumcision of the Gentile Christians. The recollection of this was
   evidently too firmly imprinted in men's minds for our author to omit
   all mention of it. But the only use he makes of it is, first, to afford
   Peter and James an opportunity for the proclamation of the universal
   scope of the Gospel on the basis of the faith that alone confers
   blessing, while Paul gives an account of his missionary journeys and
   takes no part in the debate; and next to refer the origin of the
   so-called decree of the apostles to a solemn moment in the history of
   the Church. Again, one asks oneself in amazement, can this man have
   read the Epistle to the Galatians, seeing that he thus transforms the
   great controversialist and champion of liberty into a harmless
   participant in the missionary meeting at Jerusalem? And yet this letter
   was read by the Church in later ages as well, and with the solitary
   exception of Marcion, no one noticed anything. Naturally, then, the
   unedifying quarrel with Peter at Antioch, and the great Jewish
   counter-mission, together with Paul's opposition to it, were passed
   over altogether; why should we preserve these unpleasant pages in
   history? Every edifying method of treating history understands the art
   of silence in such cases.

   The picture which the book of the Acts draws of St Paul is even thus a
   mighty one. Something of the magic charm of the first Christian
   mission, with all its new outlook, its surprises, its obstacles and
   victorious progress, accompanies all the journeys of the apostle. Rich,
   invaluable material here lay to hand in the so-called "we-source," the
   travel-journal of a companion. From this we learn, amongst other
   things, that St Paul did really first turn to the Jews in order to get
   access to the Gentiles. Here our author found a foundation for his
   theory that it was in every case and always the unbelief of the Jews
   that was the occasion of the mission to the heathen, and that as a
   matter of fact it was against their will that the missionaries were led
   by God to take up their new task. It was an apologetic theory, formed
   to meet the Jewish reproach of the frivolous abandonment of the
   religion of their fathers, while at the same time it satisfied the
   Catholic consciousness which furthered the retention of the old
   tradition as long as possible. There are other instances, too, where
   valuable pieces of information appear in a special light, owing to the
   author's special method of selection. The circumcision of Timothy, the
   vow in Corinth and afterwards in Jerusalem, are not necessarily
   inventions, but the mention of them spoils the picture of the apostle,
   if all features of complete emancipation from the law are omitted. But
   what is one to say to the theology which is ascribed to St Paul in the
   speeches to the Gentiles and in his controversies with the Jews? Here
   we see the change produced by the ecclesiastical position in the case
   of a man who sincerely meant to be a disciple of St Paul. He has, of
   course, grasped St Paul's fundamental thought that Jesus was the
   Saviour of the world, and that faith in Him carries with it the promise
   of eternal life. As far as this foundation is concerned, he is a true
   follower of the apostle. But in the arguments that he produces to
   convince the Jews he differs altogether from St Paul. It is no longer
   the question of the law, the proof of the impossibility of the
   fulfilment of the law, the arousing of the feeling of despair that
   leads to faith in Jesus as the Redeemer, but the Jewish theology of the
   Messiah, the proof of the fulfilment of the prophecies in Christ. The
   only subject of controversy between St Paul and the Jews is whether
   Jesus is the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and whether the
   Messiah had to die and rise again. This is exactly the way in which
   John tries to arouse faith in Jesus. And hereby, surely, the Pauline
   preaching is deprived of all its deep dramatic and personal elements,
   and is clothed instead in the dress of an altogether trivial scholastic
   theology. And this comes about without any special fault on the part of
   the author himself. It is simply due to the entire change in the
   position of affairs: the dogmatic controversy with the Jews now
   occupies the foreground. It is only like a faint recollection of old
   times that we occasionally hear that St Paul was really persecuted by
   the Jews because of his abandonment of the law.

   The account that is given us of the oldest form of Christian life in
   the Pauline congregations is exceedingly scanty. There is no trace, for
   instance, of any attempt to draw upon the rich treasures of the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians. Nor should we ever have imagined, had we
   possessed the Acts alone, that such a thing as the enthusiasm of the
   early Christians ever existed in the Pauline congregations. The more
   significant, therefore, is the selection of the few details which the
   author does impart to us: the appointment of the elders, the last
   instructions to the deputation from Miletus with the warning against
   the false teachers. But it is just these few details of ecclesiastical
   organization which the book of the Acts presents that form the
   connecting link with the Pastoral epistles which present us with a Paul
   who does nothing but regulate the constitution of the Church and combat
   the false teachers. The Paul of the Acts and not of the Epistles is the
   starting-point here, in spite of the little difference that the bishops
   now claim that reward for their labours which the speech at Miletus had
   bidden them forego. Nor is it very edifying to see the great destroyer
   of Jewish ecclesiasticism and the creator of free communities subject
   to nothing but the Spirit, here exalted as the first example of the
   clever ecclesiastic.

   The theology of the Pastoral epistles is built upon the foundation of
   the Pauline soteriology, but goes further in a Catholic direction than
   St John. Faith in Jesus comes, as ever, first and foremost; it accepts
   the free grace of God which came down to us in the expiatory death of
   Jesus. But then love, righteousness, patience, and, generally speaking,
   good works, must at once be added to faith, if we are to attain to the
   right kind of piety. There is no mention of the Spirit in this
   connection except--and this is significant--when speaking of baptism.
   Otherwise the Spirit is confined to the officials. John would surely
   scarcely have written this. And in like manner predestination is much
   more clearly abandoned than in St John. It depends upon a man's own
   self whether he become a vessel to honour or dishonour, whether he
   purge himself or not. The Church is the great house full of saints and
   sinners. Here, too, we have a sign that the age of early enthusiasm is
   past.

   But in spite of all this it is a practical, an excellent conception of
   Christianity, one which would by no means discredit even St Paul
   himself. The author knows exactly what the Church of his age needs
   above all else in order to be steered safely through all perils and
   dangers. But as he would have had too little authority had he written
   merely in his own name, he assumes the authority of the aged apostle.
   Some few short notes of St Paul to his younger missionary associates
   may very likely have been known to him, and may have helped him to
   clothe his thoughts in a skilful dress, but at the very beginning of
   the Second Epistle to Timothy he has abandoned his r√¥le, and the
   greater part of these letters is, after all, his own addition.

   The transformation of St Paul into a Catholic ecclesiastic in the Acts
   and the Pastoral epistles was far from being attended by the important
   consequences which resulted from the exaltation of St John over the
   Synoptic Gospels. A man who served the Church with such devotion as St
   Paul had done, cannot object if she added some touches to the original
   picture in order to adapt it for her use in later times. And yet the
   world was thus deprived of some of the best and greatest elements in
   the apostle's character. It could no longer look back upon the picture
   of a man who trusted in God and conscience alone, and thence derived
   the gigantic strength to overthrow traditions and authorities in vested
   with the sanctity of centuries.

   And now the ecclesiastical teachers had only one task left at the end
   of the first century: that was to fill up the gap between Jesus and St
   Paul, to give a picture of the apostles which should fit that of the
   Paulinized Jesus and the Catholicized St Paul. The first part of the
   Acts and the "Catholic Epistles" complete this task. It was rendered
   exceedingly easy by the fact that no older written historical documents
   (composed in a different spirit) existed in the case of the twelve
   apostles as they did in the case of Jesus and St Paul, but, at most,
   all manner of oral traditions, which had no other object than that of
   glorification. For the belief was already firmly established that all
   that the Church possessed, both in matters of doctrine and of
   organization, came down from the apostles, and through them from Jesus.
   It is on the basis of this faith that the author of the Acts composes
   his book, but at the same time he describes the lives of the apostles
   from a point of view which was entirely foreign to them--that of a
   gradual transition of the gospel from the Jews to the Gentiles. First
   of all the risen Lord gives the plan of the mission: Jerusalem, Judea,
   Samaria, unto the uttermost parts of the earth. Then the feast of
   Pentecost brings us the first anticipated realization of the furthest
   aims of the missionaries, when the representatives of all nations
   listen to the preaching of Peter concerning Jesus the Messiah.

   At first, however, the scene of their missionary activity is confined
   to Jerusalem, until the increasing severity of the persecutions of the
   Jews culminates in the first martyrdom and causes the majority of the
   Christians, not the apostles, to take to flight. Now the way is open
   for the extension that was anticipated in the plan of the missions
   prefixed to the book. In a nicely-ordered succession, the conversion of
   the Samaritans--that is to say, the half Jews--is followed by that of
   the proselyte from Ethiopia, still an adherent of the Jewish religion,
   and next by that of the first Gentile, whose alms and prayers, however,
   approach him very nearly to the Jews; then comes the foundation of the
   first Gentile Christian Church at Antioch, and finally the great
   mission to the Gentiles. The history of the earliest Christian missions
   could not have taken place in accordance with a better-ordered
   programme; this is the more wonderful, as it was no carefully
   premeditated plan on the part of the leaders which led them along this
   road, but simply the force of historical circumstances. In such a
   gradual development of the mission to the Gentiles there was no room
   for any really serious conflicts to arise, and this is the point that
   appears to our author to be of the greatest importance. The conversion
   of the first Gentile is sanctioned by such a mass of divine revelations
   that the only result of resistance to it is to manifest this divine
   sanction still more clearly. But no reader can fail to derive the
   impression that had not the great Paul possessed the courage, the
   fearlessness of consequences, and the pertinacity of the revolutionary,
   his little conservative successors and disciples would still all be
   sitting to-day on the benches of the synagogue.

   The author of the Acts, of course, filled up this outline of the
   progress of Christian missions--as he imagined them to have taken
   place--with a varied series of pictures from the missionary life. A
   large amount of space is assigned to the speeches. They all reflect the
   author's theology, and after all, this is their best feature--that
   every trace of artificial archaism is wanting in them. We do not get
   the old genuine Paulinism with its antithetical abruptness in this
   portion of the book either. Only St Paul's main thought, that belief in
   Jesus the Redeemer is the sole source of salvation, is the foundation
   of every speech. As a rule the stumbling-block of the death of Jesus
   stands in the foreground; it is removed by the testimony of the
   resurrection and by the proof that both the death and the resurrection
   of the Messiah had been prophesied in the Old Testament. Next, the
   author is very fond of dwelling upon the history of the Old Testament
   as a whole, and of interpreting it from a Christian standpoint as a
   preparation for the history of Christ, thereby depriving the Jews of
   the possession of it and handing it over to the Christians. It is the
   first martyr, the man condemned for his apostasy, who at his trial
   gives the Jews the most detailed account of the history of the
   patriarchs and of Moses, with which they had been perfectly familiar
   from their childhood. The object is to convince the reader of St
   Stephen's conservative attitude and of his strict faith in the
   Scriptures. From all this we can learn a great deal as to the Catholic
   theology in this the earliest period of its growth, but nothing at all
   as to the views of the earliest Christians.

   The glorification, however, and canonization of the apostles by the
   Church, which is undertaken in these same first chapters of the Acts,
   came to be of great importance to all later times. In the gospels,
   especially in St Mark's, the oldest, the apostles fare badly enough:
   their most striking characteristic is their shortsightedness and
   obtuseness, their inability to understand Jesus. Jesus is represented
   in St Mark as great and mysterious really at the cost of the apostles.
   Here St Matthew and St Luke have already considerably toned down the
   picture in their editions. But now, in the Acts, St Luke bids us only
   look at the bright side. It is upon the apostles first and foremost
   that the Holy Ghost descended. Since then they are no longer men like
   ourselves, but God's voices. What they speak is God's word, and what
   they order God's commandment. And this applies just to the twelve, for
   it was immediately before Whit Sunday that they again attained to their
   full number. Thus constituted they are the highest authority in the
   Church next to Jesus. As such they institute the seven, they
   superintend the new mission to the Samaritans, and pronounce the great
   decision as to the question of the law in the council of the apostles
   at Jerusalem. Now, it is instructive to notice that these three
   instances of the exercise of their official power by the whole body of
   the apostles are historically untrustworthy. We have St Paul's
   contradictory report as to the council at Jerusalem. In the account
   given of St Philip in the eighth chapter every reader can feel that the
   original tradition celebrated Philip as the apostle to the Samaritans,
   and that only a later hand added the apostolic sanction with the
   artificial distinction that Philip indeed could baptize, but only an
   apostle could impart the Holy Spirit. In the account of the choice of
   the seven, we have a similar adaptation of the Hellenistic tradition
   with the object of exalting the apostles. Hence we learn that the
   author of the Acts applies his idea of the authority and significance
   of the apostolic body to traditions which knew nothing whatever about
   it.

   But apart from this, the whole conception of the increased power and
   perfection of the apostles since the day of Pentecost contradicts all
   that we know of the actual conduct of the apostles. As a matter of fact
   they were men filled with an intense love for Jesus and possessed of
   the courage of martyrs, but they were also exceedingly shortsighted in
   the face of every divinely ordained change in the position of affairs.
   They greatly increased St Paul's difficulties through their want of
   clearness and decision, through their unyielding passive resistance to
   his progressive tendencies. Pray, where was the Holy Ghost in St Peter
   when he played the hypocrite with the Jewish Christians at Antioch?
   Surely we have here an altogether untrue picture as the result of the
   bright colours which have been laid on in the ecclesiastical and
   devotional interests. Nowhere does our author present us with any
   really valuable historical information regarding the acts of these
   twelve apostles, which is sufficient proof that we are here concerned
   rather with dogma than with historical recollections.

   In like manner the meagre description of the life of the congregation,
   based as it is upon very scanty information, transfers the author's
   ideals to the old time. One such ideal is the pious frequent at ion of
   the Temple by the first Christians; he may have a subsidiary object--to
   stop the calumnies of the Jews, but he would scarcely emphasize the
   point as he does, if he did not himself find the practice edifying. The
   "being in the house of God" is for him too a part of true Christian
   piety. Another of his ideals is the community of property, which,
   without further ado, he asserts to have prevailed generally in the
   earliest age, although the old documents from which he derived his
   knowledge of this subject contradict him in this point. He was here
   carried along by a current of his age with which we are already
   familiar in Hermas and the pseudo-Clementines, and which may also have
   been met with in certain social strata outside of the Church.

   And thus he sheds a golden light upon the first age of the saints,
   which is to be a bright example to all later generations while they
   realize the distance that separates the present from this glorious
   past. Such a description, the product of faith and enthusiasm, can be
   justified even if its historical value is very small. But it is
   fortunate for us that in the Synoptical traditions and in the epistles
   of St Paul we can recognize the features of another picture which is
   less ideal, less harmonious, but on the other hand infinitely fresher
   and more vigorous, fuller of contradictions--in one word, more natural.

   When once the original apostles were acknowledged as the highest
   authority for the Gentile Churches, it was very natural that the wish
   should arise to receive letters from them addressed to the Gentile
   Christian congregations. The origin of the First Epistle of St Peter
   has not yet been explained; only one thing is clear: we have here an
   altogether Pauline letter which nowhere claims to have been written by
   St Peter and which yet bears St Peter's name at the commencement. It is
   no specially theological writing; its object is to encourage the
   Christians of Asia Minor in the State persecutions which are now
   beginning, and to urge them to retain a firm hold on the Christian
   ideal of life. But it is just this, its practical tendency, which makes
   it a valuable document for the simple lay theology at the end of the
   first century. It is a conception of Christianity such as Clement of
   Rome presupposes in his letter. But familiarity with St Paul's epistles
   has here brought about an even closer adherence to Pauline diction.
   Christ, grace, faith--these are the foundations of Christianity. The
   threefold formula even appears: chosen by God, sanctified by the Holy
   Spirit, reconciled by Christ. The struggle against Jewish legalism is
   altogether past and yet Paul's main dogma still remains, that
   redemption is through God's grace alone. And in the sacrificial death
   of Jesus this grace has become visible and tangible for us; whilst
   Jesus' resurrection gives wings to our hope. This grace of God then
   draws near to lost man in the word of the Gospel, which awakens faith,
   and in baptism brings about regeneration. On this foundation the
   Christian is to continue building in obedience, patience, hope and love
   until he attains to the promise. Now, it is not difficult to discover
   many points in which the author of the First Epistle of St Peter
   diverges from St Paul and betrays a tendency to interpret his epistles
   in a Catholic sense. St Paul is for him only one source of his piety
   and his thoughts. Another equally important source is the scriptural
   piety of the Jews of the dispersion. It is especially in the far less
   important place assigned to the Spirit and to the decay of enthusiasm
   that one recognizes the divergence between the two ages. And yet, in
   spite of all, we have here a Christianity that is altogether dominated
   by St Paul. When Luther reckoned the First Epistle of St Peter by the
   side of St John and the Epistles of St Paul as belonging to the core
   and centre of all the Scriptures, then he showed an entire appreciation
   of the facts of the case. Starting from St Paul, the epistle is
   altogether intelligible; starting from Jesus, this is by no means the
   case. And hence we are also exempted from the necessity of all further
   inquiry as to the apostolic author.

   The writings of the end of the first century lead us everywhere to the
   same result. The theology of the New Testament is Catholicized
   Paulinism. Paul is everywhere the starting-point. It is his gospel that
   now speaks to us out of the words of Jesus and the original apostles.
   As he drove the Judaists out of the Gentile Church so he has impressed
   upon it the stamp of his spirit for all time. By the side of his
   all-powerful influence none other could have existed. But his victory
   was very considerably furthered by the eminently ecclesiastical
   character of his theology with its motto, "Extra Christum, extra
   ecclesiam, nulla salus," shining in large letters above it. To this day
   it remains an impressive sight for us, how the great weighty thoughts
   of this one man force their way through in the whole of the great
   Gentile Church. And yet it is not the entire, the original, the genuine
   Paul who gained the victory, not Paul in all his unconfined freedom.
   Even upon Paul tradition laid its mighty hand as it worked on in
   silence and anonymity. Much that was of the highest importance to him
   personally was laid aside and forgotten, because it no longer suited
   the needs of another age; so, for instance, almost the entire
   anti-Jewish theology with its antithesis--the law or Christ. Other
   things, such as the great enthusiasm, the theology of the Spirit, fell
   into disrepute because the Gnostics took possession of them, and they
   were finally confined within the narrow limits of the sacraments and
   ecclesiastical offices. Their place is taken by new factors, such as
   the ecclesiastical constitution, the orthodox faith, which now acquire
   importance; or an emphasis is laid upon freedom, the commandments, and
   good works, which was foreign to St Paul himself. Finally, his picture
   is so entirely painted over and hidden away by the Acts and the
   Pastoral epistles that the Church of the following centuries knows the
   genuine Paul as little as it knows the genuine Jesus.

   One and the same process has operated in the New as well as the Old
   Testament. Both books contain that which is most original, the greatest
   and the deepest moments in the course of the long history of God's
   dealings with men: there we have the great prophets from Amos to
   Jeremiah; here the Jesus of the Synoptic tradition, and the Paul of the
   genuine epistles. But in both instances these everlasting treasures are
   combined and bound up with the writings of men of a very different
   stamp, very ordinary men, often enough entirely abandoned by the
   prophetic spirit, and thereby their influence has been impaired. The
   significance of the New Testament consists essentially in this, that it
   alone hands down to us the words of Jesus and His apostle--for whence
   else could we obtain them?--and at the same time obscures them for all
   times and so still for us. It was the greatest event in the past
   history of Christianity when Luther from his own experience once more
   discovered the true Paul, and thereby liberated one-half of
   Christianity from the prison-house of Catholic tradition. Since then
   free Protestant science has been engaged in the work of rediscovering
   the true Jesus, and thus far things are as they were of old, thanks
   above all to the dominion exercised by the New Testament, the
   inheritance of the infant Catholic Church.

PERSONAL RELIGION IN THE SUB-APOSTOLIC AGE.

CHAPTER XIII.

  THE CHRISTIAN HOPE.

   ONE is always glad to turn aside from the theology of this period to
   the personal religion of the age, for here we can trace the personal
   influence of Jesus. Never has the theology of any age been identical
   with its Christianity. Never has it been anything else than an attempt
   at harmonizing the Gospel with the spiritual force of each age. St Paul
   was a true disciple of Jesus in his conception of personal religion, of
   that which we call the life with God. It was only in his apologetics,
   in his proof of the way, the one sole way, which leads to this piety,
   that he did not keep close to his Master, but fashioned a theology of
   his own in his controversy with the Jews, which he then took to be the
   Gospel itself. So it was again in the course of the second century.
   Theological systems were often put forward so prominently that one was
   tempted to mistake them for the Christianity of that age. We can assure
   ourselves of our mistake if we trace the power of the Gospel on the
   lives of men even in this age of the growth of Catholicism.

   It is not the eschatology of the Catholic Church which we here intend
   to portray, how the spiritualism of St Paul, Jewish apocalyptic
   writings, Greek fancies as to Hades, Gnostic longing for heaven, were
   successively added to Jesus' preaching of the kingdom, and how out of
   this chaos of opinions regarding the future there gradually arose a
   firmly established eschatological dogma of the Church. All with which
   we have to do here is the influence of this hope on the emotions and
   imaginations, and consequently upon the practical life. Though the
   conceptions are entirely different, the hope remains the same in its
   intensity and fervour, and conversely we may trace the identical
   eschatological dogma with varying degrees of zeal and enthusiasm. And
   besides this, however much the eschatologies may differ, they all agree
   in one principal point. Unlike the modern idea of the kingdom of God,
   they never take the future history of this earth into account. Even the
   millenary theory clings to the old opinion that the kingdom of God on
   earth will be brought about by wonders and catastrophes. No Christian,
   no Gnostic even, ever built up his hopes on anything but a supernatural
   basis.

   Had the promises, however, which Jesus had made in the first instance,
   and St Paul had confirmed, been fulfilled? Jesus had promised certain
   of His disciples that they should not taste death until they had seen
   the kingdom of God come with power. In like manner His contemporaries,
   especially His judges, were to witness His second coming.

   Paul wrote to the Corinthians, "We shall not all die, but we shall all
   be changed"; and to the Romans, "Now is salvation nearer to us than
   when we first believed. The night is far spent; the day is at hand."
   Not one of these promises was fulfilled.

   It is true that the destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem confirmed
   one of Jesus' prophetic words. But the second coming did not, as was
   expected, follow immediately thereupon. All the evangelists, from the
   first to the last, try in their narratives to meet the difficulties
   occasioned by the disappointment, i.e., the postponement of the coming
   of Jesus. In the old apocalyptic pamphlet, dating from the sixties,
   which Mark has inserted in his eschatological discourses, there stood
   originally, in all probability, "Immediately after the tribulation of
   those days cometh the Son of man"; but Mark omitted the word
   "immediately." Following the prevailing mood of his day Luke reports a
   sad utterance of the Lord. "The days will come when ye shall desire to
   see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it." Jesus had
   spoken of the unexpected coming of the Master by night. Luke describes
   the impatience of his age, if He shall come only in the second watch or
   even only in the third. He revises Mark's eschatological discourse so
   that the date of the second coming is postponed. "These things must
   needs come to pass first, but the end is not immediately." Between the
   destruction of Jerusalem and the Parousia he inserts the seasons of the
   Gentiles.

   In answer to the question, "Dost Thou at this time restore the kingdom
   to Israel?" St Luke makes even the risen Lord to give an evasive
   answer, and when Jesus ascends to heaven shortly afterwards the angels
   do not, according to St Luke, say to the disciples: "You shall see Him
   come again in like manner as you saw Him ascend," but only "He shall so
   come again in like manner as ye beheld Him." This conclusion of the
   life of Jesus in St Luke cannot fail to remind us of that in St
   Matthew, which is composed in an exactly similar spirit: "So I am with
   you alway, even unto the end of the world." In fact the first
   evangelist expresses the delay of the great event no less forcibly than
   the third in the parable of the wise and the foolish virgins. The
   bridegroom defers his coming. Some of the virgins fall asleep. Instead
   of the longed-for golden age the Christians have to face evil days of
   trial: the love of many shall wax cold. And the reason is just the
   postponement of the coming. But for all that the first age hoped and
   continued to hope. When one disciple of Jesus after another died and
   thus tasted of death without having seen the kingdom of heaven, then
   all remaining hope was centred upon the last handful of survivors. It
   would seem that one John (probably not the son of Zebedee to whom Jesus
   promised the martyr's death) survived all the other disciples, so that
   the Christians began to say to each other, "This disciple will not die
   before the Parousia." Finally he, too, died, and the fourth evangelist
   hastened to remove from Jesus the reproach of an unfulfilled promise.
   But a similar legend was also in circulation concerning St Peter. Words
   of Jesus were handed down which purported to have been addressed to
   him, such as "The gates of Hades shall not prevail against thee"; or,
   "Verily thine eyes shall never to all eternity be closed unto the light
   of this world." This hope, too, turned out to be deceptive. The sayings
   of Jesus were either laid aside or only entered into the canon in an
   entirely changed form. Like the discourse of Jesus concerning the last
   days, other eschatological passages in ancient writings had to be toned
   down as the expected end of the world did not arrive. In the Epistle of
   Barnabas we find this passage: "The whole time of our faith will profit
   us nothing if we do not withstand, as it beseemeth the children of God,
   now in this godless age and in the tribulations that are to come, so
   that Satan find no entrance." Compare with this the form of this saying
   in the apostolic Didache: "The whole time of your faith will profit you
   nothing if ye attain not to perfection in the last age." The very word
   that gave life to the saying, the "now," has been omitted. And in like
   manner the Didache concludes with the dogmatic saying, "Then the whole
   world shall behold the Lord coming upon the clouds of heaven." The
   "whole world," not, as we find in the earlier version, "you" or "we."

   It is worth noting all these little utterances of hope disappointed or
   deferred, very carefully. They prove to us that the authors of these
   writings were no mere heedless copyists, but took an exact account of
   the difference between the actual course of events and prophecy. Jesus
   did riot come. The kingdom of God was still in the future. Now whilst
   the evangelists tried to forget their disappointment by setting up the
   theory of postponement, many Christians began to murmur, some secretly,
   others openly, because of their deceived expectations. Our oldest proof
   of this is the Epistle to the Hebrews. The people to whom it is
   addressed were on the point of giving up the Christian hope. They
   appealed to the fact that a whole generation of Christians had died,
   "not having obtained the promises nor received salvation." Hence the
   whole edifice of Christianity struck them as mean and poor. There were
   lofty promises but without any guarantee, and the result was deception.
   From the last decade of the first century onwards ecclesiastical
   writers have continually to take account of such murmurs and such
   doubts. In an apocryphal passage quoted by the two so-called Epistles
   of St Clement, we read of sceptics who say: "Such things we heard in
   the time of our fathers already, and lo, we have become old and nothing
   thereof has come to pass." If the authors of the two Epistles of St
   Clement quote this saying and endeavour at the same time to allay the
   uneasiness expressed therein, then the inference is that similar doubts
   were expressed in their own day. In the Second Epistle of St Peter we
   read of mockers giving utterance to doubts of much the same nature.
   "Where is the promise of His coming? For from the day that the fathers
   fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
   creation." Those to whom the Epistle of St James was addressed are
   likewise deceived and have become impatient. They are forever hearing
   the word soon, but it never came to pass. Very much the same state of
   things may be inferred from the Didache, the Epistle of St Barnabas,
   the "Shepherd" of Hermas. Everywhere the doubt is expressed: "Is it
   true after all?" We may perhaps draw a very far-reaching conclusion
   from these scattered indications. A very large portion of Christians
   felt all the force of this deception, and hence lost all joy and
   courage. That is why the Christianity presupposed in the Churches by
   the Pastoral epistles, the letter of St James, Hermas, and other
   writings, is so nerveless, indifferent and frivolous. It could not
   overcome this great deception.

   All the more admirable because of this background of doubt and despair
   are the joyful gladness and the full assurance of hope which speak to
   us from most of the writings of the teachers of the Church. Even though
   the kingdom is not yet come and the Parousia delayed, hope still abides
   firm and triumphs over all doubts and scruples. Nearly all the catholic
   letters and the apostolic fathers are full of plain indications: it is
   the last time. Most of them agree in seeing in this last time the
   beginning of the great tribulation with the last terrible temptations
   for Christians. Otherwise they often differ greatly in the vivacity and
   energy of their hope, but only to prove their truthfulness; for in
   hoping, each preserves his individual character.

   Some Christians--there will probably have been a great number of
   them--live rather in fear of the coming judgment than in hope of mercy:
   so the prophet Hermas and the preacher to whom the Second Epistle of St
   Clement is to be ascribed. Hermas never really got quit of the Jewish
   uncertainty of salvation. Even as a Christian he is full of anxious
   fear, and is acquainted with every feeling but that of confidence. The
   revelation, too, which he receives, "Fulfilled are the days of
   repentance for the saints," must have greatly increased his sense of
   responsibility for the future life and therefore his anxiety. He
   realizes that whole classes of Christians will not enter the kingdom.
   To which does he belong? The end alone will show that. Then he sees the
   great tribulation approach in the shape of the hostile beast. True, he
   fights his way through bravely enough in the spirit, but only at the
   cost of the most anxious care. He knows nothing of eager longing. The
   only thing that he wishes is a clear separation between sinners and the
   righteous. The Second Epistle of St Clement shows us how a Christian
   preacher declares his message of judgment, and summons to repentance
   his readers, entangled as they are in a maze of sins, and given over to
   worldliness. He does indeed begin with God's promises and the need of
   thankfulness, but he is only in his own element when he threatens. As
   long as we are still here upon earth let us repent, for when once we
   leave this world there is no longer any possibility of repentance. Then
   he summons up the day of judgment to his readers fancy and the end of
   the world in flames, and pictures to them the dismay of the sinners and
   the triumph of the righteous. Nothing can save us from everlasting
   punishment if we obey not God's commandments. We have no advocate with
   God. Each man receives according to his deserts. Such were the thoughts
   of the majority of the Christians. At bottom their Christianity was the
   Jewish and pagan fear of the unknown terrors of retribution after
   death--nothing better.

   In other Christians hope assumes the shape of a firm, quiet, even
   somewhat dogmatic belief in requital. To this number belong the authors
   of the First Epistle of Clement and of the Epistle of James, and Justin
   Martyr. None of these are acquainted with any real longing for
   perfection, though James comes very near to it. Apart from this, too,
   thoughts of the return of Christ with all its dramatic concomitants and
   their appeal to the fancy, enter but little into their hope. The word
   requital contains everything for them. Sinners are to be punished, the
   just and righteous shall inherit the promises and become partakers of
   God's grace--that is to say, the grace they have earned. This faith in
   requital is strong enough to become a real living power, for it places
   the whole of this life in the presence of eternity. But it seldom
   inspires the soul with that glad rejoicing, that anxious expectancy,
   that impatience with which St Paul hoped. Nor is there anything
   distinctively Christian in it. Jews and Stoics met in the same faith in
   requital--the parables and commandments of Hermas, mainly Jewish in
   their character, are one of our chief authorities in this matter. The
   First Epistle of Clement dates from the end of the first century. How
   very rapidly, therefore, did the first wild enthusiastic hope cool down
   and assume a rigid dogmatic shape. Here the form was already found
   which assured the thought of eternity a place in the Christian life
   after the fading away of all dramatic fancies. This belief in requital
   was proof against all disappointment caused by the delayed Parousia.

   Hope's real heartfelt tones are heard most seldom where the
   ecclesiastical interests of the present entirely engross the writer.
   This applies to the author of the Pastoral epistles. He, too, is of
   course a man of hope, as were all the early Christians; when he thinks
   of the duty of martyrdom he utters even enthusiastic words of hope. But
   when he is fighting the Gnostics all along the line, or when he is
   establishing the constitution of the Church, his thoughts seldom go
   beyond the task of the present moment. It was difficult for such an
   eager worker in the cause of ecclesiastical order and discipline to
   think that all this was merely a provisional measure for possibly a
   week or two. In His own time God shall show the appearing of the Lord
   Jesus Christ. The writer is not to be blamed for this attitude: the
   time was not one for idle expectation, but for a strenuous struggle for
   the right. Nevertheless he affords us an illustration of the truth that
   zeal for the Church and longing for the kingdom are not easily
   combined, or at least not in a like measure.

   The author of the Johannine writings, an opponent of the Gnostics just
   as much as the pseudo-Paul of the Pastoral letters, is his exact
   contrary in one point. He is not very greatly concerned in the
   Church--as an external organization--and her ordinances. But as an
   immediate consequence of this he is filled with a mighty longing and an
   earnest expectation. He clearly realizes the provisional character of
   all personal conditions--even that of our relation as children to the
   heavenly Father. He reminds worldly Christians of the fact that the
   world perishes with all the lust therein, whilst the moral personality
   alone endures forever. But to the serious-minded, too, he exclaims: "It
   is not yet made manifest what we shall be. When He is manifested we
   shall be like Him, for we shall see Him even as He is." That is a cry
   of earnest expectation which reminds us of Paul. It is true indeed that
   the great judgment day precedes the opening of the doors of
   blessedness, a day on which many of the Lord's slothful servants shall
   be put to shame. But our author's aim is that he and his friends shall
   have entirely done with the religion of fear and anxiety. The Christian
   is to be able to come into the presence of his Lord with courage and
   confidence and with true joyfulness. And that he can do, as soon as he
   stands rooted and grounded in love, in the love of God to him, and in
   his love to the brethren. He that loves has nothing to fear on the day
   of judgment. In consequence of this glad certainty of salvation,
   everlasting life comes to be for him a sure and present possession. The
   Christian has everlasting life now; he does not look for it as
   something uncertain, a something that will perhaps fail him, but he is
   absolutely assured of it. Neither death nor judgment can terrify him.
   Every sentence in epistle or gospel about life everlasting is a
   sentence of hope. The only point in which John is distinguished from
   most other Christians is in the stronger emphasis which he lays upon
   the certainty of his hope, and--as this hope lies in the present--upon
   the joy of this hope. He is one of those great men who can walk
   securely upon earth because heaven is a certainty to them. The awaking
   of Lazarus expresses his own hope very impressively. Death is a sleep;
   even though the body decay and begin to stink, what matters that?
   Christ has power on the last day to summon forth body and soul from the
   grave by a loud word. This belief is of supreme importance for the age
   of the martyrs in which the author now lives. Christ is the
   resurrection and the life; he that believeth on Him, even though he
   die, yet shall he live. With such a faith as this it was worth going
   forth to meet death.

   In fact, persecution was the strongest impulse of all for the renewal
   of hope. At such times all the old Christian longing for the future
   burst into flame again. It is evident now that without hope the
   Christians are the most wretched of men. All manner of temptations,
   sufferings and tortures threaten them. Only he that hopeth can
   overcome. The First Epistle of St Peter is written with the object of
   awakening congregations that are in the midst of persecution to an
   ardent, earnest hope. It sets before them the greatness of this last
   great time of trial. For them that confess Christ there is consolation,
   for nominal Christians condemnation. Now the end must be awaited in
   prayer and in striving after righteousness, for the devil is going
   about like a roaring lion and is seeking whom he may devour. But our
   author is one of those Christians whose fear has been entirely cast out
   by their enthusiasm. "Praised be God, who begat us again unto a living
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." The phrase "to
   give an answer concerning the hope that is in you," instead of "your
   faith," shows us to what an extent this hope is his one and all.

   The somewhat earlier Epistle to the Hebrews was written during dark
   days, when the hearts of men failed them because the promise tarried
   and doubts arose and joy was crushed. That which gives St Peter's
   Epistle its force and fire, the terrible earnestness of the struggle
   for life and death, is wanting here. The author of this Epistle is a
   man who looks back wistfully to the golden age of persecution, and
   would possess the martyr's courage and the martyr's hope in full
   measure, should the call come to him. The tedious dryness of the
   Melchizedek theories gives way at once to heartfelt tones of longing
   and enthusiasm as soon as he touches that which is his inmost
   possession, his hope. Even in the midst of learned disquisitions the
   reader is interrupted by the call: "Awake and look forward. He is
   coming. Hold your hope firm until the end." This hope really
   constitutes his religion. Just like the author of the First Epistle of
   St Peter, he speaks of the confession of hope instead of the confession
   of faith. And as some of those to whom he was writing began to complain
   that the hope was never fulfilled, that Christians died without having
   inherited the promise, he added his well-known 11th chapter, in which
   he draws up the long roll of the Old Testament men of faith, down to
   Jesus. All of them were men of hope, all were apparently deceived; but
   their hope possessed vigour enough to overcome all deceptions. Here,
   too, he finds the simplest words for his longing. Here we have no
   continuing city, but we seek one to come. We are strangers and pilgrims
   upon earth, on our way to our home on high. "There is a land of pure
   delight": that and many another similar strain has its source in the
   Epistle to the Hebrews.

   As we should naturally expect, Christian hope assumes its boldest,
   often its wildest, guise in the martyrs themselves a short time before
   their death. The bent of Ignatius mind, like that of the author of the
   Pastoral epistles, is ecclesiastical, and therefore, in so far, his
   nature is of this world. Even on his last journey when he is being
   conveyed to martyrdom, ecclesiastical concerns occupy him to the full.
   His six letters addressed to Asia Minor are almost wholly filled with
   the measures that are to be taken in the prosecution of the struggle
   against the Judaists and Docetae, and with the striving to subject the
   Churches entirely to the bishop. Nevertheless hope appears far more
   distinctly here than in the Pastoral epistles. The difference arises
   from the fact that here we have a martyr speaking to us--one who knows
   that within a few weeks he will be standing face to face with eternity.
   The writing addressed to Rome is the classical document for the
   martyr's enthusiasm of this age. Ignatius' one anxiety is lest certain
   members of the church should use their influence at the court and
   obtain his pardon. He begs the Romans to be sure not to do that. His
   one longing is to come to God as soon as possible--never mind how
   terrible the road. To come to God and to rise from the dead is
   identical for him. The intervening space between his death and the last
   day is non-existent for him. He has bidden farewell to everything here
   below. "Nothing in this world of sense is good." "The pleasures of this
   world, the kingdoms of this dispensation, shall avail me nothing.
   Better to die and be with Christ than to rule over all the ends of the
   earth. I seek Him who died for us. To Him would I go who arose from the
   dead for us. I am near to be born again; hinder me not to live; do not
   wish me to die." "My love is crucified; there is no fire within me that
   loves mere matter, but there is living water that speaketh to me and
   that saith to me from within: Up and to the Father.'" "The wild beasts
   are the road to God." The language which the martyr uses is of course
   somewhat extravagant. Yet who can tell all that passes in the soul of a
   man doomed to certain death? Polycarp's prayer, which is handed down to
   us in the acts of the martyrs, and which he is said to have uttered
   while tied to the stake, is far more composed and calm. Both in its
   tone and language it harmonizes with the character of sane sobriety
   which we gather Polycarp to have possessed from this letter. It runs as
   follows: "I praise Thee that Thou didst deem me worthy of this day and
   hour, that I should be of the number of Thy witnesses and partake of
   the cup of Thine anointed to the resurrection of everlasting life both
   in soul and body, in the immortal spirit. May I this day be received
   among them as a well-pleasing sacrifice such as Thou hast before
   prepared and before revealed and made ready. Thou the only true God,
   Thou who liest never." If the prayer is genuine, then we would infer
   that Polycarp had no stock of original ideas or words standing at his
   command. He is in every respect a Christian of the old tradition--but
   then how high an opinion we must form of a tradition which inspires a
   man at the stake with a prayer breathing such quietness and confident
   hope.

   The hope of the early Christians had its limitations, no doubt, and
   there was an element of hostility to the world in it. No thoughts of
   progress can be traced back to it. The gradual amelioration of the
   world, the interpenetration of every sphere of life with the Christian
   spirit, the growth of a new Christian humanity, were unfamiliar ideas
   to the Christian of the first age. "The world is rotten ripe for
   change": that is the motto of most Christians, at bottom of the
   millenarians, too, who expect the transformation of the world to be
   brought about by tremendous catastrophes. In all this we can trace the
   influence of an old civilization fast hastening to decay. The little
   company of harried and persecuted Christians could not fancy that they
   would one day come to play a great part in the history of humanity.
   Their citizenship was in heaven. Here upon earth they lived as
   strangers and sojourners, as pilgrims to their heavenly home.

   But what a mighty power there lay in this future hope. It achieved two
   memorable results: it overcame the deceived expectation as to the
   coming of Jesus and the kingdom of God. Men like the author of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews and the Johannine writings derive such joy and
   confidence from their hope that the element of time, the question
   whether we come to Jesus or whether Jesus comes to us, is a complete
   matter of indifference to them. And still more these men recognized
   that longing would cease to be longing if an attainable goal were set
   before it here upon earth. In the next place hope overcame the fear of
   death. Christ delivered all them who through fear of death were all
   their lifetime subject to bondage. Hope made of the Christians a people
   of martyrs who looked upon death as sleep and made light of all threats
   and tortures. Lastly, we have this great gain which serious-minded
   Christians drew from hope for their present life. Life in the light of
   eternity must itself become a life in the Eternal, in God, and in the
   good. Moral discipline, earnestness, self-denial, freedom from the
   world, are all fortified by this resolute looking forward to the
   judgment and the vision of God. It is true that this applies not to the
   general mass of the Christians, but only to the serious-minded.

   Whilst theology underwent a complete transformation through its
   alternations of controversy and agreement with Jews, Greeks, and
   Gnostics, hope, the main element in personal religion, remained the
   same. The Christianity that hopes is the Christianity of the early
   days. The martyrs Polycarp, Ignatius, and Justin take up exactly the
   same attitude to the present and the future, to death and to life, as
   Paul and Jesus did a century before. When the flame of hope flickers or
   actually goes out, Christianity is immediately extinguished with it.

CHAPTER XIV.

  THE CHRISTIAN MODE OF LIFE.

   FROM the very first there was a sharp distinction between the
   Christianity that was actually lived in the churches and the
   Christianity which the teachers of the Church postulated in their
   writings. It is the old chasm between the real and the ideal. The
   higher and the purer the ideal, the greater the divergence was bound to
   appear the more severe the criticism to be applied. That which is
   called worldliness did not make its way into Christianity through decay
   from some high level of excellence. It came through the mission itself
   as each new convert brought in a portion of the world along with him,
   and could not be raised at once to the level of the morality of the
   Gospel. Even in the apostolic age the world thus obtained a firm
   footing in the congregations, only it was, as a rule, still more or
   less concealed by the enthusiasm of the first love. There may of course
   have been isolated ideal congregations, but never an ideal Church. The
   First Epistle of St Clement gives us, it is true, a picture of the
   Church of Corinth which is painted in an altogether ideal light;
   everything was perfect in this church--faith, piety, hospitality,
   knowledge, order, humility, unity, and charity--a magnificent picture.
   The descent from these heights to the actual reality a little later
   appears truly lamentable. But we may consider most of this description
   to be due to the vivid colouring of Greek rhetoric, the aim being to
   accentuate the contrast as much as possible. It is Paul and not Clement
   who presents us with a true picture of the Christianity of the
   Corinthians. It is true that in the sub-apostolic age we shall have to
   speak of an increase of worldliness. Enthusiasm, the first love, grew
   cold, and the position was rendered still more critical by the entrance
   of great multitudes into the Church. In some places worldliness flaunts
   about without either shame or attempt at concealment, so that the sharp
   line of distinction between the world and the congregations was
   obliterated at a very early date. Then came the distraction consequent
   upon the Gnostic controversies, which completely disorganized the
   congregations and often produced actual schism. The subsequent
   persecutions should have favoured a moral renovation; instead of this
   they frequently rather encouraged apostasy and hypocrisy. Nearly all
   the writings of our period bear witness to the great damage wrought by
   this process of worldliness, most of all the Pastoral epistles, the
   epistle of St James, and the "Shepherd" of Hermas. Decay set in among
   the leaders, and thence made its way through the whole of the
   congregation down to the newly-converted proselytes. Many of the old
   itinerant preachers, no longer exposed to the privations of a
   missionary's life in a heathen country, were the first to deteriorate
   in the shameless enjoyment of their privileges and in fanatical
   insubordination. This brought the Spirit' into discredit, and the place
   of the free teacher was taken by the permanent official. It soon became
   evident, however, that the presbyters were themselves in many cases too
   degenerate to be equal to the new and exacting claims that were made
   upon them. The author of the Pastoral epistles has to remind them of
   the elementary claims made by decency and order. Drunkenness,
   covetousness, coarseness, impurity, disorder in their own households,
   seem to have been found only too often even amongst the ruling elders.
   Such men exposed the Christians to the mockery of the heathens, and
   could acquire no authority in the congregations. It sometimes happened
   that proselytes were made bishops immediately after baptism, and then
   "being puffed up, fell into the condemnation of the devil." It is
   possible that the earnest admonitions of the Pastoral epistles
   contributed to bring about a real improvement in the state of the
   officials. A comparison with the demands which Polycarp makes of them
   points to this conclusion. But examples of bad shepherds were not
   wanting even in later times, and it is from Polycarp himself that we
   hear how a certain presbyter named Valens and his wife caused great
   scandal at Philippi, especially by their covetousness, but also in
   other ways. Hermas complains at Rome of deacons who deprived widows and
   orphans of their means of subsistence and contrived to profit thereby
   themselves. It was indeed a calamity for the Christian Church that from
   the very first the officials in the congregations frequently fell so
   far short of the ideal of their office. Complaints against priests and
   bishops are as old as Christianity itself. With the Gnostic movement
   came recrimination and competition amongst the office-bearers. Many
   congregations split asunder. Conventicles of the Gnostic prophets were
   held by the side of the principal assembly under the bishop. Even where
   there were no Gnostics, as in Hermas' time at Rome, there were other
   false prophets of a similar nature who prophesied in secret and worked
   against the bishops. When the dividing line between orthodoxy and
   heresy had been clearly drawn and peace thereby restored to the
   Catholic congregations, it turned out that the bishops had serious
   rivals in their own congregations in the shape of the saints. Amongst
   all non-ascetic admirers of the ascetic ideal the ascetic was esteemed
   more highly than the priest. But the sanctity of these saints
   themselves--and the widows were counted as belonging to their
   number--was often of a somewhat fragile character. At a very early date
   we hear of widows in receipt of the charity of the congregation by
   reason of their honourable title, who nevertheless lived in luxury or
   simply went out in quest of a husband. It was so comfortable and
   profitable to be called widow that many women had themselves enrolled
   in the sacred order though they possessed means enough to support
   themselves and their children. Later on, the bishops had to meet yet
   another form of competition. Able teachers founded schools which became
   the intellectual centres of the congregations, to the great annoyance
   of many of the official leaders.

   If the leaders instead of resisting the progress of corruption had
   often enough themselves given way to it, we cannot be surprised if we
   find that the condition of the congregations had, speaking generally,
   deteriorated considerably at a very early date. We can already see the
   different classes of Christians with their special class sins. Amongst
   the women, the love of dress and finery increases to such an extent
   that it passes the bounds of decency. They are great gossips into the
   bargain. The warning of the letter to Titus addressed to the older
   women, that they should not suffer themselves to be enslaved by drink,
   gives rise to serious reflections. The rich and well-to-do soon
   degenerate into a merely nominal worldly Christianity. St James attacks
   them with such vehemence that the reader of his epistle is bound to ask
   himself whether his severe strictures are not intended for people
   outside the Church altogether. But St James is not writing for such; he
   really means rich Christians. They blaspheme the Christian name, for
   they do violence to the poorer brethren of the faith, and drag them
   before tribunals because they love gold more than God. They keep back
   the wages of the labourers who have reaped their fields, and so are the
   cause of the sighs of vengeance which mount up to God from these men.
   But they continue their life of careless extravagance and luxury. Such
   is the picture of the rich men of his day drawn by a brave teacher of
   the Church not quite one hundred years after Christ. Hermas confirms
   the statements of this call to repentance by the description which he
   gives of the state of things at Rome. For him, too, the rich and the
   merchants are the chief representatives of worldly Christianity. When
   the merchants are on their journeys they are engrossed in their
   business and do not consort with the brethren. The rich do likewise,
   for fear lest they should be importuned for charity. It often happens
   that Christians suddenly become rich through some lucky turn of
   affairs, and gain reputation among the heathen. Then they assume an
   overbearing demeanour, they cease to attend the meetings, and
   henceforth consort with the heathen. Nor is the argument invalidated by
   the fact that Hermas very possibly borrowed it from some Jewish author.
   He applied it to his Christians. The conclusive consideration in this
   judgment of Hermas is the fact that association with the mostly poorer
   and less honoured Christians is felt to be a burden by the rich. The
   lower classes, however, are seen to have their signs of worldliness
   just as much as the upper. It was especially the slaves who caused
   serious-minded preachers to feel much anxiety. You might often have
   sought in vain for the most elementary morality. Slaves robbed their
   masters, or they cheated them and so endangered the good reputation of
   the congregation. Even if a Christian slave belonged to a Christian
   master the difficulties of the situation were rather aggravated than
   diminished. The slaves began to long for emancipation; they looked upon
   themselves as on a level with their masters, or even superior to them
   if they were better Christians.

   In addition to these sins peculiar to separate classes, were the signs
   of increasing worldliness common in a greater or less degree to all
   Christians in general. It would seem to be natural to assign the first
   place here to unchastity, seeing that in so many writings of this
   period this is the first sin against which Christians are warned. If we
   remember that the demand of the Gospel for the strictest chastity now
   came into collision with the tolerance extended by heathen antiquity to
   every form of impurity, and even of bestiality, we should not be
   surprised to find that unchastity in every shape and form caused the
   Churches a great deal of serious trouble. Yet this is not the case, or
   at any rate not to any considerable extent. The place assigned to the
   demand for chastity is due to the influence of Jewish tradition. In
   itself it does not afford us any proof as to the actual condition of
   the congregations. In the Christian writings themselves the struggle
   against the coarser sins of the flesh appears to be far less prominent
   than in St Paul's writings. We hardly ever meet with excuses such as he
   had to rebuke at Corinth. It was not so much immorality as the
   excessive chastity of many Christians which was the danger that
   threatened the congregations. For it was not only the Gnostics who
   looked upon entire continence as the sign of Christian perfection. It
   was the ideal of a good many orthodox Christians as well. Ignatius
   urges Polycarp to admonish the Christian women not to refuse the
   performance of their conjugal duty. This presupposes a struggle between
   the ascetic ideal and family life in many houses. We know that in St
   Paul's time there were spiritual betrothals at Corinth between a
   Christian man and a maiden. In the sub-apostolic age we come across the
   dangerous custom of Christian brothers and sisters sharing one bed.
   Hermas plainly alludes to the practice, and there is also a somewhat
   enigmatic passage in the Didache which appears to presuppose it. Surely
   the only result of such ascetic tours de force was that a new gate was
   thereby opened for immorality. How often, indeed, are impure tendencies
   concealed under the cloak of religion. Or if devotional literature
   began to busy itself with the fabrication of stories of the conversion
   of great sinners--men and women--or of the preservation of chastity
   amid all temptations, then it took the enemy whom it combated into its
   own bosom. The introduction of the "Shepherd" of Hermas, too, betrays a
   curious kind of devotional taste. He sees his former mistress bathing
   and helps her in her ablutions. Then the thought occurs to him, "Had I
   but a wife of such beauty and such a character."

   This excessive chastity, however, was probably only the aim of
   individual members of the congregations. On the other hand, the
   opposite reproach of the so-called dipsuchi'a, the weak
   half-heartedness which could not come to any clear decision either for
   or against Jesus, affected whole classes. The Christian hope, the life
   of prayer, Christian morality, all suffered grievous loss through this
   indecision and hesitation. The dividing line between Christianity and
   the world was thereby often obliterated even more than by gross sins.

   Another marked sign of worldliness was the decrease in
   public-spiritedness in many Christians. The apostolic age had been
   characterized--so St Paul himself tells us--by a deep concern for the
   good of the community. The apostle's congregations were nurseries of
   the love which Jesus had brought into the world. In the sub-apostolic
   age complaints are rife concerning the poor attendance at public
   worship and the separation of this person or group of persons from the
   other. Gnostic theories exercised a pernicious influence in this
   direction. They incited Christians to a kind of religious epicurism:
   they were to cut themselves loose from all worldly ties and live in
   complete isolation of the soul. They gave no thought to love, i.e., to
   the poor, the sick, prisoners, the hungry; works such as these were
   good enough for respectable' Christians who had not the Spirit. But
   even where there were no Gnostics there was not very much more public
   spirit. Those for the most part kept faithfully together who were in
   need of support. The others, the worldly-minded, frequently went their
   own way in search of honours or of riches. There was, however, a
   certain element of necessity in this decay of the concern for the
   public weal. The life of the community flourished at a time when there
   were as yet no Christian families, no Christian slave-owners, and the
   individual could therefore only live and subsist in the community. But
   as soon as Christianity penetrated deeper into the world, and
   consequently into the natural forms of association which had existed
   long before, the common life gradually lost its central signification.
   In such times of transition the great disadvantage of the change is
   often all that is noticed, whilst men's eyes are blinded to the ground
   that has been won. And yet this was the way which the development of
   Christianity followed. Little by little the communities became
   superfluous, subsisting only as associations for worship, until the
   need for them arose spontaneously again later on under altered
   circumstances.

   The rapid increase in the Hellenization of Christianity, a process
   which was greatly accelerated by the Gnostic confusion, brought with it
   a danger of a quite peculiar nature. Greek Christians lost, or rather
   they never acquired, the sense that Christian piety is something
   altogether practical and simple. They took an exaggerated delight in
   speculation and disputation. These Greeks made the objects of the
   Christian faith the aim of their intellectual devices, just as every
   rhetorician chose his subject. They found something at once instructive
   and amusing in the fact that they had now received new problems from
   these barbaric Orientals. Hence it was that so many crowded into the
   profession of teacher. Given a certain amount of fluency, and a man
   might hope to become a celebrated Christian teacher. Even in those
   classes which were destitute of any real kind of rhetorical training
   the vice of pious gossip increased apace. Many Christians praised the
   clever preacher as they left the assembly without giving one moment's
   thought to the fact that the practising of what was preached was more
   important than all else. The stupid idle chatter about faith and
   justification arose in consequence of the public reading of St Paul's
   letters. It was Catholic Christians and not Gnostics who made use of
   the saying as to saving faith in such a way as to undermine morality.
   But the worst feature of all was the contrast presented between this
   gossip about spiritual things and the miserable condition of the
   elementary moral life. Jealousy and wrangling, slander and party
   strife, were all endured without any feeling of the contradiction to
   the ethical ideal that was thereby involved. Such was the beginning of
   later Greek Christianity. After the First Epistle to the Corinthians,
   the Pastoral epistles and the Epistle of St James afford us some
   glimpses into this the earliest period of its history.

   Such was the Christian life of the sub-apostolic age in many quarters.
   Of course there is a bright side as well as a dark to the picture. If
   it were not so, the attraction which Christianity continued to exercise
   would not be intelligible. The severe criticism to which the
   above-mentioned faults are subjected in the Christian writings should
   itself be regarded as a formidable sign. For it is entirely the
   Christians themselves to whom we are indebted for our knowledge of the
   dark side of the life of the congregations, and together with this
   knowledge we have in each case the vigorous reaction of the Christian
   conscience presented to us.

   What we have to do is to endeavour to realize the Christian ideal of
   life itself, as it was maintained by the teachers of the Church in so
   pleasing a contrast to all these aberrations.

   On the whole it is the ideal of the first great age, only it has been
   enriched--and that not to its advantage--by a dogmatic and
   ecclesiastical outwork. This outwork is in a great measure--not
   wholly--the result of the Gnostic controversy. Perhaps the development
   of the Church would itself have produced it, The confession of the
   orthodox faith is claimed as the essence of Christianity and the
   presupposition for every recognition of Christian life. Christians
   were, it is true, the faithful, even in the time of St Paul and
   earlier, but the formulas of the faith were as yet very simple. The
   expansion of the Christological confession shows us how an even greater
   importance was attached to the scope and contents of the faith, how
   faith came to be a formulated knowledge, a primitive kind of gnosis.
   Then the strict conception of orthodoxy was evolved in the course of
   the Gnostic controversy; the creed came to be the distinctive mark
   amongst Christians. He that cannot repeat the orthodox creed is of the
   devil. Nor was it long before this new orthodoxy brought forth a whole
   system of uncharitableness, censoriousness, and slander, such as was
   scarcely capable of increase. Enmity to the unbelieving Christian comes
   to be the mark of the true Christian. That was the first defection from
   the Gospel.

   In the next place, a prime importance was attached to ecclesiasticism,
   to subordination to the bishop and his jurisdiction. Originally the
   Christian care for the common weal furthered the mutual rendering of
   the services of love amongst the brethren and made them give heed to
   the voice of the Spirit in the prophets. As the new episcopal
   constitution was developed in the course of the sub-apostolic age,
   obedience to the officials of the Church came to be more and more
   regarded as of the greatest consequence. The First Epistle of St
   Clement shows us how the claims of the Church would have come to be
   urged above all else even without the Gnostic struggle. The author,
   writing on behalf of the Roman Church, endeavoured to restore
   ecclesiastical peace at Corinth, when the younger had stirred up strife
   against the older. To effect his purpose, he writes as though
   Christianity and ecclesiastical order were identical. Every defection
   from this order, every disturbance of ecclesiastical unity, is to be
   taxed as a heinous sin, for ecclesiastical order is of divine origin.
   Subordination to the presbyters comes to be an essential characteristic
   of Christianity. In a long series of homilies which are apparently but
   loosely connected with the principal subject of the letter, the value
   and the blessing of the discipline of the Church are held up to the
   Corinthians, and proved by the authority of the Old Testament, by their
   harmony with the order of Nature. Among the subjects of these homilies
   are jealousy, the cause of the disturbances at Corinth; repentance,
   i.e., return to ecclesiastical discipline; obedience, i.e., subjection
   to the divine order (that of the Church); humility, the opposite of the
   exalting oneself above ecclesiastical discipline; peace, i.e., the
   harmony which is gradually to prevail, as in God's creation, so also in
   the Church; and, generally speaking, discipline. We here learn how
   these oldest Christians interpreted the Pauline panegyric of love. For
   them it is the panegyric of ecclesiastical unity. It is of course quite
   true to say that it was only the actual condition of things at Corinth
   which caused the personal duties of Christians to be so entirely
   subordinated in this letter to their ecclesiastical obligations. There
   is no doubt, however, that we here see the first steps on the road
   towards Catholicism. The struggle with the Gnostics accelerated this
   development of ecclesiasticism, and almost threw it into confusion. The
   Christian's first duty is now above all to be the faithful subject of
   the bishop, and to undertake nothing without him. Whoever does anything
   without the bishop serves the devil, so it is said henceforth. It is
   especially in Ignatius that we find that the hierarchy has obtained a
   firm footing in the Christian life. We have gone back again to where
   Jesus began. That was the second great defection from the Gospel.

   Both orthodoxy and ecclesiasticism are henceforth essential elements in
   the Christian ideal. No one refusing to give ear to their claims can be
   said to be in possession of the ideal. But at the same time it would
   not be fair to be blind to the great fidelity shown throughout this age
   to the old Christianity. One result of the struggle against the
   Gnostics was to sharpen the insight of the teachers into the practical
   and ethical characteristics of the Gospel. And besides, men like the
   author of the Epistle to St James show us that even without this
   struggle, the chief thing needful was not forgotten by earnest minds.

   Most of the representatives of the Catholicism that is in process of
   development are unanimous in their enthusiastic proclamation:
   Christianity is practical piety, a new ethical life, a walking in
   righteousness, a doing of good works--nothing extraordinary, but just
   those of the every-day life--and love to the brethren. Speculations,
   mysticism, idle dreams and pious prattle--none of these nor yet
   asceticism is Christianity: they are something entirely foreign to it.
   This excellent principle is set forth with all conceivable clearness by
   the teachers of the Church.

   The Pastoral letters, the writings of St John and the Epistle of St
   James, afford us the completest proof of this practical understanding
   of the Gospel.

   The author of the Pastoral letters manifests an instinctive hatred for
   every kind of speculation and controversy. He can clearly see that
   these things have nothing whatever to do with Christianity. What he
   wants is piety, i.e., a purely ethical realization of religion. He
   describes its utility in perfectly simple language. God would not have
   controversy, but good works, for these alone are profitable to men.
   Piety, personal religion, is a great source of gain--a somewhat
   commonplace remark, but it saves religion from moral corruption. Where
   there are no fruits, corruption has doubtless set in. Our author
   combats ascetic tendencies such as celibacy, abstention from food and
   wine, bodily exercise which profiteth little, no less vigorously than
   the craving for discussion. Thereby, too, he saves simple morality and
   the faith in Providence, which are incompatible with asceticism. He
   goes to such lengths in his polemic against asceticism that he would
   have bishops married, and forbids Timothy to drink only water. He shows
   his sound and sober anti-asceticism, too, in his treatment of the
   widows. He limits the vita religiosa as much as possible, and leads
   women back to the tasks of every-day life--above all, to the education
   of children. Young widows are to marry again, otherwise they will fall
   prey to Satan in the end. No superior morality is demanded of the
   bishop, except that he is only permitted to marry once. He is to be a
   thorough Christian, and a pattern of Christian life--that is enough.
   Hence weight is attached to his Christian marriage and household, to
   his honesty, modesty, freedom from love of gold, sobriety and
   kindliness. Thus the clergy are to be reformed on the foundation of the
   simple Gospel. The Pastoral epistles by no means represent a low level
   of Christianity, a Christianity of just an average nature. On the
   contrary, the aversion shown for speculation and asceticism--the
   monkish ideal--is the presupposition of the genuine conception of
   Christian life. It must be admitted that these letters breathe a
   somewhat Philistine sobriety: there is an absence of any very great
   warmth or fervour of language. But in combating a number of extravagant
   fanatics and sophists, this sobriety was the salvation of Christianity.
   The author was a thoroughly sound Christian who was entitled--none more
   so--to the claim that he possessed the sound doctrine.

   The author of the Johannine writings took good care that no reader of
   his Gospel should be in any doubt as to the practical character of
   Christianity. For him, as for the author of the Pastoral epistles,
   Christianity is faith and love. Faith comes first. The aim of the first
   twelve chapters is to recommend it to us, and to defend it from attacks
   from without. Then the last discourses of Jesus reveal the real essence
   of discipleship which presupposes faith as something purely practical.
   First comes the washing of the disciples feet as an example of
   ministering love, then the new commandment, the testament of the love
   of the brethren. But the parable of the vine and the branches in the
   fifteenth chapter, affords us the clearest insight of all into the
   character of Christian discipleship. The disciple's aim is to bring
   forth fruits, to realize religion in good works. This bringing forth of
   fruit is only possible through communion with Jesus, or, as John says,
   by abiding' in Jesus. There is a mystic ring about the expression, and
   it is even possible that John borrowed it from the Gnostics. But he
   himself immediately adapts the mystical expression to ethical
   requirements. Communion with Jesus consists in the faithful keeping of
   His words. Our only guarantee for its persistence is the keeping of His
   commandments, and the chiefest of these is love to the brethren, which
   is to go as far as the laying down of one's life for their sakes. So,
   too, there is no friendship with Jesus unless "ye do that which I
   command you." The sequence of thoughts is, it is true, illogical.
   Communion with Jesus is on the one hand said to be the condition for
   the bringing forth of fruits, and on the other, it is itself
   conditioned by the keeping of the commandments--in other words, by the
   fruits. Nevertheless, the aim of these exhortations is perfectly clear.
   Faith and a life in righteousness form one indivisible whole, and the
   righteous life is God's aim in uniting us with Jesus. Exactly the same
   current of thought runs through the first epistle, only the contrast
   with the Gnostic terms of expression causes them to be rather more
   accentuated. Nothing can be more magnificent than the opening words of
   his polemic against his adversaries, the purely moral conception of the
   knowledge of God. If God is light, then our duty is plain: it is to
   walk in the light.

   There is no knowledge of God unless we do His commandments.

   There is no love of God unless we keep His words.

   There is no being in God unless we walk in Jesus' footsteps.

   There is no being in the light unless we show love to the brethren.

   A Christian is a child of God if he does righteousness and loves the
   brethren. That is the only criticism both before God and men. Love does
   not consist in the mystic flight of the soul to God; God is invisible:
   we cannot love Him, therefore, directly. All love of God must show
   itself forth as love of the brethren, and that not in words but in
   deeds, beginning with the ungrudging gift right up to the laying down
   of one's life. The ethical character of the Gospel cannot be expressed
   more magnificently than in the solemn adjuration: the world with its
   cravings is passing away, but those who do God's will live for ever. It
   is only the constant repetition of the claim for the orthodox
   confession as the presupposition of all morality that reminds us of the
   difference between these statements and the sayings of Jesus. No man is
   less of a mystic than this John, for whom the ethical alone is eternal.
   True, he often uses mystical words; so, e.g., in the celebrated passage
   of the entrance of the Father and the Son into the hearts of the
   disciples. The reason for that is that in his time such expressions
   were very frequent among Christians, echoes of the former doctrine of
   the indwelling of the Spirit. But whenever John adapts a mystical
   expression of this kind, he emphasizes the ethical demand, the keeping
   of the commandments, far more than the promised blessedness. The vision
   of God is reserved for the future. The road that leads to it passes
   through simple morality and love, not through speculation, and not
   through religious epicurism. Such is the motto of St John's practical
   Christianity.

   The authors of the Pastoral epistles and of the Johannine writings were
   led to emphasize the practical element in Christianity by their
   controversy with the Gnostic teachers who recommended speculations,
   mysticism and asceticism. The Epistle of St James has the same aim in
   view, though not occasioned in the same manner. At first sight it
   consists of a number of loosely arranged and loosely connected
   sentences, as though it were a congeries of Jewish and Christian
   proverbs. And yet there is an underlying unity. Throughout, the author
   strikes a clear and dominant note--the cry to be up and doing,
   Christianity is something practical--the fight against everything that
   is corrupt, torpid, morbid in the congregations. The ideal
   Christian--so he appears to the author's mind--is the active, energetic
   man who toileth terribly. This ideal he does not preach systematically,
   but sets it forth in a number of antitheses to the defects of his day.
   No mere hearing, but doing of the word. No service of God which
   consists solely in ceremonial observances, but a practically divine
   service, deeds of mercy to widows and orphans, and the keeping oneself
   pure from the contamination of the world. No boasting of faith and
   justification; works belong to faith or else it is dead. No pious
   prattle about spiritual things, but silence and action. No pluming
   oneself on the theoretical possession of wisdom. Wisdom is to be
   recognized by a man's walk, by the fruits of chastity, peaceableness,
   and goodness. The author of this epistle was certainly no spiritually
   profound teacher, far indeed from being a match for St Paul, whose
   misunderstood formulas he combats. But what a splendid, sound Christian
   he is, after the mind of Jesus, for all that! A truly comforting
   appearance in the sub-apostolic age, completely untouched by the
   Hellenic and Gnostic spirit; no intellectual giant, but a hero in moral
   excellence.

   Would that they had written in their own names, these simple saviours
   of Christianity in its darkest hour! They understood the Gospel of
   Jesus better than all later Catholic and Protestant dogmatists. The
   pseudo-James is, besides this, entirely untouched by orthodoxy and
   ecclesiasticism. Both the other authors, however, afford a good proof
   that the heart of practical Christianity remained untouched by those
   outworks of dogmatism and ecclesiasticism. Orthodoxy and
   ecclesiasticism were the necessary armour for the substance of the
   Gospel of Jesus. It needed a protection such as this, capable of
   resisting the world both within and without. They were not the main
   thing--not even for those who fought for them. The main thing even now
   was the fruit of good living, the doing of God's will, as John says, in
   Jesus' words. The authors of the Epistle to the Hebrews, of the First
   Epistle of St Peter, of the First and Second of Clement, Ignatius,
   Polycarp, Justin, all thought and wrote in the same strain. In this
   main point they are all evangelical Christians.

   The only question now is, What transformation did the practical ideal
   itself undergo, what aspects were bound to acquire prominence in
   consequence of the altered historical position? The one thing needful
   is still, at bottom, that which it was in the Gospel of Jesus--to be in
   the right relation to the three great realities, to one's own soul, to
   one's brother, and to God. Only--as we already have seen was the case
   in St Paul--certain special claims have to be emphasized in consequence
   of the formation of communities and the contrast to the heathen
   surroundings; and besides this, an even greater attention has
   necessarily to be paid to the outer forms of the life of the community.

   Sanctification is the watchword for the individual in relation to
   himself. As before, the word signifies renunciation of the sinful world
   and consecration of the entire personal life to God. Included in this
   is naturally a decided abjuration of all elementary sins, such as
   drunkenness, thieving and lying, all forms of idolatry, of magic and
   the like. But the resolve to live a life of purity excels all other
   demands. It often appears to be absolutely the most important element
   in the conversion to Christianity. Justin tells us of a Roman woman who
   had lived a life of vice. The very first thing that she did after her
   conversion by a teacher named Ptolemaus was to renounce her unchaste
   life. The case is a typical one. The dividing line between the
   Christian and the non-Christian is above all else a difference of
   attitude and of judgment with regard to the laxity and the filth of the
   sexual life amongst the heathen. The reaction against the prevailing
   immorality soon passed over into asceticism. The first commencements of
   the monkish ideal date from the age with which we are now concerned. In
   like manner more value was attached in many instances to external
   purity than to the purity of the heart. The strict ecclesiastical
   discipline which inexorably excluded fornicators and adulterers, but
   naturally could not control impure thoughts, was bound to play directly
   into the hands of hypocrisy in many cases. Nevertheless the strictness
   with which the early Christians pressed this claim above all others was
   fully justified. All other Christian virtues, love to the brethren,
   trust in God, patience, peaceableness, can neither flourish, or are
   rightly regarded as tainted with hypocrisy where the individual has not
   yet gained control over his natural impulses. And again, how could the
   Christians have possibly engaged in their struggle against the whole
   world without including in their ideal the most absolute demand for
   chastity? The greatness of this, the earliest age, just consists in the
   refusal on the part of the Christians to make any compromises--without
   abatement of one jot or tittle they press their lofty ideal upon a
   world which, it must be admitted, is not yet equal to such an exalted
   standard. In spite of much backsliding on the part of individuals, the
   Christian congregations could honestly claim to be the homes of a pure
   and healthy life. And that meant a great deal.

   Naturally, then, the chiefest concern of the Christian teachers in
   laying down their prescriptions for marriages, Christian as well as
   mixed, was to see the ideal of purity and fidelity realized in them.
   Hence their campaign against luxury and the love of dress. The custom
   of concluding the marriage ceremony before the bishop dates from the
   time of Ignatius, and proved salutary and beneficial in encouraging
   publicity and preventing precipitancy. The author of the First Epistle
   of St Peter endeavours to elevate the position of women and to ennoble
   marriage by his sensible admonitions addressed to Christian husbands.
   At the same time he warns the wives of heathen husbands against a
   mistaken spirit of proselytising, and urges them to gain influence by
   their conduct without a word being said. The Pastoral epistles lay
   great emphasis on good order in the household and an honest education,
   and would have the women be good housewives. Nearly all the teachers of
   the sub-apostolic age recognize it as their duty to apply the
   principles of the gospel to the married state, without forgetting
   unmarried women and widows--the simplest and most natural of
   requirements, one would think. But we must remember that their task was
   to create a firmly-established Christian tradition in quarters where
   the most primitive conceptions of what was right and decent were often
   to seek. All the blessings of pure and healthy ideas and habits which
   it is still in our power to enjoy to-day are derived from this
   Christian tradition.

   The restriction of brotherly love to the members of the congregation
   dates from the establishment of the congregations as organized bodies.
   It was necessary, and not in itself injurious. Reminiscences of Jesus'
   commandment of love without limits, and especially of love to one's
   enemies, are not wanting. The First Epistle of St Peter, Ignatius and
   Polycarp, dating from the period of persecution, admonish us to this
   love in splendid words which might just as well have stood in the
   gospel. Unfortunately the Gnostic controversy introduced a hostile and
   censorious spirit into the Church itself, and so brotherly love was
   restricted to orthodox believers. In the Johannine writings this
   restriction meets us in an altogether un-Christian form. "Not for the
   world do I pray," says Jesus in the high-priestly prayer. And how poor
   a thing after all is the new commandment of love to each other--i.e.,
   of Christians to Christians--compared with the absolute boundless love
   enjoined in the Sermon on the Mount. As the Gospel of St John limits
   the frontiers of love in the direction of the world with a downright
   narrow-mindedness, so do the epistles against the heretics within the
   Church. Even the friendly greeting--the outward token of humanity--is
   to be refused to the man who holds not the doctrine "Jesus Christ come
   in the flesh." The duty of intercessory prayer is not to extend as far
   as those who have committed deadly sin. None of these propositions
   breathe the spirit of the gospel, for the simple Christian conscience
   cannot reconcile itself to them. But when once we have come within St
   John's narrow circle there is something great, it must be admitted, in
   the intensity of his love. From that narrow heart of his nothing but
   warmth and fervour shines forth. In fact, it may be said generally that
   love of the brethren, manifesting itself especially in works of charity
   and mercy, is reckoned as the essential element of religion in all the
   writings of our period. Sanctification and brotherly love are often
   mentioned together as making up the sum and substance of all the claims
   of the religious life. In controversy with the Gnostics, love is
   claimed as the characteristic of orthodox Christianity, for the Gnostic
   theories sanctioned religious egoism. And a further indication of the
   immense esteem in which love was held may be found in the fact that the
   saying "Love covers a multitude of sins" directly or indirectly colours
   the writings of the sub-apostolic age, and almost rivals in importance
   the statement as to the faith that forgives all sins. Whoever has
   distinguished himself by works of mercy may hope to find grace with God
   in the day of judgment. However much we may be forced to admit that
   this conception paved the way even now for the later Catholic doctrines
   of salvation by works and human merit, there is yet much that gladdens
   one in it, for it exalts love, the truly divine element in us, above
   all else. The striking conclusion of the eschatological discourse of
   Jesus in St Matthew, wherein everlasting blessedness is promised all
   those who have given either food or drink, lodging or raiment, to one
   of the least of His brethren, or visited them in sickness or
   imprisonment, while those who did not do so are condemned, is surely
   more in accordance with the mind of the Master than all the statements
   as to faith and unbelief which the evangelist John puts into His mouth.

   The principal direction in which this brotherly love was manifested in
   the sub-apostolic age may be gathered from the concrete instances
   mentioned by St Matthew in the verses just quoted. Hospitality, the
   lodging and caring for missionaries and the many other brethren on
   their journeys, usually comes first. Here, too, is the place to notice
   the custom of the washing of the feet which the Pastoral letters and St
   John presuppose as firmly established. If we next consider the single
   congregation in itself, we have the duties of the care for the poor,
   the support of widows and orphans with food, drink, and clothing, the
   visiting and caring for the sick. Later on there was a church fund for
   widows who were under the bishop's special care, though the Epistle of
   St James and Hermas still enjoin upon all Christians the duty of
   visiting the fatherless and widows in their affliction. In certain
   localities we find the custom of the ransoming of Christian slaves from
   their masters prevalent. A new duty was added to these in the age of
   persecution, viz., the visiting of imprisoned Christians, the earliest
   description of which is given us by the satirist Lucian. All these
   services of love were rendered personally in the oldest time, not by
   the bishop alone, but by every member of the congregation. Rich and
   fashionable people were especially expected to perform such duties and
   thereby prove the sincerity of their Christianity. At a very early
   date, however, personal service came to be compounded for by
   almsgiving, whereby the principal importance was attached to the amount
   given. The Lucan writings, Hermas, the Didache and the Second Epistle
   of St Clement, introduced this form of piety from Judaism into the
   Christian Church, and enhanced its reputation. One can already hear the
   ominous watchwords: "Almsgiving alleviates the burden of sins or
   releases a man from sin and from death." Luke and Hermas uphold the
   theory that the rich man can acquire heaven by his charities to poor
   Christians. Hermas maintains that he can even gain blessing on earth
   thereby. According to the second parable of Hermas, it is only the poor
   Christian who has religion in the strict sense of the word, and that as
   a poor man. His prayers alone find access to God, and not those of the
   rich man. If the rich man would have any share in religion he must
   obtain the poor man's mediation by his charities. That was of course
   the caricature of the evangelical ideal of love. Nor can we find much
   consolation in the thought that this second parable was perhaps written
   by a Jew and was taken over unchanged by Hermas. It is bad enough that
   a Christian could appropriate such a writing. But most Christian
   teachers knew that the bestowing of money or of goods formed but a
   little fraction of that all-embracing requirement. Be he rich or poor,
   much more is expected of the individual member by the Church--mutual
   forbearance and forgiveness, sympathy and comfort, while each gives way
   to the other, and thinks only of his neighbour's well-being with
   patience and meekness. How far this ideal of love was realized in the
   churches we cannot tell. But the maintenance of the old ideal was a
   blessing in itself. Many proselytes were attracted by the rich
   manifoldness of the Christian love of the brethren more than by
   anything else. And on the contrary, nothing injured a congregation so
   much as when rich individuals abstained from works of love. The
   strength and the beauty of Christian love were most strikingly
   confirmed in the days of distress and persecution. It was then that the
   members of a congregation felt that the whole of Christendom prayed and
   suffered with them; money was gathered, letters were exchanged, good
   counsel and comfort freely given.

   A special signification is now also attached to the summons to
   Christians to show trust in God: it is the duty to approve their
   constancy and their valour in suffering, and if need be in death. No
   other admonition is of greater importance in relation to God. The love
   of the brethren provides against all necessities both within and
   without. But when face to face with the foe, the individual must depend
   upon God's comfort and promises. The Apocalypse and then the First
   Epistle of St Peter are the earliest of a long series of writings
   intended to comfort and to exhort martyrs. All later writers continue
   in the same strain. The example of Jesus, the first martyr, now
   exercised a mighty influence upon the hard-pressed Church. The
   Apocalypse, the First Epistles of St Peter and St John, hold Him up to
   the eye of the Christians as their leader in suffering and in death.
   "Be of good cheer: I have overcome the world." As the Master overcame,
   so, too, the disciple may overcome. The call to show a heroic trust in
   God was first of all addressed to the leaders. It is for them that John
   draws the picture of the true shepherd, who lays down his life for his
   sheep, and of the cowardly hireling who abandons them and flies away at
   the approach of the wolf. There is no lack of instances of apostasy and
   desertion from the very first. The separation from all one's relations,
   the sufferings of imprisonment and of torture, all the dread
   antecedents of martrydom, caused many a brave Christian to waver for a
   moment. But all hesitation vanished as he looked forward and beheld the
   victor's crown. Make whatever abstractions you like, there is something
   inexpressibly great in these Christians, none of whom could tell
   whether he would not have to go forth to martyrdom on the morrow.

   The expectation of the Parousia was of the greatest importance for the
   Christian life. It definitely turned the lives of all serious-minded
   people in the direction of eternity. They applied the words "the world
   passeth away and the lust thereof" to all that ancient civilization had
   to offer. Hence there is scarcely any appreciation whatever of culture
   in early Christian ethics. It is true the State is judged least
   severely in spite of the persecutions, because it has both the power
   and the function of guaranteeing order and peace. And of learning, too,
   the Christians just took as much as served for edification and defence.
   Everything else--art, social intercourse, amusement--belongs, in the
   judgment of most men, to Satan's kingdom, for it is filled with a
   hundred temptations to sin. Very rarely indeed do we come across any
   statement that is free from this narrow restrictedness of view, and
   that shows us how the Christian is to go through life as master of this
   world and superior to it. John gives the motto: "Love not the world:
   all that is in the world is not of the Father." There was something
   narrow and sectarian that obtained a firm footing in Christian ethics
   from the very first. That was the reverse of its strength. The
   Christians came into the world as rebels against the prevailing
   religions and customs. They waged war against its faith and fashions,
   against long-standing habits and tolerance of evil. The world was their
   enemy; how could they have loved it? The time had not yet come for a
   positive appreciation of the benefits of culture and civilization. It
   was martyrs that were now needed, men who valued death for their faith
   more highly than all that the world had to offer.

   It was a great achievement--this clear recognition of the Gospel's
   claims which maintained itself till the middle of the second century. A
   Christian--there is no doubt about this--is one who is master of
   himself, who loves the brethren, and trusts God even unto death. This
   clear vision is about to be dimmed, it is true: Catholic aberrations,
   the extreme value attached to alms, fasting, celibacy, are near at
   hand, but as yet they have left the main points untouched. The preacher
   who composed the so-called Second Epistle of St Clement at a fairly
   early date had indeed no bad understanding of the Gospel of Jesus.
   Apologists such as Aristides and Justin hold up the moral greatness of
   Christianity to the heathen. But these were in themselves mere words,
   theories, and the real condition of many congregations by no means
   corresponded to the ideal. They were tainted by the canker of
   worldliness. It is a question even now whether the Churches can in the
   long run fulfil their function, which is to be the means of redemption.
   But this is not the really essential matter. The Christianity which
   Jesus brought into the world is something personal. In the strict
   sense, therefore, it can never be realized save in individuals. All
   outward forms of association entangle it with the world and produce a
   confusion between the ideal and the real. Christians are at all times
   single individuals. Such individuals existed in the sub-apostolic age;
   probably they existed in greater numbers then than later. It was only
   through these individuals that the Christianity of that age as a whole
   was impregnated with the Christian character.

CHAPTER XV.

  THE REDEMPTION.

   CHRISTIANITY appeared in the world as the religion of redemption.
   Promising, as it does, everlasting bliss to mankind, and setting forth
   as the road thereto the doing of God's will, its aim is to inspire men
   even now with courage, strength and joy for the new life, through the
   gladness of communion with God. Jesus Himself was more than a prophet
   and teacher of God's will. He came to men as their Redeemer, to bring
   God near to them and lift them up to be children of God.

   After His death, His redemptive power continued to work in the
   fellowship of His disciples, as the Spirit of Christ, to use St Paul's
   expression. The story of His life, and, still more, the new life of His
   disciples, kindled at His flame, now took the place of His Person.
   Christianity ever clung fast to this its claim. It did not merely hold
   up the goal to men and show the way to blessedness. It did, as a matter
   of fact, set their feet on the right road and led them to their
   journey's end by imparting the power of God which lives in Jesus and
   His disciples. Everything, therefore, converges on the message of the
   love or grace of God.

   What do we learn of this redemption in the sub-apostolic age? We must
   draw a sharp distinction between the actual experiences and the
   postulates. The latter we shall do well to regard with the greatest
   distrust. Christian writings are filled from one end to the other with
   statements as to the value of the death of Jesus and of baptism, of the
   new birth and reception of the Spirit. But they are partly apologetic,
   and partly devotional watchwords and formulas handed on from one man to
   another, a part of the language of Christianity, without any objective
   reality necessarily corresponding to them. The Epistle of Barnabas may
   serve us as a deterrent example: "We enter the water full of sin and of
   filth; we come forth with fruit in our hearts, for we have our hope set
   on Jesus in the Spirit. Before this our heart was a dwelling place of
   demons; when we received forgiveness and hoped in His name, then we
   were created anew from the beginning." Nothing could be better
   expressed. If it were only true! The authors of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, the First of St Peter, the First of Clement, and Justin
   ascribe forgiveness and cleansing power to the blood of Jesus, and
   thereby prove that reliance was placed on this. Here we have merely
   theories, however, and theories alone are never able to guarantee a new
   life. Listen to the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews: "If the blood
   of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling them that have
   been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh: how much more
   shall the blood of Christ cleanse your conscience from dead works to
   serve the living God?" The learned author is, of course, perfectly
   right in refusing to admit that the blood of the sacrificial victims
   has any efficacy upon the conscience: but is the blood of Christ, then,
   any more suited to cleanse the conscience? How can the debt of
   personal, moral wrongdoing be wiped out by another's blood? Much
   superstition was attached from the earliest times to the blood of
   Christ and to baptism. The effects of both were conceived of as
   magical, even where no change in the moral nature followed. A necessary
   consequence of this theology of the blood of Christ and of the
   sacraments was that men contented themselves with the external
   objective facts and never asked themselves the question: Am I really a
   redeemed person in my life?

   We are on different ground altogether when Christians speak of their
   conversion. Here we come across positive facts. The majority of every
   congregation was as yet formed of converts from heathen ism. Here
   conversion was an occurrence the day and hour of which were known to
   every man, for it divided the whole life into two clear divisions. For
   most men it marked the breach with an evil past, when the filth of
   bestial barbarity and childish superstition were laid aside. The
   Christian fellowship conferred great gifts upon them: a pure and moral
   faith in God, the Gospel ideal of life, and an unshaken hope which
   lifted them up above all need. In addition they received at their
   entrance the promise of the forgiveness of all past sins, a gift that
   brought the greatest blessedness to earnest seekers, of doubtful value,
   however, to such as were of baser alloy. The new converts were by the
   grace of God confirmed in their possession of all these realities. The
   sudden transition to their new condition produced psychical convulsions
   in many, mysterious ecstatic phenomena. Yet such cases were
   exceptional. The preponderant feeling which characterized the reception
   of these new gifts was something half rational, half superstitious. The
   immense impression made by conversion, the sharp antithesis between
   then and now, finds frequent expression in early Christian literature.
   If the expression is not all too stereotyped, we may be sure that there
   is some underlying experience. Yet in very early times such experiences
   came to be clothed in a traditional liturgical language which has to be
   accepted with caution.

   But now we come to the principal question: Does the rest of the
   Christian life correspond to the conversion? Does the Christian really
   lead a redeemed life from baptism onwards?

   All that we gather from the Pastoral epistles, the Epistle of St James,
   the "Shepherd" of Hermas, the sermon of Clement, leads us to answer the
   questions decidedly in the negative. Very many Christians indeed cannot
   be counted redeemed. The difference between the former and the present
   life was frequently imperceptible. Heathen laxity and licentiousness,
   superstition, uncertainty and fear, party spirit, care--all made their
   way over into the Christian congregations from their heathen
   surroundings. The state of things presupposed by the Epistle of St
   James and the personality of Hermas afford the plainest evidence. The
   readers of the Epistle, e.g., are on so low a plane that it is quite
   intelligible that the question has been asked whether they are
   Christians at all. The author inveighs against his rich readers with a
   "Woe unto you," as though they stood outside of the Church. And
   naturally, for they blaspheme the Christian name by their un-Christian
   conduct. Nor do the majority of the congregation appear to have been
   much better. "You crave for something and do not get it. You commit
   murder and try your utmost to secure the thing and yet you cannot do
   so. You quarrel and fight. You do not get what you want because you do
   not ask. When you ask you do not get it, because you ask for a wrong
   purpose--to spend what you get upon your pleasures." "Make your hands
   clean, you sinners, and your hearts pure, you vacillating men! Be
   afflicted, and mourn, and weep." Are these men still to be considered
   Christians? Yes or no, as you like it. Redeemed children of God they
   are not.

   With the exception of Ignatius, the Roman prophet Hermas is the only
   Christian whom we get to know personally from his writings. The
   declaration at his baptism that his sins were forgiven him had made a
   profound impression upon him. This forgiveness, however, only covered
   his pre-Christian past. After baptism--so he was taught--the Christian
   was to sin no more, but remain pure. This was a sheer impossibility for
   Hermas and his family. His household was disorderly. His children
   blasphemed God, betrayed their parents, and lived riotous lives. His
   wife sinned continuously with her tongue. But he himself is far from
   being an ideal character. At the very beginning of his book his
   conscience pricks him because of adulterous thoughts; his imagination
   is altogether corrupt and easily trespasses on forbidden ground. He
   behaves toward his children like a good-natured blockhead, and shuts
   his eyes to their failings. The third commandment contains a terrible
   confession as to his truthfulness: "Never in all my life have I spoken
   a single true word, but always and to all men have I spoken with
   cunning and made my lies pass as good coin among all; nor did any man
   ever contradict me, but they believed my words." Hence, too, throughout
   his life he knows that he is full of sin, and confessions of sin are
   never absent from his lips. His will-power is half broken. He has no
   backbone. Fear always has the upper hand in him. The picture which we
   gather from his writings as a whole gives one the impression of an
   unredeemed nature. Sin holds him fast in her chains. He cannot shake
   himself free. Hence his anxious question, "What must I do to be saved?
   How shall I make atonement to God for my misdeeds, if even sins of
   thought are recorded?"

   The picture is, of course, incomplete. We have not got the whole
   Hermas, any more than the prophet Ezra in his prayers and questionings
   is the whole Ezra. His personality is divided into a strong and a weak
   half. The former is represented by the angel, Hermas' better self.
   True, the woman who appears to him in the first vision merely
   represents his evil conscience, which fills him with misery. But
   otherwise the angel is sharply distinguished from him, as the soul of
   all that is good and confident and glad and strong. He speaks but to
   utter vigorous commands. "Be of good cheer, doubt not; be strong,
   believe; cast thy care upon the Lord." The fourth vision is especially
   instructive, where Hermas overcomes the terrors of the last vision by
   recollection of the voice which he heard, "Doubt not, Hermas."
   Thereupon Hermas puts on the armour of faith, thinks of the great
   things which the angel has taught him, and plucks up courage. His
   conversation with the angel at the close of the twelfth commandment is
   likewise full of comfort. When he asks in doubt whether God's
   commandments can ever be fulfilled, the angel answers: "If you resolve
   that they shall be fulfilled, they can be easily: they will not be
   hard." Hence in the end the picture emerges of a Christian who in spite
   of all weakness and corruption has good and glad moments in his life
   whence he draws strength to persevere bravely on his journey.

   In addition to this there is the great consolation which Hermas is able
   to announce to himself and all Christians: God's great mercy affords
   all Christians yet one other grace, that of repentance. If they avail
   themselves of this at once while it is still to-day, their earlier
   Christian sinful life shall be wiped away. Hermas describes the
   impression which this message made upon him: "When I heard thee
   announce this to me in these very terms, I was awakened unto life." So
   in the third vision: "Power came upon you and ye became strong in the
   faith, and when the Lord beheld your strength He rejoiced." "It is as
   though a man should receive an inheritance a short while before his
   death that raises him up to renewed strength." Such was the effect of
   forgiveness upon Christians. It was, of course, a law of grace, which
   had for its reverse all manner of terrors. Woe to the Christian that
   sins again! Yet they took it to their hearts and were glad, for once
   more they were able to hope.

   There is no lack, therefore, of bright touches to relieve the
   prevailing gloom of the picture which Hermas leaves us. But he had no
   experience of the redemption which Jesus wanted to bring. Just as Jesus
   Himself is unknown to him, so likewise are the God of Jesus and the
   Gospel. God is not his heavenly Father! nor is He the God of love! He
   has no certainty of salvation, no comfort strong enough to overcome all
   the anguish of sin, no personal power for the good. Man remains the
   creature of his moods and feelings; there is none higher than himself
   that can set him free. After all, this is nothing but the religion of
   fear and hope, which prevailed before Jesus and which Jesus had
   overcome. Not a word is said of our being the children of God. St
   Paul's criticism of Judaism applies to this form of Christianity as
   well: "A spirit of bondage unto fear." As is the leader, so are the
   led. Hermas' description of his flock shows us throughout a lukewarm
   average Christianity. We hear not a word of redeemed men and women. The
   majority of Christians lacked the power to live the new life: they
   could get no further than good resolutions.

   As often as Hermas divides his Christians into classes and passes them
   in review, the number of the bad classes is sure to exceed that of the
   good. This, however, is partly due to the fact that the vices of
   Christians are always more striking than their virtues, and afford
   greater occasion for talk. In all the churches there lived a great
   company of men and women who had become new creatures through Jesus and
   His disciples, and had passed from death unto life. Theirs was a hidden
   life unknown to history--but the life was lived. The redemptive power
   of Christianity is brought before us so impressively in quite a number
   of Christian writings, that we feel that we have here the record of a
   real experience. The most striking of all these is the First Epistle of
   St John, full of the gladdest and yet soberest consciousness of an
   abiding redemption. Here we have a life that is lived above the world
   in love and the joy of God, free from all care and anxiety. The writer
   can find no words to express his praise and glad rejoicing. How
   boundless are the Christian's possessions: the knowledge of God, the
   forgiveness of sins, the victory over the devil, the confidence of
   prayer, courage on the day of judgment, the certainty of being a child
   of God and an heir of eternal life, perfect joy. "Behold what love the
   Father hath shown us, that we are called God's children, and such we
   are." He that has experienced all this in his own person may well
   attain in the bold flights of his faith to the statement that he is
   born of God, and in possession even now of eternal life. That is a
   judgment of faith, no empirical knowledge, and yet a judgment of faith
   which is based upon facts which are matters of experience--the keeping
   of the commandments, the love of the brethren. Hence the triumphant
   final judgment of this letter: "We know that we are of God, and the
   whole world lieth in the evil one." That we are of God is also
   confirmed to us by the Spirit with a sovereign self-consciousness. The
   Christian bears the witness within himself as Paul writes: "The spirit
   beareth witness to our spirit that we are the children of God." But
   just as St Paul ever took refuge from this inner testimony in the outer
   objective fact, the proof of God's love in the death of Jesus, in order
   to be secure from all the varying moods of his soul, so St John, too,
   places the water and the blood--i.e., the manifestation of God's love
   in the gift of His own Son--by the side of the Spirit's testimony. It
   is only because God's love has become so clear to him in Jesus--beyond
   all power of expression--that he can live his glad life, resting on the
   forgiveness of sins. It is of course a comfort for him, too, to feel
   sure that, in case he falls away and his conscience accuses him, the
   all-knowing God is greater than our accusing heart, and beholds the
   soul of goodness in sinful man. And yet how poor a consolation this
   would be in itself. Does not the thought of God's all-seeing eye call
   forth fear and terror within the breast of ordinary men? But for John
   the fact that God can read his inmost being is a comfort, because
   through Jesus he knows God as love, and is sure of pardon through faith
   in this love. We need but to compare John with Hermas if we would
   realize the difference that it makes for a Christian whether Jesus is
   ever before his soul or not. Though they are nearly contemporaries, the
   divergence between the two is immense. Hermas--a man who never gets
   beyond a state of alternate fear and hope, without trust in God and His
   love, his horizon limited by sin and the avoidance of sin. John, the
   sober Christian, who by no means considers himself to be sinless, but
   has nevertheless attained to the unshaken conviction, through
   experience of God's love, that he is a child of God in spite of all
   sin, and in this conviction goes boldly and gladly forward to obtain
   the promises, full of love and confidence. It is just the complete
   contrast between one that is redeemed and one as yet unredeemed.

   Notes such as John strikes, so full of the purest joy, are, it is true,
   not all too common. On the whole, it was the persecutions that were
   fitted to awaken the new life in the Christians. The authors of the
   First Epistle of St Peter and Ignatius are instances of this. In view
   of the sore tribulation the contrast with the world is accentuated, the
   devil stands bodily before man's soul. He has no other choice: either
   he must conquer or worship Satan. Temptations and cares which formerly
   hindered and oppressed the Christian are now easily overcome, since it
   is a question of life or death. The tares are separated from the wheat.
   Every Christian who clings firmly to the confession accomplishes the
   decisive act, bids farewell to the whole world in view of the promises.
   That awakens a hitherto unknown enthusiasm in the soul, a feeling of
   freedom from all former burdens, joy, longing, abandonment of all to
   God. Now the Christian praises God for that: he has a living hope which
   looks beyond death to the inheritance in heaven. He is glad with an
   unspeakable, a transfigured joy. Not till now does he enter into
   complete fellowship with Christ, now that he suffers with Him, looking
   forward to the rapturous joy of the revelation of His glory. In view of
   death he calls Christ his true life, his hope, his joy. To come to
   Christ is his only aim. "How could we live without Him?" Wherever this
   martyr joyfulness speaks to us it presupposes redeemed men, for joy is
   the best token--everywhere--of the new and blessed life.

   But redemption is also to be found wherever the moral task is clearly
   realized and the courage attained to fulfil it. In spite of their
   boundless hope, the Christians of our age were not, like Paul, of an
   emotional nature, but rather sober-minded, almost prosaic. Stormy,
   ecstatic outbursts do, it is true, flash forth now and then, but they
   are always felt to be exceptions, and it is just the teachers who have
   left us writings to whom they are comparatively unknown. Take them one
   after another, the authors of the Epistle to the Hebrews, of the
   Catholic and Pastoral epistles, the Apostolic Fathers. With the
   exception of Hermas, the apocalyptic visionary, only one of them boasts
   of personal revelations, voices of the Spirit--Ignatius; but the only
   specimen which he gives us of these is of so episcopal and theological
   a character that the good man would have spoken in exactly the same
   manner even had he been uninspired. All the others, not excepting John,
   are noble-minded moralists filled with a sure hope and animated by
   great moral earnestness, and just as such they are the saviours of
   Christianity; but there is no trace of the ecstatic enthusiast about
   them. Nor are the modern experiences of grace any less strange to these
   men than the manifestations of the spirit of ancient times. Not one of
   them boasts of the rapid alternations of feeling, from a miserable
   sinner to a pardoned child of God, which he experiences as a Christian
   in hours of blessed joy. Most of them rather, as a rule, look back upon
   pardon as a definite single event in the past, and expend all their
   power in the present, no longer to stand in need of it. Certainly one
   element in the greatness of this age is that Christians do not make
   much ado about their pious feelings and special experiences. Some of
   their teachers would in that case have without doubt themselves
   inveighed against the practice as mischievous, and likely to be
   attended by religious self-deception. So the author of the Epistle of
   St James. One of the immediate consequences of this great sobriety is
   that the joy of present redemption finds no expression in many cases.
   That is not to be regretted, however, nor is it a sign of decay. The
   first disciples of Jesus presented all that they had received from Him
   within the limits of the promises and the claim; it was only in their
   enthusiastic description of Jesus Himself that the gratitude of
   redeemed men finds expression. But the authors of these letters, living
   in a later age, had not to speak about Jesus but to point out the tasks
   of the present to the Churches. Their simplest, their most natural
   course, was therefore to say: As Christians, the greatest of all
   conceivable promises await us in the future, but their fulfilment is
   attached to one condition, that we should do God's will now in the
   present. That alone answered their purpose. And then by encouraging
   hope themselves and kindling moral zeal by their appeals, by calling
   attention to weak spots in the armour and giving good counsel, they
   furthered the true work of redemption without much eloquent palaver.
   Nor is it greatly to be regretted that they appealed to the will of
   their hearers instead of to God's grace and strength. For Jesus Himself
   had followed exactly the same course. What else are His words than
   imperatives addressed to a man's power of self-determination? On no
   single occasion does He make any mention of grace besides. The later
   teachers were therefore likewise fully justified in not diluting their
   energetic moral appeals by the message of grace. All these moralists
   are really good disciples of Jesus, and take part in the work of the
   real--not the theological redemption. For he that holds fast the
   Christian hope and walks in the path of love and obedience, with his
   eyes firmly fixed on the great goal, has entered into the new life,
   whether he talks piously about it or not.

   It was in another direction altogether that the sub-apostolic
   Christians went astray. Their real mistake was that they laboured under
   a misconception as to the sources of the new life. They gave up the
   reality and attached themselves to the shadow. Christian redemption is
   after all something exclusively personal, something effected by means
   of persons. It began when Jesus led His disciples to an unshaken hope,
   moral power, the comfort of God's love, victory over the world--even
   over death--by His words and the impression that He made upon them. It
   continued to flow on from this source through the founding of the
   Church which was inspired by Jesus Spirit, in which, therefore, every
   new member came into touch with Jesus Himself. All Christian life in
   the future derives from the true disciples of Jesus, who hand on their
   impression of Jesus to the Church and present something of His divine
   life in their own persons. Here are the two bed-rocks of our
   salvation--Jesus and His living disciples; these are proof against
   every trial, they are the great and comforting realities, the mediators
   of God's love. Here, too, was the source of all real redemption in the
   sub-apostolic age; it matters not whether Christians realized the fact
   or not. But for those realities they substituted imaginary objects--the
   blood of Christ, the sacraments--and made the certainty of their new
   life depend on them. The ignorance of Jesus that prevailed in the
   earliest missionary epoch is chiefly to blame for this. St Paul limited
   his preaching so uniformly and persistently to the death and
   resurrection of the Son of God that no impression of the historic
   Christ could be obtained from it. At the same time he attached a
   theological signification to the signs of membership which caused them
   to appear to be more important than the membership itself. The theory
   of the blood of Christ and of the sacraments was ready to hand; it had
   grown up along with the growth of the Christian consciousness when the
   written Gospels began to be spread abroad in the great Church of the
   Gentiles, and Jesus Himself became better known to all Christians. And
   so in spite of the new impression of the person of Jesus they cling to
   the old theory, their inheritance from St Paul. The writings of St John
   afford a striking confirmation of this statement. The Synoptic Gospels
   formed the author's spiritual food. He was compelled by them himself to
   put down his impressions of the future conveyed by the Gospel in the
   shape of a Gospel, so that the person of Jesus--the person and not His
   death alone--should become endeared to and revered by the whole world.
   This same man plainly shows us in his letter that he practically
   continues to derive all his comfort from the old formulae of the blood
   and the sacrifice. If this applies to a giant like John, how much more
   to Christians of smaller stature. A second decisive reason may be
   added. Men want to have something external as a guarantee for their
   salvation, and hence they eagerly take hold of facts--of historical
   occurrences and material things. Blood, water, wine and bread, possess
   the great advantage of being tangible and visible: they bulk larger
   than the invisible impression made by persons. The low level of culture
   which characterized the first age favoured this superstitious tendency.
   The age was not yet ripe for the understanding of purely personal
   greatness and nobility. The Gospels themselves, with their myths and
   their apparatus of miracles, lead us to this conclusion. A lofty
   ethical education is needed to reach even the theoretical certainty
   that persons and not things are that which is truly real. Hence it is
   that Christians have set up as the guarantees of their salvation,
   instead of the person of Christ, His blood, i.e., its theological
   interpretation; and instead of the fellowship of Christian persons, the
   sacraments.

   Hereby our religion has suffered grievous loss. In consequence of this
   transposition, the ethical element has been removed to the
   circumference, and superstition has been enthroned in the centre. He
   that has experienced the personal impression of Jesus and His disciples
   has received more than blood and the sacraments can ever impart to the
   fancy: he has come into touch with the living God, and that alone can
   uplift us into the eternal. By contact with these realities, the
   substance, he experiences a joy and a gladness which he would like to
   impart to all those who are yet under the bondage of the shadow.

   CONCLUDING REMARKS.

   If the presence of great men was the chief characteristic of the first,
   the creative period, then the want of them marks the second. St Paul
   has no successor, no one who attains to his level. The itinerant
   preachers, the apostles and prophets, degenerate, and have to hand over
   the guidance of the congregations to the bishops and teachers. Amongst
   these there are many powerful characters who keep their aim steadily in
   view, but no man inspired to open up new paths and acknowledged to be
   leader by a divine call. The fact that the ecclesiastical authors write
   anonymously or pseudonymously proves to us more than all else that even
   the leading persons feel themselves fallen on degenerate days and are
   no longer conscious of being personally called by God.

   A great ecclesiastical organization now takes the place of the great
   men. The Church itself dates from the earliest period. St Paul was one
   of the founders. But it is only in our period that it quite comes to
   occupy its dominating position. The creative spirit, hitherto free and
   untrammelled, is now confined within ecclesiastical forms and
   institutions which acquire their great power for the very reason that
   the Spirit of Jesus and His apostles is counted as their origin. Almost
   within the lifetime of disciples of Jesus, the past comes to be
   surrounded with a halo of sanctity, whereby, as ever on such occasions,
   creations of a very late date are uncritically ascribed to earlier
   days. We may even say that we have here the main characteristic of the
   development of churches: the thoroughgoing depreciation of the present,
   while the past is idealized and artificially extolled, and the period
   of inspiration is sharply distinguished from the period of tradition.
   Genuine and true feelings and reflections have driven men to take up
   this position, but also a certain want of faith in the living God. The
   most important characteristics of this Church, now ante-dated and
   ascribed to the earliest days, were orthodoxy and the episcopal
   constitution. Both were derived from the apostles, but wrongly so, for
   none cared less for just these things than the apostles themselves.
   Adhesion to the Christian religion is now determined by assent to the
   orthodox faith and by subordination to the bishop. All other marks of
   Christianity are only accepted as such when the ecclesiastical
   conditions have been fulfilled.

   It is a characteristic feature of the intellectual development of
   Christianity, which finds expression in theology, that a powerful
   progressive impulse is kept in check by a sound appreciation of the
   value of the original Gospel. Christianity steps forth into the great
   world and assimilates all that appears to be compatible with its own
   peculiar nature. It is continually deriving fresh increment even from
   old Judaistic sources, in its apocalyptic, its ethics, and its
   ecclesiastical ideas. But it is to Hellenism that it especially directs
   its attention, and that in an increasing measure. It preaches Jesus as
   the new God and transforms the badges of Christian membership into
   mysteries. It concludes an alliance with Greek philosophy, at first
   tentatively and cautiously, bases its apologetic upon the ideas of the
   logos and the moral law, speaks even of God Himself in philosophic
   language. Even as early as this we can trace the first beginnings of
   intellectualism, of the transformation of Christianity into a
   philosophy of religion. But when the Gnostic movement began and the
   Gospel threatened to be sacrificed, not only to Hellenism but to the
   whole intermingling of religions in the chaos of peoples, when it
   threatened to disappear altogether in speculations, mysteries,
   asceticisms, superstitions of every kind, then the majority of the
   Christian teachers and bishops at once cried out, "Thus far but no
   further."

   And so instead of promoting its dissolution the Gnostic movement is a
   powerful factor in the preservation of the distinctive features of the
   Christian religion and in the defence of the old faith with its hope
   and ethics. Even though the victory over the mighty enemy was only
   completely won at the cost of the introduction of forcible
   ecclesiastical measures, yet the old Gospel remained unimpaired. In
   this spiritual struggle for existence Jesus Himself reacts against the
   corruption of the work of His life. And therewith the decree goes forth
   that in future the measure of all Christian theology is to be found in
   the Gospel.

   The picture presented to us by the examination of Christian piety is
   altogether lacking in unity, according as we look at the dark or the
   light side. A merely average Christianity prevails throughout the
   congregations, while at the same time the ascetic ideal begins to vie
   for the mastery with that of the Gospel. Documents such as the Epistle
   of St James and the "Shepherd" of Hermas give one a really terrible
   idea of the moral and religious level of many congregations. It would
   often seem as though the Gospel had lost much of its old power through
   its alliance with the world. And yet such an impression would be
   incomplete. There can be no doubt that even in this age the
   congregations are better than their surroundings, that through the
   preaching of Jesus and the presence of living Christians in their midst
   they possess and can offer something which the whole world lacks. But
   everything depends upon the individuals. In many writings of our age we
   can trace, not merely the Christian ideal, but its realization in
   individuals. We may venture to say that men and women existed in all
   congregations whose lives mightily inspired their fellow-Christians in
   times of weakness as well as in the day of strife, inspired them with
   hope and moral grandeur, with brotherly love and trust in God. Where
   such lives are lived there is Jesus with His redemption, and there is
   the living God: there, too, is the bright promise of the future, hope
   for the progress of Christianity through out the world's history.
