   Preface.

   ------------------------

   The present translation of the Catechetical Lectures of S. Cyril of
   Jerusalem is based on a careful revision of the English translation
   published in the "Library of the Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church,"
   with a most interesting Preface by John Henry Newman, dated from
   Oxford, The Feast of St. Matthew, 1838.

   In his Preface Mr. Newman stated with respect to the translation "that
   for almost the whole of it the Editors were indebted to Mr. Church,
   Fellow of Oriel College."  Mr. Church was at that time a very young
   man, having taken his First Class in Michaelmas Term, 1836; and this
   his first published work gave abundant promise of that peculiar
   felicity of expression, which made him in maturer life one of the most
   perfect masters of the English tongue.  Having received full liberty to
   make such use of his translation as I might deem most desirable for the
   purpose of the present Edition, I have been obliged to exercise my own
   judgment both in preserving much of Dean Church's work unaltered, and
   in revising it wherever the meaning of the original appeared to be less
   perfectly expressed.

   In this constant study and use of Dean Church's earliest work I have
   had always before my mind a grateful and inspiring remembrance of one
   whose friendship it was my great privilege to enjoy during the few last
   saddened years of his saintly and noble life.

   In the notes of the Edition one of my chief objects has been to
   illustrate S. Cyril's teaching by comparing it with the works of
   earlier Fathers to whom he may have been indebted, and with the
   writings of his contemporaries.

   In the chapters of the Introduction which touch on S. Cyril's doctrines
   of Baptism, Chrism, and the Holy Eucharist, I have not attempted either
   to criticise or to defend his teaching, but simply to give as faithful
   a representation as I could of his actual meaning.  The Eastern Church
   had long before S. Cyril's day, and still has its own peculiar
   Sacramental doctrines, which, notwithstanding the efforts of rival
   theologians, can never be reduced to exact conformity with the tenets
   of our own or other Western Churches.

   The Indices have been revised, and large additions made to the lists of
   Greek words,

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   Chapter I.--Life of S. Cyril.

   The works of S. Cyril of Jerusalem owe much of their peculiar interest
   and value to the character of the times in which he wrote. Born a few
   years before the outbreak of

   Arianism in a.d. 318, he lived to see its suppression by the Edict of
   Theodosius, 380, and to take part in its condemnation by the Council of
   Constantinople in the following year.

   The story of Cyril's life is not told in detail by any contemporary
   author; in his own writings there is little mention of himself; and the
   Church historians refer only to  the events of his manhood and old
   age.  We have thus no direct knowledge of his early years, and can only
   infer from the later circumstances of his life what may probably have
   been the nature of his previous training.  The names of his parents are
   quite unknown; but in the Greek Menæa, or monthly catalogues of Saints,
   and in the Roman Martyrology for the 18th day of March, Cyril is said
   to have been "born of pious parents, professing the orthodox Faith, and
   to have been bred up in the same, in the reign of Constantine."  This
   account of his parentage and education derives some probability from
   the fact that Cyril nowhere speaks as one who had been converted from
   paganism or from any heretical sect.  His language at the close of the
   vii^th Lecture seems rather to be inspired by gratitude to his own
   parents for a Christian education:  "The first virtuous observance in a
   Christian is to honour his parents, to requite their trouble, and to
   provide with all his power for their comfort:  for however much we may
   repay them, yet we can never be to them what they as parents have been
   to us.  Let them enjoy the comfort we can give, and strengthen us with
   blessings."

   One member only of Cyril's family is mentioned by name, his sister's
   son Gelasius, who was appointed by Cyril to be Bishop of Cæsarea on the
   death of Acacius, a.d. 366 circ.

   Cyril himself was probably born, or at least brought up, in or near
   Jerusalem, for it was usual to choose a Bishop from among the Clergy
   over whom he was to preside, a preference being given to such as were
   best known to the people generally [1] .

   That Cyril, whether a native of Jerusalem or not, had passed a portion
   of his childhood there, is rendered probable by his allusions to the
   condition of the Holy Places before they were cleared and adorned by
   Constantine and Helena.  He seems to speak as an eye-witness of their
   former state, when he says that a few years before the place of the
   Nativity at Bethlehem had been wooded [2] , that the place where Christ
   was crucified and buried was a garden, of which traces were still
   remaining [3] , that the wood of the Cross had been distributed to all
   nations [4] , and that before the decoration of the Holy Sepulchre by
   Constantine, there was a cleft or cave before the door of the
   Sepulchre, hewn out of the rock itself, but now no longer to be seen,
   because the outer cave had been cut away for the sake of the recent
   adornments [5] .

   This work was undertaken by Constantine after the year 326 a.d. [6] ;
   and if Cyril spoke from remembrance of what he had himself seen, he
   could hardly have been less than ten or twelve years old, and so must
   have been born not later, perhaps a few years earlier, than 315 a.d.

   The tradition that Cyril had been a monk and an ascetic was probably
   founded upon the passages in which he seems to speak as one who had
   himself belonged to the order of Solitaries, and shared the glory of
   chastity [7] .  We need not, however, suppose that the "Solitaries"
   (monazontes)of whom he speaks were either hermits living in remote and
   desert places, or monks secluded in a monastery:  they commonly lived
   in cities, only in separate houses, and frequented the same Churches
   with ordinary Christians.  To such a life of perpetual chastity, strict
   asceticism, and works of charity, Cyril may probably, in accordance
   with the custom of the age, have been devoted from early youth.

   A more important question is that which relates to the time and
   circumstances of his ordination as Deacon, and as Priest, matters
   closely connected with some of the chief troubles of his later life.

   That he was ordained Deacon by Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem, who died
   in 334 or 335, may be safely inferred from the unfriendly notice of S.
   Jerome, Chron. ann. 349 (350 a.d.):  "Cyril having been ordained Priest
   by Maximus, and after his death permitted by Acacius, Bishop of
   Cæsarea, and the other Arian Bishops, to be made Bishop on condition of
   repudiating his ordination by Maximus, served in the Church as a
   Deacon:  and after he had been paid for this impiety by the reward of
   the Episcopate (Sacerdotii), he by various plots harassed Heraclius,
   whom Maximus when dying had substituted in his own place, and degraded
   him from Bishop to Priest."

   From this account, incredible as it is in the main, and strongly marked
   by personal prejudice, we may conclude that Cyril had been ordained
   Deacon not by Maximus, but by his predecessor Macarius; for otherwise
   he would have been compelled to renounce his Deacon's Orders, as well
   as his Priesthood.

   Macarius died in or before the year 335; for at the Council of Tyre,
   assembled in that year to condemn Athanasius, Maximus sat as successor
   to Macarius in the See of Jerusalem [8] .  This date is confirmed by
   the fact that after the accession of Maximus, a great assembly of
   Bishops was held at Jerusalem in the year 335, for the dedication of
   the Church of the Holy Resurrection [9] .

   It thus appears that Cyril's ordination as Deacon cannot be put later
   than 334 or the beginning of 335.

   Towards the close of the latter year the Bishops who had deposed
   Athanasius at the Council of Tyre proceeded to Jerusalem "to celebrate
   the Tricennalia of Constantine's reign by consecrating his grand Church
   on Mount Calvary [10] ."  On that occasion "Jerusalem became the
   gathering point for distinguished prelates from every province, and the
   whole city was thronged by a vast assemblage of the servants of
   God......In short, the whole of Syria and Mesopotamia, Phoenicia and
   Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, with the dwellers in the Thebaid,
   all contributed to swell the mighty concourse of God's ministers,
   followed as they were by vast numbers from every province.  They were
   attended by an imperial escort, and officers of trust had also been
   sent from the palace itself, with instructions to heighten the
   splendour of the festival at the Emperor's expense [11] ."  Eusebius
   proceeds to describe the splendid banquets, the lavish distribution of
   money and clothes to the naked and destitute, the offerings of imperial
   magnificence, the "intellectual feast" of the many Bishops' discourses,
   and last, not least, his own "various public orations pronounced in
   honour of this solemnity."  Among the Clergy taking part in this
   gorgeous ceremony, the newly ordained Deacon of the Church of Jerusalem
   would naturally have his place.  It was a scene which could not fail to
   leave a deep impression on his mind, and to influence his attitude
   towards the contending parties in the great controversy by which the
   Church was at this time distracted.  He knew that Athanasius had just
   been deposed, he had seen Arius triumphantly restored to communion in
   that august assembly of Bishops "from every province," with his own
   Bishop Maximus, and Eusebius of Cæsarea, the Metropolitan, at their
   head.  It is much to the praise of his wisdom and steadfastness that he
   was not misled by the notable triumph of the Arians to join their
   faction or adopt their tenets.

   In September, 346, Athanasius returning from his second exile at Trèves
   passed through Jerusalem.  The aged Bishop Maximus, who had been
   induced to acquiesce in the condemnation of Athanasius at Tyre, and in
   the solemn recognition of Arius at Jerusalem, had afterwards refused to
   join the Eusebians at Antioch in 341, for the purpose of confirming the
   sentence passed at Tyre, and now gave a cordial welcome to Athanasius,
   who thus describes his reception [12] :  "As I passed through Syria, I
   met with the Bishops of Palestine, who, when they had called a Council
   at Jerusalem, received me cordially, and themselves also sent me on my
   way in peace, and addressed the following letter to the Church and the
   Bishops [13] ."  The letter congratulating the Egyptian Bishops and the
   Clergy and people of Alexandria on the restoration of their Bishop is
   signed first by Maximus, who seems to have acted without reference to
   the Metropolitan Acacius, successor of Eusebius as Bishop of Cæsarea,
   and a leader of the Arians, a bitter enemy of Athanasius.  Though Cyril
   in his writings never mentions Athanasius or Arius by name, we can
   hardly doubt that, as Touttée suggests [14] , he must at this time have
   had an opportunity of learning the true character of the questions in
   dispute between the parties of the great heresiarch and his greater
   adversary.

   We have already learned from Jerome that Cyril was admitted to the
   Priesthood by Maximus.  There is no evidence of the exact date of his
   ordination:  but we may safely assume that he was a Priest of some
   years' standing, when the important duty of preparing the candidates
   for Baptism was intrusted to him in or about the year 348 [15] .  There
   appears to be no authority for the statement (Dict. Chr. Antiq.
   "Catechumens," p. 319 a), that  the Catecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem
   were delivered by him partly as a Deacon, partly as a Presbyter [16] ."

   At the very time of delivering the lectures, Cyril was also in the
   habit of preaching to the general congregation on the Lord's day [17] ,
   when the candidates for Baptism were especially required to be present
   [18] .  In the Church of Jerusalem it was still the custom for sermons
   to be preached by several Presbyters in succession, the Bishop
   preaching last.  From Cyril's Homily on the Paralytic (§ 20) we learn
   that he preached immediately before the Bishop, and so must have held a
   distinguished position among the Priests.  This is also implied in the
   fact, that within three or four years after delivering his Catechetical
   Lectures to the candidates for Baptism, he was chosen to succeed
   Maximus in the See of Jerusalem.

   The date of his consecration is approximately determined by his own
   letter to Constantius concerning the appearance of a luminous cross in
   the sky at Jerusalem.  The letter was written on the 7th of May, 351,
   and is described by Cyril as the first-fruit of his Episcopate.  He
   must therefore have been consecrated in 350, or early in 351.

   Socrates and Sozomen agree in the assertion that Acacius, Patrophilus
   the Arian Bishop of Scythopolis, and their adherents ejected Maximus
   and put Cyril in his place [19] .  But according to the statement of
   Jerome already quoted [20] Maximus, when dying, had not only nominated
   Heraclius to be his successor, which, with the consent of the Clergy
   and people was not unusual, but had actually established him as Bishop
   in his stead (in suum locum substituerat).  The two accounts are
   irreconcileable, and both improbable.  Touttée argues not without
   reason, that the consecration of Heraclius, which Jerome attributes to
   Maximus, would have been opposed to the right of the people and Clergy
   to nominate their own Bishop, and to the authority of the Metropolitan
   and other Bishops of the province, by whom the choice was to be
   confirmed and the consecration performed, and that it had moreover been
   expressly forbidden seven years before by the 23rd Canon of the Council
   of Antioch.

   Still more improbable is the charge that Cyril had renounced the
   priesthood conferred on him by Maximus, and after serving in the Church
   as a Deacon, had been rewarded by the Episcopate, and then himself
   degraded Heraclius from Bishop to Priest.  As a solution of these
   difficulties, it is suggested by Reischl [21] that Cyril had been
   designated in the lifetime of Maximus as his successor, and after his
   decease had been duly and canonically consecrated, but had incurred the
   calumnious charges of the party opposed to Acacius and the Eusebians,
   because he was supposed to have bound himself to them by accepting
   consecration at their hands.  This view is in some measure confirmed by
   the fact that "in the great controversy of the day Cyril belonged to
   the Asiatic party, Jerome to that of Rome.  In the Meletian schism also
   they took opposite sides, Cyril supporting Meletius, Jerome being a
   warm adherent of Paulinus [22] ," by whom he had been recently ordained
   Priest.  It is also worthy of notice that Jerome's continuation of the
   Chronicle of Eusebius was written at Constantinople in 380-381, the
   very time when the many injurious charges fabricated by Cyril's bitter
   enemies were most industriously circulated in popular rumour on the eve
   of a judicial inquiry by the second general Council which met there in
   381, under the presidency of Meletius, Cyril, and Gregory of Nazianzum
   [23] .  Had Jerome written of Cyril a year or two later, he must have
   known that these calumnies had been emphatically rejected by the Synod
   of Constantinople (382) consisting of nearly the same Bishops who had
   been present at the Council of the preceding year.  In their Synodical
   letter [24] to Pope Damasus they wrote:  "And of the Church in
   Jerusalem, which is the Mother of all the Churches, we notify that the
   most reverend and godly Cyril is Bishop:  who was long ago canonically
   appointed by the Bishops of the Province, and had many conflicts in
   various places against the Arians."

   The beginning of Cyril's Episcopate was marked by the appearance of a
   bright Cross in the sky, about nine o'clock in the morning of
   Whitsunday, the 7th of May, 351 a.d.  Brighter than the sun, it hung
   over the hill of Golgotha, and extended to Mount Olivet, being visible
   for many hours.  The whole population of Jerusalem, citizens and
   foreigners, Christians and Pagans, young and old, flocked to the
   Church, singing the praises of Christ, and hailing the phænomenon as a
   sign from heaven confirming the truth of the Christian religion.

   Cyril regarded the occasion as favourable for announcing to the Emperor
   Constantius the commencement of his Episcopate; and in his extant
   letter described the sign as a proof of God's favour towards the Empire
   and its Christian ruler.  The piety of his father Constantine had been
   rewarded by the discovery of the true Cross and the Holy places:  and
   now the greater devotion of the Son had won a more signal manifestation
   of Divine approval.  The letter ends with a prayer that God may grant
   to the Emperor long to reign as the protector of the Church and of the
   Empire, "ever glorifying the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, our true
   God."  The word homoousion, it is alleged, had not at this time been
   accepted by Cyril, and its use has therefore been thought to cast doubt
   upon the genuineness of this final prayer, which is nevertheless
   maintained by the Benedictine Editor [25] .  The letter as a whole is
   certainly genuine, and the phenomenon is too strongly attested by the
   historians of the period to be called in question.  While, therefore,
   we must reject Cyril's explanation, we have no reason to suspect him of
   intentional misrepresentation.  A parhelion, or other remarkable
   phenomenon, of which the natural cause was at that time unknown, might
   well appear "to minds excited by the struggle between the Christian
   Faith and a fast-declining heathenism to be a miraculous manifestation
   of the symbol of Redemption, intended to establish the Faith and to
   confute its gainsayers [26] ."

   The first few years of Cyril's episcopate fell within that so-called
   "Golden Decade," 346-355, which is otherwise described as "an uneasy
   interval of suspense rather than of peace [27] ."  Though soon to be
   engaged in a dispute with Acacius concerning the privileges of their
   respective Sees, Cyril seems to have been in the interval zealous and
   successful in promoting the peace and prosperity of his own Diocese.

   We learn from a letter of Basil the Great that he had visited Jerusalem
   about the year 357, when he had been recently baptized, and was
   preparing to adopt a life of strict asceticism.  He speaks of the many
   saints whom he had there embraced, and of the many who had fallen on
   their knees before him, and touched his hands as holy [28] ,--signs, as
   Touttée suggests, of a flourishing state of religion and piety.
   Cyril's care for the poor, and his personal poverty, were manifested by
   an incident, of which the substantial truth is proved by the malicious
   use to which it was afterwards perverted.  "Jerusalem and the
   neighbouring region being visited with a famine, the poor in great
   multitudes, being destitute of necessary food, turned their eyes upon
   Cyril as their Bishop.  As he had no money to succour them in their
   need, he sold the treasures and sacred veils of the Church.  It is
   said, therefore, that some one recognised an offering of his own as
   worn by an actress on the stage, and made it his business to inquire
   whence she had it, and found that it had been sold to her by a
   merchant, and to the merchant by the Bishop [29] ."

   This was one of the charges brought against Cyril in the course of the
   disputes between himself and Acacius, which had commenced soon after he
   had been installed in the Bishopric of Jerusalem.  As Bishop of
   Cæsarea, Acacius exercised Metropolitan jurisdiction over the Bishops
   of Palestine.  But Cyril, as presiding over an Apostolic See, "the
   Mother of all the Churches," claimed exemption from the jurisdiction of
   Cæsarea, and higher rank than its Bishop.  It is not alleged, nor is it
   in any way probable, that Cyril claimed also the jurisdiction over
   other Bishops.  The rights and privileges of his See had been clearly
   defined many years before by the 7th Canon of the Council of Nicæa:
   "As custom and ancient tradition shew that the Bishop of Ælia ought to
   be honoured, let him have precedence in honour, without prejudice to
   the proper dignity of the Metropolitical See."  Eusebius [30] , in
   reference to a Synod concerning the time of Easter, says:  "There is
   still extant a writing of those who were then assembled in Palestine
   (about 200 a.d.), over whom Theophilus, Bishop of Cæsarea, and
   Narcissus, Bishop of Jerusalem, presided."  If one Synod only is here
   meant, it would appear that the Bishop of Cæsarea took precedence of
   the Bishop of Jerusalem, which would be the natural order in a Synod
   held at Cæsarea.  Bishop Hefele, however, takes a different view [31]
   :  "According to the Synodicon, two Synods were held in Palestine on
   the subject of the Easter controversy:  the one at Jerusalem presided
   over by Narcissus, and composed of fourteen Bishops; and the other at
   Cæsarea, comprising twelve Bishops, and presided over by Theophilus."
   In confirmation of this view we may observe that when next Eusebius
   mentions Narcissus and Theophilus, he reverses the previous order, and
   names the Bishop of Jerusalem first.

   However this may have been, Acacius, who as an Arian was likely to have
   little respect for the Council of Nicæa, seems to have claimed both
   precedence and jurisdiction over Cyril.  From [32] Socrates we learn
   that Cyril was frequently summoned to submit to the judgment of
   Acacius, but for two whole years refused to appear.  He was therefore
   deposed by Acacius and the other Arian Bishops of Palestine on the
   charge of having sold the property of the Church, as before mentioned.
   Socrates, who confesses that he does not know for what Cyril was
   accused, yet suggests that he was afraid to meet the accusations [33]
   .  But Theodoret, a more impartial witness, says [34] that Acacius took
   advantage of some slight occasion (aphormas) and deposed him.  Sozomen
   [35] also describes the accusation as a pretext (epi prophasei toiade),
   and the deposition as hastily decreed, to forestall any countercharge
   of heresy by Cyril (phthanei kathelon).  The deposition was quickly
   followed by Cyril's expulsion from Jerusalem, and a certain Eutychius
   was appointed to succeed him [36] .  Passing by Antioch, which at this
   time, 357-358, was left without a Bishop by the recent decease of the
   aged Arian Leontius Castratus [37] , Cyril took refuge in Tarsus with
   its Bishop the "admirable Silvanus," "one of the Semi-Arians," who, as
   Athanasius testifies, agreed almost entirely with the Nicene doctrine,
   only taking offence at the expression homoousios, because in their
   opinion it contained latent Sabellianism [38] ."  Cyril now sent to the
   Bishops who had deposed him a formal notice that he appealed to a
   higher Court (meizon epekalesato dikasterion ), and his appeal was
   approved by the Emperor Constantius [39] .  Acasius, on learning the
   place of Cyril's retreat, wrote to Silvanus announcing his deposition.
   But Silvanus out of respect both to Cyril, and to the people, who were
   delighted with his teaching, still permitted him to exercise his
   ministry in the Church.  Socrates finds fault with Cyril for his
   appeal:  "In this," he says, "he was the first and only one who acted
   contrary to the custom of the Ecclesiastical Canon, by having recourse
   to appeals as in a civil court."  The reproach implied in this
   statement is altogether undeserved.  The question, as Touttée argues,
   is not whether others had done the like before or after, but whether
   Cyril's appeal was in accordance with natural justice, and the custom
   of the Church.  On the latter point he refers to the case of the
   notorious heretic Photinus, who after being condemned in many Councils
   appealed to the Emperor, and was allowed to dispute in his presence
   with Basil the Great as his opponent.  Athanasius himself, in
   circumstances very similar to Cyril's, declined to appear before
   Eusebius and a Synod of Arian Bishops at Cæsarea, by whom he was
   condemned a.d. 334, and appealed in person to Constantine, requesting
   either that a lawful Council of Bishops might be assembled, or that the
   Emperor would himself receive his defence. [40] "

   In justification of Cyril's appeal it is enough to say that it was
   impossible for him to submit to the judgment of Acacius and his Arian
   colleagues.  They could not be impartial in a matter where the
   jurisdiction of Acacius their president, and his unsoundness in the
   Faith, were as much in question as any of the charges brought against
   Cyril.  He took the only course open to him in requesting the Emperor
   to remit his case to the higher jurisdiction of a greater Council, and
   in giving formal notice of this appeal to the Bishops who had expelled
   him.

   While the appeal was pending, Cyril became acquainted with " the
   learned Bishop, Basil of Ancyra " (Hefele), with Eustathius of Sebaste
   in Armenia, and George of Laodicea, the chief leaders of the party
   "usually (since Epiphanius), but with some injustice, designated
   Semi-Arian [41] ."  One of the charges brought against Cyril in the
   Council of Constantinople (360, a.d.) was, as we shall see, that he
   held communion with these Bishops.

   Cyril had not long to wait for the hearing of his appeal.  In the year
   359 the Eastern Bishops met at Seleucia in Isauria, and the Western at
   Ariminum.  Constantius had at first wished to convene a general Council
   of all the Bishops of the Empire, but this intention he was induced to
   abandon by representations of the long journeys and expense, and he
   therefore directed the two Synods then assembled at Ariminum and at
   Seleucia "the Rugged" to investigate first the disputes concerning the
   Faith, and then to turn their attention to the complaints of Cyril, and
   other Bishops against unjust decrees of deposition and banishment [42]
   .  This order of proceeding was discussed, and after much controversy
   adopted on the first day of meeting, the 27th of September [43] .  On
   the second day Acacius and his friends refused to remain unless the
   Bishops already deposed, or under accusation, were excluded.  Theodoret
   relates that " several friends of peace tried to persuade Cyril of
   Jerusalem to withdraw, but that, as he would not comply, Acacius left
   the assembly [44] ."  Three days afterwards, according to Sozomen, a
   third meeting was held at which the demand of Acacius was complied
   with; "for the Bishops of the opposite party were determined that he
   should have no pretext for dissolving the Council, which was evidently
   his object in order to prevent the impending examination of the heresy
   of Aëtius and of the accusations which had been brought against him and
   his partisans [45] ."  A creed put forward by Acacius having been
   rejected, he refused to attend any further meetings, though repeatedly
   summoned to be present at an investigation of his own charges against
   Cyril.

   In the end Acacius and many of his friends were deposed or
   excommunicated.  Some of these, however, in defiance of the sentence of
   the Council, returned to their dioceses, as did also the majority who
   had deposed them.

   It is not expressly stated whether any formal decision on the case of
   Cyril was adopted by the Council:  but as his name does not appear in
   the lists of those who were deposed or excommunicated, it is certain
   that he was not condemned.  It is most probable that the charges
   against him were disregarded after his accuser Acacius had refused to
   appear, and that he returned, like the others, to his diocese.  But he
   was not to be left long in peace.  Acacius and some of his party had
   hastened to Constantinople, where they gained over to their cause the
   chief men attached to the palace, and through their influence secured
   the favour of Constantius, and roused his anger against the majority of
   the Council.  But what especially stirred the Emperor's wrath were the
   charges which Acacius concocted against Cyril:  "For," he said that
   "the holy robe which the Emperor Constantine of blessed memory, in his
   desire to honour the Church of Jerusalem, had presented to Macarius,
   the Bishop of that city, to be worn when he administered the rite of
   Holy Baptism, all fashioned as it was with golden threads, had been
   sold by Cyril, and bought by one of the dancers at the theatre, who had
   put it on, and while dancing had fallen, and injured himself, and
   died.  With such an ally as this Cyril," he said, "they undertake to
   judge and pass sentence upon the rest of the world [46] ."

   Ten deputies who at the close of the Council of Seleucia had been
   appointed to report its proceedings to the Emperor, "met, on their
   arrival at the Court, the deputies of the Council of Ariminum, and
   likewise the partisans of Acacius [47] .  After much controversy and
   many intrigues, a mutilated and ambiguous Creed adopted at Ariminum in
   which the homoousios of Nicæa was replaced by "like to the Father that
   begat Him according to the Scriptures," and the mention of either
   "essence" (ousia) or "subsistence" (hupostasis) condemned [48] , was
   brought forward and approved by the Emperor.  "After having, on the
   last day of the year 359, discussed the matter with the Bishops till
   far into the night [49] , he at length extorted their signatures....It
   is in this connexion that Jerome says:  Ingemuit totus orbis, et
   Arianum se esse miratus est [50] ."  Early in the following year, 360
   a.d., through the influence of Acacius a new Synod was held at
   Constantinople, in which, among other Semi-Arian Bishops, Cyril also
   was deposed on the charge of having held communion with Eustathius of
   Sebaste, Basil of Ancyra, and George of Laodicea.  Cyril, as we have
   seen, had become acquainted with these Bishops during his residence at
   Tarsus in 358, at which time they were all zealous opponents of Acacius
   and his party, but differed widely in other respects.

   George of Laodicea was a profligate in morals, and an Arian at heart,
   whose opposition to Acacius and Eudoxius was prompted by self-interest
   rather than by sincere conviction.  He had been deposed from the
   priesthood by Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, both on that ground of
   false doctrine, and of the open and habitual irregularities of his
   life.  Athanasius styles him "the most wicked of all the Arians,"
   reprobated even by his own party for his grossly dissolute conduct [51]
   .

   Basil of Ancyra was a man of high moral character, great learning, and
   powerful intellect, a consistent opponent both of the Sabellianism of
   Marcellus, and of every form of Arian and Anomoean heresy, a chief
   among those of whom Athanasius wrote [52] , "We discuss the matter with
   them as brothers with brothers, who mean what we mean, and dispute only
   about the word (homoousios)....Now such is Basil who wrote from Ancyra
   concerning the Faith" (358 a.d., the same year in which Cyril met him
   at Tarsus).

   Eustathius is described as a man unstable in doctrine, vacillating from
   party to party, subscribing readily to Creeds of various tendency, yet
   commanding the respect even of his enemies by a life of extraordinary
   holiness, in which active benevolence was combined with extreme
   austerity.  "He was a man," says Mr. Gwatkin [53] , "too active to be
   ignored, too unstable to be trusted, too famous for ascetic piety to be
   lightly made an open enemy."

   S. Basil the Great, when travelling from place to place, to observe the
   highest forms of ascetic life, had met with Eustathius at Tarsus, and
   formed a lasting friendship with a man whom he describes as "exhibiting
   something above human excellence," and of whom, after the painful
   dissensions which embittered Basil's later life, that great saint could
   say, that from childhood to extreme old age he (Eustathius) had watched
   over himself with the greatest care, the result of his self-discipline
   being seen in his life and character [54] .

   Of any intimate friendship between Cyril, and these Semi-Arian leaders,
   we have no evidence in the vague charges of Acacius:  their common
   fault was that they condemned him in the Synod of Seleucia.  The true
   reason of Cyril's deposition, barely concealed by the frivolous charges
   laid against him, was the hatred of Acacius, incurred by the refusal to
   acknowledge the Metropolitan jurisdiction of the See of Cæsarea.  The
   deposition was confirmed by Constantius, and followed by a sentence of
   banishment.  The place of Cyril's exile is not mentioned; nor is it
   known whether he joined in the protest of the other deposed Bishops,
   described by S. Basil, Epist. 75.  His banishment was not of longer
   continuance than two years.  Constantius died on the 3rd of November,
   361, and the accession of Julian was soon followed by the recall of all
   the exiled Bishops, orthodox and heretical, and the restoration of
   their confiscated estates [55] .  Julian's object, according to
   Socrates, was " to brand the memory of Constantius by making him appear
   to have been cruel towards his subjects."  An equally amiable motive
   imputed to him is mentioned by Sozomen:  "It is said that he issued
   this order in their behalf not out of mercy, but that through
   contention among themselves the Church might be involved in fraternal
   strife [56] ."  Cyril, returning with the other Bishops, seems to have
   passed through Antioch on his way home, and to have been well received
   by the excellent Bishop Meletius.

   It happened that the son of a heathen priest attached to the Emperor's
   Court, having been instructed in his youth by a Deaconess whom he
   visited with his mother, had secretly become a Christian.  On
   discovering this, his father had cruelly scourged and burnt him with
   hot spits on his hands, and feet, and back.  He contrived to escape,
   and took refuge with his friend the Deaconess.  "She dressed me in
   women's garments, and took me in her covered carriage to the divine
   Meletius.  He handed me over to the Bishop of Jerusalem, at that time
   Cyril, and we started by night for Palestine.'  After the death of
   Julian, this young man led his father also into the way of truth.  This
   act he told me with the rest [57] ."

   The next incident recorded in the life of S. Cyril is his alleged
   prediction of the failure of Julian's attempt to rebuild the Temple of
   Jerusalem.  "The vain and ambitious mind of Julian," says Gibbon,
   "might aspire to restore the ancient glory of the Temple of Jerusalem.
   As the Christians were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting
   destruction had been pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic
   law, the Imperial sophist would have converted the success of his
   undertaking into a specious argument against the faith of prophecy and
   the truth of revelation."  Again he writes:  "The Christians
   entertained a natural and pious expectation, that in this memorable
   contest, the honour of religion would be vindicated by some signal
   miracle [58] ."  That such an expectation may have been shared by Cyril
   is not impossible:  but there is no satisfactory evidence that he
   ventured to foretell any miraculous interposition.  According to the
   account of Rufinus [59] , "lime and cement had been brought, and all
   was ready for destroying the old foundations and laying new on the next
   day.  But Cyril remained undismayed, and after careful consideration
   either of what he had read in Daniel's prophecy concerning the times,'
   or of our Lord's predictions in the Gospels, persisted that it was
   impossible that one stone should ever there be laid upon another by the
   Jews."  This account of Cyril's expectation, though probable enough in
   itself, seems to be little more than a conjecture founded on his
   statement (Cat. xv. 15), that "Antichrist will come at the time when
   there shall not be left one stone upon another in the Temple of the
   Jews."  That doom was not completed in Cyril's time, nor did he expect
   it to be fulfilled until the coming of the Jewish Antichrist, who was
   to restore the Temple shortly before the end of the world.  It was
   impossible for Cyril to see in Julian such an Antichrist as he has
   described; and therefore, without any gift or pretence of prophecy, he
   might very well express a firm conviction that the attempted
   restoration at that time must fail.  Though Gibbon is even more cynical
   and contemptuous than usual in his examination of the alleged miracles,
   he does not attempt to deny the main facts of the story [60] :  with
   their miraculous character we are not here concerned, but only with
   Cyril's conduct on so remarkable an occasion.

   In the same year, a.d. 363, Julian was killed in his Persian campaign
   on the 26th of June, and was succeeded by Jovian, whose universal
   tolerance, and personal profession of the Nicene faith, though
   discredited by the looseness of his morals, gave an interval of
   comparative rest to the Church.  In his reign Athanasius was recalled,
   and Acacius and his friends subscribed the Nicene Creed, with an
   explanation of the sense in which they accepted the word homoousion
   [61] .  As Cyril's name is not mentioned in any of the records of
   Jovian's short reign of seven months, we may infer that he dwelt in
   peace at Jerusalem.

   Jovian died on the 17th of February, 364, and was succeeded by
   Valentinian, who in the following March gave over the Eastern provinces
   of the Empire to his brother Valens.  During the first two years of the
   new reign we hear nothing of Cyril:  but at the beginning of the year
   366, on the death of his old enemy Acacius, Cyril assumed the right to
   nominate his successor in the See of Cæsarea, and appointed a certain
   Philumenus [62] .  Whether this assumption of authority was in
   accordance with the 7th Canon of Nicæa may be doubted:  Cyril's choice
   of his nephew was, however, in after times abundantly justified by the
   conduct and character of Gelasius, who is described by Theodoret as a
   man "distinguished by the purity of his doctrine, and the sanctity of
   his life," and is quoted by the same historian as "the admirable," and
   "the blessed Gelasius [63] ."

   Epiphanius relates [64] that "after these three had been set up, and
   could do nothing on account of mutual contentions," Euzoius was
   appointed by the Arians, and held the See until the accession of
   Theodosius in a.d. 379, when he was deposed, and Gelasius restored.  In
   the meantime Cyril had been a third time deposed and driven from
   Jerusalem, probably in the year 367.  For at that time Valens, who had
   fallen under the influence of Eudoxius, the Arian Bishop of
   Constantinople, by whom he was baptized, "wrote to the Governors of the
   provinces, commanding that all Bishops who had been banished by
   Constantius, and had again assumed their sacerdotal offices under the
   Emperor Julian, should be ejected from their Churches [65] ."  Of this
   third and longest banishment we have no particulars, but we may safely
   apply to it the words of the Synod at Constantinople, 382, that Cyril "
   had passed through very many contests with the Arians in various
   places."

   The terrible defeat and miserable death of Valens in the great battle
   against the Goths at Adrianople (a.d. 378) brought a respite to the
   defenders of the Nicene doctrine.  For Gratian "disapproved of the late
   persecution that had been carried on for the purpose of checking the
   diversities in religious Creeds, and recalled all those who had been
   banished on account of their religion [66] ."  Gratian associated
   Theodosius with himself in the Empire on the 19th of January, 379; and
   "at this period," says Sozomen [67] , "all the Churches of the East,
   with the exception of that of Jerusalem, were in the hands of the
   Arians."  Cyril, therefore, had been one of the first to return to his
   own See.  During his long absence the Church of Jerusalem had been the
   prey both of Arianism and of the new heresy of Apollinarius, which had
   spread among the monks who were settled on Mount Olivet.  Egyptian
   Bishops, banished for their orthodoxy, having taken refuge in
   Palestine, there found themselves excluded from communion.  Jerusalem
   was given over to heresy and schism, to the violent strife of rival
   factions, and to extreme licentiousness of morals.

   Gregory of Nyssa, who had been commissioned by a Council held at
   Antioch in 378 to visit the Churches in Arabia and Palestine, "because
   matters with them were in confusion, and needed an arbiter," gives a
   mournful account both of the distracted state of the Church, and of the
   prevailing corruption.  "If the Divine grace were more abundant about
   Jerusalem than elsewhere, sin would not be so much the fashion among
   those who live there , but as it is, there is no form of uncleanness
   that is not perpetrated among them; rascality, adultery, theft,
   idolatry, poisoning, quarrelling, murder, are rife."  In a letter [68]
   written after his return to Cæsarea in Cappadocia he asks, "What means
   this opposing array of new Altars?  Do we announce another Jesus?  Do
   we produce other Scriptures?  Have any of ourselves dared to say
   "Mother of Man" of the Holy Virgin, the Mother of God?

   In the year a.d. 381 Theodosius summoned the Bishops of his division of
   the Empire to meet in Council at Constantinople, in order to settle the
   disputes by which the Eastern Church had been so long distracted, and
   to secure the triumph of the Nicene Faith over the various forms of
   heresy which had arisen in the half-century which had elapsed since the
   first General Council.  Among the Bishops present were Cyril of
   Jerusalem, and his nephew Gelasius, who on the death of Valens had
   regained possession of the See of Cæsarea from the Arian intruder
   Euzoius.  Cyril is described by Sozomen [69] as one of three recognised
   leaders of the orthodox party, and, according to Bishop Hefele [70] ,
   as sharing the presidency with the Bishops of Alexandria and Antioch.
   This latter point, however, is not clearly expressed in the statement
   of Sozomen.  Socrates writes that Cyril at this time recognised the
   doctrine of homoousion, having retracted his former opinion:  and
   Sozomen says that he had at this period renounced the tenets of the
   Macedonians which he previously held [71] .  Touttée rightly rejects
   these reproaches as unfounded:  they are certainly opposed to all his
   teaching in the Catechetical Lectures, where the doctrine of Christ's
   unity of essence with the Father is fully and frequently asserted,
   though the term homoousios is not used, and the co-equal Deity of the
   Holy Ghost is everywhere maintained.

   We find no further mention of Cyril in the proceedings of the Council
   itself.  As consisting of Eastern Bishops only, its authority was not
   at first acknowledged, nor its acts approved in the Western Church.
   The two Synods held later in the same year at Aquileia and at Milan,
   sent formal protests to Theodosius, and urged him to summon a General
   Council at Alexandria or at Rome.  But instead of complying with this
   request, the Emperor summoned the Bishops of his Empire to a fresh
   Synod at Constantinople, and there in the summer of 382 very nearly the
   same Bishops were assembled who had been present at the Council of the
   preceding year.  Their Synodical letter addressed to the Bishops
   assembled at Rome is preserved by Theodoret [72] and in it we read as
   follows:  "Of the Church in Jerusalem, the Mother of all the Churches,
   we make known that Cyril the most reverend and most beloved of God is
   Bishop; and that he was canonically ordained long ago by the Bishops of
   the province, and that he has very often fought a good fight in various
   places against the Arians."  Thus justice was done at last to one whose
   prudence, moderation, and love of peace, had exposed him in those days
   of bitter controversy to undeserved suspicion and relentless
   persecution.  His justification by the Council is the last recorded
   incident in Cyril's life.  We are told by Jerome that he held
   undisturbed possession of his See for eight years under Theodosius.
   The eighth year of Theodosius was a.d. 386, and in the Roman
   Martyrology, the 18th of March in that year is marked as "The birthday
   (Natalis,' i.e. of his heavenly life) of Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem,
   who after suffering many wrongs from the Arians for the sake of the
   Faith, and having been several times driven from his See, became at
   length renowned for the glory of sanctity, and rested in peace:  an
   Ecumenical Council in a letter to Damasus gave a noble testimony to his
   untarnished faith."

   Chapter II.--Catechetical Instruction.

   § 1.  Catechesis.  The term "Catechesis" in its widest sense includes
   instruction by word of mouth on any subject sacred or profane [73] ,
   but is especially applied to Christian teaching, whether of an
   elementary kind appropriate to new converts, or, as in the famous
   Catechetical School of Alexandria, extending to the higher
   interpretation of Holy Scripture, and the exposition of Christian
   philosophy.

   The earliest known example of a Catechetical work is the "Teaching of
   the Twelve Apostles," which Athanasius names among the "books not
   included in the Canon, but appointed by the Fathers to be read by those
   who are just recently coming to us, and wish to be instructed in the
   word of godliness (katecheisthai ton tes eusebeias logon) [74] ."  The
   use of the Didache for the instruction of recent converts from Paganism
   agrees with its original purpose as stated in the longer title,
   "Teaching of the Lord through the Twelve Apostles for the Gentiles."
   The first six chapters are evidently adapted for those who need
   elementary instruction, more particularly for Catechumens of Gentile
   descent, as distinct from Jewish candidates for Baptism [75] .  The
   remaining chapters of the Didache relate chiefly to the administration
   of Baptism, to Prayer, Fasting, and the services of the Lord's Day, and
   to the celebration of the Agape and Eucharist [76] .  This same
   division of subjects is observed in the two classes of S. Cyril's
   Catechetical Lectures:  the first class, including the Procatechesis,
   consists of XIX Lectures addressed to candidates for Baptism, and these
   are followed by five "Mystagogic" Lectures, so called as being
   explanations of the Sacramental Mysteries to the newly-baptized.

   The Didaché was taken as the basis of other manuals of instruction, as
   is evident from the fact that the greater part of the first six
   chapters is imbedded in " The Apostolical Church Order," supposed to
   date from Egypt in the third century.  The Greek text, with an English
   translation, of the part corresponding with the Didaché, is given in "
   The oldest Church Manual " as Document V.

   A further development of the Didaché, "adapted to the state of the
   Eastern Church in the first half of the fourth century," is contained
   in the Seventh Book of the Apostolical Constitutions of Pseudo-Clement
   of Rome, chs. i.-xxxii.  "Here the Didaché is embodied almost word for
   word, but with significant omissions, alterations, and additions, which
   betray a later age....The Didaché was thus superseded by a more
   complete and timely Church Manual, and disappeared."  Dr. Schaff has
   appended this document also to his edition of the Didaché, noting the
   borrowed passages on the margin, and distinguishing them by spaced type
   in the Greek text, and by italics in the English translation.

   In this work the directions concerning the instruction of Catechumens
   and their Baptism are addressed to the Catechist and the Minister of
   Baptism.  They contain only a short outline (c. xxxix.) of the subjects
   in which the Catechumens are to be instructed, most if not all of which
   are explained at large in Cyril's Lectures:  and in the directions
   concerning Baptism, Chrism, and the Eucharist, the similarity is so
   close, that in many passages of the Constitutions the author seems to
   be referring especially to the use of the Church of Jerusalem.

   From this close affinity with earlier works we may be assured that in
   the Catecheses of Cyril we have trustworthy evidence of the great care
   which the Church had from the beginning bestowed on the instruction and
   training of converts, before admitting them to the privilege of
   Baptism; but beyond this, Cyril's own work has a peculiar value as the
   earliest extant example of a full, systematic, and continuous course of
   such instruction.

   § 2.  Catechist.  The duty of catechizing was not limited to a class of
   persons permanently set apart for that purpose, but all orders of the
   Clergy were accustomed to take part in the work.  Even laymen were
   encouraged to teach children or new converts the first elements of
   religion, as we learn from Cyril's exhortation:  "If thou hast a child
   according to the flesh, admonish him of this now; and if thou hast
   begotten one through catechizing, put him also on his guard [77] ."
   That this remark was addressed not to the Catechumens, but to such of
   the Faithful as happened to be present among his audience, appears from
   what he says elsewhere, "So thou likewise, though not daring before thy
   Baptism to wrestle with the adversaries, yet after thou hast received
   the grace, and art henceforth confident in the armour of righteousness,
   must then do battle, and preach the Gospel, if thou wilt [78] ."

   The more systematic instruction of those who had been already admitted
   to the order of Catechumens was entrusted to persons appointed to this
   special duty.  Thus Origen "was in his eighteenth year when he took
   charge of the Catechetical School at Alexandria," which "was entrusted
   to him alone by Demetrius, who presided over the Church [79] :"  and S.
   Augustine's Treatise, De Catechizandis Rudibus, was addressed to
   Deogratias, who being a Deacon at Carthage, and highly esteemed for his
   skill and success as a Catechist, felt so strongly the importance of
   the work and his own insufficiency, that he wrote to Augustine for
   advice as to the best method of instructing those who were brought to
   him to be taught the first elements of the Christian Faith.

   The final training of the photizomenoi, or candidates for Baptism, was
   undertaken in part by the Bishop himself, but chiefly by a Priest
   specially appointed by him.  Of the part taken by the Bishop mention is
   made by S. Ambrose in a letter to his sister Marcellina (Ep. xx.):  "On
   the following day, which was the Lord's day, after the Lessons and
   Sermon, the Catechumens had been dismissed, and I was delivering the
   Creed to some candidates (Competentes) in the Baptistery of the
   Basilica."

   Of this "delivery of the Creed," which was usually done by a Presbyter,
   we have examples in S. Augustine's Sermons In traditione Symboli,
   ccxii.-ccxiv., each of which contains a brief recapitulation and
   explanation of the several articles of belief.  In Serm. ccxiv., after
   a short introduction, we find the following note inserted by the
   preacher himself.  ["After this preface the whole Creed is to be
   recited, without interposing any discussion.  I believe in God the
   Father Almighty,' and the rest that follows.  Which Creed, thou
   knowest, is not wont to be written:  after it has been said, the
   following discussion (disputatio) is to be added."]

   From the opening words of Sermon ccxiv., and of ccxvi., "ad
   Competentes," it is evident that these were delivered by S. Augustine
   as the first-fruits of his ministry very soon after he had been
   reluctantly ordained Priest (a.d. 391).  Two other examples of
   addresses to Candidates for Baptism are the Catecheses I., II., pros
   tous mellontas photizesthai, delivered at Antioch by S. Chrysostom
   while a Presbyter.

   Another duty often undertaken by the Bishop was to hear each Candidate
   separately recite the Creed, and then to expound to them all the Lord's
   Prayer [80] .

   § 3.  Catechumens.  The term Catechumen denoted a person who was
   receiving instruction in the Christian religion with a view to being in
   due time baptized.  Such persons were either converts from Paganism and
   Judaism, or children of Christian parents whose Baptism had been
   deferred.  For though the practice of Infant-Baptism was certainly
   common in the Early Church [81] , it was not compulsory nor
   invariable.  "In many cases Christian parents may have shared and acted
   on the opinion expressed by Tertullian in the second century, and by
   Gregory Nazianzen in the fourth, and thought it well to defer the
   Baptism of children, cases of grave sickness excepted, till they were
   able to make answer in their own name to the interrogations of the
   baptismal rite [82] ."

   It is stated by Bingham [83] , but without any reference to ancient
   authors, that "the child of believing parents, as they were baptized in
   infancy, were admitted Catechumens as soon as they were capable of
   learning."  Though the title "Catechumen" was not usually applied to
   those who had been already baptized, it is probable that such children
   were admitted to the Lectures addressed to Catechumens both in the
   earlier and later stage of their preparation:  for it seems to be
   implied in the passage quoted above from Cat. xv. 18, that admission
   was not limited to the candidates for Baptism.

   To believe and to be baptized are the two essential conditions of
   membership in Christ's Church [84] :  but for the admission of new
   converts to the class of Catechumens nothing more could be required
   than evidence of a sincere desire to understand, to believe, and
   ultimately to be baptized.

   We know that unbelievers, Jews, and Heathens were allowed in the
   Apostolic age to be present at times in the Christian assemblies [85] ;
   and in Cyril's days they stood in the lower part of the Church
   (narthex) to hear the Psalms, Lessons, and Sermon [86] .

   Any persons who by thus hearing the word, or by other means, were
   brought to believe the truth of Christianity, and to wish for further
   instruction, were strictly examined as to their character, belief, and
   sincerity of purpose.  The care with which such examinations were
   conducted is thus described by Origen:  "The Christians, however,
   having previously, so far as possible, tested the souls of those who
   wish to become their hearers, and having previously admonished them in
   private, when they seem, before entering the community, to have made
   sufficient progress in the desire to lead a virtuous life, they then
   introduce them, having privately formed one class of those who are just
   beginners, and are being introduced, and have not yet received the mark
   of complete purification; and another of those who have manifested to
   the best of their ability the purpose of desiring no other things than
   are approved by Christians [87] ."  Such as were thus found worthy of
   admission were brought to the Bishop Presbyter, and received by the
   sign of the Cross [88] , with prayer and imposition of hands, to the
   status of Catechumens.

   We have a description by Eusebius [89] of some of these ceremonies in
   the case of Constantine:  When the Emperor felt his life to be drawing
   to a close, "he poured forth his supplications and confessions to God,
   kneeling on the pavement in the Church itself, in which he also now for
   the first time received the imposition of hands with prayer."  Soon
   after this the Bishops whom he had summoned to Nicomedia to give him
   Baptism, "performed the sacred ceremonies in the usual manner, and
   having given him the necessary instructions made him a partaker of the
   mystic ordinances."

   Another ceremony used in the admission of Catechumens, at least in some
   Churches, mentioned by S. Augustine [90] :  "Sanctification is not of
   one kind only:  for I suppose that Catechumens also are sanctified in a
   certain way of their own by the sign of Christ's Cross, and the Prayer
   of the Imposition of Hands; and that which they receive, though it be
   not the Body of Christ, is yet an holy thing, and more holy than the
   common food which sustains us, because it is a sacrament."  From this
   passage it has been inferred that consecrated bread (eulogiai, panis
   benedictus), taken out of the oblations provided for the Eucharist, was
   given to the Catechumens,--an opinion which seemed to have some support
   in the comparison between "that which the Catechumens receive," and
   "the food which sustains us."  But Bingham maintains [91] that S.
   Augustine here refers only to the symbolical use of salt, of which he
   says in his Confessions, I. xi., that while yet a boy he "used to be
   marked with the sign of His Cross, and seasoned with His salt."  The
   meaning of this so-called "Sacrament of the Catechumens" was that by
   the symbol of salt "they might learn to purge and cleanse their souls
   from sin."

   In the African Church in the time of S. Augustine it was customary to
   anoint the new convert with exorcised oil at the time of his admission,
   but in the Eastern Church there seems to have been no such anointing
   until immediately before Baptism.

   Persons who had been thus admitted to the class of Catechumens were
   usually regarded as Christians, but only in a lower degree, being still
   clearly distinguished from the Faithful.  "Ask a man, Art thou a
   Christian?  If he is a Pagan or a Jew, he answers, I am not.  But if he
   say, I am, you ask him further, Catechumen or Faithful?  If he answer,
   Catechumen, he has been anointed, but not yet baptized [92] ."
   Augustine, like Tertullian, complains that among heretics there was no
   sure distinction between the Catechumen and the Faithful [93] :  and
   according to the second General Council, Canon 7, converts from certain
   heresies to the orthodox Faith were to be received only as heathen:
   "On the first day we make them Christians, on the second Catechumens,
   on the third we exorcise them by three times breathing on them on the
   face and on the ears; and so we instruct them (katechoumen), and make
   them frequent the Church for a long time, and listen to the Holy
   Scriptures, and then we baptize them."

   Whether Cyril calls his hearers Christians before they had been
   baptized is not very clear:  in Cat. x. § 16, he seems to include them
   among those who are called by the "new name;" but in § 20 of the same
   Lecture he assumes that there may be present some one who "was before a
   believer (pistos)," and to him he says "Thou wert called a Christian;
   be tender of the name," and in Lect. xxi. i, speaking to those who had
   now been baptized, he says, "Having therefore become partakers of
   Christ, ye are properly called Christs.  Now ye have been made Christs
   by receiving the antitype of the Holy Ghost," that is, Chrism.

   § 4.  Candidates for Baptism.  Bingham, who himself makes four classes
   or degrees of Catechumens, acknowledges that "the Greek expositors of
   the ancient Canons," and other writers, "usually make but two sorts
   [94] ."  These were (1) the imperfect (atelesteroi), called also
   hearers (akroomenoi , audientes), because in Church they were only
   allowed to remain till the Holy Scriptures had been read, the Sermon
   preached, the special prayers of the Catechumens said, and the blessing
   given to each by the Bishop in the words of the "prayer of the
   imposition of hands [95] ."  After this the Deacon says, "Go out, ye
   catechumens, in peace."  (2)  After the Energumens also have been
   dismissed, the more perfect (teleioteroi, photizomenoi) remain on their
   knees in prayer (gonuklinontes, euchomenoi).  Then the Deacon is to cry
   aloud, "Ye that are to be illuminated, pray.  Let us the faithful all
   pray for them.  And being sealed to God through His Christ, let them
   bow down their heads, and receive the blessing from the Bishop."  The
   "Prayer of the Imposition of hands" is then pronounced over them by the
   Bishop.

   The period of probation and instruction varied at different times and
   places:  according to Canon 42 of the Synod of Elvira, 305, it was to
   be two years:  "He who has a good name, and wishes to become a
   Christian, must be a Catechumen two years:  then he maybe baptized [96]
   ."  After this probation had been satisfactorily passed, the
   Catechumens invited to give in their names as Candidates for Baptism.
   This invitation, described by Cyril as a call to military service
   (klesis strateias) [97] , appears to have been often repeated on the
   approach of Lent.  Thus S. Ambrose, in his Commentary on S. Luke, v. 5;
   We have toiled all night and have taken nothing, complains, "I too,
   Lord, know that for me it is night, when I have not Thy command.  No
   one yet has given his name:  with my voice I have cast the net
   throughout Epiphany, and as yet I have taken nothing."

   This preliminary "call to service" must be distinguished from the
   actual enlistment in the Christian army at Baptism, in anticipation of
   which Cyril prays for his hearers that God "may enlist them in His
   service, and put on them the armour of righteousness [98] ."  The same
   metaphorical language in reference to the Christian warfare recurs in
   many passages [99] .

   The next step for those who responded to the call was the registration
   of names (onomatographia ) [100] .  It appears from passages of
   Dionysius Pseudo-Areopagites, quoted by Bingham [101] , that the
   Bishop, after laying his hand on each Catechumen's head, commanded his
   Presbyters and Deacons to register his name, together with that of his
   sponsor (anadochos) in the Diptychs of the living.  This ceremony took
   place at Jerusalem at the beginning of Lent, as we learn from Procat. §
   1:  "Thou hast entered, been approved; thy name inscribed....A long
   notice is allowed thee; thou hast forty days for repentance."  Those
   who had been admitted as candidates for Baptism were in most Churches
   still reckoned among the Catechumens, being distinguished as
   sunaitountes , "competentes."  But from Cyril's language in several
   passages it appears that in the Church of Jerusalem they ceased to be
   regarded as Catechumens, and were reckoned among the Faithful.  "Thou
   wert called a Catechumen, while the word echoed round thee from
   without.  Think not that thou receivest a small thing:  though a
   miserable man, thou receivest one of God's titles.  Hear S. Paul
   saying, God is faithful.  But beware, lest thou have the title of
   faithful,' but the will of the faithless [102] ."  "Thou receivest a
   new name which thou hadst not before.  Heretofore thou wast a
   Catechumen, but now thou wilt be called a Believer (Pistos) [103] ."

   Again, "How great a dignity the Lord bestows on you in transferring you
   from the order of Catechumens to that of the Faithful, the Apostle Paul
   shews, when he affirms, God is faithful [104] ."

   Two passages in S. Cyril have been thought to imply that the
   newly-admitted Candidates for Baptism carried lighted torches in
   procession, perhaps on the first Sunday after the registration.  He
   speaks of their having received "torches of the bridal procession [105]
   ;" and on this expression the Benedictine Editor observes that "Wax
   tapers" were perhaps given to the Illuminandi to carry, a custom which
   may also be indicated in the words, "Ye who have lately lighted the
   torches of faith, guard them carefully in your hands unquenched [106]
   ."

   Others are of opinion that the custom of carrying torches or tapers was
   observed only in the procession of the newly-baptized from the
   Baptistery to the Church [107] , and that here Cyril means by the
   "bridal lamps," those motions of the Holy Ghost, and spiritual
   instructions, which had lighted their way to Christ, and to the
   entrance to His Kingdom [108] .  This latter interpretation is rather
   vague and far-fetched, and it is evident that the words, "Ye who have
   lately lighted the torches of faith," gain much in clearness and force,
   if suggested by the visible symbolism of a ceremony in which the
   Illuminandi had just borne their part.  The lighted torches would be a
   significant symbol both of the marriage of the soul with Christ, and of
   its enlightenment by faith.

   § 5.  photizomenoi.  In the first words of his Introductory Lecture
   Cyril addresses his hearers as hoi photizomenoi, "Ye who are being
   enlightened," and from the Titles of the Catechetical Lectures
   i.-xviii., we see that this name was constantly used to distinguish the
   candidates preparing for immediate Baptism.

   The Verb photizo is frequently used by the LXX., both in a physical and
   in a spiritual sense.  In the New Testament it is found but rarely in
   the physical sense [109] , being generally applied to the light of
   spiritual truth, and to Christ as its source [110] .

   In two passages of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Aorist
   (photisthentas ) marks "the decisive moment when the light was
   apprehended in its glory [111] ," from which the thought easily passes
   on to the public profession of the truth thus received, that is, to
   Baptism.

   That the word began very early to be used in this new sense, is evident
   from Justin Martyr's explanation of it in his First Apology, c. 61;
   where, after speaking of instruction in Christian doctrine, of the
   profession of faith, and the promise of repentance and holy living, as
   the necessary preparations for Baptism, he thus proceeds:  "And this
   washing is called Illumination (sotismos), because they who learn these
   things are illuminated in their understanding. [112] "  The same
   transition of the meaning from instruction to Baptism is clearly
   implied by Clement of Alexandria:  "Among the barbarian philosophers
   also to instruct and to enlighten is called to regenerate [113] ," and
   again:  "For this reason the teaching, which made manifest the hidden
   things, has been called illumination (photismos) [114] ."

   That this is the sense in which Cyril uses the word is placed beyond
   doubt by a passage of the Lecture delivered immediately before the
   administration of Baptism:  "that your soul being previously
   illuminated (prophotizomenes ) by the word of doctrine, ye may in each
   particular discover the greatness of the gifts bestowed on you by God
   [115] ."

   We thus see that the Present Participle (photizomenoi) describes a
   process of gradual illumination during the course of instruction, to be
   completed in Baptism, a sense which is well expressed in the Latin
   Gerundive "Illuminandi."  And as we have seen that the candidates are
   addressed as hoi photizomenoi even before the course of instruction has
   commenced, the quasi-Future sense "follows necessarily from the context
   [116] ."

   The spiritual "Illumination," of which Baptism was to be the completion
   and the seal, thus became by a natural development one of the
   recognised names of Baptism itself.  On the contrary, the inverse
   process assumed by the Benedictine Editor is entirely unnatural.
   Starting from the later ecclesiastical use of photizo and photismos as
   connoting Baptism, he supposes that this was the first application of
   those terms, and that they were transferred to the previous
   illumination acquired by instruction in Christian truth, only because
   this was a necessary preparation for Baptism.  He therefore maintains
   that photizomenoi throughout the Catechetical Lectures is another term
   for baptizomenoi:  and as a decisive proof of this he refers to Cat.
   xvi. 26:  mellei de kai epi se ton baptizomenon phthanein he charis,
   not observing that the grace is to come upon "the person being
   baptized" at a time still future.  This meaning of the passage is made
   absolutely certain by the words which immediately follow,--"But in what
   manner I say not, for I will not anticipate the proper season."  We may
   conclude, therefore, that in Cyril's Lectures the term hoi photizomenoi
   refers to the preparatory course of enlightenment rather than to
   Baptism.  At the same time we must remember that in Cyril's day, and
   long before, photizo, photismos, and photisma were constantly used to
   denote Baptism itself, as being the time of special illumination by the
   grace of the Holy Spirit then given.  Thus Clement of Alexandria
   writes:  "In Baptism we are illuminated....This work is variously
   called grace, and illumination (photisma), and perfection, and
   washing:...illumination, by which that holy light of salvation is
   beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly [117] ."  Gregory
   Nazianzen speaks in the same way:  "We call it gift, grace, baptism,
   chrism, illumination, garment of incorruption, washing of regeneration,
   seal, all that is precious [118] ."

   Chapter III.--Special Preparation for Baptism.

   § 1.  Penitence.  The candidate for Baptism, having been duly admitted
   and registered, was required not only to be diligent in attending the
   course of Catechetical instruction [119] , but also to enter at once
   upon a course of strict devotion and penitential discipline.  "Those
   who are coming to Baptism," says Tertullian, "must be constantly
   engaged in prayers, fastings, kneelings, and watchings, together with
   confession of all past faults [120] ."

   On these subjects Cyril's teaching is earnest, wise, and sympathetic:
   he seeks to lead to repentance by gentle persuasion, and pleads for
   self-discipline as needful for the good of the soul [121] .  One whole
   Lecture is devoted to the necessity of thorough repentance for all past
   sins, and forgiveness of all offences [122] :  another to the sure
   efficacy of repentance for the remission of sins [123] .

   § 2.  Confession.  'Exomologesis.  Great stress is laid by Cyril on the
   necessity not only of sincere inward repentance, but also of open
   confession.  The words exomologeisthai, exomologesis have a twofold
   meaning and a wide application.

   (1.)  In the Septuagint they occur very frequently, especially in the
   Psalms, in the sense of "giving thanks or praise" (Heb. hdvh) [124] , a
   meaning which is also found in the New Testament [125] .  Perhaps the
   earliest instance in an Ecclesiastical writer is in Hermas, Mandat. X.
   iii. 2:  exomologoumenos to theo.  I have not found any instance of
   this meaning in Cyril.

   S. Chrysostom, commenting on the words, "I will give thanks unto Thee,
   O Lord [126] ," says, "There are two kinds of exomologesis; for it is
   either a condemnation of our own sins or a giving of thanks to God."
   The link between these two ideas is seen in Joshua's exhortation to
   Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel,
   and make confession [127] unto Him.  R.V. Margin.  Or, give praise.

   (2.)  In the sense of "confessing" sins, the Verb is not uncommon in
   the N.T. [128] , and in the early Fathers [129] .  Tertullian adopts
   the Greek word, and calls exomologesis "the handmaid of repentance
   [130] ," adding that it will extinguish the fire of Gehenna in the
   heart, being a second remedy for sin, after Baptism.

   Again, speaking of the outward act of repentance, he says:  "This act,
   which is more usually expressed and commonly spoken of under a Greek
   name, is exomologesis, whereby we confess our sins to the Lord, not
   indeed as if He were ignorant of them, but inasmuch as by confession
   satisfaction is appointed, and of confession repentance is born, and
   God appeared by repentance.  Accordingly exomologesis is a discipline
   for man's prostration and humiliation, enjoining a demeanour calculated
   to move mercy.  With regard also to the very dress and food, it
   commands (the penitent) to lie in sackcloth and ashes...to know no food
   and drink but such as is plain,--to feed prayers on fastings, to groan,
   to weep and roar (mugire) unto the Lord God; to roll before the feet of
   the presbyters, and kneel to God's dear ones, to enjoin on all the
   brethren embassies of intercession on his behalf.  All this
   exomologesis does, that it may enhance repentance [131] , &c."

   In this highly rhetorical description of the ecclesiastical discipline
   so dear to Tertullian there are many features of extreme severity to
   which Cyril makes no allusion; yet he frequently and very earnestly
   insists on the necessity and the efficacy of confession.  "The present
   is the season of confession:  confess what thou hast done in word or in
   deed, by night or by day; confess in an acceptable time, and in the day
   of salvation receive the heavenly treasure [132] "  "Tell the Physician
   thine ailment:  say thou also, like David, I said, I will confess me my
   sin unto the Lord ; and the same shall be done in thy case, which he
   says forthwith, and Thou forgavest the wickedness of my heart [133] ."
   " Seest thou the humility of the king?  Seest thou his
   confession?....The deed was quickly done, and straightway the Prophet
   appeared as accuser, and the offender confessed his fault; and because
   he candidly confessed, he received a most speedy cure [134] ."

   "Ezekias prevailed to the cancelling of God's decree, and cannot Jesus
   grant remission of sins?  Turn and bewail thyself, shut thy door, and
   pray to be forgiven, pray that He may remove from thee the burning
   flames.  For confession has power to quench even fire, power to tame
   even lions [135] ."

   The confession to which Cyril attaches so high a value, whether made in
   the privacy of solitude, or openly before the Ministers of the Church
   and the Congregation, is a confession to God, and not to man.  "Having
   therefore, brethren, many examples of those who have sinned and
   repented and been saved, do ye also heartily make confession unto the
   Lord [136] ."  Elsewhere he expressly disclaims the necessity of
   private confession to man:  "Not that thou shouldest shew thy
   conscience to me, for thou art not to be judged of man's judgment; but
   that thou shew the sincerity of thy faith to God, who trieth the reins
   and hearts, and knoweth the thoughts of men [137] ."  He also limits
   the season of confession and repentance to this present life:
   "Therefore the just shall then offer praise; but they who have died in
   sins have no further season for confession [138] ."

   § 3.  Exorcism.  One of the earliest ceremonies, after the registration
   of names, was Exorcism, which seems to have been often repeated during
   the Candidate's course of preparation.  "Receive with earnestness the
   exorcisms:  whether thou be breathed upon or exorcised, the act is to
   thee salvation [139] ."

   The power of casting out devils, promised by our Lord [140] , and
   exercised by Apostles [141] , and by Philip the Deacon and Evangelist
   [142] , was long regarded in the early Church as a direct gift still
   bestowed by the Holy Ghost, apart from any human ordinance.  Justin
   Martyr [143] , Tertullian [144] , Origen [145] , all speak of exorcism
   as being practised by laymen, even by soldiers, and women, by means of
   prayer and invocation of the name of Jesus.  Accordingly "an Exorcist
   is not ordained, for it is a gift of the spontaneous benevolence and
   grace of God through Christ by visitation of the Holy Ghost.  For he
   who has received the gift of healing is declared by revelation from
   God, the grace which is in him being manifest to all [146] ."  When the
   extraordinary gift was found to have been withdrawn, exorcists are
   mentioned among the inferior officers of the Church, after readers and
   subdeacons [147] .  From an early period certain set formulæ, such as
   the Divine names, "The God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of
   Jacob," "The God of Israel," "The God who drowned the king of Egypt and
   the Egyptians in the Red Sea," were frequently invoked against demons
   and certain wicked persons [148] .

   Accordingly, when an exorcist was ordained the Bishop was directed to
   give him the book in which the exorcisms were written, with the words,
   "Receive thou these, and commit them to memory, and have thou power to
   lay hands upon the Energumens, whether they be baptized or only
   Catechumens [149] ."  Though this Canon speaks only of exorcising
   Energumens, or such persons as were supposed to be possessed by evil
   spirits, we must remember that the power of such spirits was believed
   to extend to the whole world outside the Christian Church.  Thus all
   converts from Paganism and Judaism, and even the children of Christian
   parents were exorcised before being baptized.  The practice was closely
   connected with the doctrine of original sin, as we see in many passages
   of S. Augustine, and is declared by him to be very ancient and
   universal [150] .  In expounding the Creed to candidates for Baptism,
   he says:  "Therefore, as you have seen this day, and as you know, even
   little children are breathed on and exorcised, that the hostile power
   of the devil may be driven out of them, which deceived one man in order
   that he might get possession of all men [151] ."

   We find accordingly that Cyril enforces the duty of attending the
   Exorcisms on all the candidates alike, and from his use of the Plural
   (Exorcisms) we see that the ceremony was often repeated for each
   person.  Thus in the Clementine Homilies Peter is represented as
   saying, "Whoever of you wish to be baptized, begin from to-morrow to
   fast, and each day have hands laid upon you [152] ," the imposition of
   hands being one of the ceremonies used in exorcism [153] .  From
   expressions in the Introductory Lecture, "When ye have come in before
   the hour of the exorcisms [154] ," and again, "when your exorcism has
   been done, until the others who are to be exorcised have come [155] ,"
   it seems that before each Catechizing the candidates were all
   exorcised, one by one [156] , and that the earlier, after returning
   from their own exorcism, had to wait for those who came later.  The
   catechizing was thus frequently delayed till late in the day, and Cyril
   often complains of the shortness of the time left at his disposal [157]
   .

   At Antioch, the Catechizing preceded the Exorcism, as we learn from S.
   Chrysostom:  "After you have heard our instruction, they take off your
   sandals, and unclothe you, and send you on naked and barefoot, with
   your tunic only, to the utterances of the Exorcists [158] ."  Cyril
   says nothing of this unclothing, but mentions another ceremony as
   practised at Jerusalem:  "Thy face has been veiled, that thy mind may
   henceforward be free, lest the eye by roving make the heart rove also.
   But when thine eyes are veiled, thine ears are not hindered from
   receiving the means of salvation [159] ."  The veil may also have been
   a symbol of the slavery and darkness of sin, as S. Augustine regards
   the removal of the veil on the octave of Easter as symbolising the
   spiritual liberty of the baptized [160] .  Of this meaning Cyril makes
   no express mention.

   In the Greek Euchologion, as quoted by Kleopas, the act of the Exorcist
   is thus described:  "And the Priest breathes upon his mouth, his
   forehead, and his breast, saying, Drive forth from him every evil and
   unclean spirit, hidden and lurking in his heart, the spirit of error,
   the spirit of wickedness [161] , &c."

   Besides such invocations of the names of God, as we have mentioned
   above, the Exorcist used set forms of prayer "collected out of the Holy
   Scriptures."  Their effect, as described by Cyril, is to "set the soul,
   as it were, on fire," and scare the evil spirit away; and his meaning
   may be illustrated by a passage of Tertullian, who says [162] :  "All
   the authority and power we have over them is from naming the name of
   Christ, and recalling to their memory the woes with which God threatens
   them at the hands of Christ as Judge....So at our touch and breathing,
   overwhelmed by the thought of those judgment-fires, they leave the
   bodies they have entered, at our command, unwilling and distressed, and
   before your very eyes put to an open shame."

   The Exorcisms were performed in the Church; where also the Lectures
   were delivered, Catechumens of the lower order being excluded, "and the
   doors looking towards the city closed [163] , while those which looked
   towards the Holy Sepulchre, from which the ruins of the ancient Temple,
   Golgotha, and the old city could be seen, were left open [164] ."

   Chapter IV.--Ceremonies of Baptism and Chrism.

   § 1.  Renunciation.  We have seen that Cyril's last Catechetical
   Lecture was delivered in the early dawn of the Great Sabbath, Easter
   Eve.  The additional instructions then promised [165] concerning the
   behaviour of the Candidates were given on the same day, probably in the
   evening, when they were all assembled immediately before the
   administration of Baptism.  The most important parts of the Baptismal
   ceremony are described by Cyril in the first Mystagogic Lecture,
   delivered on the Monday of Easter week.  Thus in § 1 he says, Let us
   now teach you these things exactly, that ye may know the significance
   of the things done to you on that evening of your Baptism."

   The first act was the renunciation of the Devil and all his works.
   This, as described by Tertullian, was done first in the Church "under
   the hand of the Bishop," and again immediately before entering the
   water [166] .  Cyril speaks of the latter occasion only.  "First ye
   entered into the outer chamber of the Baptistery, and there facing
   towards the West (as the region of darkness) ye heard the command to
   stretch forth your hand, and as in the presence of Satan to renounce
   him [167] ."  For the formula of renunciation in the Apostolical
   Constitutions, see note 2 on Mystag. i. § 8; it corresponds closely
   with Cyril's, except that this is addressed to Satan as if personally
   present:  " I renounce thee, Satan [168] , and all thy works [169] ,
   and all thy pomp [170] , and all thy worship [171] ."

   § 2.  Profession of Faith.  After the renunciation of Satan the
   Candidate immediately turned to the East and said, "And I associate
   myself (suntassomai ) with Christ."  Cyril does not give the words, but
   seems to allude to the custom, when he speaks of the Candidates
   "turning from the West to the East, the place of light [172] ."

   Then, still facing the East, the Candidate was bidden to say, "I
   believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and in
   one Baptism of repentance [173] ."  We have seen that in Cat. xviii.
   22, 32, Cyril intimated to his Candidates that they would be required
   to profess publicly the Creed which he had delivered to them and which
   they had repeated after him.  This public profession of faith
   (Omologia, "Redditio Symboli") was in some Churches made on Holy
   Thursday, according to Canon 46 of the Synod of Laodicea:  "Those to be
   baptized must learn the Creed by heart, and recite it to the Bishop or
   Presbyters on the fifth day of the week."  But in the Apostolic
   Constitutions, c. xli., Candidate is required to recite the whole Creed
   immediately after the Renunciation:  "And after his renunciation let
   him in his consociation (suntassomenos) say:  And I associate myself to
   Christ, and believe and am baptized into One Unbegotten Being, the Only
   True God Almighty, the Father of Christ,....and into the Lord Jesus
   Christ....and I am baptized into the Holy Ghost,....into the
   resurrection of the flesh, and into the remission of sins, and into the
   kingdom of heaven, and into the life of the world to come.'  And after
   this vow he comes in order to the anointing with oil."

   Such appears to have been the custom of the Eastern Churches in general
   and of Jerusalem in Cyril's time, although he mentions only those
   articles of the Creed which were commonly held to be indispensable to a
   valid profession of Christian belief.

   Dr. Swainson [174] represents the matter somewhat differently:  "When
   we come to the profession of his own personal faith which was made at
   Jerusalem by the Candidate for Baptism, we find that this was far
   briefer not only than the collection of necessary things' (Cat. iv.),
   but also than the Creed of the Church of Jerusalem."  Then after
   quoting the short form in Cyril, Myst. i. § 9, "I believe in the
   Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and in one Baptism of
   repentance," Dr. Swainson adds:  "The words are clear and definite.  In
   these words each answered the question of which we read elsewhere, Did
   he believe in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
   Spirit?'  In this his reply the Candidate confessed' what Cyril called
   the saving confession.'"

   It is evident that two separate parts of the Baptismal Service are here
   confused:  the question to which Dr. Swainson alludes, and "the saving
   confession" of which Cyril speaks in Mystag. ii. § 4, belong, as we
   shall presently see, to a later stage of the ceremony.

   § 3.  First Unction.  On passing from the outer to the inner chamber of
   the Baptistery, the Candidate who had made his renunciation and
   profession barefoot and wearing his tunic (Chiton) [175] only, now put
   off this inner garment also, as an emblem of putting off the man with
   his deeds [176] .  A further significance is ascribed by Cyril to this
   unclothing of Candidate, as being an imitation both of Christ, who hung
   naked [177] on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from Himself the
   principalities and the powers, and "of the first-formed Adam, who was
   naked in the garden, and was not ashamed."

   "Then, when ye were stripped, ye were anointed with exorcised oil, from
   the very hairs your head to your feet [178] ."  The consecration of the
   "exorcised oil" is thus described [179] :  "Now this is blessed by the
   chief-priest for the remission of sins, and the first preparation for
   Baptism.  For he calls thus upon the Unbegotten God, the Father of
   Christ, the King of all sensible and intelligent natures, that He would
   sanctify the oil in the name of the Lord Jesus, and impart to it
   spiritual grace and efficacious strength, the remission of sins, and
   the first preparation for the confession of Baptism, that so the
   Candidate for Baptism, when he is anointed may be freed from all
   ungodliness, and may become worthy of initiation, according to the
   command of the Only-begotten."

   Bingham's observation, that Cyril describes this first unction as used
   "between the renunciation and the confession [180] " is not quite
   accurate:  in fact it came between two confessions, the one made, as we
   have seen, immediately after the renunciation in the outer chamber, the
   other at the very time of immersion.  Chrysostom [181] clearly
   distinguishes two Confessions, but places one before Baptism, and the
   other after:  "What can be more beautiful than the words by which we
   renounce the devil?  Or those by which we associate ourselves with
   Christ?  Than that confession which comes before the washing?  Or that
   which comes after the washing?"

   This first unction is not mentioned by Tertullian, nor in any genuine
   work of Justin Martyr, but in the Responsiones ad Orthodoxos, a work
   which though still early is regarded as certainly spurious, we find the
   question put, "Why are we first anointed with oil, and then, having
   performed the before-mentioned symbolic acts in the Laver, are
   afterwards sealed with the ointment, and do not regard this as done in
   opposition to what took place in our Lord's case, who was first
   anointed with ointment and then suffered [182] ?"  And in the answer it
   is stated that "We are anointed with the simple oil that we may be made
   Christs (Christoi), but with the ointment in remembrance of our Saviour
   Christ, who regarded the anointing with ointment as His burial, and
   called us to the fellowship of His own sufferings and glory, typically
   in the present life but truly in the life to come."

   Cyril attributes to this "exorcised oil" the same power as to Exorcism
   itself, "not only to burn and cleanse away the traces of sin, but also
   to chase away all the invisible powers of the evil one [183] ."

   According to the directions concerning this first unction in the
   Apostolical Constitutions [184] , the Bishop was first to anoint the
   head only, the anointing of the whole body being then completed by the
   Deacon or Deaconess.

   § 4.  Baptism.  After this anointing the Candidates were "led by the
   hand to the sacred pool of Holy Baptism [185] ."  This pool
   (kolumbethra) was supplied with water raised from the reservoirs, of
   which, as we shall see, the Bordeaux Pilgrim speaks in his description
   of the Basilica.

   As great multitudes both of men and women were baptized at the special
   seasons, the Baptisteries were large buildings outside the Church, such
   as the Baptistery of the Lateran, said to have been originally built by
   Constantine.  The font itself also was large enough for several persons
   to be baptized at the same time.  In some places the men were baptized
   first, and then the women:  in others different parts of the Baptistery
   were assigned to them, and curtains were hung across the Font itself
   [186] .

   The consecration of the water is not mentioned in the Didache or Justin
   Martyr; but Tertullian thus describes its effect:  "The waters after
   invocation of God acquire the sacramental power of sanctification; for
   immediately the Spirit comes down from heaven upon the waters, and
   rests upon them, sanctifying them from Himself, and they being thus
   sanctified imbibe a power of sanctifying [187] ."

   In the prayer of consecration given in the Apostolic Constitutions the
   Bishop is directed first to offer adoration and thanksgiving to the
   Father and Son, and then to call upon the Father and say:  "Look down
   from heaven, and sanctify this water, and give it grace and power, that
   so he that is to be baptized, according to the command of Thy Christ,
   may be crucified with Him, and may die with Him, and may be buried with
   Him, and may rise with Him to the adoption which is in Him, that he may
   be dead to sin, and live to righteousness [188] ."

   Cyril ascribes the like effect to the consecration of the water, as
   imparting to it a new power of holiness by "the invocation of the Holy
   Ghost, and of Christ, and of the Father [189] ."

   While standing in the water the Candidate made what Cyril calls "the
   saving confession [190] ."  The whole Creed having been already recited
   (Redditio Symboli) in the outer chamber immediately after the
   Renunciation, a short form was now employed containing only the
   necessary declaration of faith in the Holy Trinity, and in the Baptism
   of Repentance for the remission of sins.

   § 5.  Trine Immersion.  This short confession appears to have been made
   by way of question and answer thrice repeated.  "Thou wast asked, Dost
   thou believe in God the Father Almighty?  Thou saidst, I believe, and
   dippedst thyself, that is, wast buried.  Again thou wast asked, Dost
   thou believe in our Lord Jesus Christ and in His Cross?  Thou saidst, I
   believe, and dippedst thyself; therefore thou wast buried with Christ
   also:  for he who is buried with Christ, rises again with Christ.  A
   third time thou wast asked, Dost thou believe also in the Holy Ghost?
   Thou saidst, I believe, a third time thou dippedst thyself; that the
   threefold confession might absolve the manifold fault of thy former
   life [191] ."  But Cyril of Alexandria, as quoted by Bingham [192] ,
   "makes these answers not only to be a confession of the three Persons
   of the Trinity, but a triple confession of Christ; which implies a
   repetition of the Creed (the shortened form?) three times over."

   In which of these ways the threefold interrogation ("usitata et
   legitima verba interrogationis") was made at Jerusalem, is not quite
   certain from Cyril's words:  "Each was asked, Dost thou believe in the
   name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and ye made
   that saving confession, and went down thrice into the water [193] ."
   The Didaché [194] enjoins baptism simply into the names of the Three
   Persons of the Holy Trinity.  Justin Martyr [195] adds a few words only
   to the names "of God the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our
   Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit;" and Tertullian [196]
   observes that "Wherever there are three, that is, the Father, the Son,
   and the Holy Spirit, there is the Church, which is a body of three."
   The trine immersion had reference not only to the Trinity, but was also
   a symbol of the three days of our Saviour's burial [197] .  The use of
   the three Holy Names was made more strictly indispensable as heresies
   were multiplied:  thus the 49th Apostolic Canon, which, Hefele says,
   "must be reckoned among the most ancient Canons of the Church," orders
   that "If any Bishop or Presbyter does not baptize, according to the
   Lord's command, into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but into
   three Beings without beginning, or into three Sons, or three
   Comforters, he shall be deprived."

   We see here that the power of administering Baptism was not restricted
   to the Bishop:  and Cyril speaks of it as possessed by "Bishops, or
   Presbyters, or Deacons," assigning as the reason the great increase of
   believers, "for the grace is everywhere, in villages and in cities, on
   them of low as on them of high degree, on bondsmen and on freemen [198]
   ."

   Thus the rule of Ignatius [199] , that "it is not lawful either to
   baptize or to hold a love-feast apart from the Bishop (choris tou
   episkopou)," must be understood to mean "without the authority and
   permission of the Bishop."

   Of certain minor ceremonies connected with Baptism, such as the "Kiss
   of peace," and the taste of milk and honey administered to the neophyte
   [200] , no mention is made by Cyril.

   § 6.  Chrism.  The custom of anointing the baptized with consecrated
   ointment is regarded by Cyril as a sacramental act representing the
   anointing of Jesus by the Spirit at His Baptism.  "As the Holy Ghost in
   substance lighted on Him, like resting upon like, so, after you had
   come up from the pool of the sacred waters, there was given to you an
   unction the counterpart (to antitupon) of that wherewith He was
   anointed, and this is the Holy Ghost [201] ."  As "He was anointed with
   a spiritual oil of gladness, that is with the Holy Ghost, called oil of
   gladness, because He is the author of spiritual gladness, so ye were
   anointed with ointment, and made partakers and fellows of the Christ
   [202] ."  The ceremony was very ancient:  there is probably a reference
   to it in the words of Theophilus of Antioch [203] (c. a.d. 170):  "We
   are called Christians, because we are anointed with the oil of God."
   Tertullian, a little later, after speaking of Baptism, says:
   "Immediately on coming out of the Laver we are thoroughly anointed with
   a consecrated unction [204] ;" and again, "After that, the hand is laid
   upon us in benediction, invoking and inviting the Holy Ghost [205] ."
   In another passage [206] he mentions also the sign of the Cross:  "The
   flesh is washed, that the soul may be cleansed; the flesh is anointed
   that the soul may be consecrated, the flesh is signed [with the Cross]
   that the soul also may be guarded; the flesh is overshadowed by
   imposition of the hand, that the soul also may be illuminated by the
   Spirit."

   The consecration of the ointment is compared by Cyril to the
   consecration of the Eucharist; after the invocation of the Holy Ghost
   it is no longer simple or common ointment, but a gift (Charisma) of
   Christ, and by the presence of the Holy Ghost is able to impart of His
   Divine Nature.  And this ointment is symbolically applied to thy
   forehead, and thy other organs of sense [207] ."

   The ears, nostrils, and breast were each to be anointed, and Cyril
   explains the symbolical meaning in each case by appropriate passages of
   Scripture [208] .

   The consecration of the chrism could be performed by none but the
   Bishop, and he alone could anoint the forehead [209] , Presbyters being
   allowed to anoint the breast, but only with chrism received from the
   Bishop [210] .  The several ceremonies are thus explained in the
   Apostolical Constitutions [211] :  "This baptism is given into the
   death of Jesus:  the water is instead of the burial, and the oil
   instead of the Holy Ghost; the seal instead of the Cross; the ointment
   is the confirmation of the Confession [212] ."

   In like manner the chrism is explained again, "The ointment is the seal
   of the covenants [213] ," that is, both of God's promises, and of the
   Baptismal vows.

   The members to be anointed were not the same in all Churches, but
   everywhere the chief ceremony was the anointing of the forehead with
   the sign of the Cross.  This is what Cyril calls "the Royal Sign [214]
   ," and "the Royal Seal to be borne upon the forehead of Christ's
   soldiers [215] ," and again, "The Seal of the fellowship of the Holy
   Ghost [216] ."

   These last were probably the very words pronounced by the Bishop in
   making the sign of the Cross on the forehead, for by Canon 7 of the
   Second General Council at Antioch (381), converts from heretical sects
   were to be "sealed or anointed with the holy ointment on the forehead,
   eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears.  And in sealing them we say, The seal
   of the gift of the Holy Ghost.'"

   An additional prayer to be said by the Bishop is given in the
   Apostolical Constitutions [217] :  "O Lord God, the Unbegotten, who
   hast no Lord, who art Lord of all, who madest the odour of the
   knowledge of the Gospel to go forth among all nations, grant also now
   that this ointment may be efficacious upon him that is baptized
   (baptizomeno), that the sweet odour of thy Christ may remain firm and
   stable in him, and that having died with Him, he may arise and live
   with Him."

   The whole ceremony was called by the Greeks "Chrism," the "Unction"
   being regarded by them as the chief part.  In the Latin Church the name
   Confirmation is of later date, and indicates that greater importance
   was then attached to the "Laying on of Hands" with prayer.

   Another ceremony, not alluded to by Cyril, was the saying of the Lord's
   Prayer by the neophyte, standing up, and facing towards the East [218]
   , after which he was also to pray, "O God Almighty, the Father of Thy
   Christ, Thine Only-begotten Son, give me a body undefiled, a clean
   heart, a watchful mind, an unerring knowledge, the influence
   (epiphoitesin) of the Holy Ghost for attainment and full assurance of
   the truth, through Thy Christ, by whom be glory to Thee in the Holy
   Ghost for ever.  Amen."

   Chapter V.--Eucharistic Rites.  Liturgy.

   § 1.  First Communion.  When the rites of Baptism and Chrism were
   completed, the new-made Christians, clothed in white robes (Myst. iv.
   8), and bearing each a lighted taper in his hand, passed in procession
   from the Baptistery into the great "Church of the Resurrection."  The
   time was still night, as we gather from the allusion in Procat., § 15:
   "May God at length shew you that night, that darkness which shines like
   the day, concerning which it is said, darkness shall not be hidden from
   thee, and the night shall be light as the day."  As the newly-baptized
   entered the church, they were welcomed in the words of the 32nd Psalm.
   "Even now," says Cyril (Procat., § 15), "let your ears ring, as it
   were, with that glorious sound, when over your salvation the Angels
   shall chant, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
   sins are covered; when like stars of the Church you shall enter in,
   bright in the body and radiant in the soul."  During the chanting of
   the Psalm the neophytes seem to have stood in front of the raised bema'
   or sanctuary, as we learn from Cyril's eloquent contemporary, Gregory
   Nazianzen, Orat. XL. § 46:  "The station in which presently after
   Baptism thou wilt stand before the great sanctuary prefigures the glory
   from yonder heaven; the psalmody, with which thou wilt be welcomed, is
   a prelude of those heavenly hymns; the lamps, which thou wilt light,
   are a mystic sign of the procession of lights, with which bright and
   virgin souls shall go forth to meet the Bridegroom, with the lamps of
   faith burning brightly."

   From the Syriac "Treatise of Severus, formerly Patriarch of Alexandria
   (Antioch), concerning the rites of Baptism and of Holy Communion
   (Synaxis) as received among the Syrian Christians" (Resch, Agrapha, §
   12, p. 361); we learn that it was the custom "to lift up the
   newly-baptized to the altar, and after giving them the mysteries the
   Bishop (Sacerdos) crowned them with garlands."

   The white garments (Procat., § 2:  Mystag., iv. 88) were worn until the
   Octave of Easter, Low Sunday, Dominica in Albis (Bingham, XII. c. iv. §
   3).

   § 2.  The Liturgy.  In Cyril's last Lecture, Mystagogic V., he reminds
   his hearers of what they had witnessed at their first Communion on
   Easter-day, and thus gives a most valuable testimony to the prescribed
   form of administering the Holy Eucharist in the Eastern Church in the
   middle of the fourth century.

   Passing over all the preparatory portion of the Liturgy, he tells us
   first that the Deacon brings water to the Bishop or Priest (to hierei)
   and to the Presbyters who stand round the altar, that they may wash
   their hands in token of the need of purification from sin; a ceremony
   which evidently had reference to the words of the Psalmist, "I will
   wash mine hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O Lord
   [219] ."  In some Churches, perhaps also at Jerusalem, the words were
   actually chanted during the ablution [220] .

   "Then the Deacon cries aloud, Receive ye one another:  and let us
   salute (aspazometha ) one another."  In the Clementine Liturgy [221]
   the "Kiss of Peace" precedes the "Ablution."

   Sometimes these two sentences are combined:  "Salute ye one another
   with the holy kiss [222] ."  In the Liturgy of S. James there are two
   separate rubrics, one immediately after the dismissal of the
   Catechumens, "Take knowledge one of another," and a second after the
   Creed, "Let us embrace (agapesomen) one another with a holy kiss."

   "After this the Priest (hiereus) cries aloud, Lift up your hearts.
   Then ye answer, We lift them up unto the Lord [223] ."

   The meaning of this Preface, as explained by Cyril, is an exhortation
   by the Priest, or Bishop when present, and a promise by the people, to
   raise all their thoughts to God on high, in preparation for the great
   Thanksgiving to which they were further invited:  "Let us give thanks
   unto the Lord,"--"It is meet and right [224] ."

   Then follows a very brief summary of the Eucharistic Preface, and after
   that the Trisagion [225] , corresponding in part to the long
   Thanksgiving in the Apostolic Constitutions for all God's mercies in
   creation, providence, and redemption [226] .

   It is important to observe how S. Cyril in this and the following
   sections associates the people with the Priest, using throughout the
   Plural "We."  That this is intentional and significant, we may learn
   from a passage of S. Chrysostom [227] which is so interesting that we
   may be allowed to translate it at length:  "Sometimes moreover no
   difference is made between the Priest and those over whom he presides,
   as for example when we are to partake of the awful mysteries; for we
   are all alike deemed worthy of the same privileges:  not as in the Old
   Covenant some parts were eaten by the Priest, and others by the
   governed (ho archomenos), and it was not lawful for the people to share
   in what the Priest partook of.  It is not so now:  but one Body is set
   before all, and one Cup.  And in the prayers also one may see the laity
   contributing much.  For the prayers on behalf of the Energumens, and on
   behalf of those in Penitence are offered in common both by the Priest
   and by themselves; and all say one prayer, a prayer that is full of
   compassion.  Again, after we have excluded from the sacred precincts
   those who are unable to partake of the Holy Table, there is another
   prayer to be made, and we all alike lie prostrate on the floor, and all
   alike rise up.  When again we are to receive and give a kiss of peace,
   we all alike embrace each other.  Again even amid the most tremendous
   Mysteries the Priest prays over the people, and the people over the
   Priest:  for the formula, "With Thy Spirit," is nothing else than
   this.  The words of the Thanksgiving again are common:  for he does not
   give thanks alone, but also the whole people.  For having first got
   their answer, and they agreeing that It is meet and right so to do,' he
   then begins the thanksgiving.  And why wonder that the people sometimes
   speak with the Priest, when even with the very Cherubim and the Powers
   on high they send up those sacred hymns in common.  Now all this I have
   said in order that each of the common people (ton archomenon) also may
   be vigilant, that we may learn that we are all one Body, having only as
   much difference between one and another, as between members and
   members, and may not cast the whole work upon the Priests, but
   ourselves also care for the whole Church even as for a common Body."

   It is remarkable that in Cyril's account of the Eucharistic rites in
   this Lecture there is not the slightest reference to the words of
   Institution, though these hold so prominent a place before the
   Invocation both in the Clementine Liturgy and in the Liturgy of S.
   James.  But we cannot justly assume, from a mere omission in so brief a
   summary, that the Commemoration of the Institution had no place in the
   Liturgy then in use at Jerusalem.  It seems more probable that Cyril
   did not think it necessary, after his repeated references to the
   Institution in the preceding Lecture, to make further mention of a
   custom so well known as the recitation of Christ's own words in the
   course of the Prayer preceding the Invocation.  On the previous day he
   had quoted S. Paul's account of the Institution, with the remark,
   "Since then He Himself has declared and said of the Bread, This is My
   Body, who shall dare doubt any longer?  And since He has Himself
   affirmed and said, This is My Blood, who shall ever hesitate, saying
   that it is not His Blood [228] ?"  The like efficacy he again ascribes
   to "the Lord's declaration" concerning both the Bread and the Wine,
   that they are "the Body and Blood of Christ [229] ."

   In the Didaché, which gives the oldest elements of an Eucharistic
   Service, there is neither the Commemoration nor the Invocation, but
   only two short and simple forms of Thanksgiving "for the Holy Vine of
   David," and "for the broken Bread [230] ."

   Justin Martyr seems to imply that the consecration is effected by the
   Commemoration of Christ's own words in the Institution:  "We have been
   taught," he says, "that the food which is blessed by the prayer of the
   word which comes from Him (ten di' euches logou tou par autou
   eucharistetheisan trophen), and by which our blood and flesh are by
   transmutation nourished, is the Flesh and Blood of that Jesus who was
   made Flesh."  He gives no separate Invocation of the Holy Ghost, but
   this may have been supplied in the "praise and glory" or in the "prayer
   and thanksgivings" sent up "to the Father of all through the name of
   the Son and of the Holy Ghost [231] ."

   Irenæus is apparently the earliest writer who represents the Invocation
   of the Holy Ghost as the immediate act of consecration:  "We make an
   oblation to God of the bread and the cup of blessing, giving Him thanks
   for that He has commanded the earth to bring forth these fruits for our
   nourishment.  And then, having completed the oblation, we call forth
   (ekkaloumen ) the Holy Spirit, that He may exhibit this sacrifice, both
   the bread the Body of Christ, and the cup the Blood of Christ, in order
   that the partakers of these antitypes may obtain the remission of sins
   and life eternal [232] ."

   Mr. Hammond writes that, "By the Oriental Churches an Invocation of the
   Holy Spirit is considered necessary to complete the consecration.  In
   the three Oriental Families of Liturgies such an Invocation is
   invariably found shortly after the Words of Institution [233] ."

   It is in accordance with this statement that, we find Cyril so
   frequently declaring that the elements which before the Invocation are
   simple bread and wine, become after the Invocation the Body and Blood
   of Christ [234] .  In the first of the passages referred to below he
   speaks of "the Holy Invocation of the Adorable Trinity," in the others
   of the Holy Spirit only.

   Cyril next describes the Invocation as "completing the Spiritual
   Sacrifice, the bloodless Service," and then gives a summary of the
   "Great Intercession" as made "over that Sacrifice of the
   Propitiation."  The Intercession, as represented by Cyril, is not
   simply a prayer, but an offering of the Sacrifice [235] , and this is
   in accordance with the usual language of the Liturgies."  We offer to
   Thee, O Lord, on behalf also of Thy holy places, which Thou hast
   glorified by the Theophany of Thy Christ, and by the visitation of
   Thine All-Holy Spirit:  especially on behalf of glorious Sion, the
   Mother of all the Churches, and on behalf of Thy Holy Catholic and
   Apostolic Church throughout the whole world [236] ."  In the Liturgy of
   S. Chrysostom, as now commonly used in the Orthodox Eastern Church, we
   find the fuller phrase, "We offer unto Thee this reasonable Service on
   behalf of the world, on behalf of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic
   Church [237] ."

   In some particulars Cyril's summary agrees most nearly with the
   Clementine Liturgy, as, for example, in the prayer "for the King and
   those in authority, and for the whole army, that they may be at peace
   with us [238] ."  In others he follows the Liturgy of S. James, as in
   the intercession for "every Christian soul afflicted and distressed,
   that stands in need of Thy pity and succour [239] ."

   Cyril next describes the commemoration of departed Saints, and "of all
   who in past years have fallen asleep among us," that is, in the bosom
   of the Church, and states his belief "that it will be a very great
   benefit to the souls, for whom the supplication is put up while that
   holy and most awful Sacrifice is presented [240] ."  He refers to
   objections against this belief, and brings forward in defence of it a
   reason applicable only to sinners:  "When we offer," he says, "our
   supplications for those who have fallen asleep, though they be sinners,
   we offer up Christ sacrificed for our sins, propitiating our merciful
   God for them as well as for ourselves [241] ."  His language on this
   subject seems in fact to shew an advance in doctrine beyond the
   earliest Liturgies.  In those of S. James and S. Basil we find prayers
   that the offering may be acceptable as a propitiation "for the rest of
   the souls that have fallen asleep aforetime," and again, "that we may
   find mercy and grace with all the Saints who have ever been pleasing in
   Thy sight from generation to generation, forefathers, fathers,
   Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Teachers, holy
   men, and every righteous spirit made perfect in the faith of Thy
   Christ."

   There is nothing here, nor in the Clementine Liturgy, nor in that of S.
   Mark, corresponding to the purpose which Cyril ascribes to the
   commemoration, "that at their prayers and intercessions God would
   receive our petition."  In the Anaphora of S. Chrysostom contained in
   the later form of the Liturgy of Constantinople we find, apparently for
   the first time, this prayer added to the commemoration of all Saints,
   "at whose supplications look upon us, O God."

   There was much controversy on the subject of prayers for the dead in
   Cyril's time, and the objections which he notices were brought into
   prominence by Ærius, and rebuked by Epiphanius [242] .

   From the commemoration of the departed Cyril passes at once to the
   Lord's Prayer [243] , omitting the Preface which is found in the
   Liturgies of S. James and S. Mark.  In the Clementine Liturgy, contrary
   to general use, the Lord's Prayer is not said at all.  Cyril adds an
   exposition of each petition, and gives an unusual explanation of
   epiousios, for which see the footnote:  he also explains tou ponerou as
   referring to "the wicked one," following in this the Embolismus of S.
   James, "deliver us from the wicked one and from his works."

   "After this the Bishop says, Holy things for holy men [244] ."
   Chrysostom explains this as being both an invitation to the Faithful in
   general to communicate, and a warning to the unholy to withdraw.  "The
   Bishop, with loud voice and awe-inspiring cry, raising high his arm
   like a herald, and standing on high in sight of all, above that awful
   silence cries aloud, inviting some and repelling others, and doing this
   not with his hand, but with his tongue more clearly than with the
   hand.....For when he says, Holy things for the holy, he means this:
   Whosoever is not holy, let him not draw near [245] ."

   In regard to the doctrinal significance of the formula, Dr. Waterland's
   remarks should be consulted [246] .

   The response of the people to the "Sancta Sanctis" is given by Cyril
   [247] in accordance with the Liturgy of S. James and the Clementine:
   "One is Holy, One is the Lord, Jesus Christ:"  but he does not mention
   the "Gloria in excelsis" nor the "Hosanna," both of which follow here
   in the Clementine.

   "After this," says Cyril, "ye hear the chanter inviting you with a
   sacred melody to the Communion of the Holy Mysteries, and saying, O
   taste and see that the Lord is good [248] .  This agrees with the
   Clementine rubric:  "Let the 33rd Psalm be sung while all the rest are
   partaking."  In the Liturgy of S. James, while the Bishop is breaking
   the Bread and dipping in the Wine, the "Agnus Dei" and several Psalms
   were sung:  but of these there is no mention in the Clementine Liturgy
   or in Cyril.

   On Cyril's directions for receiving the Bread and the Cup with due
   reverence, see the footnotes on the passages [249] .

   His final injunction to remain for the prayer and thanksgiving is taken
   from that in the Clementine Liturgy:  "Having partaken of the precious
   Body and the precious Blood of Christ, let us give thanks to Him who
   hath counted us worthy to partake of His holy Mysteries."  The
   thanksgiving, benediction, concluding prayers, and dismissal, vary much
   in the different Liturgies.

   Chapter VI.--Effects of Baptism and of Chrism.

   § 1.  Baptism.  When we try to ascertain the exact relation between
   Baptism and the Unction or Chrism which immediately followed, we find
   that Cyril's teaching on the subject has been understood in very
   different senses.  By some he is thought to regard the Unction as being
   merely an accessory rite of the one great Sacrament of Baptism; to
   others he seems to draw a clear distinction between them, assigning to
   each its proper grace and efficacy.

   The former view is stated by the Oxford editor, Milles, in his note on
   the words:  "And in like manner to you also, after you had come up from
   the pool of the sacred waters, there was given an unction, a figure
   (antitupon ) of that with which Christ was anointed; and that is the
   Holy Ghost [250] ."  "It is evident," says Milles, "from his words
   here, that the Chrism of which Cyril treats in this Lecture is not to
   be referred to the Unction which is administered by the Romanists in
   Confirmation.  For every one sees that by Unction in this passage a
   ceremony of Baptism is indicated.  The ancients employed two Unctions
   in Baptism, the first before the immersion in the water, of which he
   spoke in the preceding Lecture; the second immediately upon ascending
   from the water, of which he speaks in this Lecture."

   This opinion is elaborately discussed by the Benedictine editor,
   Touttée, Dissertatio iii. c. 7, who argues that the Unction described
   by Cyril is a Sacrament distinct from Baptism, that it has for its
   proper grace the gift of the Holy Spirit, and further that this gift is
   not conferred in Baptism.  Of these assertions the first and second
   appear to represent Cyril's view correctly:  the last is an
   exaggeration and a mistake, the tendency of which is to identify the
   Chrism of the Eastern Church with that which is used in Confirmation by
   the Roman Church, and to exalt the rite of Confirmation as a proper
   Sacrament distinct from Baptism, and even superior to it.  A view
   differing in some respects from both of these has been recently put
   forward by a learned and devout writer of our own Church, who has fully
   discussed the teaching of Cyril and other Eastern Fathers, and gives
   the result of his investigation in the following "Summary [251] :"
   "For very many centuries the Christians of the East have never been
   forced to define to themselves at all clearly the position of a person
   baptized but unconfirmed.  Their mode of administering Confirmation
   (Chrism?) by the hands of the baptizing Presbyter--though among the
   Greeks and some others with chrism prepared by the Bishop--relieves
   them from the necessity which weighs upon us Westerns, of teaching
   Christian children what their status is between the two rites.
   Confirmation (Chrism?) is for them, far more than it has been for a
   long while in the West, a factor in Baptism.  Only a more or less
   conscious desire not to fall behind Western teachers in honouring the
   perfecting Unction can have led their later authorities to treat that
   Unction as a sacrament numerically distinct from Baptism.  To all the
   early doctors of the East the two things are one, and Baptism
   culminates in the Unction.  The tendency among Oriental Christians was,
   not to attribute to Baptism in our modern sense the gift of the Holy
   Ghost, but rather to consider Baptism by itself as a bare rite,
   benefiting the body alone, and dependent for its spiritual efficacy
   upon other actions, after and before.  Not that this tendency has its
   full way.  The Greek Fathers may be said certainly on the whole to
   trace the forgiveness of sins, the preparatory cleansing, to the
   baptismal Laver; the gift of the Holy Ghost, for the ordinary purposes
   of Christian living, they trace, like S. Chrysostom, to that act which
   comes " immediately after Baptism, and before the Mysteries."

   When we come to inquire how far these several theories agree with the
   teaching of Cyril himself, we must in the outset put aside altogether
   the name Confirmation:  for as applied to the Unction used in the
   Eastern Church it is only confusing and misleading.  In the early ages
   of the Church Confirmation was not known even by name.  In the Latin
   Church "neither Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, nor
   any of the Latin Fathers, makes mention of Confirmation in this sense.
   Nor have the Greeks any word to answer to this Latin term [252] ."  So
   far, therefore, Milles appears to be perfectly right in refusing to
   connect the Chrism of which Cyril treats with the Unction used in
   Confirmation by the Roman Church.

   We may add that in Cyril's account of Chrism it is wholly unconnected
   with Confirmation, both in its symbolic reference and in its outward
   form.  Chrism, he says, is the antitype of the Unction of Christ by the
   Holy Ghost at His Baptism:  Confirmation is universally admitted to
   have been a following of the Apostles in their laying on of hands.  But
   in that Apostolic rite there was no unction, and in Chrism there was no
   such laying on of hands.

   In several passages Cyril clearly distinguishes the outward form of
   Baptism from the spiritual grace.

   "If thy body be here, but not thy mind, it profiteth thee nothing.
   Even Simon Magus once came to the Laver:  he was baptized, but was not
   enlightened; and though he dipped his body in water, he enlightened not
   his heart with the Spirit:  his body went down and came up, but his
   soul was not buried with Christ, nor raised with Him [253] ."

   It is impossible here to regard "the Spirit" as referring to the grace
   of Unction:  for (1) Baptism was not accompanied by Unction in the time
   of the Apostles, and (2) we should thus make a false antithesis between
   the outward part of the one rite ("he dipped his body in water"), and
   the inward part of the other.  Here, therefore, Cyril attributes
   enlightenment of the heart by the Spirit to Baptism apart from Unction,
   and at the same time lays stress upon the difference between the worthy
   and unworthy recipient of the outward form.

   The importance of this difference is further enforced throughout the
   next two sections, and at the close of § 4 the distinction between the
   outward sign and inward grace of Baptism, strictly so called, is again
   asserted, "though the water will receive thee, the Spirit will not
   accept thee."

   "Some might suppose," it is said, "from these words that Cyril thought
   of water and the Spirit as the sign and the thing signified in Baptism
   respectively, and a passage in a later Lecture upon the subject of the
   Sacrament (of Baptism) at first confirms that impression [254] ."

   To suppose that Cyril had any other thought in the former passage,
   seems to me impossible for any ordinary reader, and the later passage,
   not only at first, but more fully the longer it is considered, confirms
   that impression beyond all doubt.  The whole quotation, including Cat.
   iii. §§ 3, 4, is too long to repeat here, but may be read in its proper
   place.  It will be sufficient to give the passages which are of chief
   importance in the question before us, according to Canon Mason's
   translation.

   Cat. iii. § 3.  "Do not attend to the laver as mere water, but to the
   spiritual grace given along with the water"..."the mere water,
   receiving the invocation of the Holy Ghost, and of Christ, and of the
   Father, acquires a power of sanctity.  For since man is a two-fold
   being composed of soul and body, the cleansing element also is
   two-fold, the incorporeal for the incorporeal, the bodily for the
   body.  And the water cleanses the body, but the Spirit seals the soul,
   in order that having our hearts sprinkled by the Spirit, and our bodies
   washed with pure water, we may draw nigh to God.  When, therefore, you
   are about to go down into the water do not pay attention to the mere
   nature of the water, but expect salvation by the operation of the Holy
   Ghost.  For without both it is impossible for thee to be perfected."

   No words could state more clearly the distinction between the outward
   sign and the inward grace of Baptism, and the absolute necessity for
   both.  There is no possible reference to Unction, but "the operation of
   the Holy Ghost" in cleansing and sealing the soul is unmistakably
   connected with Baptism as "the grace given with the water" (meta tou
   hudatos), and below, as "the seal by water" (ten di' hudatos
   sphragida), the latter phrase shewing that Baptism by water is the
   signum efficax of the grace in question.

   Cyril then quotes our Lord's words, Except a man be born of water and
   the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, and explains them
   thus:  "On the one hand he who is being baptized (baptizomenos) with
   the water, but has not had the Spirit vouchsafed to him (kataxiotheis),
   has not the grace in perfection:  on the other hand, even if a man be
   distinguished for virtue in his deeds, but does not receive the seal
   bestowed by means of water (ten di' hudatos sphragida), he shall not
   enter into the kingdom of heaven."  Canon Mason, whose translation I
   have followed, finds here a reference both to Baptism and to Unction as
   "the first baptismal act and the second," and in support of this
   interpretation gives a second and more emphatic version:  "He who is in
   course of being baptized with the water, but has not yet had the Spirit
   vouchsafed to him, has not the grace in perfection."  This introduction
   of the word "yet," in order to represent a distinction between two
   separate acts, is not justified either by the reading of the older
   editions (oude to hudati baptizomenos me kataxiotheis de tou
   Pneumatos), nor by that of Codices Monac. Roe, Casaub. adopted by
   Reischl (oute ho bebaptismenos k.t.l.), nor by the Benedictine text
   (oute ho baptizomenos k.t.l.).  The obvious meaning of the passage,
   with either reading, is that "the man who in Baptism did not receive
   the Holy Spirit, has not the grace (of Baptism) complete."  The
   Benedictine Editor in his elaborate argument for regarding Chrism as a
   distinct sacrament [255] ", does not even refer to this passage.

   A statement which is important in this connexion is found in Mystag.
   ii. § 6:  "Let no one then suppose that Baptism is the grace of
   remission of sins only, or further of adoption, as the Baptism of John
   conferred only remission of sins; but as we know full well that it
   cleanses from sins and procures a gift of the Holy Spirit, so also it
   is a counterpart (antitupon) of the sufferings of Christ."

   Here besides "the remission of sins, which no man receiveth without the
   Holy Spirit [256] ," we find "a gift of the Holy Ghost," and the
   fellowship of Christ's Passion distinctly attributed to Baptism.

   If the "adoption" mentioned at the beginning of this passage were
   identical (as Touttée thinks) with the "gift of the Holy Ghost," it
   would by no means follow that Cyril here means to include Unction in
   Baptism.  For the grace which beyond all others is exclusively attached
   to Baptism, and not to Unction, is the new birth, and this is "the new
   birth into freedom and adoption [257] ."  In fact Cyril's teaching on
   this point is in strict accordance with that of St. Paul in Gal. iv.
   4-6, that we first receive the adoption of sons (huiothesian), and then
   "because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our
   hearts, crying, Abba, Father."  So again in Rom. viii. 15, 16, he says,
   "Ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  The
   Spirit Himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children
   of God."  In both passages St. Paul clearly distinguishes two things,
   "the adoption" itself, and the witness of it by "the Spirit of
   adoption."  Cf. Bengel on v. 4:  "Prius adoptionem, deinde Spiritum
   adoptionis accepimus;" and on v. 6:  "Filiorum statum sequitur
   inhabitatio Spiritus Sancti, non hanc ille."  The adoption itself
   belongs to Baptism strictly so called, in which we are made children of
   God and joint heirs with Christ (cf. Cat. iii. 15):  the witness of the
   indwelling Spirit of adoption is the special grace ascribed to Chrism
   in the Eastern Church, and to Confirmation in the Western.  There are
   many other passages in which Cyril ascribes to Baptism itself, as
   distinct from Chrism, a gift of the Spirit, such as the following:
   "But He trieth the soul:  He casteth not His pearls before the swine:
   if thou dissemble, men will baptize thee now, but the Spirit will not
   baptize thee [258] ."

   "The Lord, preventing us according to His loving-kindness, has granted
   repentance at Baptism, in order that we may cast off the chief--nay,
   rather the whole burden of our sins, and having received the seal by
   the Holy Ghost, may be made heirs of eternal life [259] ."

   Again, after speaking of "the invocation of grace having sealed the
   soul," he adds:  "Having gone down dead in sins, thou comest up
   quickened in righteousness.  For if thou hast been united with the
   likeness of the Saviour's death, thou shalt also be deemed worthy of
   His Resurrection [260] ."  The benefits ascribed to Baptism in these
   several passages without any allusion to Chrism, are brought together
   with rhetorical effect in the Introductory Lecture, § 16:  "Great is
   the Baptism that lies before you; a ransom to captives, a remission of
   offences, a death of sin, a new birth of the soul, a garment of light,
   a holy indissoluble seal, a chariot to heaven, the delight of Paradise,
   a welcome into the kingdom, the gift of adoption."

   From such language it is clear beyond question that in Cyril of
   Jerusalem, not to speak of other Oriental Fathers, the tendency is not
   "to consider Baptism by itself as a bare rite, benefiting the body
   alone, and dependent for its spiritual efficacy upon other actions
   after and before," but as depending on the power of the Holy Ghost, and
   the sincerity of repentance and faith in man.

   If further proof were needed, a glance at the Index under the word
   "Baptism" will shew the extraordinary richness, variety, and precision
   of Cyril's teaching, as to the gifts of the Holy Ghost conferred
   therein.

   § 2.  Chrism.  When spiritual blessings so many and so great have been
   ascribed to Baptism, in what light, it may be asked, does Cyril regard
   the Unction which follows?  Does he treat it as being merely an
   additional ceremony subordinate to Baptism, or as having for its own
   proper grace some special gift of the Holy Ghost?  We find no answer to
   this question in the earlier course of Lectures [261] .  But that
   Chrism was not regarded by Cyril as a mere accessory to Baptism, as
   Milles thought [262] , may be safely inferred from the fact that in
   announcing the subjects of his Mystagogic Lectures, he mentions first
   Baptism, then "the seal of the fellowship of the Holy Ghost," and then
   "the Mysteries at the altar of the New Covenant [263] :"  and this
   inference is fully confirmed by his language elsewhere:  "Ye have heard
   enough of Baptism, and Chrism, and partaking of the Body and Blood of
   Christ [264] ."  A mere additional ceremony of Baptism could not have
   been so independently placed between the two sacraments, and, as it
   were, in the same rank with them.

   The importance thus attached to Chrism is further shewn in the fact
   that Cyril uses the very same language in reference to the consecration
   of the ointment of Chrism and of the water of Baptism, and of the
   Eucharistic elements.  "The bread and wine of the Eucharist before the
   Invocation of the Holy and Adorable Trinity are simple (litos) bread
   and wine, but after the Invocation the Bread becomes the Body and the
   Wine the Blood of Christ [265] ."  Regard not the Laver as simple
   (lito) water, but rather regard the spiritual grace that is given with
   the water [266] ."  "The simple water having received the Invocation of
   the Holy Ghost, and of Christ, and of the Father, acquires a new power
   of holiness [267] ."

   "But see thou suppose not this to be plain (psilon) ointment.  For as
   the Bread of the Eucharist, after the Invocation of the Holy Ghost is
   no longer simple (litos) bread, but the Body of Christ; so also this
   holy ointment is no longer plain (psilon) ointment, nor, as one might
   say, common, after Invocation, but Christ's gift of grace (charisma),
   and is made effectual to impart the Holy Ghost by the presence of His
   own Godhead [268] ."

   The spiritual benefits which Cyril ascribes to the Unction are set
   forth in the same Lecture.  "This holy thing is a spiritual safeguard
   of the body, and salvation of the soul" (§ 7):  it sanctifies all the
   organs of sense:  "the body is anointed with the visible ointment, and
   the soul is sanctified by the Holy and Life-giving Spirit" (§ 3).
   After being anointed the Christian is now entitled to that name in its
   fullest sense [269] ; he is clothed with the whole armour of the Holy
   Ghost, that he may stand against the power of the adversary:  he may
   say, "I can do all things in Christ who strengtheneth me" (§ 4).

   In regard to the supposed identity of Chrism and Confirmation, it is
   important to notice carefully how Cyril speaks of the laying on of
   hands in the only passage where he mentions it [270] .

   He first illustrates the freedom of the Spirit, and His independence of
   human agency, by the gift of prophecy to the seventy elders, including
   Eldad and Medad:  he then refers to the gift of the spirit of wisdom to
   Joshua by the laying on of Moses' hands [271] , and adds, "Thou seest
   everywhere the figure (tupon) in the Old Testament, and in the New the
   same.  In Moses' time the Spirit was given by laying on of hands
   (cheirothesia ), and Peter gives the Spirit by laying on of hands [272]
   :  and upon thee also, who art to be baptized, the grace is about to
   come; but the manner (to pos) I tell thee not, for I do not forestall
   the time."

   From this passage it has been inferred (i) that Cyril alludes to a gift
   of the Spirit by laying on of hands in immediate connexion with Baptism
   and Unction [273] , and (2) that he refers this gift of the Spirit not
   to Baptism itself, but to the laying on of hands, or to the Unction as
   a figure that answers to it [274] .

   (1)  The first of these inferences is opposed to the fact that Cyril
   neither mentions the laying on of hands as part of the actual
   ceremonial in Baptism or Unction, nor as the analogous rite in the old
   Testament, but on the contrary expressly says [275] that the symbol (to
   sumbolon) of this holy Chrism in the Old Testament lies in the
   consecration of Aaron to be High Priest, when Moses, "after the washing
   in water anointed him, and he was called anointed,' evidently from this
   figurative unction (tou chrismatos delade tou tupikou)."

   (2)  In support of the second inference the argument offered is as
   follows:  "That the Spirit was to come upon them in the course of their
   Baptism is here again clearly stated; but that Cyril did not intend
   them to suppose that Baptism itself would convey the gift is equally
   clear.  Again and again in earlier Lectures, as well as in the words
   actually before us, Cyril has taught them to expect the gift in
   Baptism; if therefore the immersion itself were to be the means of
   receiving it, he has already told them his secret.  Yet now he says
   that he will not tell them how' they are to receive it.  That remains
   for a future occasion [276] ."  The mistake, as I venture to consider
   it, lies in the words which I have marked with italics.  For of the
   mysteries which were to be concealed from the unbaptized (amuetoi) the
   first was the manner of administering Baptism itself, and the second,
   the unction of Chrism; and in the preceding Lectures Cyril has no more
   told the secret of the one than of the other.  "Baptism, the Eucharist,
   and the oil of Chrism, were things that the uninitiated (amuetoi) were
   not allowed to look upon [277] ."

   "We bless," says S. Basil [278] , "both the water of Baptism and the
   oil of the Chrism, and moreover the baptized (baptizomenon) himself.
   From what written commands?  Is it not from a secret (siopomenes) and
   mystical tradition?  Again, the very anointing with the oil, what word
   of Scripture taught that?  And the dipping the man thrice, whence came
   it?  And all the other accompaniments of Baptism, the renunciation of
   Satan and his angels, from what Scripture came they?  Come they not
   from this unpublished and secret teaching, which our fathers guarded in
   a silence with which no prying curiosity might meddle, having been well
   taught to preserve the sanctity of the mysteries by silence?  For how
   could it have been right to publish in writing the doctrine of these
   mysteries, which the unbaptized are not even allowed to look upon?"

   As these secret ceremonies of Baptism and Unction are revealed by Cyril
   only in the Mystagogic Lectures, the supposed reason for saying, that
   in Cat. xvi. 26, the promised gift of the Spirit refers not to Baptism
   but only to Unction, at once falls to the ground.

   The true state of the case is well expressed by Bingham [279] , "Though
   the ancients acquainted the Catechumens with the doctrine of Baptism so
   far as to make them understand the spiritual nature and design of it,
   yet they never admitted them to the sight of the actual ceremony, nor
   so much as to hear any plain discourse about the manner of its
   administration, till they were fitted and prepared for the actual
   reception of it,"--or rather, till they actually received it.

   There is in fact no reason to exalt the benefits of Unction, or
   Confirmation, by robbing Baptism of its proper grace.  "It was this
   Unction, as the completion of Baptism, to which  they ascribed the
   power of making every Christian in some sense partaker of a royal
   priesthood.  To it they also ascribed the noble effects of confirming
   the soul with the strength of all spiritual graces on God's part, as
   well as the confirmation of the profession and covenant made on man's
   part [280] ."  We may well be satisfied that the doctrine of the early
   Church has been so fully retained in essential points in our own Office
   of Confirmation, recalling as it does by the ratification of the
   baptismal vows the immediate connexion of the ancient Unction with
   Baptism, and in its Prayers invoking the same gifts of the Holy
   Spirit,--"Strengthen them, we beseech Thee, O Lord, with the Holy Ghost
   the Comforter, and daily increase in them Thy manifold gifts of grace;
   the spirit of wisdom and understanding; the spirit of counsel and
   ghostly strength; the spirit of knowledge and true godliness, and fill
   them, O Lord, with the spirit of Thy holy fear, now and for ever.
   Amen."

   Chapter VII.--Eucharistic Doctrine.

   We have seen that Cyril makes the consecration of sacramental elements
   in every case consist in the Invocation of the Holy Ghost, after which
   the water of Baptism is no longer mere simple water [281] , the
   ointment no longer plain ointment [282] , the bread and the wine no
   longer plain bread and wine, but the Body and Blood of Christ [283] .

   Upon these statements an argument against Transubstantiation has been
   founded by Bishop Cosin [284] , and adopted both by Dr. Pusey [285] and
   Dean Goode [286] .  It being universally admitted that the substance of
   the water and of the ointment remains unchanged, it is argued from the
   identity of the language employed in each case that, according to
   Cyril, no substantial change takes place in the Bread and Wine.  Bishop
   Cosin quotes the following passage, of which the original is given
   below:  "Take heed thou dost not think that this is a mere ointment
   only.  For as the bread of the Eucharist after the invocation of the
   Holy Ghost is no longer ordinary bread, but is the body of Christ; so
   this holy ointment is no longer a bare common ointment after it is
   consecrated, but is the gift or grace of Christ, which, by His Divine
   Nature, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, is made efficacious; so that
   the body is anointed with the ointment, but the soul is sanctified by
   the holy and vivifying Spirit [287] ."

   Bishop Cosin proceeds to argue thus:  "Can anything more clear be
   said?  Either the ointment is transubstantiated by consecration into
   the spirit and grace of Christ, or the bread and wine are not
   transubstantiated by consecration into the Body and Blood of Christ.
   Therefore as the ointment retains still its substance, and yet is not
   called a mere or common ointment, but the Chrism or grace of Christ:
   so the bread and wine remaining so, as to their substance, yet are not
   said to be only bread and wine common and ordinary, but also the Body
   and Blood of Christ."

   Notwithstanding the great authority of Bishop Cosin, and the assent of
   Theologians of such opposite schools as Dr. Pusey and Dean Goode, it
   must be admitted that the argument, even as against Transubstantiation,
   is pressed beyond its just limits.  The identity of language extends
   only to two points, (1) the mode of consecration by Invocation, (2) the
   effect negatively stated, that the material element in each case is no
   longer simply a material element.  A change, therefore, of some kind
   has taken place, and we have still to inquire how the change in each
   case is described by Cyril.  "The water acquires a power of sanctity,"
   otherwise described as "the spiritual grace given with the water [288]
   ."

   "The ointment is Christ's gift of grace (Charisma), and becomes
   effectual to impart by the presence of the Holy Ghost His Divine Nature
   [289] ."  "The Bread becomes the Body and the Wine the Blood of Christ
   [290] ."

   There is here no such identity of language as would justify the
   assertion that the change described is of the same nature in each case,
   that because it leaves the substance of the water and the ointment
   untouched, therefore the substance of the Bread also must, according to
   Cyril, remain unchanged:  this must be proved by other arguments.  We
   must also remember that if this argument based upon the identity of the
   language used on the two sides of a comparison is trustworthy, there is
   another passage in Cyril to which it may be applied:  "He once, in Cana
   of Galilee, changed the water into wine akin to blood (oikeion haimati)
   [291] , and is it incredible that He changed wine into blood?"  The
   change of the water into wine was a change of substance:  are we then
   prepared to agree with the Roman Church that the change of the bread
   also is a change of substance?  Nay further, would the Roman Church
   itself accept the principle of the argument?  For observe that in fact
   Bishop Cosin himself, when he comes to deal with this passage, gives up
   his former argument, and distinctly rejects it.  "Protestants," he
   says, "do freely grant and firmly believe that the wine, in the sense
   already often mentioned, is changed into the Blood of Christ; but every
   change is not a transubstantiation; neither doth Cyril say that this
   change (i.e. of the wine) is like that of the water, for then it would
   appear to our senses; but that He who changed the water sensibly can
   also change the wine sacramentally, will not be doubted by any [292]
   ."  Again, in describing the act of consecration, Cyril says:  "We
   beseech the merciful God to send forth His Holy Spirit upon the gifts
   lying before Him, that He may make the bread the Body of Christ, and
   the wine the Blood of Christ, for certainly whatsoever the Holy Ghost
   has touched, is sanctified and changed (hegiastai kai metabebletai )
   [293] ."  Here again, as in the passage quoted from Myst. iii. § 3, a
   sacramental change of some sort is asserted, but its specific character
   is not defined.

   There is, however, a passage which throws some light on Cyril's
   conception of the change in Myst. iv. § 3:  "In the figure of Bread is
   given to thee His Body, and in the figure of Wine His Blood, that thou
   by partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ mightest be made of the
   same body and the same blood with Him.  For thus we come to bear Christ
   in us, His Body and His Blood being distributed to our members (eis ta
   hemetera anadidomenou mele)."  Several good MSS read anadedegmenoi,
   which would give the meaning, "having received of His Body and of His
   blood into our members."  This does not alter the general sense of the
   passage; but the reading anadidomenou is supported by another passage,
   Myst. v. § 15:  "Our common bread is not substantial (epiousios):  but
   this Holy Bread is substantial, that is, appointed for the substance of
   the soul.  This Bread goeth not into the belly and is not cast out into
   the draught, but is distributed (anadidotai) into thy whole system for
   the benefit of body and soul."

   In order to accommodate these passages to the Roman doctrine of
   Transubstantiation the Benedictine Editor here introduces the idea of
   species, the outward forms or accidents of the bread.  "We must not
   suppose," he says, "that Cyril thought the Body of Christ to be divided
   and digested (digeri) into our body; but by a customary way of speaking
   he attributes to the Holy Body what is suitable only to the species
   which conceal it.  And he does not deny that the species pass into the
   draught, but only that the Body of Christ does so."

   But Cyril draws no such distinction between the species and the Body of
   Christ:  to him the Bread and Wine after consecration are the Body and
   the Blood of Christ.  For how could it be said that the species, which
   in Transubstantiation are the mere outward accidents of bread and wine,
   are distributed into the whole system for the benefit of body and soul?

   In whatever sense the bread and wine become by consecration the Body
   and Blood of Christ, in that same sense the Body and Blood of Christ
   are, according to Cyril, distributed to our whole system.

   This was no new doctrine:  Ignatius, Ephes. xxi., speaks of Christians
   as "breaking one Bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and the
   antidote that we should not die, but live for ever in Jesus Christ."
   This is perhaps the earliest expression of the belief that the
   resurrection of the body is secured by the communion of the Body of
   Christ in the Eucharist.  The manner in which this communion is
   effected is described by Justin Martyr (Apolog. I. § 66) in language
   which shews clearly what Cyril meant:  "We do not receive these things
   as common bread and common drink:  but in the same way as Jesus Christ
   our Saviour was made flesh by the Word of God, and took both flesh and
   blood for our salvation, so we have been taught that the food over
   which thanksgiving has been made by prayer in the word received from
   Him (ten di' euches logou tou par' autou eucharistetheisan trophen),
   from which (food) our blood and flesh are by transmutation (kata
   metabolen) nourished, is both the Flesh and Blood of Him the Incarnate
   Jesus."

   Here it is plainly taught that by consecration the Bread and Wine have
   become the Flesh and Blood of Christ, and that as such they nourish our
   "blood and flesh" (observe the inverted order) by undergoing a change:
   in other words, the Eucharistic Body and Blood of Christ are changed
   into nourishment of our blood and flesh, by being distributed (as Cyril
   says) to all our members, that is by being subjected to the natural
   processes of digestion and assimilation.  The unusual order of the
   words "our blood and flesh" is not accidental, but answers to the
   process of assimilation, in which the digested food first nourishes the
   blood and then the blood nourishes the flesh.

   The meaning is, as Otto says in his note, "that the divine food passes
   away into our bodies entire, so that nothing remains:"  and Dr. Pusey
   seems to take the same view, in his note on the words, "from which
   (food) through transmutation our blood and flesh are nourished:  "i.e.
   the material parts are changed into the substance of the human body
   [294] ."

   Thus then, according to Cyril, the Eucharistic Body and Blood of Christ
   are distributed to all our members; His Flesh and Blood pass by a
   change into our blood and flesh, and we thereby become "of the same
   body and the same blood with Him [295] :"  and "this Bread does not
   pass into the belly, and is not cast out into the draught [296] ," but
   wastes away as the body itself wastes [297] .

   However much this view of the Sacramental mystery may differ from later
   theories, it was certainly held by many of the Greek Fathers.  Irenæus,
   for example, in addition to those already mentioned, thus writes:
   "When therefore both the mingled cup and the created bread receive the
   Word of God, and the Eucharist becomes the Body of Christ, and from
   these the substance of our flesh increaseth and consisteth, how say
   they that the flesh is incapable of the gift of God which is eternal
   life, that flesh which is nourished from the Body and Blood of the
   Lord, and is already (huparchousa) a member of Him?--even as the
   blessed Paul saith, that we are members of His Body, of His Flesh, and
   of His Bones [298] ."

   That this was also the teaching of Cyril's contemporaries is clear from
   the famous passage of Gregory of Nyssa, in which this doctrine is fully
   developed.  It will be sufficient to quote here the latter part of the
   passage, in which Gregory is speaking of the Wine.  "Since then that
   God-containing flesh partook for its substance and support of this
   particular nourishment also, and since the God who was manifested
   infused Himself into perishable humanity for this purpose, viz. that by
   this communion with Deity mankind might at the same time be deified,
   for this end it is that, by dispensation of His grace, He disseminates
   Himself in every believer through that flesh whose substance comes from
   bread and wine, blending Himself with the bodies of believers, to
   secure that, by this union with the immortal, man too may be a sharer
   in incorruption.  He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction
   through which He transelements the natural quality of these visible
   things to that immortal thing [299] ."

   In another remarkable passage [300] Cyril gives a further explanation
   of the effect of consecration:  "In the New Testament there is heavenly
   Bread and a Cup of salvation, sanctifying soul and body:  for as the
   Bread corresponds to the body, so also the Word (ho logos) is
   appropriate to the soul."  With this language of Cyril we may compare
   further what is said by Gregory of Nyssa in the context of the passage
   already quoted:  "Just then, as in the case of ourselves, as has been
   repeatedly said already, if a person sees bread he also in a kind of
   way looks on a human body, for by being within this it becomes this, so
   in that other case the Body into which God entered (to theodochon
   soma), by partaking of the nourishment of bread was in a certain sense
   the same with it, since that nourishment, as we have said, is changed
   into the nature of the body:  for that which is proper to all men is
   acknowledged also in the case of That Flesh, namely, that That Body too
   was maintained by bread; which Body also by the indwelling of God the
   Word was changed into the dignity of Godhead.  Rightly then do we
   believe that now also the bread which is sanctified by the Word of God
   is changed into the Body of God the Word.  For even that Body was once
   virtually (te dunamei) bread, but has been sanctified by the
   inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled in the flesh."

   In this passage we have the full explanation of what Irenæus meant when
   he said that the elements "by receiving the Word of God become the
   Eucharist," and what Cyril meant by saying that "as the Bread
   corresponds to the body, so also the Word is appropriate to the soul."
   Their common doctrine is, that besides the Body and Blood of Christ,
   that is, His Humanity offered upon the Cross for our redemption, His
   Divine Nature, the Word is also present, and that it is by receiving
   the Divine Word that the Bread is made the Body of Christ.  "The
   fathers," says Touttée, "often play upon the ambiguity of the term,
   saying at one time that the Divine Word, at another that the word and
   oracles of God nourish our soul.  Both are true.  For the whole
   life-giving power of the Eucharist is derived from the Divine Word
   united with the flesh which He assumed:  and the whole benefit
   (fructus) of Eucharistic eating consists in the union of our soul with
   the Word, by meditation on His mysteries and words, and conformation
   thereto [301] ."  O si sic omnia!

   In this view the Bread and Wine are signs or figures of the natural
   Body of Christ crucified, but they are also much more, they are endued
   by the Divine Word, and through the operation of the Holy Ghost, with
   the life-giving power of the same Body and Blood of Christ,--a power
   which being imparted to the faithful recipient makes him to be "of the
   same body and the same blood with Christ," thereby assuring him of the
   resurrection of the body to eternal life, and at the same time
   strengthening and refreshing the soul by its being united through faith
   with the Word, and being thus made "partaker of the Divine nature."

   This is not the language of the Western Church, whether Roman,
   Lutheran, or Anglican, but it is the language of the earliest Greek
   Fathers, and of Cyril, as is partly and reluctantly admitted by so
   cautious a writer as Dr. Waterland.  After referring to the passage
   quoted above from Justin Martyr (Apol. i. 66) he proceeds:  "There is
   another the like obscure hint in Irenæus, which may probably be best
   interpreted after the same way.  He supposes the elements to become
   Christ's body by receiving the word (Word).  He throws two
   considerations into one, and does not distinguish so accurately as
   Origen afterwards did between the symbolical food and the true food."
   The elements, Waterland adds, "are made the representative body of
   Christ; but they are at the same time, to worthy receivers, made the
   means of their spiritual union with Christ Himself; which Irenæus
   points at in what he says of the bread's receiving the Logos, but
   should rather have said it of the communicants themselves, as receiving
   the spiritual presence of Christ, in the worthy use of the sacred
   symbols [302] ."

   Again, in c. vii., he says more explicitly of Irenæus, what is equally
   true of Cyril; "Least of all does he favour the figurists or
   memorialists; for his doctrine runs directly counter to them almost in
   every line:  he asserts over and over, that Christ's body and blood are
   eaten and drunk in the Eucharist, and our bodies thereby fed; and not
   only so, but insured thereby for a happy resurrection:  and the reason
   he gives is, that our bodies are thereby made or continued members of
   Christ's body, flesh, and bones."

   From this view of Cyril's doctrine concerning the Sacramental elements
   we can easily understand in what sense he applies the terms " type" and
   "antitype" to the Eucharistic elements.  "The Sacrament of the Holy
   Eucharist having two parts, an outward and an inward, and the outward
   part having been instituted by our Blessed Lord with a certain relation
   to the inward, and gifted with a certain significance of it, nothing is
   more natural than that the titles, type, antitype, symbol, figure,
   image, should be given to the outward part [303] ."  Add to this that,
   according to Cyril's doctrine as already explained, the bread after the
   Invocation, without ceasing to be bread, not only signifies but also is
   the Body, and we see how natural it was for him to say in one passage
   that "His Body bore the figure of bread [304] ," in another that "in
   the figure of bread the Body is given [305] ."  The Body which "is
   given" cannot be an absent Body of our Lord, but must be that
   Sacramental Body, of which Cyril goes on to say in the same sentence
   that it is "distributed to our members."  Thus the Bread broken is a
   type or figure of Christ's Body as crucified for us; and by virtue of
   its union with the Divine Word it becomes the life-giving Body, which
   makes the faithful recipient to be, in Cyril's words, "of the same body
   and same blood with Christ."

   Another term applied by Cyril and other Greek Fathers to the
   sacramental elements is "antitype."

   In Mystag. ii. § 6, where Baptism is called "the counterpart
   (antitupon) of Christ's sufferings," the meaning is clearly explained
   by the context:  for in § 5 the reality of Christ's sufferings is
   emphatically and repeatedly contrasted with the figurative
   representation of the same; and this figurative representation no less
   emphatically contrasted with the real and actual bestowal of the grace
   of salvation:  en eikoni he mimesis, en aletheia de he soteria,....hina
   te mimesei ton pathematon autou koinonesantes, aletheia ten soterian
   kerdesomen.

   We have thus a clear distinction of (1) the res sacramenti,' Christ's
   Death and Resurrection, (2) the sacramentum' or sign,' the outward form
   of Baptism, and (3) the virtus sacramenti,' our real participation in
   the benefits of Christ's Passion, "a death unto sin, and a new birth
   unto righteousness."  Thus, as Cyril adds at the end of the section,
   Baptism "has the fellowship by representation of Christ's true
   sufferings," it is the spiritual counterpart in us of that which was
   actual in Him.

   In Mystag. iii. § i, speaking of the Chrism, Cyril says, "Now ye have
   been made Christs (Chrisoi) by receiving the antitype of the Holy
   Ghost, and all things have been wrought in you by imitation, because ye
   are images of Christ:"  and again, "there was given to you an Unction,
   the antitype of that wherewith Christ was anointed, and this is the
   Holy Ghost."

   Here again we have (1) the res sacramenti,' the anointing of Christ
   with the Holy Ghost at His Baptism, (2) the sacramental sign or figure,
   the anointing of the baptized, and (3) the spiritual benefit received
   in the gift of the Holy Ghost, for, as Cyril adds at the end of § 3,
   "while Thy body is anointed with the visible ointment, thy soul is
   sanctified by the Holy and Life-giving Spirit."  In these passages we
   see a distinction between tupos and antitupos.  The former is simply
   the outward sign or figure; the latter includes with the sign the
   spiritual counterpart in us of the thing signified, the benefits of
   Christ's Passion in the one case, the gift of the Holy Ghost in the
   other.

   It only remains to inquire whether there is the same distinction in the
   meaning of the words as applied to the Holy Eucharist.

   In Mystag. v. § 20, Cyril informs us that during the Administration the
   words, "O taste and see that the Lord is good," were sung:  and in
   reference to that passage he adds, "In tasting we are bidden to taste
   not bread and wine, but the antitypical Body and Blood of Christ."  To
   taste "the antitypical Body" is therefore to taste "that the Lord is
   good," whence it clearly follows that "the antitypical Body" is not the
   mere sign or figure of Christ's own natural Body, but the sacramental
   and spiritual counterpart of it, by which those who faithfully receive
   it are so united to Him, that their spirit, and soul, and body, are to
   be preserved entire without blame at His coming [306] .

   Chapter VIII.--Place of S. Cyril's Lectures.

   We have seen in a passage already quoted [307] that at Milan S. Ambrose
   expounded the Creed to Catechumens in the Baptistery.  But whatever may
   have been the custom in other places, it is certain from numerous
   passages in Cyril's Lectures that they were delivered in the great
   Basilica, or Church of the Resurrection, built by Constantine on the
   site of the Holy Sepulchre, and consecrated, as we have seen, with
   great splendour in the year 335 [308] .  In a passage [309] where Cyril
   is speaking of the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost,
   he says, "as we discourse on Christ and Golgotha here in Golgotha, so
   it were most fitting that we should also speak concerning the Holy
   Ghost in the Upper Church; yet since He who descended there jointly
   partakes of the glory of Him who was crucified here, we here speak
   concerning Him also who descended there."  It appears from a passage in
   the Introductory Lecture [310] that it was delivered in the Church
   itself before the whole congregation, after that portion of the daily
   Service to which Catechumens were usually admitted:  "Dost thou behold
   this venerable constitution of the Church?  Dost thou view her order
   and discipline, the reading of Scripture, the presence of the Ordained,
   the course of instruction?"  The same custom was retained in Jerusalem
   in the time of John, Cyril's successor in the Bishopric, who in writing
   to Jerome says, "The custom with us is that we deliver the doctrine of
   the Holy Trinity publicly during forty days to those who are to be
   baptized [311] ."

   The Mystagogic Lectures were delivered not in the Church, but after the
   conclusion of the public Service "in the Holy Place of the Resurrection
   itself [312] ," that is, in the small Chapel which contained the Holy
   Sepulchre, and to which the name "Anastasis" more properly belonged.
   Happily we are not required by the purpose of this work to enter into
   the disputed questions concerning the Holy Places.  Whether the cave
   re-fashioned and adorned by Constantine was the actual sepulchre in
   which our Lord's body was laid, and whether the present Churches occupy
   the same site as the Basilica and Anastasis of Constantine, are matters
   still under discussion, and awaiting the result of further researches.
   What more properly concerns us is to collect the chief passages in
   which Cyril refers to these localities, and to try to give a fair
   representation of his testimony, comparing it with that of earlier or
   contemporary writers.

   Next to Eusebius, and the Bordeaux Pilgrim who visited Jerusalem in
   333, Cyril is the earliest and most important witness as to the site of
   Constantine's Churches.

   In Cat. xiv. § 5, he says, "It was a garden where He was crucified.
   For though it has now been most highly adorned with royal gifts, yet
   formerly it was a garden, and the signs and the remnants of this
   remain."  From this it is evident that the traces of a garden close to
   the Church were still visible both to Cyril and his hearers.  Twice
   again in § 11 he mentions the garden, which he had most probably
   himself seen in its former state, before the ground was cleared at the
   time of the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre in 326.

   On this point it may be well to quote the words of Mr. Walter Besant,
   Honorary Secretary of the Palestine Exploration Fund, who, in an
   article on "The Holy Sepulchre" in the Dictionary of Christian
   Antiquities, writes as follows:  "While the temple of Venus with its
   foundations was being cleared away, there might have been, and most
   probably was present, a Christian lad, native of Jerusalem, eleven
   years of age, watching the discovery, which did as much as the great
   luminous cross which appeared in the sky four (? twenty-four) years
   later to confirm the doubtful and strengthen the faithful, that of the
   rock containing the sacred tomb.  It was Cyril, afterwards Bishop of
   Jerusalem.  One must not forget that he is the third eye-witness who
   speaks of these things; that though he was a boy at the time of the
   discovery, he lived in Jerusalem, and must have watched, step by step,
   the progress of the great Basilica; that he was ordained before the
   completion and dedication of the buildings, and that many, if not all,
   of his lectures were delivered in the Church of the Anastasis itself."

   That Cyril's testimony concerning the Holy Places was in full
   accordance with the general belief of his contemporaries is clear from
   the fact that he so frequently points to the traditional sites as
   bearing witness to the truth of the Crucifixion and Resurrection.  He
   speaks of Golgotha in eight separate passages, sometimes as near to the
   Church in which he and his hearers are assembled [313] , and sometimes
   as standing up above in their sight [314] .  In one place he asks,
   "Seest thou this spot of Golgotha?" and the hearers answer with a shout
   of approval [315] .  In other passages he speaks as if the Church
   itself was in or rather on Golgotha [316] , the same Preposition (en)
   being repeated when he mentions "Him who was crucified thereon."

   In explanation of these different modes of speaking, the Benedictine
   Editor comments thus [317] :  "The Church of the Resurrection was built
   on part of the hill Golgotha (intra montem G.):  but the actual rock on
   which our Lord was crucified was not within the limits of the Church,
   yet not far off, namely about "a stone's throw," as the author of the
   Jerusalem Itinerary says.  For the Church had been built on the site of
   the Sepulchre.  Some think that the place of Crucifixion was included
   in the vast area which was enclosed with colonnades between the
   Sepulchre and the Basilica,...that Golgotha was midway between the
   Basilica of the Crucifixion, and the Anastasis or Sepulchre.  But the
   area in question Constantine paved with stones, and it must therefore
   have been flat, as we learn from Eusebius [318] ; Golgotha, on the
   contrary, stood up high [319] , and moreover shewed a cleft made there
   at Christ's death [320] , which would either have been a hindrance to
   the paving or covered up by it.  In addition to this, from the doors of
   the Basilica there seems to have been a view of the Sacred Tomb [321]
   .  This would have been obstructed if Golgotha had been between them."

   The cleft in the rock of Golgotha is mentioned in a fragment of the
   defence made before Maximinus in 311 or 312 by Lucian the Martyr of
   Antioch [322] :  If yet you believe not, I will also offer you the
   testimony of the very spot on which the thing was done.  The place
   itself in Jerusalem vouches for these facts, and the rock of Golgotha
   broken asunder under the weight of the Cross:  that cave also, which
   when the gates of hell were burst, gave back the Body in newness of
   life."  On this passage Dr. Routh remarks that Maundrell, Journey from
   Aleppo to Jerusalem, at Easter, 1697, "shews that the rock had been
   rent not by any instrument, but by the force of an earthquake.  Also it
   is related by Eusebius in his Theophania, a book now recovered, that
   there was one cave only in this cleft of the rock."

   According to Eusebius in the passages of the Life of Constantine
   already referred to, the Emperor first beautified the monument or
   sepulchre with rare columns, then paved with finely polished stone a
   large area open to the sky, and enclosed on three sides with long
   colonnades, and lastly erected the Church itself "at the side opposite
   to the cave, which was the Eastern side."

   The following is the statement of the Bordeaux Pilgrim:  "From thence
   (the Palace of David) as you go out of the wall of Sion walking towards
   the gate of Neapolis, on the right side below in the valley are walls
   where the house or Prætorium of Pontius Pilate was:  here our Lord was
   tried before His Passion.  On the left hand is the little hill
   (monticulus) of Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified.  About a
   stone's throw from thence is a vault (crypta) wherein His body was
   laid, and rose again on the third day.  There by command of the Emperor
   Constantine has now been built a Basilica, that is to say, a Church of
   wondrous beauty, having at the side reservoirs (exceptoria) from which
   water is raised, and a bath behind in which infants are washed
   (baptized)."  Neapolis was the name given by Vespasian to the ancient
   city of Shechem, now Nâbulus:  the "porta Neapolitana" therefore was in
   the North wall of Sion.

   In reference to the passage quoted above, Mr. Aubrey Stewart says:
   "The narrative is clear and connected, and it is hardly possible, for
   any one who knows the ground, to read it without feeling that the
   Pilgrim from Bordeaux actually saw Constantine's buildings standing on
   the site now occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre [323] ."

   From these earlier testimonies, compared with the several passages
   already quoted from Cyril, we may safely draw the following inferences,
   (1) The Anastasis properly so called, or Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
   in which the five Mystagogic Lectures were delivered, was built by
   Constantine over the cave which, according to the evidence then
   existing, was fully believed to be the Burial-place of our Lord.  (2)
   The Great Basilica, called also the Church of the Holy Cross, in which
   the Catechetical Lectures were delivered, was erected on the East of
   the Anastasis, and separated from it by a large open area.  (3) The
   hill of Golgotha (on which at a later period there was built a third
   Church, called the Church of Golgotha, of Holy Calvary, or of Cranium)
   stood about a stone's throw on the North side of Constantine's two
   Churches, and about equidistant from them.

   Chapter IX.--The Time and Arrangement of S. Cyril's Lectures.

   § 1.  The Year.  The incidental notes of time in the Catechetical
   Lectures are sufficient to determine with considerable probability the
   exact year in which they were delivered.

   In Cat. xiv. 14, Cyril speaks in the Plural of the Emperors then
   reigning (hoi nun basileis) as having completed the building
   (exeirgasanto) and embellishment of the great Church of the
   Resurrection.  This can only apply to the sons of Constantine, Constans
   and Constantius, and as Constans died early in 350, the Lectures must
   have been delivered before that year.

   In Cat. xv. § 6, Cyril asks, "Is there at this time war between
   Persians and Romans, or no?"  The time thus indicated was apparently
   that of the campaign which ended in the disastrous defeat of
   Constantius at Singara, 348, the battle being soon followed by a
   suspension of hostilities [324] .

   The Benedictine Editor tries to find another proof of the date of the
   Lectures in Cyril's description of the state of the Church in Cat. xv.
   §7:  "If thou hear that Bishops advance against Bishops, and clergy
   against clergy, and laity against laity, even unto blood, be not
   troubled."  Touttée refers this account to the fierce dissensions which
   followed the Synod of Sardica, where Athanasius and Marcellus were
   declared innocent and received into communion, while the Encyclical of
   the dissentient Bishops, who had withdrawn to Philippopolis, condemned
   them both.  But it is now ascertained that the Synod of Sardica was
   held not in 347, as Touttée supposed, but in 344 [325] :  and Cyril's
   description may unhappily be applied to the state of the Church at
   almost any time from the Council of Tyre, by which Athanasius had been
   deposed in 335, until long after any date which can possibly be
   assigned to Cyril's Lectures.

   There is a much more definite note of time in Cat. vi. § 20, where
   speaking of Manes Cyril says:  "The delusion began full seventy years
   ago."  If we may assume that the outbreak of this heresy is to be dated
   from the famous disputation between Archelaus and Manes in 277 [326] ,
   it follows that Cyril must have made this statement in 347 or 348.  And
   further, if Dr. Routh [327] is correct in fixing the date of the
   Disputation between July and December 277, the Lent in which the
   Lectures were delivered must have been, as Touttée decides, that of
   348, not of 347, as Tillemont had supposed.

   § 2.  The days.  It is expressly stated by Sozomen [328] that "the
   interval called Quadragesima" was made to consist of six weeks in
   Palestine, "whereas it comprised seven weeks in Constantinople and the
   neighbouring provinces."

   It is certain the Catechetical Lectures i.-xviii. were all delivered in
   these six weeks, being preceded by the Procatechesis, which was
   addressed to the candidates before the whole congregation at the public
   Service on Sunday (§ 4).  In the same context Cyril says, "Thou hast
   forty days for repentance," and again in Cat i. § 5, "Hast thou not
   forty days to be free for thine own soul's sake?"  It thus appears
   probable that the first of the eighteen (Catechetical Lectures was
   delivered on the Monday of the first week of the Fast, the forty days
   being completed on the night preceding the Great Sabbath, that is to
   say, the night of Good Friday, when the fast was brought to an end at a
   late hour.

   With regard to the date of Cat. iv., which contains a brief preliminary
   statement of all the articles of the Creed, we may obtain some evidence
   from an incident recorded in a letter of Jerome [329] to Pammachius.
   John, who had then succeeded Cyril as Bishop of Jerusalem, had on a
   certain occasion discoursed on the Creed and all the doctrines of the
   Church in the presence of Epiphanius and the whole congregation.
   Jerome, being ignorant of the peculiar custom of the Church of
   Jerusalem, rebukes the supposed presumption of the Bishop, "that a man
   deficient in eloquence should in one discourse in Church discuss all
   the doctrines concerning the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Crucifixion,
   the descent into hell, the nature of angels, the state of departed
   souls, the Resurrection of Christ, and of ourselves, and other
   subjects."  The rebuke calls out a statement from John:  "The custom
   among us is that for forty days we publicly deliver the doctrine of the
   Holy and Adorable Trinity to those who are to be baptized."  This being
   the custom at Jerusalem in Cyril's time, we may conjecture that Cat.
   iv., which corresponds closely to the description of John's discourse,
   was delivered, like that, on a Sunday before the whole congregation:
   and this is in fact suggested by Cyril's own words in § 3:  "Let those
   here present, whose habit of mind is mature, and who have their senses
   already exercised to discern good and evil, endure patiently to listen
   to things fitted rather for children."  That this could not have been
   later than the Sunday following that on which the Procatechesis was
   delivered, is shewn by the mention in the same section of "the long
   interval of the days of all this holy Quadragesima," an expression
   which could not well have been used later than the second Sunday in
   Lent.

   In Cat. iv. § 32, Cyril speaks of having discoursed on Baptism "the day
   before yesterday," that is, on the Friday.

   In Cat. v. we have first a discourse on the nature of faith, and then
   towards the end, between § 12 and § 13, the actual words of the Creed
   are for the first time recited by Cyril to the candidates alone.  In
   the next four Lectures there are no marks of time, except that vi.,
   vii., viii., were delivered on successive days, as is proved by the
   word "yesterday"(te chthes hemera) in vii. § 1, and viii. § 1.  It thus
   appears probable that the five Lectures, v.-ix., belong to the five
   days, Monday to Friday inclusive, of the second or third week.

   In Cat. x. § 14 Cyril reminds his hearers that he had preached on the
   words after the order of Melchizedek at the public Service on the
   Lord's day.  As he does not here employ his usual phrase "yesterday,"
   we may infer that Cat. x. was delivered not earlier than the Tuesday
   following the 4th Sunday in Lent, the Epistle for that Sunday in the
   Eastern Church being Heb. vi. 13-20, which ends with the words on which
   Cyril had preached.  The next two Lectures followed Cat. x. immediately
   on successive days, Wednesday and Thursday, the word "yesterday"
   recurring in xi. § 1, and xii. § 4.

   Cat. xiii., which is occupied with the Crucifixion and Burial, seems to
   have followed them immediately on the Friday:  it certainly came a few
   days only before Cat. xiv. § 1.  For speaking there of the preceding
   Lecture, Cyril says, "I know the sorrow of Christ's friends in these
   past days; because, as our discourse stopped short at the Death and the
   Burial, and did not tell the good tidings of the Resurrection, your
   mind was in suspense to hear what you were longing for."  Now we know
   that Cat. xiv. was delivered on the Monday after Passion Sunday:  for
   the Epistle for that 5th Sunday in Lent was Heb. vi. 11-14, referring
   to the Ascension [330] :  and in § 24 Cyril says, "The grace of God so
   ordered it, that thou heardest most fully concerning it, so far as our
   weakness allowed, yesterday on the Lord's day, since by the providence
   of divine grace the course of the Readings (anagnosmaton) in Church
   included the account of our Saviour's going up into the heavens."

   In Cat. xv. there is no note of time to determine on what day it was
   spoken; but in § 33 Cyril speaks as if his course of teaching was to be
   interrupted for a little while:  "If the grace of God should permit us,
   the remaining Articles also of the Faith shall be in good time (kata
   kairon) declared to you."  We may therefore assign Cat. xv. to the
   early part of Passion week, and the three remaining Catechetical
   Lectures to the week before Easter.  This arrangement seems to be
   confirmed by Cat. xvii. 34, where Cyril speaks of the two Lectures on
   the Holy Spirit, xvi. and xvii., as "these present Lectures,"
   distinguishing them from "our previous discourses."  In the same
   section he refers to "the fewness of the days," and in § 20 speaks of
   "the holy festival of the Passover" as being close at hand.  We may
   therefore probably assign xvi. and xvii. to two consecutive days in the
   earlier part of the week before Easter.

   Cat. xviii. contains many indications from which we may conclude with
   certainty that it was delivered either on the night of Good Friday, or
   in the early hours of the morning of the "Great Sabbath."  Thus in § 17
   he speaks of "the weariness caused by the prolongation (hupertheseos)
   of the fast of the Preparation (Friday), and the watching."  In § 21 he
   calls upon the Candidates to recite the Creed, which he had dictated to
   them, and which they would be required to repeat more publicly
   immediately before their Baptism, as we learn from § 32:  "Concerning
   the holy Apostolic Faith which has been delivered to you to profess
   (eis epangelian), we have spoken through the grace of the Lord as many
   Lectures as was possible in these past days of Lent....But now the holy
   day of the Passover is at hand, and ye, beloved in Christ, are to be
   enlightened by the washing of regeneration.  Ye shall therefore again
   be taught what is requisite if God so will; with how great devotion and
   order you must enter in when summoned, for what purpose each of the
   holy mysteries of Baptism is performed, and with what reverence and
   order you must go from Baptism to the holy altar of God, and enjoy its
   spiritual and heavenly mysteries."  The additional instructions here
   promised were to be given on the same day as the last Lecture, Cat.
   xviii, that is on Easter Eve immediately before Baptism.  For it was
   forbidden to reveal the mysteries of Baptism, Chrism, and the Holy
   Eucharist to the uninitiated, and yet it was necessary that the
   Candidates should not come wholly unprepared to perform what would be
   required of them.  The full explanation of the various ceremonies and
   of the doctrines implied in them was reserved for the Mystagogic
   Lectures, which were to be delivered on Easter Monday and the four
   following days, after the public Service, not in the great Basilica,
   but in the Holy Sepulchre itself.

   § 3.  Arrangement.  The Lectures of S. Cyril have a peculiar value as
   being the first and only complete example of the course of instruction
   given in the early centuries to Candidates seeking admission to the
   full privileges of the Christian Church.  "The Great Catechetical
   Oration" of Gregory of Nyssa is addressed not to the learner but to the
   teacher, in accordance with the opening statement of the Prologue, that
   "The presiding ministers of the mystery of godliness have need of a
   system in their instructions, in order that the Church may be
   replenished by the accession of such as should be saved, through the
   teaching of the word of Faith being brought home to the hearing of
   unbelievers."  As an instruction to the Catechist how he should refute
   the opponents of Christianity, it is an apologetic work rather than a
   Catechism.  S. Augustine's treatise De catechizandis rudibus is also
   addressed to the teacher, being an answer to Deogratias, a Deacon of
   Carthage, who on being appointed Catechist had written to Augustine for
   advice as to the best method of discharging the office.  S. Augustine's
   Sermons De traditione Symboli, and De redditione Symboli, are not a
   connected series, but single addresses to Catechumens consisting of
   brief comments on a few chief articles of the Creed.  Cyril's Lectures
   thus remain unique in character.

   After the Procatechesis, which is simply an introductory exhortation to
   the newly admitted Candidates, he devotes three Lectures to the need of
   a sincere purpose of mind, the efficacy of repentance, and the general
   nature and importance of Baptism.  The fourth Lecture gives "a short
   summary of necessary doctrines," stating with admirable clearness and
   brevity ten chief points of the Faith, and the arguments on each point,
   which are to be developed in the remaining Catechetical Lectures
   v.-xviii.  He thus traverses the whole ground of Theology as expressed
   in the Creed of Jerusalem, of which the exact language is given in the
   titles of the successive Lectures.  These instructions to the
   Illuminandi' (photizomenon) were followed on Easter-day by the
   administration of Baptism, Chrism, and Holy Communion:  and on the
   following days of Easter-week the ceremonies and doctrines proper to
   each of these Sacraments were explained in the five Lectures on the
   Mysteries (Mustagogiai) to the newly-baptized (pros tous
   Neophotistous).  These Mystagogic Lectures thus form a most important
   record of the Sacramental Rites and Doctrines of the Eastern Church in
   the fourth Century, the most critical period of Ecclesiastical History.

   Chapter X.--The Creed of Jerusalem:  Doctrine of the Holy Trinity.

   § 1.  The Creed.  The ancient Creed which was used by the Church of
   Jerusalem in the middle of the fourth Century, and which Cyril
   expounded in his Catechetical Lectures, was recited by him to the
   Catechumens at the end of the fifth Lecture, to be committed to memory,
   but not to be written out on paper (§ 12).  Accordingly it is not found
   in any of the MSS., but instead of it the Nicene Creed with the
   Anathema is there inserted in Codd. Roe, Casaub.  This could only have
   been added after Cyril's time, when the motives for secrecy had ceased.

   The Creed which Cyril really taught and expounded may be gathered from
   various passages in the Lectures themselves, and especially from the
   Titles prefixed to them.

   With the Creed of Jerusalem thus ascertained, it will be instructive to
   compare the Nicene formula, and for this purpose we print them in
   parallel columns.

   § 2.  Doctrine of the Holy Trinity.  "The doctrinal position of S.
   Cyril is admirably described, and his orthodoxy vindicated by Cardinal
   Newman in the following passage of his Preface to the Lectures in the
   Library of the Fathers.  "There is something very remarkable and even
   startling to the reader of S. Cyril, to find in a divine of his school
   such a perfect agreement, for instance as regards the doctrine of the
   Trinity, with those Fathers who in his age were more famous as
   champions of it.  Here is a writer, separated by whatsoever cause from
   what, speaking historically, may be called the Athanasian School,
   suspicious of its adherents, and suspected by them; yet he, when he
   comes to explain himself, expresses precisely the same doctrine as that
   of Athanasius or Gregory, while he merely abstains from the particular
   theological term in which the latter Fathers agreeably to the Nicene
   Council conveyed it.  Can we have a clearer proof that the difference
   of opinion between them was not one of ecclesiastical and traditionary
   doctrine, but of practical judgment? that the Fathers at Nicæa wisely
   considered that, under the circumstances, the word in question was the
   only symbol which would secure the Church against the insidious heresy
   which was assailing it, while S. Cyril, with Eusebius of Cæsarea,
   Meletius and others shrank from it, at least for a while, as if an
   addition to the Creed, or a word already taken into the service of an
   opposite heresy, and likely to introduce into the Church heretical
   notions?  Their judgment, which was erroneous, was their own; their
   faith was not theirs only, but shared with them by the whole Christian
   world [345] ."

   In regard to the doctrine of the Trinity in general the two great
   heresies which distracted the Church in S. Cyril's day were
   Sabellianism and Arianism, the one "confounding the Persons," the other
   "dividing the substance" of the indivisible Unity of the Godhead.  Both
   these opposite errors Cyril condemns with equal energy:  "Do thou
   neither separate the Son from the Father, nor by making a confusion
   believe in a Son-Fatherhood [346] ."  Again he says:  "Our hope is in
   Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost.  We preach not three Gods:  let the
   Marcionites be silenced; but with the Holy Ghost through One Son we
   preach One God.  The Faith is indivisible; the worship inseparable.  We
   neither separate the Holy Trinity, like some (that is the Arians); nor
   do we, as Sabellius, work confusion [347] ."  "He says not, I am the
   Father, but the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.  And again He
   said not, I and the Father am one, but, I and the Father are One, that
   we should neither separate them, nor make a confusion of Son-Father
   [348] ."

   In the sequel of this last passage Cyril proceeds to argue that this
   unity of the Father and the Son lies in their Nature, "since God begat
   God," in their Kingdom [349] , in their Will [350] , and in their joint
   Creation [351] , thus at each step rejecting some prominent heretical
   tenet.

   The question, however, of Cyril's orthodoxy depends especially upon his
   supposed opposition to the Creed of Nicæa, of which no evidence is
   alleged except his attendance at the Council of Seleucia, and the
   absence from his Lectures of the word homoousion.

   The purpose of Cyril's attendance at Seleucia was to appeal against his
   deposition by Acacius, and there is apparently no evidence of his
   having taken part in the doctrinal discussions, or signed the Creed of
   Antioch [352] .  What is certain is that Cyril's bitterest enemies who
   refused to sit with him in the Council were Acacius and his Arian
   allies, who expressly rejected both homoousios and homoiousios and
   "altogether denied the Nicene formula and censured the Council, while
   the others, who were the majority, accepted the whole proceedings of
   the Council, except that they complained of the word Co-essential,' as
   obscure, and so open to suspicion [353] ."  It thus appears that
   Cyril's friends at Seleucia were partly those who approved the word "
   Co-essential," and partly those of whom Athanasius speaks as "brothers,
   who mean what we mean, and dispute only about the word [354] ."  It
   needed in fact the profound insight of an Athanasius to foresee that in
   the end that word must triumph over all opposition, and be accepted by
   the Universal Church as the one true safeguard of the Christian Faith.
   Meanwhile it was the standard round which debate, and strife, and
   hatred, and persecution, were to rage for fifty years with unexampled
   fury.

   Was Cyril to be blamed, ought he not rather to be commended, for not
   introducing such a war-cry into the exposition of an ancient Creed, in
   which it had no place, the Creed of his own Church, the Mother of all
   the Churches, whose Faith he as a youthful Presbyter was commissioned
   to teach to the young Candidates for Baptism?

   But if we compare his doctrine with that of the Nicene formula, we
   shall find that, as Dr. Newman says, "His own writings are most exactly
   orthodox, though he does not in the Catechetical Lectures use the word
   homoousion [355] ."

   The first point to be noticed in the comparison is the use of the title
   "Son of God."  For this Eusebius in his Creed had substituted "Word of
   God."  Athanasius explains the significance of the change:  "Uniting
   the two titles, Scripture speaks of Son' in order to herald the natural
   and true offspring of His essence (ousias); and on the other hand that
   none may think of the offspring as human, in again indicating His
   essence it calls Him Word, and Wisdom, and Radiance, for from this we
   infer that the generation was impassible (apathes), and eternal, and
   becoming to God [356] ."

   Cyril is here in full accord with Athanasius:  in his Creed he found
   "Son of God," and in his exposition he states that the Father is "by
   nature and in truth Father of One only, the Only-begotten Son [357] :"
   "One they are because of the dignity pertaining to the Godhead, since
   God begat God [358] :"  "The Son then is Very God, having the Father in
   Himself, not changed into the Father [359] ."  When he says that the
   Son is in all things like (homoios en pasin) to Him who begat Him;
   begotten Life of Life, and Light of Light, Power of Power, God of God,
   and the characteristics of the Godhead are unchangeable (aparallaktoi )
   in the Son [360] ," he is using in all good faith the very words of the
   orthodox Bishops at Nicæa, "homoion te kai aparallakton auton kata
   panta to Patri [361] ."

   The further significance which Athanasius ascribes to the title
   "Logos," is also expressed fully and repeatedly by Cyril:  "Whenever
   thou hearest of God begetting, sink not down in thought to bodily
   things, nor think of a corruptible generation, lest thou be guilty of
   impiety [362] ."

   The "passionless generation," to which so much importance was attached
   at Nicæa and by Athanasius, is also asserted by Cyril when he says that
   God "became a Father not by passion (ou pathei Pater genomenos) [363]
   ."  The eternal generation is most emphatically declared again and
   again:  the Son, he says, "began not His existence in time, but was
   before all ages eternally and incomprehensibly begotten of the Father;
   the Wisdom, and the Power of God, and His Righteousness personally
   subsisting [364] :"  "Throughout His being (ex houper en), a being by
   eternal generation, He holds His royal dignity, and shares His Father's
   seat [365] ."  Believe that of One God there is One Only-begotten Son,
   who is before all ages God the Word; not the uttered word diffused into
   the air, nor to be likened to impersonal words; but the Word, the Son,
   Maker of all who partake of reason, the Word who heareth the father,
   and Himself speaketh [366] ."

   The importance of such language is better understood when we remember
   that Marcellus, "another head of the dragon lately sprung up in Galatia
   [367] ," entirely rejected the word "Begotten," as implying a
   beginning, and "contradicting the eternity of the Logos, so distinctly
   proclaimed by S. John."  An eternal generation, as stated by Athanasius
   and others, was to him unimaginable.  The Logos in His pre-existence
   was unbegotten, and could not be called Son, but only the Logos
   invested with human nature was Son of God and begotten [368] ."  These
   heretical opinions of Marcellus had been condemned in several Councils
   within a few years preceding Cyril's Lectures.

   The next supposed proof of Cyril's opposition to the Nicene doctrine is
   that he has not adopted in his Lectures the phrases "of the essence
   (ousias) of the Father," and "of one essence (homoousion) with the
   Father."  This omission is the chief ground of the reproaches cast upon
   the memory of Cyril by the writers of Ecclesiastical History; for this
   he was described by Jerome as an Arian, and by Rufinus as a waverer,
   while his formal acceptance of the terms used at Nicæa is called by
   Socrates and Sozomen an act of repentance.  By others he was denounced
   as 'Areianophron because he had addressed his letter to Constantius as
   "the most religious king," and never used the word homoousion in his
   Lectures.

   We shall be better able to estimate the justice of these reproaches, if
   we consider first the history of these words ousia and homoousios, and
   the reasons which Cyril may have had for not employing them in the
   instruction of youthful Candidates for Baptism.

   It is strange to find that seven hundred years before the great
   controversy at Nicæa on the introduction of the word Ousia into the
   Creed, it had been the war-cry of almost as fierce a conflict between
   rival schools of philosophy.

   "There appears," says Plato in the person of the Eleatic stranger, "to
   be a sort of war of the giants going on between them because of the
   dispute concerning ousia.  Some of them are dragging all things down
   from heaven and from the invisible to earth, grasping rocks and oaks in
   their hands; for of all such things they lay hold, in obstinately
   maintaining that what can be touched and handled alone has being
   (einai), because they define being' and body' as one; and if any one
   else says that what is not a body has being, they altogether despise
   him, and will hear of nothing but body....Therefore their opponents
   cautiously defend themselves from above out of some invisible world,
   mightily contending that certain intelligible and incorporeal ideas are
   the true essence (ousian) [369] ."

   It is apparently to this passage of Plato that Aristotle refers in
   describing the ambiguity of the word ousia [370] :  "Now Ousia seems to
   belong most manifestly to bodies:  wherefore animals and plants and
   their parts we say are ousiai, also natural bodies as fire and water
   and earth and all such things, and all either parts of these, or
   products either of parts or the whole, as the heaven and its parts,
   stars, moon, and sun.  But whether these are the only ousiai or there
   are others also, or none of these but others of a different kind, is a
   matter for inquiry.  Some think that the boundaries of bodies, as a
   surface, and a line and a point and a unit (monas), are ousiai, even
   more so than body and solid.  Further, one class of persons thinks that
   besides things sensible there is no ousia, and another that there are
   many things, and these more enduring (aidia), as Plato thinks that the
   ideas (eide) and the mathematical elements are two kinds of ousia, and
   that the ousia of sensible bodies is a third."

   In proceeding to define the term, Aristotle says that ousia is used in
   four senses if not more:  the essential nature (to ti en einai), the
   universal (to katholon) the genus, and a fourth the subject (to
   hupokeimenon).  Under, this fourth sense he proceeds to discuss the
   application of the term ousia to the matter, the form, and the
   resulting whole.  Without going further we may see that the use of the
   word in philosophy was full of difficulty and ambiguity.

   The ambiguity is thus expressed by Mr. Robertson [371] :  "We may look
   at a concrete term as denoting either this or that individual simply
   (tode ti), or as expressing its nature, and so as common to more
   individuals than one.  Now properly (protos) ousia is only appropriate
   to the former purpose.  But it may be employed in a secondary sense to
   designate the latter, in this sense species and genera are deuterai
   ousiai, the wider class being less truly ousiai than the former."
   Perhaps the earliest use of ousia in Christian writings is in Justin M.
   [372] , where he describes the Logos as "having been begotten from the
   Father, by His power and will, but not by abscission (apotomen), as if
   the ousia of the Father were divided, as all other things when divided
   and cut are no longer the same as before."  His example was fire, from
   which other fires are kindled, while it remains undiminished and
   unchanged.  According to Dr. Newman [373] , ousia here means
   "substance, or being."

   In Clement of Alexandria [374] , ousia means a "nature" common to many,
   for he speaks of the Gnostic Demiurge as creating an irrational soul
   homoousion with the soul of the beasts;" and again as implanting in man
   "something co-essential (homoousion) with himself, inasmuch as he is
   invisible and incorporeal; his essence (ousian) he called "the breath
   of life," but the thing formed (morphothen) became "a living soul,"
   which in the prophetic Scriptures he confesses himself to be.  Again in
   §42 of the same Fragment, according to the Valentinians, "the body of
   Jesus is co-essential (homoousion) with the Church."

   So Hippolytus [375] speaks of the Son Incarnate as being "at one and
   the same time Infinite God and finite Man, having the nature (ousian)
   of each in perfection:"  and again, "There has been effected a certain
   inexpressible and irrefragable union of the two (the Godhead and the
   Manhood) into one subsistence (hupostasin)."

   In Origen we find the two words ousia (essence, or substance) and
   hupostasis (individual subsistence) accurately distinguished.  Quoting
   the description of Wisdom, as being the breath (atmis) of the power of
   God, and pure effluence (aporroia) from the glory of the Almighty, and
   radiance (apaugasma) of the Eternal Light [376] ," he says that "Wisdom
   proceeding from Him is generated of the very substance of God," and
   adds that "these comparisons most manifestly shew that there is
   community of substance between Father and Son.  For an effluence
   appears to be homoousios, that is, of one substance with that body from
   which it is an effluence or vapour."

   On the other hand he writes, "We worship the Father of the Truth, and
   the Son who is the Truth, being in subsistence (te hupostasei) two
   [377] ."  On this passage Bishop Bull remarks:  "The words hupostasis
   and ousia in ancient times were variously used, at least by the
   Christians.  That is to say, sometimes hupostasis was taken by them for
   what we call ousia, and vice versa, ousia for what we call hupostasis:
   sometimes the ancients even before the Council of Nicæa used hupostasis
   for what we now call person' or subsistence [378] '."  This Bishop Bull
   presently explains again as "an individual thing subsisting by itself,
   which in rational beings is the same as person."

   For examples of these interchanges of meaning, we may notice that the
   Synod of Antioch (a.d. 269), in the Epistle addressed to Paul of
   Samosata before his deposition, speaking of the unity of Christ's
   Person, says that "He is one and the same in His ousia [379] ."  On
   this passage Routh remarks that "The words ousia and phusis are
   sometimes employed by the ancients for a personal subsistence (persona
   subsistente), as is plainly testified by Photius."

   In the earlier part [380] of the same Epistle the Son is described as
   "being before all ages, not in foreknowledge, but in essence and
   subsistence (en ousia kai hupostasei)."

   The confusion arising from the uncertainty in the use of these two
   words is well illustrated in the account which Athanasius [381] himself
   gives of this same Synod of Antioch:  "They who deposed the Samosatene,
   took Co-essential (homoousios) in a bodily sense, because Paul had
   attempted sophistry and said, Unless Christ has of man become God, it
   follows that He is Co-essential with the Father; and if so, of
   necessity there are three essences (ousiai), one the previous essence,
   and the other two from it;' and therefore guarding against this they
   said with good reason, that Christ was not Co-essential (homoousion)."
   Athanasius then explains on what grounds the Bishops at Nicæa
   "reasonably asserted on their part, that the Son was Co-essential."
   Athanasius himself states that, in giving this explanation of the
   rejection of ousion by the Bishops who condemned the Samosatene, he had
   not their Epistle before him [382] ; and his statement, that Paul used
   the term not to express his own view, but to refute that of the
   Bishops, is thought to be opposed to what Hilary says [383] , "Male
   homoousion Samosatenus confessus est:  sed numquid melius Ariani
   negaverunt?"

   That the statement of Athanasius himself is not free from difficulty is
   clear from the way in which so great a Theologian as Bishop Hefele
   endeavours to explain it:  "Athanasius says that Paul argued in this
   way:  If Christ is Omoousios with the Father, then three subsistences
   (ousiai) must be admitted--one first substance (the Father), and two
   more recent (the Son and the Spirit); that is to say, that the Divine
   Substance is separated into three parts [384] ."  The logical subtlety
   of Paul was better understood by Basil the Great [385] :  "For in truth
   they who met together about Paul of Samosata found fault with the
   phrase, as not being distinct; for they said that the word homoousios
   gave the idea of an ousia and of those derived from it, so that the
   title homoousion assigned the ousia separately to the subjects to which
   it was distributed:  and this notion has some reason in the case of
   copper and the coins made from it; but in the case of God the Father,
   and God the Son, there is no substance conceived to be antecedent and
   superior to both:  for to say and to think this surpasses all bounds of
   impiety."

   The confusion arising from the uncertainty in the use of these words
   had been the cause of strife throughout the Christian Church for more
   than twenty years before the date of Cyril's Lectures; and though it
   was declared at the Council of Alexandria (362) to be but a controversy
   about words [386] , it had long been and long afterwards continued to
   be a fruitful cause of dissension between men who, when forced to
   explain their meaning, were found to be in substantial agreement.  That
   Cyril abstained from introducing into his elementary teaching terms so
   provocative of dangerous controversy, is a reason for commendation, not
   for censure.  But if it is alleged that he denied or doubted or failed
   to assert the essential Godhead of the Son, the suspicion is unfounded
   and easily refuted.  To the many passages already quoted concerning the
   eternal generation of the Son, it will be enough to add one single
   sentence which ought to dispel all doubt of his orthodoxy.  "The
   Only-begotten Son, together with the Holy Ghost, is partaker of the
   Godhead of the Father (tes theotetos tes Patrikes koinonos)."  The word
   chosen by Cyril to express the Divine Essence (theotes) common to the
   three Persons of the Godhead is at least as appropriate as ousia.

   If we now look at the particular errors mentioned in the Anathema of
   the Nicene Council, we shall find that every one of them is earnestly
   condemned by Cyril.

   "Once He was not (En pote hote ouk en).  This famous Arian formula is
   expressly rejected in Cat. xi. § 17:  "Neither let us say, There was a
   time when the Son was not."  The eternity of the Son is asserted again
   and again, in reference, for instance, to His generation [387] , His
   Priesthood [388] , and His throne [389] .

   "Before His generation He was not" (prin gennethenai ouk en).  Compare
   with this Cyril's repeated assertions that "the Son is eternally
   begotten, by an inscrutable and incomprehensible generation [390] ,"
   "the Son of God before all ages, without beginning [391] ," that "time
   intervenes not in the generation of the Son from the Father [392] ."

   "He came to be from nothing" (ex ouk onton egeneto).  Cyril's language
   is emphatic:  "As I have often said, He did not bring forth the Son
   from non-existence (ek tou me ontos) into being, nor take the
   non-existent into Sonship [393] ."

   "That He is of other subsistence or essence" (ex heteras hupostaseos e
   ousias).  It is certain that Cyril has given no countenance to the
   error or errors condemned in this clause, but is in entire agreement
   with the Council.

   On the question whether upostasis and ousia have in this passage the
   same or different meanings, see Bull, Def. Fid. Nic. II. 9, 11, p. 314
   (Oxf. Ed.).  Athanasius expressly states that they are perfectly
   equivalent:  "Subsistence (hupostasis) is essence (ousia), and means
   nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence
   (huparxis)."  Basil distinguishes them, and is followed by Bishop Bull,
   whose opinion is controverted by Mr. Robertson in an Excursus on the
   meaning of the phrase, on p. 77 of his edition of Athanasius in this
   Series.  The student who desires to pursue the subject may consult in
   addition to the works just named, and the authorities therein
   mentioned, Dr. Newman's Arians of the Fourth Century, especially chap.
   v. sect. i. 3, and Appendix, note iv., on "the terms ousia and
   hupostasis as used in the early Church;" Mr. Robertson's Prolegomena,
   ch. ii. § 3 (2) (b); and the Rev. H. A. Wilson's Prolegomena to Gregory
   of Nyssa, ch. iv., in this Series.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XI.--S. Cyril's Writings.

   § 1.  List of Works.  Besides the Catechetical and Mystagogic Lectures
   translated in this volume, the extant works of S. Cyril include (1) the
   "Letter to the Emperor Constantius concerning the appearance at
   Jerusalem of a luminous Cross in the sky:"  (2) "The Homily on the
   Paralytic at the Pool of Bethesda:"  and (3) Fragments of Sermons on
   the Miracle of the water changed into wine, and on John xvi. 28, "I go
   to My Father."

   Another work attributed by some authorities to Cyril of Jerusalem and
   by others to Cyril of Alexandria is a Homily De Occursu Domini, that
   is, On the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, and the meeting with
   Symeon, called in the Greek Church he Upapante.

   The other Fragments and Letters mentioned in the Benedictine Edition
   have no claim to be considered genuine.

   § 2.  Authenticity of the Lectures.  The internal evidence of the time
   and place at which the Lectures were delivered has been already
   discussed in chapters viii. and ix., and proves beyond doubt that they
   must have been composed at Jerusalem in the middle of the fourth
   century.  At that date Cyril was the only person living in Jerusalem
   who is mentioned by the Ecclesiastical Historians as an author of
   Catechetical Lectures:  and S. Jerome, a younger contemporary of Cyril,
   expressly mentions the Lectures which Cyril had written in his youth.
   In fact their authenticity seems never to have been doubted before the
   seventeenth century, when it was attacked with more zeal than success
   by two French Protestant Theologians of strongly Calvinistic opinions,
   Andrew Rivet (Critic. Sacr. Lib. iii. cap. 8, Genev. 1640), and Edmund
   Aubertin (De Sacramento Eucharistiæ, Lib. ii. p. 422, Ed. Davent.,
   1654).  Their objections, which were reprinted at full length by Milles
   at the end of his Edition, were directed chiefly against the Mystagogic
   Lectures, and rested on dogmatic rather than on critical grounds.  The
   argument most worthy of notice was that in a MS. of the Library of
   Augsburg the Mystagogic Lectures were attributed to John, Bishop of
   Jerusalem.  This is admitted by Milles, who gives the title thus:
   Mustagogikai katecheseis pente 'Ioannou 'Episkopou Ierosolumon, peri
   baptismatos, chrismatos, somatos, kai haimatos Christou.

   I do not find this Codex Augustinus mentioned elsewhere by any of the
   Editors under that name:  but the Augsburg MSS. were removed to Munich
   in 1806, and in the older Munich MS. (Cod. Monac. i), the title of the
   first Mystagogic Lecture is Mustagogia prote 'Ioannou episkopou
   Ierosolumon.  Also in Codd. Monac. 2, Ottobon. there is added at the
   end of the Title, tou autou Kurillou kai 'Ioannou episkopou.  That
   John, Cyril's successor, did deliver Catechetical Lectures, we know
   from his own correspondence with Jerome:  and this very circumstance
   may account for his name having been associated with, or substituted
   for that of Cyril.

   To Rivet's objection Milles makes answer that if the mistakes of a
   transcriber or the stumbling of an ignorant Librarian (imperiti
   Librarii cæspitationes) have in one or two MSS. ascribed the Lectures
   to John or any one else, this cannot be set against the testimony of
   those who lived nearest to the time when the Lectures were composed, as
   Jerome and Theodoret.  Also the internal evidence proves that the
   Lectures could not have been delivered later than the middle of the
   fourth century, whereas John succeeded Cyril about 386.

   Moreover it is quite impossible to assign the two sets of Lectures to
   different authors.  In Cat. xviii. § 33 the author promises, as we have
   seen, that he will fully explain the Sacramental Mysteries in other
   Lectures to be given in Easter week, in the Holy Sepulchre itself, and
   describes the subject of each Lecture; to which description the
   Mystagogic Lectures correspond in all particulars.  Other promises of
   future explanations are given in Cat. xiii. § 19, and xvi. § 26, and
   fulfilled in Myst. iv. § 3, and ii. § 6, and iii. § i.  On the other
   hand the author of Myst. i. § 9, after quoting the words, "I believe in
   the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and in one Baptism
   of repentance," adds, "Of which things I spoke to thee at length in the
   former Lectures."

   By these and many other arguments drawn from internal evidence Touttée
   has shewn convincingly that all the Lectures must have had the same
   author, and that he could be no other than Cyril.

   § 3.  Early Testimony.  Under the title "Veterum Testimonia de S.
   Cyrillo Hierosolymitano ejusque Scriptis," Milles collected a large
   number of passages bearing on the life and writings of S. Cyril, of
   which it will be sufficient to quote a few which refer expressly to his
   Lectures.

   S. Jerome, in his Book of Illustrious Men, or Catalogue of
   Ecclesiastical Writers, composed at Bethlehem about six years after
   Cyril's death, writes in Chapter 112:  "Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem,
   having been often driven out from the Church, afterwards in the reign
   of Theodosius held his Bishopric undisturbed for eight years:  by whom
   there are Catechetical Lectures, which he composed in his youth."

   Theodoret, born six or seven years after the death of Cyril, in his
   Dialogues (p. 211 in this Series) gives the "Testimony of Cyril, Bishop
   of Jerusalem, from his fourth Catechetical Oration concerning the ten
   dogmas.  Of the birth from a virgin, "Believe thou this, &c."

   Theophanes (575 circ.) Chronographia, p. 34, Ed. Paris, 1655, defends
   the orthodoxy of Cyril, as follows:  "It was right to avoid the word
   homoousios, which at that time offended most persons, and through the
   objections of the adversaries deterred those who were to be baptized,
   and to explain clearly the co-essential doctrine by words of equivalent
   meaning:  which also the blessed Cyril has done, by expounding the
   Creed of Nicæa word for word, and proclaiming Him Very God of Very
   God."

   Gelasius, Pope 492, De duabus in Christo naturis, quotes as from
   Gregory Nazianzen the words of Cyril, Cat. iv. § 9:  Diplous en ho
   Christos, k.t.l.

   Leontius Byzantinus (610 circ.) Contra Nestor. et Eutychem, Lib. 1.
   quotes the same passage expressly as taken "From the 4th Catechetical
   Oration of Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem."

   Many other references to the Catecheses as the work of Cyril are given
   by Touttée, pp. 306-315.

   § 4.  Editions.  1.  Our earliest information concerning the Greek text
   and translations of S. Cyril's Lectures is derived from John Grodecq,
   Dean of Glogau in Bohemia.

   From his statement it appears that Jacob Uchanski, Archbishop of
   Gnessen and Primate of Poland, had obtained from Macedonia a version of
   the Catecheses in the Slavonic dialect, and had translated it into the
   Polish language some years before 1560.

   2.  In that year Grodecq himself published at Vienna an edition of the
   Mystagogic Lectures, thus described in the catalogue of the Imperial
   Library:--

   "S. Cyril's Mystagogic Lectures to the newly baptized, which now for
   the first time are edited in Greek and Latin together, that he who
   doubts the Latin may have recourse to the Greek, and he who does not
   understand Greek well may read the Latin, translated by John Grodecq."

   Nothing more is known of this edition:  Fabricius, Milles, Touttée, and
   Reischl, all say that they have been unable to find any trace of it.
   Uchanski about this time sent to Grodecq his Slavonic and Polish
   versions, in order that they might be compared with the Greek
   original.  The result according to Grodecq was that the fidelity of
   both versions was clearly shewn, and "there could not possibly remain
   any doubt that these Lectures of Cyril are perfectly genuine."

   Whether Uchanski's book was written or printed is unknown, as no trace
   of it has hitherto been found.

   3.  S. Cyrilli Hier. Catecheses ad Illuminandos et Mystagogicæ.
   Interpretatus est Joannes Grodecius.  Romæ 1564.  8°.

   Grodecq had come to Rome in the suite of Stanislaus Hosius, Cardinal
   Legate at the Council of Trent, who in the year 1562 had published in
   the Confession of Petricow the 4th and part of the 3rd Mystagogic
   Lectures from a Greek MS. belonging to Cardinal Sirlet.  From this MS.
   Grodecq made his Latin translation, using also the work of Uchanski
   before mentioned.  The preface is dated from Trent, on the 9th of July,
   1563.  The translation was published in the following year at Rome,
   Cologne, Antwerp, and Paris, and often elsewhere until superseded by
   the new Latin Version of Touttée in the Benedictine Edition.

   4.  In the same year, 1564, the Mystagogic Lectures and Catecheses iv.,
   vi., viii.-x., xv., xviii. were published at Paris by William Morel,
   the King's Printer, under the following title:--

   "S. Cyrilli Hier. Catecheses, id est institutiones ad res sacras, Græce
   editæ, ex bibliotheca Henrici Memmii, cum versione Latina.  Cura Guil.
   Morellii.  Paris.  G. Morel., 1564.  4° min."

   The Greek text depending on de Mesme's one MS., and that mutilated and
   faulty, is said by Touttée to have many faults and omissions, but to
   have been nevertheless very useful to him in correcting the text.  The
   MS. itself had entirely disappeared.  The Latin version, appended to
   the copy in the Royal (National) Library at Paris, but not always
   attached to the Greek, is said by Touttée to be a careful and elegant
   version, independent of Grodecq's.

   A copy of Morel's Edition which formerly belonged to Du Fresne,
   containing various readings in the margin from two other MSS., was lent
   to Touttée from the Library of S. Geneviève (Genovef.).

   Reischl describes the MS. as "Cod. Mesmianus (Montf. I. 185).  Sec.
   xi."

   5.  "S. Cyrilli H. Catecheses Græce et Latine ex interpretatione Joan.
   Grodecii nunc primum editæ, ex variis bibliothecis, præcipue Vaticana,
   studio et opera Joan. Prevotii. Paris. (Claude Morellus), 1608."  This
   was the first complete edition of the Greek text.  Prevot, a native of
   Bordeaux, states in the Dedication to Pope Paul V., that by the help of
   MSS. "melioris notæ" found in the Vatican, he had both corrected the
   text of the Lectures previously published by Morel, and carefully
   transcribed the rest.  He made, according to Touttée, many useful
   emendations, but did not mention the number, age, nor various readings
   of the MSS. employed.

   6.  "S. Cyrilli Hier. Arch. opera quæ supersunt omnia; quorum quædam
   nunc primum ex Codd. MSS. edidit, reliqua cum Codd. MSS. contulit,
   plurimis in locis emendavit, Notisque illustravit Tho. Milles S.T.B. ex
   Æde Christi Oxoniæ, e Theatro Sheldoniano, Impensis Richardi Sare
   Bibliopol. Lond. MDCCIII."

   The author of this fine Edition gives us in his Preface the following
   description of his work:--

   "In the first place I wished to amend more thoroughly the text of J.
   Prevot, which, as I said, he himself largely corrected and supplied
   from MSS. in the Vatican, and which I have printed in this Edition:  I
   have therefore compared it with all the other Editions that I could
   collect, and in this manner have easily removed many errors both of the
   printers and of Prevot himself.  Afterwards I carefully compared all
   the Catecheses and the Epistle to Constantinus with two MSS. and some
   with three, namely iv., vi., viii.-x., xv., xvi., xviii.  The first
   Codex, written on parchment apparently six hundred years ago, I found
   among those MSS. which Sir Tho. Roe, our first Ambassador from King
   James I. to the Great Mogul, brought from the East, and presented to
   the Bodleian Library.  The second we owe to the diligence of Isaac
   Casaubon, who collated the Catecheses and Epistle to Constantius  with
   a MS. which he chanced to find, I think, in some Library in France, and
   carefully noted all the various readings in the margin.  This copy of
   Casaubon's the Right Reverend Father in Christ, John Bishop of Norwich,
   very kindly lent to me out of his well-furnished Library, and of his
   great love for learning did not disdain to shew the highest favour to
   my slight endeavours."

   Touttée thinks that the MS. from which Casaubon drew his various
   readings was C. Roe itself, or that one of the two MSS. had been copied
   from the other, or both from the same.

   7.  "S. Cyrilli Arch. Hier, opera quæ exstant omnia et ejus nomine
   circumferuntur, ad MSS. codices necnon ad superiores Editiones
   castigata, Dissertationibus et Notis illustrata, cum nova
   interpretatione et copiosis indicibus.  Cura et studio Domni
   Antonii-Augustini Touttéi, Presbyteri et Monachi Benedictini e
   Congregatione S. Mauri. Paris. Typis Jac. Vincent. 1720, fol. (Recusa
   Venet. 1763)."

   Of the Greek text the Editor says, "I have collated it as carefully as
   I could with Grodecq's translation, Morel's and Prevot's Editions, and
   with MSS. to be found in this City.  The various readings of the Roman
   MSS. I have obtained by the help of friends:  those which Milles had
   collected from the English Codices I have adopted for my own use."

   8.  "S. Cyrilli Hier. Arch. opp. quæ supersunt omnia ad libros MSS. et
   impressos recensuit Notis criticis commentariis indicibusque
   locupletissimis illustravit Gulielm. Car. Reischl S. Th. D. et Reg.
   Lycei Ambergensis Professor. Vol. I Monac. M DCCC XLVIII."

   The Editor says in his Preface that he has altered the Benedictine text
   only when the evidence was very weighty, and has then given all the
   various readings in the critical notes.  The exegetical commentary was
   to be reserved for the 2nd Volume, but this Dr. Reischl did not live to
   complete.

   The Prolegomena contain (1) Touttée's inordinately long "Life of
   Cyril," (2) a Dissertation on the general character and authenticity of
   the Catecheses, and (3) an "Apparatus Litterarius," to which I have
   been indebted.

   Vol. ii., containing Catecheses xii.-xviii., Myst. i.-v., and the other
   works, genuine and spurious, attributed to Cyril, was published by J.
   Rupp at Munich, 1860.

   The MSS. used in revising the text of this, the best critical edition,
   will be noticed below.

   9.  An Edition of the Catecheses only was published at Jerusalem in
   1867, having been commenced in 1849 at the request of the Archbishop,
   Cyril II., by Dionysius Kleopas, Principal of the Theological School of
   Jerusalem, and, after his death in 1861, continued by his successor
   Photius Alexandrides, "Archdeacon of the Apostolic and Patriarchal See
   of Jerusalem, and Principal of the Theological School."

   The Editor gives in the Preface an interesting account of the life of
   Kleopas, and of the work which he left unfinished.

   § 5.  Manuscripts.  From the preceding account of the various Editions
   of S. Cyril we may obtain the following list of authorities which have
   been hitherto used in revising the Text.

   1.  Codex Sirletianus, known only by Grodecq's Latin version, Rome,
   1564.  Cf. § 1. 3.

   2.  C. Mesmianus, known only in Morel's edition, Paris, 1564.  Cf. § i.
   4.

   3.  Vatican MSS. used by Prevot. 1608, but not identified.  Cf. § i. 5.

   4.  C. Roe, Bibl. Bodleian. Oxon.  "Codex membranaceus in folio, ff.
   223, sec. xi" binis columnis bene exaratus;" [ol. 271].

   5.  C. Casaubon.  On this and the preceding MS. see Milles as quoted
   above, § i. 6.

   6.  C. Ottobonianus (1) ol. Rom. iv. membran. sec. xi. "Continet
   Catecheses omnes et Epist. ad Constantium.  Multas habet insignes ab
   editis varietates."

   C. Ottob. (2), "Chartaceus et recens est, nihil fere ab editis
   discrepans."

   These are the Roman MSS. mentioned by Touttée:  see above, § i. 7.

   7.  C. Coislin. 227 (ol. 101).  Membran. Sæc. xi. circ.  "From this
   came many important emendations" (Touttée, Notitia Codicum MSS.).

   In the descriptions of the following MSS. of the National Library at
   Paris there is so much discrepancy between Touttée and Reischl, that it
   is better to quote both.

   8.  "Catecheses xii., xiii., xiv., xv., comparavi cum Codice Reg.
   bibliothecæ num. 2503.  Scriptus est in bombycina charta an. 1231, quam
   anni notam apposuit calligraphus" (Touttée, Not. Codd. MSS.).

   Reischl has no notice of a MS. at all answering to this description.

   9.  Cod. Reg. alter, "ol. 1260, nunc 1824, qui S. Basilii opera
   complectitur, sub ejus nomine Procatechesin continet " (Touttée, Not.
   Codd. MSS.):  aliter, "Cod. Reg. ol. 260, nunc 1284, pag. 254, qui
   duodecimi circiter est sæculi, in quo habetur Procatechesis hæc sub
   nomine S. Basilii" (Id. Monit. in Procatechesin).

   "Cod. Reg. 467 (apud Touttéum, 1824) Fonteblandensis, chartac. fol.
   sec. x.  Continet sub S. Basilii nomine Orationem de Baptismo, quæ est
   S. Cyrilli Hier. Procatechesis.  C. Reg. Touttéi" (Reischl).

   10.  "Cod. Reg. 969 (ol. Mazarin.) Epistolarum S. Basilii. 4°. Sec.
   xiv.  Exhibet sub n. 7 Basilii homiliam quo (sic) ostenditur Deum esse
   incomprehensibilem, quæ non S. Basilii, sed Cyrilli est Procatechesis"
   (Reischl).

   This description agrees in substance with Touttée's.

   11.  C. Colbert.  "Catecheses iv., vi., viii., ix., x., xv., xviii.,
   contuli cum cod. Colbert. Biblioth. chartaceo et recenti 4863
   notato...In omnibus pene cum Morelliana editione consentit" (Touttée,
   Notitia Codd. MSS.).

   Reischl makes no mention of this MS.

   12.  C. Colbert. alter. "membran. sign. 1717, Sec. xiii. diversas
   Patrum homilias continet, et Cat. xiii. exhibet sub nomine Cyrillianæ
   in Crucem et Porasceven homiliæ" (Touttée, Notitia).

   This is described by Reischl as "Cod. Reg. 771 (ol. 1717) Colbertinus.
   Membran. fol. seculi xiii.-xiv."

   The following MSS. have been used in Editions later than the
   Benedictine.

   13.  "C. Monacensis I. 394 membran. fol., titulis et initialibus
   miniatis, f. 261 nitidissime uncialibus minutis circiter seculo decimo
   in Oriente scriptus."

   This was regarded both by Reischl and by Rupp as the most important
   authority for the text:  it is much older than Codd. Roe, Casaub., and
   seems to be related to Codd. Ottobon. Coislin.

   C. Mon. 2 of the 16th Century is of little value.

   14.  "C. Vindobonensis, 55, membran. fol antiquissimus, sed incerto
   sæculo."

   A full account is given by Rupp in the Preface to Vol. ii.  It was
   collated by Joseph Müller, 1848, and contains all Cyril's Lectures,
   except the Procatechesis.

   15.  Codex A, found by Kleopas in the Library of the Archbishop of
   Cyprus, and used as the basis of his text, sometimes stands alone in
   preserving the true reading.

   § 6.  Versions.  Besides the Latin Translations published with the
   Greek text, as mentioned above, Reischl mentions the first three of the
   following:--

   (a)  Les catéchèses de Sainct Cyrille.  Traduit par Louis Ganey.
   Paris, 1564.

   (b)  Cyrill's Schriften übersetzt und mit Anmerkungen versehen von J.
   Mich. Feder.

   Bamberg, 1786.

   (c)  Cyrilli Hier. Catecheses in Armen. Linguam versæ.  Viennæ 1832.

   (d)  The Catechetical Lectures of S. Cyril, Archbishop of Jerusalem,
   Translated, with Notes and Indices (Library of Fathers of the Holy
   Catholic Church.) Parker, Oxford, 1838.  See Preface.

   (e)  S. Cyril on the Mysteries.  (The five Mystagogic Lectures.)  H. de
   Romestin.  Parker, Oxford, 1887.

   (f)  On Faith and the Creed.  C. A. Heurtley, D.D., Margaret Professor
   of Divinity, and Canon of Christ Church, Oxford.  Parker, 3rd Ed.,
   1889.  Contains, with other Treatises, the Fourth Catechetical Lecture
   of S. Cyril.

   In the present volume the translation given in the Oxford "Library of
   Fathers" has been carefully revised throughout.  Where it has been
   found necessary to depart from the Benedictine text, the Editor has
   consulted the readings and critical notes of Milles, Reischl, and Rupp,
   and the Jerusalem edition of Kleopas and Anaxandrides.

   A few additions have been made to the index of Subjects:  the Indices
   of Greek Words and of Scripture Texts have been much enlarged, and
   carefully revised.  For any errors which may have escaped observation
   the indulgence of the critical reader will not, it is hoped, be asked
   in vain.

   Catechetical Lectures

   S. Cyril,

   Archbishop of Jerusalem.

   ------------------------

   PROCATECHESIS,

   OR,

   PROLOGUE TO THE CATECHETICAL LECTURES OF OUR HOLY FATHER,

   CYRIL, ARCHBISHOP OF JERUSALEM.

   ------------------------

   1.  Already there is an odour of blessedness upon you, O ye who are
   soon to be enlightened [394] :  already ye are gathering the spiritual
   [395] flowers, to weave heavenly crowns:  already the fragrance of the
   Holy Spirit has breathed upon you:  already ye have gathered round the
   vestibule of the King's palace [396] ; may ye be led in also by the
   King!  For blossoms now have appeared upon the trees [397] ; may the
   fruit also be found perfect!  Thus far there has been an inscription of
   your names [398] , and a call to service, and torches [399] of the
   bridal train, and a longing for heavenly citizenship, and a good
   purpose, and hope attendant thereon.  For he lieth not who said, that
   to them that love God all things work together for good.  God is lavish
   in beneficence, yet He waits for each man's genuine will:  therefore
   the Apostle added and said, to them that are called according to a
   purpose [400] .  The honesty of purpose makes thee called:  for if thy
   body be here but not thy mind, it profiteth thee nothing.

   2.  Even Simon Magus once came to the Laver [401] :  he was baptized,
   but was not enlightened; and though he dipped his body in water, he
   enlightened not his heart with the Spirit:  his body went down and came
   up, but his soul was not buried with Christ, nor raised with Him [402]
   .  Now I mention the statements [403] of (men's) falls, that thou
   mayest not fall:  for these things happened to them by way of example,
   and they are written for the admonition [404] of those who to this day
   draw near.  Let none of you be found tempting His grace, lest any root
   of bitterness spring up and trouble you [405] .  Let none of you enter
   saying, Let us see what the faithful [406] are doing:  let me go in and
   see, that I may learn what is being done.  Dost thou expect to see, and
   not expect to be seen?  And thinkest thou, that whilst thou art
   searching out what is going on, God is not searching thy heart?

   3.  A certain man in the Gospels once pried into the marriage feast
   [407] , and took an unbecoming garment, and came in, sat down, and
   ate:  for the bridegroom permitted it.  But when he saw them all clad
   in white [408] , he ought to have assumed a garment of the same kind
   himself:  whereas he partook of the like food, but was unlike them in
   fashion and in purpose.  The bridegroom, however, though bountiful, was
   not undiscerning:  and in going round to each of the guests and
   observing them (for his care was not for their eating, but for their
   seemly behaviour), he saw a stranger not having on a wedding garment,
   and said to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither?  In what a colour
   [409] !  With what a conscience!  What though the door-keeper forbade
   thee not, because of the bountifulness of the entertainer? what though
   thou wert ignorant in what fashion thou shouldest come in to the
   banquet?--thou didst come in, and didst see the glittering fashions of
   the guests:  shouldest thou not have been taught even by what was
   before thine eyes?  Shouldest thou not have retired in good season,
   that thou mightest enter in good season again?  But now thou hast come
   in unseasonably, to be unseasonably cast out.  So he commands the
   servants, Bind his feet, which daringly intruded:  bind his hands,
   which knew not how to put a bright garment around him:  and cast him
   into the outer darkness; for he is unworthy of the wedding torches
   [410] .  Thou seest what happened to that man:  make thine own
   condition safe.

   4.  For we, the ministers of Christ, have admitted every one, and
   occupying, as it were, the place of door-keepers we left the door
   open:  and possibly thou didst enter with thy soul bemired with sins,
   and with a will defiled.  Enter thou didst, and wast allowed:  thy name
   was inscribed.  Tell me, dost thou behold this venerable constitution
   of the Church?  Dost thou view her order and discipline [411] , the
   reading of Scriptures [412] , the presence of the ordained [413] , the
   course of instruction [414] ?  Be abashed at the place, and be taught
   by what thou seest [415] .  Go out opportunely now, and enter most
   opportunely to-morrow.

   If the fashion of thy soul is avarice, put on another fashion and come
   in.  Put off thy former fashion, cloke it not up.  Put off, I pray
   thee, fornication and uncleanness, and put on the brightest robe of
   chastity.  This charge I give thee, before Jesus the Bridegroom of
   souls come in and see their fashions.  A long notice [416] is allowed
   thee; thou hast forty [417] days for repentance:  thou hast full
   opportunity both to put off, and wash, and to put on and enter.  But if
   thou persist in an evil purpose, the speaker is blameless, but thou
   must not look for the grace:  for the water will receive, but the
   Spirit will not accept thee [418] .  If any one is conscious of his
   wound, let him take the salve; if any has fallen, let him arise.  Let
   there be no Simon among you, no hypocrisy, no idle curiosity about the
   matter.

   5.  Possibly too thou art come on another pretext.  It is possible that
   a man is wishing to pay court to a woman, and came hither on that
   account [419] .  The remark applies in like manner to women also in
   their turn.  A slave also perhaps wishes to please his master, and a
   friend his friend.  I accept this bait for the hook, and welcome thee,
   though thou camest with an evil purpose, yet as one to be saved by a
   good hope.  Perhaps thou knewest not whither thou wert coming, nor in
   what kind of net thou art taken.  Thou art come within the Church's
   nets [420] :  be taken alive, flee not:  for Jesus is angling for thee,
   not in order to kill, but by killing to make alive:  for thou must die
   and rise again.  For thou hast heard the Apostle say, Dead indeed unto
   sin, but living unto righteousness [421] .  Die to thy sins, and live
   to righteousness, live from this very day.

   6.  See, I pray thee, how great a dignity Jesus bestows on thee.  Thou
   wert called a Catechumen, while the word echoed [422] round thee from
   without; hearing of hope, and knowing it not; hearing mysteries, and
   not understanding them; hearing Scriptures, and not knowing their
   depth.  The echo is no longer around thee, but within thee; for the
   indwelling Spirit [423] henceforth makes thy mind a house of God.  When
   thou shalt have heard what is written concerning the mysteries, then
   wilt thou understand things which thou knewest not.  And think not that
   thou receivest a small thing:  though a miserable man, thou receivest
   one of God's titles.  Hear St. Paul saying, God is faithful [424] .
   Hear another Scripture saying, God is faithful and just [425] .
   Foreseeing this, the Psalmist, because men are to receive a title of
   God, spoke thus in the person of God:  I said, Ye are Gods, and are all
   sons of the Most High [426] .  But beware lest thou have the title of
   "faithful," but the will of the faithless.  Thou hast entered into a
   contest, toil on through the race:  another such opportunity thou canst
   not have [427] .  Were it thy wedding-day before thee, wouldest thou
   not have disregarded all else, and set about the preparation for the
   feast?  And on the eve of consecrating thy soul to the heavenly
   Bridegroom, wilt thou not cease from carnal things, that thou mayest
   win spiritual?

   7.  We may not receive Baptism twice or thrice; else it might be said,
   Though I have failed once, I shall set it right a second time:  whereas
   if thou fail once, the thing cannot be set right; for there is one
   Lord, and one faith, and one baptism [428] :  for only the heretics are
   re-baptized [429] , because the former was no baptism.

   8.  For God seeks nothing else from us, save a good purpose.  Say not,
   How are my sins blotted out?  I tell thee, By willing, by believing
   [430] .  What can be shorter than this?  But if, while thy lips declare
   thee willing, thy heart be silent, He knoweth the heart, who judgeth
   thee.  Cease from this day from every evil deed.  Let not thy tongue
   speak unseemly words, let thine eye abstain from sin, and from roving
   [431] after things unprofitable.

   9.  Let thy feet hasten to the catechisings; receive with earnestness
   the exorcisms [432] :  whether thou be breathed upon or exorcised, the
   act is to thee salvation.  Suppose thou hast gold unwrought and
   alloyed, mixed with various substances, copper, and tin, and iron, and
   lead:  we seek to have the gold alone; can gold be purified from the
   foreign substances without fire?  Even so without exorcisms the soul
   cannot be purified; and these exorcisms are divine, having been
   collected out of the divine Scriptures.  Thy face has been veiled [433]
   , that thy mind may henceforward be free, lest the eye by roving make
   the heart rove also.  But when thine eyes are veiled, thine ears are
   not hindered from receiving the means of salvation.  For in like manner
   as those who are skilled in the goldsmith's craft throw in their breath
   upon the fire through certain delicate instruments, and blowing up the
   gold which is hidden in the crucible stir the flame which surrounds it,
   and so find what they are seeking; even so when the exorcists inspire
   terror by the Spirit of God, and set the soul, as it were, on fire in
   the crucible of the body, the hostile demon flees away, and there abide
   salvation and the hope of eternal life, and the soul henceforth is
   cleansed from its sins and hath salvation.  Let us then, brethren,
   abide in hope, and surrender ourselves, and hope, in order that the God
   of all may see our purpose, and cleanse us from our sins, and impart to
   us good hopes of our estate, and grant us repentance that bringeth
   salvation.  God hath called, and His call is to thee.

   10.  Attend closely to the catechisings, and though we should prolong
   our discourse, let not thy mind be wearied out.  For thou art receiving
   armour against the adverse power, armour against heresies, against
   Jews, and Samaritans [434] , and Gentiles.  Thou hast many enemies;
   take to thee many darts, for thou hast many to hurl them at:  and thou
   hast need to learn how to strike down the Greek, how to contend against
   heretic, against Jew and Samaritan.  And the armour is ready, and most
   ready the sword of the Spirit [435] :  but thou also must stretch forth
   thy right hand with good resolution, that thou mayest war the Lord's
   warfare, and overcome adverse powers, and become invincible against
   every heretical attempt.

   11.  Let me give thee this charge also.  Study our teachings and keep
   them for ever.  Think not that they are the ordinary homilies [436] ;
   for though they also are good and trustworthy, yet if we should neglect
   them to-day we may study them to-morrow.  But if the teaching
   concerning the laver of regeneration delivered in a consecutive course
   be neglected to-day, when shall it be made right?  Suppose it is the
   season for planting trees:  if we do not dig, and dig deep, when else
   can that be planted rightly which has once been planted ill?  Suppose,
   pray, that the Catechising is a kind of building:  if we do not bind
   the house together by regular bonds in the building, lest some gap be
   found, and the building become unsound, even our former labour is of no
   use.  But stone must follow stone by course, and corner match with
   corner, and by our smoothing off inequalities the building must thus
   rise evenly.  In like manner we are bringing to thee stones, as it
   were, of knowledge.  Thou must hear concerning the living God, thou
   must hear of Judgment, must hear of Christ, and of the Resurrection.
   And many things there are to be discussed in succession, which though
   now dropped one by one are afterwards to be presented in harmonious
   connexion.  But unless thou fit them together in the one whole, and
   remember what is first, and what is second, the builder may build, but
   thou wilt find the building unsound.

   12.  When, therefore, the Lecture is delivered, if a Catechumen ask
   thee what the teachers have said, tell nothing to him that is without
   [437] .  For we deliver to thee a mystery, and a hope of the life to
   come.  Guard the mystery for Him who gives the reward.  Let none ever
   say to thee, What harm to thee, if I also know it?  So too the sick ask
   for wine; but if it be given at a wrong time it causes delirium, and
   two evils arise; the sick man dies, and the physician is blamed.  Thus
   is it also with the Catechumen, if he hear anything from the believer:
   both the Catechumen becomes delirious (for he understands not what he
   has heard, and finds fault with the thing, and scoffs at what is said),
   and the believer is condemned as a traitor.  But thou art now standing
   on the border:  take heed, pray, to tell nothing out; not that the
   things spoken are not worthy to be told, but because his ear is
   unworthy to receive.  Thou wast once thyself a Catechumen, and I
   described not what lay before thee.  When by experience thou hast
   learned how high are the matters of our teaching, then thou wilt know
   that the Catechumens are not worthy to hear them.

   13.  Ye who have been enrolled are become sons and daughters of one
   Mother.  When ye have come in before the hour of the exorcisms, let
   each one of you speak things tending to godliness:  and if any of your
   number be not present, seek for him.  If thou wert called to a banquet,
   wouldest thou not wait for thy fellow guest?  If thou hadst a brother,
   wouldest thou not seek thy brother's good?

   Afterwards busy not thyself about unprofitable matters:  neither, what
   the city has done, nor the village, nor the King [438] , nor the
   Bishop, nor the Presbyter.  Look upward; that is what thy present hour
   needeth.  Be still [439] , and know that I am God.  If thou seest the
   believers ministering, and shewing no care, they enjoy security, they
   know what they have received, they are in possession of grace.  But
   thou standest just now in the turn of the scale, to be received or
   not:  copy not those who have freedom from anxiety, but cherish fear.

   14.  And when the Exorcism has been done, until the others who are
   being exorcised have come [440] , let men be with men, and women with
   women.  For now I need the example of Noah's ark:  in which were Noah
   and his sons, and his wife and his sons' wives.  For though the ark was
   one, and the door was shut, yet had things been suitably arranged.  If
   the Church is shut, and you are all inside, yet let there be a
   separation, men with men, and women with women [441] :  lest the
   pretext of salvation become an occasion of destruction.  Even if there
   be a fair pretext for sitting near each other, let passions be put
   away.  Further, let the men when sitting have a useful book; and let
   one read, and another listen:  and if there be no book, let one pray,
   and another speak something useful.  And again let the party of young
   women sit together in like manner, either singing or reading quietly,
   so that their lips speak, but others' ears catch not the sound:  for I
   suffer not a woman to speak in the Church [442] .  And let the married
   woman also follow the same example, and pray; and let her lips move,
   but her voice be unheard, that a Samuel [443] may come, and thy barren
   soul give birth to the salvation of "God who hath heard thy prayer;"
   for this is the interpretation of the name Samuel.

   15.  I shall observe each man's earnestness, each woman's reverence.
   Let your mind be refined as by fire unto reverence; let your soul be
   forged as metal:  let the stubbornness of unbelief be hammered out:
   let the superfluous scales of the iron drop off, and what is pure
   remain; let the rust of the iron be rubbed off, and the true metal
   remain.  May God sometime shew you that night, the darkness which
   shines like the day, concerning which it is said, The darkness shall
   not be hidden from thee, and the night shall shine as the day [444] .
   Then may the gate of Paradise be opened to every man and every woman
   among you.  Then may you enjoy the Christ-bearing waters in their
   fragrance [445] .  Then may you receive the name of Christ [446] , and
   the power of things divine.  Even now, I beseech you, lift up the eye
   of the mind:  even now imagine the choirs of Angels, and God the Lord
   of all there sitting, and His Only-begotten Son sitting with Him on His
   right hand, and the Spirit present with them; and Thrones and Dominions
   doing service, and every man of you and every woman receiving
   salvation.  Even now let your ears ring, as it were, with that glorious
   sound, when over your salvation the angels shall chant, Blessed are
   they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered [447] :
   when like stars of the Church you shall enter in, bright in the body
   and radiant in the soul.

   16.  Great is the Baptism that lies before you [448] :  a ransom to
   captives; a remission of offences; a death of sin; a new-birth of the
   soul; a garment of light; a holy indissoluble seal; a chariot to
   heaven; the delight of Paradise; a welcome into the kingdom; the gift
   of adoption!  But there is a serpent by the wayside watching those who
   pass by:  beware lest he bite thee with unbelief.  He sees so many
   receiving salvation, and is seeking whom he may devour [449] .  Thou
   art coming in unto the Father of Spirits, but thou art going past that
   serpent.  How then mayest thou pass him?  Have thy feet shod with the
   preparation of the gospel of peace [450] ; that even if he bite, he may
   not hurt thee.  Have faith in-dwelling, stedfast hope, a strong sandal,
   that thou mayest pass the enemy, and enter the presence of thy Lord.
   Prepare thine own heart for reception of doctrine, for fellowship in
   holy mysteries.  Pray more frequently, that God may make thee worthy of
   the heavenly and immortal mysteries.  Cease not day nor night:  but
   when sleep is banished from thine eyes, then let thy mind be free for
   prayer.  And if thou find any shameful thought rise up in thy mind,
   turn to meditation upon Judgment to remind thee of Salvation.  Give thy
   mind wholly to study, that it may forget base things.  If thou find any
   one saying to thee, Art thou then going in, to descend into the water?
   Has the city just now no baths? take notice that it is the dragon of
   the sea [451] who is laying these plots against thee.  Attend not to
   the lips of the talker, but to God who worketh in thee.  Guard thine
   own soul, that thou be not ensnared, to the end that abiding in hope
   thou mayest become an heir of everlasting salvation.

   17.  We for our part as men charge and teach you thus:  but make not ye
   our building hay and stubble and chaff, lest we suffer loss, from our
   work being burnt up:  but make ye our work gold, and silver, and
   precious stones [452] !  For it lies in me to speak, but in thee to set
   thy mind [453] upon it, and in God to make perfect.  Let us nerve our
   minds, and brace up our souls, and prepare our hearts.  The race is for
   our soul:  our hope is of things eternal:  and God, who knoweth your
   hearts, and observeth who is sincere, and who a hypocrite, is able both
   to guard the sincere, and to give faith to the hypocrite:  for even to
   the unbeliever, if only he give his heart, God is able to give faith.
   So may He blot out the handwriting that is against you [454] ,  and
   grant you forgiveness of your former trespasses; may He plant you into
   His Church, and enlist you in His own service, and put on you the
   armour of righteousness [455] :  may He fill you with the heavenly
   things of the New Covenant, and give you the seal of the Holy Spirit
   indelible throughout all ages, in Christ Jesus Our Lord:  to whom be
   the glory for ever and ever!  Amen.

   (To the Reader [456] .)

   These Catechetical Lectures for those who are to be enlightened thou
   mayest lend to candidates for Baptism, and to believers who are already
   baptized, to read, but give not at all [457] , neither to Catechumens,
   nor to any others who are not Christians, as thou shalt answer to the
   Lord.  And if thou make a copy, write this in the beginning, as in the
   sight of the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [394] The "blessedness" is the grace of Baptism, the hope of which is
   as a fragrant odour already borne towards the Candidates.  These were
   called no longer Catechumens, but photizomenoi, as already on the way
   "to be enlightened."  Compare xvi. 26, the last sentence, and see
   Index, "enlighten."

   [395] noeta.  The word is much used by Plato to distinguish things
   which can be discerned only by the mind from the objects of sight and
   sense.  Here "the spiritual (or, mental) flowers" are the Divine truths
   in which "the fragrance of the Holy Spirit" breathes.

   [396] By "the vestibule" is meant "the outer hall of the Baptistery"
   (xix. 2), and by "the King's Palace" the Baptistery itself, which Cyril
   calls "the inner chamber" (xx. 1) and "the bride-chamber" (iii. 2;
   xxii. 2).  See Index, "Baptistery."  Here the local terms have also an
   allegorical sense, Baptism being regarded as the marriage of the Soul
   to Christ.

   [397] Another allegory, from the season of Spring, when the Lectures
   were delivered.

   [398] onomatographia.  See Index.

   [399] That the Candidates on their first admission carried torches or
   lighted tapers in procession is a conjecture founded on this passage
   and Lect. I. 1:  "Ye who have just lighted the torches of faith,
   preserve them in your hands unquenched."  But see Index, "Lights."

   [400] Rom. viii. 28.  In S. Paul's argument the "purpose" is God's
   eternal purpose of salvation through Christ (Eph. i. 11; iii. 11):  but
   Cyril applies it here to sincerity of purpose in coming to Baptism.

   [401] Acts viii. 13.

   [402] Rom. vi. 4; Col. ii. 12.

   [403] Greek, hupographe, meaning either an "indictment," or a
   descriptive "sketch."  For the former meaning, see Plato, Theaet. 172,
   E.  hupographen ...hen antomosian kalousin.

   [404] 1 Cor. x. 11.

   [405] Heb. xii. 15.

   [406] "The faithful" are those who have been already baptized, and
   instructed in those mysteries of the Christian Faith which were
   reserved for the initiated.  See Index, "Faithful."

   [407] Matt. xxii. 12.  The same passage is applied to Baptism in Cat.
   iii. 2.

   [408] See Cat. xxii. 8 and Index, "White."

   [409] The Greed word (chroma) is used by Ignatius in the beginning of
   his Epistle to the Romans of a discolouring stain.

   [410] Compare § 1, note 6.

   [411] The Greek word (episteme) which commonly means "knowledge" or
   "understanding," is applied here and in vi. 35 to the intelligence and
   skill displayed in the arrangement of the public services of the
   Church.  Compare Apostolic Constitutions, ii. 57, where the Bishop is
   exhorted to have the assemblies arranged meta pases epistemes.

   [412] In the same passage of the Apostolic Constitutions precise
   directions are given for reading a Lesson from the Old Testament,
   singing the Psalms, and reading the Epistle and Gospel.

   [413] By "the ordained" (kanonikon) are meant all whose names were
   registered as bearing office in the Church, Priests, Deacons,
   Deaconesses, Monks, Virgins, Widows, all having their appointed placed
   and proper duties.  Apost. Canon. 70, ei tis episkopos, e presbuteros,
   e diakonos, e holos tou katalogou ton klerikon, k.t.l.

   [414] Compare Apost. Const. as above:  "Let the Presbyters one by one,
   not all together, exhort the people; and the Bishop last, as being the
   commander."

   [415] S. Aug. de Civit. Dei., ii. 28:  "Though some come to mock at
   such admonitions, all their insolence is either humbled by a sudden
   conversation (immutatio) or suppressed by fear or shame."

   [416] Greek, prothesmia.  Compare Gal. iv. 2:  "the time appointed of
   the father."  At Athens it meant a "limitation," or fixed period within
   which a debt must be claimed or paid, or an action commenced.

   [417] Index, "Lent."

   [418] Compare xvii. 36.

   [419] S. Ambrose on the 119th Psalm, Serm. xx. § 48, speaks of some who
   pretended to be Christians in order to marry one whose parents would
   not give her in marriage to a heathen.

   [420] Matt. xiii. 47.

   [421] Rom. vi. 11, 14.

   [422] S. Cyril plays upon the word "Catechumen," which has the same
   root as "echo."

   [423] Rom. viii. 9, 11.

   [424] 1 Cor. i. 9.

   [425] 1 John i. 9.

   [426] Ps. lxxxi. 6.

   [427] Compare xvii. 36.

   [428] Eph. iv. 5.

   [429] This sentence is omitted in one ms. (Paris, 1824), but probably
   only through the repetition of the word "baptism."  On the laws of the
   Church against the repetition of Baptism, and concerning the re-baptism
   of heretics, see Tertull. de Baptismo, c. xv:  Apost. Const. xv.:
   Bingham, xii. 5:  Hefele, Councils, Lib. I. c. 2:  Dictionary Christian
   Antiq. I. p. 167 a.

   [430] Rufinus, in the Exposition of the Creed, on the Remission of
   sins:  "The Pagans are wont to say in derision of us, that we deceive
   ourselves in thinking that crimes which have been committed in deed can
   be washed out by words."

   [431] The reading in the Benedictine Edition, mede ho nous sou
   rhembestho, has little authority, and is quite unsuitable.  See below,
   to blemma rhembomenon.

   [432] Index, "Exorcism."

   [433] Index, "Veiling."

   [434] The Samaritans are frequently mentioned by Epiphanius and other
   writers of the 4th century among the chief adversaries of
   Christianity.  "In their humble synagogue, at the foot of the mountain
   (Gerizim), the Samaritans still worship, the oldest and the smallest
   sect in the world."  (Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 240.)

   [435] Eph. vi. 17.

   [436] See above, § 4, note 3.

   [437] On the Disciplina Arcani, or rule against publishing the
   Christian Creed and Mysteries to Catechumens and Gentiles, see Index,
   "Mysteries."

   [438] The title "King" (Basileus) is used in the Greek Liturgies and
   Fathers of the Roman Emperor, as in the Clementine Liturgy:  huper tou
   basileos, kai ton en huperoche, where it is taken from 1 Tim. ii. 2.
   Compare Cat. xiv. 14, and 22:  Konstantinou tou basileos.

   [439] Ps. xlvi. 10.  Sept. scholasate, "give attention freely."

   [440] From S. Augustine, de Symbolo, i. 1 (Migne T. vi. p. 930), we
   learn that the Candidates were brought in before the Congregation one
   by one for exorcism; and so, as Cyril here shews, they had to wait
   outside till the others returned.

   [441] Chrys. in Matt. Hom. lxxiv. § 3:  "You ought to have within you
   the wall that separates you from the women:  but since ye will not, our
   fathers have thought it necessary to separate you at least by these
   boards; for I have heard from my elders that there were not these walls
   in old times."  These barriers had not yet been introduced at
   Jerusalem, or Cyril's admonition would have been needless.  Compare
   Apostolic Constitutions, II. 57.

   [442] 1 Cor. xiv. 34; 1 Tim. ii. 12.

   [443] 1 Sam. i. 13, 20.  On the various interpretations of the name
   Samuel, see Dict. Bib. "Samuel," and Driver on the passage.  Cyril
   adopts the meaning "heard of God."

   [444] Ps. cxxxix. 12.  On Easter Eve the Church was full of lights
   which were kept burning all night, and the newly-baptized carried
   torches.  Gregory of Nyssa, preaching on the Resurrection (Orat. iv.)
   describes the scene:  "This brilliant night, by mingling the flames of
   torches with the morning rays of the sun, has made one continuous day,
   not divided by the interposition of darkness."

   [445] Or, as the Benedictine Editor conjectures, "the waters which have
   a Christ-bearing (christophoron) fragrance."  On the epithet
   christophoros, see Bishop Lightfoot's note on Ignat. ad Eph. § 1 and §
   9.  Its meaning, as well as that of Theophoros is defined in the answer
   of Ignatius to Trajan, O Christon echon en sternois (Martyr. Ign. Ant.
   § 2).

   [446] Cat. xxi. 1:  "made partakers therefore of Christ, ye are rightly
   called Christs."

   [447] Ps. xxxii. 1, which verse is still chanted in the Greek Church as
   soon as the Baptism is completed.

   [448] S. Basil has a passage in praise of Baptism almost the same, word
   for word, with this.  It is more likely to have been borrowed from
   Cyril by Basil and other Fathers, than to be a later interpolation
   here.

   [449] 1 Pet. v. 8.

   [450] Eph. vi. 15.

   [451] Is. xxvii. 1.

   [452] 1 Cor. iii. 12, 15.

   [453] Greek prosthesthai, Sept. Deut. xiii. 4, "cleave unto Him."
   Compare Josh. xxiii. 12; Ps. lxii. 10, "Set not your heart upon them."

   [454] Col. ii. 14.

   [455] 2 Cor. vi. 7; Rom. vi. 13.

   [456] It is doubtful whether this caution proceeded from Cyril himself
   when issuing a written copy of his Lectures, or from some later
   editor.  Eusebius (E.H. v. 20) has preserved an adjuration by Irenæus
   at the end of his treatise, On the Ogdoad:  I adjure thee, who mayest
   transcribe this book, by Our Lord Jesus Christ, and by His glorious
   advent, when He cometh to judge the quick and the dead, to compare what
   thou hast written and correct it carefully by this copy, from which
   thou hast transcribed it; this adjuration also thou shalt write in like
   manner, and set it in the copy.

   FIRST CATECHETICAL LECTURE

   of

   Our Holy Father Cyril,

   Archbishop of Jerusalem,

   To those who are to be Enlightened, delivered extempore at Jerusalem,
   as an Introductory Lecture to those who had come forward for Baptism
   [458] :

   With a reading from Isaiah

   Wash you, make you clean; put away your iniquities from your souls,
   from before mine eyes, and the rest [459] .

   1.  Disciples of the New Testament and partakers of the mysteries of
   Christ, as yet by calling only, but ere long by grace also, make you a
   new heart and a new spirit [460] , that there may be gladness among the
   inhabitants of heaven:  for if over one sinner that repenteth there is
   joy, according to the Gospel [461] , how much more shall the salvation
   of so many souls move the inhabitants of heaven to gladness.  As ye
   have entered upon a good and most glorious path, run with reverence the
   race of godliness.  For the Only-begotten Son of God is present here
   most ready to redeem you, saying, Come unto Me all that labour and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest [462] .  Ye that are clothed with
   the rough garment [463] of your offences, who are holden with the cords
   of your own sins, hear the voice of the Prophet saying, Wash you, make
   you clean, put away your iniquities from before Mine eyes [464] :  that
   the choir of Angels may chant over you, Blessed are they whose
   iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered [465] .  Ye who
   have just lighted the torches of faith [466] , guard them carefully in
   your hands unquenched; that He, who erewhile on this all-holy Golgotha
   opened Paradise to the robber on account of his faith, may grant to you
   to sing the bridal song.

   2.  If any here is a slave of sin, let him promptly prepare himself
   through faith for the new birth into freedom and adoption; and having
   put off the miserable bondage of his sins, and taken on him the most
   blessed bondage of the Lord, so may he be counted worthy to inherit the
   kingdom of heaven.  Put off, by confession [467] , the old man, which
   waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit, that ye may put on the new
   man, which is renewed according to knowledge of Him that created him
   [468] .  Get you the earnest of the Holy Spirit [469] through faith,
   that ye may be able to be received into the everlasting habitations
   [470] .  Come for the mystical Seal, that ye may be easily recognised
   by the Master; be ye numbered among the holy and spiritual flock of
   Christ, to be set apart on His right hand, and inherit the life
   prepared for you.  For they to whom the rough garment [471] of their
   sins still clings are found on the left hand, because they came not to
   the grace of God which is given through Christ at the new birth of
   Baptism:  new birth I mean not of bodies, but the spiritual new birth
   of the soul.  For our bodies are begotten by parents who are seen, but
   our souls are begotten anew through faith:  for the Spirit bloweth
   where it listeth [472] :  and then, if thou be found worthy, thou
   mayest hear, Well done, good and faithful servant [473] , when thou art
   found to have no defilement of hypocrisy in thy conscience.

   3.  For if any of those who are present should think to tempt God's
   grace, he deceives himself, and knows not its power.  Keep thy soul
   free from hypocrisy, O man, because of Him who searcheth hearts and
   reins [474] .  For as those who are going to make a levy for war
   examine the ages and the bodies of those who are taking service, so
   also the Lord in enlisting souls examines their purpose:  and if any
   has a secret hypocrisy, He rejects the man as unfit for His true
   service; but if He finds one worthy, to him He readily gives His
   grace.  He gives not holy things to the dogs [475] ; but where He
   discerns the good conscience, there He gives the Seal of salvation,
   that wondrous Seal, which devils tremble at, and Angels recognise; that
   the one may be driven to flight, and the others may watch around it as
   kindred to themselves.  Those therefore who receive this spiritual and
   saving Seal, have need also of the disposition akin to it.  For as a
   writing-reed or a dart has need of one to use it, so grace also has
   need of believing minds.

   4.  Thou art receiving not a perishable but a spiritual shield.
   Henceforth thou art planted in the invisible [476] Paradise.  Thou
   receivest a new name, which thou hadst not before.  Heretofore thou
   wast a Catechumen, but now thou wilt be called a Believer.  Thou art
   transplanted henceforth among the spiritual [477] olive-trees, being
   grafted from the wild into the good olive-tree [478] , from sins into
   righteousness, from pollutions into purity.  Thou art made partaker of
   the Holy Vine [479] .  Well then, if thou abide in the Vine, thou
   growest as a fruitful branch; but if thou abide not, thou wilt be
   consumed by the fire.  Let us therefore bear fruit worthily.  God
   forbid that in us should be done what befell that barren fig-tree [480]
   , that Jesus come not even now and curse us for our barrenness.  But
   may all be able to use that other saying, But I am like a fruitful
   olive-tree in the house of God:  I have trusted in the mercy of God for
   ever [481] ,--an olive-tree not to be perceived by sense, but by the
   mind [482] , and full of light.  As then it is His part to plant and to
   water [483] , so it is thine to bear fruit:  it is God's to grant
   grace, but thine to receive and guard it.  Despise not the grace
   because it is freely given, but receive and treasure it devoutly.

   5.  The present is the season of confession:  confess what thou hast
   done in word or in deed, by night or by day; confess in an acceptable
   time, and in the day of salvation [484] receive the heavenly treasure.
   Devote thy time to the Exorcisms:  be assiduous at the Catechisings,
   and remember the things that shall be spoken, for they are spoken not
   for thine ears only, but that by faith thou mayest seal them up in the
   memory.  Blot out from thy mind all earthly [485] care:  for thou art
   running for thy soul.  Thou art utterly forsaking the things of the
   world:  little are the things which thou art forsaking, great what the
   Lord is giving.  Forsake things present, and put thy trust in things to
   come.  Hast thou run so many circles of the years busied in vain about
   the world, and hast thou not forty days to be free (for prayer [486] ),
   for thine own soul's sake?  Be still [487] , and know that I am God,
   saith the Scripture.  Excuse thyself from talking many idle words:
   neither backbite, nor lend a willing ear to backbiters; but rather be
   prompt to prayer.  Shew in ascetic exercise that thy heart is nerved
   [488] .  Cleanse thy vessel, that thou mayest receive grace more
   abundantly.  For though remission of sins is given equally to all, the
   communion of the Holy Ghost is bestowed in proportion to each man's
   faith.  If thou hast laboured little, thou receivest little; but if
   thou hast wrought much, the reward is great.  Thou art running for
   thyself, see to thine own interest.

   6.  If thou hast aught against any man, forgive it:  thou comest here
   to receive forgiveness of sins, and thou also must forgive him that
   hath sinned against thee.  Else with what face wilt thou say to the
   Lord, Forgive me my many sins, if thou hast not thyself forgiven thy
   fellow-servant even his little sins.  Attend diligently the Church
   assemblies [489] ; not only now when diligent attendance is required of
   thee by the Clergy, but also after thou hast received the grace.  For
   if, before thou hast received it, the practice is good, is it not also
   good after the bestowal?  If before thou be grafted in, it is a safe
   course to be watered and tended, is it not far better after the
   planting?  Wrestle for thine own soul, especially in such days as
   these.  Nourish thy soul with sacred readings; for the Lord hath
   prepared for thee a spiritual table; therefore say thou also after the
   Psalmist, The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall lack nothing:  in a
   place of grass, there hath He made me rest; He hath fed me beside the
   waters of comfort, He hath converted my soul [490] :--that Angels also
   may share your joy, and Christ Himself the great High Priest, having
   accepted your resolve, may present you all to the Father, saying,
   Behold, I and the children whom God hath given Me [491] .  May He keep
   you all well-pleasing in His sight!  To whom be the glory, and the
   power unto the endless ages of eternity.  Amen.

   Lecture II.

   On Repentance and Remission of Sins, and Concerning the Adversary.

   Ezekiel xviii. 20-23

   The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the
   wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.  But if the wicked will
   turn from all his sins, &c.

   1.  A fearful thing is sin, and the sorest disease of the soul is
   transgression, secretly cutting its sinews, and becoming also the cause
   of eternal fire; an evil of a man's own choosing, an offspring of the
   will. [492]   For that we sin of our own free will the Prophet says
   plainly in a certain place:  Yet I planted thee a fruitful vine, wholly
   true:  how art thou turned to bitterness, (and become) the strange vine
   [493] ?  The planting was good, the fruit coming from the will is evil;
   and therefore the planter is blameless, but the vine shall be burnt
   with fire since it was planted for good, and bore fruit unto evil of
   its own will.  For God, according to the Preacher, made man upright,
   and they have themselves sought out many inventions [494] .  For we are
   His workmanship, says the Apostle, created unto good works, which God
   afore prepared, that we should walk in them [495] .  So then the
   Creator, being good, created for good works; but the creature turned of
   its own free will to wickedness.  Sin then is, as we have said, a
   fearful evil, but not incurable; fearful for him who clings to it, but
   easy of cure for him who by repentance puts it from him.  For suppose
   that a man is holding fire in his hand; as long as he holds fast the
   live coal he is sure to be burned, but should he put away the coal, he
   would have cast away the flame also with it.  If however any one thinks
   that he is not being burned when sinning, to him the Scripture saith,
   Shall a man wrap up fire in his bosom, and not burn his clothes [496]
   ?  For sin burns the sinews of the soul, [and breaks the spiritual
   bones of the mind, and darkens the light of the heart [497] ].

   2.  But some one will say, What can sin be?  Is it a living thing?  Is
   it an angel?  Is it a demon?  What is this which works within us?  It
   is not an enemy, O man, that assails thee from without, but an evil
   shoot growing up out of thyself.  Look right on with thine eyes [498] ,
   and there is no lust.  [Keep thine own, and [499] ] seize not the
   things of others, and robbery has ceased [500] .  Remember the
   Judgment, and neither fornication, nor adultery, nor murder, nor any
   transgression of the law shall prevail with thee.  But whenever thou
   forgettest God, forthwith thou beginnest to devise wickedness and to
   commit iniquity.

   3.  Yet thou art not the sole author of the evil, but there is also
   another most wicked prompter, the devil.  He indeed suggests, but does
   not get the mastery by force over those who do not consent.  Therefore
   saith the Preacher, If the spirit of him that hath power rise up
   against thee, quit not thy place [501] .  Shut thy door, and put him
   far from thee, and he shall not hurt thee.  But if thou indifferently
   admit the thought of lust, it strikes root in thee by its suggestions,
   and enthrals thy mind, and drags thee down into a pit of evils.

   But perhaps thou sayest, I am a believer, and lust does not gain the
   ascendant over me, even if I think upon it frequently.  Knowest thou
   not that a root breaks even a rock by long persistence?  Admit not the
   seed, since it will rend thy faith asunder:  tear out the evil by the
   root before it blossom, lest from being careless at the beginning thou
   have afterwards to seek for axes and fire.  When thine eyes begin to be
   diseased, get them cured in good time, lest thou become blind, and then
   have to seek the physician.

   4.  The devil then is the first author of sin, and the father of the
   wicked:  and this is the Lord's saying, not mine, that the devil
   sinneth from the beginning [502] :  none sinned before him.  But he
   sinned, not as having received necessarily from nature the propensity
   to sin, since then the cause of sin is traced back again to Him that
   made him so; but having been created good, he has of his own free will
   become a devil, and received that name from his action.  For being an
   Archangel [503] he was afterwards called a devil from his slandering:
   from being a good servant of God he has become rightly named Satan; for
   "Satan" is interpreted the adversary [504] .  And this is not my
   teaching, but that of the inspired prophet Ezekiel:  for he takes up a
   lamentation over him and says, Thou wast a seal of likeness, and a
   crown of beauty; in the Paradise of God wast thou born [505] :  and
   soon after, Thou wast born blameless in thy days, from the day in which
   thou wast created, until thine iniquities were found in thee.  Very
   rightly hath he said, were found in thee; for they were not brought in
   from without, but thou didst thyself beget the evil.  The cause also he
   mentions forthwith:  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty:
   for the multitude of thy sins wast thou wounded, and I did cast thee to
   the ground.  In agreement with this the Lord says again in the
   Gospels:  I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven [506] .  Thou
   seest the harmony of the Old Testament with the New.  He when cast out
   drew many away with him.  It is he that puts lusts into them that
   listen to him:  from him come adultery, fornication, and every kind of
   evil.  Through him our forefather Adam was cast out for disobedience,
   and exchanged a Paradise bringing forth wondrous fruits of its own
   accord for the ground which bringeth forth thorns.

   5.  What then? some one will say.  We have been beguiled and are lost.
   Is there then no salvation left?  We have fallen:  Is it not possible
   to rise again?  We have been blinded:  May we not recover our sight?
   We have become crippled:  Can we never walk upright?  In a word, we are
   dead:  May we not rise again?  He that woke Lazarus who was four days
   dead and already stank, shall He not, O man, much more easily raise
   thee who art alive?  He who shed His precious blood for us, shall
   Himself deliver us from sin.  Let us not despair of ourselves,
   brethren; let us not abandon ourselves to a hopeless condition.  For it
   is a fearful thing not to believe in a hope of repentance.  For he that
   looks not for salvation spares not to add evil to evil:  but to him
   that hopes for cure, it is henceforth easy to be careful over himself.
   The robber who looks not for pardon grows desperate; but, if he hopes
   for forgiveness, often comes to repentance.  What then, does the
   serpent cast its slough [507] , and shall not we cast off our sin?
   Thorny ground also, if cultivated well, is turned into fruitful; and is
   salvation to us irrecoverable?  Nay rather, our nature admits of
   salvation, but the will also is required.

   6.  God is loving to man, and loving in no small measure.  For say not,
   I have committed fornication and adultery:  I have done dreadful
   things, and not once only, but often:  will He forgive?  Will He grant
   pardon?  Hear what the Psalmist says:  How great is the multitude of
   Thy goodness, O Lord [508] !  Thine accumulated offences surpass not
   the multitude of God's mercies:  thy wounds surpass not the great
   Physician's skill.  Only give thyself up in faith:  tell the Physician
   thine ailment:  say thou also, like David:  I said, I will confess me
   my sin unto the Lord:  and the same shall be done in thy case, which he
   says forthwith:  And thou forgavest the wickedness of my heart [509] .

   7.  Wouldest thou see the loving-kindness of God, O thou that art
   lately come to the catechising?  Wouldest thou see the loving-kindness
   of God, and the abundance of His long-suffering?  Hear about Adam.
   Adam, God's first-formed man, transgressed:  could He not at once have
   brought death upon him?  But see what the Lord does, in His great love
   towards man.  He casts him out from Paradise, for because of sin he was
   unworthy to live there; but He puts him to dwell over against Paradise
   [510] :  that seeing whence he had fallen, and from what and into what
   a state he was brought down, he might afterwards be saved by
   repentance.  Cain the first-born man became his brother's murderer, the
   inventor of evils, the first author of murders, and the first envious
   man.  Yet after slaying his brother to what is he condemned?  Groaning
   and trembling shalt thou be upon the earth [511] .  How great the
   offence, the sentence how light!

   8.  Even this then was truly loving-kindness in God, but little as yet
   in comparison with what follows.  For consider what happened in the
   days of Noe.  The giants sinned, and much wickedness was then spread
   over the earth, and because of this the flood was to come upon them:
   and in the five hundredth year God utters His threatening; but in the
   six hundredth He brought the flood upon the earth.  Seest thou the
   breadth of God's loving-kindness extending to a hundred years?  Could
   He not have done immediately what He did then after the hundred years?
   But He extended (the time) on purpose, granting a respite for
   repentance.  Seest thou God's goodness?  And if the men of that time
   had repented, they would not have missed the loving-kindness of God.

   9.  Come with me now to the other class, those who were saved by
   repentance.  But perhaps even among women some one will say, I have
   committed fornication, and adultery, I have defiled my body by excesses
   of all kinds:  is there salvation for me?  Turn thine eyes, O woman,
   upon Rahab, and look thou also for salvation; for if she who had been
   openly and publicly a harlot was saved by repentance, is not she who on
   some one occasion before receiving grace committed fornication to be
   saved by repentance and fasting?  For inquire how she was saved:  this
   only she said:  For your God is God in heaven and upon earth [512] .
   Your God; for her own she did not dare to say, because of her wanton
   life.  And if you wish to receive Scriptural testimony of her having
   been saved, you have it written in the Psalms:  I will make mention of
   Rahab and Babylon among them that know me [513] .  O the greatness of
   God's loving-kindness, making mention even of harlots in the
   Scriptures:  nay, not simply I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon,
   but with the addition, among them that know me.  There is then in the
   case both of men and of women alike the salvation which is ushered in
   by repentance.

   10.  Nay more, if a whole people sin, this surpasses not the
   loving-kindness of God.  The people made a calf, yet God ceased not
   from His loving-kindness.  Men denied God, but God denied not Himself
   [514] .  These be thy gods, O Israel [515] , they said:  yet again, as
   He was wont, the God of Israel became their Saviour.  And not only the
   people sinned, but also Aaron the High Priest.  For it is Moses that
   says:  And the anger of the Lord came upon Aaron:  and I prayed for
   him, saith he, and God forgave him [516] .  What then, did Moses
   praying for a High Priest that sinned prevail with God, and shall not
   Jesus, His Only-begotten, prevail with God when He prays for us?  And
   if He did not hinder Aaron, because of his offence, from entering upon
   the High Priesthood, will He hinder thee, who art come out from the
   Gentiles, from entering into salvation?  Only, O man, repent thou also
   in like manner, and grace is not forbidden thee.  Render thy way of
   life henceforth unblameable; for God is truly loving unto man, nor can
   all time [517] worthily tell out His loving kindness; nay, not if all
   the tongues of men unite together will they be able even so to declare
   any considerable part of His loving-kindness.  For we tell some part of
   what is written concerning His loving-kindness to men, but how much He
   forgave the Angels we know not:  for them also He forgives, since One
   alone is without sin, even Jesus who purgeth our sins.  And of them we
   have said enough.

   11.  But if concerning us men thou wilt have other examples also set
   before thee [518] , come on to the blessed David, and take him for an
   example of repentance.  Great as he was, he fell:  after his sleep,
   walking in the eventide on the housetop, he cast a careless look, and
   felt a human passion.  His sin was completed, but there died not with
   it his candour concerning the confession of his fault.  Nathan the
   Prophet came, a swift accuser, and a healer of the wound.  The Lord is
   wroth, he says, and thou hast sinned [519] .  So spake the subject to
   the reigning king.  But David the king [520] was not indignant, for he
   regarded not the speaker, but God who had sent him.  He was not puffed
   up [521] by the array of soldiers standing round:  for he had seen in
   thought the angel-host of the Lord, and he trembled as seeing Him who
   is invisible [522] ; and to the messenger, or rather by him in answer
   to God who sent him, he said, I have sinned against the Lord [523] .
   Seest thou the humility of the king?  Seest thou his confession?  For
   had he been convicted by any one?  Were many privy to the matter?  The
   deed was quickly done, and straightway the Prophet appeared as accuser,
   and the offender confesses the fault.  And because he candidly
   confessed, he received a most speedy cure.  For Nathan the Prophet who
   had uttered the threat, said immediately, The Lord also hath put away
   thy sin.  Thou seest the swift relenting of a merciful God.  He says,
   however, Thou hast greatly provoked the enemies of the Lord.  Though
   thou hadst many enemies because of thy righteousness, thy self-control
   protected thee; but now that thou hast surrendered thy strongest
   armour, thine enemies are risen up, and stand ready against thee.

   12.  Thus then did the Prophet comfort him, but the blessed David, for
   all he heard it said, The Lord hath put away thy sin, did not cease
   from repentance, king though he was, but put on sackcloth instead of
   purple, and instead of a golden throne, he sat, a king, in ashes on the
   ground; nay, not only sat in ashes, but also had ashes for his food,
   even as he saith himself, I have eaten ashes as it were bread [524] .
   His lustful eye he wasted away with tears saying, Every night will I
   wash my couch, and water my bed with my tears [525] .  When his
   officers besought him to eat bread he would not listen.  He prolonged
   his fast unto seven whole days.  If a king thus made confession
   oughtest not thou, a private person, to confess?  Again, after
   Absalom's insurrection, though there were many roads for him to escape,
   he chose to flee by the Mount of Olives, in thought, as it were,
   invoking the Redeemer who was to go up thence into the heavens [526] .
   And when Shimei cursed him bitterly, he said, Let him alone, for he
   knew that "to him that forgiveth it shall be forgiven [527] ."

   13.  Thou seest that it is good to make confession.  Thou seest that
   there is salvation for them that repent.  Solomon also fell but what
   saith he?  Afterwards I repented [528] .  Ahab, too, the King of
   Samaria, became a most wicked idolater, an outrageous man, the murderer
   of the Prophets [529] , a stranger to godliness, a coveter of other
   men's fields and vineyards.  Yet when by Jezebel's means he had slain
   Naboth, and the Prophet Elias came and merely threatened him, he rent
   his garments, and put on sackcloth.  And what saith the merciful God to
   Elias?  Hast than seen how Ahab is pricked in the heart before Me [530]
   ? as if almost He would persuade the fiery zeal of the Prophet to
   condescend to the penitent.  For He saith, I will not bring the evil in
   his days.  And though after this forgiveness he was sure not to depart
   from his wickedness, nevertheless the forgiving God forgave him, not as
   being ignorant of the future, but as granting a forgiveness
   corresponding to his present season of repentance.  For it is the part
   of a righteous judge to give sentence according to each case that has
   occurred.

   14.  Again, Jeroboam was standing at the altar sacrificing to the
   idols:  his hand became withered, because he commanded the Prophet who
   reproved him to be seized:  but having by experience learned the power
   of the man before him, he says, Entreat the face of the Lord thy God
   [531] ; and because of this saying his hand was restored again.  If the
   Prophet healed Jeroboam, is Christ not able to heal and deliver thee
   from thy sins?  Manasses also was utterly wicked, who sawed Isaiah
   asunder [532] , and was defiled with all kinds of idolatries, and
   filled Jerusalem with innocent blood [533] ; but having been led
   captive to Babylon he used his experience of misfortune for a healing
   course of repentance:  for the Scripture saith that Manasses humbled
   himself before the Lord, and prayed, and the Lord heard him, and
   brought him back to his kingdom.  If He who sawed the Prophet asunder
   was saved by repentance, shall not thou then, having done no such great
   wickedness, be saved?

   15.  Take heed lest without reason thou mistrust the power of
   repentance.  Wouldst thou know what power repentance has?  Wouldst thou
   know the strong weapon of salvation, and learn what the force of
   confession is?  Hezekiah by means of confession routed a hundred and
   fourscore and five thousand of his enemies.  A great thing verily was
   this, but still small in comparison with what remains to be told:  the
   same king by repentance obtained the recall of a divine sentence which
   had already gone forth.  For when he had fallen sick, Esaias said to
   him, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live [534]
   .  What expectation remained, what hope of recovery, when the Prophet
   said, for thou shalt die?  Yet Hezekiah did not desist from repentance;
   but remembering what is written, When thou shalt turn and lament, then
   shalt thou be saved [535] , he turned to the wall, and from his bed
   lifting his mind to heaven (for thickness of walls is no hindrance to
   prayers sent up with devotion), he said, "Remember me, O Lord, for it
   is sufficient for my healing that Thou remember me.  Thou art not
   subject to times, but art Thyself the giver of the law of life.  For
   our life depends not on a nativity, nor on a conjunction of stars, as
   some idly talk; but both of life and its duration.  Then art Thyself
   the Lawgiver according to Thy Will."  And he, who could not hope to
   live because of the prophetic sentence, had fifteen years added to his
   life, and for the sign the sun ran backward in his course.  Well then,
   for Ezekias' sake the sun turned back but for Christ the sun was
   eclipsed, not retracing his steps, but suffering eclipse [536] , and
   therefore shewing the difference between them, I mean between Ezekias
   and Jesus.  The former prevailed to the cancelling of God's decree, and
   cannot Jesus grant remission of sins?  Turn and bewail thyself, shut
   thy door, and pray to be forgiven, pray that He may remove from thee
   the burning flames.  For confession has power to quench even fire,
   power to tame even lions [537] .

   16.  But if thou disbelieve, consider what befel Ananias and his
   companions.  What streams did they pour out [538] ?  How many vessels
   [539] of water could quench the flame that rose up forty-nine cubits
   high [540] ?  Nay, but where the flame mounted up a little [541] too
   high, faith was there poured out as a river, and there spake they the
   spell against all ills [542] :  Righteous art Thou, O Lord, in all the
   things that Thou hast done to us:  for we have sinned, and transgressed
   Thy law [543] .  And their repentance quelled the flames [544] .  If
   thou believest not that repentance is able to quench the fire of hell,
   learn it from what happened in regard to Ananias [545] .  But some keen
   hearer will say, Those men God rescued justly in that case:  because
   they refused to commit idolatry, God gave them that power.  And since
   this thought has occurred, I come next to a different example of
   penitence [546] .

   17.  What thinkest thou of Nabuchodonosor?  Hast thou not heard out of
   the Scriptures that he was bloodthirsty, fierce [547] , lion-like in
   disposition?  Hast thou not heard that he brought out the bones of the
   kings from their graves into the light [548] ?  Hast thou not heard
   [549] that he carried the people away captive?  Hast thou not heard
   that he put out the eyes of the king, after he had already seen his
   children slain [550] ?  Hast thou not heard that he brake in pieces
   [551] the Cherubim?  I do not mean the invisible [552] beings;--away
   with such a thought, O man [553] ,--but the sculptured images, and the
   mercy-seat, in the midst of which God spake with His voice [554] .  The
   veil of the Sanctuary [555] he trampled under foot:  the altar of
   incense he took and carried away to an idol-temple [556] :  all the
   offerings he took away:  the Temple he burned from the foundations
   [557] .  How great punishments did he deserve, for slaying kings, for
   setting fire to the Sanctuary, for taking the people captive, for
   setting the sacred vessels in the house of idols?  Did he not deserve
   ten thousand deaths?

   18.  Thou hast seen the greatness of his evil deeds:  come now to God's
   loving-kindness.  He was turned into a wild beast [558] , he abode in
   the wilderness, he was scourged, that he might be saved.  He had claws
   as a lion [559] ; for he was a ravager of the Sanctuary.  He had a
   lion's mane:  for he was a ravening and a roaring lion.  He ate grass
   like an ox:  for a brute beast he was, not knowing Him who had given
   him the kingdom.  His body was wet from the dew; because after seeing
   the fire quenched by the dew he believed not [560] .  And what happened
   [561] ?  After this, saith he, I, Nabuchodonosor, lifted up mine eyes
   unto heaven, and I blessed the Most High, and to Him that liveth for
   ever I gave praise and glory [562] .  When, therefore, he recognised
   the Most High [563] , and sent up these words of thankfulness to God,
   and repented himself for what he had done, and recognised his own
   weakness, then God gave back to him the honour of the kingdom.

   19.  What then [564] ?  When Nabuchodonosor, after having done such
   deeds, had made confession, did God give him pardon and the kingdom,
   and when thou repentest shall He not give thee the remission of sins,
   and the kingdom of heaven, if thou live a worthy life?  The Lord is
   loving unto man, and swift to pardon, but slow to punish.  Let no man
   therefore despair of his own salvation.  Peter, the chiefest and
   foremost of the Apostles, denied the Lord thrice before a little maid:
   but he repented himself, and wept bitterly.  Now weeping shews the
   repentance of the heart:  and therefore he not only received
   forgiveness for his denial, but also held his Apostolic dignity
   unforfeited.

   20.  Having therefore, brethren, many examples of those who have sinned
   and repented and been saved, do ye also heartily make confession unto
   the Lord, that ye may both receive the forgiveness of your former sins,
   and be counted worthy of the heavenly gift, and inherit the heavenly
   kingdom with all the saints in Christ Jesus; to Whom is the glory for
   ever and ever.  Amen [565] .

   [533] 2 Chron. xxxiii. 12, 13.

   [534] 2 Kings xx. 1.

   [535] Is. xxx. 15.

   [536] Isaiah xxxviii. 8.

   [537] From this point the mss. differ so widely that the Benedictine
   Editor gives two complete recensions of the whole Lecture.  The Codd.
   Coislin, Ottob. 2, and Grodec, with the editions of Prevot and Milles,
   forming as it were one family of mss., constitute the received text.
   On the other hand the older Munich Codex, with Codd. Roe and Casaubon,
   exhibit a recension of the Lecture differing from the editions.
   Reischl wishing to retain the received text unaltered, though
   preferring the other in particular passages, intended to append the
   other recension complete, but having left his work half finished,
   failed to do so.  The chief variations are given in the following
   notes.

   [538] Roe and Casaubon (R.C.) add:  "into the furnace of fire."

   [539] R.C. "What measure."

   [540] Song of the Three Children, v. 24.

   [541] R.C. "Much."

   [542] R.C. "A great stream of repentance was poured forth, when they
   said, For Thou art righteous," &c.

   [543] Song of the Three Children, v. 4.

   [544] R.C. "Did then repentance quench the flames of the furnace, and
   dost thou disbelieve that it is able also to quench the fire of hell?"

   [545] The Gospel only says, "There was darkness over all the land."  An
   eclipse of the sun was impossible at the time of the Paschal full moon.

   [546] R.C. "That the narrative is not appropriate to those who are here
   present.  For it was because Ananias and his companions refused to
   worship the idol, that God gave them that marvellous power.  Adapting
   myself, therefore, to such a hearer, and looking to the profusion of
   instances, I come next to a different example of repentance."

   [547] R.C. "most impious, and most fierce in temper."

   [548] Jer. viii. 1; Baruch ii. 25.

   [549] "Knowest thou not..."

   [550] 2 Kings xxv. 7.

   [551] R.C. "carried off."

   [552] noeta.  R.C. add "and heavenly."

   [553] Omitted by R.C.

   [554] R.C. "But those which had been constructed in the Temple, which
   were over the mercy-seat of the Ark."  Besides the two Cherubim of
   solid gold which Moses placed on the two ends of the Mercy-seat (Ex.
   xxxvii. 7 ff.), Solomon set "within the oracle" two Cherubim of olive
   wood overlaid with gold, ten feet high with outstretched wings
   overshadowing the Ark (1 Kings vi. 23-26; viii. 6, 7).  All these were
   either carried off or destroyed, when Nebuchadnezzar took away "all the
   treasures of the house of the Lord" and "cut in pieces all the vessels
   of gold which Solomon, King of Israel, had made in the Temple of the
   Lord" (2 Kings xxiv. 13; 1 Esdras i. 54; 2 Esdras x. 22).  The
   Benedictine editor is concerned because Cyril has paid no attention to
   the strange fiction in 2 Maccabees ii. 4 that Jeremy the Prophet
   "commanded the Tabernacle and the Ark to go with him" to Mount Horeb,
   and there hid them, with the Altar of Incense, in a hollow cave, to
   remain "unknown until the time that God gathers His people again
   together."

   [555] The Greek word rendered "Sanctuary" is he hagiosune, literally
   "the holiness."

   [556] 2 Chron. xxxvi. 7.

   [557] R.C. "The veil of the Sanctuary he tore down, he overturned the
   altar, and took all the vessels and carried them away to an idol
   temple.  The Temple itself he burned."

   [558] R.C. Afterwards he was turned into a wild beast:  "he who was
   like a wild beast and most cruel in disposition; but he was turned into
   a wild beast, not that he might perish, but that by repentance he might
   be saved."

   [559] R.C. "of birds."  See Dan. iv. 33.

   [560] R.C. "after the midst of the furnace had become to Ananias and
   his companions as the tinkling breath of rain, he saw and believed
   not."

   [561] R.C. "But afterwards he came to his senses and repented, as he
   says himself."

   [562] Dan. iv. 34.

   [563] R.C. "And after he had been scourged many years, he gave praise
   to Him that liveth for ever, and acknowledged Him that had given him
   the kingdom, and recognised the King of kings.  And though he had often
   sinned in deeds, on making confession only in words, he received the
   benefit of God's unspeakable loving kindness.  He who was of all men
   most wicked, by the Divine judgment and loving-kindness of God who
   chastised him, crowned himself again with the royal diadem, and
   recovered his imperial throne."

   [564] R.C. "If then there is present among you any from among the
   Heathen who has ever spoken evil against Christians, or in times of
   persecution plotted against the Holy Churches, let him take
   Nabuchodonsor as an example of salvation:  let him confess in like
   manner, that he may also find the like forgiveness.  If any has been
   defiled by lust and passions, let him take up the repentance of the
   blessed David:  if any has denied like Peter, let him die like him for
   the sake of the Lord Jesus.  For He who to his tears begrudged not the
   Apostleship, will not refuse thee the gospel mysteries.  And for women
   let Rahab be a pattern unto salvation, and for men the manifold
   examples mentioned of the men of old times.

   [565] R.C. "And be ye all of good hope, having regard to the
   lovingkindness of God; not that we may fall back into the same sins,
   but that having had the benefit of redemption, and lived in a manner
   worthy of His grace, we may be able to blot out the handwriting that is
   against us by good works; in the power of the Only-begotten, the Son of
   God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the Father, with
   the Holy Ghost, both now and ever, and unto all the ages of eternity.
   Amen."

   Lecture III.

   On Baptism.

   Romans vi. 3, 4

   Or know ye not that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were
   baptized into His death? were buried therefore with Him by our baptism
   into death, &c.

   1.  Rejoice, ye heavens, and let the earth be glad [566] , for those
   who are to be sprinkled with hyssop, and cleansed with the spiritual
   [567] hyssop, the power of Him to whom at His Passion drink was offered
   on hyssop and a reed [568] .  And while the Heavenly Powers rejoice,
   let the souls that are to be united to the spiritual Bridegroom make
   themselves ready.  For the voice is heard of one crying in the
   wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord [569] .  For this is no
   light matter, no ordinary and indiscriminate union according to the
   flesh [570] , but the All-searching Spirit's election according to
   faith.  For the inter-marriages and contracts of the world are not made
   altogether with judgment:  but wherever there is wealth or beauty,
   there the bridegroom speedily approves:  but here it is not beauty of
   person, but the soul's clear conscience; not the condemned Mammon, but
   the wealth of the soul in godliness.

   2.  Listen then, O ye children of righteousness, to John's exhortation
   when he says, Make straight the way of the Lord.  Take away all
   obstacles and stumbling-blocks, that ye may walk straight onward to
   eternal life.  Make ready the vessels [571] of the soul, cleansed by
   unfeigned faith, for reception of the Holy Ghost.  Begin at once to
   wash your robes in repentance, that when called to the bride-chamber ye
   may be found clean.  For the Bridegroom invites all without
   distinction, because His grace is bounteous; and the cry of loud-voiced
   heralds assembles them all:  but the same Bridegroom afterwards
   separates those who have come in to the figurative marriage.  O may
   none of those whose names have now been enrolled hear the words,
   Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment [572]
   ?  But may you all hear, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
   wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things:
   enter thou into the joy of thy lord [573] .

   For now meanwhile thou standest outside the door:  but God grant that
   you all may say, The King hath brought me into His chamber [574] .  Let
   my soul rejoice in the Lord:  for He hath clothed me with a garment of
   salvation, and a robe of gladness:  He hath crowned me with a garland
   as a bridegroom [575] , and decked me with ornaments as a bride:  that
   the soul of every one of you may be found not having spot or wrinkle or
   any such thing [576] ; I do not mean before you have received the
   grace, for how could that be? since it is for remission of sins that ye
   have been called; but that, when the grace is to be given, your
   conscience being found uncondemned may concur with the grace.

   3.  This is in truth a serious matter, brethren, and you must approach
   it with good heed.  Each one of you is about to be presented to God
   before tens of thousands of the Angelic Hosts:  the Holy Ghost is about
   to seal [577] your souls:  ye are to be enrolled in the army of the
   Great King.  Therefore make you ready, and equip yourselves, by putting
   on I mean, not bright apparel [578] , but piety of soul with a good
   conscience.  Regard not the Laver as simple water, but rather regard
   the spiritual grace that is given with the water.  For just as the
   offerings brought to the heathen altars [579] , though simple in their
   nature, become defiled by the invocation of the idols [580] , so
   contrariwise the simple water having received the invocation of the
   Holy Ghost, and of Christ, and of the Father, acquires a new power of
   holiness.

   4.  For since man is of twofold nature, soul and body, the purification
   also is twofold, the one incorporeal for the incorporeal part, and the
   other bodily for the body:  the water cleanses the body, and the Spirit
   seals the soul; that we may draw near unto God, having our heart
   sprinkled by the Spirit, and our body washed with pure water [581] .
   When going down, therefore, into the water, think not of the bare
   element, but look for salvation by the power of the Holy Ghost:  for
   without both thou canst not possibly be made perfect [582] .  It is not
   I that say this, but the Lord Jesus Christ, who has the power in this
   matter:  for He saith, Except a man be born anew (and He adds the
   words) of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
   God [583] .  Neither doth he that is baptized with water, but not found
   worthy of the Spirit, receive the grace in perfection; nor if a man be
   virtuous in his deeds, but receive not the seal by water, shall he
   enter into the kingdom of heaven.  A bold saying, but not mine, for it
   is Jesus who hath declared it:  and here is the proof of the statement
   from Holy Scripture.  Cornelius was a just man, who was honoured with a
   vision of Angels, and had set up his prayers and alms-deeds as a good
   memorial [584] before God in heaven.  Peter came, and the Spirit was
   poured out upon them that believed, and they spake with other tongues,
   and prophesied:  and after the grace of the Spirit the Scripture saith
   that Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
   [585] ; in order that, the soul having been born again by faith [586] ,
   the body also might by the water partake of the grace.

   5.  But if any one wishes to know why the grace is given by water and
   not by a different element, let him take up the Divine Scriptures and
   he shall learn.  For water is a grand thing, and the noblest of the
   four visible elements of the world.  Heaven is the dwelling-place of
   Angels, but the heavens are from the waters [587] :  the earth is the
   place of men, but the earth is from the waters:  and before the whole
   six days' formation of the things that were made, the Spirit of God
   moved upon the face of the water [588] .  The water was the beginning
   of the world, and Jordan the beginning of the Gospel tidings:  for
   Israel deliverance from Pharaoh was through the sea, and for the world
   deliverance from sins by the washing of water with the word [589] of
   God.  Where a covenant is made with any, there is water also.  After
   the flood, a covenant was made with Noah:  a covenant for Israel from
   Mount Sinai, but with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop [590] .
   Elias is taken up, but not apart from water:  for first he crosses the
   Jordan, then in a chariot mounts the heaven.  The high-priest is first
   washed, then offers incense; for Aaron first washed, then was made
   high-priest:  for how could one who had not yet been purified by water
   pray for the rest?  Also as a symbol of Baptism there was a laver set
   apart within the Tabernacle.

   6.  Baptism is the end of the Old Testament, and beginning of the New.
   For its author was John, than whom was none greater among them that are
   born of women.  The end he was of the Prophets:  for all the Prophets
   and the law were until John [591] :  but of the Gospel history he was
   the first-fruit.  For it saith, The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ, &c.:  John came baptising in the wilderness [592] .  You may
   mention Elias the Tishbite who was taken up into heaven, yet he is not
   greater than John:  Enoch was translated, but he is not greater than
   John:  Moses was a very great lawgiver, and all the Prophets were
   admirable, but not greater than John.  It is not I that dare to compare
   Prophets with Prophets:  but their Master and ours, the Lord Jesus,
   declared it:  Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a
   greater than John [593] :  He saith not "among them that are born of
   virgins," but of women [594] .  The comparison is between the great
   servant and his fellow-servants:  but the pre-eminence and the grace of
   the Son is beyond comparison with servants.  Seest thou how great a man
   God chose as the first minister of this grace?--a man possessing
   nothing, and a lover of the desert, yet no hater of mankind:  who ate
   locusts, and winged his soul for heaven [595] :  feeding upon honey,
   and speaking things both sweeter and more salutary than honey:  clothed
   with a garment of camel's hair, and shewing in himself the pattern of
   the ascetic life; who also was sanctified by the Holy Ghost while yet
   he was carried in his mother's womb.  Jeremiah was sanctified, but did
   not prophesy, in the womb [596] :  John alone while carried in the womb
   leaped for joy [597] , and though he saw not with the eyes of flesh,
   knew his Master by the Spirit:  for since the grace of Baptism was
   great, it required greatness in its founder also.

   7.  This man was baptizing in Jordan, and there went out unto him all
   Jerusalem [598] , to enjoy the first-fruits of baptisms:  for in
   Jerusalem is the prerogative of all things good.  But learn, O ye
   inhabitants of Jerusalem, how they that came out were baptized by him:
   confessing their sins, it is said [599] .  First they shewed their
   wounds, then he applied the remedies, and to them that believed gave
   redemption from eternal fire.  And if thou wilt be convinced of this
   very point, that the baptism of John is a redemption from the threat of
   the fire, hear how he says, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you
   to flee from the wrath to come [600] ?  Be not then henceforth a viper,
   but as thou hast been formerly a viper's brood, put off, saith he, the
   slough [601] of thy former sinful life.  For every serpent creeps into
   a hole and casts its old slough, and having rubbed off the old skin,
   grows young again in body.  In like manner enter thou also through the
   strait and narrow gate [602] :  rub off thy former self by fasting, and
   drive out that which is destroying thee.  Put off the old man with his
   doings [603] , and quote that saying in the Canticles, I have put off
   my coat, how shall I put it on [604] ?

   But there is perhaps among you some hypocrite, a man-pleaser, and one
   who makes a pretence of piety, but believes not from the heart; having
   the hypocrisy of Simon Magus; one who has come hither not in order to
   receive of the grace, but to spy out what is given:  let him also learn
   from John:  And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees,
   Every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
   and cast into the fire [605] .  The Judge is inexorable; put away thine
   hypocrisy.

   8.  What then must you do?  And what are the fruits of repentance?  Let
   him that hath two coats give to him that hath none [606] :  the teacher
   was worthy of credit, since he was also the first to practise what he
   taught:  he was not ashamed to speak, for conscience hindered not his
   tongue:  and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.  Wouldst thou
   enjoy the grace of the Holy Spirit, yet judgest the poor not worthy of
   bodily food?  Seekest thou the great gifts, and impartest not of the
   small?  Though thou be a publican, or a fornicator, have hope of
   salvation:  the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God
   before you [607] .  Paul also is witness, saying, Neither fornicators,
   nor adulterers, nor the rest, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  And
   such were some of you:  but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified
   [608] .  He said not, such are some of you, but such were some of you.
   Sin committed in the state of ignorance is pardoned, but persistent
   wickedness is condemned.

   9.  Thou hast as the glory of Baptism the Son Himself, the
   Only-begotten of God.  For why should I speak any more of man?  John
   was great, but what is he to the Lord?  His was a loud-sounding voice,
   but what in comparison with the Word?  Very noble was the herald, but
   what in comparison with the King?  Noble was he that baptized with
   water, but what to Him that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and with fire
   [609] ?  The Saviour baptized the Apostles with the Holy Ghost and with
   fire, when suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of the rushing of
   a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
   And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire:  and it
   sat upon each one of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
   [610] .

   10.  If any man receive not Baptism, he hath not salvation; except only
   Martyrs, who even without the water receive the kingdom.  For when the
   Saviour, in redeeming the world by His Cross, was pierced in the side,
   He shed forth blood and water; that men, living in times of peace,
   might be baptized in water, and, in times of persecution, in their own
   blood.  For martyrdom also the Saviour is wont to call a baptism,
   saying, Can ye drink the cup which I drink, and be baptized with the
   baptism that I am baptized with [611] ?  And the Martyrs confess, by
   being made a spectacle unto the world, and to Angels, and to men [612]
   ; and thou wilt soon confess:--but it is not yet the time for thee to
   hear of this.

   11.  Jesus sanctified Baptism by being Himself baptized.  If the Son of
   God was baptized, what godly man is he that despiseth Baptism?  But He
   was baptized not that He might receive remission of sins, for He was
   sinless; but being sinless, He was baptized, that He might give to them
   that are baptized a divine and excellent grace.  For since the children
   are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of
   the same [613] , that having been made partakers of His presence in the
   flesh we might be made partakers also of His Divine grace:  thus Jesus
   was baptized, that thereby we again by our participation might receive
   both salvation and honour.  According to Job, there was in the waters
   the dragon that draweth up Jordan into his mouth [614] .  Since,
   therefore, it was necessary to break the heads of the dragon in pieces
   [615] , He went down and bound the strong one in the waters, that we
   might receive power to tread upon serpents and scorpions [616] .  The
   beast was great and terrible.  No fishing-vessel was able to carry one
   scale of his tail [617] :  destruction ran before him [618] , ravaging
   all that met him.  The Life encountered him, that the mouth of Death
   might henceforth be stopped, and all we that are saved might say, O
   death, where is thy sting?  O grave, where is thy victory [619] ?  The
   sting of death is drawn by Baptism.

   12.  For thou goest down into the water, bearing thy sins, but the
   invocation of grace [620] , having sealed thy soul, suffereth thee not
   afterwards to be swallowed up by the terrible dragon.  Having gone down
   dead in sins, thou comest up quickened in righteousness.  For if thou
   hast been united with the likeness of the Saviour's death [621] , thou
   shalt also be deemed worthy of His Resurrection.  For as Jesus took
   upon Him the sins of the world, and died, that by putting sin to death
   He might rise again in righteousness; so thou by going down into the
   water, and being in a manner buried in the waters, as He was in the
   rock, art raised again walking in newness of life [622] .

   13.  Moreover, when thou hast been deemed worthy of the grace, He then
   giveth thee strength to wrestle against the adverse powers.  For as
   after His Baptism He was tempted forty days (not that He was unable to
   gain the victory before, but because He wished to do all things in due
   order and succession), so thou likewise, though not daring before thy
   baptism to wrestle with the adversaries, yet after thou hast received
   the grace and art henceforth confident in the armour of righteousness
   [623] , must then do battle, and preach the Gospel, if thou wilt.

   14.  Jesus Christ was the Son of God, yet He preached not the Gospel
   before His Baptism.  If the Master Himself followed the right time in
   due order, ought we, His servants, to venture out of order?  From that
   time Jesus began to preach [624] , when the Holy Spirit had descended
   upon Him in a bodily shape, like a dove [625] ; not that Jesus might
   see Him first, for He knew Him even before He came in a bodily shape,
   but that John, who was baptizing Him, might behold Him.  For I, saith
   he, knew Him not:  but He that sent me to baptize with water, He said
   unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and
   abiding on Him, that is He [626] .  If thou too hast unfeigned piety,
   the Holy Ghost cometh down on thee also, and a Father's voice sounds
   over thee from on high--not, "This is My Son," but, "This has now been
   made My son;" for the "is" belongs to Him alone, because In the
   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
   [627] .  To Him belongs the "is," since He is always the Son of God:
   but to thee "has now been made:"  since thou hast not the sonship by
   nature, but receivest it by adoption.  He eternally "is;" but thou
   receivest the grace by advancement.

   15.  Make ready then the vessel of thy soul, that thou mayest become a
   son of God, and an heir of God, and joint-heir with Christ [628] ; if,
   indeed, thou art preparing thyself that thou mayest receive; if thou
   art drawing nigh in faith that thou mayest be made faithful; if of set
   purpose thou art putting off the old man.  For all things whatsoever
   thou hast done shall be forgiven thee, whether it be fornication, or
   adultery, or any other such form of licentiousness.  What can be a
   greater sin than to crucify Christ?  Yet even of this Baptism can
   purify.  For so spake Peter to the three thousand who came to him, to
   those who had crucified the Lord, when they asked him, saying, Men and
   brethren, what shall we do [629] ?  For the wound is great.  Thou hast
   made us think of our fall, O Peter, by saying, Ye killed the Prince of
   Life [630] .  What salve is there for so great a wound?  What cleansing
   for such foulness?  What is the salvation for such perdition?  Repent,
   saith he, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
   our Lord, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
   the Holy Ghost [631] .  O unspeakable loving-kindness of God!  They
   have no hope of being saved, and yet they are thought worthy of the
   Holy Ghost.  Thou seest the power of Baptism!  If any of you has
   crucified the Christ by blasphemous words; if any of you in ignorance
   has denied Him before men; if any by wicked works has caused the
   doctrine to be blasphemed; let him repent and be of good hope, for the
   same grace is present even now.

   16.  Be of good courage, O Jerusalem; the Lord will take away all thine
   iniquities [632] .  The Lord will wash away the filth of His sons and
   of His daughters by the Spirit of judgment, and by the Spirit of
   burning [633] .  He will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
   cleansed from all your sin [634] .  Angels shall dance around you, and
   say, Who is this that cometh up in white array, leaning upon her
   beloved [635] ?  For the soul that was formerly a slave has now adopted
   her Master Himself as her kinsman:  and He accepting the unfeigned
   purpose will answer:  Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art
   fair:  thy teeth are like flocks of sheep new shorn, (because of the
   confession of a good conscience:  and further) which have all of them
   twins [636] ; because of the twofold grace, I mean that which is
   perfected of water and of the Spirit [637] , or that which is announced
   by the Old and by the New Testament.  And God grant that all of you
   when you have finished the course of the fast, may remember what I say,
   and bringing forth fruit in good works, may stand blameless beside the
   Spiritual Bridegroom, and obtain the remission of your sins from God;
   to whom with the Son and Holy Spirit be the glory for ever.  Amen.

   [567] The invisible or spiritual (noetos) hyssop is the cleansing power
   of the Holy Ghost in Baptism.  Compare Ps. li. 7.

   [568] S. Cyril here, and still more emphatically in xiii. 39,
   distinguishes the hyssop (John xix. 29) from the reed (Matt. xxvii.
   48), implying that the sponge filled with vinegar was bound round with
   hyssop, and then fixed on a reed.  Another opinion is that the reed
   itself was that of hyssop.  See Dictionary of the Bible, "Hyssop."

   Baptism is found in the Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 43:  "Look down
   from heaven, and sanctify this water, and give it grace and power, that
   so he that is to be baptized according to the command of Thy Christ,
   may be crucified with Him, and may die with Him, and be buried with
   Him, and may rise with him to the adoption which is in him, that he may
   be dead to sin and live to righteousness."

   inasmuch as Jesus Himself declared that John was greater than all men,
   and all Prophets.  The answer is there given, that John was greater
   than all who are born of women, yet not greater than the Son of Man.

   [637] The Fathers sometimes speak as if Baptism was primarily the
   Sacrament of remission of sins, and upon that came the gift of the
   Spirit, which notwithstanding was but begun in Baptism and completed in
   Confirmation.  Vid. Tertullian. de Bapt. 7, 8, supr. i. 5 fin.  Hence,
   as in the text, Baptism may be said to be made up of two gifts, Water,
   which is Christ's blood, and the Spirit.  There is no real difference
   between this and the ordinary way of speaking on the subject;--Water,
   which conveys both gifts, is considered as a type of one
   especially,--conveys both remission of sins through Christ's blood and
   the grace of the Spirit, but is the type of one, viz. the blood of
   Christ, as the Oil in Confirmation is of the other.  And again,
   remission of sins is a complete gift given at once, sanctification an
   increasing one.  (R.W.C.)  See Index, "Baptism."

   Lecture IV.

   On the Ten [638] Points of Doctrine.

   Colossians ii. 8.

   Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after
   the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, &c.

   1.  Vice mimics virtue, and the tares strive to be thought wheat,
   growing like the wheat in appearance, but being detected by good judges
   from the taste.  The devil also transfigures himself into an angel of
   light [639] ; not that he may reascend to where he was, for having made
   his heart hard as an anvil [640] , he has henceforth a will that cannot
   repent; but in order that he may envelope those who are living an
   Angelic life in a mist of blindness, and a pestilent condition of
   unbelief.  Many wolves are going about in sheeps' clothing [641] ,
   their clothing being that of sheep, not so their claws and teeth:  but
   clad in their soft skin, and deceiving the innocent by their
   appearance, they shed upon them from their fangs the destructive poison
   of ungodliness.  We have need therefore of divine grace, and of a sober
   mind, and of eyes that see, lest from eating tares as wheat we suffer
   harm from ignorance, and lest from taking the wolf to be a sheep we
   become his prey, and from supposing the destroying Devil to be a
   beneficent Angel we be devoured:  for, as the Scripture saith, he goeth
   about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour [642] .  This is
   the cause of the Church's admonitions, the cause of the present
   instructions, and of the lessons which are read.

   2.  For the method of godliness consists of these two things, pious
   doctrines, and virtuous practice:  and neither are the doctrines
   acceptable to God apart from good works, nor does God accept the works
   which are not perfected with pious doctrines.  For what profit is it,
   to know well the doctrines concerning God, and yet to be a vile
   fornicator?  And again, what profit is it, to be nobly temperate, and
   an impious blasphemer?  A most precious possession therefore is the
   knowledge of doctrines:  also there is need of a wakeful soul, since
   there are many that make spoil through philosophy and vain deceit [643]
   .  The Greeks on the one hand draw men away by their smooth tongue, for
   honey droppeth from a harlot's lips [644] :  whereas they of the
   Circumcision deceive those who come to them by means of the Divine
   Scriptures, which they miserably misinterpret though studying them from
   childhood to old age [645] , and growing old in ignorance.  But the
   children of heretics, by their good words and smooth tongue, deceive
   the hearts of the innocent [646] , disguising with the name of Christ
   as it were with honey the poisoned arrows [647] of their impious
   doctrines:  concerning all of whom together the Lord saith, Take heed
   lest any man mislead you [648] .  This is the reason for the teaching
   of the Creed and for expositions upon it.

   3.  But before delivering you over to the Creed [649] , I think it is
   well to make use at present of a short summary of necessary doctrines;
   that the multitude of things to be spoken, and the long interval of the
   days of all this holy Lent, may not cause forgetfulness in the mind of
   the more simple among you; but that, having strewn some seeds now in a
   summary way, we may not forget the same when afterwards more widely
   tilled.  But let those here present whose habit of mind is mature, and
   who have their senses already exercised to discern good and evil [650]
   , endure patiently to listen to things fitted rather for children, and
   to an introductory course, as it were, of milk:  that at the same time
   both those who have need of the instruction may be benefited, and those
   who have the knowledge may rekindle the remembrance of things which
   they already know.

   I.  Of God.

   4.  First then let there be laid as a foundation in your soul the
   doctrine concerning God; that God is One, alone unbegotten, without
   beginning, change, or variation [651] ; neither begotten of another,
   nor having another to succeed Him in His life; who neither began to
   live in time, nor endeth ever:  and that He is both good and just; that
   if ever thou hear a heretic say, that there is one God who is just, and
   another who is good [652] , thou mayest immediately remember, and
   discern the poisoned arrow of heresy.  For some have impiously dared to
   divide the One God in their teaching:  and some have said that one is
   the Creator and Lord of the soul, and another of the body [653] ; a
   doctrine at once absurd and impious.  For how can a man become the one
   servant of two masters, when our Lord says in the Gospels, No man can
   serve two masters [654] ?  There is then One Only God, the Maker both
   of souls and bodies:  One the Creator of heaven and earth, the Maker of
   Angels and Archangels:  of many the Creator, but of One only the Father
   before all ages,--of One only, His Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus
   Christ, by Whom He made all things visible and invisible [655] .

   5.  This Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is not circumscribed in any
   place [656] , nor is He less than the heaven; but the heavens are the
   works of His fingers [657] , and the whole earth is held in His grasp
   [658] :  He is in all things and around all.  Think not that the sun is
   brighter than He [659] , or equal to Him:  for He who at first formed
   the sun must needs be incomparably greater and brighter.  He
   foreknoweth the things that shall be, and is mightier than all, knowing
   all things and doing as He will; not being subject to any necessary
   sequence of events, nor to nativity, nor chance, nor fate; in all
   things perfect, and equally possessing every absolute form [660] of
   virtue, neither diminishing nor increasing, but in mode and conditions
   ever the same; who hath prepared punishment for sinners, and a crown
   for the righteous.

   6.  Seeing then that many have gone astray in divers ways from the One
   God, some having deified the sun, that when the sun sets they may abide
   in the night season without God; others the moon, to have no God by day
   [661] ; others the other parts of the world [662] ; others the arts
   [663] ; others their various kinds of food [664] ; others their
   pleasures [665] ; while some, mad after women, have set up on high an
   image of a naked woman, and called it Aphrodite [666] , and worshipped
   their own lust in a visible form; and others dazzled by the brightness
   of gold have deified it [667] and the other kinds of matter;--whereas
   if one lay as a first foundation in his heart the doctrine of the unity
   [668] of God, and trust to Him, he roots out at once the whole crop
   [669] of the evils of idolatry, and of the error of the heretics:  lay
   thou, therefore, this first doctrine of religion as a foundation in thy
   soul by faith.

   Of Christ.

   7.  Believe also in the Son of God, One and Only, our Lord Jesus
   Christ, Who was begotten God of God, begotten Life of Life, begotten
   Light of Light [670] , Who is in all things like [671] to Him that
   begat, Who received not His being in time, but was before all ages
   eternally and incomprehensibly begotten of the Father:  The Wisdom and
   the Power of God, and His Righteousness personally subsisting [672] :
   Who sitteth on the right hand of the Father before all ages.

   For the throne at God's right hand He received not, as some have
   thought, because of His patient endurance, being crowned as it were by
   God after His Passion; but throughout His being,--a being by eternal
   generation [673] ,--He holds His royal dignity, and shares the Father's
   seat, being God and Wisdom and Power, as hath been said; reigning
   together with the Father, and creating all things for the Father, yet
   lacking nothing in the dignity of Godhead, and knowing Him that hath
   begotten Him, even as He is known of Him that hath begotten; and to
   speak briefly, remember thou what is written in the Gospels, that none
   knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any the Father save the
   Son [674] .

   8.  Further, do thou neither separate [675] the Son from the Father,
   nor by making a confusion believe in a Son-Fatherhood [676] ; but
   believe that of One God there is One Only-begotten Son, who is before
   all ages God the Word; not the uttered [677] word diffused into the
   air, nor to be likened to impersonal words [678] ; but the Word the
   Son, Maker of all who partake of reason, the Word who heareth the
   Father, and Himself speaketh.  And on these points, should God permit,
   we will speak more at large in due season; for we do not forget our
   present purpose to give a summary introduction to the Faith.

   Concerning His Birth of the Virgin.

   9.  Believe then that this Only-begotten Son of God for our sins came
   down from heaven upon earth, and took upon Him this human nature of
   like passions [679] with us, and was begotten of the Holy Virgin and of
   the Holy Ghost, and was made Man, not in seeming and mere show [680] ,
   but in truth; nor yet by passing through the Virgin as through a
   channel [681] ; but was of her made truly flesh, [and truly nourished
   with milk [682] ], and did truly eat as we do, and truly drink as we
   do.  For if the Incarnation was a phantom, salvation is a phantom
   also.  The Christ was of two natures, Man in what was seen, but God in
   what was not seen; as Man truly eating like us, for He had the like
   feeling of the flesh with us; but as God feeding the five thousand from
   five loaves; as Man truly dying, but as God raising him that had been
   dead four days; truly sleeping in the ship as Man, and walking upon the
   waters as God.

   Of the Cross.

   10.  He was truly crucified for our sins.  For if thou wouldest deny
   it, the place refutes thee visibly, this blessed Golgotha [683] , in
   which we are now assembled for the sake of Him who was here crucified;
   and the whole world has since been filled with pieces of the wood of
   the Cross [684] .  But He was crucified not for sins of His own, but
   that we might be delivered from our sins.  And though as Man He was at
   that time despised of men, and was buffeted, yet He was acknowledged by
   the Creation as God:  for when the sun saw his Lord dishonoured, he
   grew dim and trembled, not enduring the sight.

   Of His Burial.

   11.  He was truly laid as Man in a tomb of rock; but rocks were rent
   asunder by terror because of Him.  He went down into the regions
   beneath the earth, that thence also He might redeem the righteous [685]
   .  For, tell me, couldst thou wish the living only to enjoy His grace,
   and that, though most of them are unholy; and not wish those who from
   Adam had for a long while been imprisoned to have now gained their
   liberty?  Esaias the Prophet proclaimed with loud voice so many things
   concerning Him; wouldst thou not wish that the King should go down and
   redeem His herald?  David was there, and Samuel, and all the Prophets
   [686] , John himself also, who by his messengers said, Art thou He that
   should come, or look we for another [687] ?  Wouldst thou not wish that
   He should descend and redeem such as these?

   Of the Resurrection.

   12.  But He who descended into the regions beneath the earth came up
   again; and Jesus, who was buried, truly rose again the third day.  And
   if the Jews ever worry thee, meet them at once by asking thus:  Did
   Jonah come forth from the whale on the third day, and hath not Christ
   then risen from the earth on the third day?  Is a dead man raised to
   life on touching the bones of Elisha, and is it not much easier for the
   Maker of mankind to be raised by the power of the Father?  Well then,
   He truly rose, and after He had risen was seen again of the disciples:
   and twelve disciples were witnesses of His Resurrection, who bare
   witness not in pleasing words, but contended even unto torture and
   death for the truth of the Resurrection.  What then, shall every word
   be established at the mouth of two of three witnesses [688] , according
   to the Scripture, and, though twelve bear witness to the Resurrection
   of Christ, art thou still incredulous in regard to His Resurrection?

   Concerning the Ascension.

   13.  But when Jesus had finished His course of patient endurance, and
   had redeemed mankind from their sins, He ascended again into the
   heavens, a cloud receiving Him up:  and as He went up Angels were
   beside Him, and Apostles were beholding.  But if any man disbelieves
   the words which I speak, let him believe the actual power of the things
   now seen.  All kings when they die have their power extinguished with
   their life:  but Christ crucified is worshipped by the whole world.  We
   proclaim The Crucified, and the devils tremble now.  Many have been
   crucified at various times; but of what other who was crucified did the
   invocation ever drive the devils away?

   14.  Let us, therefore, not be ashamed of the Cross of Christ; but
   though another hide it, do thou openly seal it upon thy forehead, that
   the devils may behold the royal sign and flee trembling far away [689]
   .  Make then this sign at eating and drinking, at sitting, at lying
   down, at rising up, at speaking, at walking:  in a word, at every act
   [690] .  For He who was here crucified is in heaven above.  If after
   being crucified and buried He had remained in the tomb, we should have
   had cause to be ashamed; but, in fact, He who was crucified on Golgotha
   here, has ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives on the East.
   For after having gone down hence into Hades, and come up again to us,
   He ascended again from us into heaven, His Father addressing Him, and
   saying, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
   footstool [691] .

   Of Judgment to Come.

   15.  This Jesus Christ who is gone up shall come again, not from earth
   but from heaven:  and I say, "not from earth," because there are many
   Antichrists to come at this time from earth.  For already, as thou hast
   seen, many have begun to say, I am the Christ [692] :  and the
   abomination of desolation [693] is yet to come, assuming to himself the
   false title of Christ.  But look thou for the true Christ, the
   Only-begotten Son of God, coming henceforth no more from earth, but
   from heaven, appearing to all more bright than any lightning and
   brilliancy of light, with angel guards attended, that He may judge both
   quick and dead, and reign in a heavenly, eternal kingdom, which shall
   have no end.  For on this point also, I pray thee, make thyself sure,
   since there are many who say that Christ's Kingdom hath an end [694] .

   Of the Holy Ghost.

   16.  Believe thou also in the Holy Ghost, and hold the same opinion
   concerning Him, which thou hast received to hold concerning the Father
   and the Son, and follow not those who teach blasphemous things of Him
   [695] .  But learn thou that this Holy Spirit is One, indivisible, of
   manifold power; having many operations, yet not Himself divided; Who
   knoweth the mysteries, Who searcheth all things, even the deep things
   of God [696] :  Who descended upon the Lord Jesus Christ in form of a
   dove; Who wrought in the Law and in the Prophets; Who now also at the
   season of Baptism sealeth thy soul; of Whose holiness also every
   intellectual nature hath need:  against Whom if any dare to blaspheme,
   he hath no forgiveness, neither in this world, nor in that which is to
   come [697] :  "Who with the Father and the Son together [698] " is
   honoured with the glory of the Godhead:  of Whom also thrones, and
   dominions, principalities, and powers have need [699] .  For there is
   One God, the Father of Christ; and One Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Only-begotten Son of the Only God; and One Holy Ghost, the sanctifier
   and deifier of all [700] , Who spake in the Law and in the Prophets, in
   the Old and in the New Testament.

   17.  Have thou ever in thy mind this seal [701] , which for the present
   has been lightly touched in my discourse, by way of summary, but shall
   be stated, should the Lord permit, to the best of my power with the
   proof from the Scriptures.  For concerning the divine and holy
   mysteries of the Faith, not even a casual statement must be delivered
   without the Holy Scriptures; nor must we be drawn aside by mere
   plausibility and artifices of speech.  Even to me, who tell thee these
   things, give not absolute credence, unless thou receive the proof of
   the things which I announce from the Divine Scriptures.  For this
   salvation which we believe depends not on ingenious reasoning [702] ,
   but on demonstration of the Holy Scriptures.

   Of the Soul.

   18.  Next to the knowledge of this venerable and glorious and all-holy
   Faith, learn further what thou thyself art:  that as man thou art of a
   two-fold nature, consisting of soul and body; and that, as was said a
   short time ago, the same God is the Creator both of soul and body [703]
   .  Know also that thou hast a soul self-governed, the noblest work of
   God, made after the image of its Creator [704] :  immortal because of
   God that gives it immortality; a living being, rational, imperishable,
   because of Him that bestowed these gifts:  having free power to do what
   it willeth [705] .  For it is not according to thy nativity that thou
   sinnest, nor is it by the power of chance that thou committest
   fornication, nor, as some idly talk, do the conjunctions of the stars
   compel thee to give thyself to wantonness [706] .  Why dost thou shrink
   from confessing thine own evil deeds, and ascribe the blame to the
   innocent stars?  Give no more heed, pray, to astrologers; for of these
   the divine Scripture saith, Let the stargazers of the heaven stand up
   and save thee, and what follows:  Behold, they all shall be consumed as
   stubble on the fire, and shall not deliver their soul from the flame
   [707] .

   19.  And learn this also, that the soul, before it came into this
   world, had committed no sin [708] , but having come in sinless, we now
   sin of our free-will.  Listen not, I pray thee, to any one perversely
   interpreting the words, But if I do that which I would not [709] :  but
   remember Him who saith, If ye be willing, and hearken unto Me, ye shall
   eat the good things of the land:  but if ye be not willing, neither
   hearken unto Me, the sword shall devour you, &c. [710] :  and again, As
   ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity
   unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to
   righteousness unto sanctification [711] .  Remember also the Scripture,
   which saith, Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge
   [712] :  and, That which may be known of God is manifestin them [713] ;
   and again, their eyes they have closed [714] .  Also remember how God
   again accuseth them, and saith, Yet I planted thee a fruitful vine,
   wholly true:  how art thou turned to bitterness, thou the strange vine
   [715] ?

   20.  The soul is immortal, and all souls are alike both of men and
   women; for only the members of the body are distinguished [716] .
   There is not a class of souls sinning by nature, and a class of souls
   practising righteousness by nature [717] :  but both act from choice,
   the substance of their souls being of one kind only, and alike in all.
   I know, however, that I am talking much, and that the time is already
   long:  but what is more precious than salvation?  Art thou not willing
   to take trouble in getting provisions for the way against the
   heretics?  And wilt thou not learn the bye-paths of the road, lest from
   ignorance thou fall down a precipice?  If thy teachers think it no
   small gain for thee to learn these things, shouldest not thou the
   learner gladly receive the multitude of things told thee?

   21.  The soul is self-governed:  and though the devil can suggest, he
   has not the power to compel against the will.  He pictures to thee the
   thought of fornication:  if thou wilt, thou acceptest it; if thou wilt
   not, thou rejectest.  For if thou wert a fornicator by necessity, then
   for what cause did God prepare hell?  If thou were a doer of
   righteousness by nature and not by will, wherefore did God prepare
   crowns of ineffable glory?  The sheep is gentle, but never was it
   crowned for its gentleness:  since its gentle quality belongs to it not
   from choice but by nature.

   Of the Body.

   22.  Thou hast learned, beloved, the nature of the soul, as far as
   there is time at present:  now do thy best to receive the doctrine of
   the body also.  Suffer none of those who say that this body is no work
   of God [718] :  for they who believe that the body is independent of
   God, and that the soul dwells in it as in a strange vessel, readily
   abuse it to fornication [719] .  And yet what fault have they found in
   this wonderful body?  For what is lacking in comeliness?  And what in
   its structure is not full of skill?  Ought they not to have observed
   the luminous construction of the eyes?  And how the ears being set
   obliquely receive the sound unhindered?  And how the smell is able to
   distinguish scents, and to perceive exhalations?  And how the tongue
   ministers to two purposes, the sense of taste, and the power of
   speech?  How the lungs placed out of sight are unceasing in their
   respiration of the air?  Who imparted the incessant pulsation of the
   heart?  Who made the distribution into so many veins and arteries?  Who
   skilfully knitted together the bones with the sinews?  Who assigned a
   part of the food to our substance, and separated a part for decent
   secretion, and hid away the unseemly members in more seemly places?
   Who when the human race must have died out, rendered it by a simple
   intercourse perpetual?

   23.  Tell me not that the body is a cause of sin [720] .  For if the
   body is a cause of sin, why does not a dead body sin?  Put a sword in
   the right hand of one just dead, and no murder takes place.  Let
   beauties of every kind pass before a youth just dead, and no impure
   desire arises.  Why?  Because the body sins not of itself, but the soul
   through the body.  The body is an instrument, and, as it were, a
   garment and robe of the soul:  and if by this latter it be given over
   to fornication, it becomes defiled:  but if it dwell with a holy soul,
   it becomes a temple of the Holy Ghost.  It is not I that say this, but
   the Apostle Paul hath said, Know ye not, that your bodies are the
   temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you [721] ?  Be tender, therefore,
   of thy body as being a temple of the Holy Ghost.  Pollute not thy flesh
   in fornication:  defile not this thy fairest robe:  and if ever thou
   hast defiled it, now cleanse it by repentance:  get thyself washed,
   while time permits.

   24.  And to the doctrine of chastity let the first to give heed be the
   order of Solitaries [722] and of Virgins, who maintain the angelic life
   in the world; and let the rest of the Church's people follow them.  For
   you, brethren, a great crown is laid up:  barter not away a great
   dignity for a petty pleasure:  listen to the Apostle speaking:  Lest
   there be any fornicator or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of
   meat sold his own birthright [723] .  Enrolled henceforth in the
   Angelic books for thy profession of chastity, see that thou be not
   blotted out again for thy practice of fornication.

   25.  Nor again, on the other hand, in maintaining thy chastity be thou
   puffed up against those who walk in the humbler path of matrimony.  For
   as the Apostle saith, Let marriage be had in honour among all, and let
   the bed be undefiled [724] .  Thou too who retainest thy chastity, wast
   thou not begotten of those who had married?  Because thou hast a
   possession of gold, do not on that account reprobate the silver.  But
   let those also be of good cheer, who being married use marriage
   lawfully; who make a marriage according to God's ordinance, and not of
   wantonness for the sake of unbounded license; who recognise seasons of
   abstinence, that they may give themselves unto prayer [725] ; who in
   our assemblies bring clean bodies as well as clean garments into the
   Church; who have entered upon matrimony for the procreation of
   children, but not for indulgence.

   26.  Let those also who marry but once not reprobate those who have
   consented to a second marriage [726] :  for though continence is a
   noble and admirable thing, yet it is also permissible to enter upon a
   second marriage, that the weak may not fall into fornication.  For it
   is good for them, saith the Apostle, if they abide even as I.  But if
   they have not continency, let them marry:  for it is better to marry
   than to burn [727] .  But let all the other practices be banished afar,
   fornication, adultery, and every kind of licentiousness:  and let the
   body be kept pure for the Lord, that the Lord also may have respect
   unto the body.  And let the body be nourished with food, that it may
   live, and serve without hindrance; not, however, that it may be given
   up to luxuries.

   Concerning Meats.

   27.  And concerning food let these be your ordinances, since in regard
   to meats also many stumble.  For some deal indifferently with things
   offered to idols [728] , while others discipline themselves, but
   condemn those that eat:  and in different ways men's souls are defiled
   in the matter of meats, from ignorance of the useful reasons for eating
   and not eating.  For we fast by abstaining from wine and flesh, not
   because we abhor them as abominations, but because we look for our
   reward; that having scorned things sensible, we may enjoy a spiritual
   and intellectual feast; and that having now sown in tears we may reap
   in joy [729] in the world to come.  Despise not therefore them that
   eat, and because of the weakness of their bodies partake of food:  nor
   yet blame these who use a little wine for their stomach's sake and
   their often infirmities [730] :  and neither condemn the men as
   sinners, nor abhor the flesh as strange food; for the Apostle knows
   some of this sort, when he says:  forbidding to marry, and commanding
   to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with
   thanksgiving by them that believe [731] .  In abstaining then from
   these things, abstain not as from things abominable [732] , else thou
   hast no reward:  but as being good things disregard them for the sake
   of the better spiritual things set before thee.

   28.  Guard thy soul safely, lest at any time thou eat of things offered
   to idols:  for concerning meats of this kind, not only I at this time,
   but ere now Apostles also, and James the bishop of this Church, have
   had earnest care:  and the Apostles and Elders write a Catholic epistle
   to all the Gentiles, that they should abstain first from things offered
   to idols, and then from blood also and from things strangled [733] .
   For many men being of savage nature, and living like dogs, both lap up
   blood [734] , in imitation of the manner of the fiercest beasts, and
   greedily devour things strangled.  But do thou, the servant of Christ,
   in eating observe to eat with reverence.  And so enough concerning
   meats.

   Of Apparel.

   29.  But let thine apparel be plain, not for adornment, but for
   necessary covering:  not to minister to thy vanity, but to keep thee
   warm in winter, and to hide the unseemliness of the body:  lest under
   pretence of hiding the unseemliness, thou fall into another kind of
   unseemliness by thy extravagant dress.

   Of the Resurrection.

   30.  Be tender, I beseech thee, of this body, and understand that thou
   wilt be raised from the dead, to be judged with this body.  But if
   there steal into thy mind any thought of unbelief, as though the thing
   were impossible, judge of the things unseen by what happens to
   thyself.  For tell me; a hundred years ago or more, think where wast
   thou thyself:  and from what a most minute and mean substance thou art
   come to so great a stature, and so much dignity of beauty [735] .  What
   then?  Cannot He who brought the non-existent into being, raise up
   again that which already exists and has decayed [736] ?  He who raises
   the corn, which is sown for our sakes, as year by year it dies,--will
   He have difficulty in raising us up, for whose sakes that corn also has
   been raised [737] ?  Seest thou how the trees stand now for many months
   without either fruit or leaves:  but when the winter is past they
   spring up whole into life again as if from the dead [738] :  shall not
   we much rather and more easily return to life?  The rod of Moses was
   transformed by the will of God into the unfamiliar nature of a
   serpent:  and cannot a man, who has fallen into death, be restored to
   himself again?

   31.  Heed not those who say that this body is not raised; for it is
   raised:  and Esaias is witness, when he says:  The dead shall arise,
   and they that are in the tombs shall awake [739] :  and according to
   Daniel, Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise,
   some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame [740] .  But
   though to rise again is common to all men, yet the resurrection is not
   alike to all:  for the bodies received by us all are eternal, but not
   like bodies by all:  for the just receive them, that through eternity
   they may join the Choirs of Angels; but the sinners, that they may
   endure for ever the torment of their sins.

   Of the Laver.

   32.  For this cause the Lord, preventing us according to His
   loving-kindness, has granted repentance at Baptism [741] , in order
   that we may cast off the chief--nay rather the whole burden of our
   sins, and having received the seal by the Holy Ghost, may be made heirs
   of eternal life.  But as we have spoken sufficiently concerning the
   Laver the day before yesterday, let us now return to the remaining
   subjects of our introductory teaching.

   Of the Divine Scriptures.

   33.  Now these the divinely-inspired Scriptures of both the Old and the
   New Testament teach us.  For the God of the two Testaments is One, Who
   in the Old Testament foretold the Christ Who appeared in the New; Who
   by the Law and the Prophets led us to Christ's school.  For before
   faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, and, the law hath been
   our tutor to bring us unto Christ [742] .  And if ever thou hear any of
   the heretics speaking evil of the Law or the Prophets, answer in the
   sound of the Saviour's voice, saying, Jesus came not to destroy the
   Law, but to fulfil it [743] .  Learn also diligently, and from the
   Church, what are the books of the Old Testament, and what those of the
   New.  And, pray, read none of the apocryphal writings [744] :  for why
   dost thou, who knowest not those which are acknowledged among all,
   trouble thyself in vain about those which are disputed?  Read the
   Divine Scriptures, the twenty-two books of the Old Testament, these
   that have been translated by the Seventy-two Interpreters [745] .

   34.  For after the death of Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, and
   the division of his kingdom into four principalities, into Babylonia,
   and Macedonia, and Asia, and Egypt, one of those who reigned over
   Egypt, Ptolemy Philadelphus, being a king very fond of learning, while
   collecting the books that were in every place, heard from Demetrius
   Phalereus, the curator of his library, of the Divine Scriptures of the
   Law and the Prophets, and judged it much nobler, not to get the books
   from the possessors by force against their will, but rather to
   propitiate them by gifts and friendship; and knowing that what is
   extorted is often adulterated, being given unwillingly, while that
   which is willingly supplied is freely given with all sincerity, he sent
   to Eleazar, who was then High Priest, a great many gifts for the Temple
   here at Jerusalem, and caused him to send him six interpreters from
   each of the twelve tribes of Israel for the translation [746] .  Then,
   further, to make experiment whether the books were Divine or not, he
   took precaution that those who had been sent should not combine among
   themselves, by assigning to each of the interpreters who had come his
   separate chamber in the island called Pharos, which lies over against
   Alexandria, and committed to each the whole Scriptures to translate.
   And when they had fulfilled the task in seventy-two days, he brought
   together all their translations, which they had made in different
   chambers without sending them one to another, and found that they
   agreed not only in the sense but even in words.  For the process was no
   word-craft, nor contrivance of human devices:  but the translation of
   the Divine Scriptures, spoken by the Holy Ghost, was of the Holy Ghost
   accomplished.

   35.  Of these read the two and twenty books, but have nothing to do
   with the apocryphal writings.  Study earnestly these only which we read
   openly in the Church.  Far wiser and more pious than thyself were the
   Apostles, and the bishops of old time, the presidents of the Church who
   handed down these books.  Being therefore a child of the Church, trench
   [747] thou not upon its statutes.  And of the Old Testament, as we have
   said, study the two and twenty books, which, if thou art desirous of
   learning, strive to remember by name, as I recite them.  For of the Law
   the books of Moses are the first five, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
   Numbers, Deuteronomy.  And next, Joshua the son of Nave [748] , and the
   book of Judges, including Ruth, counted as seventh.  And of the other
   historical books, the first and second books of the Kings [749] are
   among the Hebrews one book; also the third and fourth one book.  And in
   like manner, the first and second of Chronicles are with them one book;
   and the first and second of Esdras are counted one.  Esther is the
   twelfth book; and these are the Historical writings.  But those which
   are written in verses are five, Job, and the book of Psalms, and
   Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs, which is the
   seventeenth book.  And after these come the five Prophetic books:  of
   the Twelve Prophets one book, of Isaiah one, of Jeremiah one, including
   Baruch and Lamentations and the Epistle [750] ; then Ezekiel, and the
   Book of Daniel, the twenty-second of the Old Testament.

   36.  Then of the New Testament there are the four Gospels only, for the
   rest have false titles [751] and are mischievous.  The Manichæans also
   wrote a Gospel according to Thomas, which being tinctured with the
   fragrance of the evangelic title corrupts the souls of the simple
   sort.  Receive also the Acts of the Twelve Apostles; and in addition to
   these the seven Catholic Epistles of James, Peter, John, and Jude; and
   as a seal upon them all, and the last work of the disciples, the
   fourteen Epistles of Paul [752] .  But let all the rest be put aside in
   a secondary rank.  And whatever books are not read in Churches, these
   read not even by thyself, as thou hast heard me say.  Thus much of
   these subjects.

   37.  But shun thou every diabolical operation, and believe not the
   apostate Serpent, whose transformation from a good nature was of his
   own free choice:  who can over-persuade the willing, but can compel no
   one.  Also give heed neither to observations of the stars nor auguries,
   nor omens, nor to the fabulous divinations of the Greeks [753] .
   Witchcraft, and enchantment, and the wicked practices of necromancy,
   admit not even to a hearing.  From every kind of intemperance stand
   aloof, giving thyself neither to gluttony nor licentiousness, rising
   superior to all covetousness and usury.  Neither venture thyself at
   heathen assemblies for public spectacles, nor ever use amulets in
   sicknesses; shun also all the vulgarity of tavern-haunting.  Fall not
   away either into the sect of the Samaritans, or into Judaism:  for
   Jesus Christ henceforth hath ransomed thee.  Stand aloof from all
   observance of Sabbaths [754] , and from calling any indifferent meats
   common or unclean.  But especially abhor all the assemblies of wicked
   heretics; and in every way make thine own soul safe, by fastings,
   prayers, almsgivings, and reading the oracles of God; that having lived
   the rest of thy life in the flesh in soberness and godly doctrine, thou
   mayest enjoy the one salvation which flows from Baptism; and thus
   enrolled in the armies of heaven by God and the Father, mayest also be
   deemed worthy of the heavenly crowns, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to Whom
   be the glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

   [638] The number "ten" is confirmed by Theodoret, who quotes the
   article on Christ's "Birth of the Virgin" as from Cyril's fourth
   Catechetical Lecture "On the ten Doctrines."  The mss. vary between
   "ten" and "eleven," and differ also in the special titles and
   numeration of the separate Articles.

   [640] Job xli. 24, Sept.; xli. 15:  he kardia autou...hesteken hosper

   directed against Origen's opinion (De Principiis I. 2), that the Angels
   "who have been removed from their primal state of blessedness have not
   been removed irrecoverably."  The question is discussed, and the
   opinions of several Fathers quoted, by Huet, Origeniana, II. c. 25.

   [649] Compare Rom. vi. 17:  "that form of teaching whereunto ye were

   Faith was commonly called the "Traditio Symboli," or "Delivery of the
   Creed."

   [651] Compare Hermas, Mandat. I.  Athan. Epist. de Decretis Nic. Syn.
   xxii.:  houto kai to atrepton kai analloioton auton einai sothesetai.
   So Aristotle (Metaphys. XI. c. iv. 13) describes the First Cause as
   apathes kai analloioton.

   [652] Irenæus, I. c. xxvii. says that Cerdo taught that the God of the
   Law and the Prophets was not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:  for
   that He is known, but the other unknown, and the one is just, but the
   other good.  Also III. c. 25, § 3:  "Marcion himself, therefore, by
   dividing God into two, and calling the one good, and the other
   judicial, on both sides puts an end to Deity."  Compare Tertullian, c.
   Marcion. I. 2, and 6; Origen, c. Cels. iv. 54.

   [653] This tenet was held by the Manichæans and other heretics, and is
   traced back to the Apostolic age by Bishop Pearson (Exposition of the
   Creed, Art. i. p. 79, note c).  Compare Athanasius c. Apollinarium, I.
   21; II. 8; c. Gentes, § 6; de Incarnatione, § 2, in this series, and
   Augustine (c. Faustum, xx. 15, 21, and xxi. 4).

   Cels. vii. 34:  "God is of too excellent a nature for any place:  He
   holds all things in His power, and is Himself not confined by anything
   whatever."  Compare the quotation from Sir Isaac Newton's Principia, in
   the note on Cat. vi. 8.

   [658] Is. xl. 12.

   [659] See Cat. xv. 3, and note there.

   [660] idean.  Cyril uses the word in the Platonic sense, as in the next
   sentence he adopts the formula, which Plato commonly uses in describing
   the "idea:"  aei kata ta auta kai hosautos echein.  Phaed. 78 c.

   [661] Job xxxi. 26, 27.  The worship of Sun and Moon under various
   names was almost universal.

   [662] Gaea or Tellus, the earth; Zeus or Jupiter, the sky; rivers,
   fountains, &c.

   [663] Music, Medicine, Hunting, War, Agriculture, Metallurgy, &c.,
   represented by Apollo, Æsculapius, Diana, Mars, Ceres, Vulcan.

   [664] Herodotus, Book II., describes the Egyptian worship of various
   birds, fishes, and quadrupeds.  Leeks and onions also were held
   sacred:  Porrum et caepe nefas violare, Juv. Sat. xv. 9.  Compare
   Clement of Alexandria, Protrept. c. ii. § 39, Klotz.

   [665] Eros, Dionysus.

   [666] Clement of Alexandria (Protrept. c. iv. § 53, Klotz) states that
   the courtesan Phryne was taken as a model for Aphrodite.  "Praxiteles
   when fashioning the statue of Aphrodite of Cnidus made it like the form
   of Cratine his paramour."  Ibid.

   [667] Plutus.

   [668] tes monarchias tou theou.  See note on the title of Cat. VI.
   Praxeas made use of the term "Monarchy" to exclude the Son (and the
   Spirit) from the Godhead.  Tertullian in his treatise against Praxeas
   maintains the true doctrine that the Son is no obstacle to the
   "Monarchy," because He is of the substance of the Father, does nothing
   without the Father's will, and has received all power from the Father,
   to Whom He will in the end deliver up the kingdom.  In this sense
   Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, speaks of the Divine Monarchy as "that most
   sacred doctrine of the Church of God."  Compare Athanas. de Decretis,
   Nic. Syn. c. vi. § 3 and Dr. Newman's note.  In Orat. iv. c. Arian. p
   606 (617), Athanasius derives the term from arche, in the sense of
   "beginning:"  houtos mia arche theotetos kai ou duo archai, hothen
   kurios kai monarchia estin.  See the full discussion of Monarchianism
   in Athanasius, p. xxiii. ff. in this series, and Newman's Introduction
   to Athan. Or. iv.

   [669] For phoran (Bened.) many mss. read phthoran, "corruption."

   [671] Ton homoion kata panta to gennesanti.  On the meaning and history
   of this phrase, proposed by the Semi-Arians at the Council of Ariminum
   as a substitute for homoousion, see Athan. de Syn. § 8, sqq.

   [672] enupostatos.  Cf. xi. 10; Athan. c. Apollinar. I. 20, 21.

   [673] The mss. vary much, but I have followed the Benedictine text.

   [674] Matt. xi. 27; John x. 15; xvii. 25.

   [675] This was a point earnestly maintained by the orthodox Bishops at
   Nicæa, that the Son begotten of the substance of the Father is ever
   inseparably in the Father.  Athan. de Decretis Syn. c. 20 ; Tertullian
   c. Marc. IV. c. 6.  Cf. Ignat. ad Trall. vi. (Long Recension):  ton men
   gar Christon allotriousi tou Patros.

   [676] huiopatoria.  A term of derision applied to the doctrine of
   Sabellius.  Compare Athanas. Expositio Fidei, c. 2:  "neither do we
   imagine a Son-Father, as the Sabellians."  See Index, Uiopator.

   [677] Logos prophorikos, the term used by Paul of Samosata, implied
   that the Word was impersonal, being conceived as a particular activity
   of God.  See Dorner, Person of Christ, Div. I. vol. ii. p. 436 (English
   Tr.):  and compare Athanasius, Expositio Fidei, c. 1; huion ek tou
   Patros anarchos kai aidios gegennemenon, logon de ou prophorikon, ouk
   endiatheton.  Cardinal Newman (Athan. c. Arianos, I. 7, note) observes
   that some Christian writers of the 2nd Century "seem to speak of the
   Divine generation as taking place immediately before the creation of
   the world, that is, as if not eternal, though at the same time they
   teach that our Lord existed before that generation.  In other words
   they seem to teach that He was the Word from eternity, and became the
   Son at the beginning of all things; some of them expressly considering
   Him, first as the logos endiathetos, or Reason, in the Father, or (as
   may be speciously represented) a mere attribute; next, as the logos
   prophorikos, or Word." The terms logos endiathetos, or word conceived
   in the mind,' and logos prophorikos, or word expressed' (emissum, or
   prolalivum), were in use among the Gnostics (Iren. II. c. 12, § 5).  As
   applied to the Son both terms, though sometimes used in a right sense,
   were condemned as inadequate.  Compare xi. 10.

   [678] anupostatois logois.  Athan. c. Arianos Orat. iv. c. 8:  palin
   hoi legontes monon onoma einai huiou, anousion de kai anupostaton einai

   [679] homoiopathe.  Compare Acts xiv. 15; Jas. v. 17.

   [680] On the origin of the Docetic heresy, see vi. 14.

   [681] Valentinus the Gnostic taught that God produced a Son of an
   animal nature who "passed through Mary just as water through a tube,
   and that on him the Saviour descended at his Baptism."  Irenæus, I.
   vii. 2.

   [682] The words which the Benedictine Editor introduces in the brackets
   are found in Theodoret, and adopted by recent Editors, with Codd. M.A.

   [683] Eusebius, Life of Constantine, iii. 28.

   [684] The discovery of the "True Cross" is related with many marvellous
   particulars by Socrates, Eccles. Hist. i. 17; and Sozomen, E. H. ii.
   1.  A portion was said to have been left by Helena at Jerusalem,
   enclosed in a silver case; and another portion sent to Constantinople,
   where Constantine privately enclosed it in his own statue, to be a
   safeguard to the city.  Eusebius, Life of Constantine, iii. 25-30 ,
   gives a long account of the discovery of the Holy Sepulchre, but makes
   no mention of the Cross.  Cyril seems to have been the first to record
   it, 25 years after.  Cf. Greg. Nyss. Bapt. Christi (p. 519).

   [685] Compare xiv. 18, 19, on the Descent into Hades.

   [686] The same Old Testament saints are named in xiv. 19, as redeemed
   by Christ in Hades.

   Redeemer, the power of whose Name even demons do fear; and at this day,
   when exorcised in the name of Jesus Christ, crucified under Pontius
   Pilate, Governor of Judæa, they are overcome.

   [690] Tertullian, de Coronâ, 3:  At every forward step and movement, at
   every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we
   bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on
   seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the
   forehead the Sign.  If for these, and other such rules, you insist upon
   having positive Scripture injunction, you will find none.  Tradition
   will be held forth to you as the originator of them, custom as their

   [701] The Benedictine Editor argues from Cat. i. 5, "that thou mayest
   by faith seal up the things that are spoken;" and xxiii. 18:  "sealing
   up the Prayer by the Amen," that Cyril means by "this seal" the firm
   belief of Christian doctrine.  Compare John iii. 33.  But Milles
   understands by the "seal" the Creed itself, which agrees better with
   the following context.

   [702] he soteria gar haute tes pisteos hemon, which might be rendered,
   "this our salvation by faith," or, with Milles, "this safety of our
   Faith."  For the rendering in the text compare Heb. iii. 1:  archierea
   tes homologias hemon.  On heuresilogia, see Polybius xviii. 29, § 3:
   dia tes pros allelous heuresilogias.

   [704] In the Clementine Homily xvi. 16, the soul having come forth from
   God, clothed with His breath, is said to be of the same substance, and
   yet not God.  In Tertull. c. Marcion II. c. 9, the soul is the affatus
   (pnoe not pneuma) of God, i.e. the image of the Spirit, and inferior to
   it, though possessing the true lineaments of divinity, immortality,
   freedom, its own mastery over itself.

   [705] Tertull. c. Marc. II. 6:  It was proper that he who is the image
   and likeness of God should be formed with a free will, and a mastery of
   himself, so that this very thing, namely freedom of will and
   self-command, might be reckoned as the image and likeness of God in
   him.

   [706] Compare Aug. de Civ. Dei. v. 1, where he says that the
   astrologers (Mathematici) say, not merely such or such a position of
   Mars signifies that a man will be a murderer, but makes him a
   murderer.  See Dict. of Christian Antiq., "Astrology."

   [708] "The Orphic poets were under the impression that the soul is
   suffering the punishment of sin, and that the body is an enclosure or
   prison in which the soul is incarcerated and kept (sozetai) as the name
   soma implies, until the penalty is paid."  Plato, Cratyl. 400.  Clement
   of Alexandria (Strom. III. iii. 17), after referring to this passage of
   Plato, quotes Philolaus the Pythagorean, as saying:  "The ancient
   theologians and soothsayers also testify that the soul has been chained
   to the body for a kind of punishment, and is buried in it as in a
   tomb."

   kinds of men, spiritual, material, and animal....These three natures
   are no longer found in one person, but constitute various kinds of
   men....And again subdividing the animal souls themselves, they say that
   some are by nature good, and others by nature evil."  Origen on Romans,
   Lib. VIII. § 10:  "I know not how those who come from the School of
   Valentinus and Basilides...suppose that there are souls of one nature
   which are always safe and never perish, and others which always perish,
   and are never saved."

   is usually traced to the time of the Decian persecution, the middle of
   the third century.  Previously "there were no monks, but only ascetics
   in the Church; from that time to the reign of Constantine, Monachism
   was confined to the anchorets living in private cells in the
   wilderness:  but when Pachomius had erected monasteries in Egypt, other
   countries presently followed the example....Hilarion, who was scholar
   to Antonius, was the first monk that ever lived in Palestine or

   [726] The condemnation of a second marriage, which the Benedictine
   Editor and others import into this passage, is not to be found in it.
   tous deutero gamo sumperienechthentas neither means "qui ad secundas
   nuptias ultro se dejecere," nor even "who have involved themselves"
   (R.W.C.), but simply "who have consented to,"--or, "consented together
   in--a second marriage," without any intimation of censure.  See V. 9;
   VI. 13:  Ecclus. xxv. 1; gune kai haner heautois sumperipheromenoi; 2
   Macc. ix. 27; Euseb. H. E. ix. 9, 7:  anexikakos kai summetros

   with which Cyril here speaks of second marriages is in striking
   contrast with the passionate vehemence of Tertullian in the treatise de
   Monogamia, and elsewhere.  Aug. de Hæresibus, cc. 26, 38, reckons the
   condemnation of second marriage among the heretical doctrines of the
   Montanists and Cathari.  In the treatise de Bono Viduitatis, c. 6, he
   argues that a second marriage is not to be condemned, but is less
   honourable than widowhood, and severely rebukes the heretical teaching
   on this point of Tertullian, the Montanists, and the Novatians.  De
   Bono Conjugali, c. 21:  Sacramentum nuptiarum temporis nostri sic ad
   unum virum et unam uxorem redactum est, ut Ecclesiæ dispensatorem non

   [743] Matt. v. 17.

   [744] ton apokruphon.  The sense in which Cyril uses this term may be
   learned from Rufinus (Expositio Symboli, § 38), who distinguishes three
   classes of books:  (1) The Canonical Books of the Old and New
   Testaments, which alone are to be used in proof of doctrine; (2)
   Ecclesiastical, which may be read in Churches, including Wisdom,
   Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, and the Books of the Maccabees, in the
   Old Testament, and The Shepherd of Hermas, and The Two Ways in the New
   Testament; (3) The other writings they called "Apocryphal," which they
   would not have read in Churches.  The distinction is useful, though the
   second class is not complete.

   [745] The original source of this account of the Septuagint version is
   a letter purporting to have been written by Aristeas, or Aristæus, a
   confidential minister of Ptolemy Philadelphus, to his brother
   Philocrates.  Though the letter is not regarded as genuine its
   statements are in part admitted to be true, being confirmed by a
   fragment, preserved by Eusebius (Præparatio Evangelica, ix. 6.), of a
   work of Aristobulus, a Jewish philosopher who wrote in the reign of
   Ptolemy Philometor, 181-146, b.c.  Upon these testimonies it is
   generally admitted that "the whole Law," i.e. the Pentateuch was
   translated into Greek at Alexandria in the reign either of Ptolemy
   Soter (323-285, b.c.), or of his son Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-247,
   b.c.), under the direction of Demetrius Phalereus, curator of the
   King's library.

   [746] Up to this point Cyril's account is based upon the statements of
   the Pseudo-Aristeas.  The fabulous incidents which follow, concerning
   the separate cells, the completion of the whole version by each
   translator, the miraculous agreement in the very words, proving a
   Divine inspiration, are found in Philo Judæus, Life of Moses, II. 7.
   Josephus, Antiquities, XII. c. ii. 3-14, following the letter of
   Aristeas, gives long descriptions of the magnificent presents sent by
   Philadelphus to Jerusalem, and of his splendid hospitality to the
   translators, but makes no allusion to the separate cells or miraculous
   agreement.  On the contrary he represents the 72 interpreters as
   meeting together for consultation, agreeing on the text to be adopted,
   and completing their joint labours in 72 days.  The slightest
   comparison of the Version with the original Hebrew must convince any
   reasonable person that the idea of divine inspiration or supernatural
   assistance, borrowed by Justin Martyr, Irenæus, and other Fathers,
   apparently from Philo, is a mere invention of the imagination,
   disproved by the facts.  Compare the article "Septuagint" in Murray's
   Dictionary of the Bible.

   [747] The rendering "trench not" (R.W.C.) agrees well with the
   etymology of the verb (paracharasso).  Its more usual signification
   seems to be "counterfeit," "forge."  The sense required here, apart
   from any metaphor, is "transgress" (Heurtley).

   [748] The name "Nun" is represented by "Nave" in the Septuagint, which
   Cyril used.

   [749] The two books of Samuel.

   [750] The Epistle of Jeremy, which now appears in the Apocrypha as the
   last chapter of Baruch.  On the number and arrangement of the Books of
   the Old and New Testaments the student should consult an interesting
   Essay by Professor Sanday (Studia Biblica, vol. iii.), who traces the
   introduction of a fixed order to the time when papyrus rolls were
   superseded by codices, in which the sheets of skin were folded and
   bound together, as in printed books.  This change had commenced before
   the Diocletian persecution, a.d. 303, when among the sacred books taken
   from the Christians codices were much more numerous than rolls.  On the
   contents of the Jewish Canon, see Dictionary of the Bible, "Canon."
   B.F.W. "Josephus enumerates 20 books which are justly believed to be
   divine.'"  One of the earliest attempts by a Christian to ascertain
   correctly the number and order of the Books of the O.T. was made by
   Melito, Bishop of Sardis, who travelled for this purpose to Palestine,
   in the latter part of the 2nd Century.  His list is as follows:--"Of
   Moses five (books); Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, Deuteronomy,
   Jesus son of Nave, Judges, Ruth, four Books of Kings, two of
   Chronicles, Psalms of David, Solomon's Proverbs, which is also called
   Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job, Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
   the Twelve in one Book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras."  (Eusebius, H.E. III.
   cap. 10, note I, in this series.)  Cyril's List agrees with that of
   Athanasius (Festal Epistle, 373 a.d.), except that Job is placed by
   Ath. after Canticles instead of before Psalms.

   [751] Gr. pseudepigrapha.  For an account of the many Apocryphal
   Gospels, see the article by Lipsius in the "Dictionary of Christian
   Biography," Smith and Wace, and the English translations in Clark's
   Ante-Nicene Library.

   [752] Cyril includes in this list all the books which we receive,
   except the Apocalypse.  See Bishop Westcott's Article "Canon," in the
   Dictionary of the Bible, and Origen's Catalogue in Euseb. Hist. vi. 25
   (Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, vol. i.).

   service of the devil.

   Lecture V.

   Of Faith.

   Hebrews xi. 1, 2

   Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
   not seen.  For by it the elders obtained a good report.

   1.  How great a dignity the Lord bestows on you in transferring you
   from the order of Catechumens to that of the Faithful, the Apostle Paul
   shews, when he affirms, God is faithful, by Whom ye were called into
   the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ [755] .  For since God is called
   Faithful, thou also in receiving this title receivest a great dignity.
   For as God is called Good, and Just, and Almighty, and Maker of the
   Universe, so is He also called Faithful.  Consider therefore to what a
   dignity thou art rising, seeing thou art to become partaker of a title
   of God [756] .

   2.  Here then it is further required, that each of you be found
   faithful in his conscience:  for a faithful man it is hard to find
   [757] :  not that thou shouldest shew thy conscience to me, for thou
   art not to be judged of man's judgment [758] ; but that thou shew the
   sincerity of thy faith to God, who trieth the reins and hearts [759] ,
   and knoweth the thoughts of men [760] .  A great thing is a faithful
   man, being richest of all rich men.  For to the faithful man belongs
   the whole world of wealth [761] , in that he disdains and tramples on
   it.  For they who in appearance are rich, and have many possessions,
   are poor in soul:  since the more they gather, the more they pine with
   longing for what is still lacking.  But the faithful man, most strange
   paradox, in poverty is rich:  for knowing that we need only to have
   food and raiment, and being therewith content [762] , he has trodden
   riches under foot.

   3.  Nor is it only among us, who bear the name of Christ, that the
   dignity of faith is great [763] :  but likewise all things that are
   accomplished in the world, even by those who are aliens [764] from the
   Church, are accomplished by faith.

   By faith the laws of marriage yoke together those who have lived as
   strangers:  and because of the faith in marriage contracts a stranger
   is made partner of a stranger's person and possessions.  By faith
   husbandry also is sustained, for he who believes not that he shall
   receive a harvest endures not the toils.  By faith sea-faring men,
   trusting to the thinnest plank, exchange that most solid element, the
   land, for the restless motion of the waves, committing themselves to
   uncertain hopes, and carrying with them a faith more sure than any
   anchor.  By faith therefore most of men's affairs are held together:
   and not among us only has there been this belief, but also, as I have
   said, among those who are without [765] .  For if they receive not the
   Scriptures, but bring forward certain doctrines of their own, even
   these they accept by faith.

   4.  The lesson also which was read to-day invites you to the true
   faith, by setting before you the way in which you also must please
   God:  for it affirms that without faith it is impossible to please Him
   [766] .  For when will a man resolve to serve God, unless he believes
   that He is a giver of reward?  When will a young woman choose a virgin
   life, or a young man live soberly, if they believe not that for
   chastity there is a crown that fadeth not away [767] ?  Faith is an eye
   that enlightens every conscience, and imparts understanding; for the
   Prophet saith, And if ye believe not, ye shall not understand [768] .

   Faith stoppeth the mouths of lions [769] , as in Daniel's case:  for
   the Scripture saith concerning him, that Daniel was brought up out of
   the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed
   in his God [770] .  Is there anything more fearful than the devil?  Yet
   even against him we have no other shield than faith [771] , an
   impalpable buckler against an unseen foe.  For he sends forth divers
   arrows, and shoots down in the dark night [772] those that watch not;
   but, since the enemy is unseen, we have faith as our strong armour,
   according to the saying of the Apostle, In all things taking the shield
   of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of
   the wicked one [773] .  A fiery dart of desire of base indulgence is
   often cast forth from the devil:  but faith, suggesting a picture of
   the judgment, cools down the mind, and quenches the dart.

   5.  There is much to tell of faith, and the whole day would not be time
   sufficient for us to describe it fully.  At present let us be content
   with Abraham only, as one of the examples from the Old Testament,
   seeing that we have been made his sons through faith.  He was justified
   not only by works, but also by faith [774] :  for though he did many
   things well, yet he was never called the friend of God [775] , except
   when he believed.  Moreover, his every work was performed in faith.
   Through faith he left his parents; left country, and place, and home
   through faith [776] .  In like manner, therefore, as he was justified
   be thou justified also.  In his body he was already dead in regard to
   offspring, and Sarah his wife was now old, and there was no hope left
   of having children.  God promises the old man a child, and Abraham
   without being weakened in faith, though he considered his own body now
   as good as dead [777] , heeded not the weakness of his body, but the
   power of Him who promised, because he counted Him faithful who had
   promised [778] , and so beyond all expectation gained the child from
   bodies as it were already dead.  And when, after he had gained his son,
   he was commanded to offer him up, although he had heard the word, In
   Isaac shall thy seed be called [779] , he proceeded to offer up his
   son, his only son, to God, believing that God is able to raise up even
   from the dead [780] .  And having bound his son, and laid him on the
   wood, he did in purpose offer him, but by the goodness of God in
   delivering to him a lamb instead of his child, he received his son
   alive.  Being faithful in these things, he was sealed for
   righteousness, and received circumcision as a seal of the faith which
   he had while he was in uncircumcision [781] , having received a promise
   that he should be the father of many nations [782] .

   6.  Let us see, then, how Abraham is the father of many nations [783]
   .  Of Jews he is confessedly the father, through succession according
   to the flesh.  But if we hold to the succession according to the flesh,
   we shall be compelled to say that the oracle was false.  For according
   to the flesh he is no longer father of us all:  but the example of his
   faith makes us all sons of Abraham.  How? and in what manner?  With men
   it is incredible that one should rise from the dead; as in like manner
   it is incredible also that there should be offspring from aged persons
   as good as dead.  But when Christ is preached as having been crucified
   on the tree, and as having died and risen again, we believe it.  By the
   likeness therefore of our faith we are adopted into the sonship of
   Abraham.  And then, following upon our faith, we receive like him the
   spiritual seal, being circumcised by the Holy Spirit through Baptism,
   not in the foreskin of the body, but in the heart, according to
   Jeremiah, saying, And ye shall be circumcised unto God in the foreskin
   of your heart [784] :  and according to the Apostle, in the
   circumcision of Christ, having been buried with Him in baptism, and the
   rest [785] .

   7.  This faith if we keep we shall be free from condemnation, and shall
   be adorned with all kinds of virtues.  For so great is the strength of
   faith, as even to buoy men up in walking on the sea.  Peter was a man
   like ourselves, made up of flesh and blood, and living upon like food.
   But when Jesus said, Come [786] , he believed, and walked upon the
   waters, and found his faith safer upon the waters than any ground; and
   his heavy body was upheld by the buoyancy of his faith.  But though he
   had safe footing over the water as long as he believed, yet when he
   doubted, at once he began to sink:  for as his faith gradually relaxed,
   his body also was drawn down with it.  And when He saw his distress,
   Jesus who remedies the distresses of our souls, said, O thou of little
   faith, wherefore didst thou doubt [787] ?  And being nerved again by
   Him who grasped his right hand, he had no sooner recovered his faith,
   than, led by the hand of the Master, he resumed the same walking upon
   the waters:  for this the Gospel indirectly mentioned, saying, when
   they were gone up into the ship [788] .  For it says not that Peter
   swam across and went up, but gives us to understand that, after
   returning the same distance that he went to meet Jesus, he went up
   again into the ship.

   8.  Yea, so much power hath faith, that not the believer only is saved,
   but some have been saved by others believing.  The paralytic in
   Capernaum was not a believer, but they believed who brought him, and
   let him down through the tiles [789] :  for the sick man's soul shared
   the sickness of his body.  And think not that I accuse him without
   cause:  the Gospel itself says, when Jesus saw, not his faith, but
   their faith, He saith to the sick of the palsy, Arise [790] !  The
   bearers believed, and the sick of the palsy enjoyed the blessing of the
   cure.

   9.  Wouldest thou see yet more surely that some are saved by others'
   faith?  Lazarus died [791] :  one day had passed, and a second, and a
   third:  his sinews [792] were decayed, and corruption was preying
   already upon his body.  How could one four days dead believe, and
   entreat the Redeemer on his own behalf?  But what the dead man lacked
   was supplied by his true sisters.  For when the Lord was come, the
   sister fell down before Him, and when He said, Where have ye laid him?
   and she had made answer, Lord, by this time he stinketh; for he hath
   been four days dead, the Lord said, If thou believe, thou shalt see the
   glory of God; as much as saying, Supply thou the dead man's lack of
   faith:  and the sisters' faith had so much power, that it recalled the
   dead from the gates of hell.  Have then men by believing, the one on
   behalf of the other, been able to raise [793] the dead, and shalt not
   thou, if thou believe sincerely on thine own behalf, be much rather
   profited?  Nay, even if thou be faithless, or of little faith, the Lord
   is loving unto man; He condescends to thee on thy repentance:  only on
   thy part say with honest mind, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief
   [794] .  But if thou thinkest that thou really art faithful, but hast
   not yet the fulness of faith, thou too hast need to say like the
   Apostles, Lord, increase our faith [795] :  for some part thou hast of
   thyself, but the greater part thou receivest from Him.

   10.  For the name of Faith is in the form of speech [796] one, but has
   two distinct senses.  For there is one kind of faith, the dogmatic,
   involving an assent of the soul on some particular point:  and it is
   profitable to the soul, as the Lord saith:  He that heareth My words,
   and believeth Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not
   into judgment [797] :  and again, He that believeth in the Son is not
   judged, but hath passed from death unto life [798] .  Oh the great
   loving-kindness of God!  For the righteous were many years in pleasing
   Him:  but what they succeeded in gaining by many years of well-pleasing
   [799] , this Jesus now bestows on thee in a single hour.  For if thou
   shalt believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that God raised Him from
   the dead, thou shalt be saved, and shalt be transported into Paradise
   by Him who brought in thither the robber.  And doubt not whether it is
   possible; for He who on this sacred Golgotha saved the robber after one
   single hour of belief, the same shall save thee also on thy believing
   [800] .

   11.  But there is a second kind of faith, which is bestowed by Christ
   as a gift of grace.  For to one is given through the Spirit the word of
   wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same
   Spirit:  to another faith, by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of
   healing [801] .  This faith then which is given of grace from the
   Spirit is not merely doctrinal, but also worketh things above man's
   power.  For whosoever hath this faith, shall say to this mountain,
   Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove [802] .  For whenever
   any one shall say this in faith, believing that it cometh to pass, and
   shall not doubt in his heart, then receiveth he the grace.

   And of this faith it is said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard
   seed [803] .  For just as the grain of mustard seed is small in size,
   but fiery in its operation, and though sown in a small space has a
   circle of great branches, and when grown up is able even to shelter the
   fowls [804] ; so, likewise, faith in the swiftest moment works the
   greatest effects in the soul.  For, when enlightened by faith, the soul
   hath visions of God, and as far as is possible beholds God, and ranges
   round the bounds of the universe, and before the end of this world
   already beholds the Judgment, and the payment of the promised rewards.
   Have thou therefore that faith in Him which cometh from thine own self,
   that thou mayest also receive from Him that faith which worketh things
   above man [805] .

   12.  But in learning the Faith and in professing it, acquire and keep
   that only, which is now delivered [806] to thee by the Church, and
   which has been built up strongly out of all the Scriptures.  For since
   all cannot read the Scriptures, some being hindered as to the knowledge
   of them by want of learning, and others by a want of leisure, in order
   that the soul may not perish from ignorance, we comprise the whole
   doctrine of the Faith in a few lines.  This summary I wish you both to
   commit to memory when I recite it [807] , and to rehearse it with all
   diligence among yourselves, not writing it out on paper [808] , but
   engraving it by the memory upon your heart [809] , taking care while
   you rehearse it that no Catechumen chance to overhear the things which
   have been delivered to you.  I wish you also to keep this as a
   provision [810] through the whole course of your life, and beside this
   to receive no other, neither if we ourselves should change and
   contradict our present teaching, nor if an adverse angel, transformed
   into an angel of light [811] should wish to lead you astray.  For
   though we or an angel from heaven preach to you any other gospel than
   that ye have received, let him be to you anathema [812] .  So for the
   present listen while I simply say the Creed [813] , and commit it to
   memory; but at the proper season expect the confirmation out of Holy
   Scripture of each part of the contents.  For the articles of the Faith
   were not composed as seemed good to men; but the most important points
   collected out of all the Scripture make up one complete teaching of the
   Faith.  And just as the mustard seed in one small grain contains many
   branches, so also this Faith has embraced in few words all the
   knowledge of godliness in the Old and New Testaments.  Take heed then,
   brethren, and hold fast the traditions [814] which ye now receive, and
   write them an the table of your heart [815] .

   13.  Guard them with reverence, lest per chance the enemy despoil any
   who have grown slack; or lest some heretic pervert any of the truths
   delivered to you.  For faith is like putting money into the bank [816]
   , even as we have now done; but from you God requires the accounts of
   the deposit.  I charge you, as the Apostle saith, before God, who
   quickeneth all things, and Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate
   witnessed the good confession, that ye keep this faith which is
   committed to you, without spot, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus
   Christ [817] .  A treasure of life has now been committed to thee, and
   the Master demandeth the deposit at His appearing, which in His own
   times He shall shew, Who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of
   kings, and Lord of lords; Who only hath immortality, dwelling in light
   which no man can approach unto; Whom no man hath seen nor can see.  To
   Whom be glory, honour, and power [818] for ever and ever.  Amen.

   [763] It was a common objection of Pagan philosophers that the
   Christian religion was not founded upon reason but only on faith.
   Cyril's answer that faith is necessary in the ordinary affairs of life
   is the same which Origen had employed against Celsus (I. 11):  "Why
   should it not be more reasonable, since all human affairs are dependent
   upon faith, to believe God rather than men?  For who takes a voyage, or
   marries, or begets children, or casts seeds into the ground, without
   believing that better things will result, although the contrary might
   and sometimes does happen?"  See also Arnobius, adversus Gentes, II. 8;

   "The highest point of your wisdom is believe" (Eccles. Pol. V. lxiii.

   help is not needed for it, but because, as he has shewn in § 10, it
   consists in the mind's assent, and voluntary approval of the doctrines
   set before it:  but the latter is a pure gift of grace working in man

   Lecture VI.

   Concerning the Unity of God [819] .  On the Article, I Believe in One
   God.  Also Concerning Heresies.

   Isaiah xlv. 16, 17. (Sept.)

   Sanctify yourselves unto Me, O islands.  Israel is saved by the Lord
   with an everlasting salvation; they shall not be ashamed, neither shall
   they be confounded for ever, &c.

   1.  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ [820] .
   Blessed also be His Only-begotten Son [821] .  For with the thought of
   God let the thought of Father at once be joined, that the ascription of
   glory to the Father and the Son may be made indivisible.  For the
   Father hath not one glory, and the Son another, but one and the same,
   since He is the Father's Only-begotten Son; and when the Father is
   glorified, the Son also shares the glory with Him, because the glory of
   the Son flows from His Father's honour:  and again, when the Son is
   glorified, the Father of so great a blessing is highly honoured.

   2.  Now though the mind is most rapid in its thoughts, yet the tongue
   needs words, and a long recital of intermediary speech.  For the eye
   embraces at once a multitude of the starry quire;' but when any one
   wishes to describe them one by one, which is the Morning-star, and
   which, the Evening-star, and which each one of them, he has need of
   many words.  In like manner again the mind in the briefest moment
   compasses earth and sea and all the bounds of the universe; but what it
   conceives in an instant, it uses many words to describe [822] .  Yet
   forcible as is the example I have mentioned, still it is after all weak
   and inadequate.  For of God we speak not all we ought (for that is
   known to Him only), but so much as the capacity of human nature has
   received, and so much as our weakness can bear.  For we explain not
   what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge
   concerning Him.  For in what concerns God to confess our ignorance is
   the best knowledge [823] .  Therefore magnify the Lord with me, and let
   us exalt His Name together [824] ,--all of us in common, for one alone
   is powerless; nay rather, even if we be all united together, we shall
   yet not do it as we ought.  I mean not you only who are here present,
   but even if all the nurslings of the whole Church throughout the world,
   both that which now is and that which shall be, should meet together,
   they would not be able worthily to sing the praises of their Shepherd.

   3.  A great and honourable man was Abraham, but only great in
   comparison with men; and when he came before God, then speaking the
   truth candidly he saith, I am earth and ashes [825] .  He did not say
   earth,' and then cease, lest he should call himself by the name of that
   great element; but he added and ashes,' that he might represent his
   perishable and frail nature.  Is there anything, he saith, smaller or
   lighter than ashes?  For take, saith he, the comparison of ashes to a
   house, of a house to a city, a city to a province, a province to the
   Roman Empire, and the Roman Empire to the whole earth and all its
   bounds, and the whole earth to the heaven in which it is
   embosomed;--the earth, which bears the same proportion to the heaven as
   the centre to the whole circumference of a wheel, for the earth is no
   more than this in comparison with the heaven [826] :  consider then
   that this first heaven which is seen is less than the second, and the
   second than the third, for so far Scripture has named them, not that
   they are only so many, but because it was expedient for us to know so
   many only.  And when in thought thou hast surveyed all the heavens, not
   yet will even the heavens be able to praise God as He is, nay, not if
   they should resound with a voice louder than thunder.  But if these
   great vaults of the heavens cannot worthily sing God's praise, when
   shall earth and ashes,' the smallest and least of things existing, be
   able to send up a worthy hymn of praise to God, or worthily to speak of
   God, that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and holdeth the
   inhabitants thereof as grasshoppers [827] .

   4.  If any man attempt to speak of God, let him first describe the
   bounds of the earth.  Thou dwellest on the earth, and the limit of this
   earth which is thy dwelling thou knowest not:  how then shalt thou be
   able to form a worthy thought of its Creator?  Thou beholdest the
   stars, but their Maker thou beholdest not:  count these which are
   visible, and then describe Him who is invisible, Who telleth the number
   of the stars, and calleth them all by their names [828] .  Violent
   rains lately came pouring down upon us, and nearly destroyed us:
   number the drops in this city alone:  nay, I say not in the city, but
   number the drops on thine own house for one single hour, if thou
   canst:  but thou canst not.  Learn then thine own weakness; learn from
   this instance the mightiness of God:  for He hath numbered the drops of
   rain [829] , which have been poured down on all the earth, not only now
   but in all time.  The sun is a work of God, which, great though it be,
   is but a spot in comparison with the whole heaven; first gaze
   stedfastly upon the sun, and then curiously scan the Lord of the sun.
   Seek not the things that are too deep for thee, neither search out the
   things that are above thy strength:  what is commanded thee, think
   thereupon [830] .

   5.  But some one will say, If the Divine substance is incomprehensible,
   why then dost thou discourse of these things?  So then, because I
   cannot drink up all the river, am I not even to take in moderation what
   is expedient for me?  Because with eyes so constituted as mine I cannot
   take in all the sun, am I not even to look upon him enough to satisfy
   my wants?  Or again, because I have entered into a great garden, and
   cannot eat all the supply of fruits, wouldst thou have me go away
   altogether hungry?  I praise and glorify Him that made us; for it is a
   divine command which saith, Let every breath praise the Lord [831] .  I
   am attempting now to glorify the Lord, but not to describe Him, knowing
   nevertheless that I shall fall short of glorifying Him worthily, yet
   deeming it a work of piety even to attempt it at all.  For the Lord
   Jesus encourageth my weakness, by saying, No man hath seen God at any
   time [832] .

   6.  What then, some man will say, is it not written, The little ones'
   Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven [833]
   ?  Yes, but the Angels see God not as He is, but as far as they
   themselves are capable.  For it is Jesus Himself who saith, Not that
   any man hath seen the Father, save He which is of God, He hath seen the
   Father [834] .  The Angels therefore behold as much as they can bear,
   and Archangels as much as they are able; and Thrones and Dominions more
   than the former, but yet less than His worthiness:  for with the Son
   the Holy Ghost alone can rightly behold Him:  for He searcheth all
   things, and knoweth even the deep things of God [835] :  as indeed the
   Only-begotten Son also, with the Holy Ghost, knoweth the Father fully:
   For neither, saith He, knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he
   to whom the Son will reveal Him [836] .  For He fully beholdeth, and,
   according as each can bear, revealeth God through the Spirit:  since
   the Only-begotten Son together with the Holy Ghost is a partaker of the
   Father's Godhead.  He, who [837] was begotten knoweth Him who begat;
   and He Who begat knoweth Him who is begotten.  Since Angels then are
   ignorant (for to each according to his own capacity doth the
   Only-begotten reveal Him through the Holy Ghost, as we have said), let
   no man be ashamed to confess his ignorance.  I am speaking now, as all
   do on occasion:  but how we speak, we cannot tell:  how then can I
   declare Him who hath given us speech?  I who have a soul, and cannot
   tell its distinctive properties, how shall I be able to describe its
   Giver?

   7.  For devotion it suffices us simply to know that we have a God; a
   God who is One, a living [838] , an ever-living God; always like unto
   Himself [839] ; who has no Father, none mightier than Himself, no
   successor to thrust Him out from His kingdom:  Who in name is manifold,
   in power infinite, in substance uniform [840] .  For though He is
   called Good, and Just, and Almighty and Sabaoth [841] , He is not on
   that account diverse and various; but being one and the same, He sends
   forth countless operations of His Godhead, not exceeding here and
   deficient there, but being in all things like unto Himself.  Not great
   in loving-kindness only, and little in wisdom, but with wisdom and
   loving-kindness in equal power:  not seeing in part, and in part devoid
   of sight; but being all eye, and all ear, and all mind [842] :  not
   like us perceiving in part and in part not knowing; for such a
   statement were blasphemous, and unworthy of the Divine substance.  He
   foreknoweth the things that be; He is Holy, and Almighty, and excelleth
   all in goodness, and majesty, and wisdom:  of Whom we can declare
   neither beginning, nor form, nor shape.  For ye have neither heard His
   voice at any time, nor seen His shape [843] , saith Holy Scripture.
   Wherefore Moses saith also to the Israelites:  And take ye good heed to
   your own souls, for ye saw no similitude [844] .  For if it is wholly
   impossible to imagine His likeness, how shall thought come near His
   substance?

   8.  There have been many imaginations by many persons, and all have
   failed.  Some have thought that God is fire; others that He is, as it
   were, a man with wings, because of a true text ill understood, Thou
   shalt hide me under the shadow of Thy wings [845] .  They forgot that
   our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten, speaks in like manner
   concerning Himself to Jerusalem, How often would I have gathered thy
   children together even as a hen doth gather her chickens under her
   wings, and ye would not [846] .  For whereas God's protecting power was
   conceived as wings, they failing to understand this sank down to the
   level of things human, and supposed that the Unsearchable exists in the
   likeness of man.  Some again dared to say that He has seven eyes,
   because it is written, seven eyes of the Lord looking upon the whole
   earth [847] .  For if He has but seven eyes surrounding Him in part,
   His seeing is therefore partial and not perfect:  but to say this of
   God is blasphemous; for we must believe that God is in all things
   perfect, according to our Saviour's word, which saith, Your Father in
   heaven is perfect [848] :  perfect in sight, perfect in power, perfect
   in greatness, perfect in foreknowledge, perfect in goodness, perfect in
   justice, perfect in loving-kindness:  not circumscribed in any space,
   but the Creator of all space, existing in all, and circumscribed by
   none [849] .  Heaven is His throne, but higher is He that sitteth
   thereon:  and earth is His footstool [850] , but His power reacheth
   unto things under the earth.

   9.  One He is, everywhere present, beholding all things, perceiving all
   things, creating all things through Christ:  For all things were made
   by Him, and without Him was not anything made [851] .  A fountain of
   every good, abundant and unfailing, a river of blessings, an eternal
   light of never-failing splendour, an insuperable power condescending to
   our infirmities:  whose very Name we dare not hear [852] .  Wilt thou
   find a footstep of the Lord? saith Job, or hast thou attained unto the
   least things which the Almighty hath made [853] ?  If the least of His
   works are incomprehensible, shall He be comprehended who made them
   all?  Eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, neither have entered
   into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that
   love Him [854] .  If the things which God hath prepared are
   incomprehensible to our thoughts, how can we comprehend with our mind
   Himself who hath prepared them?  O the depth of the riches, and wisdom,
   and knowledge of God!  How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways
   past finding out [855] ! saith the Apostle.  If His judgments and His
   ways are incomprehensible, can He Himself be comprehended?

   10.  God then being thus great, and yet greater, (for even were I to
   change my whole substance into tongue, I could not speak His
   excellence:  nay more, not even if all Angels should assemble, could
   they ever speak His worth), God being therefore so great in goodness
   and majesty, man hath yet dared to say to a stone that he hath graven,
   Thou art my God [856] !  O monstrous blindness, that from majesty so
   great came down so low!  The tree which was planted by God, and
   nourished by the rain, and afterwards burnt and turned into ashes by
   the fire,--this is addressed as God, and the true God is despised.  But
   the wickedness of idolatry grew yet more prodigal, and cat, and dog,
   and wolf [857] were worshipped instead of God:  the man-eating lion
   [858] also was worshipped instead of God, the most loving friend of
   man.  The snake and the serpent [859] , counterfeit of him who thrust
   us out of Paradise, were worshipped, and He who planted Paradise was
   despised.  And I am ashamed to say, and yet do say it, even onions
   [860] were worshipped among some.  Wine was given to make glad the
   heart of man [861] :  and Dionysus (Bacchus) was worshipped instead of
   God.  God made corn by saying, Let the earth bring forth grass,
   yielding seed after his kind and after his likeness [862] , that bread
   may strengthen man's heart [863] :  why then was Demeter (Ceres)
   worshipped?  Fire cometh forth from striking stones together even to
   this day:  how then was Hephæstus (Vulcan) the creator of fire?

   11.  Whence came the polytheistic error of the Greeks [864] ?  God has
   no body:  whence then the adulteries alleged among those who are by
   them called gods?  I say nothing of the transformations of Zeus into a
   swan:  I am ashamed to speak of his transformations into a bull:  for
   bellowings are unworthy of a god.  The god of the Greeks has been found
   an adulterer, yet are they not ashamed:  for if he is an adulterer let
   him not be called a god.  They tell also of deaths [865] , and falls
   [866] , and thunder-strokes [867] of their gods.  Seest thou from how
   great a height and how low they have fallen?  Was it without reason
   then that the Son of God came down from heaven? or was it that He might
   heal so great a wound?  Was it without reason that the Son came? or was
   it in order that the Father might be acknowledged?  Thou hast learned
   what moved the Only-begotten to come down from the throne at God's
   right hand.  The Father was despised, the Son must needs correct the
   error:  for He Through Whom All Things Were Made must bring them all as
   offerings to the Lord of all.  The wound must be healed:  for what
   could be worse than this disease, that a stone should be worshipped
   instead of God?

   Of Heresies.

   12.  And not among the heathen only did the devil make these assaults;
   for many of those who are falsely called Christians, and wrongfully
   addressed by the sweet name of Christ, have ere now impiously dared to
   banish God from His own creation.  I mean the brood of heretics, those
   most ungodly men of evil name, pretending to be friends of Christ but
   utterly hating Him.  For he who blasphemes the Father of the Christ is
   an enemy of the Son.  These men have dared to speak of two Godheads,
   one good and one evil [868] !  O monstrous blindness!  If a Godhead,
   then assuredly good.  But if not good, why called a Godhead?  For if
   goodness is an attribute of God; if loving-kindness, beneficence,
   almighty power, are proper to God, then of two things one, either in
   calling Him God let the name and operation be united; or if they would
   rob Him of His operations, let them not give Him the bare name.

   13.  Heretics have dared to say that there are two Gods, and of good
   and evil two sources, and these unbegotten.  If both are unbegotten it
   is certain that they are also equal, and both mighty.  How then doth
   the light destroy the darkness?  And do they ever exist together, or
   are they separated?  Together they cannot be; for what fellowship hath
   light with darkness? saith the Apostle [869] .  But if they are far
   from each other, it is certain that they hold also each his own place;
   and if they hold their own separate places, we are certainly in the
   realm of one God, and certainly worship one God.  For thus we must
   conclude, even if we assent to their folly, that we must worship one
   God.  Let us examine also what they say of the good God.  Hath He power
   or no power?  If He hath power, how did evil arise against His will?
   And how doth the evil substance intrude, if He be not willing?  For if
   He knows but cannot hinder it, they charge Him with want of power; but
   if He has the power, yet hinders not, they accuse Him of treachery.
   Mark too their want of sense.  At one time they say that the Evil One
   hath no communion with the good God in the creation of the world; but
   at another time they say that he hath the fourth part only.  Also they
   say that the good God is the Father of Christ; but Christ they call
   this sun.  If, therefore according to them, the world was made by the
   Evil One, and the sun is in the world, how is the Son of the Good an
   unwilling slave in the kingdom of the Evil?  We bemire ourselves in
   speaking of these things, but we do it lest any of those present should
   from ignorance fall into the mire of the heretics.  I know that I have
   defiled my own mouth and the ears of my listeners:  yet it is
   expedient.  For it is much better to hear absurdities charged against
   others, than to fall into them from ignorance:  far better that thou
   know the mire and hate it, than unawares fall into it.  For the godless
   system of the heresies is a road with many branches, and whenever a man
   has strayed from the one straight way, then he falls down precipices
   again and again.

   14.  The inventor of all heresy was Simon Magus [870] :  that Simon,
   who in the Acts of the Apostles thought to purchase with money the
   unsaleable grace of the Spirit, and heard the words, Thou hast neither
   part nor lot in this matter [871] , and the rest:  concerning whom also
   it is written, They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if
   they had been of us, they would have remained with us [872] .  This
   man, after he had been cast out by the Apostles, came to Rome, and
   gaining over one Helena a harlot [873] , was the first that dared with
   blasphemous mouth to say that it was himself who appeared on Mount
   Sinai as the Father, and afterwards appeared among the Jews, not in
   real flesh but in seeming [874] , as Christ Jesus, and afterwards as
   the Holy Spirit whom Christ promised to send as the Paraclete [875] .
   And he so deceived the City of Rome that Claudius set up his statue,
   and wrote beneath it, in the language of the Romans, "Simoni Deo
   Sancto," which being interpreted signifies, "To Simon the Holy God
   [876] ."

   15.  As the delusion was extending, Peter and Paul, a noble pair, chief
   rulers of the Church, arrived and set the error right [877] ; and when
   the supposed god Simon wished to shew himself off, they straightway
   shewed him as a corpse.  For Simon promised to rise aloft to heaven,
   and came riding in a dæmons' chariot on the air; but the servants of
   God fell on their knees, and having shewn that agreement of which Jesus
   spake, that If two of you shall agree concerning anything that they
   shall ask, it shall be done unto them [878] , they launched the weapon
   of their concord in prayer against Magus, and struck him down to the
   earth.  And marvellous though it was, yet no marvel.  For Peter was
   there, who carrieth the keys of heaven [879] :  and nothing wonderful,
   for Paul was there [880] , who was caught up to the third heaven, and
   into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful far
   a man to utter [881] .  These brought the supposed God down from the
   sky to earth, thence to be taken down to the regions below the earth.
   In this man first the serpent of wickedness appeared; but when one head
   had been cut off, the root of wickedness was found again with many
   heads.

   16.  For Cerinthus [882] made havoc of the Church, and Menander [883] ,
   and Carpocrates [884] , Ebionites [885] also, and Marcion [886] , that
   mouthpiece of ungodliness.  For he who proclaimed different gods, one
   the Good, the other the Just, contradicts the Son when He says, O
   righteous Father [887] .  And he who says again that the Father is one,
   and the maker of the world another, opposes the Son when He says, If
   then God so clothes the grass of the field which to-day is, and
   to-morrow is cast into the furnace of fire [888] ; and, Who maketh His
   sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
   and on the unjust [889] .  Here again is a second inventor of more
   mischief, this Marcion.  For being confuted by the testimonies from the
   Old Testament which are quoted in the New, he was the first who dared
   to cut those testimonies out [890] , and leave the preaching of the
   word of faith without witness, thus effacing the true God:  and sought
   to undermine the Church's faith, as if there were no heralds of it.

   17.  He again was succeeded by another, Basilides, of evil name, and
   dangerous character, a preacher of impurities [891] .  The contest of
   wickedness was aided also by Valentinus [892] , a preacher of thirty
   gods.  The Greeks tell of but few:  and the man who was called--but
   more truly was not--a Christian extended the delusion to full thirty.
   He says, too, that Bythus the Abyss (for it became him as being an
   abyss of wickedness to begin his teaching from the Abyss) begat
   Silence, and of Silence begat the Word.  This Bythus was worse than the
   Zeus of the Greeks, who was united to his sister:  for Silence was said
   to be the child of Bythus.  Dost thou see the absurdity invested with a
   show of Christianity?  Wait a little, and thou wilt be shocked at his
   impiety; for he asserts that of this Bythus were begotten eight Æons;
   and of them, ten; and of them, other twelve, male and female.  But
   whence is the proof of these things?  See their silliness from their
   fabrications.  Whence hast thou the proof of the thirty Æons?  Because,
   saith he, it is written, that Jesus was baptized, being thirty years
   old [893] .  But even if He was baptized when thirty years old, what
   sort of demonstration is this from the thirty years?  Are there then
   five gods, because He brake five loaves among five thousand?  Or
   because he had twelve Disciples, must there also be twelve gods?

   18.  And even this is still little compared with the impieties which
   follow.  For the last of the deities being, as he dares to speak, both
   male and female, this, he says, is Wisdom [894] .  What impiety!  For
   the Wisdom of God [895] is Christ His Only-begotten Son:  and he by his
   doctrine degraded the Wisdom of God into a female element, and one of
   thirty, and the last fabrication.  He also says that Wisdom attempted
   to behold the first God, and not bearing His brightness fell from
   heaven, and was cast out of her thirtieth place.  Then she groaned, and
   of her groans begat the Devil [896] , and as she wept over her fall
   made of her tears the sea.  Mark the impiety.  For of Wisdom how is the
   Devil begotten, and of prudence wickedness, or of light darkness?  He
   says too that the Devil begat others, some of whom created the world:
   and that the Christ came down in order to make mankind revolt from the
   Maker of the world.

   19.  But hear whom they say Christ Jesus to be, that thou mayest detest
   them yet more.  For they say that after Wisdom had been cast down, in
   order that the number of the thirty might not be incomplete, the nine
   and twenty Æons contributed each a little part, and formed the Christ
   [897] :  and they say that He also is both male and female [898] .  Can
   anything be more impious than this?  Anything more wretched?  I am
   describing their delusion to thee, in order that thou mayest hate them
   the more.  Shun, therefore, their impiety, and do not even give
   greeting to [899] a man of this kind, lest thou have fellowship with
   the unfruitful works of darkness [900] :  neither make curious
   inquiries, nor be willing to enter into conversation with them.

   20.  Hate all heretics, but especially him who is rightly named after
   mania [901] , who arose not long ago in the reign of Probus [902] .
   For the delusion began full seventy years ago [903] , and there are men
   still living who saw him with their very eyes.  But hate him not for
   this, that he lived a short time ago; but because of his impious
   doctrines hate thou the worker of wickedness, the receptacle of all
   filth, who gathered up the mire of every heresy [904] .  For aspiring
   to become pre-eminent among wicked men, he took the doctrines of all,
   and having combined them into one heresy filled with blasphemies and
   all iniquity, he makes havoc of the Church, or rather of those outside
   the Church, roaming about like a lion and devouring.  Heed not their
   fair speech, nor their supposed humility:  for they are serpents, a
   generation of vipers [905] .  Judas too said Hail! Master [906] , even
   while he was betraying Him.  Heed not their kisses, but beware of their
   venom.

   21.  Now, lest I seem to accuse him without reason, let me make a
   digression to tell who this Manes is, and in part what he teaches:  for
   all time would fail to describe adequately the whole of his foul
   teaching.  But for help in time of need [907] , store up in thy memory
   what I have said to former hearers, and will repeat to those now
   present, that they who know not may learn, and they who know may be
   reminded.  Manes is not of Christian origin, God forbid! nor was he
   like Simon cast out of the Church, neither himself nor the teachers who
   were before him.  For he steals other men's wickedness, and makes their
   wickedness his own:  but how and in what manner thou must hear.

   22.  There was in Egypt one Scythianus [908] , a Saracen [909] by
   birth, having nothing in common either with Judaism or with
   Christianity.  This man, who dwelt at Alexandria and imitated the life
   of Aristotle [910] , composed four books [911] , one called a Gospel
   which had not the acts of Christ, but the mere name only, and one other
   called the book of Chapters, and a third of Mysteries, and a fourth,
   which they circulate now, the Treasure [912] .  This man had a
   disciple, Terebinthus by name.  But when Scythianus purposed to come
   into Judæa, and make havoc of the land, the Lord smote him with a
   deadly disease, and stayed the pestilence [913] .

   23.  But Terebinthus, his disciple in this wicked error, inherited his
   money and books and heresy [914] , and came to Palestine, and becoming
   known and condemned in Judæa [915] he resolved to pass into Persia:
   but lest he should be recognised there also by his name he changed it
   and called himself Buddas [916] .  However, he found adversaries there
   also in the priests of Mithras [917] :  and being confuted in the
   discussion of many arguments and controversies, and at last hard
   pressed, he took refuge with a certain widow.  Then having gone up on
   the housetop, and summoned the dæmons of the air, whom the Manichees to
   this day invoke over their abominable ceremony of the fig [918] , he
   was smitten of God, and cast down from the housetop, and expired:  and
   so the second beast was cut off.

   24.  The books, however, which were the records of his impiety,
   remained; and both these and his money the widow inherited.  And having
   neither kinsman nor any other friend, she determined to buy with the
   money a boy named Cubricus [919] :  him she adopted and educated as a
   son in the learning of the Persians, and thus sharpened an evil weapon
   against mankind.  So Cubricus, the vile slave, grew up in the midst of
   philosophers, and on the death of the widow inherited both the books
   and the money.  Then, lest the name of slavery might be a reproach,
   instead of Cubricus he called himself Manes, which in the language of
   the Persians signifies discourse [920] .  For as he thought himself
   something of a disputant, he surnamed himself Manes, as it were an
   excellent master of discourse.  But though he contrived for himself an
   honourable title according to the language of the Persians, yet the
   providence of God caused him to become a self-accuser even against his
   will, that through thinking to honour himself in Persia, he might
   proclaim himself among the Greeks by name a maniac.

   25.  He dared too to say that he was the Paraclete, though it is
   written, But whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath no
   forgiveness [921] .  He committed blasphemy therefore by saying that he
   was the Holy Ghost:  let him that communicates with those heretics see
   with whom he is enrolling himself.  The slave shook the world, since by
   three things the earth is shaken, and the fourth it cannot bear,--if a
   slave became a king [922] .  Having come into public he now began to
   promise things above man's power.  The son of the King of the Persians
   was sick, and a multitude of physicians were in attendance:  but Manes
   promised, as if he were a godly man, to cure him by prayer.  With the
   departure of the physicians, the life of the child departed:  and the
   man's impiety was detected.  So the would-be philosopher was a
   prisoner, being cast into prison not for reproving the king in the
   cause of truth, not for destroying the idols, but for promising to save
   and lying, or rather, if the truth must be told, for committing
   murder.  For the child who might have been saved by medical treatment,
   was murdered by this man's driving away the physicians, and killing him
   by want of treatment.

   26.  Now as there are very many wicked things which I tell thee of him,
   remember first his blasphemy, secondly his slavery (not that slavery is
   a disgrace, but that his pretending to be free-born, when he was a
   slave, was wicked), thirdly, the falsehood of his promise, fourthly,
   the murder of the child, and fifthly, the disgrace of the
   imprisonment.  And there was not only the disgrace of the prison, but
   also the flight from prison.  For he who called himself the Paraclete
   and champion of the truth, ran away:  he was no successor of Jesus, who
   readily went to the Cross, but this man was the reverse, a runaway.
   Moreover, the King of the Persians ordered the keepers of the prison to
   be executed:  so Manes was the cause of the child's death through his
   vain boasting, and of the gaolers' death through his flight.  Ought
   then he, who shared the guilt of murder, to be worshipped?  Ought he
   not to have followed the example of Jesus, and said, If ye seek Me, let
   these go their way [923] ?  Ought he not to have said, like Jonas, Take
   me, and cast me into the sea:  for this storm is because of me [924] ?

   27.  He escapes from the prison, and comes into Mesopotamia:  but there
   Bishop Archelaus, a shield of righteousness, encounters him [925] :
   and having accused him before philosophers as judges, and having
   assembled an audience of Gentiles, lest if Christians gave judgment,
   the judges might be thought to shew favour,--Tell us what thou
   preachest, said Archelaus to Manes.  And he, whose mouth was as an open
   sepulchre [926] , began first with blasphemy against the Maker of all
   things, saying, The God of the Old Testament is the author of evils, as
   He says of Himself, I am a consuming fire [927] .  But the wise
   Archelaus undermined his blasphemous argument by saying, "If the God of
   the Old Testament, as thou sayest, calls Himself a fire, whose Son is
   He who saith, I came to send fire on the earth [928] ?  If thou findest
   fault with Him who saith, The Lord killeth, and maketh alive [929] ,
   why dost thou honour Peter, who raised up Tabitha, but struck Sapphira
   dead?  If again thou findest fault, because He prepared fire, wherefore
   dost thou not find fault with Him who saith, Depart from Me into
   everlasting fire [930] ?  If thou findest fault with Him who saith, I
   am God that make peace, and create evil [931] , explain how Jesus
   saith, I came not to send peace but a sword [932] .  Since both speak
   alike, of two things one, either both are good, because of their
   agreement, or if Jesus is blameless in so speaking. why blamest thou
   Him that saith the like in the Old Testament?"

   28.  Then Manes answers him:  "And what sort of God causes blindness?
   For it is Paul who saith, In whom the God of this world hath blinded
   the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the Gospel should
   shine unto them [933] ."  But Archelaus made a good retort, saying,
   "Read a little before:  But if our Gospel is veiled, it is veiled in
   them that are perishing [934] .  Seest thou that in them that are
   perishing it is veiled?  For it is not right to give the things which
   are holy unto the dogs [935] .  Again, Is it only the God of the Old
   Testament that hath blinded the minds of them that believe not?  Hath
   not Jesus Himself said, For this cause speak I unto them in parables,
   that seeing they may not see [936] ?  Was it from hating them that He
   wished them not to see?  Or because of their unworthiness, since their
   eyes they had closed [937] .  For where there is wilful wickedness,
   there is also a withholding of grace:  for to him that hath shall be
   given; but from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he
   seemeth to have [938] .

   29.  "But if some are right in their interpretation, we must say as
   follows [939] (for it is no unworthy expression)--If indeed He blinded
   the thoughts of them that believe not he blinded them for a good
   purpose, that they might look with new sight on what is good.  For he
   said not, He blinded their soul, but, the thoughts of them that believe
   not [940] .  And the meaning is something of this kind:  Blind the lewd
   thoughts of the lewd, and the man is saved:  blind the grasping and
   rapacious thought of the robber, and the man is saved.'  But wilt thou
   not understand it thus?  Then there is yet another interpretation.  The
   sun also blinds those whose sight is dim:  and they whose eyes are
   diseased are hurt by the light and blinded.  Not that the sun's nature
   is to blind, but that the substance of the eyes is incapable of
   seeing.  In like manner unbelievers being diseased in their heart
   cannot look upon the radiance of the Godhead.  Nor hath he said, He
   hath blinded their thoughts, that they should not hear the Gospel:'
   but, that the light of the glory of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
   should not shine unto them.  For to hear the Gospel is permitted to
   all:  but the glory of the Gospel is reserved for Christ's true
   children only.  Therefore the Lord spoke in parables to those who could
   not hear [941] :  but to the Disciples he explained the parables in
   private [942] :  for the brightness of the glory is for those who have
   been enlightened, the blinding for them that believe not."  These
   mysteries, which the Church now explains to thee who art passing out of
   the class of Catechumens, it is not the custom to explain to heathen.
   For to a heathen we do not explain the mysteries concerning Father,
   Son, and Holy Ghost, nor before Catechumens do we speak plainly of the
   mysteries:  but many things we often speak in a veiled way, that the
   believers who know may understand, and they who know not may get no
   hurt [943] .

   30.  By such and many other arguments the serpent was overthrown:  thus
   did Archelaus wrestle with Manes and threw him.  Again, he who had fled
   from prison flees from this place also:  and having run away from his
   antagonist, he comes to a very poor village, like the serpent in
   Paradise when he left Adam and came to Eve.  But the good shepherd
   Archelaus taking forethought for his sheep, when he heard of his
   flight, straightway hastened with all speed in search of the wolf.  And
   when Manes suddenly saw his adversary, he rushed out and fled:  it was
   however his last flight.  For the officers of the King of Persia
   searched everywhere, and caught the fugitive:  and the sentence, which
   he ought to have received in the presence of Archelaus, is passed upon
   him by the king's officers.  This Manes, whom his own disciples
   worship, is arrested and brought before the king.  The king reproached
   him with his falsehood and his flight:  poured scorn upon his slavish
   condition, avenged the murder of his child, and condemned him also for
   the murder of the gaolers:  he commands him to be flayed after the
   Persian fashion.  And while the rest of his body was given over for
   food of wild beasts, his skin, the receptacle of his vile mind, was
   hung up before the gates like a sack [944] .  He that called himself
   the Paraclete and professed to know the future, knew not his own flight
   and capture.

   31.  This man has had three disciples, Thomas, and Baddas, and Hermas.
   Let none read the Gospel according to Thomas [945] :  for it is the
   work not of one of the twelve Apostles, but of one of the three wicked
   disciples of Manes.  Let none associate with the soul-destroying
   Manicheans, who by decoctions of chaff counterfeit the sad look of
   fasting, who speak evil of the Creator of meats, and greedily devour
   the daintiest, who teach that the man who plucks up this or that herb
   is changed into it.  For if he who crops herbs or any vegetable is
   changed into the same, into how many will husbandmen and the tribe of
   gardeners be changed [946] ?  The gardener, as we see, has used his
   sickle against so many:  into which then is he changed?  Verily their
   doctrines are ridiculous, and fraught with their own condemnation and
   shame!  The same man, being the shepherd of a flock, both sacrifices a
   sheep and kills a wolf.  Into what then is he changed?  Many men both
   net fishes and lime birds:  into which then are they transformed?

   32.  Let those children of sloth, the Manicheans, make answer; who
   without labouring themselves eat up the labourers' fruits:  who welcome
   with smiling faces those who bring them their food, and return curses
   instead of blessings.  For when a simple person brings them anything,
   "Stand outside a while," saith he, "and I will bless thee."  Then
   having taken the bread into his hands (as those who have repented and
   left them have confessed), "I did not make thee," says the Manichee to
   the bread:  and sends up curses against the Most High; and curses him
   that made it, and so eats what was made [947] .  If thou hatest the
   food, why didst thou look with smiling countenance on him that brought
   it to thee?  If thou art thankful to the bringer, why dost thou utter
   thy blasphemy to God, who created and made it?  So again he says, "I
   sowed thee not:  may he be sown who sowed thee!  I reaped thee not with
   a sickle:  may he be reaped who reaped thee!  I baked thee not with
   fire:  may he be baked who baked thee!"  A fine return for the
   kindness!

   33.  These are great faults, but still small in comparison with the
   rest.  Their Baptism I dare not describe before men and women [948] .
   I dare not say what they distribute to their wretched communicants
   [949] ....Truly we pollute our mouth in speaking of these things.  Are
   the heathen more detestable than these?  Are the Samaritans more
   wretched?  Are Jews more impious?  Are fornicators more impure [950] ?
   But the Manichee sets these offerings in the midst of the altar as he
   considers it [951] .  And dost thou, O man, receive instruction from
   such a mouth?  On meeting this man dost thou greet him at all with a
   kiss?  To say nothing of his other impiety, dost thou not flee from the
   defilement, and from men worse than profligates, more detestable than
   any prostitute?

   34.  Of these things the Church admonishes and teaches thee, and
   touches mire, that thou mayest not be bemired:  she tells of the
   wounds, that thou mayest not be wounded.  But for thee it is enough
   merely to know them:  abstain from learning by experience.  God
   thunders, and we all tremble; and they blaspheme.  God lightens, and we
   all bow down to the earth; and they have their blasphemous sayings
   about the heavens [952] .  These things are written in the books of the
   Manichees.  These things we ourselves have read, because we could not
   believe those who told of them:  yes, for the sake of your salvation we
   have closely inquired into their perdition.

   35.  But may the Lord deliver us from such delusion:  and may there be
   given to you a hatred against the serpent, that as they lie in wait for
   the heel, so you may trample on their head.  Remember ye what I say.
   What agreement can there be between our state and theirs?  What
   communion hath light with darkness [953] ?  What hath the majesty of
   the Church to do with the abomination of the Manichees?  Here is order,
   here is discipline [954] , here is majesty, here is purity:  here even
   to look upon a woman to lust after her [955] is condemnation.  Here is
   marriage with sanctity [956] , here steadfast continence, here
   virginity in honour like unto the Angels:  here partaking of food with
   thanksgiving, here gratitude to the Creator of the world.  Here the
   Father of Christ is worshipped:  here are taught fear and trembling
   before Him who sends the rain:  here we ascribe glory to Him who makes
   the thunder and the lightning.

   36.  Make thou thy fold with the sheep:  flee from the wolves:  depart
   not from the Church.  Hate those also who have ever been suspected in
   such matters:  and unless in time thou perceive their repentance, do
   not rashly trust thyself among them.  The truth of the Unity of God has
   been delivered to thee:  learn to distinguish the pastures of
   doctrine.  Be an approved banker [957] , holding fast that which is
   good, abstaining from every form of evil [958] .  Or if thou hast ever
   been such as they, recognise and hate thy delusion.  For there is a way
   of salvation, if thou reject the vomit, if thou from thy heart detest
   it, if thou depart from them, not with thy lips only, but with thy soul
   also:  if thou worship the Father of Christ, the God of the Law and the
   Prophets, if thou acknowledge the Good and the Just to be one and the
   same God. [959]   And may He preserve you all, guarding you from
   falling or stumbling, stablished in the Faith, in Christ Jesus our
   Lord, to Whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

   [819] Peri Theou Monarchias.  The word monarchia, as used by Plato
   (Polit. 291 C), Aristotle (Polit. III. xiv. 11.  eidos monarchias
   basilikes), Philo Judæus (de Circumcisione, § 2; de Monarchia, Titul.),
   means "sole government."  Compare Tertullian (adv. Praxean. c. iii.):
   "If I have gained any knowledge of either language, I am sure that
   Monarchia has no other meaning than single and individual rule.'"
   Athanasius (de Decretis Nicænæ Synodi, § 26) has preserved part of an
   Epistle of Dionysius, Bishop of Rome (259-269, a.d.), against the
   Sabellians:  "It will be natural for me now to speak against those who
   divide, and cut into pieces, and destroy that most sacred doctrine of
   the Church of God, the Monarchia, making it, as it were, three powers
   and divided hypostases, and three Godheads;" (ibid.):  "It is the
   doctrine of the presumptuous Marcion to sever and divide the Monarchia
   into three origins (archas)."  We see here the sense which Monarchia
   had acquired in  Christian Theology:  it meant the "Unity of God," as
   the one principle and origin of all things.  "By the Monarchy is meant
   the doctrine that the Second and Third Persons in the Ever-blessed
   Trinity are ever to be referred in our thoughts to the First, as the
   Fountain of Godhead" (Newman, Athanas. de Decretis Nic. Syn. § 26, note
   h).  Justin Martyr (Euseb. H.E. IV. 18), and Irenæus (ibid. V. 20), had
   each written a treatise peri Monarchias.  On the history of
   Monarchianism see, in this Series, Athanasius, Prolegomena, p. xxiii.
   sqq.

   [820] 2 Cor. i. 3.

   [821] This clause is omitted in some mss.  Various forms of the
   Doxology were adopted in Cyril's time by various parties in the
   Church.  Thus Theodoret (Hist. Eccles. II. c. 19) relates that
   Leontius, Bishop of Antioch, a.d. 348-357, observing that the Clergy
   and the Congregation were divided into two parties, the one using the
   form "and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost," the other "through the
   Son, in the Holy Ghost," used to repeat the Doxology silently, so that
   those who were near could hear only "world without end." The form which
   was regarded as the most orthodox, and adopted in the Liturgies ran
   thus:  "Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now
   and ever, and to the ages of the ages."  See Suicer's Thesaurus,
   Doxologia.

   [822] Irenæus II. xxviii. 4:  "But since God is all mind, all reason,
   all active Spirit, all light, and always exists as one and the same,
   such conditions and divisions (of operation) cannot fittingly be
   ascribed to Him.  For our tongue, as being made of flesh, is not able
   to minister to the rapidity of man's sense, because that is of a
   spiritual nature; for which reason our speech is restrained
   (suffocatur) within us, and is not at once expressed as it has been
   conceived in the mind but is uttered by successive efforts, just as the
   tongue is able to serve it."

   [823] Tertullian, Apologeticus, § 17:  "That which is infinite is known
   only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet
   beyond all our conceptions--our very incapacity of fully grasping Him
   affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds
   in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown."  Cf.
   Phil. Jud. de Monarch. i. 4:  Hooker, Eccles. Pol. I. ii. 3:  "Whom
   although to know be life, and joy to make mention of His name; yet our
   soundest knowledge is to know that we know Him not as He is, neither
   can know Him."

   [826] The opinion of Aristarchus of Samos, as stated by Archimedes
   (Arenarius, p. 320, Oxon), was that the sphere of the fixed stars was
   so large, that it bore to the earth's orbit the same proportion as a
   sphere to its centre, or more correctly (as Archimedes explains) the
   same proportion as the earth's orbit round the sun to the earth

   [857] The cat was sacred to the goddess Pasht, called by the Greeks
   Bubastis, and identified by Herodotus (ii. 137) with Artemis or Diana.
   Cats were embalmed after death, and their mummies are found at various
   places, but especially at Bubastis (Herod. ii. 67). "The Dogs are
   interred in the cities to which they belong, in sacred burial-places"
   (Herod. ii. 67), but chiefly at Cynopolis ("City of Dogs") where the
   dog-headed deity Anubis was worshipped. Mummies of wolves are found in
   chambers excavated in the rocks at Lycopolis, where Osiris was
   worshipped under the symbol of a wolf.

   [858] The lion was held sacred at Leontopolis (Strabo, xvii. p. 812).

   [859] "In the neighbourhood of Thebes there are sacred serpents
   perfectly harmless to man.  These they bury in the temple of Zeus, the
   god to whom they are sacred."  (Herod. ii. 74.) At Epidaurus in Argolis
   the serpent was held sacred as the symbol of Æsculapius.  Clement of
   Alexandria (Exhort. c. ii.) gives a fuller list of animals worshipped
   by various nations.  Compare also Clement. Recogn. V. 20.

   [860] Juvenal Sat. xv. 7. Illic aeluros, hic piscem fluminis, illic

   [864] The early Creeds of the Eastern Churches, like that which
   Eusebius of Cæsarea proposed at Nicæa, expressly declare the unity of
   God, in opposition both to the heathen Polytheism, and to the various
   heresies which introduced two or more Gods.  See below in this Lecture,
   §§ 12-18; and compare Athan. (contra Gentes, § 6, sqq.)

   [865] Clement of Alexandria (Exhort. cap. ii. § 37), quotes a passage
   from a hymn of Callimachus, implying the death of Zeus: "For even thy
   tomb, O king, The Cretans fashioned." Adonis, or "Thammuz yearly
   wounded," was said to live and die in alternate years.

   [866] By the word "falls" (apoptoseis) Cyril evidently refers to the
   story of Hephæstus, or Vulcan, to which Milton alludes (Paradise Lost,
   I. 740):-- "Men call'd him Mulciber, and how he fell From heaven they
   fabled, thrown by angry Jove Sheer o'er the crystal battlements:  from
   morn To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, A summer's day."

   [867] The "thunder-strokes" refer to "Titan heaven's first-born, With
   his enormous brood" (Par. Lost, I. 510).  Cf. Virgil, Æn. vi. 580:--
   "Hic genus antiquum Terræ, Titania pubes, Fulmine dejecti fundo
   volvuntur in imo." Ibid. v. 585:-- "Vidi et crudeles dantem Salmonea
   poenas, Dum flammas Jovis et sonitus imitatur Olympi." Clem. Alex.
   (Exhort. II. § 37):--"Æsculapius lies struck with lightning in the
   regions of Cynosuris."  Cf. Virg. Æn. vii. 770 ss.

   [868] The theory of two Gods, one good and the other evil, was held by
   Cerdo, and Marcion (Hippolytus, Refut. omnium Hær. VII. cap. 17:
   Irenæus, III. xxv. 3, quoted in note on Cat. iv. 4).  The Manichees
   also held that the Creator of the world was distinct from the Supreme
   God (Alexander Lycop. de Manichæorum Sententiis, cap. iii.).

   [869] 2 Cor. vi. 14.  Cyril's description applies especially to the
   heresy of Manes.  See § 36, note 3, at the end of this Lecture; also
   Cat. xi. 21. and Cat. xv. 3.

   [870] So Irenæus (I. xxiii. 2) says that "from this Simon of Samaria
   all kinds of heresies derive their origin."

   [871] Acts viii. 18-21.

   [872] 1 John ii. 19.

   [873] Irenæus (I. xxiii. 2):  "Having purchased from Tyre, a city of
   Phoenicia, a certain harlot named Helena, he used to carry her about
   with him, declaring that this woman was the first conception of his
   mind, the mother of all, by whom in the beginning he conceived in his
   mind the creation of Angels and Archangels."

   [874] Cf. Epiphan. (Hæres. p. 55, B):  "He said that he was the Son and
   had not really suffered, but only in appearance (dokesei)."

   [875] Irenæus (I. xxiii. 1):  "He taught that it was himself who
   appeared among the Jews as the Son, and descended in Samaria as the
   Father, but came to other nations as the Holy Spirit." Cyril here
   departs from his authority by substituting Mount Sinai for Samaria, and
   thereby falls into error.  Simon had first appeared in Samaria, being a
   native of Gitton:  moreover in claiming to be the Father he meant to
   set himself far above the inferior Deity who had given the Law on
   Sinai, saying that he was "the highest of all Powers, that is the
   Father who is over all."

   [876] "Justin Martyr in his first Apology, addressed to Antoninus Pius,
   writes thus (c. 26):  There was one Simon a Samaritan, of the village
   called Gitton, who in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, and in your royal
   city of Rome, did mighty feats of magic by the art of dæmons working in
   him.  He was considered a god, and as a god was honoured among you with
   a statue, which statue was set up in the river Tiber between the two
   bridges, and bears this inscription in Latin: Simoni Deo Sancto; which
   is, To Simon the holy God. "The substance of this story is repeated by
   Irenæus (adv. Hær. I. xxiii. 1), and by Tertullian (Apol. c. 13), who
   reproaches the Romans for installing Simon Magus in their Pantheon, and
   giving him a statue and the title Holy God.' "In a.d. 1574, a stone,
   which had formed the base of a statue, was dug up on the site described
   by Justin, the Island in the Tiber, bearing an inscription--Semoni
   Sanco Deo Fidio Sacrum, &c.'  Hence it has been supposed that Justin
   mistook a statue of the Sabine God, Semo Sancus,' for one of Simon
   Magus.  See the notes in Otto's Justin Martyr, and Stieren's Irenæus.
   "On the other hand Tillemont (Memoires, t. ii. p. 482) maintains that
   Justin in an Apology addressed to the emperor and written in Rome
   itself cannot reasonably be supposed to have fallen into so manifest an
   error.  Whichever view we take of Justin's accuracy concerning the
   inscription and the statue, there is nothing improbable in his
   statement that Simon Magus was at Rome in the reign of Claudius."
   (Extracted by permission from the Speaker's Commentary, Introduction to
   the Epistle to the Romans, p. 4.)

   [877] "Justin says not one word about St. Peter's alleged visit to
   Rome, and his encounter with Simon Magus."  But "Eusebius in his
   Ecclesiastical History (c. a.d. 325), quotes Justin Martyr's story
   about Simon Magus (E. H. ii. c. 13), and then, without referring to any
   authority, goes on to assert (c. 14) that immediately in the same reign
   of Claudius divine Providence led Peter the great Apostle to Rome to
   encounter this great destroyer of life,' and that he thus brought the
   light of the Gospel from the East to the West' (ibidem). Eusebius
   probably borrowed this story "from the strange fictions of the
   Clementine Recognitions and Homilies, and Apostolic Constitutions."
   See Recogn. III. 63-65; Hom. I. 15, III. 58; Apost. Constit. VI. 7, 8,
   9.  Cyril's account of Simon's death is taken from the same
   untrustworthy sources.

   [878] Matt. xviii. 19.

   [879] Ib. xvi. 19.

   [880] It is certain that S. Paul was not at Rome at this time.  This
   story of Simon Magus and his fiery car' is told, with variations, by
   Arnobius (adv. Gentes, II. 12), and in Apost. Constit. VI. 9.

   [881] 2 Cor. xii. 2, 4.

   [882] Cerinthus taught that the world was not made by the supreme God,
   but by a separate Power ignorant of Him.  See Irenæus, Hær. I. xxvi.,
   Euseb. E.H. iii. 28, with the notes in this Series.

   [883] Menander is first mentioned by Justin M. (Apolog. I. cap. 26):
   "Menander, also a Samaritan, of the town Capparetæa, a disciple of
   Simon, and inspired by devils, we know to have deceived many while he
   was in Antioch by his magical art.  He persuaded those who adhered to
   him that they should never die."  Irenæus (I. xxiii. 5) adds that
   Menander announced himself as the Saviour sent by the Invisibles, and
   taught that the world was created by Angels.  See also Tertullian (de
   Animâ, cap. 50.)

   [884] Carpocrates, a Platonic philosopher, who taught at Alexandria
   (125 a.d. circ.), held that the world and all things in it were made by
   Angels far inferior to the unbegotten (unknown) Father (Iren. I. xxv.
   1; Tertullian, Adv. Hær. cap. 3).

   [885] Irenæus, I. 26:  "Those who are called Ebionites agree that the
   world was made by God; but their opinions with respect to the Lord are
   like those of Cerinthus and Carpocrates."

   [886] On Marcion, see note 5, on Cat. iv. 4.

   [887] John xvii. 25.

   [888] Luke xii. 28.

   [889] Matt. v. 45.

   [890] Marcion accepted only St. Luke's Gospel, and mutilated that
   (Tertullian, Adv. Marcion. iv. 2).  He thus got rid of the testimony of
   the Apostles and eye-witnesses, Matthew and John, and represented the
   Law and the Gospel as contradictory revelations of two different Gods.
   For this Cyril calls him a second inventor of mischief,' Simon Magus (§
   14) being the first.

   [891] Basilides was earlier than Marcion, being the founder of a
   Gnostic sect at Alexandria in the reign of Hadrian (a.d. 117-138).  His
   doctrines are described by Irenæus (I. xxvii. 3-7), and very fully by
   Hippolytus (Refut. omn. Hær. VII. 2-15).  The charge of teaching
   licentiousness attaches rather to the later followers of Basilides than
   to himself or his son Isidorus (Clem. Alex. Stromat. III. cap. 1).
   Basilides wrote a Commentary on the Gospel in 24 books (Exegetica), of
   which the 23rd is quoted by Clement of Alexandria (Stromat. IV. cap.
   12), and against which Agrippa Castor wrote a refutation.  Origen (Hom.
   I. in Lucam.) says that Basilides wrote a Gospel bearing his own name.
   See Routh, Rell. Sacr. I. p. 85; V. p. 106:  Westcott, History of Canon
   of N.T. iv. § 3.

   [892] "The doctrines of Valentinus are described fully by Irenæus (I.
   cap. i.) from whom S. Cyril takes this account.  Valentinus, and
   Basilides, and Bardesanes, and Harmonious, and those of their company
   admit Christ's conception and birth of the Virgin, but say that God the
   Word received no addition from the Virgin, but made a sort of passage
   through her, as through a tube, and made use of a phantom in appearing
   to men."  (Theodoret, Epist. 145.)

   [893] Luke iii. 23.

   [894] Irenæus I. ii. 2.

   [895] 1 Cor. i. 24.

   [896] Irenæus, l. c., and Hippolytus, who gives an elaborate account of
   the doctrines of Valentinus (L. VI. capp. xvi.-xxxii.), both represent
   Sophia, "Wisdom," as giving birth not to Satan, but to a shapeless
   abortion, which was the origin of matter.  According to Irenæus (I. iv.
   2), Achamoth, the enthymesis of Sophia, gave birth to the Demiurge, and
   "from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed." In
   Tertullian's Treatise against the Valentinians chap. xxii., Achamoth is
   said as by Cyril to have given birth to Satan:  but in chap. xxiii.
   Satan seems to be identified (or interchanged) with the Demiurge.

   [897] The account in Irenæus (I. ii. 6) is rather different:  "The
   whole Pleroma of the Æons, with one design and desire, and with the
   concurrence of the Christ and the Holy Spirit, their Father also
   setting the seal of His approval on their conduct, brought together
   whatever each one had in himself of the greatest beauty and
   preciousness; and uniting all these contributions so as skilfully to
   blend the whole, they produced, to the honour and glory of Bythus, a
   being of most perfect beauty, the very star of the Pleroma, and its
   perfect fruit, namely Jesus." Tertullian, Against the Valentinians,
   chap. 12, gives a sarcastic description of this strange doctrine,
   deriving his facts (chap. 5) from Justin, Miltiades, "Irenæus, that
   very exact inquirer into all doctrines," and Proculus.

   [898] This statement does not agree with Irenæus (I. vii. 1), who says
   that the Valentinians represented the Saviour, that is Jesus, as
   becoming the bridegroom of Achamoth or Sophia.

   [899] 2 John 10, 11:  "Neither bid him God speed" (A.V.):  "give him no
   greeting" (R.V.).

   [900] Ephes. v. 11.

   [901] Eusebius in his brief notice of the Manichean heresy (Hist.
   Eccles. vii. 31) plays, like S. Cyril, upon the name Manes as well
   suited to a madman.

   [902] Marcus Aurelius Probus, Emperor a.d. 276-282, from being an
   obscure Illyrian soldier came to be universally esteemed the best and
   noblest of the Roman Emperors.

   [903] Routh (R.S. V. p. 12) comes to the conclusion that the famous
   disputation between Manes and Archelaus took place between July and
   December, a.d. 277.  Accordingly these Lectures, being "full 70 years"
   later, could not have been delivered before the Spring of a.d. 348.

   [904] Leo the Great (Serm. xv. cap. 4) speaks of the madness of the
   later Manichees as including all errors and impieties:  "all profanity
   of Paganism, all blindness of the carnal Jews, the illicit secrets of
   the magic art, the sacrilege and blasphemy of all heresies, flowed
   together in that sect as into a sort of cess-pool of all filth."  Leo
   summoned those whom they called the "elect," both men and women, before
   an assembly of Bishops and Presbyters, and obtained from these
   witnesses a full account of the execrable practices of the sect, in
   which, as he declares, "their law is lying, their religion the devil,
   their sacrifice obscenity."

   [905] Matt. iii. 7.

   [906] Ib. xxvi. 49.

   [907] Heb. iv. 16.

   [908] Cyril takes his account of Manes from the "Acta Archelai et
   Manetis Disputationis," of which Routh has edited the Latin translation
   together with the Fragments of the Greek preserved by Cyril in this
   Lecture and by Epiphanius.  There is an English translation of the
   whole in Clark's "Ante-Nicene Christian Library."

   [909] The Saracens are mentioned by both Pliny and Ptolemy.  See Dict.
   of Greek and Roman Geography.

   [910] There is no mention of Aristotle in the Acta Archelai, but
   Scythianus is stated (cap. li.) to have founded the sect in the time of
   the Apostles, and to have derived his duality of Gods from Pythagoras,
   and to have learned the wisdom of the Egyptians.

   [911] These four books are stated by Archelaus (Acta, cap. lii.), to
   have been written for Manes by his disciple Terebinthus.

   [912] In allusion to this name the history of the Disputation is called
   (Acta, cap. i.) "The true Treasure."

   [913] The true reading of this sentence, proairoumenon ton Skuthianon,
   instead of ton proeiremenon Sk., has been restored by Cleopas from the
   ms. in the Archiepiscopal library at Jerusalem.  This reading agrees
   with the statement in Acta Archel. cap. li.:  "Scythianus thought of
   making an excursion into Judæa, with the purpose of meeting all those
   who had a reputation there as teachers; but it came to pass that he
   suddenly departed this life, without having been able to make any
   progress."

   [914] This statement agrees with the reading of the Vatican ms. of the
   Acta Archelai, "omnibus quæcunque ejus fuerunt congregratis."

   [915] In the Acta there is no mention of Palestine, but only that he
   "set out for Babylonia, a province which is now held by the Persians."

   [916] Clem. Alex. (Strom. i. 15):  "Some also of the Indians obey the
   precepts of Boutta, and honour him as a god for his extraordinary

   [925] The account of the discussion in this and the two following
   chapters is not now found in the Latin Version of the "Disputation,"
   but is regarded by Dr. Routh as having been derived by Cyril from some
   different copies of the Greek.  The last paragraph of § 29, "These
   mysteries, &c.," is evidently a caution addressed to the hearers by
   Cyril himself (Routh, Rell. Sac. V. 199).

   [939] Instead of the reading of the Benedictine and earlier editions,

   Casaubon combine dei kai os into the one word dikaios, which is
   probably the right reading.  Something, however, is still wanted to
   complete the construction, and Petrus Siculus (circ. a.d. 870) who
   quotes the passage in his History of the Manichees, boldly conjectures
   esti kai houtos eipein.  A simpler emendation would be--ei de dikaios
   tines exegountai, dei touto eipein--which both completes the
   construction and explains the reading dei kai hos.

   Hist. I. 22, in this series.

   [945] The Gospel of Thomas, an account of the Childhood of Jesus, is
   extant in three forms, two in Greek and one in Latin:  these are all
   translated in Clark's Ante-Nicene Library.  The work is wrongly
   attributed by Cyril to a disciple of Manes, being mentioned long before
   Hippolytus (Refutation of all Heresies, V. 2) and by Origen (Hom. I. in
   Lucam):  "There is extant also the Gospel according to Thomas."

   [946] In the Disputation, § 9, Turbo describes these transformations:
   "Reapers must be transformed into hay, or beans, or barley, or corn, or
   vegetables, that they may be reaped and cut.  Again if any one eats
   bread, he must become bread, and be eaten.  If one kills a chicken, he
   will be a chicken himself.  If one kills a mouse, he also will be a
   mouse."

   [947] See Turbo's confession, Disput. § 9:  "And when they are going to
   eat bread, they first pray, speaking thus to the bread:  I neither
   reaped thee, nor ground thee, nor kneaded thee, nor cast thee into the
   oven:  but another did these things and brought thee to me, and I am
   not to blame for eating thee.'  And when he has said this to himself,
   he says to the Catechumen, I have prayed for thee,' and so he goes
   away."

   [948] On the rites of Baptism and Eucharist employed by the Manichees,
   see Dict. Chr. Biogr., Manicheans.

   [949] The original runs:  Ou tolmo eipein, tini embaptontes ten

   [951] hou nomizei.  The Manichees boasted of their superiority to the
   Pagans in not worshipping God with altars, temples, images, victims, or
   incense (August. contra Faustum XX. cap. 15).  Yet they used the names,
   as Augustine affirms (l. c. cap. 18):  "Nevertheless I wish you would
   tell me why you call all those things which you approve in your own
   case by these names, temple, altar, sacrifice."

   [956] semnotatos is the reading of the chief mss.  But the printed
   editions have semnotetos, comparing it with such phrases as stoma
   atheotetos (vi. 15), and metanoia tes soterias (xiv. 17).

   [957] This saying is quoted three times in the Clementine Homilies as
   spoken by our Lord.  See Hom. II. § 51; III. § 50; XVIII. § 20:  "Every
   man who wishes to be saved must become, as the Teacher said, a judge of
   the books written to try us.  For thus He spake:  Become experienced
   bankers.  Now the need of bankers arises from the circumstance that the
   spurious is mixed up with the genuine." On the same saying, quoted as
   Scripture in the Apostolic Constitutions (II. § 36), Cotelerius
   suggests that in oral tradition, or in some Apocryphal book, the
   proverb was said to come from the Old Testament, and was added by some
   transcriber as a gloss in the margin of Matt. xxv. 27, or Luke xix.
   23.  Dionysius of Alexandria, Epist. VII., speaks of "the Apostolic
   word, which thus urges all who are endowed with greater virtue, Be ye
   skillful money-changers,'" referring apparently as here to 1 Thess. v.
   21, 22, "try all things, &c."  (See Euseb. E.H. VII. ch. 6 in this
   series:  Suicer. Thesaurus, Trapezites:  and Resch. (Agrapha, pp.
   233-239.)

   [958] 1 Thess. v. 21, 22.

   [959] Compare § 13 of this Lecture, where Cyril seems to refer
   especially to the heresy of Manes, as described in the Disputatio
   Archelai, cap. 6:  "If you are desirous of being instructed in the
   faith of Manes, hear it briefly from me.  That man worships two gods,
   unbegotten, self-originate, eternal, opposed one to the other.  The one
   he represents as good, and the other as evil, naming the one Light, and
   the other Darkness."

   Lecture VII.

   The Father.

   Ephesians iii. 14, 15

   For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,...of whom all fatherhood
   in heaven and earth is named, &c.

   1.  Of God as the sole Principle we have said enough to you yesterday
   [960] :  by "enough" I mean, not what is worthy of the subject, (for to
   reach that is utterly impossible to mortal nature), but as much as was
   granted to our infirmity.  I traversed also the bye-paths of the
   manifold error of the godless heretics:  but now let us shake off their
   foul and soul-poisoning doctrine, and remembering what relates to them,
   not to our own hurt, but to our greater detestation of them, let us
   come back to ourselves, and receive the saving doctrines of the true
   Faith, connecting the dignity of Fatherhood with that of the Unity, and
   believing In One God the Father:  for we must not only believe in one
   God; but this also let us devoutly receive, that He is the Father of
   the Only-begotten, our Lord Jesus Christ.

   2.  For thus shall we raise our thoughts higher than the Jews [961] ,
   who admit indeed by their doctrines that there is One God, (for what if
   they often denied even this by their idolatries?); but that He is also
   the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, they admit not; being of a
   contrary mind to their own Prophets, who in the Divine Scriptures
   affirm, The Lord said unto me, Thou art My Son, this day have I
   begotten thee [962] .  And to this day they rage and gather themselves
   together against the Lord, and against His Anointed [963] , thinking
   that it is possible to be made friends of the Father apart from
   devotion towards the Son, being ignorant that no man cometh unto the
   Father but by [964] the Son, who saith, I am the Door, and I am the Way
   [965] .  He therefore that refuseth the Way which leadeth to the
   Father, and he that denieth the Door, how shall he be deemed worthy of
   entrance unto God?  They contradict also what is written in the
   eighty-eighth Psalm, He shall call Me, Thou art my Father, my God, and
   the helper of my salvation.  And I will make him my first-born, high
   among the kings of the earth [966] .  For if they should insist that
   these things are said of David or Solomon or any of their successors,
   let them shew how the throne of him, who is in their judgment described
   in the prophecy, is as the days of heaven, and as the sun before God,
   and as the moon established for ever [967] .  And how is it also that
   they are not abashed at that which is written, From the womb before the
   morning-star have I begotten thee [968] :  also this, He shall endure
   with the sun, and before the moon, from generation to generation [969]
   .  To refer these passages to a man is a proof of utter and extreme
   insensibility.

   3.  Let the Jews, however, since they so will, suffer their usual
   disorder of unbelief, both in these and the like statements.  But let
   us adopt the godly doctrine of our Faith, worshipping one God the
   Father of the Christ, (for to deprive Him, who grants to all the gift
   of generation, of the like dignity would be impious):  and let us
   Believe in One God the Father, in order that, before we touch upon our
   teaching concerning Christ, the faith concerning the Only-begotten may
   be implanted in the soul of the hearers, without being at all
   interrupted by the intervening doctrines concerning the Father.

   4.  For the name of the Father, with the very utterance of the title,
   suggests the thought of the Son:  as in like manner one who names the
   Son thinks straightway of the Father also [970] .  For if a Father, He
   is certainly the Father of a Son; and if a Son, certainly the Son of a
   Father.  Lest therefore from our speaking thus, In One God, the Father
   Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of All Things Visible and
   Invisible, and from our then adding this also, And in One Lord Jesus
   Christ, any one should irreverently suppose that the Only-begotten is
   second in rank to heaven and earth,--for this reason before naming them
   we named God the Father, that in thinking of the Father we might at the
   same time think also of the Son:  for between the Son and the Father no
   being whatever comes.

   5.  God then is in an improper sense [971] the Father of many, but by
   nature and in truth of One only, the Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus
   Christ; not having attained in course of time to being a Father, but
   being ever the Father of the Only-begotten [972] .  Not that being
   without a Son before, He has since by change of purpose become a
   Father:  but before every substance and every intelligence, before
   times and all ages, God hath the dignity of Father, magnifying Himself
   in this more than in His other dignities; and having become a Father,
   not by passion [973] , or union, not in ignorance, not by effluence
   [974] , not by diminution, not by alteration, for every good gift and
   every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of
   lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow of turning [975]
   .  Perfect Father, He begat a perfect Son, and delivered all things to
   Him who is begotten:  (for all things, He saith, are delivered unto Me
   of My Father [976] :)  and is honoured by the Only-begotten:  for, I
   honour My Father [977] , saith the Son; and again, Even as I have kept
   My Father's commandments, and abide in His love [978] .  Therefore we
   also say like the Apostle, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation [979]
   :  and, We bow our knees unto the Father from whom all fatherhood in
   heaven and on earth is named [980] :  glorifying Him with the
   Only-begotten:  for he that denieth the Father, denieth the Son also
   [981] :  and again, He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also
   [982] ; knowing that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
   Father [983] .

   6.  We worship, therefore, as the Father of Christ, the Maker of heaven
   and earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob [984] ; to whose honour
   the former temple also, over against us here, was built.  For we shall
   not tolerate the heretics who sever the Old Testament from the New
   [985] , but shall believe Christ, who says concerning the temple, Wist
   ye not that I must be in My Father's house [986] ? and again, Take
   these things hence, and make not my Father's house a house of
   merchandise [987] , whereby He most clearly confessed that the former
   temple in Jerusalem was His own Father's house.  But if any one from
   unbelief wishes to receive yet more proofs as to the Father of Christ
   being the same as the Maker of the world, let him hear Him say again,
   Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing, and not one of them shall
   fall on the ground without My Father which is in heaven [988] ; this
   also, Behold the fowls of the heaven that they sow not, neither do they
   reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them
   [989] ; and this, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work [990] .

   7.  But lest any one from simplicity or perverse ingenuity should
   suppose that Christ is but equal in honour to righteous men, from His
   saying, I ascend to My Father, and your [991] Father, it is well to
   make this distinction beforehand, that the name of the Father is one,
   but the power of His operation [992] manifold.  And Christ Himself
   knowing this has spoken unerringly, I go to My Father, and your
   Father:  not saying to our Father,' but distinguishing, and saying
   first what was proper to Himself, to My Father, which was by nature;
   then adding, and your Father, which was by adoption.  For however high
   the privilege we have received of saying in our prayers, Our Father,
   which art in heaven, yet the gift is of loving-kindness.  For we call
   Him Father, not as having been by nature begotten of Our Father which
   is in heaven; but having been transferred from servitude to sonship by
   the grace of the Father, through the Son and Holy Spirit, we are
   permitted so to speak by ineffable loving-kindness.

   8.  But if any one wishes to learn how we call God "Father," let him
   hear Moses, the excellent schoolmaster, saying, Did not this thy Father
   Himself buy thee, and make thee, and create thee [993] ?  Also Esaias
   the Prophet, And now, O Lord.  Thou art our Father:  and we all are
   clay, the works of Thine hands [994] .  For most clearly has the
   prophetic gift declared that not according to nature, but according to
   God's grace, and by adoption, we call Him Father.

   9.  And that thou mayest learn more exactly that in the Divine
   Scriptures it is not by any means the natural father only that is
   called father, hear what Paul says:--For though ye should have ten
   thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers:  for in Christ
   Jesus I begat you through the Gospel [995] .  For Paul was father of
   the Corinthians, not by having begotten them after the flesh, but by
   having taught and begotten them again after the Spirit.  Hear Job also
   saying, I was a father of the needy [996] :  for he called himself a
   father, not as having begotten them all, but as caring for them.  And
   God's Only-begotten Son Himself, when nailed in His flesh to the tree
   at the time of crucifixion, on seeing Mary, His own Mother according to
   the flesh, and John, the most beloved of His disciples, said to him,
   Behold! thy mother, and to her, Behold! thy Son [997] :  teaching her
   the parental affection due to him [998] , and indirectly explaining
   that which is said in Luke, and His father and His mother marvelled at
   Him [999] :  words which the tribe of heretics snatch up, saying that
   He was begotten of a man and a woman.  For like as Mary was called the
   mother of John, because of her parental affection, not from having
   given him birth, so Joseph also was called the father of Christ, not
   from having begotten Him (for he knew her not, as the Gospel says,
   until she had brought forth her first-born Son [1000] ), but because of
   the care bestowed on His nurture.

   10.  Thus much then at present, in the way of a digression, to put you
   in remembrance.  Let me, however, add yet another testimony in proof
   that God is called the Father of men in an improper sense.  For when in
   Esaias God is addressed thus, For Thou art our Father, though Abraham
   be ignorant of us [1001] , and Sarah travailed not with us [1002] ,
   need we inquire further on this point?  And if the Psalmist says, Let
   them be troubled from His countenance, the Father of the fatherless,
   and Judge of the widows [1003] , is it not manifest to all, that when
   God is called the Father of orphans who have lately lost their own
   fathers, He is so named not as begetting them of Himself, but as caring
   for them and shielding them.  But whereas God, as we have said, is in
   an improper sense the Father of men, of Christ alone He is the Father
   by nature, not by adoption:  and the Father of men in time, but of
   Christ before all time, as He saith, And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me
   with Thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the
   world was [1004] .

   11.  We believe then In One God the Father the Unsearchable and
   Ineffable, Whom no man hath seen [1005] , but the Only-begotten alone
   hath declared Him [1006] .  For He which is of God, He hath seen God
   [1007] :  whose face the Angels do alway behold in heaven [1008] ,
   behold, however, each according to the measure of his own rank.  But
   the undimmed vision of the Father is reserved in its purity for the Son
   with the Holy Ghost.

   12.  Having reached this point of my discourse, and being reminded of
   the passages just before mentioned, in which God was addressed as the
   Father of men, I am greatly amazed at men's insensibility.  For God
   with unspeakable loving-kindness deigned to be called the Father of
   men,--He in heaven, they on earth,--and He the Maker of Eternity, they
   made in time,--He who holdeth the earth in the hollow of His hand, they
   upon the earth as grasshoppers [1009] .  Yet man forsook his heavenly
   Father, and said to the stock, Thou art my father, and to the stone,
   Thou hast begotten me [1010] .  And for this reason, methinks, the
   Psalmist says to mankind, Forget also thine own people, and thy
   father's house [1011] , whom thou hast chosen for a father, whom thou
   hast drawn upon thyself to thy destruction.

   13.  And not only stocks and stones, but even Satan himself, the
   destroyer of souls, have some ere now chosen for a father; to whom the
   Lord said as a rebuke, Ye do the deeds of your father [1012] , that is
   of the devil, he being the father of men not by nature, but by fraud.
   For like as Paul by his godly teaching came to be called the father of
   the Corinthians, so the devil is called the father of those who of
   their own will consent unto him [1013] .

   For we shall not tolerate those who give a wrong meaning to that
   saying, Hereby know we the children of God, and the children of the
   devil [1014] , as if there were by nature some men to be saved, and
   some to be lost.  Whereas we come into such holy sonship not of
   necessity but by choice:  nor was the traitor Judas by nature a son of
   the devil and of perdition; for certainly he would never have cast out
   devils at all in the name of Christ:  for Satan casteth not out Satan
   [1015] .  Nor on the other hand would Paul have turned from persecuting
   to preaching.  But the adoption is in our own power, as John saith, But
   as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the children
   of God, even to them that believe in His name [1016] .  For not before
   their believing, but from their believing they were counted worthy to
   become of their own choice the children of God.

   14.  Knowing this, therefore, let us walk spiritually, that we may be
   counted worthy of God's adoption.  For as many as are led by the Spirit
   of God, they are the sons of God [1017] .  For it profiteth us nothing
   to have gained the title of Christians, unless the works also follow;
   lest to us also it be said, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do
   the works of Abraham [1018] .  For if we call on Him as Father, who
   without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, let
   us pass the time of our sojourning here in fear [1019] , loving not the
   world, neither the things that are in the world:  for if any man love
   the world, the love of the Father is not in him [1020] .  Wherefore, my
   beloved children, let us by our works offer glory to our Father which
   is in heaven, that they may see our good works, and glorify our Father
   which is in heaven [1021] .  Let us cast all our care upon Him, for our
   Father knoweth what things we have need of [1022] .

   15.  But while honouring our heavenly Father let us honour also the
   fathers of our flesh [1023] :  since the Lord Himself hath evidently so
   appointed in the Law and the Prophets, saying, Honour thy father and
   thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and thy days shall be long
   in the land [1024] .  And let this commandment be especially observed
   by those here present who have fathers and mothers.  Children, obey
   your parents in all things:  for this is well pleasing to the Lord
   [1025] .  For the Lord said not, He that loveth father or mother is not
   worthy of Me, lest thou from ignorance shouldest perversely mistake
   what was rightly written, but He added, more than Me [1026] .  For when
   our fathers on earth are of a contrary mind to our Father in heaven,
   then we must obey Christ's word.  But when they put no obstacle to
   godliness in our way, if we are ever carried away by ingratitude, and,
   forgetting their benefits to us, hold them in contempt, then the oracle
   will have place which says, He that curseth father or mother, let him
   die the death [1027] .

   16.  The first virtue of godliness in Christians is to honour their
   parents, to requite the troubles of those who begat them [1028] , and
   with all their might to confer on them what tends to their comfort (for
   if we should repay them ever so much, yet we shall never be able to
   return their gift of life [1029] ), that they also may enjoy the
   comfort provided by us, and may confirm us in those blessings which
   Jacob the supplanter shrewdly seized; and that our Father in heaven may
   accept [1030] our good purpose, and judge us worthy to shine amid
   righteous as the sun in the kingdom of our Father [1031] :  To whom be
   the glory, with the Only-begotten our Saviour Jesus Christ, and with
   the Holy and Life-giving Spirit, now and ever, to all eternity.  Amen.

   of a word in a derived or metaphorical sense.  See Aristotle's
   description of the various kinds of metaphor, Poet. § xxi. 7-16.  The
   opposite to katachrestikos is kurios, as used in a parallel passage by
   Athanasius, Oratio i. contra Arianos, § 21 fin.  "It belongs to the
   Godhead alone, that the Father is properly (kurios) Father, and the Son
   properly Son."

   [972] "And in Them, and Them only, does it hold, that the Father is
   ever Father, and the Son ever Son."  (Athan., as above.)

   [973] Compare vi. 6:  ho gennetheis apathos.  The importance attached
   to the assertion of a "passionless generation" arose from the
   objections offered by Eusebius of Nicomedia and others to the word
   homoousios when proposed by Constantine at Nicæa.  We learn from
   Eusebius of Cæsarea (Epist ad suæ paroeciæ homines, § 4) that the
   Emperor himself explained that the word was used "not in the sense of
   the affections (pathe) of bodies," because "the immaterial, and
   intellectual, and incorporeal nature could not be the subject of any
   corporeal affection."  Again, in § 7, Eusebius admits that "there are
   grounds for saying that the Son is one in essence' with the Father, not
   in the way of bodies, nor like mortal beings, for He is not such by
   division of essence, or by severance, no, nor by any affection, or
   alteration, or changing of the Father's essence and power."  (See the
   next note.)

   [974] Athanasius (Expos. Fidei, § 1):  "Word not pronounced nor mental,
   nor an effluence of the Perfect, nor a dividing of the passionless
   nature."  Also (de Decretis, § 11):  "God being without parts is Father
   of the Son without partition or passion; for there is neither effluence
   of the Immaterial, nor influx from without, as among men."

   Lecture VIII.

   Almighty.

   Jeremiah xxxix. 18, 19 (Septuagint).

   The Great, the strong God, Lord of great Counsel, and mighty in His
   works, the Great God, the Lord Almighty and of great name [1032] .

   1.  By believing In One God we cut off all misbelief in many gods,
   using this as a shield against Greeks; and every opposing power of
   heretics; and by adding, In One God the Father, we contend against
   those of the circumcision, who deny the Only-begotten Son of God.  For,
   as was said yesterday, even before explaining the truths concerning our
   Lord Jesus Christ, we made it manifest at once, by saying "The Father,"
   that He is the Father of a Son:  that as we understand that God is, so
   we may understand that He has a Son.  But to those titles we add that
   He is also "Almighty;" and this we affirm because of Greeks and Jews
   [1033] together, and all heretics.

   2.  For of the Greeks some have said that God is the soul of the world
   [1034] :  and others that His power reaches only to heaven, and not to
   earth as well.  Some also sharing their error and misusing the text
   which says, "And Thy truth unto the clouds [1035] ," have dared to
   circumscribe God's providence by the clouds and the heaven, and to
   alienate from God the things on earth; having forgotten the Psalm which
   says, If I go up into heaven, Thou art there, if I go down into hell,
   Thou art present [1036] .  For if there is nothing higher than heaven,
   and if hell is deeper than the earth, He who rules the lower regions
   reaches the earth also.

   3.  But heretics again, as I have said before, know not One Almighty
   God.  For He is Almighty who rules all things, who has power over all
   things.  But they who say that one God is Lord of the soul, and some
   other of the body, make neither of them perfect, because either is
   wanting to the other [1037] .  For how is he almighty, who has power
   over the soul, but not over the body?  And how is he almighty who has
   dominion over bodies, but no power over spirits?  But these men the
   Lord confutes, saying on the contrary, Rather fear ye Him which is able
   to destroy both soul and body in hell [1038] .  For unless the Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ has the power over both, how does He subject
   both to punishment?  For how shall He be able to take the body which is
   another's and cast it into hell, except He first bind the strong man,
   and spoil his goods [1039] ?

   4.  But the Divine Scripture and the doctrines of the truth know but
   One God, who rules all things by His power, but endures many things of
   His will.  For He rules even over the idolaters, but endures them of
   His forbearance:  He rules also over the heretics who set Him at
   nought, but bears with them because of His long-suffering:  He rules
   even over the devil, but bears with him of His long-suffering, not from
   want of power; as if defeated.  For he is the beginning of the Lord's
   creation, made to be mocked [1040] , not by Himself, for that were
   unworthy of Him, but by the Angels whom He hath made.  But He suffered
   him to live, for two purposes, that he might disgrace himself the more
   in his defeat, and that mankind might be crowned with victory.  O all
   wise providence of God! which takes the wicked purpose for a groundwork
   of salvation for the faithful.  For as He took the unbrotherly purpose
   of Joseph's brethren for a groundwork of His own dispensation, and, by
   permitting them to sell their brother from hatred, took occasion to
   make him king whom He would; so he permitted the devil to wrestle, that
   the victors might be crowned; and that when victory was gained, he
   might be the more disgraced as being conquered by the weaker, and men
   be greatly honoured as having conquered him who was once an Archangel.

   5.  Nothing then is withdrawn from the power of God; for the Scripture
   says of Him, for all things are Thy servants [1041] .  All things alike
   are His servants, but from all these One, His only Son, and One, His
   Holy Spirit, are excepted; and all the things which are His servants
   serve the Lord through the One Son and in the Holy Spirit.  God then
   rules all, and of His long-suffering endures even murderers and robbers
   and fornicators, having appointed a set time for recompensing every
   one, that if they who have had long warning are still impenitent in
   heart, they may receive the greater condemnation.  They are kings of
   men, who reign upon earth, but not without the power from above:  and
   this Nebuchadnezzar once learned by experience, when he said; For His
   kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His power from generation to
   generation [1042] .

   6.  Riches, and gold, and silver are not, as some think, the devil's
   [1043] :  for the whole world of riches is for the faithful man, but
   for the faithless not even a penny [1044] .  Now nothing is more
   faithless than the devil; and God says plainly by the Prophet, The gold
   is Mine, and the silver is Mine, and to whomsoever I will I give it
   [1045] .  Do thou but use it well, and there is no fault to be found
   with money: but whenever thou hast made a bad use of that which is
   good, then being unwilling to blame thine own management, thou
   impiously throwest back the blame upon the Creator.  A man may even be
   justified by money:  I was hungry, and ye gave Me meat [1046] :  that
   certainly was from money.  I was naked, and ye clothed Me:  that
   certainly was by money.  And wouldest thou learn that money may become
   a door of the kingdom of heaven?  Sell, saith He, that thou hast, and
   give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven [1047] .

   7.  Now I have made these remarks because of those heretics who count
   possessions, and money, and men's bodies accursed [1048] .  For I
   neither wish thee to be a slave of money, nor to treat as enemies the
   things which God has given thee for use.  Never say then that riches
   are the devil's:  for though he say, All these will I give thee, for
   they are delivered unto me [1049] , one may indeed even reject his
   assertion; for we need not believe the liar:  and yet perhaps he spake
   the truth, being compelled by the power of His presence:  for he said
   not, All these will I give thee, for they are mine, but, for they are
   delivered unto me.  He grasped not the dominion of them, but confessed
   that he had been entrusted [1050] with them, and was for a time
   dispensing them.  But at a proper time interpreters should inquire
   whether his statement is false or true [1051] .

   8.  God then is One, the Father, the Almighty, whom the brood of
   heretics have dared to blaspheme.  Yea, they have dared to blaspheme
   the Lord of Sabaoth [1052] , who sitteth above the Cherubim [1053] :
   they have dared to blaspheme the Lord Adonai [1054] :  they have dared
   to blaspheme Him who is in the Prophets the Almighty God [1055] .  But
   worship thou One God the Almighty, the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ.  Flee from the error of many gods, flee also from every heresy,
   and say like Job, But I will call upon the Almighty Lord, which doeth
   great things and unsearchable, glorious things and marvellous without
   number [1056] , and, For all these things there is honour from the
   Almighty [1057] :  to Whom be the glory for ever and ever.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1032] The text is translated from the Septuagint, in which S. Cyril
   found the title Almighty (Pantokrator), one of the usual equivalents in
   the Septuagint for Lord of Hosts (Sabaoth).  In the English A.V. and
   R.V. the passage stands thus:  Jer. xxxii. 18, 19:  The Great, the
   Mighty God, the LORD of Hosts, is His name, Great in counsel, and
   mighty in work.

   [1033] "For even the Jewish nation had wicked heresies:  for of them
   were...the Pharisees, who ascribe the practice of sinners to fortune
   and fate; and the Basmotheans, who deny providence and say that the
   world is made by spontaneous motion" (Apost. Const. VI. 6).  Compare
   Euseb. (E.H. IV. 22.)

   [1034] Cicero, De Natura Deorum, Lib. I. 27:  "Pythagoras thought that
   God was the soul pervading all nature."  The doctrine was accepted both
   by Stoics and Platonists, and became very general.  Cf. Virg. Georg.
   iv. 221: Deum namque ire per omnis Terrasque, tractusque maris,
   cælumque profundum. and Æn. vi. 726: Spiritus intus alit, totamque
   infusa per artus Meus agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.

   [1035] Ps. xxxvi. 5.  Cyril appears to have borrowed this statement
   from Clement of Alexandria, who states (Stromat. V. xiv. § 91) that
   from this Psalm the thought occurred to Aristotle to let Providence
   come down as far as to the Moon.

   [1036] Ps. cxxxix. 8.

   [1037] See note on Lect. IV. 4.

   [1038] Matt. x. 28.

   [1039] Ib. xii. 29.

   [1040] Job xl. 14, tout' estin arche plasmatos Kuriou, pepoiemenon
   enkatapaizesthai hupo ton angelon autou.  In this description of
   Behemoth the Septuagint differs much from the Hebrew, which is thus
   rendered in our English Versions, xl. 19:  He is the chief of the ways
   of God:  he (only, R.V.) that made him can make his sword to approach
   unto him.  Compare Job xli. 5:  Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
   and Ps. civ. 26:  There is that Leviathan whom thou hast formed to play
   therein (Sept. to take thy pastime with him).  See Baruch iii. 17, with
   the note in the Speaker's Commentary.

   [1041] Ps. cxix. 91.

   [1042] Dan. iv. 34.

   [1043] On this doctrine of the Manicheans see Archelaus (Disputatio,
   cap. 42), Epiphanius (Hæres. lxvi. § 81).  Compare Clement. Hom. xv.
   cap. 9:  "To all of us possessions are sins."  Plato (Laws, V. 743):
   "I can never agree with them that the rich man will be really happy,
   unless he is also good:  but for one who is eminently good to be also
   extremely rich is impossible."

   [1044] Prov. xvii. 6, according to the Septuagint.  See note on Cat. V.
   2, where the same passage is quoted.  Clement of Alexandria (Stromat.
   II. 5) refers to it in connexion with the passage of Plato quoted in
   the preceding note.  S. Augustine also quotes and explains it in Epist.
   153, § 26.

   [1045] The former clause is from Haggai ii. 8; the latter, taken from
   the words of the Tempter in Luke iv. 6, is quoted both by Cyril and by
   other Fathers as if from Haggai.  Chrysostom (Hom. xxxiv. § 5, in 1
   Cor. xiii.) treats the use which some made of the misquotation as
   ridiculous.

   [1046] Matt. xxv. 35, 36.

   [1047] Ib. xix. 21.

   [1048] The connexion of somata with money and possessions suggests the
   not uncommon meaning "slaves."  See Polyb. xviii. 18 § 6:  kai ten
   endouchian apedonto kai ta somata, kai sun toutois eti tinas ton
   kteseon, "household furniture, and slaves, and besides these some also
   of their lands."  See Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, "Slavery,"
   where it is shewn that Christians generally and even Bishops still
   possessed slaves throughout the 4th Century. But here it is perhaps
   more probable that Cyril refers, as before, Cat. iv. § 23, to the
   Manichean doctrine of the body as the root of sin.

   [1049] Matt. iv. 9; Luke iv. 6.

   [1050] For enkecheiresthai, the reading of all the printed Editions,
   which hardly yields a suitable sense, we should probably substitute
   enkecheiristhai.  A similar confusion of the two verbs occurs in
   Polybius (Hist. VIII. xviii. 6); the proper use of the latter is seen
   in Joh. Damasc. (De Fide Orthod. II. 4, quoted by Cleopas), who speaks
   of Satan as being "of these Angelic powers the chief of the earthly
   order, and entrusted by God with the guardianship of the earth" (tes
   ges ten phulaken encheiristheis para Theou).

   [1051] On this point compare Irenæus (Hær. V. xxi.-xxiv.), and Gregory
   of Nyssa (Orat. Catech. § 5).

   [1052] The reference is to Manes, of whom his disciple Turbo says
   (Archelai Disput. § 10), "the name Sabaoth, which is honourable and
   mighty with you, he declares to be the nature of man, and the parent of
   lust:  for which reason the simple, he says, worship lust, and think it
   to be a god."

   [1053] Ps. lxxx. 1.

   [1054] 'Adonai, Heb. ynd', "the Lord," an old form of the Plural of
   majesty, used of God only.

   [1055] pantokratora, Heb. yds l'", El-Shaddai, "God Almighty."

   [1056] Job v. 8, 9.  Cyril's quotation agrees with the Codex
   Alexandrinus of the Septuagint, which has pantokratora , "Almighty,"
   while the Vatican and other mss. read ton panton despoten.

   [1057] Job xxxvii. 23:  God hath upon Him terrible majesty (R.V.).  The
   Vatican and Alexandrine mss. of the Septuagint read epi toutois megale
   he doxa kai time pantokratoros.  (For these things great is the glory
   and honour of the Almighty.)  But Cyril's text is the same as the
   Aldine and Complutensian.

   Lecture IX.

   On the Words, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of All Things Visible and
   Invisible.

   Job xxxviii. 2-3

   Who is this that hideth counsel from Me, and keepeth words in his
   heart, and thinketh to hide them from Me [1058] ?

   1.  To look upon God with eyes of flesh is impossible:  for the
   incorporeal cannot be subject to bodily sight:  and the Only begotten
   Son of God Himself hath testified, saying, No man hath seen God at any
   time [1059] .  For if according to that which is written in Ezekiel any
   one should understand that Ezekiel saw Him, yet what saith the
   Scripture?  He saw the likeness of the glory of the Lord [1060] ; not
   the Lord Himself, but the likeness of His glory, not the glory itself,
   as it really is.  And when he saw merely the likeness of the glory, and
   not the glory itself, he fell to the earth from fear.  Now if the sight
   of the likeness of the glory brought fear and distress upon the
   prophets, any one who should attempt to behold God Himself would to a
   certainty lose his life, according to the saying, No man shall see My
   face and live [1061] .  For this cause God of His great loving-kindness
   spread out the heaven as a veil of His proper Godhead, that we should
   not perish.  The word is not mine, but the Prophet's.  If Thou shalt
   rend the heavens, trembling will take hold of the mountains at sight of
   Thee, and they will flow down [1062] .  And why dost thou wonder that
   Ezekiel fell down on seeing the likeness of the glory? when Daniel at
   the sight of Gabriel, though but a servant of God, straightway
   shuddered and fell on his face, and, prophet as he was, dared not
   answer him, until the Angel transformed himself into the likeness of a
   son of man [1063] .  Now if the appearing of Gabriel wrought trembling
   in the Prophets, had God Himself been seen as He is, would not all have
   perished?

   2.  The Divine Nature then it is impossible to see with eyes of flesh:
   but from the works, which are Divine, it is possible to attain to some
   conception of His power, according to Solomon, who says, For by the
   greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the Maker of them
   is seen [1064] .  He said not that from the creatures the Maker is
   seen, but added proportionably.  For God appears the greater to every
   man in proportion as he has grasped a larger survey of the creatures:
   and when his heart is uplifted by that larger survey, he gains withal a
   greater conception of God.

   3.  Wouldest thou learn that to comprehend the nature of God is
   impossible?  The Three Children in the furnace of fire, as they hymn
   the praises of God, say Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and
   sittest upon the Cherubim [1065] .  Tell me what is the nature of the
   Cherubim, and then look upon Him who sitteth upon them.  And yet
   Ezekiel the Prophet even made a description of them, as far as was
   possible, saying that every one has four faces, one of a man, another
   of a lion, another of an eagle, and another of a calf; and that each
   one had six wings [1066] , and they had eyes on all sides; and that
   under each one was a wheel of four sides.  Nevertheless though the
   Prophet makes the explanation, we cannot yet understand it even as we
   read.  But if we cannot understand the throne, which he has described,
   how shall we be able to comprehend Him who sitteth thereon, the
   Invisible and Ineffable God?  To scrutinise then the nature of God is
   impossible:  but it is in our power to send up praises of His glory for
   His works that are seen.

   4.  These things I say to you because of the following context of the
   Creed, and because we say, We Believe in One God, the Father Almighty,
   Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of All Things Visible and Invisible; in
   order that we may remember that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is
   the same as He that made the heaven and the earth [1067] , and that we
   may make ourselves safe against the wrong paths of the godless
   heretics, who have dared to speak evil of the All wise Artificer of all
   this world [1068] , men who see with eyes of flesh, but have the eyes
   of their understanding blinded.

   5.  For what fault have they to find with the vast creation of
   God?--they, who ought to have been struck with amazement on beholding
   the vaultings of the heavens:  they, who ought to have worshipped Him
   who reared the sky as a dome, who out of the fluid nature of the waters
   formed the stable substance of the heaven.  For God said, Let there be
   a firmament in the midst of the water [1069] .  God spake once for all,
   and it stands fast, and falls not.  The heaven is water, and the orbs
   therein, sun, moon, and stars are of fire:  and how do the orbs of fire
   run their course in the water?  But if any one disputes this because of
   the opposite natures of fire and water, let him remember the fire which
   in the time of Moses in Egypt flamed amid the hail, and observe the
   all-wise workmanship of God.  For since there was need of water,
   because the earth was to be tilled, He made the heaven above of water
   that when the region of the earth should need watering by showers, the
   heaven might from its nature be ready for this purpose.

   6.  But what?  Is there not cause to wonder when one looks at the
   constitution of the sun?  For being to the sight as it were a small
   body he contains a mighty power; appearing from the East, and sending
   forth his light unto the West:  whose rising at dawn the Psalmist
   described, saying:  And he cometh forth out of his chamber as a
   bridegroom [1070] .  He was describing the brightness and moderation of
   his state on first becoming visible unto men:  for when he rides at
   high noon, we often flee from his blaze:  but at his rising he is
   welcome to all as a bridegroom to look on.

   Observe also his arrangement (or rather not his, but the arrangement of
   Him who by an ordinance determined his course), how in summer he rises
   higher and makes the days longer, giving men good time for their
   works:  but in winter contracts his course, that the period of cold may
   be increased, and that the nights becoming longer may contribute to
   men's rest, and contribute also to the fruitfulness of the products of
   the earth [1071] .  See also how the days alternately respond each to
   other in due order, in summer increasing, and in winter diminishing;
   but in spring and autumn granting equal intervals one to another.  And
   the nights again complete the like courses; so that the Psalmist also
   says of them, Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night
   proclaimeth knowledge [1072] .  For to the heretics who have no ears,
   they all but cry aloud, and by their good order say, that there is none
   other God save the Creator who hath set them their bounds, and laid out
   the order of the Universe [1073] .

   7.  But let no one tolerate any who say that one is the Creator of the
   light, and another of darkness [1074] :  for let him remember how
   Isaiah says, I am the God who made the light, and created darkness
   [1075] .  Why, O man, art thou vexed thereat?  Why art thou offended at
   the time that is given thee for rest [1076] ?  A servant would have had
   no rest from his masters, had not the darkness necessarily brought a
   respite.  And often after wearying ourselves in the day, how are we
   refreshed in the night, and he who was yesterday worn with toils, rises
   vigorous in the morning because of the night's rest [1077] ?  And what
   more helpful to wisdom than the night [1078] ?  For herein oftentimes
   we set before our minds the things of God; and herein we read and
   contemplate the Divine Oracles.  And when is our mind most attuned to
   Psalmody and Prayer?  Is it not at night?  And when have we often
   called our own sins to remembrance?  Is not at night [1079] ?  Let us
   not then admit the evil thought, that another is the maker of
   darkness:  for experience shews that this also is good and useful.

   8.  They ought to have felt astonishment and admiration not only at the
   arrangement of sun and moon, but also at the well-ordered choirs of the
   stars, their unimpeded courses, and their risings in the seasons due to
   each:  and how some are signs of summer, and others of winter; and how
   some mark the season for sowing, and others shew the commencement of
   navigation [1080] .  And a man sitting in his ship, and sailing amid
   the boundless waves, steers his ship by looking at the stars.  For of
   these matters the Scripture says well, And let them be for signs, and
   for seasons, and for years [1081] , not for fables of astrology and
   nativities.  But observe how He has also graciously given us the light
   of day by gradual increase:  for we do not see the sun at once arise;
   but just a little light runs on before, in order that the pupil of the
   eye may be enabled by previous trial to look upon his stronger beam:
   see also how He has relieved the darkness of the night by rays of
   moonlight.

   9.  Who is the father of the rain?  And who hath begotten the drops of
   dew [1082] ?  Who condensed the air into clouds, and bade them carry
   the waters of the rain [1083] , now bringing golden-tinted clouds from
   the north [1084] , now changing these into one uniform appearance, and
   again transforming them into manifold circles and other shapes?  Who
   can number the clouds in wisdom [1085] ?  Whereof in Job it saith, And
   He knoweth the separations of the clouds [1086] , and hath bent down
   the heaven to the earth [1087] :  and, He who numbereth the clouds in
   wisdom:  and, the cloud is not rent under Him [1088] .  For so many
   measures of waters lie upon the clouds, yet they are not rent:  but
   come down with all good order upon the earth.  Who bringeth the winds
   out of their treasuries [1089] ?  And who, as we said before, is he
   that hath begotten the drops of dew?  And out of whose womb cometh the
   ice [1090] ?  For its substance is like water, and its strength like
   stone.  And at one time the water becomes snow like wool, at another it
   ministers to Him who scattereth the mist like ashes [1091] , and at
   another it is changed into a stony substance; since He governs the
   waters as He will [1092] .  Its nature is uniform, and its action
   manifold in force.  Water becomes in vines wine that maketh glad the
   heart of man:  and in olives oil that maketh man's face to shine:  and
   is transformed also into bread that strengtheneth man's heart [1093] ,
   and into fruits of all kinds which He hath created [1094] .

   10.  What should have been the effect of these wonders?  Should the
   Creator have been blasphemed?  Or worshipped rather?  And so far I have
   said noticing of the unseen works of His wisdom.  Observe, I pray you,
   the spring, and the flowers of every kind in all their likeness still
   diverse one from another; the deepest crimson of the rose, and the
   purest whiteness of the lily:  for these spring from the same rain and
   the same earth, and who makes them to differ?  Who fashions them?
   Observe, pray, the exact care:  from the one substance of the tree
   there is part for shelter, and part for divers fruits:  and the
   Artificer is One.  Of the same vine part is for burning [1095] , and
   part for shoots, and part for leaves, and part for tendrils, and part
   for clusters.

   Admire also the great thickness of the knots which run round the reed,
   as the Artificer hath made them.  From one and the same earth come
   forth creeping things, and wild beasts, and cattle, and trees, and
   food; and gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and stone.  The nature
   of the waters is but one, yet from it comes the substance of fishes and
   of birds; whereby [1096] as the former swim in the waters, so the birds
   fly in the air.

   11.  This great and wide sea, therein are things creeping innumerable
   [1097] .  Who can describe the beauty of the fishes that are therein?
   Who can describe the greatness of the whales, and the nature [1098] of
   its amphibious animals, how they live both on dry land and in the
   waters?  Who can tell the depth and the breadth of the sea, or the
   force of its enormous waves?  Yet it stays at its bounds, because of
   Him who said, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further, but within
   thyself shall thy waves be broken [1099] .  Which sea also clearly
   shews the word of the command imposed upon it, since after it has run
   up, it leaves upon the beach a visible line made by the waves, shewing,
   as it were, to those who see it, that it has not passed its appointed
   bounds.

   12.  Who can discern the nature of the birds of the air?  How some
   carry with them a voice of melody, and others are variegated with all
   manner of painting on their wings, and others fly up into mid air and
   float motionless, as the hawk:  for by the Divine command the hawk
   spreadeth out his wings and floateth motionless, looking towards the
   south [1100] .  What man can behold the eagle's lofty flight?  If then
   thou canst not discern the soaring of the most senseless of the birds,
   how wouldest thou understand the Maker of all?

   13.  Who among men knows even the names of all wild beasts?  Or who can
   accurately discern the physiology of each?  But if of the wild beasts
   we know not even the mere names, how shall we comprehend the Maker of
   them?  God's command was but one, which said, Let the earth bring forth
   wild beasts, and cattle, and creeping things, after their kinds [1101]
   and from one earth [1102] , by one command, have sprung diverse
   natures, the gentle sheep and the carnivorous lion, and various
   instincts [1103] of irrational animals, bearing resemblance to the
   various characters of men; the fox to manifest the craft that is in
   men, and the snake the venomous treachery of friends, and the neighing
   horse the wantonness of young men [1104] , and the laborious ant, to
   arouse the sluggish and the dull:  for when a man passes his youth in
   idleness, then he is instructed by the irrational animals, being
   reproved by the divine Scripture saying, Go to the ant, thou sluggard,
   see and emulate her ways, and become wiser than she [1105] .  For when
   thou seest her treasuring up her food in good season, imitate her, and
   treasure up for thyself fruits of good works for the world to come.
   And again, Go to the bee, and learn how industrious she is [1106] :
   how, hovering round all kinds of flowers, she collects her honey for
   thy benefit:  that thou also, by ranging over the Holy Scriptures,
   mayest lay hold of salvation for thyself, and being filled with them
   mayest say, How sweet are thy words unto my throat, yea sweeter than
   honey and the honeycomb unto my mouth [1107] .

   14.  Is not then the Artificer worthy the rather to be glorified?  For
   what?  If thou knowest not the nature of all things, do the things that
   have been made forthwith become useless?  Canst thou know the efficacy
   of all herbs?  Or canst thou learn all the benefit which proceeds from
   every animal?  Ere now even from venomous adders have come antidotes
   for the preservation of men [1108] .  But thou wilt say to me, "The
   snake is terrible."  Fear thou the Lord, and it shall not be able to
   hurt thee.  "A scorpion stings."  Fear the Lord, and it shall not sting
   thee.  "A lion is bloodthirsty."  Fear thou the Lord, and he shall lie
   down beside thee, as by Daniel.  But truly wonderful also is the action
   of the animals:  how some, as the scorpion, have the sharpness in a
   sting; and others have their power in their teeth; and others do battle
   with their claws; while the basilisk's power is his gaze [1109] .  So
   then from this varied workmanship understand the Creator's power.

   15.  But these things perhaps thou knowest not:  thou wouldest have
   nothing in common with the creatures which are without thee.  Enter now
   into thyself, and from thine own nature consider its Artificer.  What
   is there to find fault with in the framing of thy body?  Be master of
   thyself, and nothing evil shall proceed from any of thy members.  Adam
   was at first without clothing in Paradise with Eve, but it was not
   because of his members that he deserved to be cast out.  The members
   then are not the cause of sin, but they who use their members amiss;
   and the Maker thereof is wise.  Who prepared the recesses of the womb
   for child-bearing?  Who gave life to the lifeless thing within it?  Who
   knitted us with sinews and bones, and clothed us with skin and flesh
   [1110] , and, as soon as the child was born, brought streams of milk
   out of the breasts?  How grows the babe into a boy, and the boy into a
   youth, and then into a man; and, still the same, passes again into an
   old man, while no one notices the exact change from day to day?  Of the
   food, how is one part changed into blood, and another separated for
   excretion, and another part changed into flesh?  Who gives to the heart
   its unceasing motion?  Who wisely guarded the tenderness of the eyes
   with the fence of the eyelids [1111] ?  For as to the complicated and
   wonderful contrivance of the eyes, the voluminous books of the
   physicians hardly give us explanation.  Who distributes the one breath
   to the whole body?  Thou seest, O man, the Artificer, thou seest the
   wise Creator.

   16.  These points my discourse has now treated at large, having left
   out many, yea, ten thousand other things, and especially things
   incorporeal and invisible, that thou mayest abhor those who blaspheme
   the wise and good Artificer, and from what is spoken and read, and
   whatever thou canst thyself discover or conceive, from the greatness
   and beauty of the creatures mayest proportionably see the maker of them
   [1112] , and bending the knee with godly reverence to the Maker of the
   worlds, the worlds, I mean, of sense and thought, both visible and
   invisible, thou mayest with a grateful and holy tongue, with unwearied
   lips and heart, praise God and say, How wonderful are Thy works, O
   Lord; in wisdom hast Thou made them all [1113] .  For to Thee belongeth
   honour, and glory, and majesty, both now and throughout all ages.
   Amen.

   ------------------------

   Appendix to Lecture IX.

   Note.--In the manuscripts which contain this discourse under the name
   of "A Homily of S. Basil on God as Incomprehensible," some portions are
   changed to suit that subject:  but the conclusion especially is marked
   by great addition and variation, which it is well to reproduce here.
   Accordingly in place of the words in §15:  ti mempton, "What is there
   to find fault with?" and the following, the manuscripts before
   mentioned have it thus:

   "What is there to find fault with in the framing of the body?  Come
   forth into the midst and speak.  Control thine own will, and nothing
   evil shall proceed from any of thy members.  For every one of these has
   of necessity been made for our use.  Chasten thy reasoning unto piety,
   submit to God's commandments, and none of these members sin in working
   and serving in the uses for which they were made.  If thou be not
   willing, the eye sees not amiss, the ear hears nothing which it ought
   not, the hand is not stretched out for wicked greed, the foot walketh
   not towards injustice, thou hast no strange loves, committest no
   fornication, covetest not thy neighbour's wife.  Drive out wicked
   thoughts from thine heart, be as God made thee, and thou wilt rather
   give thanks to thy Creator.

   Adam at first was without clothing, faring daintily in Paradise:  and
   after he had received the commandment, but failed to keep it, and
   wickedly stretched forth his hand (not because the hand wished this,
   but because his will stretched forth his hand to that which was
   forbidden), because of his disobedience he lost also the good things he
   had received.  Thus the members are not the cause of sin to those who
   use them, but the wicked mind, as the Lord says, For out of the heart
   proceed evil thoughts, fornications, adulteries, envyings, and such
   like.  In what things thou choosest, therein thy limbs serve thee; they
   are excellently made for the service of the soul:  they are provided as
   servants to thy reason.  Guide them well by the motion of piety; bridle
   them by the fear of God; bring them into subjection to the desire of
   temperance and abstinence, and they will never rise up against thee to
   tyrannise over thee; but rather they will guard thee, and help thee
   more mightily in thy victory over the devil, while expecting also the
   incorruptible and everlasting crown of the victory.  Who openeth the
   chambers of the womb?  Who, &c."

   At the end of the same section, after the words "Wise Creator," this is
   found:  "Glorify Him in His unsearchable works, and concerning Him whom
   thou art not capable of knowing, inquire not curiously what His essence
   is.  It is better for thee to keep silence, and in faith adore,
   according to the divine Word, than daringly to search after things
   which neither thou canst reach, nor Holy Scripture hath delivered to
   thee.  These points my discourse has now treated at large, that thou
   mayest abhor those who blaspheme the wise and good Artificer, and
   rather mayest thyself also say, How wonderful are Thy works O Lord; in
   wisdom hast Thou made them all.  To Thee be the glory, and power, and
   worship, with the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and throughout all ages.
   Amen."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1058] The Septuagint, from which Cyril quotes the text, differs much
   from the Hebrew, and from the English Versions:  Who is this that
   darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?  Gird up now thy loins
   like a man:  for I will demand of thee, and answer thou Me.

   [1059] John i. 18.

   [1060] Ezekiel i. 28.

   [1061] Exod. xxxiii. 20.

   [1062] Is. lxiv. 1, Septuagint.  R.V. Oh that Thou wouldest rend the
   heavens, that Thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow
   down.

   [1063] Dan. x. 9, 16, 18.

   [1064] Wisdom xiii. 5.  Compare Theophilus of Antioch To Autolycus, I.
   5, 6:  "God cannot indeed be seen by human eyes, but is beheld and
   perceived through His providence and works....He is not visible to eyes
   of flesh, since He is incomprehensible."

   [1065] Song of the Three Children, 32.

   [1066] In Ezekiel i. 6-11, the four living creatures have each four
   wings, as also in x. 21 according to the Hebrew.  But in the latter
   passage, according to the Vatican text of the Septuagint, each has
   eight wings, as Codd. R. and Casaub. read here.  Cyril seems to have
   confused the number in Ezekiel with that in Is. vi. 2:  each one had
   six wings.  By "a wheel of four sides" Cyril explains Ez. i. 16:  a
   wheel in the midst of a wheel, as meaning two circles set at right
   angles to each other, like the equator and meridian on a globe.

   [1067] Compare Cat. iv. 4.  Irenæus (I. x. 1):  "The Church, though
   dispersed throughout the whole world, even to the ends of the earth,
   yet received from the Apostles and their disciples the Faith in One God
   the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven, and earth, and the sea and all
   that therein is."  Tertullian (de Præscriptione Hæret. cap. xiii.)
   "The rule of faith is that whereby we believe that there is One God
   only, and none other than the Creator of the world, who brought forth
   all things out of nothing through His own Word first of all sent
   forth."

   [1068] Compare Cat. vi. 13, 27.

   [1069] Gen. i. 6.

   [1070] Ps. xix. 5.

   [1071] The common reading hina me tou psuchous pleion genetai ho
   chronos, all' hina hai nuktes, k.t.l. gives a meaning contrary to the
   facts.  The translation follows the mss. Roe, Casaubon, which omit me
   and for alla read kai.  Compare Whewell's Astromony, p. 22:  "The
   length of the year is so determined as to be adapted to the
   constitution of most vegetables:  or the construction of vegetables is
   so adjusted as to be suited to the length which the year really has,
   and unsuited to a duration longer or shorter by any considerable
   portion.  The vegetable clock-work is so set as to go for a year."
   Ibid. p. 34:  "The terrestrial day, and consequently the length of the
   cycle of light and darkness, being what it is, we find various parts of
   the constitution both of animals and vegetables, which have a
   periodical character in their functions, corresponding to the diurnal
   succession of external conditions, and we find that the length of the
   period, as it exists in their constitution, coincides with the length
   of the natural day."

   [1072] Ps. xix. 2.  Compare a beautiful passage of Theophilus of
   Antioch (To Autolycus, vi.).

   [1073] Lucretius, V. 1182: "They saw the skies in constant order run,
   The varied seasons and the circling sun, Apparent rule, with unapparent
   cause, And thus they sought in gods the source of laws.

   [1074] See note 3 on Cat. iii. 33.

   [1075] Is. xlv. 7.  Compare the Homily of Chrysostom on this text.

   [1076] Whewell, Astromomy. p. 38:  "Animals also have a period in their
   functions and habits; as in the habits of waking, sleeping, eating,
   &c., and their well-being appears to depend on the coincidence of this
   period with the length of the natural day."

   [1077] Chrysostom, VI. p. 171:  "As the day brings man out to his work,
   so the night succeeding releases him from his countless toils and
   thoughts, and lulling his weary eyes to sleep, and closing their lids,
   prepares him to welcome the sunbeam again with his force in full
   vigour."

   [1078] Clement of Alexandria (Stromat. IV. 22, E. Tr.):  "And in this
   way they seem to have called the night Euphrone, since then the soul
   released from the perceptions of sense turns in on itself, and has a
   truer hold of intelligence (phronesis)."

   [1079] Chrysostom (Tom. II. p. 793):  "We usually take the reckoning of
   our money early in the morning, but of our actions, of all that we have
   said and done by day, let us demand of ourselves the account after
   supper, and even after nightfall, as we lie upon our bed, with none to
   trouble, none to disturb us.  And if we see anything done amiss, let us
   chastise our conscience, let us rebuke our mind, let us so vehemently
   impugn our account, that we may no more dare to rise up and bring
   ourselves to the same pit of sin, being mindful of the scourging at
   night."

   [1080] Clem. Alex. (Stromat. VI. 11):  "The same is true also of
   Astronomy, for being engaged in the investigation of the heavenly
   bodies, as to the form of the universe, and the revolution of the
   heaven, and the motion of the stars, it brings the soul nearer to the
   Creative Power, and teaches it to be quick in perceiving the seasons of
   the year, the changes of the atmosphere, and the risings of the stars;
   since navigation also and husbandry are full of benefit from this
   science."  Compare Lactantius (De Irâ Dei, cap. xiii.).

   [1081] Gen. i. 14.

   [1082] Job xxxviii. 28.

   [1083] Whewell, Astronomy, p. 88:  "Clouds are produced by aqueous
   vapour when it returns to the state of water."  p. 89:  "Clouds produce
   rain.  In the formation of a cloud the precipitation of moisture
   probably forms a fine watery powder, which remains suspended in the air
   in consequence of the minuteness of its particles:  but if from any
   cause the precipitation is collected in larger portions, and becomes
   drops, these descend by their weight and produce a shower."  Compare
   Aristotle, Meterologica, I. ix. 3; Ansted, Physical Geography, p. 210.

   [1084] Job xxxvii. 22:  "Out of the north cometh golden splendour"
   (R.V.).

   [1085] Job xxxviii. 37.

   [1086] Job xxxvii. 16:  "Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds?"
   In the Septuagint diakrisin nephon may mean "the separate path of the
   clouds" (Vulg. "semitas nubium,") or "the dissolving," as in Aristotle
   (Meteorol. I. vii. 10:  diakrinesthai kai dialuesthai to diatmizon
   hugron hupo tou plethous tes thermes anathumiaseos, hoste me
   sunistasthai rhadios eis hudor.  "The moist vapour is separated and
   dissolved by the great heat of the evaporation, so that it does not
   easily condense into water."  Cf. Plato, Sophistes 243 B:  diakriseis
   kai sunkriseis.

   [1087] Job xxxviii. 37 (according to the Septuagint):  "And who is he
   that numbereth the clouds by wisdom, and bent down the heaven to the
   earth?"  A.V., R.V.  "Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?"

   [1088] Job xxvi. 8:  "He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds; and
   the cloud is not rent under them."

   [1089] Ps. cxxxv. 7.

   [1090] Job xxxviii. 28.

   [1091] Ps. cxlvii. 16:  "He scattereth the hoar frost like ashes."  The
   Hebrew dvphk is rendered by pachne, "hoar frost," in Job xxxviii. 29,
   but here by omichle, "mist."

   [1092] Job xxxvii. 10:  "the breadth of the waters is straitened"
   (Marg. R.V. "congealed").  The word oiakizei in the Septuagint means to
   "steer," Lat. "gubernare" to "turn as by a helm."

   [1093] Ps. civ. 15.

   [1094] There is a similar passage on the various effects of water in
   Cat. xvi. 12.  Chrysostom (de Statuis, Hom. xii. 2), Epiphanius
   (Ancoratus, p. 69), and other Fathers, appear to reproduce both the
   thoughts and words of Cyril.

   [1095] For kausin, "burning," Morel and Milles, with Cod. Coisl., read
   kaustin, a rare word explained by Hesychius as the "growth" or
   "foliage" of the vine:  but this is fully expressed in what follows,
   and the reading kausin is confirmed by Virgil (Georg. ii. 408):
   "Primus devecta cremato sarmenta" (Reischl).

   [1096] For the construction of hina with the Indicative hiptantai, see
   Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 401.  Winer (Gram. N. T. III. sect. xli. c).

   [1097] Ps. civ. 25.

   [1098] Gr. hupostasin, literally "substance."

   [1099] Job xxxviii. 11.

   [1100] Ib. xxxix. 26.

   [1101] Gen. i. 24.

   [1102] Instead of phones (Milles), or peges (Bened. Roe, Casaub.) the
   recent Editors have restored tes ges with the Jerusalem and Munich
   mss., and Basil.

   [1103] Gr. kineseis "movements," "impulses."  Aristotle (Historia
   Animalium. IX. vii. 1) remarks that many imitations of man's mode of
   life may be observed in the habits of other animals.

   [1104] Jer. v. 8.

   [1105] Prov. vi. 6.  Instead of the epithet "laborious" (georgotatos )
   some mss. have "agile" or "restless" (gorgotatos).

   [1106] After the description of the ant, Prov. vi. 6-8, there follows
   in the Septuagint a similar reference to the bee:  "Or go to the bee,
   and learn how industrious she is, and how comely she makes her work,
   and the produce of her labours kings and commons adopt for health, and
   she is desired and esteemed by all, and though feeble in strength has
   been exalted by her regard for wisdom."  The interpolation is supposed
   to be of Greek origin, as containing "idiomatic Greek expressions which
   would not occur to a translator from the Hebrew" (Delitzsch).

   [1107] Ps. cxix. 103.

   [1108] Compare Bacon (Natural Hist. 965):  "I would have trial made of
   two other kinds of bracelets, for comforting the heart and spirits:
   one of the trochisch of vipers, made into little pieces of beads; for
   since they do great good inwards (especially for pestilent agues), it
   is like they will be effectual outwards, where they may be applied in
   greater quantity.  There would be trochisch likewise made of snakes;
   whose flesh dried is thought to have a very good opening and cordial
   virtue."  Ib. 969:  "The writers of natural magic commend the wearing
   of the spoil of a snake, for preserving of health."  Thomas Jackson (On
   the Creed, VIII. 8, § 4):  "The poisonous bitings of the scorpion are
   usually cured by the oil of scorpions."

   [1109] Shakespeare (Richard III. Act. i. Sc. ii.). Glo.  "Thine eyes,
   sweet lady, have infected mine." Anne.  "Would they were basilisks to
   strike thee dead." Compare Bacon (De Augmentis, VII. cap. ii):  "The
   fable goes of the basilisk, that if he see you first, you die for it,
   but if you see him first, he dies."  Bacon refers to Pliny (Nat. Hist.
   viii. 33).

   [1110] Job x. 11.

   [1111] Xenophon (Memor. Socratis. I. cap. iv):  "And moreover does not
   this also seem to thee like a work of providence, that, whereas the
   sight is weak, the Creator furnished it with eyelids for doors, which
   are opened whenever there is need to use the sight, but are closed in
   sleep."

   On the Clause, and in One Lord Jesus Christ, with a Reading from the
   First Epistle to the Corinthians

   For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth
   [1114] ; yet to us there is One God, the Father, of whom are all
   things, and we in Him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all
   things, and we through Him.

   1.  They who have been taught to believe "In One God the Father
   Almighty," ought also to believe in His Only-begotten Son.  For he that
   denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father [1115] .  I am the Door
   [1116] , saith Jesus; no one cometh unto the Father but through Me
   [1117] .  For if thou deny the Door, the knowledge concerning the
   Father is shut off from thee.  No man knoweth the father, save the Son,
   and he to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him [1118] .  For if thou
   deny Him who reveals, thou remainest in ignorance.  There is a sentence
   in the Gospels, saying, He that believeth not on the Son, shall not see
   life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. [1119]   For the Father hath
   indignation when the Only-begotten Son is set at nought.  For it is
   grievous to a king that merely his soldier should be dishonoured; and
   when one of his nobler officers or friends is dishonoured, then his
   anger is greatly increased:  but if any should do despite to the king's
   only-begotten son himself, who shall appease the father's indignation
   on behalf of his only-begotten son?

   2.  If, therefore, any one wishes to shew piety towards God, let him
   worship the Son, since otherwise the Father accepts not his service.
   The Father spake with a loud voice from heaven, saying, This is My
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased [1120] .  The Father was well
   pleased; unless thou also be well pleased in Him, thou hast not life.
   Be not thou carried away with the Jews when they craftily say, There is
   one God alone; but with the knowledge that God is One, know that there
   is also an Only-begotten Son of God.  I am not the first to say this,
   but the Psalmist in the person of the Son saith, The Lord said unto Me,
   Thou art My Son [1121] .  Heed not therefore what the Jews say, but
   what the Prophets say.  Dost thou wonder that they who stoned and slew
   the Prophets, set at nought the Prophets' words?

   3.  Believe thou In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of
   God.  For we say "One Lord Jesus Christ," that His Sonship may be
   "Only-begotten:"  we say "One," that thou mayest not suppose another:
   we say "One," that thou mayest not profanely diffuse the many names
   [1122] of His action among many sons.  For He is called a Door [1123] ;
   but take not the name literally for a thing of wood, but a spiritual, a
   living Door, discriminating those who enter in.  He is called a Way
   [1124] , not one trodden by feet, but leading to the Father in heaven;
   He is called a Sheep [1125] , not an irrational one, but the one which
   through its precious blood cleanses the world from its sins, which is
   led before the shearers, and knows when to be silent.  This Sheep again
   is called a Shepherd, who says, I am the Good Shepherd [1126] :  a
   Sheep because of His manhood, a Shepherd because of the loving-kindness
   of His Godhead.  And wouldst thou know that there are rational sheep?
   the Saviour says to the Apostles, Behold, I send you as sheep in the
   midst of wolves [1127] .  Again, He is called a Lion [1128] , not as a
   devourer of men, but indicating as it were by the title His kingly, and
   stedfast, and confident nature:  a Lion He is also called in opposition
   to the lion our adversary, who roars and devours those who have been
   deceived [1129] .  For the Saviour came, not as having changed the
   gentleness of His own nature, but as the strong Lion of the tribe of
   Judah [1130] , saving them that believe, but treading down the
   adversary.  He is called a Stone, not a lifeless stone, cut out by
   men's hands, but a chief corner-stone [1131] , on whom whosoever
   believeth shall not be put to shame.

   4.  He is called Christ, not as having been anointed by men's hands,
   but eternally anointed by the Father to His High-Priesthood on behalf
   of men [1132] .  He is called Dead, not as having abode among the dead,
   as all in Hades, but as being alone free among the dead [1133] .  He is
   called Son of Man, not as having had His generation from earth, as each
   of us, but as coming upon the clouds To Judge Both Quick and Dead
   [1134] .  He is called Lord, not improperly as those who are so called
   among men, but as having a natural and eternal Lordship [1135] .  He is
   called Jesus by a fitting name, as having the appellation from His
   salutary healing.  He is called Son, not as advanced by adoption, but
   as naturally begotten.  And many are the titles of our Saviour; lest,
   therefore, His manifold appellations should make thee think of many
   sons, and because of the errors of the heretics, who say that Christ is
   one, and Jesus another, and the Door another, and so on [1136] , the
   Faith secures thee beforehand, saying well, In One Lord Jesus Christ:
   for though the titles are many, yet their subject is one.

   5.  But the Saviour comes in various forms to each man for his profit
   [1137] .  For to those who have need of gladness He becomes a Vine; and
   to those who want to enter in He stands as a Door; and to those who
   need to offer up their prayers He stands a mediating High Priest.
   Again, to those who have sins He becomes a Sheep, that He may be
   sacrificed for them.  He is made all things to all men [1138] ,
   remaining in His own nature what He is.  For so remaining, and holding
   the dignity of His Sonship in reality unchangeable, He adapts Himself
   to our infirmities, just as some excellent physician or compassionate
   teacher; though He is Very Lord, and received not the Lordship by
   advancement [1139] , but has the dignity of His Lordship from nature,
   and is not called Lord improperly [1140] , as we are, but is so in
   verity, since by the Father's bidding [1141] He is Lord of His own
   works.  For our lordship is over men of equal rights and like passions,
   nay often over our elders, and often a young master rules over aged
   servants.  But in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lordship is not
   so:  but He is first Maker, then Lord [1142] :  first He made all
   things by the Father's will, then, He is Lord of the things which were
   made by Him.

   6.  Christ the Lord is He who was born in the city of David [1143] .
   And wouldest thou know that Christ is Lord with the Father even before
   His Incarnation [1144] , that thou mayest not only accept the statement
   by faith, but mayest also receive proof from the Old Testament?  Go to
   the first book, Genesis:  God saith, Let us make man, not in My image,'
   but, in Our image [1145] .  And after Adam was made, the sacred writer
   says, And God created man; in the image of God created He him [1146] .
   For he did not limit the dignity of the Godhead to the Father alone,
   but included the Son also:  that it might be shewn that man is not only
   the work of God, but also of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is Himself also
   Very God.  This Lord, who works together with the Father, wrought with
   Him also in the case of Sodom, according to the Scripture:  And the
   Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the Lord
   out of heaven [1147] .  This Lord is He who afterwards was seen of
   Moses, as much as he was able to see.  For the Lord is loving unto man,
   ever condescending to our infirmities.

   7.  Moreover, that you may be sure that this is He who was seen of
   Moses, hear Paul's testimony, when he says, For they all drank of a
   spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock was Christ [1148] .
   And again:  By faith Moses forsook Egypt [1149] , and shortly after he
   says, accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
   treasures in Egypt [1150] .  This Moses says to Him, Shew me Thyself.
   Thou seest that the Prophets also in those times saw the Christ, that
   is, as far as each was able.  Shew me Thyself, that I may see Thee with
   understanding [1151] .  But He saith, There shall no man see My face,
   and live [1152] .  For this reason then, because no man could see the
   face of the Godhead and live, He took on Him the face of human nature,
   that we might see this and live.  And yet when He wished to shew even
   that with a little majesty, when His face did shine as the sun [1153] ,
   the disciples fell down affrighted.  If then His bodily countenance,
   shining not in the full power of Him that wrought, but according to the
   capacity of the Disciples, affrighted them, so that even thus they
   could not bear it, how could any man gaze upon the majesty of the
   Godhead?  A great thing,' saith the Lord, thou desirest, O Moses:  and
   I approve thine insatiable desire, and I will do this thing [1154] for
   thee, but according as thou art able.  Behold, I will put thee in the
   clift of the rock [1155] :  for as being little, thou shalt lodge in a
   little space.'

   8.  Now here I wish you to make safe what I am going to say, because of
   the Jews.  For our object is to prove that the Lord Jesus Christ was
   with the Father.  The Lord then says to Moses, I will pass by before
   thee with My glory, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee
   [1156] .  Being Himself the Lord, what Lord doth He proclaim?  Thou
   seest how He was covertly teaching the godly doctrine of the Father and
   the Son.  And again, in what follows it is written word for word:  And
   the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and
   proclaimed the name of the Lord.  And the Lord passed by before him,
   and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
   long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, both keeping
   righteousness and shewing mercy unto thousands, taking away iniquities,
   and transgressions, and sins [1157] .  Then in what follows, Moses
   bowed his head and worshipped [1158] before the Lord who proclaimed the
   Father, and said:  Go Thou then, O Lord, in the midst of us [1159] .

   9.  This is the first proof:  receive now a second plain one.  The Lord
   said unto my Lord, sit Thou on My right hand [1160] .  The Lord says
   this to the Lord, not to a servant, but to the Lord of all, and His own
   Son, to whom He put all things in subjection.  But when He saith that
   all things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted, which
   did put all things under Him, and what follows; that God may be all in
   all [1161] .  The Only-begotten Son is Lord of all, but the obedient
   Son of the Father, for He grasped not the Lordship [1162] , but
   received it by nature of the Father's own will.  For neither did the
   Son grasp it, nor the Father grudge to impart it.  He it is who saith,
   All things are delivered unto Me of My Father [1163] ; "delivered unto
   Me, not as though I had them not before; and I keep them well, not
   robbing Him who hath given them."

   10.  The Son of God then is Lord:  He is Lord, who was born in
   Bethlehem of Judæa, according to the Angel who said to the shepherds, I
   bring you good tidings of great joy, that unto you is born this day in
   the city of David Christ the Lord [1164] :  of whom an Apostle says
   elsewhere, The word which God sent unto the children of Israel,
   preaching the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ:  He is Lord of all
   [1165] .  But when he says, of all, do thou except nothing from His
   Lordship:  for whether Angels, or Archangels, or principalities, or
   powers, or any created thing named by the Apostles, all are under the
   Lordship of the Son.  Of Angels He is Lord, as thou hast it in the
   Gospels, Then the Devil departed from Him, and the Angels came and
   ministered unto Him [1166] ; for the Scripture saith not, they
   succoured Him, but they ministered unto Him, that is, like servants.
   When He was about to be born of a Virgin, Gabriel was then His servant,
   having received His service as a peculiar dignity.  When He was about
   to go into Egypt, that He might overthrow the gods of Egypt made with
   hands [1167] , again an Angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream [1168] .
   After He had been crucified, and had risen again, an Angel brought the
   good tidings, and as a trustworthy servant said to the women, Go, tell
   His disciples that He is risen, and goeth before you into Galilee; lo,
   I have told you [1169] :  almost as if he had said, "I have not
   neglected my command, I protest that I have told you; that if ye
   disregard it, the blame may not be on me, but on those who disregard
   it."  This then is the One Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the lesson just
   now read speaks:  For though there be many that are called gods,
   whether in heaven or in earth, and so on, yet to us there is One God,
   the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord, Jesus
   Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him [1170] .

   11.  And He is called by two names, Jesus Christ; Jesus, because He
   saves,--Christ, because He is a Priest [1171] .  And knowing this the
   inspired Prophet Moses conferred these two titles on two men
   distinguished above all [1172] :  his own successor in the government,
   Auses [1173] , he renamed Jesus; and his own brother Aaron he surnamed
   Christ [1174] , that by two well-approved men he might represent at
   once both the High Priesthood, and the Kingship of the One Jesus Christ
   who was to come.  For Christ is a High Priest like Aaron; since He
   glorified not Himself to be made a High Priest, but He that spake unto
   Him, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek [1175]
   .  And Jesus the son of Nave was in many things a type of Him.  For
   when he began to rule over the people, he began from Jordan [1176] ,
   whence Christ also, after He was baptized, began to preach the gospel.
   And the son of Nave appoints twelve to divide the inheritance [1177] ;
   and twelve Apostles Jesus sends forth, as heralds of the truth, into
   all the world.  The typical Jesus saved Rahab the harlot when she
   believed:  and the true Jesus says, Behold, the publicans and the
   harlots go before you into the kingdom of God [1178] .  With only a
   shout the walls of Jericho fell down in the time of the type:  and
   because Jesus said, There shall not be left here one stone upon another
   [1179] , the Temple of the Jews opposite to us is fallen, the cause of
   its fall not being the denunciation but the sin of the transgressors.

   12.  There is One Lord Jesus Christ, a wondrous name, indirectly
   announced beforehand by the Prophets.  For Esaias the Prophet says,
   Behold, thy Saviour cometh, having His own reward [1180] .  Now Jesus
   in Hebrew is by interpretation Saviour.  For the Prophetic gift,
   foreseeing the murderous spirit of the Jews against their Lord [1181] ,
   veiled His name, lest from knowing it plainly beforehand they might
   plot against Him readily.  But He was openly called Jesus not by men,
   but by an Angel, who came not by his own authority, but was sent by the
   power of God, and said to Joseph, Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
   wife; for that which is conceivedin her is of the Holy Ghost.  And she
   shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus [1182] .
   And immediately he renders the reason of this name, saying, for He
   shall save His people from their sins.  Consider how He who was not yet
   born could have a people, unless He was in being before He was born
   [1183] .  This also the Prophet says in His person, From the bowels of
   my mother hath He made mention of My name [1184] ; because the Angel
   foretold that He should be called Jesus.  And again concerning Herod's
   plot again he says, And under the shadow of His hand hath He hid Me
   [1185] .

   13.  Jesus then means according to the Hebrew "Saviour," but in the
   Greek tongue "The Healer;" since He is physician of souls and bodies,
   curer of spirits, curing the blind in body [1186] , and leading minds
   into light, healing the visibly lame, and guiding sinners' steps to
   repentance, saying to the palsied, Sin no more, and, Take up thy bed
   and walk [1187] .  For since the body was palsied for the sin of the
   soul, He ministered first to the soul that He might extend the healing
   to the body.  If, therefore, any one is suffering in soul from sins,
   there is the Physician for him:  and if any one here is of little
   faith, let him say to Him, Help Thou mine unbelief [1188] .  If any is
   encompassed also with bodily ailments, let him not be faithless, but
   let him draw nigh; for to such diseases also Jesus ministers [1189] ,
   and let him learn that Jesus is the Christ.

   14.  For that He is Jesus the Jews allow, but not further that He is
   Christ.  Therefore saith the Apostle, Who is the liar, but he that
   denieth that Jesus is the Christ [1190] ?  But Christ is a High Priest,
   whose priesthood passes not to another [1191] , neither having begun
   His Priesthood in time [1192] , nor having any successor in His
   High-Priesthood:  as thou heardest on the Lord's day, when we were
   discoursing in the congregation [1193] on the phrase, After the Order
   of Melchizedek.  He received not the High-Priesthood from bodily
   succession, nor was He anointed with oil prepared by man [1194] , but
   before all ages by the Father; and He so far excels the others as with
   an oath He is made Priest:  For they are priests without an oath, but
   He with an oath by Him that said, The Lord sware, and will not repent
   [1195] .  The mere purpose of the Father was sufficient for surety:
   but the mode of assurance is twofold, namely that with the purpose
   there follows the oath also, that by two immutable things, in which it
   was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong encouragement
   [1196] for our faith, who receive Christ Jesus as the Son of God.

   15.  This Christ, when He was come, the Jews denied, but the devils
   confessed.  But His forefather David was not ignorant of Him, when he
   said, I have ordained a lamp for mine Anointed [1197] :  which lamp
   some have interpreted to be the brightness of Prophecy [1198] , others
   the flesh which He took upon Him from the Virgin, according to the
   Apostle's word, But we have this treasure in earthen vessels [1199] .
   The Prophet was not ignorant of Him, when He said, and announceth unto
   men His Christ [1200] .  Moses also knew Him, Isaiah knew Him, and
   Jeremiah; not one of the Prophets was ignorant of Him.  Even devils
   recognised Him, for He rebuked them, and the Scripture says, because
   they knew that He was Christ [1201] .  The Chief-priests knew Him not,
   and the devils confessed Him:  the Chief Priests knew Him not, and a
   woman of Samaria proclaimed Him, saying, Come, see a man which told me
   all things that ever I did.  Is not this the Christ [1202] ?

   16.  This is Jesus Christ who came a High-Priest of the good things to
   come [1203] ; who for the bountifulness of His Godhead imparted His own
   title to us all.  For kings among men have their royal style which
   others may not share:  but Jesus Christ being the Son of God gave us
   the dignity of being called Christians.  But some one will say, The
   name of "Christians" is new, and was not in use aforetime [1204] :  and
   new-fashioned phrases are often objected to on the score of strangeness
   [1205] .  The prophet made this point safe beforehand, saying, But upon
   My servants shall a new name be called, which shall be blessed upon the
   earth [1206] .  Let us question the Jews:  Are ye servants of the Lord,
   or not?  Shew then your new name.  For ye were called Jews and
   Israelites in the time of Moses, and the other prophets, and after the
   return from Babylon, and up to the present time:  where then is your
   new name?  But we, since we are servants of the Lord, have that new
   name:  new indeed, but the new name, which shall be blessed upon the
   earth.  This name caught the world in its grasp:  for Jews are only in
   a certain region, but Christians reach to the ends of the world:  for
   it is the name of the Only-begotten Son of God that is proclaimed.

   17.  But wouldest thou know that the Apostles knew and preached the
   name of Christ, or rather had Christ Himself within them?  Paul says to
   his hearers, Or seek ye a proof of Christ that speaketh in me [1207] ?
   Paul proclaims Christ, saying, For we preach not ourselves, but Christ
   Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake [1208] .
   Who then is this?  The former persecutor.  O mighty wonder!  The former
   persecutor himself preaches Christ.  But wherefore?  Was he bribed?
   Nay there was none to use this mode of persuasion.  But was it that he
   saw Him present on earth, and was abashed?  He had already been taken
   up into heaven.  He went forth to persecute, and after three days the
   persecutor is a preacher in Damascus.  By what power?  Others call
   friends as witnesses for friends but I have presented to you as a
   witness the former enemy:  and dost thou still doubt?  The testimony of
   Peter and John, though weighty, was yet of a kind open to suspicion:
   for they were His friends.  But of one who was formerly his enemy, and
   afterwards dies for His sake, who can any longer doubt the truth?

   18.  At this point of my discourse I am truly filled with wonder at the
   wise dispensation of the Holy Spirit; how He confined the Epistles of
   the rest to a small number, but to Paul the former persecutor gave the
   privilege of writing fourteen.  For it was not because Peter or John
   was less that He restrained the gift; God forbid!  But in order that
   the doctrine might be beyond question, He granted to the former enemy
   and persecutor the privilege of writing more, in order that we all
   might thus be made believers.  For all were amazed at Paul, and said,
   Is not this he that was formerly a persecutor [1209] ?  Did he not come
   hither, that he might lead us away bound to Jerusalem?  Be not amazed,
   said Paul, I know that it is hard for me to kick against the pricks:  I
   know that I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted
   the Church of God [1210] ; but I did it in ignorance [1211] :  for I
   thought that the preaching of Christ was destruction of the Law, and
   knew not that He came Himself to fulfil the Law and not to destroy it
   [1212] .  But the grace of God was exceeding abundant in me [1213] .

   19.  Many, my beloved, are the true testimonies concerning Christ.  The
   Father bears witness from heaven of His Son:  the Holy Ghost bears
   witness, descending bodily in likeness of a dove:  the Archangel
   Gabriel bears witness, bringing good tidings to Mary:  the Virgin
   Mother of God [1214] bears witness:  the blessed place of the manger
   bears witness.  Egypt bears witness, which received the Lord while yet
   young in the body [1215] :  Symeon bears witness, who received Him in
   his arms, and said, Now, Lord, lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
   peace, according to Thy word; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,
   which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people [1216] .  Anna
   also, the prophetess, a most devout widow, of austere life, bears
   witness of Him.  John the Baptist bears witness, the greatest among the
   Prophets, and leader of the New Covenant, who in a manner united both
   Covenants in Himself, the Old and the New.  Jordan is His witness among
   rivers; the sea of Tiberias among seas:  blind and lame bear witness,
   and dead men raised to life, and devils saying, What have we to do with
   Thee, Jesus? we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy One of God [1217] .
   Winds bear witness, silenced at His bidding:  five loaves multiplied
   into five thousand bear Him witness.  The holy wood of the Cross bears
   witness, seen among us to this day, and from this place now almost
   filling the whole world, by means of those who in faith take portions
   from it [1218] .  The palm-tree [1219] on the ravine bears witness,
   having supplied the palm-branches to the children who then hailed Him.
   Gethsemane [1220] bears witness, still to the thoughtful almost shewing
   Judas.  Golgotha [1221] , the holy hill standing above us here, bears
   witness to our sight:  the Holy Sepulchre bears witness, and the stone
   which lies there [1222] to this day.  The sun now shining is His
   witness, which then at the time of His saving Passion was eclipsed
   [1223] :  the darkness is His witness, which was then from the sixth
   hour to the ninth:  the light bears witness, which shone forth from the
   ninth hour until evening.  The Mount of Olives bears witness, that holy
   mount from which He ascended to the Father:  the rain-bearing clouds
   are His witnesses, having received their Lord:  yea, and the gates of
   heaven bear witness [having received their Lord [1224] ], concerning
   which the Psalmist said, Lift up your doors, O ye Princes, and be ye
   lift up ye everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come in
   [1225] .  His former enemies bear witness, of whom the blessed Paul is
   one, having been a little while His enemy, but for a long time His
   servant:  the Twelve Apostles are His witnesses, having preached the
   truth not only in words, but also by their own torments and deaths:
   the shadow of Peter [1226] bears witness, having healed the sick in the
   name of Christ.  The handkerchiefs and aprons bear witness, as in like
   manner by Christ's power they wrought cures of old through Paul [1227]
   .  Persians [1228] and Goths [1229] , and all the Gentile converts bear
   witness, by dying for His sake, whom they never saw with eyes of
   flesh:  the devils, who to this day [1230] are driven out by the
   faithful, bear witness to Him.

   20.  So many and diverse, yea and more than these, are His witnesses:
   is then the Christ thus witnessed any longer disbelieved?  Nay rather
   if there is any one who formerly believed not, let him now believe:
   and if any was before a believer, let him receive a greater increase of
   faith, by believing in our Lord Jesus Christ, and let him understand
   whose name he bears.  Thou art called a Christian:  be tender of the
   name; let not our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, be blasphemed
   through thee:  but rather let your good works shine before men [1231]
   that they who see them may in Christ Jesus our Lord glorify the Father
   which is in heaven:   To whom be the glory, both now and for ever and
   ever.  Amen.

   [1132] The reading of the earlier Editions huper anthropon is free from
   all difficulty, and so the more likely to have been substituted for
   what is at first sight more difficult huper anthropon, the reading of
   Cod. Coislin. adopted by the Benedictine and subsequent Editors.  The
   idea of a super-human Priesthood to which the Son in His Divine nature
   was anointed by the Father from eternity is repeated by Cyril in § 14
   of this Lecture, and in Cat. xi. 1, 14.  See Index, "Priesthood," and
   the reference there given to a fuller consideration of the subject in
   the Introduction.

   [1133] Ps. lxxxviii. 5.

   [1134] John v. 27.  Comparing what Cyril says here with Cat. iv. 15,
   and xv. 10, we see that he means to explain why Christ is called the
   "Son of Man" when "He cometh again from heaven," and "no more from
   earth."  The preceding clause refers to His first coming in the flesh,
   as differing in the manner of His conception and birth from other men.

   [1135] Cf. Athanas. (c. Arian. II. xv. 14), "That very Word who was by
   nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by means of a servant's form
   been made Lord of all and Christ."

   [1136] Cf. Irenæus (III. xvi. 8):  "All therefore are outside the
   Dispensation, who under pretence of knowledge understand that Jesus was
   one, and Christ another, and the Only-begotten another (from whom again
   is the Word), and the Saviour another."  The Cerinthians, Ebionites,
   Ophites, and Valentinians are mentioned by Irenæus as thus separating
   the Christ from Jesus.

   [1137] Cf. Athanas. (Epist. X.):  "Since He is rich and manifold, He
   varies Himself according to the individual capacity of each soul."

   [1138] 1 Cor. ix. 22.

   [1139] ek prokopes.  We learn from Athanasius (c. Arian. i. 37, 38,
   40), that from St. Paul's language Philipp. ii. 9:  "Wherefore also God
   highly exalted Him, &c.," and from Ps. xlv. 7:  "Thou hast loved
   righteousness and hated iniquity:  therefore God, thy God, hath
   anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows," the Arians
   argued that Christ first received Divine honour as Son and Lord as the
   reward of His obedience as Man.  Athanasius replies (c. 40):  "He was
   not from a lower state promoted; but rather, existing as God, He took
   the form of a servant, and in taking it was not promoted but humbled
   Himself.  Where then is there here any reward of virtue, or what
   advancement (prokope) and promotion in humiliation?" The same doctrine
   had been previously held by the disciples of Paul of Samosata, who said
   that Christ was not originally God, but after His Incarnation was by
   advance (ek prokopes) made God, from being made by nature a mere man:
   see Athanas. (de Decretis, § 24, c. Arian. i. 38).  S. Cyril refers to
   the error and uses the same word, in xi. 1, 7, 13, 15, 17, and xiv. 27.

   [1140] katachrestikos, i.e. in a secondary or metaphorical sense.  Cf.
   vii. 5.

   [1141] neumati, "command" or "bidding," as expressed by nodding the
   head.

   [1142] Origen (De Principiis, I. ii. 10) had argued that "even God
   cannot be called omnipotent, unless there exist those over whom He may
   exercise His power," and therefore creation must have been eternal, or
   God could not have been eternally Omnipotent.  In other passages Origen
   declares it an impiety to hold that matter is co-eternal with God (De
   Princip. II. i. 4), and yet maintains that there were other worlds
   before this, and that there was never a time when there was no world
   existing. Methodius, in a fragment of his work On things Created,
   preserved by Photius, and quoted by Bishop Bull (Def. Fid. Nic. II.
   xiii. 9), argues against these theories of Origen, that in John i. 2
   the words "The same was in the beginning with God" indicate the
   authority (to exousiastikon) of the Word which He had with the Father
   before the world came into existence; since from all eternity God the
   Father, together with His Word, possessed the Almighty power whereby
   whenever He would He could create worlds to rule over. Dean Church
   remarks that "On the other hand Tertullian, contra Hermog. 3,
   considering the attributes in question to belong not to the Divine
   Nature, but Office, denies that God was Almighty (Lord?) from eternity;
   while the Greeks affirmed this (vid. Cyril Alex. in Joann. xvii. 8, p.
   963; Athan. Orat. ii. 12-14), as understanding by the term the inherent
   but latent attribute of doing what He had not yet done, to
   exousiastikon." Cleopas, the Jerusalem Editor, regards the passage as
   directed against Paul of Samosata, who asserted that Christ had become
   God, and received His kingdom and Lordship only after His Incarnation,
   and remarks:--"S. Cyril evidently regards the Lordship of Jesus Christ
   as twofold:  one that which from eternity belonged to Him as God, which
   he calls natural, according to which He was ever both Lord and King, as
   being by nature God' (Cyril Alex. in Johann. cap. xvii.); and the other
   the Lordship in time relative to the creatures, by which He exercises
   dominion over the works created by Him, as being their Maker."

   [1143] Luke ii. 11.

   [1144] Among those who denied the Divine præ-existence of Christ
   Cleopas enumerates Ebion, Carpocrates, Theodotus, Artemon, Paul of
   Samosata, Marcellus, and Photinus.

   [1150] Heb. xi. 26.  Quoting from memory Cyril mistakes the order of
   the two sentences.

   [1151] Ex. xxxiii. 13.  Cyril means that even before His Incarnation
   Christ was seen as far as was possible by Prophets such as Moses.  This
   view was held by many of the Fathers before Cyril.  See Justin M.
   (Tryph. § 56 ff.); Tertull. (adv. Praxean, § 16); Euseb. (Demonstr.
   Evang. V. 13-16).

   (Jehovah):"  compare Gen. iv. 26.

   [1157] Ex. xxxiv. 5-7.  For "keeping righteousness and shewing mercy,"
   the Hebrew has only "keeping mercy."

   [1158] Ex. xxxiv. 8.

   [1159] Ib. xxxiv. 9.

   [1160] Ps. cx. 1.  Heb. "An oracle of Jehovah unto my lord."  Cyril's
   argument is based upon the common mistake of supposing that Kurios
   represents the same Hebrew word in both parts of the sentence.

   [1161] 1 Cor. xv. 27, 28.

   [1162] Cyril evidently alludes to Philip. ii. 6, "Who being in the form
   of God thought it not a prize to be on an equality with God:"  for the
   right interpretation of which passage, see Dean Gwynn's notes in the
   Speaker's Commentary.

   [1163] Matt. xi. 27; Luke x. 22.  On this text Athanasius wrote a
   special treatise (In illud Omnia,' &c.), against the arguments of
   Arius, Eusebius, and their fellows, who said,--"If all things were
   delivered (meaning by all' the Lordship of Creation), there was once a
   time when He had them not.  But it He had them not, He is not of the
   Father, for if He were, He would on that account have had them always."
   Again (contr. Arian. Orat. III. cap. xxvii. § 36), Athanasius argues:
   "Lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from
   the exact likeness and identity of what He hath, should wander into the
   impiety of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He
   has said, Was given unto Me, and I received, and Were delivered to Me,
   only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father's Word, and the
   Eternal Son, who, because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally
   what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father
   what eternally He hath."

   cometh unto Egypt:  and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His
   presence."  The prophecy was supposed by many of the Fathers to have
   been fulfilled by the flight into Egypt.  Cf. Athanas. (Ep. LXI. ad
   Maximum, § 4):  "As a child He came down to Egypt, and brought to
   nought its idols made with hands:"  and (de Incarn. § 36):  "Which of
   the righteous men or kings went down into Egypt, so that at his coming
   the idols of Egypt fell?"  On the passage of Isaiah see Delitzsch, and

   The change may have been caused by the occurrence of enkriton just

   [1173] Eusebius (u.s):  "His successor, therefore, who had not hitherto
   borne the name Jesus, but had been called by another name, Auses, which
   had been given him by his parents, he now called Jesus, bestowing the
   name upon him as a gift of honour far greater than any kingly diadem."
   Auses is a common corruption of the name Oshea.  See the note on the
   passage of Eusebius in this series.

   [1174] Eusebius:  "He consecrated a man high-priest of God, in so far

   only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also
   always present; and not merely while the Saviour was on earth, but also
   after His death they were alive for a long while, so that some of them

   not easy to fix the invention of this word, which La Croze
   (Christianisme des Indes, tom. i. p. 16) ascribes to Eusebius of
   Cæsarea and the Arians.  The orthodox testimonies are produced by Cyril
   (of Alexandria) and Petavius (Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. L. v. cap. 15,
   p. 254, &c.), but the veracity of the Saint is questionable, and the
   epithet of theotokos so easily slides from the margin to the text of a
   Catholic ms."  This passage is justly described as "Gibbon's calumny"
   by Dr. Newman:  see his notes on the title theotokos (Athan. c. Arian.
   Or. ii. cap. 12, n.; Or. iii. capp. 14, 29, 33).  The word is certainly
   used by Origen (Deut. xxii. 13, Lommatzch. Tom. x. p. 378):  "She that
   is already betrothed is called a wife, as also in the case of Joseph
   and the Theotokos."  Cf. Archelaus (Disput. cum Mane, cap. xxxiv. "qui
   de Maria Dei Genetrice natus est"); Eusebius (de Vita Constantini, III.
   cap. 43:  "The pious Empress adorned with rare memorials the place of
   the travail of the Theotokos").  For other examples see Suicer's

   proclaimed by the Apostles, it may in their day also be honoured as
   having been first to welcome Him'" (Cleopas).

   [1219] The Bordeaux Pilgrim, who visited the Holy Places of Jerusalem,
   a.d. 333, c. speaks of this palm-tree as still existing.  The longevity
   of the palm was proverbial:  cf. Aristot. (De Longitudine Vitæ, c. iv.
   2).

   [1220] The same Pilgrim (as quoted by the Benedictine Editor) says,
   "There is also the rock where Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ."  Compare

   [1223] See Cat. ii. 15, note 8, and xiii. 25, 34, 38.  On the
   supernatural character of the darkness mentioned in the Gospels see
   Meyer, Commentary, Matt. xxvii. 45.  An eclipse of the sun was of
   course impossible, as the moon was full.  Mr. J. R. Hind (Historical
   Eclipses, "Times," 19th July, 1872) states that the solar eclipse,
   mentioned by Phlegon the freedman of Hadrian, which occurred on Nov.
   24, a.d. 29, and was partial at Jerusalem, is "the only solar eclipse
   that could have been visible at Jerusalem during the period usually
   fixed for the ministry of Christ."  He adds, "The Moon was eclipsed on
   the generally received date of the Crucifixion, 3 April, a.d. 33.  I
   find she had emerged from the earth's dark shadow a quarter of an hour
   before she rose at Jerusalem (6:36 p.m.), but the penumbra continued
   upon her disc for an hour afterwards."  Thus the "darkness from the
   sixth hour unto the ninth" cannot be explained as the natural effect of
   an eclipse either solar or lunar.

   [1224] This clause is omitted in Codd. Mon. 1, 2, Roe, Casaub., and is
   probably repeated from the preceding line:  such repetitions, however,
   are not uncommon in Cyril's style.

   whom Cyril quotes.

   [1228] The persecution of the Christians in Persia by Sapor II. is
   described at length by Sozomen (E.H. II. cc. ix.-xv., in this Series).
   It commenced in a.d. 343, and was going on at the date of these
   Lectures and long after.  "During fifty years the Cross lay prostrate
   in blood and ashes" (Dict. Bib. Sassanidæ').  Compare Neander, Church
   History, Tom. III. p 148, Bohn.)

   [1229] The Goths here mentioned are the Gothi minores dwelling on the
   north of the Danube, where Ulfilas, "the Apostle of the Goths"
   (311-381), converted many of his countrymen to Christianity.  After
   suffering severe persecution, he was allowed by the Constantius to take
   refuge with his Arian converts in Moesia and Thrace.  This migration
   took place in 348 a.d., the same year in which Cyril's Lectures were
   delivered.

   Lecture XI.

   On the Words, the Only-Begotten Son of God, Begotten of the Father Very
   God Before All Ages, by Whom All Things Were Made.

   Hebrews i. 1

   God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto
   the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by
   His Son.

   1.  That we have hope in Jesus Christ has been sufficiently shewn,
   according to our ability, in what we delivered to you yesterday.  But
   we must not simply believe in Christ Jesus nor receive Him as one of
   the many who are improperly called Christs [1232] .  For they were
   figurative Christs, but He is the true Christ; not having risen by
   advancement [1233] from among men to the Priesthood, but ever having
   the dignity of the Priesthood from the Father [1234] .  And for this
   cause the Faith guarding us beforehand lest we should suppose Him to be
   one of the ordinary Christs, adds to the profession of the Faith, that
   we believe In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God.

   2.  And again on hearing of a "Son," think not of an adopted son but a
   Son by nature [1235] , an Only-begotten Son, having no brother.  For
   this is the reason why He is called "Only-begotten," because in the
   dignity of the Godhead, and His generation from the Father, He has no
   brother.  But we call Him the Son of God, not of ourselves, but because
   the Father Himself named Christ [1236] His Son [1237] :  and a true
   name is that which is set by fathers upon their children [1238] .

   3.  Our Lord Jesus Christ erewhile became Man, but by the many He was
   unknown.  Wishing, therefore, to teach that which was not known, He
   called together His disciples, and asked them, Whom do men say that I,
   the Son of Man, am [1239] ? --not from vain-glory, but wishing to shew
   them the truth, lest dwelling with God, the Only-begotten of God [1240]
   , they should think lightly of Him as if He were some mere man.  And
   when they answered that some said Elias, and some Jeremias, He said to
   them, They may be excused for not knowing, but ye, My Apostles, who in
   My name cleanse lepers, and cast out devils, and raise the dead, ought
   not to be ignorant of Him, through whom ye do these wondrous works.
   And when they all became silent (for the matter was too high for man to
   learn), Peter, the foremost of the Apostles and chief herald [1241] of
   the Church, neither aided by cunning invention, nor persuaded by human
   reasoning, but enlightened in his mind from the Father, says to Him,
   Thou art the Christ, not only so, but the Son of the living God.  And
   there follows a blessing upon his speech (for in truth it was above
   man), and as a seal upon what he had said, that it was the Father who
   had revealed it to him.  For the Saviour says, Blessed art thou, Simon
   Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but My
   Father which is in heaven [1242] .  He therefore who acknowledges our
   Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, partakes of this blessedness; but he
   who denies the Son of God is a poor and miserable man.

   4.  Again, I say, on hearing of a Son, understand it not merely in an
   improper sense, but as a Son in truth, a Son by nature, without
   beginning [1243] ; not as having come out of bondage into a higher
   state of adoption [1244] , but a Son eternally begotten by an
   inscrutable and incomprehensible generation.  And in like manner on
   hearing of the First-born [1245] , think not that this is after the
   manner of men; for the first-born among men have other brothers also.
   And it is somewhere written, Israel is My son, My first-born [1246] .
   But Israel is, as Reuben was, a first-born son rejected:  for Reuben
   went up to his father's couch; and Israel cast his Father's Son out of
   the vineyard, and crucified Him.

   To others also the Scripture says, Ye are the sons of the Lord your God
   [1247] :  and in another place, I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are
   all sons of the Most High [1248] .  I have said, not, "I have
   begotten."  They, when God so said, received the sonship, which before
   they had not:  but He was not begotten to be other than He was before;
   but was begotten from the beginning Son of the Father, being above all
   beginning and all ages, Son of the Father, in all things like [1249] to
   Him who begat Him, eternal of a Father eternal, Life of Life begotten,
   and Light of Light, and Truth of Truth, and Wisdom of the Wise, and
   King of King, and God of God, and Power of Power [1250] .

   5.  If then thou hear the Gospel saying, The book of the generation of
   Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham [1251] , understand
   "according to the flesh."  For He is the Son of David at the end of the
   ages [1252] , but the Son of God Before All Ages, without beginning
   [1253] .  The one, which before He had not, He received; but the other,
   which He hath, He hath eternally as begotten of the Father.  Two
   fathers He hath:  one, David, according to the flesh, and one, God, His
   Father in a Divine manner [1254] .  As the Son of David, He is subject
   to time, and to handling, and to genealogical descent:  but as Son
   according to the Godhead [1255] , He is subject neither to time nor to
   place, nor to genealogical descent:  for His generation who shall
   declare [1256] ?  God is a Spirit [1257] ; He who is a Spirit hath
   spiritually begotten, as being incorporeal, an inscrutable and
   incomprehensible generation.  The Son Himself says of the Father, The
   Lord said unto Me, Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten Thee [1258]
   .  Now this to-day is not recent, but eternal:  a timeless to-day,
   before all ages.  From the womb, before the morning star, have I
   begotten Thee [1259] .

   6.  Believe thou therefore on Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, and
   a Son Only-Begotten, according to the Gospel which says, For God so
   loved the world, that He gave His Only-begotten Son, that whosoever
   believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life [1260] .
   And again,He that believeth on the Son is not judged, but hath passed
   out of death into life [1261] .  But he that believeth not the Son
   shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him [1262] .  And
   John testified concerning Him, saying, And we beheld His glory, glory
   as of the only-begotten from the father,--full of grace and truth
   [1263] :  at whom the devils trembled and said, Ah! what have we to do
   with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of the living God [1264] .

   7.  He is then the Son of God by nature and not by adoption [1265] ,
   begotten of the Father.  And he that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him
   also that is begotten of Him [1266] ; but he that despiseth Him that is
   begotten casts back the insult upon Him who begat.  And whenever thou
   hear of God begetting, sink not down in thought to bodily things, nor
   think of a corruptible generation, lest thou be guilty of impiety.  God
   is a Spirit [1267] , His generation is spiritual:  for bodies beget
   bodies, and for the generation of bodies time needs must intervene; but
   time intervenes not in the generation of the Son from the Father.  And
   in our case what is begotten is begotten imperfect:  but the Son of God
   was begotten perfect; for what He is now, that is He also from the
   beginning [1268] , begotten without beginning.  We are begotten so as
   to pass from infantile ignorance to a state of reason:  thy generation,
   O man, is imperfect, for thy growth is progressive.  But think not that
   it is thus in His case, nor impute infirmity to Him who hath begotten.
   For if that which He begot was imperfect, and acquired its perfection
   in time, thou art imputing infirmity to Him who hath begotten; if so
   be, the Father did not bestow from the beginning that which, as thou
   sayest, time bestowed afterwards [1269] .

   8.  Think not therefore that this generation is human, nor as Abraham
   begat Isaac.  For in begetting Isaac, Abraham begat not what he would,
   but what another granted.  But in God the Father's begetting there is
   neither ignorance nor intermediate deliberation [1270] .  For to say
   that He knew not what He was begetting is the greatest impiety; and it
   is no less impious to say, that after deliberation in time He then
   became a Father.  For God was not previously without a Son, and
   afterwards in time became a Father; but hath the Son eternally, having
   begotten Him not as men beget men, but as Himself only knoweth, who
   begat Him before all ages Very God.

   9.  For the Father being Very God begat the Son like unto Himself, Very
   God [1271] ; not as teachers beget disciples, not as Paul says to some,
   For in Christ Jesus I begat you through the Gospel [1272] .  For in
   this case he who was not a son by nature became a son by discipleship,
   but in the former case He was a Son by nature, a true Son.  Not as ye,
   who are to be illuminated, are now becoming sons of God:  for ye also
   become sons, but by adoption of grace, as it is written, But as many as
   received Him, to them gave He the right to become children of God, even
   to them that believe on His name:  which were begotten not of blood,
   nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God [1273]
   .  And we indeed are begotten of water and of the Spirit, but not thus
   was Christ begotten of the Father.  For at the time of His Baptism
   addressing Him, and saying, This is My Son [1274] , He did not say,
   "This has now become My Son," but, This is My Son; that He might make
   manifest, that even before the operation of Baptism He was a Son.

   10.  The Father begat the Son, not as among men mind begets word.  For
   the mind is substantially existent in us; but the word when spoken is
   dispersed into the air and comes to an end [1275] .  But we know Christ
   to have been begotten not as a word pronounced [1276] , but as a Word
   substantially existing [1277] and living; not spoken by the lips, and
   dispersed, but begotten of the Father eternally and ineffably, in
   substance [1278] .  For, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
   was with God, and the Word was God [1279] , sitting at God's right
   hand;--the Word understanding the Father's will, and creating all
   things at His bidding:  the Word, which came down and went up; for the
   word of utterance when spoken comes not down, nor goes up; the Word
   speaking and saying, The things which I have seen with My Father, these
   I speak [1280] :  the Word possessed of power, and reigning over all
   things:  for the Father hath committed all things unto the Son [1281] .

   11.  The Father then begat Him not in such wise as any man could
   understand, but as Himself only knoweth.  For we profess not to tell in
   what manner He begat Him, but we insist that it was not in this
   manner.  And not we only are ignorant of the generation of the Son from
   the Father, but so is every created nature.  Speak to the earth, if
   perchance it may teach thee [1282] :  and though thou inquire of all
   things which are upon the earth, they shall not be able to tell thee.
   For the earth cannot tell the substance of Him who is its own potter
   and fashioner.  Nor is the earth alone ignorant, but the sun also
   [1283] :  for the sun was created on the fourth day, without knowing
   what had been made in the three days before him; and he who knows not
   the things made in the three days before him, cannot tell forth the
   Maker Himself.  Heaven will not declare this:  for at the Father's
   bidding the heaven also was like smoke established [1284] by Christ.
   Nor shall the heaven of heavens declare this, nor the waters which are
   above the heavens [1285] .  Why then art thou cast down, O man, at
   being ignorant of that which even the heavens know not?  Nay, not only
   are the heavens ignorant of this generation, but also every angelic
   nature.  For if any one should ascend, were it possible, into the first
   heaven, and perceiving the ranks of the Angels there should approach
   and ask them how God begat His own Son, they would say perhaps, "We
   have above us beings greater and higher; ask them."  Go up to the
   second heaven and the third; attain, if thou canst, to Thrones, and
   Dominions, and Principalities, and Powers:  and even if any one should
   reach them, which is impossible, they also would decline the
   explanation, for they know it not.

   12.  For my part, I have ever wondered at the curiosity of the bold
   men, who by their imagined reverence fall into impiety.  For though
   they know nothing of Thrones, and Dominions, and Principalities, and
   Powers, the workmanship of Christ, they attempt to scrutinise their
   Creator Himself.  Tell me first, O most daring man, wherein does Throne
   differ from Dominion, and then scrutinise what pertains to Christ.
   Tell me what is a Principality, and what a Power, and what a Virtue,
   and what an Angel:  and then search out their Creator, for all things
   were made by Him [1286] .  But thou wilt not, or thou canst not ask
   Thrones or Dominions.  What else is there that knoweth the deep things
   of God [1287] , save only the Holy Ghost, who spake the Divine
   Scriptures?  But not even the Holy Ghost Himself has spoken in the
   Scriptures concerning the generation of the Son from the Father.  Why
   then dost thou busy thyself about things which not even the Holy Ghost
   has written in the Scriptures?  Thou that knowest not the things which
   are written, busiest thou thyself about the things which are not
   written?  There are many questions in the Divine Scriptures; what is
   written we comprehend not, why do we busy ourselves about what is not
   written?  It is sufficient for us to know that God hath begotten One
   Only Son.

   13.  Be not ashamed to confess thine ignorance, since thou sharest
   ignorance with Angels.  Only He who begat knoweth Him who was begotten,
   and He who is begotten of Him knoweth Him who begat.  He who begat
   knoweth what He begat:  and the Scriptures also testify that He who was
   begotten is God [1288] .  For as the Father hath life in Himself, so
   also hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself [1289] ; and,
   that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father
   [1290] ; and, as the Father quickeneth whom He will, even so the Son
   quickeneth whom He will [1291] .  Neither He who begat suffered any
   loss, nor is anything lacking to Him who was begotten (I know that I
   have said these things many times, but it is for your safety that they
   are said so often):  neither has He who begat, a Father, nor He who was
   begotten, a brother.  Neither was He who begat changed into the Son
   [1292] , nor did He who was begotten become the Father [1293] .  Of One
   Only Father there is One Only-begotten Son:  neither two Unbegotten
   [1294] , nor two Only-begotten; but One Father, Unbegotten (for He is
   Unbegotten who hath no father); and One Son, eternally begotten of the
   Father; begotten not in time, but before all ages; not increased by
   advancement, but begotten that which He now is.

   14.  We believe then In the Only-Begotten Son of God, Who Was Begotten
   of the Father Very God.  For the True God begetteth not a false god, as
   we have said, nor did He deliberate and afterwards beget [1295] ; but
   He begat eternally, and much more swiftly than our words or thoughts:
   for we speaking in time, consume time; but in the case of the Divine
   Power, the generation is timeless.  And as I have often said, He did
   not bring forth the Son from non-existence into being, nor take the
   non-existent into sonship [1296] :  but the Father, being Eternal,
   eternally and ineffably begat One Only Son, who has no brother.  Nor
   are there two first principles; but the Father is the head of the Son
   [1297] ; the beginning is One.  For the Father begot the Son Very God,
   called Emmanuel; and Emmanuel being interpreted is, God with us [1298]
   .

   15.  And wouldest thou know that He who was begotten of the Father, and
   afterwards became man, is God?  Hear the Prophet saying, This is our
   God, none other shall be accounted of in comparison with Him. He hath
   found out every way of knowledge, and given it to Jacob His servant,
   and to Israel His beloved.  Afterwards He was seen on earth, and
   conversed among men [1299] .  Seest thou herein God become man, after
   the giving of the law by Moses?  Hear also a second testimony to
   Christ's Deity, that which has just now been read, Thy throne, O God,
   is for ever and ever [1300] .  For lest, because of His presence here
   in the flesh, He should be thought to have been advanced after this to
   the Godhead, the Scripture says plainly, Therefore God, even Thy God,
   hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows [1301] .
   Seest thou Christ as God anointed by God the Father?

   16.  Wouldest thou receive yet a third testimony to Christ's Godhead?
   Hear Esaias saying, Egypt hath laboured, and the merchandise of
   Ethiopia:  and soon after, In Thee shall they make supplication,
   because God is in Thee, and there is no God save Thee.  For Thou art
   God, and we knew it not, the God of Israel, the Saviour [1302] .  Thou
   seest that the Son is God, having in Himself God the Father:  saying
   almost the very same which He has said in the Gospels:  The Father is
   in Me, and I am in the Father [1303] .  He says not, I am the Father,
   but the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.  And again He said
   not, I and the Father am [1304] one, but, I and the Father am one, that
   we should neither separate them, nor make a confusion of Son-Father
   [1305] .  One they are because of the dignity pertaining to the
   Godhead, since God begat God.  One in respect of their kingdom; for the
   Father reigns not over these, and the Son over those, lifting Himself
   up against His Father like Absalom:  but the kingdom of the Father is
   likewise the kingdom of the Son.  One they are, because there is no
   discord nor division between them:  for what things the Father willeth,
   the Son willeth the same.  One, because the creative works of Christ
   are no other than the Father's; for the creation of all things is one,
   the Father having made them through the Son:  For He spake, and they
   were made; He commanded, and they were created, saith the Psalmist
   [1306] .  For He who speaks, speaks to one who hears:  and He who
   commands, gives His commandment to one who is present with Him.

   17.  The Son then is Very God, having the Father in Himself, not
   changed into the Father; for the Father was not made man, but the Son.
   For let the truth be freely spoken [1307] .  The Father suffered not
   for us, but the Father sent Him who suffered.  Neither let us say,
   There was a time when the Son was not; nor let us admit a Son who is
   the Father [1308] :  but let us walk in the king's highway; let us turn
   aside neither on the left hand nor on the right.  Neither from thinking
   to honour the Son, let us call Him the Father; nor from thinking to
   honour the Father, imagine the Son to be some one of the creatures.
   But let One Father be worshipped through One Son, and let not their
   worship be separated.  Let One Son be proclaimed, sitting at the right
   hand of the Father before all ages:  sharing His throne not by
   advancement in time after His Passion, but by eternal possession.

   18.  He who hath seen the Son, hath seen the Father [1309] :  for in
   all things the Son is like to Him who begat Him [1310] ; begotten Life
   of Life and Light of Light, Power of Power, God of God; and the
   characteristics of the Godhead are unchangeable [1311] in the Son; and
   he who is counted worthy to behold Godhead in the Son, attains to the
   fruition of the Father.  This is not my word, but that of the
   Only-begotten:  Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not
   known Me, Philip?  He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father [1312] .
   And to be brief, let us neither separate them, nor make a confusion
   [1313] :  neither say thou ever that the Son is foreign to the Father,
   nor admit those who say that the Father is at one time Father, and at
   another Son:  for these are strange and impious statements, and not the
   doctrines of the Church.  But the Father having begotten the Son,
   remained the Father and is not changed.  He begat Wisdom, yet lost not
   wisdom Himself; and begat Power, yet became not weak:  He begat God,
   but lost not His own Godhead:  and neither did He lose anything Himself
   by diminution or change; nor has He who was begotten any thing
   wanting.  Perfect is He who begat, Perfect that which was begotten:
   God was He who begat, God He who was begotten; God of all Himself, yet
   entitling the Father His own God.  For He is not ashamed to say, I
   ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God
   [1314] .

   19.  But lest thou shouldest think that He is in a like sense Father of
   the Son and of the creatures, Christ drew a distinction in what
   follows.  For He said not, "I ascend to our Father," lest the creatures
   should be made fellows of the Only-begotten; but He said, My Father and
   your Father; in one way Mine, by nature; in another yours, by
   adoption.  And again, to my God and your God, in one way Mine, as His
   true and Only-begotten Son, and in another way yours, as His
   workmanship [1315] .  The Son of God then is Very God, ineffably
   begotten before all ages (for I say the same things often to you, that
   it may be graven upon your mind).  This also believe, that God has a
   Son:  but about the manner be not curious, for by searching thou wilt
   not find.  Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall:  think upon those things
   only which have been commanded thee [1316] .  Tell me first what He is
   who begat, and then learn that which He begat; but if thou canst not
   conceive the nature of Him who hath begotten, search not curiously into
   the manner of that which is begotten.

   20.  For godliness it sufficeth thee to know, as we have said, that God
   hath One Only Son, One naturally begotten; who began not His being when
   He was born in Bethlehem, but Before All Ages.  For hear the Prophet
   Micah saying, And thou, Bethlehem, house of Ephrata, art little to be
   among the thousands of Judah.  Out of thee shall come forth unto Me a
   Ruler, who shall feed My people Israel:  and His goings forth are from
   the beginning, from days of eternity [1317] .  Think not then of Him
   who is now come forth out of Bethlehem [1318] , but worship Him who was
   eternally begotten of the Father.  Suffer none to speak of a beginning
   of the Son in time, but as a timeless Beginning acknowledge the
   Father.  For the Father is the Beginning of the Son, timeless,
   incomprehensible, without beginning [1319] .  The fountain of the river
   of righteousness, even of the Only-begotten, is the Father, who begat
   Him as Himself only knoweth.  And wouldest thou know that our Lord
   Jesus Christ is King Eternal?  Hear Him again saying, Your father
   Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad [1320] .
   And then, when the Jews received this hardly, He says what to them was
   still harder, Before Abraham was, I am [1321] .  And again He saith to
   the Father, And now, Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with
   the glory which I had with Thee before the world was [1322] .  He says
   plainly, "before the world was, I had the glory which is with Thee."
   And again when He says, For Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of
   the world [1323] , He plainly declares, "The glory which I have with
   thee is from eternity."

   21.  We believe then In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of
   God, Begotten of His Father Very God Before All Worlds, by Whom All
   Things Were Made.  For whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
   principalities, or powers, all things were made through Him [1324] ,
   and of things created none is exempted from His authority.  Silenced be
   every heresy which brings in different creators and makers of the
   world; silenced the tongue which blasphemes the Christ the Son of God;
   let them be silenced who say that the sun is the Christ, for He is the
   sun's Creator, not the sun which we see [1325] .  Silenced be they who
   say that the world is the workmanship of Angels [1326] , who wish to
   steal away the dignity of the Only-begotten.  For whether visible or
   invisible, whether thrones or dominions, or anything that is named, all
   things were made by Christ.  He reigns over the things which have been
   made by Him, not having seized another's spoils, but reigning over His
   own workmanship, even as the Evangelist John has said, All things were
   made by Him, and without Him was not anything made [1327] .  All things
   were made by Him, the Father working by the Son.

   22.  I wish to give also a certain illustration of what I am saying,
   but I know that it is feeble; for of things visible what can be an
   exact illustration of the Divine Power?  But nevertheless as feeble be
   it spoken by the feeble to the feeble.  For just as any king, whose son
   was a king, if he wished to form a city, might suggest to his son, his
   partner in the kingdom, the form of the city, and he having received
   the pattern, brings the design to completion; so, when the Father
   wished to form all things, the Son created all things at the Father's
   bidding, that the act of bidding might secure to the Father His
   absolute authority [1328] , and yet the Son in turn might have
   authority over His own workmanship, and neither the Father be separated
   from the lordship over His own works, nor the Son rule over things
   created by others, but by Himself.  For, as I have said, Angels did not
   create the world, but the Only-begotten Son, begotten, as I have said,
   before all ages, By Whom All Things Were Made, nothing having been
   excepted from His creation.  And let this suffice to have been spoken
   by us so far, by the grace of Christ.

   23.  But let us now recur to our profession of the Faith, and so for
   the present finish our discourse.  Christ made all things, whether thou
   speak of Angels, or Archangels, of Dominions, or Thrones.  Not that the
   Father wanted strength to create the works Himself, but because He
   willed that the Son should reign over His own workmanship, God Himself
   giving Him the design of the things to be made.  For honouring His own
   Father the Only-begotten saith, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but
   what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever He doeth, these
   also doeth the Son likewise [1329] .  And again, My Father worketh
   hitherto, and I work [1330] , there being no opposition in those who
   work.  For all Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, saith the Lord in
   the Gospels [1331] .  And this we may certainly know from the Old and
   New Testaments.  For He who said, Let us make man in our image and
   after our likeness [1332] , was certainly speaking to some one
   present.  But clearest of all are the Psalmist's words, He spake and
   they were made; He commanded, and they were created [1333] , as if the
   Father commanded and spake, and the Son made all things at the Father's
   bidding.  And this Job said mystically, Which alone spread out the
   heaven, and walketh upon the sea as on firm ground [1334] ; signifying
   to those who understand that He who when present here walked upon the
   sea is also He who aforetime made the heavens.  And again the Lord
   saith, Or didst Thou take earth, and fashion clay into a living being
   [1335] ? then afterwards, Are the gates of death opened to Thee through
   fear, and did the door-keepers of hell shudder at sight of Thee [1336]
   ? thus signifying that He who through loving-kindness descended into
   hell, also in the beginning made man out of clay.

   24.  Christ then is the Only-begotten Son of God, and Maker of the
   world.  For He was in the world, and the world was made by Him; and He
   came unto His own, as the Gospel teaches us [1337] .  And not only of
   the things which are seen, but also of the things which are not seen,
   is Christ the Maker at the Father's bidding.  For in Him, according to
   the Apostle, were all things created that are in the heavens, and that
   are upon the earth, things visible and invisible, whether thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things have been created
   by Him and for Him; and He is before all, and in Him all things consist
   [1338] .  Even if thou speak of the worlds, of these also Jesus Christ
   is the Maker by the Father's bidding.  For in these last days God spake
   unto us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, by whom also
   He made the worlds [1339] .  To whom be the glory, honour, might, now
   and ever, and world without end.  Amen.

   [1242] Matt. xvi. 17.

   [1243] Athanasius (de Synodis, § 15) quotes a passage from the Thalia
   of Arius, in which he says:  "We praise Him as without beginning,
   because of Him who has a beginning:  and adore Him as eternal, because
   of Him who in time has come to be.  He who is without beginning made
   the Son a beginning of things created." It is important, therefore, to
   notice the sense in which Cyril here calls the Son anarchos.  The word
   has two meanings, which should be clearly distinguished, (i)
   unoriginate, (ii) without beginning in time.  The former referring to
   origin, or cause, can properly be applied to the One true God, or to
   God the Father only, as it is used by Clement of Alexandria (Protrept.
   cap. v. § 65:  ton panton poieten...agnoountes, ton anarchon Theon.
   [Strom. IV. cap. xxv. § 164:  ho Theos de anarchos arche ton holon
   panteles arches poietikos].  [Stromat. V. cap. xiv. § 142:  ex arches
   anarchou].  Methodius (ob. 312 a.d. circ.) in a fragment (On things
   created, § 8, English Trans. Clark's Ante-Nic. Libr.) comments thus on
   John i. 1-3:  "And so after the peculiar unbeginning beginning, who is
   the Father, He (the Word) is the beginning of other things, by whom all
   things are made.'" In this sense Cyril has said (iv. 4) that God alone
   is "unbegotten, unoriginate:"  and in xi. 20 he explains this more
   fully,--"Suffer none to speak of a beginning of the Son in time
   (chrhoniken archen), but as a timeless beginning acknowledge the
   Father.  For the Father is the beginning of the Son, timeless,
   incomprehensible, without beginning."  From a confusion of the two
   meanings the word came to be improperly applied in the sense of
   "unoriginate" to the Son, and to the Spirit; and this improper usage is
   condemned in the 49th Apostolic Canon, which Hefele regards as amongst
   the most ancient Canons, and taken from the Apostolic Constitutions,
   vi. 11:  "If any Bishop or Presbyter shall baptize not according to our
   Lord's ordinance into the Father, and Son, and Spirit, but into three
   Unoriginates, or three Sons, or three Paracletes let him be deposed."
   (ii.) Athanasius frequently calls the Son anarchos in the sense of
   timeless,' as being the co-eternal brightness (apaugasma) of the
   Eternal Light:  see de Sent. Dionys. §§ 15, 16, 22; "God is the Eternal
   Light, which never either began or shall cease:  accordingly the
   Brightness is ever before Him, and co-exists with Him, without
   beginning and ever-begotten (anarchon kai aeigenes)."

   [1244] eis prokopen huiothesias.  Cf. § 2, note 4.

   [1245] Prototokon.  The word occurs in Heb. i. 6, which had been read
   in the Lesson before this Lecture.  The exact dogmatic sense of the
   word is carefully explained by Athanasius (c. Arian. Or. ii. 62):  "The
   same cannot be both Only-begotten and Firstborn, except in different
   relations;--that is, Only-begotten, because of His generation from the
   father, as has been said; and First-born, because of His condescension
   to the creation, and His making the many His brethren."  See Mr.
   Robertson's discussion of the word prototokos (Athan. p. 344, in this
   series), and Bp. Bull (Def. Fid. Nic. iii. 5-8).

   [1259] Ps. cx. 3.  "From the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of

   Casaub.  To ei su, achronon kai aidion; to de semeron prosphaton, all'

   Theotetos; Pisteuson, k.t.l   The words "Thou art My Son," are thus
   referred to the eternal generation, and "This day" to the birth in
   time:  whereas in the received text, followed in our translation,
   semeron refers to the timeless and eternal generation of the Son.  The
   former interpretation of Ps. ii. 7 is found in many Fathers, as for
   example in Tertullian (adv. Prax. vii. xi.), and Methodius (Conviv.
   Virg. VIII. cap. ix.):  "He says Thou art,' and not Thou hast become,'
   shewing that He had not recently attained to the position of Son....But
   the expression, This day have I begotten Thee,' signifies that He
   willed that existing already before the ages in heaven He should also
   be begotten for the world, that is that He who was before unknown
   should be made known.'  The same interpretation was held by many
   Fathers, some referring semeron to the Nativity, as Cyprian (adv.
   Judæos Testim. ii. 8), others to the Baptism (Justin M. Dialog. cap.
   lxxxviii.; Tertullian. adv. Marcion. iv. 22).  Athanasius (c. Arian.
   iv. § 27), has a long discussion on the question whether Ps. cx. 3, ek
   gastros pro heosphorou gegenneka se, refers to the eternal generation
   of the Son, or to His Nativity.

   be--"if He did not bestow from the beginning, as thou sayest, what He
   bestowed in after times."  Cyril does not here address his auditor, but
   an imaginary opponent,--"O man." Compare Athan. (de Synodis, § 26).

   [1270] The Arians appear to have made use of a dilemma:  If God begat
   with will and purpose, these preceded the begetting, and so en pote
   hote ouk en, there was a time when the Son was not:  if without will
   and purpose, then He begat in ignorance and of necessity.  The answer
   is fully given by Athanasius (c. Arian. iii. 58-67, pp. 425-431 in this
   Series).

   [1271] Athanasius (ad Episcopos Ægypti, § 13), referring to 1 John v.
   20, This is the true (halethinos) God, writes:  "But these men (the
   Arians), as if in contradiction to this, allege that Christ is not the
   true God, but that He is only called God, as are other creatures, in
   regard of His participation in the Divine nature."  Again (c. Arian.
   iii. 9), "He gave us to know that of the true Father He is the true
   Offspring (alethinon gennema).

   having originated therein."  Tertullian (adv. Prax. vii.):  "You will
   say what is a word but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the
   Grammarians teach) air when struck against, intelligible to the ear,
   but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and incorporeal thing."  Cf.

   [1282] Job xii. 8.

   [1283] In saying that the earth, the sun, and the heavens know not
   their Maker, Cyril is simply using figurative language like that of the
   passage of Job just quoted.  There is no reason to suppose that he
   accepted Origen's theory (de Principiis, II. cap. 7), that the heavenly
   bodies are living and rational beings, capable of sin.

   [1288] I have followed the reading of Codd. Coisl. Roe, Casaub. Mon.
   A., which is approved though not adopted by the Benedictine Editor.
   The common text is manifestly interpolated:  "And the Holy Spirit of
   God testifies in the Scriptures, that He who was begotten without
   beginning is God.  For what man knoweth, &c."  This insertion of 1 Cor.
   ii. 11 interrupts the argument, and is a useless repetition of the
   allusion to the same passage in § 12.

   [1292] See iv. 8, note 8, on the Sabellian doctrine, and Athanas. (de
   Synodis, § 16, note 10 in this series).

   [1293] The doctrine of Sabellius might be expressed in two forms,
   either the Father became the Son, or the Son became the Father.  Both
   forms are here denied.  The Jerusalem Editor thinks there is an
   allusion to the Arian argument mentioned by Athanasius (c. Arian. Or.
   I. cap. vi. 22):  "If the Son is the Father's offspring and Image, and
   is like in all things to the Father, then it necessarily holds that as
   He is begotten so He begets, and He too becomes father of a son."  But
   the close connexion of the two clauses is in favour of the reference to
   the Sabellian huiopatoria.

   [1294] agennetoi.  The context shews that this, not agenetoi, is here
   the right form.  Athanasius seems to have used agennetos in both senses
   "Un-begotten," as here, and "unoriginate."  Thus (c. Arian. Or. i. cap.
   ix. § 30) he says of the Arians:  "Their further question whether the
   Unoriginate be one or two,' shews how false are their views."  Compare
   Bp. Lightfoot's Excursus on Ignatius, Ephes. § 7, and Mr. Robertson's
   notes on Athanasius in this Series.

   [1295] See above, § 8, note 3.

   [1298] Matt. i. 23.

   [1299] Baruch iii. 35-37.  The last verse was understood by Cyril, as
   by many of the Greek and Latin Fathers, to be a prophecy of the
   Incarnation:  but in reality it refers to "knowledge" (episteme, v.
   36), and should be translated "she was seen upon earth."  See notes on
   the passage in the Speaker's Commentary.

   [1300] Heb. i. 8.

   [1302] Isa. xlv. 14, 15:  "They shall make supplication unto thee,
   saying, surely God is in thee."  The words are addressed to Jerusalem
   as the city of God.  Cyril applies them to the Son, misled by the
   Septuagint.

   [1303] John xiv. 11.

   [1304] Athanasius (c. Arian. Or. iv. § 9), arguing for the homoousion
   says:  "These are two, because there is Father and Son, that is the
   Word; and one, because one God.  For if this is not so, He would have
   said, I am the Father, or, I and the Father am."

   [1305] See iv. 8, notes 7 and 8.

   [1306] Psa. xxxiii. 9; cxlviii. 5.  S. Cyril explains the creative
   "Fiat" in Gen. i. as addressed by the Father to the Son.

   [1307] We learn from Socrates (Eccl. Hist. I. 24), that after the
   Nicene Council "those who objected to the word homoousios conceived
   that those who approved it favoured the opinion of Sabellius."
   Marcellus of Ancyra, who was deposed on a charge of Sabellianism, and
   who did not in fact make clear the distinct personality of the Son, had
   been warmly supported by the friends of Athanasius.  Cyril apparently
   fears to incur their censure, if he too strongly condemned the
   Sabellian view.

   [1308] Cyril here rejects both the opposite errors, Arianism, "There
   was a time when the Son was not," and Sabellianism, "a Son who is the
   Father."

   [1309] John xiv. 9.

   [1310] See above, § 4, note 9.

   [1311] aparallaktoi.  The word was used by the Orthodox Bishops at
   Nicæa, who said that "the Word must be described as the True power and
   Image of the Father, in all things like the Father and Himself
   incapable of change."  See the notes of Dr. Newman and Mr. Robertson on
   Athanasius (de Decretis, § 20).

   [1313] See iv. 8, note 8.

   [1314] John xx. 17.

   [1315] Compare Cat. vii. 7.  The Jerusalem Editor observes that the
   expression "My God" is understood by the Fathers generally as spoken by
   Christ in reference to His human nature, but Cyril applies this, as
   well as the other expression "My Father," to the Divine nature.  So
   Hilary (de Trinit. iv. 53):  "idcirco Deus ejus est, quia ex eo natus
   in Deum est."  Compare Epiphanius (Hær. lxix. 55).

   [1316] Ecclus. iii. 22.

   [1317] Micah v. 2; on the various readings olgiostos ei, me ol, ei ouk
   ol. ei, found in the mss. of Cyril, see the Commentaries on the
   quotation of the passage in Matt. ii. 6.

   [1318] Codd. Roe, Casaub. have a different reading--"Think not then of
   His having now been born in Bethlehem, and (nor) suppose Him as the Son
   of Man to be altogether recent, but worship, &c."  This is rightly
   regarded by the Benedictine and other Editors as an interpolation
   intended to avoid the apparent tendency of Cyril's language in the
   received text to separate the Virgin's Son from the Eternal Word.  Had
   Cyril so written after the Nestorian controversy arose, he would have
   appeared to favour the Nestorian formula that "Mary did not give birth
   to the Deity."  Compare Swainson (Nicene Creed, Ch. ix. § 7.)  What
   Cyril really means is that we are not to think of Christ simply as man,
   but to worship Him as God.

   nor impiously think that this sun which shall be darkened is Christ."

   [1326] The creation of the world was ascribed to Angels by the Gnostics
   generally, e.g. by Simon Magus (Irenæus, adv. Hæres. I. xxiii. § 2),
   Menander (ibid. § 5), Saturninus (ibid. xxiv. 1), Basilides (ibid. §

   Lecture XII.

   On the words Incarnate, and Made Man.

   Isaiah vii. 10-14

   "And the Lord spoke again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign, &c.:"
   and "Behold! a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call
   His name Emmanuel, &c."

   1.  Nurslings of purity and disciples of chastity, raise we our hymn to
   the Virgin-born God [1340] with lips full of purity.  Deemed [1341]
   worthy to partake of the flesh of the Spiritual Lamb [1342] , let us
   take the head together with the feet [1343] , the Deity being
   understood as the head, and the Manhood taken as the feet.  Hearers of
   the Holy Gospels, let us listen to John the Divine [1344] .  For he who
   said, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
   Word was God [1345] , went on to say, and the Word was made flesh
   [1346] .  For neither is it holy to worship the mere man, nor religious
   to say that He is God only without the Manhood.  For if Christ is God,
   as indeed He is, but took not human nature upon Him, we are strangers
   to salvation.  Let us then worship Him as God, but believe that He also
   was made Man.  For neither is there any profit in calling Him man
   without Godhead nor any salvation in refusing to confess the Manhood
   together with the Godhead.  Let us confess the presence of Him who is
   both King and Physician.  For Jesus the King when about to become our
   Physician, girded Himself with the linen of humanity [1347] , and
   healed that which was sick.  The perfect Teacher of babes [1348] became
   a babe among babes, that He might give wisdom to the foolish.  The
   Bread of heaven came down on earth [1349] that He might feed the
   hungry.

   2.  But the sons of the Jews by setting at nought Him that came, and
   looking for him who cometh in wickedness, rejected the true Messiah,
   and wait for the deceiver, themselves deceived; herein also the Saviour
   being found true, who said, I am come in My Father's name, and ye
   receive Me not:  but if another shall come in his own name, him ye will
   receive [1350] .  It is well also to put a question to the Jews.  Is
   the Prophet Esaias, who saith that Emmanuel shall be born of a virgin,
   true or false [1351] ?  For if they charge him with falsehood, no
   wonder:  for their custom is not only to charge with falsehood, but
   also to stone the Prophets.  But if the Prophet is true, point to the
   Emmanuel, and say, Whether is He who is to come, for whom ye are
   looking, to be born of a virgin or not?  For if He is not to be born of
   a virgin, ye accuse the Prophet of falsehood:  but if in Him that is to
   come ye expect this, why do ye reject that which has come to pass
   already?

   3.  Let the Jews, then, be led astray, since they so will:  but let the
   Church of God be glorified.  For we receive God the Word made Man in
   truth, not, as heretics say [1352] , of the will of man and woman, but
   of The Virgin and the Holy Ghost [1353] according to the Gospel, Made
   Man [1354] , not in seeming but in truth.  And that He was truly Man
   made of the Virgin, wait for the proper time of instruction in this
   Lecture, and thou shalt receive the proofs [1355] :  for the error of
   the heretics is manifold.  And some have said that He has not been born
   at all of a virgin [1356] :  others that He has been born, not of a
   virgin, but of a wife dwelling with a husband.  Others say that the
   Christ is not God made Man, but a man made God [1357] .  For they dared
   to say that not He--the pre-existent Word--was made Man; but a certain
   man was by advancement crowned.

   4.  But remember thou what was said yesterday concerning His Godhead.
   Believe that He the Only-begotten Son of God--He Himself was again
   begotten of a Virgin.  Believe the Evangelist John when he says, And
   the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us [1358] .  For the Word is
   eternal, Begotten of the Father Before All Worlds:  but the flesh He
   took on Him recently for our sake.  Many contradict this, and say:
   "What cause was there so great, for God to come down into humanity?
   And, is it at all God's nature to hold intercourse with men?  And, is
   it possible for a virgin to bear, without man?"  Since then there is
   much controversy, and the battle has many forms, come, let us by the
   grace of Christ, and the prayers of those who are present, resolve each
   question.

   5.  And first let us inquire for what cause Jesus came down.  Now mind
   not my argumentations, for perhaps thou mayest be misled but unless
   thou receive testimony of the Prophets on each matter, believe not what
   I say:  unless thou learn from the Holy Scriptures concerning the
   Virgin, and the place, the time, and the manner, receive not testimony
   from man [1359] .  For one who at present thus teaches may possibly be
   suspected:  but what man of sense will suspect one that prophesied a
   thousand and more years beforehand?  If then thou seekest the cause of
   Christ's coming, go back to the first book of the Scriptures.  In six
   days God made the world:  but the world was for man.  The sun however
   resplendent with bright beams, yet was made to give light to man, yea,
   and all living creatures were formed to serve us:  herbs and trees were
   created for our enjoyment.  All the works of creation were good, but
   none of these was an image of God, save man only.  The sun was formed
   by a mere command, but man by God's hands:  Let us make man after our
   image, and after our likeness [1360] .  A wooden image of an earthly
   king is held in honour; how much more a rational image of God?

   But when this the greatest of the works of creation was disporting
   himself in Paradise, the envy of the Devil cast him out.  The enemy was
   rejoicing over the fall of him whom he had envied:  wouldest thou have
   had the enemy continue to rejoice?  Not daring to accost the man
   because of his strength, he accosted as being weaker the woman, still a
   virgin:  for it was after the expulsion from Paradise that Adam knew
   his wife [1361] .

   6.  Cain and Abel succeeded in the second generation of mankind:  and
   Cain was the first murderer.  Afterwards a deluge was poured abroad
   because of the great wickedness of men:  fire came down from heaven
   upon the people of Sodom because of their transgression.  After a time
   God chose out Israel:  but Israel also turned aside, and the chosen
   race was wounded.  For while Moses stood before God in the mount, the
   people were worshipping a calf instead of God.  In the lifetime of
   Moses, the law-giver who had said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, a
   man dared to enter a place of harlotry and transgress [1362] .  After
   Moses, Prophets were sent to cure Israel:  but in their healing office
   they lamented that they were not able to overcome the disease, so that
   one of them says, Woe is me! for the godly man is perished out of the
   earth, and there is none that doeth right among men [1363] :  and
   again, They are all gone out of the way, they are together became
   unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one [1364] :  and
   again, Cursing and stealing, and adultery, and murder are poured out
   upon the land [1365] .  Their sons and their daughters they sacrificed
   unto devils [1366] .  They used auguries, and enchantments, and
   divinations [1367] .  And again, they fastened their garments with
   cords, and made hangings attached to the altar [1368] .

   7.  Very great was the wound of man's nature; from the feet to the head
   there was no soundness in it; none could apply mollifying ointment,
   neither oil, nor bandages [1369] .  Then bewailing and wearying
   themselves, the Prophets said, Who shall give salvation out of Sion
   [1370] ?  And again, Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand,
   and upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself:  so will
   not we go back from Thee [1371] .  And another of the Prophets
   entreated, saying, Bow the heavens, O Lord and come down [1372] .  The
   wounds of man's nature pass our healing.  They slew Thy Prophets, and
   cast down Thine altars [1373] .  The evil is irretrievable by us, and
   needs thee to retrieve it.

   8.  The Lord heard the prayer of the Prophets.  The Father disregarded
   not the perishing of our race; He sent forth His Son, the Lord from
   heaven, as healer:  and one of the Prophets saith, The Lord whom ye
   seek, cometh, and shall suddenly come [1374] .  Whither?  The Lord
   shall come to His own temple, where ye stoned Him.  Then another of the
   Prophets, on hearing this, saith to him:  In speaking of the salvation
   of God, speakest thou quietly?  In preaching the good tidings of God's
   coming for salvation, speakest thou in secret?  O thou that bringest
   good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain.  Speak to the
   cities of Judah.  What am I to speak?  Behold our God!  Behold! the
   Lord cometh with strength [1375] !  Again the Lord Himself saith,
   Behold! I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.
   And many nations shall flee unto the Lord [1376] .  The Israelites
   rejected salvation through Me:  I come to gather all nations and
   tongues [1377] .  For He came to His own and His own received Him not
   [1378] .  Thou comest and what dost Thou bestow on the nations?  I come
   to gather all nations, and I will leave on them a sign [1379] .  For
   from My conflict upon the Cross I give to each of My soldiers a royal
   seal to bear upon his forehead.  Another also of the Prophets said, He
   bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under His feet
   [1380] .  For His coming down from heaven was not known by men.

   9.  Afterwards Solomon hearing his father David speak these things,
   built a wondrous house, and foreseeing Him who was to come into it,
   said in astonishment, Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth
   [1381] ?  Yea, saith David by anticipation in the Psalm inscribed For
   Solomon, wherein is this, He shall come down like rain into a fleece
   [1382] :  rain, because of His heavenly nature, and into a fleece,
   because of His humanity.  For rain, coming down into a fleece, comes
   down noiselessly:  so that the Magi, not knowing the mystery of the
   Nativity, say, Where is He that is born King of the Jews [1383] ? and
   Herod being troubled inquired concerning Him who was born, and said,
   Where is the Christ to be born [1384] ?

   10.  But who is this that cometh down?  He says in what follows, And
   with the sun He endureth, and before the moon generations of
   generations [1385] .  And again another of the Prophets saith, Rejoice
   greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem.  Behold!
   thy King cometh unto thee, just and having salvation [1386] .  Kings
   are many; of which speakest thou, O Prophet?  Give us a sign which
   other Kings have not.  If thou say, A king clad in purple, the dignity
   of the apparel has been anticipated.  If thou say, Guarded by
   spear-men, and sitting in a golden chariot, this also has been
   anticipated by others.  Give us a sign peculiar to the King whose
   coming thou announcest.  And the Prophet maketh answer and saith,
   Behold! thy King cometh unto thee, just, and having salvation:  He is
   meek, and riding upon an ass and a young foal, not on a chariot.  Thou
   hast a unique sign of the King who came.  Jesus alone of kings sat upon
   an unyoked [1387] foal, entering into Jerusalem with acclamations as a
   king.  And when this King is come, what doth He?  Thou also by the
   blood of the covenant hast sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit
   wherein is no water [1388] .

   11.  But He might perchance even sit upon a foal:  give us rather a
   sign, where the King that entereth shall stand.  And give the sign not
   far from the city, that it may not be unknown to us:  and give us the
   sign plain before our eyes, that even when in the city we may behold
   the place.  And the Prophet again makes answer, saying:  And His feet
   shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before
   Jerusalem on the east [1389] .  Does any one standing within the city
   fail to behold the place?

   12.  We have two signs, and we desire to learn a third.  Tell us what
   the Lord doth when He is come.  Another Prophet saith, Behold! our God,
   and afterwards, He will come and save us.  Then the eyes of the blind
   shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear:  then shall the
   lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be
   distinct [1390] .  But let yet another testimony be told us.  Thou
   sayest, O Prophet, that the Lord cometh, and doeth signs such as never
   were:  what other clear sign tellest thou?  The Lord Himself entereth
   into judgment with the elders of His people, and with the princes
   thereof [1391] .  A notable sign!  The Master judged by His servants,
   the elders, and submitting to it.

   13.  These things the Jews read, but hear not:  for they have stopped
   the ears of their heart, that they may not hear.  But let us believe in
   Jesus Christ, as having come in the flesh and been made Man, because we
   could not receive Him otherwise.  For since we could not look upon or
   enjoy Him as He was, He became what we are, that so we might be
   permitted to enjoy Him.  For if we cannot look full on the sun, which
   was made on the fourth day, could we behold God its Creator [1392] ?
   The Lord came down in fire on Mount Sinai, and the people could not
   bear it, but said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; and
   let not God speak to us, lest we die [1393] :  and again, For who is
   there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking
   out of the midst of the fire, and shall live [1394] ?  If to hear the
   voice of God speaking is a cause of death, how shall not the sight of
   God Himself bring death?  And what wonder?  Even Moses himself saith, I
   exceedingly fear and quake [1395] .

   14.  What wouldest thou then?  That He who came for our salvation
   should become a minister of destruction because men could not bear Him?
   or that He should suit His grace to our measure?  Daniel could not bear
   the vision of an Angel, and wert thou capable of the sight of the Lord
   of Angels?  Gabriel appeared, and Daniel fell down:  and of what nature
   or in what guise was he that appeared?  His countenance was like
   lightning [1396] ; not like the sun: and his eyes as lamps of fire, not
   as a furnace of fire:  and the voice of his words as the voice of a
   multitude, not as the voice of twelve legions of angels; nevertheless
   the Prophet fell down.  And the Angel cometh unto him, saying, Fear
   not, Daniel, stand upright:  be of good courage, thy words are heard
   [1397] .  And Daniel says, I stood up trembling [1398] :  and not even
   so did he make answer, until the likeness of a man's hand touched him.
   And when he that appeared was changed into the appearance of a man,
   then Daniel spoke:  and what saith he?  O my Lord, at the vision of
   Thee my inward parts were turned within me, and no strength remaineth
   in me, neither is there breath left in me [1399] .  If an Angel
   appearing took away the Prophet's voice and strength, would the
   appearance of God have allowed him to breathe?  And until there touched
   me as it were a vision of a man [1400] , saith the Scripture, Daniel
   took not courage.  So then after trial shewn of our weakness, the Lord
   assumed that which man required:  for since man required to hear from
   one of like countenance, the Saviour took on Him the nature of like
   affections, that men might be the more easily instructed.

   15.  Learn also another cause.  Christ came that He might be baptized,
   and might sanctify Baptism:  He came that He might work wonders,
   walking upon the waters of the sea.  Since then before His appearance
   in flesh, the sea saw Him and fled, and Jordan was turned back [1401] ,
   the Lord took to Himself His body, that the sea might endure the sight,
   and Jordan receive Him without fear.  This then is one cause; but there
   is also a second.  Through Eve yet virgin came death; through a virgin,
   or rather from a virgin, must the Life appear:  that as the serpent
   beguiled the one, so to the other Gabriel might bring good tidings
   [1402] .  Men forsook God, and made carved images of men.  Since
   therefore an image of man was falsely worshipped as God, God became
   truly Man, that the falsehood might be done away.  The Devil had used
   the flesh as an instrument against us; and Paul knowing this, saith,
   But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind,
   and bringing me into captivity [1403] , and the rest.  By the very same
   weapons, therefore, wherewith the Devil used to vanquish us, have we
   been saved.  The Lord took on Him from us our likeness, that He might
   save man's nature:  He took our likeness, that He might give greater
   grace to that which lacked; that sinful humanity might become partaker
   of God.  For where sin abounded, grace did much more abound [1404] .
   It behoved the Lord to suffer for us; but if the Devil had known Him,
   he would not have dared to approach Him.  For had they known it, they
   would not have crucified the Lord of Glory [1405] .  His body therefore
   was made a bait to death that the dragon [1406] , hoping to devour it,
   might disgorge those also who had been already devoured [1407] .  For
   Death prevailed and devoured; and again, God wiped away every tear from
   off every face [1408] .

   16.  Was it without reason that Christ was made Man?  Are our teachings
   ingenious phrases and human subtleties?  Are not the Holy Scriptures
   our salvation?  Are not the predictions of the Prophets?  Keep then, I
   pray thee, this deposit [1409] undisturbed, and let none remove thee:
   believe that God became Man.  But though it has been proved possible
   for Him to be made Man, yet if the Jews still disbelieve, let us hold
   this forth to them:  What strange thing do we announce in saying that
   God was made Man, when yourselves say that Abraham received the Lord as
   a guest [1410] ?  What strange thing do we announce, when Jacob says,
   For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved [1411] ?
   The Lord, who ate with Abraham, ate also with us.  What strange thing
   then do we announce?  Nay more, we produce two witnesses, those who
   stood before Lord on Mount Sinai:  Moses was in a clift of the rock
   [1412] , and Elias was once in a clift of the rock [1413] :  they being
   present with Him at His Transfiguration on Mount Tabor, spoke to the
   Disciples of His decease which fire should accomplish at Jerusalem
   [1414] .  But, as I said before, it has been proved possible for Him to
   be made man:  and the rest of the proofs may be left for the studious
   to collect.

   17.  My statement, however, promised to declare [1415] also the time of
   the Saviour's and the place:  and I must not go away convicted of
   falsehood, but rather send away the Church's novices [1416] well
   assured.  Let us therefore inquire the time when our Lord came:
   because His coming is recent, and is disputed:  and because Christ
   Jesus is the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever [1417] .  Moses
   then, the prophet, saith, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
   unto you of your brethren, like unto me [1418] :  but let that "like
   unto me" be reserved awhile to be examined in its proper place [1419]
   .  But when cometh this Prophet that is expected?  Recur, he says, to
   what has been written by me:  examine carefully Jacob's prophecy
   addressed to Judah:  Judah, thee may thy brethren praise, and
   afterwards, not to quote the whole, A prince shall not fail out of
   Judah, nor a ruler from his loins, until He come, for whom it is
   reserved; and He is the expectation, not of the Jews but of the
   Gentiles [1420] .  He gave, therefore, as a sign of Christ's advent the
   cessation of the Jewish rule.  If they are not now under the Romans,
   the Christ is not yet come:  if they still have a prince of the race of
   Judah and of David [1421] , he is not yet come that was expected.  For
   I am ashamed to tell of their recent doings concerning those who are
   now called Patriarchs [1422] among them, and what their descent is, and
   who their mother:  but I leave it to those who know.  But He that
   cometh as the expectation of the Gentiles, what further sign then hath
   He?  He says next, Binding his foal unto the vine [1423] .  Thou seest
   that foal which was clearly announced by Zachariah [1424] .

   18.  But again thou askest yet another testimony of the time.  The Lord
   said unto Me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee:  and a
   few words further on, Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron [1425] .
   I have said before that the kingdom of the Romans is clearly called a
   rod of iron; but what is wanting concerning this let us further call to
   mind out of Daniel.  For in relating and interpreting to Nebuchadnezzar
   the image of the statue, he tells also his whole vision concerning it:
   and that a stone cut out of a mountain without hands, that is, not set
   up by human contrivance, should overpower the whole world:  and he
   speaks most clearly thus; And in the days of those kingdoms the God of
   heaven shall set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, and His
   kingdom shall not be left to another people [1426] .

   19.  But we seek still more clearly the proof of the time of His
   coming.  For man being hard to persuade, unless he gets the very years
   for a clear calculation, does not believe what is stated.  What then is
   the season, and what the manner of the time?  It is when, on the
   failure of the kings descended from Judah, Herod a foreigner succeeds
   to the kingdom?  The Angel, therefore, who converses with Daniel says,
   and do thou now mark the words, And thou shalt know and understand:
   From the going forth of the word for making answer [1427] , and for the
   building of Jerusalem, until Messiah the Prince are seven weeks and
   three score and two weeks [1428] .  Now three score and nine weeks of
   years contain four hundred and eighty-three years.  He said, therefore,
   that after the building of Jerusalem, four hundred and eighty-three
   years having passed, and the rulers having failed, then cometh a
   certain king of another race, in whose time the Christ is to be born.
   Now Darius the Mede [1429] built the city in the sixth year of his own
   reign, and first year of the 66th Olympiad according to the Greeks.
   Olympiad is the name among the Greeks of the games celebrated after
   four years, because of the day which in every four years of the sun's
   courses is made up of the three [1430] (supernumerary) hours in each
   year.  And Herod is king in the 186th Olympiad, in the 4th year
   thereof.  Now from the 66th to the 186th Olympiad there are 120
   Olympiads intervening, and a little over.  So then the 120 Olympiads
   make up 480 years:  for the other three years remaining are perhaps
   taken up in the interval between the first and fourth years.  And there
   thou hast the proof according to the Scripture which saith, From the
   going forth of the word that Jerusalem be restored and built until
   Messiah the Prince are seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.  Of the times,
   therefore, thou hast for the present this proof, although there are
   also other different interpretations concerning the aforesaid weeks of
   years in Daniel.

   20.  But now hear the place of the promise, as Micah says, And thou,
   Bethlehem, house of Ephrathah, art thou little to be among the
   thousands of Judah?  For out of thee shall come forth unto Me a ruler,
   to be governor in Israel:  and His goings forth are front the
   beginning, from the days of eternity [1431] .  But assuredly as to the
   places, thou being an inhabitant of Jerusalem, knowest also beforehand
   what is written in the hundred and thirty-first psalm.  Lo! we heard of
   it at Ephrathah, we found it in the plains of the wood [1432] .  For a
   few years ago the place was woody [1433] .  Again thou hast heard
   Habakkuk say to the Lord, When the years draw nigh, thou shalt be made
   known, when the time is come, thou shalt be shewn [1434] .  And what is
   the sign, O Prophet, of the Lord's coming?  And presently he saith, In
   the midst of two lives shalt thou be known [1435] , plainly saying this
   to the Lord, "Having come in the flesh thou livest and diest, and after
   rising from the dead thou livest again."  Further, from what part of
   the region round Jerusalem cometh He?  From east, or west, or north, or
   south?  Tell us exactly.  And he makes answer most plainly and says,
   God shall come from Teman [1436] (now Teman is by interpretation
   south') and the Holy One from Mount Paran [1437] , shady, woody:  what
   the Psalmist spake in like words, We found it in the plains of the
   wood.

   21.  We ask further, of whom cometh He and how?  And this Esaias tells
   us:  Behold! the virgin shall conceive in her womb, and shall bring
   forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel [1438] .  This the
   Jews contradict, for of old it is their wont wickedly to oppose the
   truth:  and they say that it is not written "the virgin," but "the
   damsel."  But though I assent to what they say, even so I find the
   truth.  For we must ask them, If a virgin be forced, when does she cry
   out and call for helpers, after or before the outrage?  If, therefore,
   the Scripture elsewhere says, The betrothed damsel cried, and there was
   none to save her [1439] , doth it not speak of a virgin?

   But that you may learn more plainly that even a virgin is called in
   Holy Scripture a "damsel," hear the Book of the Kings, speaking of
   Abishag the Shunamite, And the damsel was very fair [1440] :  for that
   as a virgin she was chosen and brought to David is admitted.

   22.  But the Jews say again, This was said to Ahaz in reference to
   Hezekiah.  Well, then, let us read the Scripture:  Ask thee a sign of
   the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height [1441] .  And the sign
   certainly must be something astonishing.  For the water from the rock
   was a sign, the sea divided, the sun turning back, and the like.  But
   in what I am going to mention there is still more manifest refutation
   of the Jews.  (I know that I am speaking at much length, and that my
   hearers are wearied:  but bear with the fulness of my statements,
   because it is for Christ's sake these questions are moved, and they
   concern no ordinary matters.)  Now as Isaiah spoke this in the reign of
   Ahaz, and Ahaz reigned only sixteen years, and the prophecy was spoken
   to him within these years, the objection of the Jews is refuted by the
   fact that the succeeding king, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, was twenty-five
   years old when he began to reign:  for as the prophecy is confined
   within sixteen years, he must have been begotten of Ahaz full nine
   years before the prophecy.  What need then was there to utter the
   prophecy concerning one who had been already begotten even before the
   reign of father Ahaz [1442] ?  For he said not, hath conceived, but
   "the virgin shall conceive," speaking as with foreknowledge [1443] .

   23.  We know then for certain that the Lord was to be born of a Virgin,
   but we have to shew of what family the Virgin was.  The Lord sware in
   truth unto David, and will not set it aside.  Of the fruit of body will
   I set upon thy throne [1444] :  and again, seed will I establish for
   ever, and his throne as the days of heaven [1445] .  And afterwards,
   Once have I sworn by My holiness that I will not lie unto David.  His
   seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before Me, and as
   the moon established for ever [1446] .  Thou seest that the discourse
   is of Christ, not of Solomon.  For Solomon's throne endured not as the
   sun.  But if any deny this, because Christ sat not on David's throne of
   wood, we will bring forward that saying, The Scribes and the Pharisees
   sit in Moses' seat [1447] :  for it signifies not his wooden seat, but
   the authority of his teaching.  In like manner then I would have you
   seek for David's throne not the throne of wood, but the kingdom
   itself.  Take, too, as my witnesses the children who cried
   aloud,Hosanna to the Son of David [1448] , blessed is the King of
   Israel [1449] .  And the blind men also say, Son of David, have mercy
   on us [1450] .  Gabriel too testifies plainly to Mary, saying, And the
   Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David [1451] .
   Paul also saith, Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead, of the
   seed of David, according to my Gospel [1452] :  and in the beginning of
   the Epistle to the Romans he saith, Which was made of the seed of David
   according to the flesh [1453] .  Receive thou therefore Him that was
   born of David, believing the prophecy which saith, And in that day
   there shall be a root of Jesse, and He that shall rise to rule over the
   Gentiles:  in Him shall the Gentiles trust [1454] .

   24.  But the Jews are much troubled at these things.  This also Isaiah
   foreknew, saying, And they shall wish that they had been burnt with
   fire:  for unto us a child is born (not unto them), unto us a Son is
   given [1455] .  Mark thou that at first He was the Son of God, then was
   given to us.  And a little after he says, And of His peace there is no
   bound [1456] .  The Romans have bounds:  of the kingdom of the Son of
   God there is no bound.  The Persians and the Medes have bounds, but the
   Son has no bound.  Then next, upon the throne of David, and upon his
   kingdom to order it.  The Holy Virgin, therefore, is from David.

   25.  For it became Him who is most pure, and a teacher of purity, to
   have come forth from a pure bride-chamber.  For if he who well fulfils
   the office of a priest of Jesus abstains from a wife, how should Jesus
   Himself be born of man and woman?  For thou, saith He in the Psalms,
   art He that took Me out of the womb [1457] .  Mark that carefully, He
   that took Me out of the womb, signifying that He was begotten without
   man, being taken from a virgin's womb and flesh.  For the manner is
   different with those who are begotten according to the course of
   marriage.

   26.  And from such members He is not ashamed to assume flesh, who is
   the framer of those very members.  But then who telleth us this?  The
   Lord saith unto Jeremiah:  Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew
   thee:  and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee
   [1458] .  If, then, in fashioning man He was not ashamed of the
   contact, was He ashamed in fashioning for His own sake the holy Flesh,
   the veil of His Godhead?  It is God who even now creates the children
   in the womb, as it is written in Job, Hast thou not poured me out as
   milk, and curdled me like cheese?  Thou hast clothed me with skin and
   flesh, and hast knit me together with bones and sinews [1459] .  There
   is nothing polluted in the human frame except a man defile this with
   fornication and adultery.  He who formed Adam formed Eve also, and male
   and female were formed by God's hands.  None of the members of the body
   as formed from the beginning is polluted.  Let the mouths of all
   heretics be stopped who slander their bodies, or rather Him who formed
   them.  But let us remember Paul's saying, Know ye not that your bodies
   are the temples of the Holy Ghost which is in you [1460] ?  And again
   the Prophet hath spoken before in the person of Jesus, My flesh is from
   them [1461] :  and in another place it is written, Therefore will He
   give them up, until the time that she bringeth forth [1462] .  And what
   is the sign?  He tells us in what follows, She shall bring forth, and
   the remnant of their brethren shall return.  And what are the nuptial
   pledges of the Virgin, the holy bride?  And I will betroth thee unto Me
   in faithfulness [1463] .  And Elizabeth, talking with Mary, speaks in
   like manner:  And blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a
   performance of those things which were told her from the Lord [1464] .

   27.  But both Greeks and Jews harass us and say that it was impossible
   for the Christ to be born of a virgin.  As for the Greeks we will stop
   their mouths from their own fables.  For ye who say that stones being
   thrown were changed into men [1465] , how say ye that it is impossible
   for a virgin to bring forth?  Ye who fable that a daughter was born
   from the brain [1466] , how say ye that it is impossible for a son to
   have been born from a virgin's womb?  Ye who falsely say that Dionysus
   was born from the thigh of your Zeus [1467] , how set ye at nought our
   truth?  I know that I am speaking of things unworthy of the present
   audience:  but in order that thou in due season mayest rebuke the
   Greeks, we have brought these things forward answering them from their
   own fables.

   28.  But those of the circumcision meet thou with this question:
   Whether is harder, for an aged woman, barren and past age, to bear, or
   for a virgin in the prime of youth to conceive?  Sarah was barren, and
   though it had ceased to be with her after the manner of women, yet,
   contrary to nature, she bore a child.  If, then, it is against nature
   for a barren woman to conceive, and also for a virgin, either,
   therefore, reject both, or accept both.  For it is the same God [1468]
   who both wrought the one and appointed the other.  For thou wilt not
   dare to say that it was possible for God in that former case, and
   impossible in this latter.  And again:  how is it natural for a man's
   hand to be changed in a single hour into a different appearance and
   restored again?  How then was the hand of Moses made white as snow, and
   at once restored again?  But thou sayest that God's will made the
   change.  In that case God's will has the power, and has it then no
   power in this case?  That moreover was a sign concerning the Egyptians
   only, but this was a sign given to the whole world.  But whether is the
   more difficult, O ye Jews?  For a virgin to bear, or for a rod to be
   quickened into a living creature?  Ye confess that in the case of Moses
   a perfectly straight rod became like a serpent, and was terrible to him
   who cast it down, and he who before held the rod fast, fled from it as
   from a serpent; for a serpent in truth it was:  but he fled not because
   he feared that which he held, but because he dreaded Him that had
   changed it.  A rod had teeth and eyes like a serpent:  do then seeing
   eyes grow out of a rod, and cannot a child be born of a virgin's womb,
   if God wills?  For I say nothing of the fact that Aaron's rod also
   produced in a single night what other trees produce in several years.
   For who knows not that a rod, after losing its bark, will never sprout,
   not even if it be planted in the midst of rivers?  But since God is not
   dependent on the nature of trees, but is the Creator of their natures,
   the unfruitful, and dry, and barkless rod budded, and blossomed, and
   bare almonds.  He, then, who for the sake of the typical high-priest
   gave fruit supernaturally to the rod, would He not for the sake of the
   true High-Priest grant to the Virgin to bear a child?

   29.  These are excellent suggestions of the narratives:  but the Jews
   still contradict, and do not yield to the statements concerning the
   rod, unless they may be persuaded by similar strange and supernatural
   births.  Question them, therefore, in this way:  of whom in the
   beginning was Eve begotten?  What mother conceived her the motherless?
   But the Scripture saith that she was born out of Adam's side.  Is Eve
   then born out of a man's side without a mother, and is a child not to
   be born without a father, of a virgin's womb?  This debt of gratitude
   was due to men from womankind:  for Eve was begotten of Adam, and not
   conceived of a mother, but as it were brought forth of man alone.
   Mary, therefore, paid the debt, of gratitude, when not by man but of
   herself alone in an immaculate way she conceived of the Holy Ghost by
   the power of God.

   30.  But let us take what is yet a greater wonder than this.  For that
   of bodies bodies should be conceived, even if wonderful, is
   nevertheless possible:  but that the dust of the earth should become a
   man, this is more wonderful.  That clay moulded together should assume
   the coats and splendours of the eyes, this is more wonderful.  That out
   of dust of uniform appearance should be produced both the firmness of
   bones, and the softness of lungs, and other different kinds of members,
   this is wonderful.  That clay should be animated and travel round the
   world self moved, and should build houses, this is wonderful.  That
   clay should teach, and talk, and act as carpenter, and as king, this is
   wonderful.  Whence, then, O ye most ignorant Jews, was Adam made?  Did
   not God take dust from the earth, and fashion this wonderful frame?  Is
   then clay changed into an eye, and cannot a virgin bear a son.  Does
   that which for men is more impossible take place, and is that which is
   possible never to occur?

   31.  Let us remember these things, brethren:  let us use these weapons
   in our defence.  Let us not endure those heretics who teach Christ's
   coming as a phantom.  Let us abhor those also who say that the
   Saviour's birth was of husband and wife; who have dared to say that He
   was the child of Joseph and Mary, because it is written, And he took
   unto him his wife [1469] .  For let us remember Jacob who before he
   received Rachel, said to Laban, Give me my wife [1470] .  For as she
   before the wedded state, merely because there was a promise, was called
   the wife of Jacob, so also Mary, because she had been betrothed, was
   called the wife of Joseph.  Mark also the accuracy of the Gospel,
   saying, And in the sixth month the Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
   a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose
   name was Joseph [1471] , and so forth.  And again when the census took
   place, and Joseph went up to enrol himself, what saith the Scripture?
   And Joseph also went up from Galilee, to enrol himself with Mary who
   was espoused to him, being great with child [1472] .  For though she
   was with child, yet it said not "with his wife," but with her who was
   espoused to him.  For God sent forth His Son, says Paul, not made of a
   man and a woman, but made of a woman [1473] only, that is of a virgin.
   For that the virgin also is called a woman, we shewed before [1474] .
   For He who makes souls virgin, was born of a Virgin.

   32.  But thou wonderest at the event:  even she herself who bare him
   wondered at this.  For she saith to Gabriel, How shall this be to me,
   since I know not a man?  But he says, The Holy Ghost shall came upon
   thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:  wherefore
   also the holy thing which is to be born shall be called the Son of God
   [1475] .  Immaculate and undefiled was His generation:  for where the
   Holy Spirit breathes, there all pollution is taken away:  undefiled
   from the Virgin was the incarnate generation of the Only-begotten.  And
   if the heretics gainsay the truth, the Holy Ghost shall convict them:
   that overshadowing power of the Highest shall wax wroth:  Gabriel shall
   stand face to face against them in the day of judgment:  the place of
   the manger, which received the Lord, shall put them to shame.  The
   shepherds, who then received the good tidings, shall bear witness; and
   the host of the Angels who sang praises and hymns, and said, Glory to
   God in the highest, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure
   [1476] :  the Temple into which He was then carried up on the fortieth
   day:  the pairs of turtle-doves, which were offered on His behalf
   [1477] :  and Symeon who then took Him up in his arms, and Anna the
   prophetess who was present.

   33.  Since God then beareth witness, and the Holy Ghost joins in the
   witness, and Christ says, Why do ye seek to kill me, a man who has told
   you the truth [1478] ? let the heretics be silenced who speak against
   His humanity, for they speak against Him, who saith, Handle me, and
   see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have [1479] .
   Adored be the Lord the Virgin-born, and let Virgins acknowledge the
   crown of their own state:  let the order also of Solitaries acknowledge
   the glory of chastity for we men are not deprived of the dignity of
   chastity.  In the Virgin's womb the Saviour's period of nine months was
   passed:  but the Lord was for thirty and three years a man:  so that if
   a virgin glories [1480] because of the nine months, much more we
   because of the many years.

   34.  But let us all by God's grace run the race of chastity, young men
   and maidens, old men and children [1481] ; not going after wantonness,
   but praising the name of Christ.  Let us not be ignorant of the glory
   of chastity:  for its crown is angelic, and its excellence above man.
   Let us be chary of our bodies which are to shine as the sun:  let us
   not for short pleasure defile so great, so noble a body:  for short and
   momentary is the sin, but the shame for many years and for ever.
   Angels walking upon earth are they who practise chastity:  the Virgins
   have their portion with Mary the Virgin.  Let all vain ornament be
   banished, and every hurtful glance, and all wanton gait, and every
   flowing robe, and perfume enticing to pleasure.  But in all for perfume
   let there be the prayer of sweet odour, and the practice [1482] of good
   works, and the sanctification of our bodies:  that the Virgin-born Lord
   may say even of us, both men who live in chastity and women who wear
   the crown, I will dwell in them; and walk in them, and I will be their
   God, and they shall be My people [1483] .  To whom be the glory for
   ever and ever.  Amen.

   [1340] This passage supplies a complete answer to the suspicion of a
   quasi-Nestorian tendency referred to in note 6, on xi. 20.  See x. 19,
   note 2, on the title Theotokos.

   [1341] The Present Participle (kataxioumenoi) means that the Candidates
   for Baptism were already on the way to be admitted to Holy Communion.
   Compare Cat. i. 1, where the same Candidates are addressed as
   "partakers of the mysteries of Christ, as yet by calling only, but ere
   long by grace also."

   [1342] Aubertin remarks on this passage that "this spiritual Lamb,
   consisting of head and feet, can be received only by the spiritual
   mouth."  This explanation, however true in itself, cannot fairly be
   held to express fully the meaning of Cyril.  See the section of the
   Introduction referred to in the Index, "Eucharist."

   [1343] Ex. xii. 9:  the head with the feet.  The same figurative
   interpretation is given by Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. I. ii. § 1):  "In
   Christ there is a twofold nature; and the one--in so far as He is
   thought of as God--resembles the head of the body, while the other may
   be compared with the feet,--in so far as He, for the sake of our
   salvation, put on human nature with the same passions as our own."

   Judæus (Vita Mos. III. § 11), to Prophets by Eusebius (Demostr. Evang.
   ii. 9), to Apostles by Athanasius (de Incarn. § 10:  ton autou tou
   Soteros theologon andron), and especially to St. John, because the
   chief purpose of his Gospel was to set forth the Deity of Christ.  See

   [1353] Dr. Swainson (Creeds, Chap. vii. § 7), speaking of the Creed of
   Cyril of Jerusalem, says that "the words sarkothenta kai
   enanthropesanta are found in it, but no reference whatever is made to
   the birth from the Virgin."  The present passage, and that in Cat. iv.
   § 9, "begotten of the Holy Virgin and the Holy Ghost," seems to shew
   that such a clause formed part of the Creed which Cyril was
   expounding.  The genuineness of both passages is attested by all the
   mss. and Dr. Swainson was mistaken in charging the Editors of the
   Oxford Translation with having omitted to "mention that Touttée was
   himself doubtful as to the words within the brackets" [ek Parthenou kai
   Pneumatos Agiou].  The brackets are added by Dr. Swainson himself, and
   Touttée had no doubt of the genuineness of the words:  on the contrary
   he believed them to be part of the Creed itself.  His note is as
   follows:  "The words of the Virgin and Holy Ghost I have caused to be
   printed in larger letters as if taken from the Symbol:  although they
   are wanting in the Title of this Lecture and in § 13, where the third
   Article of the Creed is referred to.  But they are read in nearly all
   the Latin and Greek Symbols, and are referred to in Cat. iv. § 9."

   [1354] enanthropesanta.  The word occurs in the true Nicene formula,
   where, as Dr. Swainson thinks, it is "scarcely ambiguous," "it is
   defective."  Both the Verb and the Substantive enanthropesis are
   constantly used by Athanasius to denote the Incarnation in a perfectly
   general way, without any indication of ambiguity or defect.  In the
   Creed proposed by Eusebius of Cæsarea instead of enanthropesanta we
   find en anthropois politeusamenon; and in the Expositio Fidei ascribed
   to Athanasius, but of somewhat doubtful authenticity, the Incarnation
   is described thus ek tes achrantou parthenou Marias ton hemeteron
   aneilephen anthropon Christon 'Iesoun.  In the Apollinarian controversy
   the attempt was made to interpret enenthropesen as meaning not that "He
   became Man," but that "He assumed a man," i.e. that "the man was first
   formed and then assumed" (Gregory, Epist. ad Cledon, quoted by
   Swainson, p. 83), or else merely that "He dwelt among men."  But the
   context of the passages in which Cyril uses the word (iv. 9; xii. 3)
   clearly shews that he employed it in the perfectly orthodox sense which
   it has in the Nicene Formula and in Athanasius.

   [1355] See below, § 21 ff.  Cyril means that the direct proof cannot be
   given at once, because there are many errors to be set aside first.
   Compare the end of § 4.

   [1356] See Cat. iv. 9, notes 3, 4.

   [1357] Athanasius (contra Arian. Or. I. § 9) quotes as from Arius,
   Thalia, "Christ is not Very God, but He, as others, was made God
   (etheopoiethe ) by participation."  The Eusebians in the Confession of
   Faith called Macrostichos (a.d. 344) condemned this view as being held
   by the disciples of Paul of Samosata, "who say that after the
   incarnation He was by advance made God, from being made by nature a
   mere man."  The orthodox use of the word Theopoieisthai is seen in
   Athan. de Incarnat. § 54:  autos enenthropesen, hina hemeis
   theopoiethomen.

   [1417] Heb. xiii. 8.  Cyril is supposed to refer to two objections to
   the Incarnation, one founded on the lateness of Christ's coming, the
   other on the Divine immutability.  But the meaning of the passage is
   not clear, and the construction of the second sentence is incomplete.

   [1418] Deut. xviii. 15; Acts vii. 37.

   [1419] exetazomenon , a clear instance of the Gerundive, or
   quasi-Future, sense of the Present Participle, common in Cyril.  "This
   intention is not fulfilled in the sequel of these Lectures" (R.W.C.).

   [1420] Gen. xlix. 8, 10.

   [1421] According to Cyril (§ 19, below) and other Fathers, the
   continuance of Jewish rulers ceased on the accession of Herod an
   Idumean.  Compare Justin M. (Tryphon §§ 52, 120); Eusebius (Demonstr.
   Evang. VIII. 1).  On modern interpretations of the passage see
   Delitzsch (New Commentary on Genesis), Briggs (Messianic Prophecy, p.
   93), Cheyne (Isaiah, Vol. II. p. 189), Driver (Journal of Philology,
   No. 27, 1885).

   [1422] A full and interesting account of the Jewish Patriarchs of the
   West established at Tiberias from the time of Antoninus Pius till the
   close of the 4th century is contained in Dean Milman's History of the
   Jews, Vol. III.  Compare Epiphanius (Hæres. xxx. § 3 ff.).

   [1423] Gen. xlix. 11.

   [1424] Zech. ix. 9, quoted above, § 10.

   [1425] Ps. ii. 7, 9.  The passage is interpreted by Cyril (xi. 5) of
   the eternal generation of the Son:  here it refers to His Incarnation,
   or perhaps is meant only to identify the Son of God with him who "shall
   rule with a rod of iron."

   [1426] Dan. ii. 44.

   [1427] Sep. tou apokrithenai, a frequent meaning of the Hebrew vyshl,
   by which the Greek Translators understood the answer of Darius to the
   Letter of Tatnai and his companions.  Both A.V. and R.V. render the
   word "to restore."

   [1428] Dan. ix. 25.

   [1429] Darius the Mede (Dan. v. 31) succeeded Belshazzar as king in
   Babylon b.c. 538, the date assigned in Dan. ix. 1 to the prophecy of
   the 70 years.  But "Darius the king" in whose 6th year (b.c. 516) the
   Temple was finished (Ezra vi. 15) was Darius Hystaspis, king of Persia,
   whom Cyril here confounds with "Darius the Mede."  He also fails to
   distinguish the rebuilding of the Temple, b.c. 516, from the rebuilding
   of the City by permission of Artaxerxes Longimanus, b.c. 444 (Nehemiah,
   ii. 1).

   [1430] In speaking of three supernumeracy hours in the year instead of
   nearly six, Cyril seems to follow the division of the diurnal period
   into twelve parts, not twenty-four.  The Jews had derived this division
   either from the Egyptians, or more probably from the Babylonians:  see
   Herodotus, II. 109.

   [1431] Micah v. 2, quoted also in Cat. xi. 20, where see note.

   [1432] Ps. cxxxii. 6.  The Psalmist refers to the recovery of the Ark,
   but Cyril interprets the passage mystically of Christ, and the place of
   His Nativity.

   [1433] The Benedictine Editor thinks that in calling the place "woody"
   Cyril refers to a grove planted by Hadrian in honour of Adonis, which
   had been destroyed about sixteen years before, when Helena built the
   Church at Bethlehem:  see Eusebius, Life of Constantine, III. 43.  But
   Cyril evidently means that the wood of which the Psalmist speaks had
   remained till a few years before.  Ephrâthah is the ancient name of
   Bethlehem (Gen. xxxv. 19; xlviii. 7), and by "the fields of the wood"
   is probably meant Kirjath-Jearim, "the city of woods," where the Ark
   was found by David (2 Sam vi. 2; 1 Chron. xiii. 6).

   [1434] Hab. iii. 2:  (R.V.) O Lord, revive Thy work in the midst of the
   years, in the midst of the years make it known.  The Septuagint gives a
   different sense:  In the midst of two lives (or, living beings) shalt
   Thou be known:  when the years draw nigh Thou shalt be recognised:
   when the time is come, Thou shalt be shewn.  The two latter clauses
   seem to be different renderings of the same Hebrew words.

   [1435] hexes.  This clause comes before the preceding quotation:  Cyril
   misplaces them.  In the Vatican and other mss. of the Sept. and in some
   Fathers zoon ("living creatures") is found in place of zoon "lives;"
   but the latter reading is evidently required by the interpretation
   which follows in Cyril.  Origen (de Principiis, I. 4), who recognises
   both readings ("In medio vel duorum animalium, vel duarum vitarum,
   cognosceris,") interprets the "two living beings" of the Son and the
   Spirit.  Eusebius (Demonstr. Evang VI. 15) observes that zoon is to be
   read as perispomenon from the Singular zoe, and interprets it of
   Christ's life with God, and life on earth.  Theodoret says, in
   commenting on the passage, "To me it seems that the Prophet means not
   "living beings" (zoa) but "lives" (zoas), the present life, and that
   which is to come, between which is the appearance of the Righteous
   Judge."

   [1436] Hab. iii. 3.  Cyril interprets the word Thaiman (Heb. nmyt") as
   a common Noun meaning "South," and the Vulgate has here "ab Austro
   veniet."  The prophecy is thus referred to Bethlehem, as lying to the
   South of Jerusalem.  Eusebius (Dem. Evang. VI. 15) mentions this as the
   rendering of Theodotion in his Greek Version, about 180 a.d.  As a
   proper name Teman denotes a district and town in the southern part of
   Idumea, so called from a grandson of Esau (Gen. xxxvi. 11, 15, 42; Jer.
   xlix. 7, 20; Ezek. xxv. 13; Amos i. 12; Obad. 9).

   [1437] The following note is slightly abridged from the Edition of
   Alexandrides of Jerusalem.  "Previous Editions read ex orous pharan
   kataskiou daseos.  This reading is found in Cod. Vat. and other mss. of
   the Septuagint, but pharan is omitted in the Aldine and many other
   copies nor was it read in the mss. of the Sept. in Jerome's time, as is
   clear from his comments on the passage.  In the mss. of Cyril, Ottob.
   R.C.V. Monac. I. and II. it is wanting.  Paran is the name of the
   desert towards the S. of Palestine lying between it and Egypt (Gen.
   xxi. 21; Num. i. 12).  There was also a Mount Paran (Deut. xxxiii. 2).
   But since Cyril applies the prophecy to Bethlehem, and the "shady
   thickly-wooded mountain" of Habakkuk is identified with "the plains of
   the wood" of David, we may safely conclude that Cyril did not read
   pharan in his copies of the Septuagint, nor write it in his Lecture:
   but the reading crept in from the later copyists, accustomed to the
   reading pharan in the Septuagint."

   [1438] Isa. vii. 14.  The objection of the Jews that the Hebrew word
   "Almah" means "a young woman," whether married or not, is mentioned by
   Justin M. (Tryph. 43, 67, 71), and by Eusebius (Dem. Evang. VII. i.
   315).

   [1439] Deut. xxii. 27.

   [1440] 1 Kings i. 4.  Cyril's argument is fully justified by the actual
   usage of "Almah," which certainly refers to unmarried women in Gen.

   Lecture XIII.

   On the words, Crucified and Buried.

   Isaiah liii. 1, 7

   Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord
   revealed?...He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, &c.

   1.  Every deed of Christ is a cause of glorying to the Catholic Church,
   but her greatest of all glorying is in the Cross; and knowing this,
   Paul says, But God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of
   Christ [1484] .  For wondrous indeed it was, that one who was blind
   from his birth should receive sight in Siloam [1485] ; but what is this
   compared with the blind of the whole world?  A great thing it was, and
   passing nature, for Lazarus to rise again on the fourth day; but the
   grace extended to him alone, and what was it compared with the dead in
   sins throughout the world?  Marvellous it was, that five loaves should
   pour forth food for the five thousand; but what is that to those who
   are famishing in ignorance through all the world?  It was marvellous
   that she should have been loosed who had been bound by Satan eighteen
   years:  yet what is this to all of us, who were fast bound in the
   chains of our sins?  But the glory of the Cross led those who were
   blind through ignorance into light, loosed all who were held fast by
   sin, and ransomed the whole world of mankind.

   2.  And wonder not that the whole world was ransomed; for it was no
   mere man, but the only-begotten Son of God, who died on its behalf.
   Moreover one man's sin, even Adam's, had power to bring death to the
   world; but if by the trespass of the one death reigned over the world,
   how shall not life much rather reign by the righteousness of the One
   [1486] ?  And if because of the tree of food they were then cast out of
   paradise, shall not believers now more easily enter into paradise
   because of the Tree of Jesus?  If the first man formed out of the earth
   brought in universal death, shall not He who formed him out of the
   earth bring in eternal life, being Himself the Life?  If Phinees, when
   he waxed zealous and slew the evil-doer, staved the wrath of God, shall
   not Jesus, who slew not another, but gave up Himself for a ransom
   [1487] , put away the wrath which is against mankind?

   3.  Let us then not be ashamed of the Cross of our Saviour, but rather
   glory in it.  For the word of the Cross is unto Jews a stumbling-block,
   and unto Gentiles foolishness, but to us salvation:  and to them that
   are perishing it is foolishness, but unto us which are being saved it
   is the power of God [1488] .  For it was not a mere man who died for
   us, as I said before, but the Son of God, God made man.  Further; if
   the lamb under Moses drove the destroyer [1489] far away, did not much
   rather the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world [1490] ,
   deliver us from our sins?  The blood of a silly sheep gave salvation;
   and shall not the Blood of the Only-begotten much rather save?  If any
   disbelieve the power of the Crucified, let him ask the devils; if any
   believe not words, let him believe what he sees.  Many have been
   crucified throughout the world, but by none of these are the devils
   scared; but when they see even the Sign of the Cross of Christ, who was
   crucified for us, they shudder [1491] .  For those men died for their
   own sins, but Christ for the sins of others; for He did no sin, neither
   was guile found in His mouth [1492] .  It is not Peter who says this,
   for then we might suspect that he was partial to his Teacher; but it is
   Esaias who says it, who was not indeed present with Him in the flesh,
   but in the Spirit foresaw His coming in the flesh.  Yet why now bring
   the Prophet only as a witness? take for a witness Pilate himself, who
   gave sentence upon Him, saying, I find no fault in this Man [1493] :
   and when he gave Him up, and had washed his hands, he said, I am
   innocent of the blood of this just person [1494] .  There is yet
   another witness of the sinlessness of Jesus,--the robber, the first man
   admitted into Paradise; who rebuked his fellow, and said, "We receive
   the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss
   [1495] ; for we were present, both thou and I, at His judgment."

   4.  Jesus then really suffered for all men; for the Cross was no
   illusion [1496] , otherwise our redemption is an illusion also.  His
   death was not a mere show [1497] , for then is our salvation also
   fabulous.  If His death was but a show, they were true who said, We
   remember that that deceiver said, while He was yet alive, After three
   days I rise again [1498] .  His Passion then was real:  for He was
   really crucified, and we are not ashamed thereat; He was crucified, and
   we deny it not, nay, I rather glory to speak of it.  For though I
   should now deny it, here is Golgotha to confute me, near which we are
   now assembled; the wood of the Cross confutes me, which was afterwards
   distributed piecemeal from hence to all the world [1499] .  I confess
   the Cross, because I know of the Resurrection; for if, after being
   crucified, He had remained as He was, I had not perchance confessed it,
   for I might have concealed both it and my Master; but now that the
   Resurrection has followed the Cross, I am not ashamed to declare it.

   5.  Being then in the flesh like others, He was crucified, but not for
   the like sins.  For He was not led to death for covetousness, since He
   was a Teacher of poverty; nor was He condemned for concupiscence, for
   He Himself says plainly, Whosoever shall look upon a woman to lust
   after her, hath committed adultery with her already [1500] ; not for
   smiting or striking hastily, for He turned the other cheek also to the
   smiter; not for despising the Law, for He was the fulfiller of the Law;
   not for reviling a prophet, for it was Himself who was proclaimed by
   the Prophets; not for defrauding any of their hire, for He ministered
   without reward and freely; not for sinning in words, or deeds, or
   thoughts, He who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth; who
   when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened
   not [1501] ; who came to His passion, not unwillingly, but willing;
   yea, if any dissuading Him say even now, Be it far from Thee, Lord, He
   will say again, Get thee behind Me, Satan [1502] .

   6.  And wouldest thou be persuaded that He came to His passion
   willingly? others, who foreknow it not, die unwillingly; but He spoke
   before of His passion:  Behold, the Son of man is betrayed to be
   crucified [1503] .  But knowest thou wherefore this Friend of man
   shunned not death?  It was lest the whole world should perish in its
   sins.  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be
   betrayed, and shall be crucified [1504] ; and again, He stedfastly set
   His face to go to Jerusalem [1505] .  And wouldest thou know certainly,
   that the Cross is a glory to Jesus?  Hear His own words, not mine.
   Judas had become ungrateful to the Master of the house, and was about
   to betray Him.  Having but just now gone forth from the table, and
   drunk His cup of blessing, in return for that drought of salvation he
   sought to shed righteous blood.  He who did eat of His bread, was
   lifting up his heel against Him [1506] ; his hands were but lately
   receiving the blessed gifts [1507] , and presently for the wages of
   betrayal he was plotting His death.  And being reproved, and having
   heard that word, Thou hast said [1508] , he again went out:  then said
   Jesus, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified [1509]
   .  Seest thou how He knew the Cross to be His proper glory?  What then,
   is Esaias not ashamed of being sawn asunder [1510] , and shall Christ
   be ashamed of dying for the world?  Now is the Son of man glorified
   [1511] .  Not that He was without glory before:  for He was glorified
   with the glory which was before the foundation of the world [1512] .
   He was ever glorified as God; but now He was to be glorified in wearing
   the Crown of His patience.  He gave not up His life by compulsion, nor
   was He put to death by murderous violence, but of His own accord.  Hear
   what He says:  I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to
   take it again [1513] :  I yield it of My own choice to My enemies; for
   unless I chose, this could not be.  He came therefore of His own set
   purpose to His passion, rejoicing in His noble deed, smiling at the
   crown, cheered by the salvation of mankind; not ashamed of the Cross,
   for it was to save the world.  For it was no common man who suffered,
   but God in man's nature, striving for the prize of His patience.

   7.  But the Jews contradict this [1514] , ever ready, as they are, to
   cavil, and backward to believe; so that for this cause the Prophet just
   now read says, Lord, who hath believed our report [1515] ?  Persians
   believe [1516] , and Hebrews believe not; they shall see, to whom He
   was not spoken of, and they that have not heard shall understand [1517]
   , while they who study these things shall set at nought what they
   study.  They speak against us, and say, "Does the Lord then suffer?
   What?  Had men's hands power over His sovereignty?"  Read the
   Lamentations; for in those Lamentations, Jeremias, lamenting you, wrote
   what is worthy of lamentations.  He saw your destruction, he beheld
   your downfall, he bewailed Jerusalem which then was; for that which now
   is [1518] shall not be bewailed; for that Jerusalem crucified the
   Christ, but that which now is worships Him.  Lamenting then he says,
   The breath of our countenance, Christ the Lord was taken in our
   corruptions [1519] .  Am I then stating views of my own?  Behold he
   testifies of the Lord Christ seized by men.  And what is to follow from
   this?  Tell me, O Prophet.  He says, Of whom we said, Under His shadow
   we shall live among the nations [1520] .  For he signifies that the
   grace of life is no longer to dwell in Israel, but among the Gentiles.

   8.  But since there has been much gainsaying by them, come, let me,
   with the help of your prayers, (as the shortness of the time may
   allow,) set forth by the grace of the Lord some few testimonies
   concerning the Passion.  For the things concerning Christ are all put
   into writing, and nothing is doubtful, for nothing is without a text.
   All are inscribed on the monuments of the Prophets; clearly written,
   not on tablets of stone, but by the Holy Ghost.  Since then thou hast
   heard the Gospel speaking concerning Judas, oughtest thou not to
   receive the testimony to it?  Thou hast heard that He was pierced in
   the side by a spear; oughtest thou not to see whether this also is
   written?  Thou hast heard that He was crucified in a garden; oughtest
   thou not to see whether this also is written?  Thou hast heard that He
   was sold for thirty pieces of silver; oughtest thou not to learn what
   prophet spake this?  Thou hast heard that He was given vinegar to
   drink; learn where this also is written.  Thou hast heard that His body
   was laid in a rock, and that a stone was set over it; oughtest thou not
   to receive this testimony also from the prophet?  Thou hast heard that
   He was crucified with robbers; oughtest thou not to see whether this
   also is written?  Thou hast heard that He was buried; oughtest thou not
   to see whether the circumstances of His burial are anywhere accurately
   written?  Thou hast heard that He rose again; oughtest thou not to see
   whether we mock thee in teaching these things?  For our speech and our
   preaching is not in persuasive words of man's wisdom [1521] .  We stir
   now no sophistical contrivances; for these become exposed; we do not
   conquer words with words [1522] , for these come to an end; but we
   preach Christ Crucified [1523] , who has already been preached
   aforetime by the Prophets.  But do thou, I pray, receive the
   testimonies, and seal them in thine heart.  And, since they are many,
   and the rest of our time is narrowed into a short space, listen now to
   a few of the more important as time permits; and having received these
   beginnings, be diligent and seek out the remainder.  Let not thine hand
   be only stretched out to receive, but let it be also ready to work
   [1524] .  God gives all things freely.  For if any of you lack wisdom,
   let him ask of God who giveth [1525] , and he shall receive.  May He
   through your prayer grant utterance to us who speak, and faith to you
   who hear.

   9.  Let us then seek the testimonies to the Passion of Christ:  for we
   are met together, not now to make a speculative exposition of the
   Scriptures, but rather to be certified of the things which we already
   believe.  Now thou hast received from me first the testimonies
   concerning the coming of Jesus; and concerning His walking on the sea,
   for it is written, Thy way is in the sea [1526] .  Also concerning
   divers cures thou hast on another occasion received testimony.  Now
   therefore I begin from whence the Passion began.  Judas was the
   traitor, and he came against Him, and stood, speaking words of peace,
   but plotting war.  Concerning him, therefore, the Psalmist says, My
   friends and My neighbours drew near against Me, and stood [1527] .  And
   again, Their words were softer than oil, yet be they spears [1528] .
   Hail, Master [1529] ; yet he was betraying his Master to death; he was
   not abashed at His warning, when He said, Judas, betrayest than the Son
   of Man with a kiss [1530] ? for what He said to him was just this,
   Recollect thine own name; Judas means confession [1531] ; thou hast
   covenanted, thou hast received the money, make confession quickly.  O
   God, pass not over My praise in silence; for the mouth of the wicked,
   and the mouth of the deceitful, are opened against Me; they have spoken
   against Me with a treacherous tongue, they have compassed Me about also
   with words of hatred [1532] .  But that some of the chief-priests also
   were present, and that He was put in bonds before the gates of the
   city, thou hast heard before, if thou rememberest the exposition of the
   Psalm, which has told the time and the place; how they returned at
   evening, and hungered like dogs, and encompassed the city [1533] .

   10.  Listen also for the thirty pieces of silver.  And I will say to
   them, If it be good in your sight, give me my price, or refuse [1534] ,
   and the rest.  One price is owing to Me from you for My healing the
   blind and lame, and I receive another; for thanksgiving, dishonour, and
   for worship, insult.  Seest thou how the Scripture foresaw these
   things?  And they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver [1535]
   .  How exact the prophecy! how great and unerring the wisdom of the
   Holy Ghost!  For he said, not ten, nor twenty, but thirty, exactly as
   many as there were.  Tell also what becomes of this price, O Prophet!
   Does he who received it keep it? or does he give it back? and after he
   has given it back, what becomes of it?  The Prophet says then, And I
   took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the house of the
   Lord, into the foundry [1536] .  Compare the Gospel with the Prophecy:
   Judas, it says, repented himself, and cast down the pieces of silver in
   the temple, and departed [1537] .

   11.  But now I have to seek the exact solution of this seeming
   discrepancy.  For they who make light of the prophets, allege that the
   Prophet says on the one hand, And I cast them into the house of the
   Lord, into the foundry, but the Gospel on the other hand, And they gave
   them for the potter's field [1538] .  Hear then how they are both
   true.  For those conscientious Jews forsooth, the high-priests of that
   time, when they saw that Judas repented and said, I have sinned, in
   that I have betrayed innocent blood, reply, What is that to us, see
   thou to that [1539] .  Is it then nothing to you, the crucifiers? but
   shall he who received and restored the price of murder see to it, and
   shall ye the murderers not see to it?  Then they say among themselves,
   It is not lawful to cast them into the treasury, because it is the
   price of blood [1540] .  Out of your own mouths is your condemnation;
   if the price is polluted, the deed is polluted also:  but if thou art
   fulfilling righteousness in crucifying Christ, why receivest thou not
   the price of it?  But the point of iniquity is this:  how is there no
   disagreement, if the Gospel says, the potter's field, and the Prophet,
   the foundry?  Nay, but not only people who are goldsmiths, or
   brass-founders, have a foundry, but potters also have foundries for
   their clay.  For they sift off the fine and rich and useful earth from
   the gravel, and separate from it the mass of the refuse matter, and
   temper the clay first with water, that they may work it with ease into
   the forms intended.  Why then wonderest thou that the Gospel says
   plainly the potter's field, whereas the Prophet spoke his prophecy like
   an enigma, since prophecy is in many places enigmatical?

   12.  They bound Jesus, and brought Him into the hall of the
   High-priest.  And wouldest thou learn and know that this also is
   written?  Esaias says, Woe unto their soul, for they have taken evil
   counsel against themselves, saying, Let us bind the Just, for He is
   troublesome to us [1541] .  And truly, Woe unto their soul!  Let us see
   how Esaias was sawn asunder, yet after this the people was restored.
   Jeremias was cast into the mire of the cistern, yet was the wound of
   the Jews healed; for the sin was less, since it was against man.  But
   when the Jews sinned, not against man, but against God in man's nature,
   Woe unto their soul!--Let us bind the Just; could He not then set
   Himself free, some one will say; He, who freed Lazarus from the bonds
   of death on the fourth day, and loosed Peter from the iron bands of a
   prison?  Angels stood ready at hand, saying, Let us burst their bands
   in sunder [1542] ; but they hold back, because their Lord willed to
   undergo it.  Again, He was led to the judgment-seat before the Elders;
   thou hast already the testimony to this, The Lord Himself will come
   into judgment with the ancients of His people, and with the princes
   thereof [1543] .

   13.  But the High-priest having questioned Him, and heard the truth, is
   wroth; and the wicked officer of wicked men smites Him; and the
   countenance, which had shone as the sun, endured to be smitten by
   lawless hands.  Others also come and spit on the face of Him, who by
   spittle had healed the man who was blind from his birth.  Do ye thus
   requite the Lord?  This people is foolish and unwise [1544] .  And the
   Prophet greatly wondering, says, Lord, who hath believed our report
   [1545] ? for the thing is incredible, that God, the Son of God, and the
   Arm of the Lord [1546] , should suffer such things.  But that they who
   are being saved may not disbelieve, the Holy Ghost writes before, in
   the person of Christ, who says, (for He who then spake these things,
   was afterward Himself an actor in them,) I gave My back to the
   scourges; (for Pilate, when he had scourged Him, delivered Him to be
   crucified [1547] ;) and My cheeks to smitings; and My face I turned not
   away from the shame of spittings; saying, as it were, "Though knowing
   before that they will smite Me, I did not even turn My cheek aside; for
   how should I have nerved My disciples against death for truth's sake,
   had I Myself dreaded this?"  I said. He that loveth his life shall lose
   it [1548] :  if I had loved My life, how was I to teach without
   practising what I taught?  First then, being Himself God, He endured to
   suffer these things at the hands of men; that after this, we men, when
   we suffer such things at the hands of men for His sake, might not be
   ashamed.  Thou seest that of these things also the prophets have
   clearly written beforehand.  Many, however, of the Scripture
   testimonies I pass by for want of time, as I said before; for if one
   should exactly search out all, not one of the things concerning Christ
   would be left without witness.

   14.  Having been bound, He came from Caiaphas to Pilate,--is this too
   written? yes; And having bound Him, they led Him away as a present to
   the king of Jarim [1549] .  But here some sharp hearer will object,
   "Pilate was not a king," (to leave for a while the main parts of the
   question,) "how then having bound Him, led they Him as a present to the
   king?"  But read thou the Gospel; When Pilate heard that He was of
   Galilee, he sent Him to Herod [1550] ; for Herod was then king, and was
   present at Jerusalem.  And now observe the exactness of the Prophet;
   for he says, that He was sent as a present; for the same day Pilate and
   Herod were made friends together, for before they were at enmity [1551]
   .  For it became Him who was on the eve of making peace between earth
   and heaven, to make the very men who condemned Him the first to be at
   peace; for the Lord Himself was there present, who reconciles [1552]
   the hearts of the princes of the earth.  Mark the exactness of the
   Prophets, and their true testimony.

   15.  Look with awe then at the Lord who was judged.  He suffered
   Himself to be led and carried by soldiers.  Pilate sat in judgment, and
   He who sitteth on the right hand of the Father, stood and was judged
   [1553] .  The people whom He had redeemed from the land of Egypt, and
   oftimes from other places, shouted against Him, Away with Him, away
   with Him, crucify Him [1554] .  Wherefore, O ye Jews? because He healed
   your blind? or because He made your lame to walk, and bestowed His
   other benefits?  So that the Prophet in amazement speaks of this too,
   Against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye let
   loose your tongue [1555] ? and the Lord Himself says in the Prophets,
   Mine heritage became unto Me as a lion in the forest; it gave its voice
   against Me; therefore have I hated it [1556] .  I have not refused
   them, but they have refused Me; in consequence thereof I say, I have
   forsaken My house [1557] .

   16.  When He was judged, He held His peace; so that Pilate was moved
   for Him, and said, Hearest Thou not what these witness against Thee
   [1558] ?  Not that He knew Him who was judged, but he feared his own
   wife's dream which had been reported to him.  And Jesus held His
   peace.  The Psalmist says, And I became as a man that heareth not; and
   in whose mouth are no reproofs [1559] ; and again, But I was as a deaf
   man and heard not; and as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth [1560]
   .  Thou hast before heard concerning this [1561] , if thou rememberest.

   17.  But the soldiers who crowd around mock Him, and their Lord becomes
   a sport to them, and upon their Master they make jests.  When they
   looked on Me, they shaked their heads [1562] .  Yet the figure of
   kingly state appears; for though in mockery, yet they bend the knee.
   And the soldiers before they crucify Him, put on Him a purple robe, and
   set a crown on His head; for what though it be of thorns?  Every king
   is proclaimed by soldiers; and Jesus also must in a figure be crowned
   by soldiers; so that for this cause the Scripture says in the
   Canticles, Go forth, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, and look upon King
   Solomon in the crown wherewith His mother crowned Him [1563] .  And the
   crown itself was a mystery; for it was a remission of sins, a release
   from the curse.

   18.  Adam received the sentence, Cursed is the ground in thy labours;
   thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee [1564] .  For this
   cause Jesus assumes the thorns, that He may cancel the sentence; for
   this cause also was He buried in the earth, that the earth which had
   been cursed might receive the blessing instead of a curse.  At the time
   of the sin, they clothed themselves with fig-leaves; for this cause
   Jesus also made the fig-tree the last of His signs.  For when about to
   go to His passion, He curses the fig-tree, not every fig-tree, but that
   one alone, for the sake of the figure; saying, No more let any man eat
   fruit of thee [1565] ; let the doom be cancelled.  And because they
   aforetime clothed themselves with fig-leaves, He came at a season when
   food was not wont to be found on the fig-tree.  Who knows not that in
   winter-time the fig-tree bears no fruit, but is clothed with leaves
   only?  Was Jesus ignorant of this, which all knew?  No, but though He
   knew, yet He came as if seeking; not ignorant that He should not find,
   but shewing that the emblematical curse extended to the leaves only.

   19.  And since we have touched on things connected with Paradise, I am
   truly astonished at the truth of the types.  In Paradise was the Fall,
   and in a Garden was our Salvation.  From the Tree came sin, and until
   the Tree sin lasted.  In the evening, when the Lord walked in the
   Garden, they hid themselves [1566] ; and in the evening the robber is
   brought by the Lord into Paradise.  But some one will say to me, "Thou
   art inventing subtleties; shew me from some prophet the Wood of the
   Cross; except thou give me a testimony from a prophet, I will not be
   persuaded.  Hear then from Jeremias, and assure thyself; I was like a
   harmless lamb led to be slaughtered; did I not know it [1567] ? (for in
   this manner read it as a question, as I have read it; for He who said,
   Ye know that after two days comes the passover, and the Son of Man is
   betrayed to be crucified [1568] , did He not know?) I was like a
   harmless lamb led to be slaughtered; did I not know it? (but what sort
   of lamb? let John the Baptist interpret it, when he says, Behold the
   Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world [1569] .)  They
   devised against Me a wicked device, saying [1570] --(He who knows the
   devices, knew He not the result of them?  And what said they?)--Come,
   and let us place a beam upon His bread [1571] --(and if the Lord reckon
   thee worthy, thou shalt hereafter learn, that His body according to the
   Gospel bore the figure of bread;)--Come then, and let us place a beam
   upon His bread, and cut Him off out of the land of the living;--(life
   is not cut off, why labour ye for nought?)--And His name shall be
   remembered no more.  Vain is your counsel; for before the sun His Name
   [1572] abideth in the Church.  And that it was Life, which hung on the
   Cross, Moses says, weeping, And thy life shall be hanging before thine
   eyes; and thou shalt be afraid day and night, and thou shalt not trust
   thy life [1573] .  And so too, what was just now read as the text,
   Lord, who hath believed our report?

   20.  This was the figure which Moses completed by fixing the serpent to
   a cross, that whoso had been bitten by the living serpent, and looked
   to the brasen serpent, might be saved by believing [1574] .  Does then
   the brazen serpent save when crucified, and shall not the Son of God
   incarnate save when crucified also?  On each occasion life comes by
   means of wood.  For in the time of Noe the preservation of life was by
   an ark of wood.  In the time of Moses the sea, on beholding the
   emblematical rod, was abashed at him who smote it; is then Moses' rod
   mighty, and is the Cross of the Saviour powerless?  But I pass by the
   greater part of the types, to keep within measure.  The wood in Moses'
   case sweetened the water; and from the side of Jesus the water flowed
   upon the wood.

   21.  The beginning of signs under Moses was blood and water; and the
   last of all Jesus' signs was the same.  First, Moses changed the river
   into blood; and Jesus at the last gave forth from His side water with
   blood.  This was perhaps on account of the two speeches, his who judged
   Him, and theirs who cried out against Him; or because of the believers
   and the unbelievers.  For Pilate said, I am innocent and washed his
   hands in water; they who cried out against Him said, His blood be upon
   us [1575] :  there came therefore these two out of His side; the water,
   perhaps, for him who judged Him; but for them that shouted against Him
   the blood.  And again it is to be understood in another way; the blood
   for the Jews, and the water for the Christians:  for upon them as
   plotters came the condemnation from the blood; but to thee who now
   believest, the salvation which is by water.  For nothing has been done
   without a meaning.  Our fathers who have written comments have given
   another reason of this matter.  For since in the Gospels the power of
   salutary Baptism is twofold, one which is granted by means of water to
   the illuminated, and a second to holy martyrs, in persecutions, through
   their own blood, there came out of that saving Side blood and water
   [1576] , to confirm the grace of the confession made for Christ,
   whether in baptism, or on occasions of martyrdom.  There is another
   reason also for mentioning the Side.  The woman, who was formed from
   the side, led the way to sin; but Jesus who came to bestow the grace of
   pardon on men and women alike, was pierced in the side for women, that
   He might undo the sin.

   22.  And whoever will inquire, will find other reasons also; but what
   has been said is enough, because of the shortness of the time, and that
   the attention of my hearers may not become sated.  And yet we never can
   be tired of hearing concerning the crowning of our Lord, and least of
   all in this most holy Golgotha.  For others only hear, but we both see
   and handle.  Let none be weary; take thine armour against the
   adversaries in the cause of the Cross itself; set up the faith of the
   Cross as a trophy against the gainsayers.  For when thou art going to
   dispute with unbelievers concerning the Cross of Christ, first make
   with thy hand the sign of Christ's Cross, and the gainsayer will be
   silenced.  Be not ashamed to confess the Cross; for Angels glory in it,
   saying, We know whom ye seek, Jesus the Crucified [1577] .  Mightest
   thou not say, O Angel, "I know whom ye seek, my Master?"  But, "I," he
   says with boldness, "I know the Crucified."  For the Cross is a Crown,
   not a dishonour.

   23.  Now let us recur to the proof out of the Prophets which I spoke
   of.  The Lord was crucified; thou hast received the testimonies.  Thou
   seest this spot of Golgotha!  Thou answerest with a shout of praise, as
   if assenting.  See that thou recant not in time of persecution.
   Rejoice not in the Cross in time of peace only, but hold fast the same
   faith in time of persecution also; be not in time of peace a friend of
   Jesus, and His foe in time of wars.  Thou receivest now remission of
   thy sins, and the gifts of the King's spiritual bounty; when war shall
   come, strive thou nobly for thy King.  Jesus, the Sinless, was
   crucified for thee; and wilt not thou be crucified for Him who was
   crucified for thee?  Thou art not bestowing a favour, for thou hast
   first received; but thou art returning a favour, repaying thy debt to
   Him who was crucified for thee in Golgotha.  Now Golgotha is
   interpreted, "the place of a skull."  Who were they then, who
   prophetically named this spot Golgotha, in which Christ the true Head
   endured the Cross?  As the Apostle says, Who is the Image of the
   Invisible God; and a little after, and He is the Head of the body, the
   Church [1578] .  And again, The Head of every man is Christ [1579] ;
   and again, Who is the Head of all principality and power [1580] .  The
   Head suffered in "the place of the skull."  O wondrous prophetic
   appellation!  The very name also reminds thee, saying, "Think not of
   the Crucified as of a mere man; He is the Head of all principality and
   power.  That Head which was crucified is the Head of all power, and has
   for His Head the Father; for the Head of the man is Christ, and the
   Head of Christ is God [1581] ."

   24.  Christ then was crucified for us, who was judged in the night,
   when it was cold, and therefore a fire of coals [1582] was laid.  He
   was crucified at the third hour; and from the sixth hour there was
   darkness until the ninth hour [1583] ; but from the ninth hour there
   was light again.  Are these things also written?  Let us inquire.  Now
   the Prophet Zacharias says, And it shall come to pass in that day, that
   there shall not be light, and there shall be cold and frost one day;
   (the cold on account of which Peter warmed himself;) And that day shall
   be known unto the Lord [1584] ; (what, knew He not the other days? days
   are many, but this is the day of the Lord's patience, which the Lord
   made [1585] ;)--And that day shall be known unto the Lord, not day, and
   not night:  what is this dark saying which the Prophet speaks?  That
   day is neither day nor night? what then shall we name it?  The Gospel
   interprets it, by relating the event.  It was not day; for the sun
   shone not uniformly from his rising to his setting, but from the sixth
   hour till the ninth hour, there was darkness at mid-day.  The darkness
   therefore was interposed; but God called the darkness night [1586] .
   Wherefore it was neither day nor night:  for neither was it all light,
   that it should be called day; nor was it all darkness, that it should
   be called night; but after the ninth hour the sun shone forth.  This
   also the Prophet foretels; for after saying, Not day, nor night, he
   added, And at evening time it shall be light [1587] .  Seest thou the
   exactness of the prophets?  Seest thou the truth of the things which
   were written aforetime?

   25.  But dost thou ask exactly at what hour the sun failed [1588] ? was
   it the fifth hour, or the eighth, or the tenth?  Tell, O Prophet, the
   exact time thereof to the Jews, who are unwilling to hear; when shall
   the sun go down?  The Prophet Amos answers, And it shall come to pass
   in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at noon
   (for there was darkness from the sixth hour;) and the light shall grow
   dark over the earth in the day [1589] ."  What sort of season is this,
   O Prophet, and what sort of day?  And I will turn your feasts into
   mourning; for this was done in the days of unleavened bread, and at the
   feast of the Passover:  then afterwards he says, And I will make Him as
   the mourning of an Only Son, and those with Him as a day of anguish
   [1590] ; for in the day of unleavened bread, and at the feast, their
   women were wailing and weeping, and the Apostles had hidden themselves
   and were in anguish.  Wonderful then is this prophecy.

   26.  But, some one will say, "Give me yet another sign; what other
   exact sign is there of that which has come to pass?  Jesus was
   crucified; and He wore but one coat, and one cloak:  now His cloak the
   soldiers shared among themselves, having rent it into four; but His
   coat was not rent, for when rent it would have been no longer of any
   use; so about this lots are cast by the soldiers; thus the one they
   divide, but for the other they cast lots.  Is then this also written?
   They know, the diligent chanters [1591] of the Church, who imitate the
   Angel hosts, and continually sing praises to God:  who are thought
   worthy to chant Psalms in this Golgotha, and to say, They parted My
   garments among them, and upon My vesture they did cast lots [1592] .
   The "lots" were what the soldiers cast [1593] .

   27.  Again, when He had been judged before Pilate, He was clothed in
   red; for there they put on Him a purple robe.  Is this also written?
   Esaias saith, Who is this that cometh from Edom? the redness of His
   garments is from Bosor [1594] ; (who is this who in dishonor weareth
   purple?  For Bosor has some such meaning in Hebrew [1595] .)  Why are
   Thy garments red, and Thy raiment as from a trodden wine-press?  But He
   answers and says, All day long have I stretched forth Mine hands unto a
   disobedient and gainsaying people [1596] .

   28.  He stretched out His hands on the Cross, that He might embrace the
   ends of the world; for this Golgotha is the very centre of the earth.
   It is not my word, but it is a prophet who hath said, Thou hast wrought
   salvation in the midst of the earth [1597] .  He stretched forth human
   hands, who by His spiritual hands had established the heaven; and they
   were fastened with nails, that His manhood, which here the sins of men,
   having been nailed to the tree, and having died, sin might die with it,
   and we might rise again in righteousness.  For since by one man came
   death, by One Man came also life [1598] ; by One Man, the Saviour,
   dying of His own accord:  for remember what He said, I have power to
   lay down My life, and I have power to take it again [1599] .

   29.  But though He endured these things, having come for the salvation
   of all, yet the people returned Him an evil recompense.  Jesus saith, I
   thirst [1600] ,--He who had brought forth the waters for them out of
   the craggy rock; and He asked fruit of the Vine which He had planted.
   But what does the Vine?  This Vine, which was by nature of the holy
   fathers, but of Sodom by purpose of heart;--(for their Vine is of
   Sodom, and their tendrils of Gomorrah [1601] ;)--this Vine, when the
   Lord was athirst, having filled a sponge and put it on a reed, offers
   Him vinegar.  They gave Me also gall for My meat, and in My thirst,
   they gave Me vinegar to drink [1602] .  Thou seest the clearness of the
   Prophets' description.  But what sort of gall put they into My mouth?
   They gave Him, it says, wine mingled with myrrh [1603] .  Now myrrh is
   in taste like gall, and very bitter.  Are these things what ye
   recompense unto the Lord?  Are these thy offerings, O Vine, unto thy
   Master?  Rightly did the Prophet Esaias aforetime bewail you, saying,
   My well-beloved had a vineyard in a hill in a fruitful place; and (not
   to recite the whole) I waited, he says, that it should bring forth
   grapes; I thirsted that it should give wine; but it brought forth
   thorns [1604] ; for thou seest the crown, wherewith I am adorned.  What
   then shall I now decree?  I will command the clouds that they rain no
   rain upon it [1605] .  For the clouds which are the Prophets were
   removed from them, and are for the future in the Church; as Paul says,
   Let the Prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge [1606] ;
   and again, God gave in the Church, some, Apostles, and some, Prophets
   [1607] .  Agabus, who bound his own feet and hands, was a prophet.

   30.  Concerning the robbers who were crucified with Him, it is written,
   And He was numbered with the transgressors [1608] .  Both of them were
   before this transgressors, but one was so no longer.  For the one was a
   transgressor to the end, stubborn against salvation; who, though his
   hands were fastened, smote with blasphemy by his tongue.  When the Jews
   passing by wagged their heads, mocking the Crucified, and fulfilling
   what was written, When they looked on Me, they shaked their heads
   [1609] , he also reviled with them.  But the other rebused the reviler;
   and it was to him the end of life and the beginning of restoration; the
   surrender of his soul a first share in salvation.  And after rebuking
   the other, he says, Lord, remember me [1610] ; for with Thee is my
   account.  Heed not this man, for the eyes of his understanding are
   blinded; but remember me.  I say not, remember my works, for of these I
   am afraid.  Every man has a feeling for his fellow-traveller; I am
   travelling with Thee towards death; remember me, Thy fellow-wayfarer.
   I say not, Remember me now, but, when Thou comest in Thy kingdom.

   31.  What power, O robber, led thee to the light?  Who taught thee to
   worship that despised Man, thy companion on the Cross?  O Light
   Eternal, which gives light to them that are in darkness!  Therefore
   also he justly heard the words, Be of good cheer [1611] ; not that thy
   deeds are worthy of good cheer; but that the King is here, dispensing
   favours.  The request reached unto a distant time; but the grace was
   very speedy.  Verily I say unto thee, This day shalt thou be with Me in
   Paradise; because to-day thou hast heard My voice, and hast not
   hardened thine heart [1612] .  Very speedily I passed sentence upon
   Adam, very speedily I pardon thee.  To him it was said, In the day
   wherein ye eat, ye shall surely die [1613] ; but thou to-day hast
   obeyed the faith, to-day is thy salvation.  Adam by the Tree fell away;
   thou by the Tree art brought into Paradise.  Fear not the serpent; he
   shall not cast thee out; for he is fallen from heaven [1614] .  And I
   say not unto thee, This day shalt thou depart, but, This day shalt thou
   be with Me.  Be of good courage:  thou shalt not be cast out.  Fear not
   the flaming sword; it shrinks from its Lord [1615] .  O mighty and
   ineffable grace!  The faithful Abraham had not yet entered, but the
   robber enters [1616] !  Moses and the Prophets had not yet entered, and
   the robber enters though a breaker of the law.  Paul also wondered at
   this before thee, saying, Where sin abounded, there grace did much more
   abound [1617] .  They who had borne the heat of the day had not yet
   entered; and he of the eleventh hour entered.  Let none murmur against
   the goodman of the house, for he says, Friend, I do thee no wrong; is
   it not lawful for Me to do what I will with Mine own [1618] ?  The
   robber has a will to work righteousness, but death prevents him; I wait
   not exclusively for the work, but faith also I accept.  I am come who
   feed My sheep among the lilies [1619] , I am come to feed them in the
   gardens.  I have found a sheep that was lost [1620] , but I lay it on
   My shoulders; for he believes, since he himself has said, I have gone
   astray like a lost sheep [1621] ; Lord, remember me when Thou comest in
   Thy kingdom.

   32.  Of this garden I sang of old to My spouse in the Canticles, and
   spoke to her thus.  I am come into My garden, My sister, My spouse
   [1622] ; (now in the place where He was crucified was a garden [1623]
   ;) and what takest Thou thence?  I have gathered My myrrh; having drunk
   wine mingled with myrrh, and vinegar, after receiving which, He said,
   It is finished [1624] .  For the mystery has been fulfilled; the things
   that are written have been accomplished; sins are forgiven.  For Christ
   being come an High-Priest of the good things to come, by the greater
   and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not
   of this creation, nor yet by the blood of goats and calves, but by His
   own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained
   eternal redemption; for if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the
   ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the defiled, sanctifieth to the
   purifying of the flesh, how much more the blood of Christ [1625] ?  And
   again, Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
   by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He hath
   consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh [1626]
   .  And because His flesh, this veil, was dishonoured, therefore the
   typical veil of the temple was rent asunder, as it is written, And,
   behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
   bottom [1627] ; for not a particle of it was left; for since the Master
   said, Behold, your house is left unto you desolate [1628] , the house
   brake all in pieces.

   33.  These things the Saviour endured, and made peace through the Blood
   of His Cross, for things in heaven, and things in earth [1629] .  For
   we were enemies of God through sin, and God had appointed the sinner to
   die.  There must needs therefore have happened one of two things;
   either that God, in His truth, should destroy all men, or that in His
   loving-kindness He should cancel the sentence.  But behold the wisdom
   of God; He preserved both the truth of His sentence, and the exercise
   of His loving-kindness.  Christ took our sins in His body on the tree,
   that we by His death might die to sin, and live unto righteousness
   [1630] .  Of no small account was He who died for us; He was not a
   literal sheep; He was not a mere man; He was more than an Angel; He was
   God made man.  The transgression of sinners was not so great as the
   righteousness of Him who died for them; the sin which we committed was
   not so great as the righteousness which He wrought who laid down His
   life for us,--who laid it down when He pleased, and took it again when
   He pleased.  And wouldest thou know that He laid not down His life by
   violence, nor yielded up the ghost against His will?  He cried to the
   Father, saying, Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit [1631] ; I
   commend it, that I may take it again.  And having said these things, He
   gave up the ghost [1632] ; but not for any long time, for He quickly
   rose again from the dead.

   34.  The Sun was darkened, because of the Sun of Righteousness [1633]
   .  Rocks were rent, because of the spiritual Rock.  Tombs were opened,
   and the dead arose, because of Him who was free among the dead [1634] ;
   He sent forth His prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water [1635]
   .  Be not then ashamed of the Crucified, but be thou also bold to say,
   He beareth our sins, and endureth grief for us, and with His stripes we
   are healed [1636] .  Let us not be unthankful to our Benefactor.  And
   again; for the transgression of my people was He led to death; and I
   will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His death [1637]
   .  Therefore Paul says plainly, that Christ died for our sins according
   to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He hath risen again
   the third day according to the Scriptures [1638] .

   35.  But we seek to know clearly where He has been buried.  Is His tomb
   made with hands?  Is it, like the tombs of kings, raised above the
   ground?  Is the Sepulchre made of stones joined together?  And what is
   laid upon it?  Tell us, O Prophets, the exact truth concerning His tomb
   also, where He is laid, and where we shall seek Him?  And they say,
   Look into the solid rock which ye have hewn [1639] .  Look in and
   behold.  Thou hast in the Gospels In a sepulchre hewn in stone, which
   was hewn out of a rock [1640] .  And what happens next?  What kind of
   door has the sepulchre?  Again another Prophet says, They cut off My
   life in a dungeon [1641] , and cast a stone upon Me.  I, who am the
   Chief corner-stone, the elect, the precious [1642] , lie for a little
   time within a stone--I who am a stone of stumbling to the Jews, and of
   salvation to them who believe.  The Tree of life [1643] , therefore was
   planted in the earth, that the earth which had been cursed might enjoy
   the blessing, and that the dead might be released.

   36.  Let us not then be ashamed to confess the Crucified.  Be the Cross
   our seal made with boldness by our fingers on our brow, and on
   everything; over the bread we eat, and the cups we drink; in our
   comings in, and goings out; before our sleep, when we lie down and when
   we rise up; when we are in the way, and when we are still [1644] .
   Great is that preservative; it is without price, for the sake of the
   poor; without toil, for the sick; since also its grace is from God.  It
   is the Sign of the faithful, and the dread of devils:  for He triumphed
   over them in it, having made a shew of them openly [1645] ; for when
   they see the Cross they are reminded of the Crucified; they are afraid
   of Him, who bruised the heads of the dragon [1646] .  Despise not the
   Seal, because of the freeness of the gift; out for this the rather
   honour thy Benefactor.

   37.  And if thou ever fall into disputation and hast not the grounds of
   proof, yet let Faith remain firm in thee; or rather, become thou well
   learned, and then silence the Jews out of the prophets, and the Greeks
   out of their own fables.  They themselves worship men who have been
   thunderstricken [1647] :  but the thunder when it comes from heaven,
   comes not at random.  If they are not ashamed to worship men
   thunderstricken and abhorred of God, art thou ashamed to worship the
   beloved Son of God, who was crucified for thee?  I am ashamed to tell
   the tales about their so-called Gods, and I leave them because of time;
   let those who know, speak.  And let all heretics also be silenced.  If
   any say that the Cross is an illusion, turn away from him.  Abhor those
   who say that Christ was crucified to our fancy [1648] only; for if so,
   and if salvation is from the Cross, then is salvation a fancy also.  If
   the Cross is fancy, the Resurrection is fancy also; but if Christ be
   not risen, we are yet in our sins [1649] .  If the Cross is fancy, the
   Ascension also is fancy; and if the Ascension is fancy, then is the
   second coming also fancy, and everything is henceforth unsubstantial.

   38.  Take therefore first, as an indestructible foundation, the Cross,
   and build upon it the other articles of the faith.  Deny not the
   Crucified; for, if thou deny Him, thou hast many to arraign thee.
   Judas the traitor will arraign thee first; for he who betrayed Him
   knows that He was condemned to death by the chief-priests and elders.
   The thirty pieces of silver bear witness; Gethsemane bears witness,
   where the betrayal occurred; I speak not yet of the Mount of Olives, on
   which they were with Him at night, praying.  The moon in the night
   bears witness; the day bears witness, and the sun which was darkened;
   for it endured not to look on the crime of the conspirators.  The fire
   will arraign thee, by which Peter stood and warmed himself; if thou
   deny the Cross, the eternal fire awaits thee.  I speak hard words, that
   thou may not experience hard pains.  Remember the swords that came
   against Him in Gethsemane, that thou feel not the eternal sword.  The
   house of Caiaphas [1650] will arraign thee, shewing by its present
   desolation the power of Him who was erewhile judged there.  Yea,
   Caiaphas himself will rise up against thee in the day of judgment, the
   very servant will rise up against thee, who smote Jesus with the palm
   of his hand; they also who bound Him, and they who led Him away.  Even
   Herod shall rise up against thee; and Pilate; as if saying, Why deniest
   thou Him who was slandered before us by the Jews, and whom we knew to
   have done no wrong?  For I Pilate then washed my hands.  The false
   witnesses shall rise up against thee, and the soldiers who arrayed Him
   in the purple robe, and set on Him the crown of thorns, and crucified
   Him in Golgotha, and cast lots for His coat.  Simon the Cyrenian will
   cry out upon thee, who bore the Cross after Jesus.

   39.  From among the stars there will cry out upon thee, the darkened
   Sun; among the things upon earth, the Wine mingled with myrrh; among
   reeds, the Reed; among herbs, the Hyssop; among the things of the sea,
   the Sponge; among trees, the Wood of the Cross;--the soldiers, too, as
   I have said, who nailed Him, and cast lots for His vesture; the soldier
   who pierced His side with the spear; the women who then were present;
   the veil of the temple then rent asunder; the hall of Pilate, now laid
   waste by the power of Him who was then crucified; this holy Golgotha,
   which stands high above us, and shews itself to this day, and displays
   even yet how because of Christ the rocks were then riven [1651] ; the
   sepulchre nigh at hand where He was laid; and the stone which was laid
   on the door, which lies to this day by the tomb; the Angels who were
   then present; the women who worshipped Him after His resurrection;
   Peter and John, who ran to the sepulchre; and Thomas, who thrust his
   hand into His side, and his fingers into the prints of the nails.  For
   it was for our sakes that he so carefully handled Him; and what thou,
   who wert not there present, wouldest have sought, he being present, by
   God's Providence, did seek.

   40.  Thou hast Twelve Apostles, witnesses of the Cross; and the whole
   earth, and the world of men who believe on Him who hung thereon.  Let
   thy very presence here now persuade thee of the power of the
   Crucified.  For who now brought thee to this assembly? what soldiers?
   With what bonds wast thou constrained?  What sentence held thee fast
   here now?  Nay, it was the Trophy of salvation, the Cross of Jesus that
   brought you all together.  It was this that enslaved the Persians, and
   tamed the Scythians; this that gave to the Egyptians, for cats and dogs
   and their manifold errors, the knowledge of God; this, that to this day
   heals diseases; that to this day drives away devils, and overthrows the
   juggleries of drugs and charms.

   41.  This shall appear again with Jesus from heaven [1652] ; for the
   trophy shall precede the king:  that seeing Him whom they pierced
   [1653] , and knowing by the Cross Him who was dishonoured, the Jews may
   repent and mourn; (but they shall mourn tribe by tribe [1654] , for
   they shall repent, when there shall be no more time for repentance;)
   and that we may glory, exulting in the Cross, worshipping the Lord who
   was sent, and crucified for us, and worshipping also God His Father who
   sent Him, with the Holy Ghost:  To whom be glory for ever and ever.
   Amen.

   [1571] Ibid.  R.V. Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof.  The
   word rendered fruit is literally bread.  The phrase is evidently
   proverbial.  The Hebrew word which means "destroy" is misinterpreted by
   embalomen in the Greek.  Hence arose the fanciful application of the
   passage to the cross laid on the body of Christ to be borne by Him.
   Justin M. (Tryph. lxxii.) charges the Jews with having recently cut out
   the passage because of the supposed reference to Christ.  Tertullian
   (adv. Judæos, c. 10) writes:  "Of course on His body that wood' was
   put; for so Christ has revealed, calling His body bread.'"  He gives
   the same interpretation elsewhere (adv. Marcion. III. 19; IV. 40).  Cf.

   concerning Baptism in water and the Spirit, and if one who has endured
   the Baptism of Martyrdom receives remission of sins, then with good

   eyes the place being ploughed and sown by strangers, and adds that in
   his own time the stones for both public and private buildings were
   taken from the ruins.  The Bordeaux Pilgrim (333 a.d.) says, "It is
   evident where the house of Caiaphas the Priest was; and there is still
   the pillar at which Christ was scourged:"  this pillar is described by
   Jerome (Ep. 86) as supporting the portico of the Church which by his

   Lecture XIV.

   On the Words, And Rose Again from the Dead on the Third Day, and
   Ascended into the Heavens, and Sat on the Right Hand of the Father.

   1 Cor. xv. 1-4

   Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached unto
   you....that He hath been raised on the third day according to the
   Scriptures, &c.

   Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and keep high festival, all ye that love Jesus;
   for He is risen.  Rejoice, all ye that mourned before [1655] , when ye
   heard of the daring and wicked deeds of the Jews:  for He who was
   spitefully entreated of them in this place is risen again.  And as the
   discourse concerning the Cross was a sorrowful one, so let the good
   tidings of the Resurrection bring joy to the hearers.  Let mourning be
   turned into gladness, and lamentation to joy:  and let our mouth be
   filled with joy and gladness, because of Him, who after His
   resurrection, said Rejoice [1656] .  For I know the sorrow of Christ's
   friends in these past days; because, as our discourse stopped short at
   the Death and the Burial, and did not tell the good tidings of the
   Resurrection, your mind was in suspense, to hear what you were longing
   for.

   Now, therefore, the Dead is risen, He who was free among the dead
   [1657] , and the deliverer of the dead.  He who in dishonour wore
   patiently the crown of thorns, even He arose, and crowned Himself with
   the diadem of His victory over death.

   2.  As then we set forth the testimonies concerning His Cross, so come
   let us now verify the proofs of His Resurrection also:  since the
   Apostle before us [1658] affirms, He was buried, and has been raised on
   the third day according to the Scriptures.  As an Apostle, therefore,
   has sent us back to the testimonies of the Scriptures, it is good that
   we should get full knowledge of the hope of our salvation; and that we
   should learn first whether the divine Scriptures tell us the season of
   His resurrection, whether it comes in summer or in autumn, or after
   winter; and from what kind of place the Saviour has risen, and what has
   been announced in the admirable Prophets as the name of the place of
   the Resurrection, and whether the women, who sought and found Him not,
   afterwards rejoice at finding Him; in order that when the Gospels are
   read, the narratives of these holy Scriptures may not be thought fables
   nor rhapsodies.

   3.  That the Saviour then was buried, ye have heard distinctly in the
   preceding discourse, as Isaiah saith, His burial shall be in peace
   [1659] :  for in His burial He made peace between heaven and earth,
   bringing sinners unto God:  and, that the righteous is taken out of the
   way of unrighteousness [1660] :  and, His burial shall be in peace:
   and, I will give the wicked for His burial [1661] .  There is also the
   prophecy of Jacob saying in the Scriptures, He lay down and couched as
   a lion, and as a lion's whelp:  who shall rouse Him up [1662] ?  And
   the similar passage in Numbers, He couched, He lay down as a lion, and
   as a lion's whelp [1663] .  The Psalm also ye have often heard, which
   says, And Thou hast brought me down into the dust of death [1664] .
   Moreover we took note of the spot, when we quoted the words, Look unto
   the rock, which ye have hewn [1665] .  But now let the testimonies
   concerning His resurrection itself go with us on our way.

   4.  First, then, in the 11th Psalm He says, For the misery of the poor,
   and the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord [1666]
   .  But this passage still remains doubtful with some:  for He often
   rises up also in anger [1667] , to take vengeance upon His enemies.

   Come then to the 15th Psalm, which says distinctly:  Preserve Me, O
   Lord, for in Thee have I put my trust [1668] :  and after this, their
   assemblies of blood will I not join, nor make mention of their names
   between my lips [1669] ; since they have refused me, and chosen Cæsar
   as their king [1670] :  and also the next words, I foresaw the Lord
   alway before Me, because He is at My right hand, that I may not be
   moved [1671] :  and soon after Yea and even until night my reins
   chastened me [1672] .  And after this He says most plainly, For Thou
   wilt not leave My soul in hell [1673] ; neither wilt Thou suffer Thine
   Holy One to see corruption.  He said not, neither wilt Thou suffer
   Thine Holy One to see death, since then He would not have died; but
   corruption, saith He, I see not, and shall not abide in death.  Thou
   hast made known to Me the ways of life [1674] .  Behold here is plainly
   preached a life after death.  Come also to the 29th Psalm, I will extol
   Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast lifted Me up, and hast not made My foes to
   rejoice over Me [1675] .  What is it that took place?  Wert thou
   rescued from enemies, or wert thou released when about to be smitten?
   He says himself most plainly, O Lord, Thou hast brought up My soul from
   hell [1676] .  There he says, Thou wilt not leave, prophetically:  and
   here he speaks of that which is to take place as having taken place,
   Thou hast brought up.  Thou hast saved Me from them that go down into
   the pit [1677] .  At what time shall the event occur?  Weeping shall
   continue for the evening, and joy cometh in the morning [1678] :  for
   in the evening was the sorrow of the disciplines, and in the morning
   the joy of the resurrection.

   5.  But wouldst thou know the place also?  Again He saith in Canticles,
   I went down into the garden of nuts [1679] ; for it was a garden where
   He was crucified [1680] .  For though it has now been most highly
   adorned with royal gifts, yet formerly it was a garden, and the signs
   and the remnants of this remain.  A garden enclosed, a fountain sealed
   [1681] , by the Jews who said, We remember that that deceiver said
   while He was yet alive, After three days, I will rise:  command,
   therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure; and further on, So they
   went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone with the guard
   [1682] .  And aiming well at these, one saith, and in rest Thou shalt
   judge them [1683] .  But who is the fountain that is sealed, or who is
   interpreted as being a well-spring of living water [1684] ?  It is the
   Saviour Himself, concerning whom it is written, For with Thee is the
   fountain of life [1685] .

   6.  But what says Zephaniah in the person of Christ to the disciples?
   Prepare thyself, be rising at the dawn:  all their gleaning is
   destroyed [1686] :  the gleaning, that is, of the Jews, with whom there
   is not a cluster, nay not even a gleaning of salvation left; for their
   vine is cut down.  See how He says to the disciples, Prepare thyself,
   rise up at dawn:  at dawn expect the Resurrection.

   And farther on in the same context of Scripture He says, Therefore wait
   thou for Me, saith the Lord, until the day of My Resurrection at the
   Testimony [1687] .  Thou seest that the Prophet foresaw the place also
   of the Resurrection, which was to be surnamed "the Testimony."  For
   what is the reason that this spot of Golgotha and of the Resurrection
   is not called, like the rest of the Churches, a Church, but a
   Testimony?  Why, perhaps, it was because of the Prophet, who had said,
   until the day of My Resurrection at the Testimony.

   7.  And who then is this, and what is the sign of Him that rises?  In
   the words of the Prophet that follow in the same context, He says
   plainly, For then will I turn to the peoples a language [1688] :
   since, after the Resurrection, when the Holy Ghost was sent forth the
   gift of tongues was granted, that they might serve the Lord under one
   yoke [1689] .  And what other token is set forth in the same Prophet,
   that they should serve the Lord under one yoke?  From beyond the rivers
   of Ethiopia they shall bring me offerings [1690] .  Thou knowest what
   is written in the Acts, when the Ethiopian eunuch came from beyond the
   rivers of Ethiopia [1691] .  When therefore the Scriptures tell both
   the time and the peculiarity of the place, when they tell also the
   signs which followed the Resurrection, have thou henceforward a firm
   faith in the Resurrection, and let no one stir thee from confessing
   Christ risen from the dead [1692] .

   8.  Now take also another testimony in the 87th Psalm, where Christ
   speaks in the Prophets, (for He who then spoke came afterwards among
   us):  O Lord, God of My salvation, I have cried day and night before
   Thee, and a little, farther on, I became as it were a man without help,
   free among the dead [1693] .  He said not, I became a man without help;
   but, as it were a man without help.  For indeed He was crucified not
   from weakness, but willingly and His Death was not from involuntary
   weakness.  I was counted with them that go down into the pit [1694] .
   And what is the token?  Thou hast put away Mine acquaintance far from
   Me [1695] (for the disciples have fled).  Wilt Thou shew wonders to the
   dead [1696] ?  Then a little while afterwards:  And unto Thee have I
   cried, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer come before Thee
   [1697] .  Seest thou how they shew the exact point of the Hour, and of
   the Passion and of the Resurrection?

   9.  And whence hath the Saviour risen?  He says in the Song of Songs:
   Rise up, come, My neighbour [1698] :  and in what follows, in a cave of
   the rock [1699] !  A cave of the rock He called the cave which was
   erewhile before the door of the Saviour's sepulchre, and had been hewn
   out of the rock itself, as is wont to be done here in front of the
   sepulchres.  For now it is not to be seen, since the outer cave was cut
   away at that time for the sake of the present adornment.  For before
   the decoration of the sepulchre by the royal munificence, there was a
   cave in the front of the rock [1700] .  But where is the rock that had
   in it the cave?  Does it lie near the middle of the city, or near the
   walls and the outskirts?  And whether is it within the ancient walls,
   or within the outer walls which were built afterwards?  He says then in
   the Canticles:  in a cave of the rock, close to the outer wall [1701] .

   10.  At what season does the Saviour rise?  Is it the season of summer,
   or some other?  In the same Canticles immediately before the words
   quoted He says, The winter is past, the rain is past and gone [1702] ;
   the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the pruning is come [1703]
   .  Is not then the earth full of flowers now, and are they not pruning
   the vines?  Thou seest how he said also that the winter is now past.
   For when this month Xanthicus [1704] is come, it is already spring.
   And this is the season, the first month with the Hebrews, in which
   occurs the festival of the Passover, the typical formerly, but now the
   true.  This is the season of the creation of the world:  for then God
   said, Let the earth bring forth herbage of grass, yielding seed after
   his kind and after his likeness [1705] .  And now, as thou seest,
   already every herb is yielding seed.  And as at that time God made the
   sun and moon and gave them courses of equal day (and night), so also a
   few days since was the season of the equinox.

   At that time God said, let us make man after our image and after our
   likeness [1706] .  And the image he received, but the likeness through
   his disobedience he obscured.  At the same season then in which he lost
   this the restoration also took place.  At the same season as the
   created man through disobedience was cast out of Paradise, he who
   believed was through obedience brought in.  Our Salvation then took
   place at the same season as the Fall:  when the flowers appeared, and
   the pruning was come.

   11.  A garden was the place of His Burial, and a vine that which was
   planted there:  and He hath said, I am the vine [1707] !  He was
   planted therefore in the earth in order that the curse which came
   because of Adam might be rooted out.  The earth was condemned to thorns
   and thistles:  the true Vine sprang up out of the earth, that the
   saying might be fulfilled, Truth sprang up out of the earth, and
   righteousness looked down from heaven [1708] .  And what will He that
   is buried in the garden say?  I have gathered My myrrh with My spices:
   and again, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices [1709] .  Now these
   are the symbols of the burying; and in the Gospels it is said, The
   women came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had
   prepared [1710] :  Nicodemus also bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes
   [1711] .  And farther on it is written, I did eat My bread with My
   honey [1712] :  the bitter before the Passion, and the sweet after the
   Resurrection.  Then after He had risen He entered through closed
   doors:  but they believed not that it was He:  for they supposed that
   they beheld a spirit [1713] .  But He said, Handle Me and see.  Put
   your fingers into the print of the nails, as Thomas required.  And
   while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them,
   Have ye here anything to eat?  And they gave Him a piece of a broiled
   fish and honeycomb [1714] .  Seest thou how that is fulfilled, I did
   eat My bread with My honey.

   12.  But before He entered through the closed doors, the Bridegroom and
   Suitor [1715] of souls was sought by those noble and brave women.  They
   came, those blessed ones, to the sepulchre, and sought Him Who had been
   raised, and the tears were still dropping from their eyes, when they
   ought rather to have been dancing with joy for Him that had risen.
   Mary came seeking Him, according to the Gospel, and found Him not:  and
   presently she heard from the Angels, and afterwards saw the Christ.
   Are then these things also written?  He says in the Song of Songs, On
   my bed I sought Him whom my soul loved.  At what season?  By night on
   my bed I sought Him Whom my soul loved:  Mary, it says, came while it
   was yet dark.  On my bed I sought Him by night, I sought Him, and I
   found Him not [1716] .  And in the Gospels Mary says, They have taken
   away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him [1717] .  But the
   Angels being then present cure their want of knowledge; for they said,
   Why seek ye the living among the dead [1718] ?  He not only rose, but
   had also the dead with Him when He rose [1719] .  But she knew not, and
   in her person the Song of Songs said to the Angels, Saw ye Him Whom my
   soul loved?  It was but a little that I passed from them (that is, from
   the two Angels), until I found Him Whom my soul loved.  I held Him, and
   would not let Him go [1720] .

   13.  For after the vision of the Angels, Jesus came as His own Herald;
   and the Gospel says, And behold Jesus met them, saying, All hail! and
   they came and took hold of His feet [1721] .  They took hold of Him,
   that it might be fulfilled, I will hold Him, and will not let Him go.
   Though the woman was weak in body, her spirit was manful.  Many waters
   quench not love, neither do rivers drown it [1722] ; He was dead whom
   they sought, yet was not the hope of the Resurrection quenched.  And
   the Angel says to them again, Fear not ye; I say not to the soldiers,
   fear not, but to you [1723] ; as for them, let them be afraid, that,
   taught by experience, they may bear witness and say, Truly this was the
   Son of God [1724] ; but you ought not to be afraid, for perfect love
   casteth out fear [1725] .  Go, tell His disciples that He is risen
   [1726] ; and the rest.  And they depart with joy, yet full of fear; is
   this also written? yes, the second Psalm, which relates the Passion of
   Christ, says, Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto Him with
   trembling [1727] ;--rejoice, because of the risen Lord; but with
   trembling, because of the earthquake, and the Angel who appeared as
   lightning.

   14.  Though, therefore, Chief Priests and Pharisees through Pilate's
   means sealed the tomb; yet the women beheld Him who was risen.  And
   Esaias knowing the feebleness of the Chief Priests, and the women's
   strength of faith, says, Ye women, who come from beholding, come hither
   [1728] ; for the people hath no understanding;--the Chief Priests want
   understanding, while women are eye-witnesses.  And when the soldiers
   came into the city to them, and told them all that had come to pass,
   they said to them, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole Him
   away while we slept [1729] ?  Well therefore did Esaias foretell this
   also, as in their persons, But tell us, and relate to us another deceit
   [1730] .  He who rose again, is up, and for a gift of money they
   persuade the soldiers; but they persuade not the kings of our time.
   The soldiers then surrendered the truth for silver; but the kings of
   this day have, in their piety, built this holy Church of the
   Resurrection of God our Saviour, inlaid with silver and wrought with
   gold, in which we are assembled [1731] ; and embellished it with the
   treasures of silver and gold and precious stones.  And if this come to
   the governor's ears, they say, we will persuade him [1732] .  Yea,
   though ye persuade the soldiers, yet ye will not persuade the world;
   for why, as Peter's guards were condemned when he escaped out of the
   prison, were not they also who watched Jesus Christ condemned?  Upon
   the former, sentence was pronounced by Herod, for they were ignorant
   and had nothing to say for themselves; while the latter, who had seen
   the truth, and concealed it for money, were protected by the Chief
   Priests.  Nevertheless, though but a few of the Jews were persuaded at
   the time, the world became obedient.  They who hid the truth were
   themselves hidden; but they who received it were made manifest by the
   power of the Saviour, who not only rose from the dead, but also raised
   the dead with Himself.  And in the person of these the Prophet Osee
   says plainly, After two days will He revive us, and in the third day we
   shall rise again, and shall live in His sight [1733] .

   15.  But since the disobedient Jews will not be persuaded by the Divine
   Scriptures, but forgetting all that is written gainsay the Resurrection
   of Jesus, it were good to answer them thus:  On what ground, while you
   say that Eliseus and Elias raised the dead, do you gainsay the
   Resurrection of our Saviour?  Is it that we have no living witnesses
   now out of that generation to what we say?  Well, do you also bring
   forward witnesses of the history of that time.  But that is
   written;--so is this also written:  why then do ye receive the one, and
   reject the other?  They were Hebrews who wrote that history; so were
   all the Apostles Hebrews:  why then do ye disbelieve the Jews [1734] ?
   Matthew who wrote the Gospel wrote it in the Hebrew tongue [1735] ; and
   Paul the preacher was a Hebrew of the Hebrews; and the twelve Apostles
   were all of Hebrew race:  then fifteen Bishops of Jerusalem were
   appointed in succession from among the Hebrews [1736] .  What then is
   your reason for allowing your own accounts, and rejecting ours, though
   these also are written by Hebrews from among yourselves.

   16.  But it is impossible, some one will say, that the dead should
   rise; and yet Eliseus twice raised the dead,--when he was alive, and
   also when dead.  Do we then believe, that when Eliseus was dead, a dead
   man who was cast upon him and touched him, arose and is Christ not
   risen?  But in that case, the dead man who touched Eliseus, arose, yet
   he who raised him continued nevertheless dead:  but in this case both
   the Dead of whom we speak Himself arose, and many dead were raised
   without having even touched Him.  For many bodies of the Saints which
   slept arose, and they came out of the graves after His Resurrection,
   and went into the Holy City [1737] , (evidently this city, in which we
   now are [1738] ,) and appeared unto many.  Eliseus then raised a dead
   man, but he conquered not the world; Elias raised a dead man, but
   devils are not driven away in the name of Elias.  We are not speaking
   evil of the Prophets, but we are celebrating their Master more highly;
   for we do not exalt our own wonders by disparaging theirs; for theirs
   also are ours; but by what happened among them, we win credence for our
   own.

   17.  But again they say, "A corpse then lately dead was raised by the
   living; but shew us that one three days dead can possibly arise, and
   that a man should be buried, and rise after three days."  If we seek
   for Scripture testimony in proof of such facts, the Lord Jesus Christ
   Himself supplies it in the Gospels, saying, For as Jonas was three days
   and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three
   days and three nights in the heart of the earth [1739] .  And when we
   examine the story of Jonas, great is the force [1740] of the
   resemblance.  Jesus was sent to preach repentance; Jonas also was
   sent:  but whereas the one fled, not knowing what should come to pass;
   the other came willingly, to give repentance unto salvation.  Jonas was
   asleep in the ship, and snoring amidst the stormy sea; while Jesus also
   slept, the sea, according to God's providence [1741] , began to rise,
   to shew in the sequel the might of Him who slept.  To the one they
   said, Why art thou snoring?  Arise, call upon thy God, that God may
   save us [1742] ; but in the other case they say unto the Master, Lord,
   save us [1743] .  Then they said, Call upon thy God; here they say,
   save Thou.  But the one says, Take me, and cast me into the sea; so
   shall the sea be calm unto you [1744] ; the other, Himself rebuked the
   winds and the sea, and there was a great calm [1745] .  The one was
   cast into a whale's belly:  but the other of His own accord went down
   thither, where the invisible whale of death is.  And He went down of
   His own accord, that death might cast up those whom he had devoured,
   according to that which is written, I will ransom them from the power
   of the grave; and from the hand of death I will redeem them [1746] .

   18.  At this point of our discourse, let us consider whether is harder,
   for a man after having been buried to rise again from the earth, or for
   a man in the belly of a whale, having come into the great heat of a
   living creature, to escape corruption.  For what man knows not, that
   the heat of the belly is so great, that even bones which have been
   swallowed moulder away?  How then did Jonas, who was three days and
   three nights in the whale's belly, escape corruption?  And, seeing that
   the nature of all men is such that we cannot live without breathing, as
   we do, in air, how did he live without a breath of this air for three
   days?  But the Jews make answer and say, The power of God descended
   with Jonas when he was tossed about in hell.  Does then the Lord grant
   life to His own servant, by sending His power with him, and can He not
   grant it to Himself as well?  If that is credible, this is credible
   also; if this is incredible, that also is incredible.  For to me both
   are alike worthy of credence.  I believe that Jonas was preserved, for
   all things are possible with God [1747] ; I believe that Christ also
   was raised from the dead; for I have many testimonies of this, both
   from the Divine Scriptures, and from the operative power even at this
   day [1748] of Him who arose,--who descended into hell alone, but
   ascended thence with a great company; for He went down to death, and
   many bodies of the saints which slept arose [1749] through Him.

   19.  Death was struck with dismay on beholding a new visitant descend
   into Hades, not bound by the chains of that place.  Wherefore, O
   porters of Hades, were ye scared at sight of Him?  What was the
   unwonted fear that possessed you?  Death fled, and his flight betrayed
   his cowardice.  The holy prophets ran unto Him, and Moses the Lawgiver,
   and Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; David also, and Samuel, and Esaias,
   and John the Baptist, who bore witness when he asked, Art Thou He that
   should come, or look we for another [1750] ?  All the Just were
   ransomed, whom death had swallowed; for it behoved the King whom they
   had proclaimed, to become the redeemer of His noble heralds.  Then each
   of the Just said, O death, where is thy victory?  O grave, where is thy
   sting [1751] ?  For the Conqueror hath redeemed us.

   20.  Of this our Saviour the Prophet Jonas formed the type, when he
   prayed out of the belly of the whale, and said, I cried in my
   affliction, and so on; out of the belly of hell [1752] , and yet he was
   in the whale; but though in the whale, he says that he is in Hades; for
   he was a type of Christ, who was to descend into Hades.  And after a
   few words, he says, in the person of Christ, prophesying most clearly,
   My head went down to the chasms of the mountains [1753] ; and yet he
   was in the belly of the whale.  What mountains then encompass thee?  I
   know, he says, that I am a type of Him, who is to be laid in the
   Sepulchre hewn out of the rock.  And though he was in the sea, Jonas
   says, I went down to the earth, since he was a type of Christ, who went
   down into the heart of the earth.  And foreseeing the deeds of the Jews
   who persuaded the soldiers to lie, and told them, Say that they stole
   Him away, he says, By regarding lying vanities they forsook their own
   mercy [1754] .  For He who had mercy on them came, and was crucified,
   and rose again, giving His own precious blood both for Jews and
   Gentiles; yet say they, Say that they stole Him away, having regard to
   lying vanities [1755] .  But concerning His Resurrection, Esaias also
   says, He who brought up from the earth the great Shepherd of the sheep
   [1756] ; he added the word, great, lest He should be thought on a level
   with the shepherds who had gone before Him.

   21.  Since then we have the prophecies, let faith abide with us.  Let
   them fall who fall through unbelief, since they so will; but thou hast
   taken thy stand on the rock of the faith in the Resurrection.  Let no
   heretic ever persuade thee to speak evil of the Resurrection.  For to
   this day the Manichees say, that, the resurrection of the Saviour was
   phantom-wise, and not real, not heeding Paul who says, Who was made of
   the seed of David according to the flesh; and again, By the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord from the dead [1757] .  And again
   he aims at them, and speaks thus, Say not in thine heart, who shall
   ascend into heaven; or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to
   bring up Christ from the dead [1758] ; and in like manner warning as he
   has elsewhere written again, Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead
   [1759] ; and again, And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching
   vain, and your faith also vain.  Yea, and we are found false witnesses
   of God; because we testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He
   raised not up [1760] .  But in what follows he says, But now is Christ
   risen from the dead, the first fruits of them that are asleep [1761]
   ;--And He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve; (for if thou believe
   not the one witness, thou hast twelve witnesses;) then He was seen of
   above five hundred brethren at once [1762] ; (if they disbelieve the
   twelve, let them admit the five hundred;) after that He was seen of
   James [1763] , His own brother, and first Bishop of this diocese.
   Seeing then that such a Bishop originally [1764] saw Christ Jesus when
   risen, do not thou, his disciple, disbelieve him.  But thou sayest that
   His brother James was a partial witness; afterwards He was seen also of
   me [1765] Paul, His enemy; and what testimony is doubted, when an enemy
   proclaims it?  "I, who was before a persecutor [1766] , now preach the
   glad tidings of the Resurrection."

   22.  Many witnesses there are of the Saviour's resurrection.--The
   night, and the light of the full moon; (for that night was the
   sixteenth [1767] ;) the rock of the sepulchre which received Him; the
   stone also shall rise up against the face of the Jews, for it saw the
   Lord; even the stone which was then rolled away [1768] , itself bears
   witness to the Resurrection, lying there to this day.  Angels of God
   who were present testified of the Resurrection of the Only-begotten:
   Peter and John, and Thomas, and all the rest of the Apostles; some of
   whom ran to the sepulchre, and saw the burial-clothes, in which He was
   wrapped before, lying there after the Resurrection; and others handled
   His hands and His feet, and beheld the prints of the nails; and all
   enjoyed together that Breath of the Saviour, and were counted worthy to
   forgive sins in the power of the Holy Ghost.  Women too were witnesses,
   who took hold of His feet, and who beheld the mighty earthquake, and
   the radiance of the Angel who stood by:  the linen clothes also which
   were wrapped about Him, and which He left when He rose;--the soldiers,
   and the money given to them; the spot itself also, yet to be seen;--and
   this house of the holy Church, which out of the loving affection to
   Christ of the Emperor Constantine of blessed memory, was both built and
   beautified as thou seest.

   23.  A witness to the resurrection of Jesus is Tabitha also, who was in
   His name raised from the dead [1769] ; for how shall we disbelieve that
   Christ is risen, when even His Name raised the dead?  The sea also
   bears witness to the resurrection of Jesus, as thou hast heard before
   [1770] .  The drought of fishes also testifies, and the fire of coals
   there, and the fish laid thereon.  Peter also bears witness, who had
   erst denied Him thrice, and who then thrice confessed Him; and was
   commanded to feed His spiritual [1771] sheep.  To this day stands Mount
   Olivet, still to the eyes of the faithful all but displaying Him Who
   ascended on a cloud, and the heavenly gate of His ascension.  For from
   heaven He descended to Bethlehem, but to heaven He ascended from the
   Mount of Olives [1772] ; at the former place beginning His conflicts
   among men, but in the latter, crowned after them.  Thou hast therefore
   many witnesses; thou hast this very place of the Resurrection; thou
   hast also the place of the Ascension towards the east; thou hast also
   for witnesses the Angels which there bore testimony; and the cloud on
   which He went up, and the disciples who came down from that place.

   24.  The course of instruction in the Faith would lead me to speak of
   the Ascension also; but the grace of God so ordered [1773] it, that
   thou heardest most fully concerning it, as far as our weakness allowed,
   yesterday, on the Lord's day; since, by the providence of divine grace,
   the course of the Lessons [1774] in Church included the account of our
   Saviour's going up into the heavens [1775] ; and what was then said was
   spoken principally for the sake of all, and for the assembled body of
   the faithful, yet especially for thy sake [1776] .  But the question
   is, didst thou attend to what was said?  For thou knowest that the
   words which come next in the Creed teach thee to believe in Him "Who
   rose again the third day, and ascended into Heaven, and sat down on the
   right hand of the Father."  I suppose then certainly that thou
   rememberest the exposition; yet I will now again cursorily put thee in
   mind of what was then said.  Remember what is distinctly written in the
   Psalms, God is gone up with a shout [1777] ; remember that the divine
   powers also said to one another, Lift up your gates, ye Princes [1778]
   , and the rest; remember also the Psalm which says, He ascended on
   high, He led captivity captive [1779] ; remember the Prophet who said,
   Who buildeth His ascension unto heaven [1780] ; and all the other
   particulars mentioned yesterday because of the gainsaying of the Jews.

   25.  For when they speak against the ascension of the Saviour, as being
   impossible, remember the account of the carrying away of Habakkuk:  for
   if Habakkuk was transported by an Angel, being carried by the hair of
   his head [1781] , much rather was the Lord of both Prophets and Angels,
   able by His own power to make His ascent into the Heavens on a cloud
   from the Mount of Olives.  Wonders like this thou mayest call to mind,
   but reserve the preeminence for the Lord, the Worker of wonders; for
   the others were borne up, but He bears up all things.  Remember that
   Enoch was translated [1782] ; but Jesus ascended:  remember what was
   said yesterday concerning Elias, that Elias was taken up in a chariot
   of fire [1783] ; but that the chariots of Christ are ten thousand-fold
   even thousands upon thousands [1784] :  and that Elias was taken up,
   towards the east of Jordan; but that Christ ascended at the east of the
   brook Cedron:  and that Elias went as into heaven [1785] ; but Jesus,
   into heaven:  and that Elias said that a double portion in the Holy
   Spirit should be given to his holy disciple; but that Christ granted to
   His own disciples so great enjoyment of the grace of the Holy Ghost, as
   not only to have It in themselves, but also, by the laying on of their
   hands, to impart the fellowship of It to them who believed.

   26.  And when thou hast thus wrestled against the Jews,--when thou hast
   worsted them by parallel instances, then come further to the
   pre-eminence of the Saviour's glory; namely, that they were the
   servants, but He the Son of God.  And thus thou wilt be reminded of His
   pre-eminence, by the thought that a servant of Christ was caught up to
   the third heaven.  For if Elias attained as far as the first heaven,
   but Paul as far as the third, the latter, therefore, has obtained a
   more honourable dignity.  Be not ashamed of thine Apostles; they are
   not inferior to Moses, nor second to the Prophets; but they are noble
   among the noble, yea, nobler still.  For Elias truly was taken up into
   heaven; but Peter has the keys of the kingdom of heaven, having
   received the words, Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
   loosed in heaven [1786] .  Elias was taken up only to heaven; but Paul
   both into heaven, and into paradise [1787] (for it behoved the
   disciples of Jesus to receive more manifold grace), and heard
   unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man to utter.  But Paul
   came down again from above, not because he was unworthy to abide in the
   third heaven, but in order that after having enjoyed things above man's
   reach, and descended in honour, and having preached Christ, and died
   for His sake, he might receive also the crown of martyrdom.  But I pass
   over the other parts of this argument, of which I spoke yesterday in
   the Lord's-day congregation; for with understanding hearers, a mere
   reminder is sufficient for instruction.

   27.  But remember also what I have often said [1788] concerning the
   Son's sitting at the right hand of the Father; because of the next
   sentence in the Creed, which says, "and ascended into Heaven, and sat
   down at the right hand of the Father."  Let us not curiously pry into
   what is properly meant by the throne; for it is incomprehensible:  but
   neither let us endure those who falsely say, that it was after His
   Cross and Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, that the Son began to
   sit on the right hand of the Father.  For the Son gained not His throne
   by advancement [1789] ; but throughout His being (and His being is by
   an eternal generation [1790] ) He also sitteth together with the
   Father.  And this throne the Prophet Esaias having beheld before the
   incarnate coming of the Saviour, says, I saw the Lord sitting on a
   throne, high and lifted up [1791] , and the rest.  For the Father no
   man hath seen at any time [1792] , and He who then appeared to the
   Prophet was the Son.  The Psalmist also says, Thy throne is prepared of
   old; Thou art from everlasting [1793] .  Though then the testimonies on
   this point are many, yet because of the lateness of the time, we will
   content ourselves even with these.

   28.  But now I must remind you of a few things out of many which are
   spoken concerning the Son's sitting at the right hand of the Father.
   For the hundred and ninth Psalm says plainly, The Lord said unto my
   Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
   footstool [1794] .  And the Saviour, confirming this saying in the
   Gospels, says that David spoke not these things of himself, but from
   the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, saying, How then doth David in the
   Spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on
   My right hand [1795] ? and the rest.  And in the Acts of the Apostles,
   Peter on the day of Pentecost standing with the Eleven [1796] , and
   discoursing to the Israelites, has in very words cited this testimony
   from the hundred and ninth Psalm.

   29.  But I must remind you also of a few other testimonies in like
   manner concerning the Son's sitting at the right hand of the Father.
   For in the Gospel according to Matthew it is written, Nevertheless, I
   say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the
   right hand of power [1797] , and the rest:  in accordance with which
   the Apostle Peter also writes, By the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, who
   is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven [1798] .  And the
   Apostle Paul, writing to the Romans, says, It is Christ that died, yea
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God
   [1799] .  And charging the Ephesians, he thus speaks, According to the
   working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised
   Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand [1800] ; and the
   rest.  And the Colossians he taught thus, If ye then be risen with
   Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand
   of God [1801] .  And in the Epistle to the Hebrews he says, When He had
   made purification of our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the
   Majesty on high [1802] .  And again, But unto which of the Angels hath
   He said at any time, Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine
   enemies thy footstool [1803] ?  And again, But He, when He had offered
   one sacrifice for all men, for ever sat down on the right hand of God;
   from henceforth expecting till His enemies be made His footstool [1804]
   .  And again, Looking unto Jesus, the author and perfecter of our
   faith; Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the Cross,
   despising shame, and is set down on the right hand of the throne of God
   [1805] .

   30.  And though there are many other texts concerning the session of
   the Only-begotten on the right hand of God, yet these may suffice us at
   present; with a repetition of my remark, that it was not after His
   coming in the flesh [1806] that He obtained the dignity of this seat;
   no, for even before all ages, the Only-begotten Son of God, our Lord
   Jesus Christ, ever possesses the throne on the right hand of the
   Father.  Now may He Himself, the God of all, who is Father of the
   Christ, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who came down, and ascended, and
   sitteth together with the Father, watch over your souls; keep unshaken
   and unchanged your hope in Him who rose again; raise you together with
   Him from your dead sins unto His heavenly gift; count you worthy to be
   caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air [1807] , in His
   fitting time; and, until that time arrive of His glorious second
   advent, write all your names in the Book of the living, and having
   written them, never blot them out (for the names of many, who fall
   away, are blotted out); and may He grant to all of you to believe on
   Him who rose again, and to look for Him who is gone up, and is to come
   again, (to come, but not from the earth; for be on your guard, O man,
   because of the deceivers who are to come;) Who sitteth on high, and is
   here present together with us, beholding the order of each, and the
   steadfastness of his faith [1808] .  For think not that because He is
   now absent in the flesh, He is therefore absent also in the Spirit.  He
   is here present in the midst of us, listening to what is said of Him,
   and beholding thine inward thoughts, and trying the reins and hearts
   [1809] ;--who also is now ready to present those who are coming to
   baptism, and all of you, in the Holy Ghost to the Father, and to say,
   Behold, I and the children whom God hath given Me [1810] :--To whom be
   glory for ever.  Amen.

   [1706] Gen. i. 26.  "The ancient Church very accurately distinguished
   between eikon (image) and homoiosis (likeness), and the Greek Church
   does the same in its Confession.  The latter phrase expresses man's
   destination, which is not to be regarded as carried out at the moment
   of creation.  (Dorner, System of Christian Doctrine, E. Tr. II. p.
   78).  The image lies in the permanent capacities of man's nature (Gen.
   ix. 6; 1 Cor. xi. 7; Jas. iii. 9), the likeness in their realisation in
   moral conformity with God (homoetheian Theou, Ignatius, Magnes vi).
   "The image of God is a comprehensive thing....To this belongs man's
   intellective power, his liberty of will, his dominion over the other
   creatures flowing from the two former.  These make up the to ousiodes,
   that part of that divine image which is natural and essential to man,
   and consequently can never be wholly blotted out, defaced, or
   extinguished, but still remains even in man fallen.  But beside these
   the Church of God hath ever acknowledged, in the first man, certain
   additional ornaments, and as it were complements of the divine image,
   such as immortality, grace, holiness, righteousness, whereby man
   approached more nearly to the similitude and likeness of God.  These
   were (if I may so speak) the lively colours wherein the grace, the
   beauty, and lustre of the divine image principally consisted; these
   colours faded, yea, were defaced and blotted out by man's
   transgression.  (Bull, The State of Man before the Fall, Vol. ii. p.
   114, Ox.).  Cf. Iren. (V. vi. § 1; xvi. § 2); Tertullian (de Baptismo,
   c. 5); Clem. Alex. (Exhort. c. 12); Origen (c. Cels. IV. 30).

   igitur non creditis?"

   [1735] The statements of Papias, Irenæus, Origen, Eusebius, Epiphanius,
   and Jerome, concerning a Hebrew Gospel of S. Matthew are ably discussed
   by Dr. Salmon (Introduction to N.T. Lect. X.), who comes to the
   conclusion that the Canonical Gospel was not translated from Hebrew
   (Aramaic), but originally written in Greek.

   [1736] This statement may have been derived either from Eusebius (Hist.
   Eccl.. IV. c. 5), or from the "written records" (engraphon), from which
   he had learned that "until the siege of the Jews which took place under
   Adrian (135 a.d.), there were fifteen bishops in succession there, all
   of whom are said to have been of Hebrew descent."  See the list of

   reading, ek tes ges instead of ek tes thalasses is found in the
   Alexandrine ms. of the Septuagint.  Athanasius (Ad Serapion, Ep. i. 12)
   has the same reading and interpretation as Cyril.  By "the shepherds"
   are probably meant Moses and Aaron:  cf. Ps. lxxvii. 20:  Who leddest
   Thy people like sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron. Heb. xiii. 20:
   Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,

   the hour in which he had drunk the Cup of the Lord, until he should see
   Him rising from the dead.  Wherefore the Saviour immediately after He
   had risen appeared to James and commanded him to eat.

   [1772] St. Luke (xxiv. 50) describes the Ascension as taking place at
   Bethany, but the tradition, which Cyril follows, had long since fixed
   the scene on the summit of the Mount of Olives, a mile nearer to
   Jerusalem; and here the Empress Helena had built the Church of the
   Ascension (Eusebius, Life of Constantine, III. 43; Demonstr. Evang. VI.
   xviii. 26).  There is nothing in Cyril's language to warrant the
   Benedictine Editor's suggestion that he alludes to the legend,
   according to which the marks of Christ's feet were indelibly impressed
   on the spot from which He ascended.  In the next generation St.
   Augustine seems to countenance the miraculous story (In Joh. Evang.
   Tract xlvii.):  "There are His footsteps, now adored, where last He
   stood, and whence He ascended into heaven."  The supposed trace of one
   foot is still shewn on Mount Olivet; "the other having been removed by
   the Turks is now to be found in the Chapel of S. Thecla, which is in
   the Patriarch's Palace" (Jerusalem Ed.).  Compare Stanley, Sinai and
   Palestine, c. xiv.; Dictionary of Bible, Olives Mount of.

   [1775] The section Luke xxiv. 36-53, which in the Eastern Church is the
   Gospel for Ascension Day, is also one of the "eleven morning Gospels of
   the Resurrection (euangelia anastasima heothina), which were read in
   turn, one every Sunday at Matins."  Dictionary of Chr. Antiq.

   intended exaltation of Elijah into heaven, and therefore hos is rightly
   used (Kühner, Gramm. § 604, note; Jelf, § 626, Obs. 1), while here the
   thing is referred to as an accomplished historical fact."  The
   distinction here drawn by Cyril is therefore hypercritical, as is seen
   below in § 26, where he writes, 'Elias men gar anelephthe eis ouranon.

   Lecture XV.

   On the Clause, And Shall Come in Glory to Judge the Quick and the Dead;
   Of Whose Kingdom There Shall Be No End.

   Daniel vii. 9-14

   I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did
   sit, and then, I saw in a vision of the night, and behold one like unto
   the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, &c.

   1.  We preach not one advent only of Christ, but a second also, far
   more glorious than the former.  For the former gave a view of His
   patience; but the latter brings with it the crown of a divine kingdom.
   For all things, for the most part, are twofold in our Lord Jesus
   Christ:  a twofold generation; one, of God, before the ages; and one,
   of a Virgin, at the close of the ages:  His descents twofold; one, the
   unobserved, like rain on a fleece [1811] ; and a second His open
   coming, which is to be.  In His former advent, He was wrapped in
   swaddling clothes in the manger; in His second, He covereth Himself
   with light as with a garment [1812] .  In His first coming, He endured
   the Cross, despising shame [1813] ; in His second, He comes attended by
   a host of Angels, receiving glory [1814] .  We rest not then upon His
   first advent only, but look also for His second.  And as at His first
   coming we said, Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord
   [1815] , so will we repeat the same at His second coming; that when
   with Angels we meet our Master, we may worship Him and say, Blessed is
   He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.  The Saviour comes, not to be
   judged again, but to judge them who judged Him; He who before held His
   peace when judged [1816] , shall remind the transgressors who did those
   daring deeds at the Cross, and shall say, These things hast thou done,
   and I kept silence [1817] .  Then, He came because of a divine
   dispensation, teaching men with persuasion; but this time they will of
   necessity have Him for their King, even though they wish it not.

   2. And concerning these two comings, Malachi the Prophet says, And the
   Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple [1818] ; behold one
   coming.  And again of the second coming he says, And the Messenger of
   the covenant whom ye delight in.  Behold, He cometh, saith [1819] the
   Lord Almighty.  But who shall abide the day of His coming? or who shall
   stand when He appeareth?  Because He cometh in like a refiner's fire,
   and like fullers' herb; and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier.
   And immediately after the Saviour Himself says, And I will draw near to
   you in judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers,
   and against the adulteresses, and against those who swear falsely in My
   Name [1820] , and the rest.  For this cause Paul warning us beforehand
   says, If any man buildeth on the foundation gold, and silver, and
   precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made
   manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in
   fire [1821] .  Paul also knew these two comings, when writing to Titus
   and saying, The grace of God hath appeared which bringeth salvation
   unto all men, instructing us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
   lusts, we should live soberly, and godly, and righteously in this
   present world; looking for the blessed hope, and appearing of the glory
   of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ [1822] .  Thou seest how
   he spoke of a first, for which he gives thanks; and of a second, to
   which we look forward.  Therefore the words also of the Faith which we
   are announcing were just now delivered thus [1823] ; that we believe in
   Him, who also ascended into the heavens, and sat down on the right hand
   of the Father, and shall come in glory to judge quick and dead; whose
   kingdom shall have no end.

   3.  Our Lord Jesus Christ, then, comes from heaven; and He comes with
   glory at the end of this world, in the last day.  For of this world
   there is to be an end, and this created world is to be re-made anew
   [1824] .  For since corruption, and theft, and adultery, and every sort
   of sins have been poured forth over the earth, and blood has been
   mingled with blood [1825] in the world, therefore, that this wondrous
   dwelling-place may not remain filled with iniquity, this world passeth
   away, that the fairer world may be made manifest.  And wouldest thou
   receive the proof of this out of the words of Scripture?  Listen to
   Esaias, saying, And the heaven shall be rolled together as a scroll;
   and all the stars shall fall, as leaves from a vine, and as leaves fall
   from a fig-tree [1826] .  The Gospel also says, The sun shall be
   darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
   fall from heaven [1827] .  Let us not sorrow, as if we alone died; the
   stars also shall die; but perhaps rise again.  And the Lord rolleth up
   the heavens, not that He may destroy them, but that He may raise them
   up again more beautiful.  Hear David the Prophet saying, Thou, Lord, in
   the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens
   are the work of Thy hands; they shall perish, but Thou remainest [1828]
   .  But some one will say, Behold, he says plainly that they shall
   perish.  Hear in what sense he says, they shall perish; it is plain
   from what follows; And they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as
   a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be changed.  For as a
   man is said to "perish," according to that which is written, Behold,
   how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart [1829] , and
   this, though the resurrection is looked for; so we look for a
   resurrection, as it were, of the heavens also.  The sun shall be turned
   into darkness, and the moon into blood [1830] .  Here let converts from
   the Manichees gain instruction, and no longer make those lights their
   gods; nor impiously think, that this sun which shall be darkened is
   Christ [1831] .  And again hear the Lord saying, Heaven and earth shall
   pass away, but My words shall not pass away [1832] ; for the creatures
   are not as precious as the Master's words.

   4.  The things then which are seen shall pass away, and there shall
   come the things which are looked for, things fairer than the present;
   but as to the time let no one be curious.  For it is not for you, He
   says, to know times or seasons, which the Father hath put in His own
   power [1833] .  And venture not thou to declare when these things shall
   be, nor on the other hand supinely slumber.  For he saith, Watch, for
   in such an hour as ye expect not the Son of Man cometh [1834] .  But
   since it was needful for us to know the signs of the end, and since we
   are looking for Christ, therefore, that we may not die deceived and be
   led astray by that false Antichrist, the Apostles, moved by the divine
   will, address themselves by a providential arrangement to the True
   Teacher, and say, Tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall
   be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world [1835] ?  We
   look for Thee to come again, but Satan transforms himself into an Angel
   of light; put us therefore on our guard, that we may not worship
   another instead of Thee.  And He, opening His divine and blessed mouth,
   says, Take heed that no man mislead you.  Do you also, my hearers, as
   seeing Him now with the eyes of your mind, hear Him saying the same
   things to you; Take heed that no man mislead you.  And this word
   exhorts you all to give heed to what is spoken; for it is not a history
   of things gone by, but a prophecy of things future, and which will
   surely come.  Not that we prophesy, for we are unworthy; but that the
   things which are written will be set before you, and the signs
   declared.  Observe thou, which of them have already come to pass, and
   which yet remain; and make thyself safe.

   5.  Take heed that no man mislead you:  for many shall come in My name,
   saying, I am Christ, and shall mislead many.  This has happened in
   part:  for already Simon Magus has said this, and Menander [1836] , and
   some others of the godless leaders of heresy; and others will say it in
   our days, or after us.

   6.  A second sign.  And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars
   [1837] .  Is there then at this time war between Persians and Romans
   for Mesopotamia, or no?  Does nation rise up against nation and kingdom
   against kingdom, or no?  And there shall be famines and pestilences and
   earthquakes in divers places.  These things have already come to pass;
   and again, And fearful sights from heaven, and mighty storms [1838] .
   Watch therefore, He says; for ye know not at what hour your Lord doth
   come [1839] .

   7.  But we seek our own sign of His coming; we Churchmen seek a sign
   proper to the Church [1840] .  And the Saviour says, And then shall
   many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one
   another [1841] .  If thou hear that bishops advance against bishops,
   and clergy against clergy, and laity against laity even unto blood, be
   not troubled [1842] ; for it has been written before.  Heed not the
   things now happening, but the things which are written; and even though
   I who teach thee perish, thou shalt not also perish with me; nay, even
   a hearer may become better than his teacher, and he who came last may
   be first, since even those about the eleventh hour the Master
   receives.  If among Apostles there was found treason, dost thou wonder
   that hatred of brethren is found among bishops?  But the sign concerns
   not only rulers, but the people also; for He says, And because iniquity
   shall abound, the love of the many shall wax cold [1843] .  Will any
   then among those present boast that he entertains friendship unfeigned
   towards his neighbour?  Do not the lips often kiss, and the countenance
   smile, and the eyes brighten forsooth, while the heart is planning
   guile, and the man is plotting mischief with words of peace?

   8.  Thou hast this sign also:  And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be
   preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then
   shall the end come [1844] .  And as we see, nearly the whole world is
   now filled with the doctrine of Christ.

   9.  And what comes to pass after this?  He says next, When therefore ye
   see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the
   Prophet, standing in the Holy Place, let him that readeth understand
   [1845] .  And again, Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is
   the Christ, or, Lo, there; believe it not [1846] .  Hatred of the
   brethren makes room next for Antichrist; for the devil prepares
   beforehand the divisions among the people, that he who is to come may
   be acceptable to them.  But God forbid that any of Christ's servants
   here, or elsewhere, should run over to the enemy!  Writing concerning
   this matter, the Apostle Paul gave a manifest sign, saying, For that
   day shall not come, except there came first the falling away, and the
   man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth
   himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that
   he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
   Remember ye not that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
   And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be
   revealed in his own season.  For the mystery of iniquity doth already
   work, only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of
   the way.  And then shall the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord
   Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with
   the brightness of His coming.  Even him, whose coming is after the
   working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with
   all deceit of unrighteousness for them that are perishing [1847] .
   Thus wrote Paul, and now is the falling away.  For men have fallen away
   from the right faith [1848] ; and some preach the identity of the Son
   with the Father [1849] , and others dare to say that Christ was brought
   into being out of nothing [1850] .  And formerly the heretics were
   manifest; but now the Church is filled with heretics in disguise [1851]
   .  For men have fallen away from the truth, and have itching ears
   [1852] .  Is it a plausible discourse? all listen to it gladly.  Is it
   a word of correction? all turn away from it.  Most have departed from
   right words, and rather choose the evil, than desire the good [1853] .
   This therefore is the falling away, and the enemy is soon to be looked
   for:  and meanwhile he has in part begun to send forth his own
   forerunners [1854] , that he may then come prepared upon the prey.
   Look therefore to thyself, O man, and make safe thy soul.  The Church
   now charges thee before the Living God; she declares to thee the things
   concerning Antichrist before they arrive.  Whether they will happen in
   thy time we know not, or whether they will happen after thee we know
   not; but it is well that, knowing these things, thou shouldest make
   thyself secure beforehand.

   10.  The true Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God, comes no more from
   the earth.  If any come making false shows [1855] in the wilderness, go
   not forth; if they say, Lo, here is the Christ, Lo, there, believe it
   not [1856] .  Look no longer downwards and to the earth; for the Lord
   descends from heaven; not alone as before, but with many, escorted by
   tens of thousands of Angels; nor secretly as the dew on the fleece
   [1857] ; but shining forth openly as the lightning.  For He hath said
   Himself, As the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto
   the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be [1858] ; and
   again, And they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds with
   power and great glory, and He shall send forth His Angels with a great
   trumpet [1859] ; and the rest.

   11.  But as, when formerly He was to take man's nature, and God was
   expected to be born of a Virgin, the devil created prejudice against
   this, by craftily preparing among idol-worshippers [1860] fables of
   false gods, begetting and begotten of women, that, the falsehood having
   come first, the truth, as he supposed, might be disbelieved; so now,
   since the true Christ is to come a second time, the adversary, taking
   occasion by [1861] the expectation of the simple, and especially of
   them of the circumcision, brings in a certain man who is a magician
   [1862] , and most expert in sorceries and enchantments of beguiling
   craftiness; who shall seize for himself the power of the Roman empire,
   and shall falsely style himself Christ; by this name of Christ
   deceiving the Jews, who are looking for the Anointed [1863] , and
   seducing those of the Gentiles by his magical illusions.

   12.  But this aforesaid Antichrist is to come when the times of the
   Roman empire shall have been fulfilled, and the end of the world is now
   drawing near [1864] .  There shall rise up together ten kings of the
   Romans, reigning in different parts perhaps, but all about the same
   time; and after these an eleventh, the Antichrist, who by his magical
   craft shall seize upon the Roman power; and of the kings who reigned
   before him, three he shall humble [1865] , and the remaining seven he
   shall keep in subjection to himself.  At first indeed he will put on a
   show of mildness (as though he were a learned and discreet person), and
   of soberness and benevolence [1866] :  and by the lying signs and
   wonders of his magical deceit [1867] having beguiled the Jews, as
   though he were the expected Christ, he shall afterwards be
   characterized by all kinds of crimes of inhumanity and lawlessness, so
   as to outdo all unrighteous and ungodly men who have gone before him;
   displaying against all men, but especially against us Christians, a
   spirit murderous and most cruel, merciless and crafty [1868] .  And
   after perpetrating such things for three years and six months only, he
   shall be destroyed by the glorious second advent from heaven of the
   only-begotten Son of God, our Lord and Saviour Jesus, the true Christ,
   who shall slay Antichrist with the breath of His mouth [1869] , and
   shall deliver him over to the fire of hell.

   13.  Now these things we teach, not of our own invention, but having
   learned them out of the divine Scriptures used in the Church [1870] ,
   and chiefly from the prophecy of Daniel just now read; as Gabriel also
   the Archangel interpreted it, speaking thus:  The fourth beast shall be
   a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall surpass all kingdoms [1871] .
   And that this kingdom is that of the Romans, has been the tradition of
   the Church's interpreters.  For as the first kingdom which became
   renowned was that of the Assyrians, and the second, that of the Medes
   and Persians together, and after these, that of the Macedonians was the
   third, so the fourth kingdom now is that of the Romans [1872] .  Then
   Gabriel goes on to interpret, saying, His ten horns are ten kings that
   shall arise; and another king shall rise up after them, who shall
   surpass in wickedness all who were before him [1873] ; (he says, not
   only the ten, but also all who have been before him;) and he shall
   subdue three kings; manifestly out of the ten former kings:  but it is
   plain that by subduing three of these ten, he will become the eighth
   king; and he shall speak words against the Most High [1874] .  A
   blasphemer the man is and lawless, not having received the kingdom from
   his fathers, but having usurped the power by means of sorcery.

   14.  And who is this, and from what sort of working?  Interpret to us,
   O Paul.  Whose coming, he says, is after the working of Satan, with all
   power and signs and lying wonders [1875] ; implying, that Satan has
   used him as an instrument, working in his own person through him; for
   knowing that his judgment shall now no longer have respite, he wages
   war no more by his ministers, as is his wont, but henceforth by himself
   more openly [1876] .  And with all signs and lying wonders; for the
   father of falsehood will make a show [1877] of the works of falsehood,
   that the multitudes may think that they see a dead man raised, who is
   not raised, and lame men walking, and blind men seeing, when the cure
   has not been wrought.

   15.  And again he says, Who opposeth and exalteth himself against all
   that is called God, or that is worshipped; (against every God;
   Antichrist forsooth will abhor the idols,) so that he seateth himself
   in the temple of God [1878] .  What temple then?  He means, the Temple
   of the Jews which has been destroyed.  For God forbid that it should be
   the one in which we are!  Why say we this?  That we may not be supposed
   to favour ourselves.  For if he comes to the Jews as Christ, and
   desires to be worshipped by the Jews, he will make great account of the
   Temple, that he may more completely beguile them; making it supposed
   that he is the man of the race of David, who shall build up the Temple
   which was erected by Solomon [1879] .  And Antichrist will come at the
   time when there shall not be left one stone upon another in the Temple
   of the Jews, according to the doom pronounced by our Saviour [1880] ;
   for when, either decay of time, or demolition ensuing on pretence of
   new buildings, or from any other causes, shall have overthrown all the
   stones, I mean not merely of the outer circuit, but of the inner shrine
   also, where the Cherubim were, then shall he come with all signs and
   lying wonders, exalting himself against all idols; at first indeed
   making a pretence of benevolence, but afterwards displaying his
   relentless temper, and that chiefly against the Saints of God.  For he
   says, I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints [1881] ; and
   again elsewhere, there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was
   since there was a nation upon earth, even to that same time [1882] .
   Dreadful is that beast, a mighty dragon, unconquerable by man, ready to
   devour; concerning whom though we have more things to speak out of the
   divine Scriptures, yet we will content ourselves at present with thus
   much, in order to keep within compass.

   16.  For this cause the Lord knowing the greatness of the adversary
   grants indulgence to the godly, saying, Then let them which be in Judæa
   flee to the mountains [1883] .  But if any man is conscious that he is
   very stout-hearted, to encounter Satan, let him stand (for I do not
   despair of the Church's nerves), and let him say, Who shall separate us
   from the love of Christ and the rest [1884] ?  But, let those of us who
   are fearful provide for our own safety; and those who are of a good
   courage, stand fast: for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath
   not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall
   be [1885] .  But thanks be to God who hath confined the greatness of
   that tribulation to a few days; for He says, But for the elect's sake
   those days shall be shortened [1886] ; and Antichrist shall reign for
   three years and a half only.  We speak not from apocryphal books, but
   from Daniel; for he says, And they shall be given into his hand until a
   time and times and half a time [1887] .  A time is the one year in
   which his coming shall for a while have increase; and the times are the
   remaining two years of iniquity, making up the sum of the three years;
   and the half a time is the six months.  And again in another place
   Daniel says the same thing, And he sware by Him that liveth for ever
   that it shall be for a time, and times, and half a time [1888] .  And
   some peradventure have referred what follows also to this; namely, a
   thousand two hundred and ninety days [1889] ; and this, Blessed is he
   that endureth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and
   thirty days [1890] .  For this cause we must hide ourselves and flee;
   for perhaps we shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the
   Son of Man be come [1891] .

   17.  Who then is the blessed man, that shall at that time devoutly
   witness for Christ?  For I say that the Martyrs of that time excel all
   martyrs.  For the Martyrs hitherto have wrestled with men only; but in
   the time of Antichrist they shall do battle with Satan in his own
   person [1892] .  And former persecuting kings only put to death; they
   did not pretend to raise the dead, nor did they make false shows [1893]
   of signs and wonders.  But in his time there shall be the evil
   inducement both of fear and of deceit, so that if it be possible the
   very elect shall be deceived [1894] .  Let it never enter into the
   heart of any then alive to ask, "What did Christ more?  For by what
   power does this man work these things?  Were it not God's will, He
   would not have allowed them."  The Apostle warns thee, and says
   beforehand, And for this cause God shall send them a working of error;
   (send, that is, shall allow to happen;) not that they might make
   excuse, but that they might be condemned [1895] .  Wherefore?  They, he
   says, who believed not the truth, that is, the true Christ, but had
   pleasure in unrighteousness, that is, in Antichrist.  But as in the
   persecutions which happen from time to time, so also then God will
   permit these things, not because He wants power to hinder them, but
   because according to His wont He will through patience crown His own
   champions like as He did His Prophets and Apostles; to the end that
   having toiled for a little while they may inherit the eternal kingdom
   of heaven, according to that which Daniel says, And at that time thy
   people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the
   book (manifestly, the book of life); and many of them that sleep in the
   dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and same to
   shame and everlasting contempt; and they that be wise shall shine as
   the brightness of the firmament; and of the many righteous [1896] , as
   the stars for ever and ever.

   18.  Guard thyself then, O man; thou hast the signs of Antichrist; and
   remember them not only thyself, but impart them also freely to all.  If
   thou hast a child according to the flesh, admonish him of this now; if
   thou hast begotten one through catechizing [1897] , put him also on his
   guard, lest he receive the false one as the True.  For the mystery of
   iniquity doth already work [1898] .  I fear these wars of the nations
   [1899] ; I fear the schisms of the Churches; I fear the mutual hatred
   of the brethren.  But enough on this subject; only God forbid that it
   should be fulfilled in our days; nevertheless, let us be on our guard.
   And thus much concerning Antichrist.

   19.  But let us wait and look for the Lord's coming upon the clouds
   from heaven.  Then shall Angelic trumpets sound; the dead in Christ
   shall rise first [1900] ,--the godly persons who are alive shall be
   caught up in the clouds, receiving as the reward of their labours more
   than human honour, inasmuch as theirs was a more than human strife;
   according as the Apostle Paul writes, saying, For the Lord Himself
   shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
   Archangel, and with the trump of God:  and the dead in Christ shall
   rise first.  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord [1901] .

   20.  This coming of the Lord, and the end of the world, were known to
   the Preacher; who says, Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and the
   rest [1902] ; Therefore remove anger [1903] from thy heart, and put
   away evil from thy flesh;...and remember thy Creator...or ever the evil
   days come [1904] ,....or ever the sun, and the light, and the moon, and
   the stars be darkened [1905] ,....and they that look out of the windows
   be darkened [1906] ; (signifying the faculty of sight;) or ever the
   silver cord be loosed; (meaning the assemblage of the stars, for their
   appearance is like silver;) and the flower of gold be broken [1907] ;
   (thus veiling the mention of the golden sun; for the camomile is a
   well-known plant, having many ray-like leaves shooting out round it;)
   and they shall rise up at the voice of the sparrow, yea, they shall
   look away from the height, and terrors shall be in the way [1908] .
   What shall they see?  Then shall they see the Son of man coming on the
   clouds of heaven; and they shall mourn tribe by tribe [1909] .  And
   what shall come to pass when the Lord is come?  The almond tree shall
   blossom, and the grasshopper shall grow heavy, and the caper-berry
   shall be scattered abroad [1910] .  And as the interpreters say, the
   blossoming almond signifies the departure of winter; and our bodies
   shall then after the winter blossom with a heavenly flower [1911] .
   And the grasshopper shall grow in substance (that means the winged soul
   clothing itself with the body [1912] ,) and the caper-berry shall be
   scattered abroad (that is, the transgressors who are like thorns shall
   be scattered [1913] ).

   21.  Thou seest how they all foretell the coming of the Lord.  Thou
   seest how they know the voice of the sparrow.  Let us know what sort of
   voice this is.  For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a
   shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God
   [1914] .  The Archangel shall make proclamation and say to all, Arise
   to meet the Lord [1915] .  And fearful will be that descent of our
   Master.  David says, God shall manifestly come, even our God, and shall
   not keep silence; a fire shall burn before Him, and a fierce tempest
   round about Him, and the rest [1916] .  The Son of Man shall come to
   the Father, according to the Scripture which was just now read, on the
   clouds of heaven, drawn by a stream of fire [1917] , which is to make
   trial of men.  Then if any man's works are of gold, he shall be made
   brighter; if any man's course of life be like stubble, and
   unsubstantial, it shall be burnt up by the fire [1918] .  And the
   Father shall sit, having His garment white as snow, and the hair of His
   head like pure wool [1919] .  But this is spoken after the manner of
   men; wherefore?  Because He is the King of those who have not been
   defiled with sins; for, He says, I will make your sins white as snow,
   and as wool [1920] , which is an emblem of forgiveness of sins, or of
   sinlessness itself.  But the Lord who shall come from heaven on the
   clouds, is He who ascended on the clouds; for He Himself hath said, And
   they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with
   power and great glory [1921] .

   22.  But what is the sign of His coming? lest a hostile power dare to
   counterfeit it.  And then shall appear, He says, the sign of the Son of
   Man in heaven [1922] .  Now Christ's own true sign is the Cross; a sign
   of a luminous Cross shall go before the King [1923] , plainly declaring
   Him who was formerly crucified:  that the Jews who before pierced Him
   and plotted against Him, when they see it, may mourn tribe by tribe
   [1924] , saying, "This is He who was buffeted, this is He whose face
   they spat on, this is He whom they bound with chains, this is He whom
   of old they crucified, and set at nought [1925] .  Whither, they will
   say, shall we flee from the face of Thy wrath?"  But the Angel hosts
   shall encompass them, so that they shall not be able to flee anywhere.
   The sign of the Cross shall be a terror to His foes; but joy to His
   friends who have believed in Him, or preached Him, or suffered for His
   sake.  Who then is the happy man, who shall then be found a friend of
   Christ?  That King, so great and glorious, attended by the
   Angel-guards, the partner of the Father's throne, will not despise His
   own servants.  For that His Elect may not be confused with His foes, He
   shall send forth His Angels with a great trumpet, and they shall gather
   together His elect from the four winds [1926] .  He despised not Lot,
   who was but one; how then shall He despise many righteous?  Come, ye
   blessed of My Father [1927] , will He say to them who shall then ride
   on chariots of clouds, and be assembled by Angels.

   23.  But some one present will say, "I am a poor man," or again, "I
   shall perhaps be found at that time sick in bed;" or, "I am but a
   woman, and I shall be taken at the mill:  shall we then be despised?"
   Be of good courage, O man; the Judge is no respecter of persons; He
   will not judge according to a man's appearance, nor reprove according
   to his speech [1928] .  He honours not the learned before the simple,
   nor the rich before the needy.  Though thou be in the field, the Angels
   shall take thee; think not that He will take the landowners, and leave
   thee the husbandman.  Though thou be a slave, though thou be poor, be
   not any whit distressed; He who took the form of a servant [1929]
   despises not servants.  Though thou be lying sick in bed, yet it is
   written, Then shall two be in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the
   other left [1930] .  Though thou be of compulsion put to grind, whether
   thou be man or woman [1931] ; though thou be in fetters [1932] , and
   sit beside the mill, yet He who by His might bringeth out them that are
   bound [1933] , will not overlook thee.  He who brought forth Joseph out
   of slavery and prison to a kingdom, shall redeem thee also from thy
   afflictions into the kingdom of heaven.  Only be of good cheer, only
   work, only strive earnestly; for nothing shall be lost.  Every prayer
   of thine, every Psalm thou singest is recorded; every alms-deed, every
   fast is recorded; every marriage duly observed is recorded; continence
   [1934] kept for God's sake is recorded; but the first crowns in the
   records are those of virginity and purity; and thou shalt shine as an
   Angel.  But as thou hast gladly listened to the good things, so listen
   again without shrinking to the contrary.  Every covetous deed of thine
   is recorded; thine every act of fornication is recorded, thine every
   false oath is recorded, every blasphemy, and sorcery, and theft, and
   murder.  All these things are henceforth to be recorded, if thou do the
   same now after having been baptized; for thy former deeds are blotted
   out.

   24.  When the Son of Man, He says, shall come in His glory, and all the
   Angels with Him [1935] .  Behold, O man, before what multitudes thou
   shalt come to judgment.  Every race of mankind will then be present.
   Reckon, therefore, how many are the Roman nation; reckon how many the
   barbarian tribes now living, and how many have died within the last
   hundred years; reckon how many nations have been buried during the last
   thousand years; reckon all from Adam to this day.  Great indeed is the
   multitude; but yet it is little, for the Angels are many more.  They
   are the ninety and nine sheep, but mankind is the single one [1936] .
   For according to the extent of universal space, must we reckon the
   number of its inhabitants.  The whole earth is but as a point in the
   midst of the one heaven, and yet contains so great a multitude; what a
   multitude must the heaven which encircles it contain?  And must not the
   heaven of heavens contain unimaginable numbers [1937] ?  And it is
   written, Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times
   ten thousand stood before Him [1938] ; not that the multitude is only
   so great, but because the Prophet could not express more than these.
   So there will be present at the judgment in that day, God, the Father
   of all, Jesus Christ being seated with Him, and the Holy Ghost present
   with Them; and an angel's trumpet shall summon us all to bring our
   deeds with us.  Ought we not then from this time forth to be sore
   troubled?  Think it not a slight doom, O man, even apart from
   punishment, to be condemned in the presence of so many.  Shall we not
   choose rather to die many deaths, than be condemned by friends?

   25.  Let us dread then, brethren, lest God condemn us; who needs not
   examination or proofs, to condemn.  Say not, In the night I committed
   fornication, or wrought sorcery, or did any other thing, and there was
   no man by.  Out of thine own conscience shalt thou be judged, thy
   thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing, in the day when God
   shall judge the secrets of men [1939] .  The terrible countenance of
   the Judge will force thee to speak the truth; or rather, even though
   thou speak not, it will convict thee.  For thou shalt rise clothed with
   thine own sins, or else with thy righteous deeds.  And this has the
   Judge Himself declared--for it is Christ who judges--for neither doth
   the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son
   [1940] , not divesting Himself of His power, but judging through the
   Son; the Son therefore judgeth by the will [1941] of the Father; for
   the wills of the Father and of the Son are not different, but one and
   the same.  What then says the Judge, as to whether thou shalt bear thy
   works, or no?  And before Him shall they gather all nations [1942] :
   (for in the presence of Christ every knee must bow, of things in
   heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth [1943] :)  and
   He shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd divideth his
   sheep from the goats.  How does the shepherd make the separation?  Does
   he examine out of a book which is a sheep and which a goat? or does he
   distinguish by their evident marks?  Does not the wool show the sheep,
   and the hairy and rough skin the goat?  In like manner, if thou hast
   been just now cleansed from thy sins, thy deeds shall be henceforth as
   pure wool; and thy robe shall remain unstained, and thou shalt ever
   say, I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on [1944] ?  By thy
   vesture shalt thou be known for a sheep.  But if thou be found hairy,
   like Esau, who was rough with hair, and wicked in mind, who for food
   lost his birthright and sold his privilege, thou shalt be one of those
   on the left hand.  But God forbid that any here present should be cast
   out from grace, or for evil deeds be found among the ranks of the
   sinners on the left hand!

   26.  Terrible in good truth is the judgment, and terrible the things
   announced.  The kingdom of heaven is set before us, and everlasting
   fire is prepared.  How then, some one will say, are we to escape the
   fire?  And how to enter into the kingdom?  I was an hungered, He says,
   and ye gave Me meat.  Learn hence the way; there is here no need of
   allegory, but to fulfil what is said.  I was an hungered, and ye gave
   Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye
   took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me; I was sick, and ye visited Me; I
   was in prison, and ye came unto Me [1945] .  These things if thou do,
   thou shalt reign together with Him; but if thou do them not, thou shalt
   be condemned.  At once then begin to do these works, and abide in the
   faith; lest, like the foolish virgins, tarrying to buy oil, thou be
   shut out.  Be not confident because thou merely possessest the lamp,
   but constantly keep it burning.  Let the light of thy good works shine
   before men [1946] , and let not Christ be blasphemed on thy account.
   Wear thou a garment of incorruption [1947] , resplendent in good works;
   and whatever matter thou receivest from God to administer as a steward,
   administer profitably.  Hast thou been put in trust with riches?
   Dispense them well.  Hast thou been entrusted with the word of
   teaching?  Be a good steward thereof.  Canst thou attach the souls of
   the hearers [1948] ?  Do this diligently.  There are many doors of good
   stewardship.  Only let none of us be condemned and cast out; that we
   may with boldness meet Christ the Everlasting King, who reigns for
   ever.  For He doth reign for ever, who shall be judge of quick and
   dead, because for quick and dead He died.  And as Paul says, For to
   this end Christ both died and lived again, that He might be Lord both
   of the dead and living [1949] .

   27.  And shouldest thou ever hear any say that the kingdom of Christ
   shall have an end, abhor the heresy; it is another head of the dragon,
   lately sprung up in .  A certain one has dared to affirm, that after
   the end of the world Christ shall reign no longer [1950] ; he has also
   dared to say, that the Word having come forth from the Father shall be
   again absorbed into the Father, and shall be no more [1951] ; uttering
   such blasphemies to his own perdition.  For he has not listened to the
   Lord, saying, The Son abideth for ever [1952] .  He has not listened to
   Gabriel, saying, And He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever,
   and of His kingdom there shall be no end [1953] .  Consider this text.
   Heretics of this day teach in disparagement of Christ, while Gabriel
   the Archangel taught the eternal abiding of the Saviour; whom then wilt
   thou rather believe? wilt thou not rather give credence to Gabriel?
   Listen to the testimony of Daniel in the text [1954] ; I saw in a
   vision of the night, and behold, one like the Son of Man came with the
   clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days.....And to Him was
   given the honour, and the dominion, and the kingdom:  and all peoples,
   tribes, and languages shall serve Him; His dominion is an everlasting
   dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be
   destroyed [1955] .  These things rather hold fast, these things
   believe, and cast away from thee the words of heresy; for thou hast
   heard most plainly of the endless kingdom of Christ.

   28.  The like doctrine thou has also in the interpretation of the
   Stone, which was cut out of a mountain without hands, which is Christ
   according to the flesh [1956] ; And His kingdom shall not be left to
   another people.  David also says in one place, Thy throne, O God, is
   for ever and ever [1957] ; and in another place, Thou, Lord, in the
   beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth, &c., they shall
   perish, but Thou remainest, &c.; but Thou art the same, and Thy years
   shall not fail [1958] :  words which Paul has interpreted of the Son
   [1959] .

   29.  And wouldest thou know how they who teach the contrary ran into
   such madness?  They read wrongly that good word of the Apostle, For He
   must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet [1960] ; and
   they say, when His enemies shall have been put under His feet, He shall
   cease to reign, wrongly and foolishly alleging this.  For He who is
   king before He has subdued His enemies, how shall He not the rather be
   king, after He has gotten the mastery over them.

   30.  They have also dared to say that the Scripture, When all things
   shall be subjected unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be
   subjected unto Him that subjected all things unto Him [1961] ,--that
   this Scripture shews that the Son also shall be absorbed into the
   Father.  Shall ye then, O most impious of all men, ye the creatures of
   Christ, continue? and shall Christ perish, by whom both you and all
   things were made?  Such a word is blasphemous.  But further, how shall
   all things be made subject unto Him?  By perishing, or by abiding?
   Shall then the other things, when subject to the Son abide, and shall
   the Son, when subject to the Father, not abide?  For He shall be
   subjected, not because He shall then begin to do the Father's will (for
   from eternity He doth always those things that please Him [1962] ), but
   because, then as before, He obeys the Father, yielding, not a forced
   obedience, but a self-chosen accordance; for He is not a servant, that
   He should be subjected by force, but a Son, that He should comply of
   His free choice and natural love.

   31.  But let us examine them; what is the meaning of "until" or "as
   long as?"  For with the very phrase will I close with them, and try to
   overthrow their error.  Since they have dared to say that the words,
   till He hath put His enemies under His feet, shew that He Himself shall
   have an end, and have presumed to set bounds to the eternal kingdom of
   Christ, and to bring to an end, as far as words go, His never-ending
   sovereignty, come then, let us read the like expressions in the
   Apostle:  Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam till Moses [1963] .
   Did men then die up to that time, and did none die any more after
   Moses, or after the Law has there been no more death among men?  Well
   then, thou seest that the word "unto" is not to limit time; but that
   Paul rather signified this,--"And yet, though Moses was a righteous and
   wonderful man, nevertheless the doom of death, which was uttered
   against Adam, reached even unto him, and them that came after him; and
   this, though they had not committed the like sins as Adam, by his
   disobedience in eating of the tree."

   32.  Take again another similar text.  For until this day...when Moses
   is read, a vail lieth upon their heart [1964] .  Does until this day
   mean only "until Paul?"  Is it not until this day present, and even to
   the end?  And if Paul say to the Corinthians, For we came even as far
   as unto you in preaching the Gospel of Christ, having hope when your
   faith increases to preach the Gospel in the regions beyond you [1965] ,
   thou seest manifestly that as far as implies not the end, but has
   something following it.  In what sense then shouldest thou remember
   that Scripture, till He hath put all enemies under His feet [1966] ?
   According as Paul says in another place, And exhort each other daily,
   while it is called to-day [1967] ; meaning, "continually."  For as we
   may not speak of the "beginning of the days" of Christ, so neither
   suffer thou that any should ever speak of the end of His kingdom.  For
   it is written, His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom [1968] .

   33.  And though I have many more testimonies out of the divine
   Scriptures, concerning the kingdom of Christ which has no end for ever,
   I will be content at present with those above mentioned, because the
   day is far spent.  But thou, O hearer, worship only Him as thy King,
   and flee all heretical error.  And if the grace of God permit us, the
   remaining Articles also of the Faith shall be in good time declared to
   you.  And may the God of the whole world keep you all in safety,
   bearing in mind the signs of the end, and remaining unsubdued by
   Antichrist.  Thou hast received the tokens of the Deceiver who is to
   come; thou hast received the proofs of the true Christ, who shall
   openly come down from heaven.  Flee therefore the one, the False one;
   and look for the other, the True.  Thou hast learnt the way, how in the
   judgment thou mayest be found among those on the right hand; guard that
   which is committed to thee [1969] concerning Christ, and be conspicuous
   in good works, that thou mayest stand with a good confidence before the
   Judge, and inherit the kingdom of heaven:--Through whom, and with whom,
   be glory to God with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever.  Amen.

   [1823] nun paredothe.  Cyril means that at the beginning of this
   present Lecture he had delivered to the Catechumens those articles of
   the Creed which he was going to explain.  Compare Cat. xviii. 21, where
   we see that Cyril first announces (epangello) the words which the
   learners repeat after him (apangello). The clause, Whose Kingdom shall
   have no end, was not contained in the original form of the Creed of
   Nicæa, a.d. 325, but its substance is found in many earlier writings.
   Compare Justin M. (Tryph. § 46:  kai autou estin he aionios basileia);
   Const. Apost. vii. 41; the Eusebian Confessions 1st and 4th Antioch,
   and the Macrostich, a.d. 341, 342, 344.  Bp. Bull asserts that the
   Creed of Jerusalem, containing this clause, was no other than the
   ancient Eastern Creed, first directed against the Gnostics of the
   Sub-Apostolic age (Judicium Eccl. Cathol. vi. 16).

   [1824] The Benedictine Editor suggests that Cyril "is refuting those
   who said that the Universe was to perish utterly, an opinion which
   seems to be somehow imputed to Origen by Methodius, or Proclus, in
   Epiphanius (Hæres. lxiv. 31, 32)."  On Origen's much controverted

   [1837] Matt. xxiv. 6.  The war with Sapor II., King of Persia, which
   broke out immediately on the death of Constantine, and continued
   throughout the reign of Constantius, was raging fiercely at the date of
   these Lectures, the great battle of Singara being fought in the year
   348 a.d.

   [1838] Luke xxi. 11.  Jerome in the Chronicon mentions a great
   earthquake in 346 a.d., by which Dyrrachium was destroyed, and Rome and
   other cities of Italy greatly injured (Ben. Ed.). Cyril substitutes
   cheimones for semeia, the better reading in Luke xxi. 11.

   [1839] Matt. xxiv. 42.

   [1840] hekklesiastikos, when applied to persons, means either, as here,
   an orthodox member of the Church in contrast to a heretic, pagan, or
   Jew (Origen, in Job xx. 6), or more particularly a Cleric as opposed to
   a layman (Cat. xvii. 10).

   [1841] Matt. xxiv. 10.

   [1842] "S. Cyril here describes the state of the Church, when orthodoxy
   was for a while trodden under foot, its maintainers persecuted, and the
   varieties of Arianism, which took its place, were quarreling for the
   ascendancy.  Gibbon quotes two passages, one from a pagan historian of
   the day, another from a Father of the Church, which fully bear out S.
   Cyril's words.  What made the state of things still more deplorable,
   was the defection of some of the orthodox party, as Marcellus, into
   opposite errors:  while the subsequent secessions of Apollinaris and
   Lucifer show what lurking disorders there were within it at the time
   when S. Cyril wrote.  (Vid. infr. 9.)  The passages referred to are as
   follows:  The Christian Religion,' says Ammianus, in itself plain and
   simple, he (Constantius) confounded by the dotage of superstition.
   Instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority, he
   cherished and propagated, by vain disputes, the differences which his
   vain curiosity had excited.  The highways were covered with troops of
   Bishops, galloping from every side to the assemblies, which they called
   synods; and while they laboured to reduce the whole sect to their own
   particular opinions, the public establishment of the posts was almost
   ruined by their hasty and repeated journeys.'  Hist. xxi. 16.  S.
   Hilary of Poictiers thus speaks of Asia Minor, the chief seat of the
   Arian troubles:  It is a thing equally deplorable and dangerous, that
   there are as many creeds as opinions among men, as many doctrines as
   inclinations, and as many sources of blasphemy as there are faults
   among us; because we make creeds arbitrarily, and explain them as
   arbitrarily.  The Homoousion is rejected and received and explained
   away by successive synods.  The partial or total resemblance of the
   Father and of the Son is a subject of dispute for these unhappy
   divines.  Every year, nay, every moon, we make new creeds to describe
   invisible mysteries.  We repent of what we have done, we defend those
   who repent, we anathematize those whom we defended.  We condemn either
   the doctrine of others in ourselves, or our own in that of others; and
   reciprocally tearing one another to pieces, we have been the cause of
   each other's ruin,' ad Constant. ii. 4, 5.  Gibbon's translations are
   used, which, though diffuse, are faithful in their matter.  What a
   contrast do these descriptions present to Athanasius' uniform
   declaration, that the whole question was really settled at Nicæa, and
   no other synod or debate was necessary!"--(R.W.C.).  Compare, for
   example, the account of the seditions in Antioch and in Constantinople,
   in Socrates, Eccles. Hist. i. 24; i., 12-14, and Athanas. Hist.
   Arianorum, passim.

   [1848] The prediction was supposed by earlier Fathers to refer to a
   personal Antichrist whom they expected to come speedily.  See Justin M.
   (Tryph. § 110:  ho tes apostasias anthropos; ib. § 32:  "He who is to
   speak blasphemous and daring things against the Most High is already at
   the doors."  Iren. Hær. V. 25.  Cyril in this passage regards the
   heresies of his time as the apostasy in general, but looks also for a
   personal Antichrist:  (§§ 11, 12).

   [1849] huiopatoria .  On this contemptuous name for Sabellianism, see
   Cat. iv. 8; xi. 16.  The Third (Eusebian) Confession, or Third of
   Antioch, a.d. 341, anathematizes any who hold the doctrines of
   Marcellus of Ancyra or Sabellius, or Paul of Samosata (Athan. de
   Synodis, § 24 note 10, p. 462, in this Series, and Mr. Robertson's
   Prolegomena, p. xliv.).  In the Ecthesis, or Statement of Faith, § 2,
   Athanasius writes:  "Neither do we hold a Son-Father, as do the
   Sabellians, calling Him of one but (a sole and?) not the same essence,
   and thus destroying the existence of the Son."  As to Marcellus, see
   Athanasius, Hist. Arian. § 6 (p. 271), and the letter of Julius in the
   Apologia c. Arian. § 32 (p. 116):  also notes 3, 4 on § 27 below.

   [1850] See Athanasius, De Synod. § 15:  "Arius and those with him
   thought and professed thus:  God made the Son out of nothing, and
   called Him His Son:'"  and Expos. Fidei, § 2:  "We do not regard as a
   creature, or thing made, or as made out of nothing, God the Creator of
   all, the Son of God, the true Being from the true Being, the Alone from
   the Alone, inasmuch as the like glory and power was eternally and
   conjointly begotten of the Father."  The 4th (Eusebian) Confession, or
   4th of Antioch, a.d. 342, ends thus:  "Those who say that the Son was
   from nothing,....the Catholic Church regards as aliens."

   [1851] Athan. Adversus Arianos, Or. i. 1:  "One heresy and that the
   last which has now risen as forerunner of Antichrist, the Arian as it
   is called, considering that other heresies, her elder sisters, have
   been openly proscribed, in her craft and cunning affects to array
   herself in Scripture language, like her father the devil, and is
   forcing her way back into the Church's paradise, &c."  The supposed
   date of this Oration is 8 or 10 years later than that of Cyril's
   Lectures.

   [1852] 2 Tim. iv. 3.

   [1853] A reading supported by the best mss. and approved by the
   Benedictine Editor gives a different sense, "and rather choose to seem
   than resolve to be," inverting the proverb "esse quam videri."

   [1854] In the passage quoted above in note 5 the Arian heresy is called
   a "forerunner" (prodromos) of Antichrist.

   [1855] phantasiokopon, a rare word, rendered "frantic" in Ecclus. iv.
   30:  its more precise meaning seems to be "making a false show," which
   is here applied to a false Christ, and again in § 14 to the father of
   lies who makes a vain show of false miracles.

   [1856] Matt. xxiv. 23.

   [1857] Ps. lxxii. 6.  Cf. § 1, note 1.

   [1858] Matt. xxiv. 27.

   [1859] Matt. xxiv. v. 30.

   [1860] en eidololatreia may mean either "in idol-worship," or "among
   idolaters," the abstract being used for the concrete, as in Rom. iii.
   30:  dikaiosei peritomen.

   [1861] ephodion, "provision for a journey," is here equivalent in
   meaning to aphorme, "a starting point," or "favourable occasion."

   [1862] Antichrist is described by Hippolytus (De Christo et
   Antichristo, § 57, as "a son of the devil, and a vessel of Satan," who
   will rule and govern "after the manner of the law of Augustus, by whom
   the Roman empire was established, sanctioning everything thereby."  Cf.
   Iren. Hær. V. 30, § 3; Dictionary of Christian Biography, Antichrist:
   "The sharp precision with which St. Paul had pointed to the man of
   sin,' the lawless one,' the adversary,' the son of perdition,' led men
   to dwell on that thought rather than on the many pseudochristoi of whom
   Christ Himself had spoken."

   [1863] ton 'Eleimuenon, Aquila's rendering of chysm, adopted by the
   Jews in preference to ton Christon, from hatred of the name Christ or
   Christian.  Hippolytus, ubi supra, § 6:  "The Saviour came into the
   world in the Circumcision, and he (Antichrist) will come in the same
   manner:"  ib. § 14:  "As Christ springs from the tribe of Judah, so
   Antichrist is to spring from the tribe of Dan."  This expectation was
   grounded by Hippolytus on Gen. xlix. 17.

   [1864] The fourth kingdom in the prophecy of Daniel (vii. 7, 23) was
   generally understood by early Christian writers to be the Roman Empire;
   and its dissolution was to be speedily followed by the end of the
   world.  See § 13 below; Irenæus, V. 26; and Hippolytus, ubi supra, §§
   19, 28.

   [1865] Dan. vii. 24:  and he shall put down three kings (R.V.).

   [1866] The Jerusalem Editor quotes as from Hippolytus a similar
   description of Antichrist (§ 23):  "In his first steps he will be
   gentle, loveable, quiet, pious, pacific, hating injustice, detesting
   gifts, not allowing idolatry, &c."  But the treatise is a forgery of
   unknown date, apparently much later than Cyril.

   [1867] Iren. V. 28, § 2:  "Since the demons and apostate spirits are at
   his service, he through their means performs wonders, by which he leads
   the inhabitants of the earth astray."

   [1868] Iren. V. 25, § 4:  "He shall remove his kingdom into that city
   (Jerusalem), and shall sit in the Temple of God, leading astray those
   who worship him as if he were Christ." According to the genuine
   treatise of Hippolytus Antichrist was to restore the kingdom of the
   Jews (De Antichristo, § 25), to collect the Jews out of every country
   of the Dispersion, making them his own, as though they were his own
   children, and promising to restore their country, and establish again
   their kingdom and nation, in order that he may be worshipped by them as
   God (§ 54), and he will lead them on to persecute the saints, i.e. the
   Christians (§ 56).  Compare the elaborate description of Antichrist and
   his cruelty in Lactantius, Div. Inst. vii. 17; Epit. § 71.

   [1869] 2 Thess ii. 8.  Cf. Iren. V. 25, § 3:  Hippol. § 64.

   [1870] ekklesiazomenon.  Cf. Cat. iv. 35, 36, where Cyril distinguishes
   the Scriptures has kai en 'Ekklesia meta parresias anaginoskomen from
   hosa en 'Ekklesiais me anaginosketai.

   [1871] Dan. vii. 23:  (R.V.) shall be diverse from all the kingdoms.

   [1872] Irenæus (V. 26) identifies the fourth kingdom with "the empire
   which now rules."  Hippolytus, de Antichristo, § 25:  "A fourth beast
   dreadful and terrible:  it had iron teeth and claws of brass.  And who
   are these but the Romans?"

   [1873] Dan. vii. 24.

   [1874] Dan. v. 25.  Dean Church compares Rev. xvii. 11:  And the beast
   that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and
   goeth into perdition.  See also Iren. V. 26, § 1.

   [1875] 2 Thess. ii. 9.  Lactantius (a.d. 300 circ.), Div. Inst. vii.
   17:  "that king....will also be a prophet of lies; and he will
   constitute and call himself God, and will order himself to be
   worshipped as the Son of God; and power will be given him to do signs
   and wonders, by the sight of which he may entice men to adore him."
   Cf. Epitome, lxxi.

   [1876] "Vid. Iren. Hær V. 26, 2" (R.W.C.).  The passage is quoted by
   Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. iv. 18), from a lost work of Justin M. Against
   Marcion:  "Justin well said that before the coming of the Lord Satan
   never dared to blaspheme God, as not yet knowing his own condemnation,
   because it was started by the prophets in parables and allegories.  But
   after our Lord's advent having learnt plainly from His words and those
   of the Apostles that everlasting fire is prepared for him,....he by
   means of such men as these blasphemes the Lord who brings the judgment
   upon him, as being already condemned." S. Cyril seems to expect that
   Antichrist will be an incarnation of Satan, as did Hippolytus (de
   Antichr. § 6):  "The Saviour appeared in the form of man, and he too
   will come in the form of a man."

   [1877] phantasiokopei.  See above, § 10, note 9, and the equivalent
   phrase in § 17:  semeion kai teraton phantasias edeiknuon.

   [1878] 2 Thess. ii. 4.

   [1879] See § 12, notes 3, 4, and Hippolytus, ubi supra:  "The Saviour
   raised up and shewed His holy flesh like a temple; and he will raise a
   temple of stone in Jerusalem."  "Cyril wrote this before Julian's
   attempt to rebuild the Jewish Temple" (R.W.C.).

   [1880] Matt. xxiv. 2.  Cyril refers the whole prophecy to the time of
   Christ's second coming at the end of the world, not regarding the
   destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple by Titus as fulfilling any part
   of the prediction.

   [1881] Dan. vii. 21.  Here again Cyril follows Hippolytus, § 25:  "And
   under this (horn) was signified none other than Antichrist.

   [1882] Ib. xii. 1.

   [1883] Matt. xxiv. 16.

   [1884] Rom. viii. 35.

   [1885] Matt. xxiv. 21.

   [1886] Ib. v. 22.

   [1887] Dan. vii. 25.  By "apocryphal" books Cyril probably means all
   such as were not allowed to be read in the public service of the
   Church:  see Cat. iv. 33, note 3; and Bp. Westcott's note on the
   various meanings of the word apokruphos, Hist. of the Canon, P. III. c.
   1.  That the Apocalypse of St. John is included under this term by
   Cyril, appears probable from the following reasons suggested by the
   Benedictine Editor.  (1) It is not mentioned in the list of the
   Canonical Scriptures in iv. 36.  (2) The earlier writers whom Cyril
   follows in this Lecture, Irenæus, Hær. V., 26, § 1, and Hippolytus, De
   Antichristo, § 34, combine the testimony of the Apocalypse with that of
   Daniel.  The omission in Cyril therefore cannot have been accidental.

   [1889] Ib. v. 11.

   [1890] Ib. v. 12.

   [1891] Matt. x. 23.

   [1892] autoprosopos .  See above, § 14, note 2.  Some mss. read
   antiprosopos, "face to face," as in xii. 32, antiprosopos.

   [1893] See above, § 14, note 3.

   [1895] 2 Thess. ii. 11, 12:  (R.V.) That they all might be judged.
   Cyril has katakrithosi

   [1896] Dan. xii. 1, 2:  (R.V.) they that turn many to righteousness.
   Cyril follows the rendering of the Septuagint, apo ton dikaion ton
   pollon, which gives no proper construction.

   [1897] Compare 1 Cor. iv. 15:  I begat you through the gospel.  Clem.

   [1902] Eccles. xi. 9.  The Preacher's description of old age and death
   is interpreted by Cyril of the end of the world, as it had been a
   century before by Gregory Thaumaturgus, in his paraphrase of the book.

   [1903] Ib. v. 10:  (R.V.) sorrow.  Marg. Or, vexation, Or, provocation.

   [1906] Ib. v. 3.

   [1907] Ib. v. 6.  According to the usual interpretation death is here
   represented by the breaking of a chain and the lamp which hangs from
   it.  Cf. Delitzsch, and Speaker's Commentary, in loc. for other
   interpretations. to anthemion tou chrusiou (Sept.), by which Cyril
   understood camomile (anthemis), more probably meant a pattern of
   flowers embossed on the vessel of gold:  vid. Xenoph. Anab. V. 4, §
   32:  estigmenous anthemia, "damasked with flowers."

   [1908] Eccles. xii. 5.  Cyril means rightly that the aged shrink from a
   giddy height, and from imaginary dangers of the road.  For the voice of
   the sparrow, see below, § 21, note 4.

   [1909] Matt. xxiv. 30; Zech. xii. 12.

   Commentary).

   [1912] The step, once as active as a grasshopper, or locust, shall grow
   heavy and slow.  For other interpretations see Delitzsch.

   [1913] The caper-berry (kapparis) shall fail, i.e. no longer stimulate
   appetite.  But diaschedasthesetai (Sept. Cyril) means that the old man
   shall be like a caper-berry which when fully ripe bursts it husks and
   scatters its seeds:  so R.V. (Margin); The caper-berry shall burst.
   Greg. Thaumat. Metaphr. Eccles.  "The transgressors are cast out of the
   way, like a black and despicable caper-plant."

   [1914] 1 Thes. ii. 16.

   [1915] Compare the spurious Apocalypse of John:  "And at the voice of
   the bird every plant shall arise; that is, At the voice of the
   Archangel all the human race shall arise" (English Trs. Ante-Nic. Libr.
   p. 496).  According to the Talmud the meaning is, "Even a bird awakes
   him" (Delitzsch).

   [1923] Cat. xiii. 4.  In the letter to Constantius, three or four years
   later than this Lecture, Cyril treats the appearance at that time of a
   luminous Cross in the sky as a fulfilment of Matt. xxiv. 30:  but he
   there adds (Ep. ad Constantium, § 6) that our Lord's prediction "was
   both fulfilled at that present time, and shall again be fulfilled more
   largely."  On the opinion that "the sign of the Son of Man in heaven"
   should be the Cross, see Suicer, Thesaurus, Stauros.  It is not
   improbable that the earliest trace of this interpretation is found in
   The Teaching of the Apostles, § 16:  "Then shall appear the signs of
   the Truth:  the first the sign of a (cross) spreading out (ekpetaseos)
   in heaven."

   [1924] Zech. xii. 12.

   [1925] Cf. Barnab. Epist. c. vii.:  "For they shall see Him in that day
   wearing the long scarlet robes about His flesh, and shall say, Is not
   this He, whom once we crucified, and set at nought, and spat upon (al.
   and pierced, and mocked)?"

   [1932] The Jerusalem ms. (A) alone has the true reading pedas, which is
   confirmed by pepedemenous in the quotation following, instead of
   paidas, which is quite inappropriate, and evidently an itacism.

   [1933] Ex. xi. 5.

   [1934] 'Enkrateia.  "Id est viduitas" (Ben. Ed.).  This special
   reference of the word to widowhood is to some extent confirmed by 1
   Cor. vii. 9:  ei de ouk enkrateuontai, and is rendered highly probable
   by Cyril's separate mention of marriage and virginity.

   [1935] Matt. xxv. 31.

   [1936] Matt. xviii. 12; Luke xv. 4.  Ambrose, Expos. in Luc. VII. 210:

   others He hath countless flocks, whom He hath left upon the
   mountains."  Cf. Gregor, Nyss. Contra Eunom. Or. xii.

   [1937] There is much variation in the reading and punctuation of this
   passage.  I have followed the text adopted by the Jerusalem Editor with
   Codd. A. Roe. Casaub. and Grodecq, in preference to the Benedictine
   text, with which the Editor himself is dissatisfied.

   laver of regeneration, and the garment of incorruption, which is the
   true life."

   [1948] prostheinai.  Cf. Acts ii. 41:  prosetethesan .  According to
   some mss. the sentence would run thus:  "Hast thou been entrusted with
   the word of teaching?  Be a good steward of thy hearers' souls.  Hast
   thou power to rule (prostenai)?  Do this diligently."

   [1949] Rom. xiv. 9.

   [1950] Marcellus, Bishop of Ancyra, and his pupil Photinus, are
   anathematized in the Creed called Makrostichos as holding that Christ
   first became "Son of God when He took our flesh from the Virgin....For
   they will have it that then Christ began His Kingdom, and that it will
   have an end after the consummation of all and the judgment.  Such are
   the disciples of Marcellus and Scotinus of Galatian Ancyra, &c."  See
   Newman on Athanasius, de Synodis, § 26, (5), notes a and b.  Compare
   the description of Marcellus in the Letter of the Oriental Bishops who
   had withdrawn from the Council of Sardica to Philippopolis (a.d. 344).
   "There has arisen in our days a certain Marcellus of Galatia, the most
   execrable pest of all heretics, who with sacrilegious mind, and impious
   mouth, and wicked argument seeks to set bounds to the perpetual,
   eternal, and timeless kingdom of our Lord Christ, saying that He began
   to reign four hundred years since, and shall end at the dissolution of
   the present world" (Hilar. Pictav. Ex Opere Hist. Fragm. iii.).

   [1951] "The person meant by Cyril, though he withholds the name, is
   Marcellus of Ancyra; who having written a book against the Arian
   Sophist Asterius to explain the Apostle's statement concerning the
   subjection of the Son to the Father, was thought to be renewing the
   heresy of Paul of Samosata.  On this account he was reproved by the
   Bishops at the Council of Jerusalem, a.d. 335, for holding false
   opinions, and being ordered to recant his opinions promised to burn his
   book.  Afterwards he applied to Constantine, by whom he was remitted to
   the Council of Constantinople, a.d. 336, and deposed by the Bishops.
   As however he was acquitted by the Councils of Rome, a.d. 342, and of
   Sardica, a.d. 347, it became a matter of dispute whether he was really
   heretical....From the fragments of his books transcribed by Eusebius,
   you may possibly acquit him of the Sabellian heresy and the confusion
   of the Father and the Son, but certainly not of the heresy concerning
   the end of Christ's kingdom, and the abandonment by the Word of the
   human nature which He assumed for our sake; so express are his words
   recorded by Eusebius in the beginning of the 2nd Book Contra Marcellum,

   On the Article, And in One Holy Ghost, the Comforter, Which Spake in
   the Prophets.

   1 Corinthians xii. 1, 4

   Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
   ignorant....Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit,
   &c.

   1.  Spiritual in truth is the grace we need, in order to discourse
   concerning the Holy Spirit; not that we may speak what is worthy of
   Him, for this is impossible, but that by speaking the words of the
   divine Scriptures, we may run our course without danger.  For a truly
   fearful thing is written in the Gospels, where Christ has plainly said,
   Whosoever shall speak a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
   forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come
   [1970] .  And there is often fear, lest a man should receive this
   condemnation, through speaking what he ought not concerning Him, either
   from ignorance, or from supposed reverence.  The Judge of quick and
   dead, Jesus Christ, declared that he hath no forgiveness; if therefore
   any man offend, what hope has he?

   2.  It must therefore belong to Jesus Christ's grace itself to grant
   both to us to speak without deficiency, and to you to hear with
   discretion; for discretion is needful not to them only who speak, but
   also to them that hear, lest they hear one thing, and misconceive
   another in their mind.  Let us then speak concerning the Holy Ghost
   nothing but what is written; and whatsoever is not written, let us not
   busy ourselves about it.  The Holy Ghost Himself spoke the Scriptures;
   He has also spoken concerning Himself as much as He pleased, or as much
   as we could receive.  Let us therefore speak those things which He has
   said; for whatsoever He has not said, we dare not say.

   3.  There is One Only Holy Ghost, the Comforter; and as there is One
   God the Father, and no second Father;--and as there is One
   Only-begotten Son and Word of God, who hath no brother;--so is there
   One Only Holy Ghost, and no second spirit equal in-honour to Him.  Now
   the Holy Ghost is a Power most mighty, a Being divine and unsearchable;
   for He is living and intelligent, a sanctifying principle of all things
   made by God through Christ.  He it is who illuminates the souls of the
   just; He was in the Prophets, He was also in the Apostles in the New
   Testament.  Abhorred be they who dare to separate the operation of the
   Holy Ghost!  There is One God, the Father, Lord of the Old and of the
   New Testament:  and One Lord, Jesus Christ, who was prophesied of in
   the Old Testament, and came in the New; and One Holy Ghost, who through
   the Prophets preached of Christ, and when Christ was come, descended,
   and manifested Him [1971] .

   4.  Let no one therefore separate the Old from the New Testament [1972]
   ; let no one say that the Spirit in the former is one, and in the
   latter another; since thus he offends against the Holy Ghost Himself,
   who with the Father and the Son together is honoured, and at the time
   of Holy Baptism is included with them in the Holy Trinity.  For the
   Only-begotten Son of God said plainly to the Apostles, Go ye, and make
   disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost [1973] .  Our hope is in
   Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost.  We preach not three Gods [1974] ; let
   the Marcionites be silenced; but with the Holy Ghost through One Son,
   we preach One God.  The Faith is indivisible; the worship inseparable.
   We neither separate the Holy Trinity, like some; nor do we as Sabellius
   work confusion. [1975]   But we know according to godliness One Father,
   who sent His Son to be our Saviour; we know One Son, who promised that
   He would send the Comforter from the Father; we know the Holy Ghost,
   who spake in the Prophets, and who on the day of Pentecost descended on
   the Apostles in the form of fiery tongues, here, in Jerusalem, in the
   Upper Church of the Apostles [1976] ; for in all things the choicest
   privileges are with us.  Here Christ came down from heaven; here the
   Holy Ghost came down from heaven.  And in truth it were most fitting,
   that as we discourse concerning Christ and Golgotha here in Golgotha,
   so also we should speak concerning the Holy Ghost in the Upper Church;
   yet since He who descended there jointly partakes of the glory of Him
   who was crucified here, we here speak concerning Him also who descended
   there:  for their worship is indivisible.

   5.  We would now say somewhat concerning the Holy Ghost; not to declare
   His substance with exactness, for this were impossible; but to speak of
   the diverse mistakes of some concerning him, lest from ignorance we
   should fall into them; and to block up the paths of error, that we may
   journey on the King's one highway.  And if we now for caution's sake
   repeat any statement of the heretics, let it recoil on their heads, and
   may we be guiltless, both we who speak, and ye who hear.

   6.  For the heretics, who are most profane in all things, have
   sharpened their tongue [1977] against the Holy Ghost also, and have
   dared to utter impious things; as Irenæus the interpreter has written
   in his injunctions against heresies [1978] .  For some of them have
   dared to say that they were themselves the Holy Ghost;--of whom the
   first was Simon [1979] , the sorcerer spoken of in the Acts of the
   Apostles; for when he was cast out, he presumed to teach such
   doctrines:  and they who are called Gnostics, impious men, have spoken
   other things against the Spirit [1980] , and the wicked Valentinians
   [1981] again something else; and the profane Manes dared to call
   himself the Paraclete sent by Christ [1982] .  Others again have taught
   that the Spirit is different in the Prophets and in the New Testament.
   [1983]   Yea, and great is their error, or rather their blasphemy.
   Such therefore abhor, and flee from them who blaspheme the Holy Ghost,
   and have no forgiveness.  For what fellowship hast thou with the
   desperate, thou, who art now to be baptized, into the Holy Ghost also
   [1984] ?  If he who attaches himself to a thief, and consenteth with
   him, is subject to punishment, what hope shall he have, who offends
   against the Holy Ghost?

   7.  Let the Marcionists also be abhorred, who tear away from the New
   Testament the sayings of the Old [1985] .  For Marcion first, that most
   impious of men, who first asserted three Gods [1986] , knowing that in
   the New Testament are contained testimonies of the Prophets concerning
   Christ, cut out the testimonies taken from the Old Testament, that the
   King might be left without witness.  Abhor those above-mentioned
   Gnostics, men of knowledge by name, but fraught with ignorance; who
   have dared to say such things of the Holy Ghost as I dare not repeat.

   8.  Let the Cataphrygians [1987] also be thy abhorrence, and Montanus,
   their ringleader in evil, and his two so-called prophetesses, Maximilla
   and Priscilla.  For this Montanus, who was out of his mind and really
   mad (for he would not have said such things, had he not been mad),
   dared to say that he was himself the Holy Ghost,--he, miserable man,
   and filled with all uncleanness and lasciviousness; for it suffices but
   to hint at this, out of respect for the women who are present.  And
   having taken possession of Pepuza, a very small hamlet of Phrygia, he
   falsely named it Jerusalem; and cutting the throats of wretched little
   children, and chopping them up into unholy food, for the purpose of
   their so-called mysteries [1988] ,--(wherefore till but lately in the
   time of persecution we were suspected of doing this, because these
   Montanists were called, falsely indeed, by the common name of
   Christians;)--yet he dared to call himself the Holy Ghost, filled as he
   was with all impiety and inhuman cruelty, and condemned by an
   irrevocable sentence.

   9.  And he was seconded, as was said before, by that most impious Manes
   also, who combined what was bad in every heresy [1989] ; who being the
   very lowest pit of destruction, collected the doctrines of all the
   heretics, and wrought out and taught a yet more novel error, and dared
   to say that he himself was the Comforter, whom Christ promised to
   send.  But the Saviour when He promised Him, said to the Apostles, But
   tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from
   on high [1990] .  What then? did the Apostles who had been dead two
   hundred years, wait for Manes, until they should be endued with the
   power; and will any dare to say, that they were not forthwith full of
   the Holy Ghost?  Moreover it is written, Then they laid their hands on
   and they received the Holy Ghost [1991] ; was not this before Manes,
   yea, many years before, when the Holy Ghost descended on the day of
   Pentecost?

   10.  Wherefore was Simon the sorcerer condemned?  Was it not that he
   came to the Apostles, and said, Give me also this power, that on
   whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost?  For he said
   not, "Give me also the fellowship of the Holy Ghost," but "Give me the
   power;" that he might sell to others that which could not be sold, and
   which he did not himself possess.  He offered money also to them who
   had no possessions [1992] ; and this, though he saw men bringing the
   prices of the things sold, and laying them at the Apostles' feet.  And
   he considered not that they who trod under foot the wealth which was
   brought for the maintenance of the poor, were not likely to give the
   power of the Holy Ghost for a bribe.  But what say they to Simon?  Thy
   money perish with thee, because thou hast thought to purchase the gift
   of God with money [1993] ; for thou art a second Judas, for expecting
   to buy the grace of the Spirit with money.  If then Simon, for wishing
   to get this power for a price, is to perish, how great is the impiety
   of Manes, who said that he was the Holy Ghost?  Let us hate them who
   are worthy of hatred; let us turn away from them from whom God turns
   away; let us also ourselves say unto God with all boldness concerning
   all heretics, Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee, and am not I
   grieved with Thine enemies [1994] ?  For there is also an enmity which
   is right, according as it is written, I will put enmity between thee
   and her seed [1995] ; for friendship with the serpent works enmity with
   God, and death.

   11.  Let then thus much suffice concerning those outcasts; and now let
   us return to the divine Scriptures, and let us drink waters out of our
   own cisterns [that is, the holy Fathers [1996] ], and out of our own
   springing wells [1997] .  Drink we of living water, springing up into
   everlasting life [1998] ; but this spake the Saviour of the Spirit,
   which they that believe on Him should receive [1999] .  For observe
   what He says, He that believeth on Me (not simply this, but), as the
   Scripture hath said (thus He hath sent thee back to the Old Testament),
   out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water, not rivers
   perceived by sense, and merely watering the earth with its thorns and
   trees, but bringing souls to the light.  And in another place He says,
   But the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of living
   water springing up into everlasting life,--a new kind of water living
   and springing up, springing up unto them who are worthy.

   12.  And why did He call the grace of the Spirit water?  Because by
   water all things subsist; because water brings forth grass and living
   things; because the water of the showers comes down from heaven;
   because it comes down one in form, but works in many forms.  For one
   fountain watereth the whole of Paradise, and one and the same rain
   comes down upon all the world, yet it becomes white in the lily, and
   red in the rose, and purple in violets and hyacinths, and different and
   varied in each several kind:  so it is one in the palm-tree, and
   another in the vine, and all in all things; and yet is one in nature,
   not diverse from itself; for the rain does not change itself, and come
   down first as one thing, then as another, but adapting itself to the
   constitution of each thing which receives it, it becomes to each what
   is suitable [2000] .  Thus also the Holy Ghost, being one, and of one
   nature, and indivisible, divides to each His grace, according as He
   will [2001] :  and as the dry tree, after partaking of water, puts
   forth shoots, so also the soul in sin, when it has been through
   repentance made worthy of the Holy Ghost, brings forth clusters of
   righteousness.  And though He is One in nature, yet many are the
   virtues which by the will of God and in the Name of Christ He works.
   For He employs the tongue of one man for wisdom; the soul of another He
   enlightens by Prophecy; to another He gives power to drive away devils;
   to another He gives to interpret the divine Scriptures.  He strengthens
   one man's self-command; He teaches another the way to give alms;
   another He teaches to fast and discipline himself; another He teaches
   to despise the things of the body; another He trains for martyrdom:
   diverse in different men, yet not diverse from Himself, as it is
   written, But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
   profit withal.  For to one is given through the Spirit the word of
   wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge according to the same
   Spirit; to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of
   healing, in the same Spirit; and to another workings of miracles; and
   to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to
   another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of
   tongues:  but all these worketh that one and the same Spirit, dividing
   to every man severally as He will [2002] .

   13.  But since concerning spirit in general many diverse things are
   written in the divine Scriptures, and there is fear lest some out of
   ignorance fall into confusion, not knowing to what sort of spirit the
   writing refers; it will be well now to certify you, of what kind the
   Scripture declares the Holy Spirit to be.  For as Aaron is called
   Christ, and David and Saul and others are called Christs [2003] , but
   there is only one true Christ, so likewise since the name of spirit is
   given to different things, it is right to see what is that which is
   distinctively called the Holy Spirit.  For many things are called
   spirits.  Thus an Angel is called spirit, our soul is called spirit,
   and this wind which is blowing is called spirit; great virtue also is
   spoken of as spirit; and impure practice is called spirit; and a devil
   our adversary is called spirit.  Beware therefore when thou hearest
   these things, lest from their having a common name thou mistake one for
   another.  For concerning our soul the Scripture says, His spirit shall
   go forth, and he shall return to his earth [2004] :  and of the same
   soul it says again, Which formeth the spirit of man within him [2005]
   .  And of the Angels it is said in the Psalms, Who maketh His Angels
   spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire [2006] .  And of the wind it
   saith, Thou shalt break the ships of Tarshish with a violent spirit
   [2007] ; and, As the tree in the wood is shaken by the spirit [2008] ;
   and, Fire, hail, snow, ice, spirit of storm [2009] .  And of good
   doctrine the Lord Himself says, The words that I have spoken unto you,
   they are spirit [2010] , and they are life; instead of, "are
   spiritual."  But the Holy Spirit is not pronounced by the tongue; but
   He is a Living Spirit, who gives wisdom of speech, Himself speaking and
   discoursing.

   14.  And wouldest thou know that He discourses and speaks?  Philip by
   revelation of an Angel went down to the way which leads to Gaza, when
   the Eunuch was coming; and the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join
   thyself to this chariot [2011] .  Seest thou the Spirit talking to one
   who hears Him?  Ezekiel also speaks thus, The Spirit of the Lord came
   upon me, and said unto me, Thus saith the Lord [2012] .  And again, The
   Holy Ghost said [2013] , unto the Apostles who were in Antioch,
   Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
   them.  Beholdest thou the Spirit living, separating, calling, and with
   authority sending forth?  Paul also said, Save that the Holy Ghost
   witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me
   [2014] .  For this good Sanctifier of the Church, and her Helper, and
   Teacher, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, of whom the Saviour said, He
   shall teach you all things (and He said not only, He shall teach, but
   also, He shall bring to your remembrance whatever I have said unto you
   [2015] ; for the teachings of Christ and of the Holy Ghost are not
   different, but the same)--He, I say, testified before to Paul what
   things should befall him, that he might be the more stout-hearted, from
   knowing them beforehand.  Now I have spoken these things unto you
   because of the text, The words which I have spoken unto you, they are
   spirit; that thou mayest understand this, not of the utterance of the
   lips [2016] , but of the good doctrine in this passage.

   15.  But sin also is called spirit, as I have already said; only in
   another and opposite sense, as when it is said, The spirit of whoredom
   caused them to err [2017] .  The name "spirit" is given also to the
   unclean spirit, the devil; but with the addition of, "the unclean;" for
   to each is joined its distinguishing name, to mark its proper nature.
   If the Scripture speak of the soul of man, it says the spirit with the
   addition, of the man; if it mean the wind, it says, spirit of storm; if
   sin, it says, spirit of whoredom; if the devil, it says, an unclean
   spirit:  that we may know which particular thing is spoken of, and thou
   mayest not suppose that it means the Holy Ghost; God forbid!  For this
   name of spirit is common to many things; and every thing which has not
   a solid body is in a general way called spirit [2018] .  Since,
   therefore, the devils have not such bodies, they are called spirits:
   but there is a great difference; for the unclean devil, when he comes
   upon a man's soul (may the Lord deliver from him every soul of those
   who hear me, and of those who are not present), he comes like a wolf
   upon a sheep, ravening for blood, and ready to devour.  His coming is
   most fierce; the sense of it most oppressive; the mind becomes
   darkened; his attack is an injustice also, and so is his usurpation of
   another's possession.  For he makes forcible use of another's body, and
   another's instruments, as if they were his own; he throws down him who
   stands upright (for he is akin to him who fell from heaven [2019] ); he
   twists the tongue and distorts the lips; foam comes instead of words;
   the man is filled with darkness; his eye is open, yet the soul sees not
   through it; and the miserable man gasps convulsively at the point of
   death.  The devils are verily foes of men, using them foully and
   mercilessly.

   16.  Such is not the Holy Ghost; God forbid!  For His doings tend the
   contrary way, towards what is good and salutary.  First, His coming is
   gentle; the perception of Him is fragrant; His burden most light; beams
   of light and knowledge gleam forth before His coming [2020] .  He comes
   with the bowels of a true guardian:  for He comes to save, and to heal,
   to teach, to admonish, to strengthen, to exhort, to enlighten the mind,
   first of him who receives Him, and afterwards of others also, through
   him.  And as a man, who being previously in darkness then suddenly
   beholds the sun, is enlightened in his bodily sight, and sees plainly
   things which he saw not, so likewise he to whom the Holy Ghost is
   vouchsafed, is enlightened in his soul, and sees things beyond man's
   sight, which he knew not; his body is on earth, yet his soul mirrors
   forth the heavens.  He sees, like Esaias, the Lord sitting upon a
   throne high and lifted up [2021] ; he sees, like Ezekiel, Him who is
   above the Cherubim [2022] ; he sees like Daniel, ten thousand times ten
   thousand, and thousands of thousands [2023] ; and the man, who is so
   little, beholds the beginning of the world, and knows the end of the
   world, and the times intervening, and the successions of kings,--things
   which he never learned:  for the True Enlightener is present with him.
   The man is within the walls of a house; yet the power of his knowledge
   reaches far and wide, and he sees even what other men are doing.

   17.  Peter was not with Ananias and Sapphira when they sold their
   possessions, but he was present by the Spirit; Why, he says, hath Satan
   filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost [2024] ?  There was no
   accuser; there was no witness; whence knew he what had happened?
   Whiles it remained was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it
   not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine
   heart [2025] ?  The unlettered [2026] Peter, through the grace of the
   Spirit, learnt what not even the wise men of the Greeks had known.
   Thou hast the like in the case also of Elisseus.  For when he had
   freely healed the leprosy of Naaman, Gehazi received the reward, the
   reward of another's achievement; and he took the money from Naaman, and
   bestowed it in a dark place.  But the darkness is not hidden from the
   Saints [2027] .  And when he came, Elisseus asked him; and like Peter,
   when he said, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much [2028] ? he
   also enquires, Whence comest thou, Gehazi [2029] ?  Not in ignorance,
   but in sorrow ask I whence comest thou?  From darkness art thou come,
   and to darkness shalt thou go; thou hast sold the cure of the leper,
   and the leprosy is thy heritage.  I, he says, have fulfilled the
   bidding of Him who said to me, Freely ye have received, freely give
   [2030] ; but thou hast sold this grace; receive now the condition of
   the sale.  But what says Elisseus to him?  Went not mine heart with
   thee?  I was here shut in by the body, but the spirit which has been
   given me of God saw even the things afar off, and shewed me plainly
   what was doing elsewhere.  Seest thou how the Holy Ghost not only rids
   of ignorance, but invests with knowledge?  Seest thou how He enlightens
   men's souls?

   18.  Esaias lived nearly a thousand years ago; and he beheld Zion as a
   booth.  The city was still standing, and beautified with public places,
   and robed in majesty; yet he says, Zion shall be ploughed as a field
   [2031] , foretelling what is now fulfilled in our days [2032] .  And
   observe the exactness of the prophecy; for he said, And the daughter of
   Zion shall be left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of
   cucumbers [2033] .  And now the place is filled with gardens of
   cucumbers.  Seest thou how the Holy Spirit enlightens the saints?  Be
   not therefore carried away to other things, by the force of a common
   term, but keep fast the exact meaning.

   19.  And if ever, while thou hast been sitting here, a thought
   concerning chastity or virginity has come into thy mind, it has been
   His teaching.  Has not often a maiden, already at the bridal threshold
   [2034] , fled away, He teaching her the doctrine of virginity?  Has not
   often a man distinguished at court [2035] , scorned wealth and rank,
   under the teaching of the Holy Ghost?  Has not often a young man, at
   the sight of beauty, closed his eyes, and fled from the sight, and
   escaped the defilement?  Askest thou whence this has come to pass?  The
   Holy Ghost taught the soul of the young man.  Many ways of covetousness
   are there in the world; yet Christians refuse possessions:  wherefore?
   because of the teaching of the Holy Ghost.  Worthy of honour is in
   truth that Spirit, holy and good; and fittingly are we baptized into
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  A man, still clothed with a body,
   wrestles with many fiercest demons; and often the demon, whom many men
   could not master with iron bands, has been mastered by the man himself
   with words of prayer, through the power which is in him of the Holy
   Ghost; and the mere breathing of the Exorcist [2036] becomes as fire to
   that unseen foe.  A mighty ally and protector, therefore, have we from
   God; a great Teacher of the Church, a mighty Champion on our behalf.
   Let us not be afraid of the demons, nor of the devil; for mightier is
   He who fighteth for us.  Only let us open to Him our doors; for He
   goeth about seeking such as are worthy [2037] and searching on whom He
   may confer His gifts.

   20.  And He is called the Comforter, because He comforts and encourages
   us, and helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray
   for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself maketh intercession for us,
   with groanings which cannot be uttered [2038] , that is, makes
   intercession to God.  Oftentimes a man for Christ's sake has been
   outraged and dishonoured unjustly; martyrdom is at hand; tortures on
   every side, and fire, and sword, and savage beasts, and the pit.  But
   the Holy Ghost softly whispers to him, "Wait thou on the Lord [2039] ,
   O man; what is now befalling thee is a small matter, the reward will be
   great.  Suffer a little while, and thou shalt be with Angels for ever.
   The sufferings of this present time art not worthy to be compared with
   the glory which shall be revealed in us [2040] ."  He portrays to the
   man the kingdom of heaven; He gives him a glimpse of the paradise of
   delight; and the martyrs, whose bodily countenances are of necessity
   turned to their judges, but who in spirit are already in Paradise,
   despise those hardships which are seen.

   21.  And wouldest thou be sure that by the power of the Holy Ghost the
   Martyrs bear their witness?  The Saviour says to His disciples, And
   when they bring you unto the synagogues, and the magistrates, and
   authorities, be not anxious how ye shall answer, or what ye shall say;
   for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour, what ye ought to
   say [2041] .  For it is impossible to testify as a martyr for Christ's
   sake, except a man testify by the Holy Ghost; for if no man can say
   that Jesus Christ is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost [2042] , how shall
   any man give his own life for Jesus' sake, but by the Holy Ghost?

   22.  Great indeed, and all-powerful in gifts, and wonderful, is the
   Holy Ghost.  Consider, how many of you are now sitting here, how many
   souls of us are present.  He is working suitably for each, and being
   present in the midst, beholds the temper of each, beholds also his
   reasoning and his conscience, and what we say, and think, and believe
   [2043] .  Great indeed is what I have now said, and yet is it small.
   For consider, I pray, with mind enlightened by Him, how many Christians
   there are in all this diocese, and how many in the whole province
   [2044] of Palestine, and carry forward thy mind from this province, to
   the whole Roman Empire; and after this, consider the whole world; races
   of Persians, and nations of Indians, Garbs and Sarmatians, Gauls and
   Spaniards, and Moors, Libyans and Ethiopians, and the rest for whom we
   have no names; for of many of the nations not even the names have
   reached us.  Consider, I pray, of each nation, Bishops, Presbyters,
   Deacons, Solitaries, Virgins, and laity besides; and then behold their
   great Protector, and the Dispenser of their gifts;--how throughout the
   world He gives to one chastity, to another perpetual virginity, to
   another almsgiving, to another voluntary poverty, to another power of
   repelling hostile spirits.  And as the light, with one touch of its
   radiance sheds brightness on all things, so also the Holy Ghost
   enlightens those who have eyes; for if any from blindness is not
   vouchsafed His grace, let him not blame the Spirit, but his own
   unbelief.

   23.  Thou hast seen His power, which is in all the world; tarry now no
   longer upon earth, but ascend on high.  Ascend, I say, in imagination
   even unto the first heaven, and behold there so many countless myriads
   of Angels.  Mount up in thy thoughts, if thou canst, yet higher;
   consider, I pray thee, the Archangels, consider also the Spirits;
   consider the Virtues, consider the Principalities, consider the Powers,
   consider the Thrones, consider the Dominions [2045] ;--of all these the
   Comforter is the Ruler from God, and the Teacher, and the Sanctifier.
   Of Him Elias has need, and Elisseus, and Esaias, among men; of Him
   Michael and Gabriel have need among Angels.  Naught of things created
   is equal in honour to Him:  for the families of the Angels, and all
   their hosts assembled together, have no equality with the Holy Ghost.
   All these the all-excellent power of the Comforter overshadows.  And
   they indeed are sent forth to minister [2046] , but He searches even
   the deep things of God, according as the Apostle says, For the Spirit
   searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  For what man
   knoweth the thing of a man, save the spirit of the man which is in him?
   even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God [2047]
   .

   24.  He preached concerning Christ in the Prophets; He wrought in the
   Apostles; He to this day seals the souls in Baptism.  And the Father
   indeed gives to the Son; and the Son shares with the Holy Ghost.  For
   it is Jesus Himself, not I, who says, All things are delivered unto Me
   of My Father [2048] ; and of the Holy Ghost He says, When He, the
   Spirit of Truth, shall come, and the rest....He shall glorify Me; for
   He shall receive of Mine, and shall shew it unto you [2049] .  The
   Father through the Son, with the Holy Ghost, is the giver of all grace;
   the gifts of the Father are none other than those of the Son, and those
   of the Holy Ghost; for there is one Salvation, one Power, one Faith;
   One God, the Father; One Lord, His only-begotten Son; One Holy Ghost,
   the Comforter.  And it is enough for us to know these things; but
   inquire not curiously into His nature or substance [2050] :  for had it
   been written, we would have spoken of it; what is not written, let us
   not venture on; it is sufficient for our salvation to know, that there
   is Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost.

   25.  This Spirit descended upon the seventy Elders in the days of
   Moses.  (Now let not the length of the discourse, beloved, produce
   weariness in you:  but may He the very subject of our discourse grant
   strength to every one, both to us who speak, and to you who listen!)
   This Spirit, as I was saying, came down upon the seventy Elders in the
   time of Moses; and this I say to thee, that I may now prove, that He
   knoweth all things, and worketh as He will [2051] .   The seventy
   Elders were chosen; And the Lord came down in a cloud, and took of the
   Spirit that was upon Moses, and put it upon the seventy Elders [2052] ;
   not that the Spirit was divided, but that His grace was distributed in
   proportion to the vessels, and the capacity of the recipients.  Now
   there were present sixty and eight, and they prophesied; but Eldad and
   Modad were not present:  therefore that it might be shewn that it was
   not Moses who bestowed the gift, but the Spirit who wrought, Eldad and
   Modad, who though called, had not as yet presented themselves, did also
   prophesy [2053] .

   26.  Jesus the Son of Nun, the successor of Moses, was amazed; and came
   to him and said, "Hast thou heard that Eldad and Modad are
   prophesying?  They were called, and they came not; my lord Moses,
   forbid them [2054] ."  "I cannot forbid them," he says, "for this grace
   is from Heaven; nay, so far am I from forbidding them, that I myself am
   thankful for it.  I think not, however, that thou hast said this in
   envy; art thou jealous for my sake, because that they prophesy, and
   thou prophesiest not yet?  Wait for the proper season; and oh that all
   the Lord's people may be prophets, whenever the Lord shall give His
   Spirit upon them [2055] !" saying this also prophetically, whenever the
   Lord shall give; "For as yet then He has not given it; so thou hast it
   not yet."--Had not then Abraham this, and Isaac, and Jacob, and
   Joseph?  And they of old, had they it not?  Nay, but the words,
   "whenever the Lord shall give" evidently mean "give it upon all; as yet
   indeed the grace is partial, then it shall be given lavishly."  And he
   secretly alluded to what was to happen among us on the day of
   Pentecost; for He Himself came down among us.  He had however also come
   down upon many before.  For it is written, And Jesus the son of Nun was
   filled with a spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him
   [2056] .  Thou seest the figure everywhere the same in the Old and New
   Testament;--in the days of Moses, the Spirit was given by laying on of
   hands; and by laying on of hands Peter [2057] also gives the Spirit.
   And on thee also, who art about to be baptized, shall His grace come;
   yet in what manner I say not, for I will not anticipate the proper
   season.

   27.  He also came down upon all righteous men and Prophets; Enos, I
   mean, and Enoch, and Noah, and the rest; upon Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob; for as regards Joseph, even Pharaoh perceived that he had the
   Spirit of God within him [2058] .  As to Moses, and the wonderful works
   wrought by the Spirit in his days, thou hast heard often:  This Spirit
   Job also had, that most enduring man, and all the saints, though we
   repeat not all their names.  He also was sent forth when the Tabernacle
   was in making, and filled with wisdom the wise-hearted men who were
   with Bezaleel [2059] .

   28.  In the might of this Spirit, as we have it in the Book of Judges,
   Othniel judged [2060] ; Gideon [2061] waxed strong; Jephtha conquered
   [2062] ; Deborah, a woman, waged war; and Samson, so long as he did
   righteously, and grieved Him not, wrought deeds above man's power.  And
   as for Samuel and David, we have it plainly in the Books of the
   Kingdoms, how by the Holy Ghost they prophesied themselves, and were
   rulers of the prophets;--and Samuel was called the Seer [2063] ; and
   David says distinctly, The Spirit of the Lord spake by me [2064] , and
   in the Psalms, And take not thy Holy Spirit from me [2065] , and again,
   Thy good Spirit shall lead me in the land of righteousness [2066] .
   And as we have it in Chronicles, Azariah [2067] , in the time of King
   Asa, and Jahaziel [2068] in the time of King Jehoshaphat, partook of
   the Holy Ghost; and again, another Azariah, he who was stoned [2069] .
   And Ezra says, Thou gavest also Thy good Spirit to instruct them [2070]
   .  But as touching Elias who was taken up, and Elisseus, those inspired
   [2071] and wonder-working men, it is manifest, without our saying so,
   that they were full of the Holy Ghost.

   29.  And if further a man peruse all the books of the Prophets, both of
   the Twelve, and of the others, he will find many testimonies
   concerning. the Holy Ghost; as when Micah says in the person of God,
   surely I will perfect power by the Spirit the Lord [2072] ; and Joel
   cries, And it shall come to pass afterwards, saith God, that I will
   pour out My Spirit upon all flesh [2073] , and the rest; and Haggai,
   Because I am with you, saith the Lord of Hosts [2074] ; and My Spirit
   remaineth in the midst of you [2075] ; and in like manner Zechariah,
   But receive My words and My statutes which I command by My Spirit, to
   My servants the Prophets [2076] ; and other passages.

   30.  Esaias too, with his majestic voice, says, And the Spirit of God
   shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit
   of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and godliness; and the
   Spirit of the fear of God shall fill Him [2077] ; signifying that the
   Spirit is one and undivided, but His operations various.  So again,
   Jacob My servant,.....I have put My Spirit upon Him [2078] .  And
   again, I will pour My Spirit upon thy seed [2079] ; and again, And now
   the Lord Almighty and His Spirit hath sent Me [2080] ; and again, This
   is My covenant with them, saith the Lord, My Spirit which is upon thee
   [2081] ; and again, The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath
   anointed Me [2082] , and the rest; and again in his charge against the
   Jews, But they rebelled and vexed His Holy Spirit [2083] , and Where is
   He that put His Holy Spirit within them [2084] ?  Also thou hast in
   Ezekiel (if thou be not now weary of listening), what has already been
   quoted, And the Spirit fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus
   saith the Lord [2085] .  But the words, fell upon me we must understand
   in a good sense, that is "lovingly;" and as Jacob, when he had found
   Joseph, fell upon his neck; as also in the Gospels, the loving father,
   on seeing his son who had returned from his wandering, had compassion,
   and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him [2086] .  And again in
   Ezekiel, And he brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into
   Chaldæa, to them of the captivity [2087] .  And other texts thou
   heardest before, in what was said about Baptism; Then will I sprinkle
   clean water upon you [2088] , and the rest; a new heart also will I
   give you, and a new spirit will I put within you [2089] ; and then
   immediately, And I will put My Spirit within you [2090] .  And again,
   The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of
   the Lord [2091] .

   31.  He endued with wisdom the soul of Daniel, that young as he was he
   should become a judge of Elders.  The chaste Susanna was condemned as a
   wanton; there was none to plead her cause; for who was to deliver her
   from the rulers?  She was led away to death, she was now in the hands
   of the executioners.  But her Helper was at hand, the Comforter, the
   Spirit who sanctifies every rational nature.  Come hither to me, He
   says to Daniel; young though thou be, convict old men infected with the
   sins of youth; for it is written, God raised up the Holy Spirit upon a
   young stripling [2092] ; and nevertheless, (to pass on quickly,) by the
   sentence of Daniel that chaste lady was saved.  We bring this forward
   as a testimony; for this is not the season for expounding.
   Nebuchadnezzar also knew that the Holy Spirit was in Daniel; for he
   says to him, O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, of whom I know,
   that the Holy Spirit of God is in thee [2093] .  One thing he said
   truly, and one falsely; for that he had the Holy Spirit was true, but
   he was not the master of the magicians, for he was no magician, but was
   wise through the Holy Ghost.  And before this also, he interpreted to
   him the vision of the Image, which he who had seen it himself knew not;
   for he says, Tell me the vision, which I who saw it know not [2094] .
   Thou seest the power of the Holy Ghost; that which they who saw it,
   know not, they who saw it not, know and interpret.

   32.  And indeed it were easy to collect very many texts out of the Old
   Testament, and to discourse more largely concerning the Holy Ghost.
   But the time is short; and we must be careful of the proper length of
   the lecture.  Wherefore, being for the present content awhile with
   passages from the Old Testament, we will, if it be God's pleasure,
   proceed in the next Lecture to the remaining texts out of the New
   Testament.  And may the God of peace, through our Lord Jesus Christ,
   and through the love of the Spirit, count all of you worthy of His
   spiritual and heavenly gifts:--To whom be glory and power for ever and
   ever.  Amen.

   [1970] Matt. xii. 32.

   [1971] At the end of this section there follows in the Coislin ms. a
   long interpolation consisting of two parts.  The former is an extract
   taken word for word from Gregory of Nyssa, Oratio Catechetica, ii. c,
   which may be read in this series:  'All' hos Theou Logon akousantes
   ....sundromon echousan te boulesei ten dunamin.  Of the second passage
   the Benedictine Editor says:  "I have not been able to discover who is
   the author.  No one can assign it to our Cyril, although the doctrine
   it contains is in full agreement with his:  but he explains all the
   same points more at large in his two Lectures (xvi. xvii.).  The
   passage is very ancient and undoubtedly older than the eleventh
   century, which is the date of the Cod. Coislin.  Therefore in the
   controversy of the Latins against the Greeks concerning the Procession
   of the Holy Ghost it is important to notice what is taught in this
   passage, and also brought forward as a testimony by S. Thomas
   (Aquinas), that "The Holy Ghost is of the Godhead of the Father and the
   Son (ex Patris et Filii divinitate existere)."  To me indeed these
   words seem to savour altogether not of the later but of the more
   ancient theology of the Greeks, and to be earlier than the
   controversies of the Greeks against the Latins." This second passage is
   as follows:-- "For the Spirit of God is good.  And Thy good Spirit,
   says David, shall lead me in the land of righteousness.  This then is
   the Spirit of God in which we believe:  the blessed Spirit, the
   eternal, immutable, unchangeable, ineffable:  which rules and reigns
   over all productive being, both visible and invisible natures:  which
   is Lord both of Angels and Archangels, Powers, Principalities,
   Dominions, Thrones:  the Creator of all being, enthroned with the glory
   of the Father and the Son, reigning without beginning and without end
   with the Father and the Son, before the created substances:  Who
   sanctifies the ministering spirits sent forth for the sake of those who
   are to inherit salvation:  Who came down upon the holy and blessed
   Virgin Mary, of whom was born Christ according to the flesh; came down
   also upon the Lord Himself in bodily form of a dove in the river
   Jordan:  Who came upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost in form of
   fiery tongues; Who gives and supplies all spiritual gifts in the
   Church, Who Proceedeth from the Father:  Who is of the Godhead of the
   Father and the Son; Who is of one substance with the Father and the
   Son, inseparable and indivisible."

   [1972] Cf. Cat. iv. 33; vii. 6.  Irenæus, Hæres. III. xxi. 4; IV. ix.
   1.  In Eusebius, E.H. V. 13, Rhodon says that Apelles attributed the
   prophecies to an adverse spirit and rejected them as false and
   self-contradictory.  Similar blasphemies against the holy Prophets are
   imputed to Manes by Epiphanius (Hæres. lxvi. 30).

   [1973] Matt. xxviii. 19.  The same text is used with much force by S.
   Basil (De Spir. S. cap. xxiv.).

   Arian. Or. I. viii. 1; Ib. Or. III. xxv. 9; Ib. xxvii. 3.  Marcion's
   doctrine of three first principles (trion archon logos) is discussed by
   Epiphanius (Hæres. xlii. 6, 7).  See also Tertull. Contra Marcion. I.
   15; Euseb. Hist. Eccles. V. 13.

   [1976] Cat. xvii. 13.  Epiphanius (De Mensuris et Ponder. c. 14):  "And
   he (Hadrian) found the city all levelled to the ground, except a few
   houses, and the Church of God which was small:  where the Disciples, on
   their return after the Saviour was taken up from the Mount of Olives,
   went up into the upper chamber:  for there it had been built, that is
   on Sion."  Cf. Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, c. xiv. 3:  "Within the
   precincts of that Mosque (of the Tomb of David) is a vaulted Gothic
   chamber, which contains within its four walls a greater confluence of
   traditions than any other place of like dimensions in Palestine.  It is
   startling to hear that this is the scene of the Last Supper, of the
   meeting after the Resurrection, of the miracle of Pentecost, of the
   residence and death of the Virgin, of the burial of Stephen."

   [1977] Ps. cxl. 3.

   [1978] Irenæus is called "the interpreter" in the same general sense as
   other ecclesiastical authors (Cat. xiii. 21; xv. 20), on account of his
   frequent comments upon the Scriptures.  The full title of his work was
   A Refutation and Subversion of Knowledge falsely so called (Euseb.
   Hist. Eccles. V. c. 7).  Cyril's expression (en tois prostagmasi) is
   sufficiently appropriate to the hortatory purpose professed by Irenæus
   in his preface.  But the Benedictine Editor thinks that the word
   prostagmasi may be an interpolation arising from the following words
   pros tas....The meaning would then be "in his writings Against
   Heresies," the usual short title of the work.

   [1985] See Dict. Christ. Biography, Marcion, p. 283; and Tertullian
   (Adv. Marcion. IV. 6):  "His whole aim centres in this that he may
   establish a diversity between the Old and New Testaments, so that his
   own Christ may be separate from the Creator, as belonging to the rival
   god, and as alien from the Law and the Prophets.

   [1986] Cf. § 4, note 5, above.

   [1987] Phrygians, or Cataphrygians (hoi kata phrugas) was the name
   given to the followers of the Phrygian Montanus.  See the account of
   Montanism in Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. V. xvi., and the note there in this
   Series.

   [1988] The charges of lust and cruelty brought against the Montanists
   by Cyril and Epiphanius (Hær 48) seem to rest on no trustworthy
   evidence, and are not mentioned by Eusebius, a bitter foe to the sect.

   [2020] In this contrast between the evil spirit and the Spirit of God

   with our eyes the Sion of old renown being ploughed by Romans with
   yokes of oxen, and Jerusalem in a state of utter desolation as the
   oracle itself says, like a lodge in a garden of cucumbers.  As Cyril at
   that time saw the Prophet's prediction fulfilled, so we also to the
   present day see most plainly the fulfilment of the divine oracle, and
   Sion ploughed before our eyes:  for except the Church of the Apostles,
   with the houses lying around it, and the house of Caiaphas and the
   cemeteries, all the remaining space of this hill, lying without the
   city, is under plough." (Jerusalem Editor).

   [2033] Isa. i. 8.  oporophulakion is the hut of the watchman who
   guarded the crop when ripening for harvest.  Sikuelaton is explained by
   Basil in his comment on the passage of Isaiah as "A place that produces
   quick-growing and perishable fruits."  This agrees with the
   etymological sense of the word as "a forcing-bed for cucumbers"
   (Hippocrates apud Fritzsche, "Der Brief des Jeremia," v. 70).  On the
   form sikuerato, see the notes on the Epistle of Jeremy in the Speaker's
   Commentary.

   [2034] pastadas.  On the meaning of pastas see the notes on Herodotus,
   II. 148, 169 in Bähr, and Rawlinson.  Here it appears to mean the

   Lecture XVII.

   Continuation of the Discourse on the Holy Ghost.

   1 Corinthians xii. 8

   For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, &c.

   1.  In the preceding Lecture, according to our ability we set before
   you, our beloved hearers [2095] , some small portion of the testimonies
   concerning the Holy Ghost; and on the present occasion, we will, if it
   be God's pleasure, proceed to treat, as far as may be, of those which
   remain out of the New Testament:  and as then to keep within due limit
   of your attention we restrained our eagerness (for there is no satiety
   in discoursing concerning the Holy Ghost), so now again we must say but
   a small part of what remains.  For now, as well as then, we candidly
   own that our weakness is overwhelmed by the multitude of things
   written.  Neither to-day will we use the subtleties of men, for that is
   unprofitable; but merely call to mind what comes from the divine
   Scriptures; for this is the safest course, according to the blessed
   Apostle Paul, who says, Which things also we speak, not in words which
   man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing
   spiritual things with spiritual [2096] .  Thus we act like travellers
   or voyagers, who having one goal to a very long journey, though
   hastening on with eagerness, yet by reason of human weakness are wont
   to touch in their way at divers cities or harbours.

   2.  Therefore though our discourses concerning the Holy Ghost are
   divided, yet He Himself is undivided, being one and the same.  For as
   in speaking concerning the Father, at one time we taught how He is the
   one only Cause [2097] ; and at another, how He is called Father [2098]
   , or Almighty [2099] ; and at another, how He is the Creator [2100] of
   the universe; and yet the division of the Lectures made no division of
   the Faith, in that He, the Object of devotion, both was and is
   One;--and again, as in discoursing concerning the Only-begotten Son of
   God we taught at one time concerning His Godhead [2101] , and at
   another concerning His Manhood [2102] , dividing into many discourses
   the doctrines concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, yet preaching undivided
   faith towards Him;--so now also though the Lectures concerning the Holy
   Spirit are divided, yet we preach faith undivided towards Him.  For it
   is one and the Self-same Spirit who divides His gifts to every man
   severally as He will [2103] , Himself the while remaining undivided.
   For the Comforter is not different from the Holy Ghost, but one and the
   self-same, called by various names; who lives and subsists, and speaks,
   and works; and of all rational natures made by God through Christ, both
   of Angels and of men, He is the Sanctifier [2104] .

   3.  But lest any from lack of learning, should suppose from the
   different titles of the Holy Ghost that these are divers spirits, and
   not one and the self-same, which alone there is, therefore the Catholic
   Church guarding thee beforehand hath delivered to thee in the
   profession of the faith, that thou "believe in one Holy Ghost the
   Comforter, who spake by the Prophets;" that thou mightest know, that
   though His names be many, the Holy Spirit is but one;--of which names,
   we will now rehearse to you a few out of many.

   4.  He is called the Spirit, according to the Scripture just now read,
   For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom [2105] .  He is
   called the Spirit of Truth, as the Saviour says, When He, the Spirit of
   Truth, is come [2106] .  He is called also the Comforter, as He said,
   For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you [2107] .
   But that He is one and the same, though called by different titles, is
   shewn plainly from the following.  For that the Holy Spirit and the
   Comforter are the same, is declared in those words, But the Comforter,
   which is the Holy Ghost [2108] ; and that the Comforter is the same as
   the Spirit of Truth, is declared, when it is said, And I will give you
   another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit
   of Truth [2109] ; and again, But when the Comforter is come whom I will
   send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth [2110] .  And
   He is called the Spirit of God, according as it is written, And I saw
   the Spirit of God descending [2111] ; and again, For as many as are led
   by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God [2112] .  He is called
   also the Spirit of the Father, as the Saviour says, For it is not ye
   that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you [2113]
   ; and again Paul saith, For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,
   and the rest;...that He would grant you to be strengthened by His
   Spirit [2114] .  He is also called the Spirit of the Lord, according to
   that which Peter spake, Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt
   the Spirit of the Lord [2115] ?  He is called also the Spirit of God
   and Christ, as Paul writes, But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
   Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.  But if any man
   have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His [2116] .  He is called
   also the Spirit of the Son of God, as it is said, And because ye are
   sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son [2117] .  He is called
   also the Spirit of Christ, as it is written, Searching what or what
   manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify
   [2118] ; and again, Through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit
   of Jesus Christ [2119] .

   5.  Thou wilt find many other titles of the Holy Ghost besides.  Thus
   He is called the Spirit of Holiness, as it is written, According to the
   Spirit of Holiness [2120] .  He is also called the Spirit of adoption,
   as Paul saith, For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto
   fear, but ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
   Father [2121] .  He is also called the Spirit of revelation, as it is
   written, May give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
   knowledge of Him [2122] .  He is also called the Spirit of promise, as
   the same Paul says, In whom ye also after that ye believed, were sealed
   with the Holy Spirit of promise [2123] .  He is also called the Spirit
   of grace, as when he says again, And hath done despite to the Spirit of
   grace [2124] .  And by many other such-like titles is He named.  And
   thou heardest plainly in the foregoing Lecture, that in the Psalms He
   is called at one time the good Spirit [2125] , and at another the
   princely Spirit [2126] ; and in Esaias He was styled the Spirit of
   wisdom and understanding, of counsel, and might, of knowledge, and of
   godliness, and of the fear of God [2127] .  By all which Scriptures
   both those before and those now alleged, it is established, that though
   the titles of the Holy Ghost be different, He is one and the same;
   living and subsisting, and always present together with the Father and
   the Son [2128] ; not uttered or breathed from the mouth and lips of the
   Father or the Son, nor dispersed into the air, but having a real
   substance [2129] , Himself speaking, and working, and dispensing, and
   sanctifying; even as the Economy of salvation which is to usward from
   the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, is inseparable and
   harmonious and one, as we have also said before.  For I wish you to
   keep in mind those things which were lately spoken, and to know clearly
   that there is not one Spirit in the Law and the Prophets, and another
   in the Gospels and Apostles; but that it is One and the Self-same Holy
   Spirit, which both in the Old and in the New Testament, spoke the
   divine Scriptures [2130] .

   6.  This is the Holy Ghost, who came upon the Holy Virgin Mary; for
   since He who was conceived was Christ the Only-begotten, the power of
   the Highest overshadowed her, and the Holy Ghost came upon her [2131] ,
   and sanctified her, that she might be able to receive Him, by whom all
   things were made [2132] .  But I have no need of many words to teach
   thee that generation was without defilement or taint, for thou hast
   learned it.  It is Gabriel who says to her, I am the herald of what
   shall be done, but have no part in the work.  Though an Archangel, I
   know my place; and though I joyfully bid thee All hail, yet how thou
   shalt bring forth, is not of any grace of mine.  The Holy Ghost shall
   come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee;
   therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be
   called the Son of God [2133] .

   7.  This Holy Spirit wrought in Elisabeth; for He recognises not
   virgins only, but matrons also, so that their marriage be lawful.  And
   Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost [2134] , and prophesied; and
   that noble hand-maiden says of her own Lord, And whence is this to me,
   that the Mother of my Lord should come to me [2135] ?  For Elisabeth
   counted herself blessed.  Filled with this Holy Spirit, Zacharias also,
   the father of John, prophesied [2136] , telling how many good things
   the Only-begotten should procure, and that John should be His harbinger
   [2137] through baptism.  By this Holy Ghost also it was revealed to
   just Symeon, that he should not see death, till he had seen the Lord's
   Christ [2138] ; and he received Him in his arms, and bore clear
   testimony in the Temple concerning Him.

   8.  And John also, who had been filled with the Holy Ghost from his
   mother's womb [2139] , was for this cause sanctified, that he might
   baptize the Lord; not giving the Spirit himself, but preaching glad
   tidings of Him who gives the Spirit.  For he says, I indeed baptize you
   with water unto repentance, but He that cometh after me, and the rest;
   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire [2140] .  But
   wherefore with fire?  Because the descent of the Holy Ghost was in
   fiery tongues; concerning which the Lord says joyfully, I am come to
   send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled
   [2141] ?

   9.  This Holy Ghost came down when the Lord was baptized, that the
   dignity of Him who was baptized might not be hidden; as John says, But
   He which sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon
   whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him,
   the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost [2142] .  But see
   what saith the Gospel; the heavens were opened; they were opened
   because of the dignity of Him who descended; for, lo, he says, the
   heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove,
   and lighting upon Him [2143] :  that is, with voluntary motion in His
   descent.  For it was fit, as some have interpreted, that the primacy
   and first-fruits [2144] of the Holy Spirit promised to the baptized
   should be conferred upon the manhood of the Saviour, who is the giver
   of such grace.  But perhaps He came down in the form of a dove, as some
   say, to exhibit a figure of that dove who is pure and innocent and
   undefiled, and also helps the prayers for the children she has
   begotten, and for forgiveness of sins [2145] ; even as it was
   emblematically foretold that Christ should be thus manifested in the
   appearance of His eyes; for in the Canticles she cries concerning the
   Bridegroom, and says, Thine eyes are as doves by the rivers of water
   [2146] .

   10.  Of this dove, the dove of Noe, according to some, was in part a
   figure [2147] .  For as in his time by means of wood and of water there
   came salvation to themselves, and the beginning of a new generation,
   and the dove returned to him towards evening with an olive branch;
   thus, say they, the Holy Ghost also descended upon the true Noe, the
   Author of the second birth, who draws together into one the wills of
   all nations, of whom the various dispositions of the animals in the ark
   were a figure:--Him at whose coming the spiritual wolves feed with the
   lambs, in whose Church the calf, and the lion, and the ox, feed in the
   same pasture, as we behold to this day the rulers of the world guided
   and taught by Churchmen.  The spiritual dove therefore, as some
   interpret, came down at the season of His baptism, that He might shew
   that it is He who by the wood of the Cross saves them who believe, He
   who at eventide should grant salvation through His death.

   11.  And these things perhaps should be otherwise explained; but now
   again we must hear the words of the Saviour Himself concerning the Holy
   Ghost.  For He says, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,
   he cannot enter into the kingdom of God [2148] .  And that this grace
   is from the Father, He thus states, How much more shall your heavenly
   Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him [2149] .  And that we
   ought to worship God in the Spirit, He shews thus, But the hour cometh
   and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in
   Spirit and in truth; for the Father also seeketh such to worship Him.
   God is a Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit
   and in truth [2150] .  And again, But if I by the Spirit of God cast
   out devils [2151] ; and immediately afterwards, Therefore I say unto
   you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but
   the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven.  And
   whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be
   forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak a word against the Holy Ghost,
   it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the
   world to come [2152] .  And again He says, And I will pray the Father,
   and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may be with you for
   ever, the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it
   seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; but ye know Him, for He abideth
   with you, and shall be in you [2153] .  And again He says, These things
   have I spoken unto you being yet present with you.  But the Comforter,
   which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall
   teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I
   said unto you [2154] .  And again He says, But when the Comforter is
   come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of
   Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me [2155]
   .  And again the Saviour says, For if I go not away, the Comforter will
   not come unto you [2156] .....And when He is come, He will convince the
   world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment [2157] ; and afterwards
   again, I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
   now.  Howbeit, when He the Spirit of Truth is come, He will declare
   unto you all the truth; for He shall not speak from Himself; but
   whatsoever He shall hear that shall He speak, and He shall announce
   unto you the things to come.  He shall glorify Me, for He shall take of
   Mine, and shall announce it unto you.  All things that the Father hath
   are mine; therefore said I, That He shall take of Mine, and shall
   announce it unto you [2158] .  I have read to thee now the utterances
   of the Only-begotten Himself, that thou mayest not give heed to men's
   words.

   12.  The fellowship of this Holy Spirit He bestowed on the Apostles;
   for it is written, And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and
   saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:  whose soever sins ye
   remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain,
   they are retained [2159] .  This was the second time He breathed on man
   (His first breath [2160] having been stifled through wilful sins); that
   the Scripture might be fulfilled, He went up breathing upon thy face,
   and delivering thee from affliction [2161] .  But whence went He up?
   From Hades; for thus the Gospel relates, that then after His
   resurrection He breathed on them.  But though He bestowed His grace
   then, He was to lavish it yet more bountifully; and He says to them, "I
   am ready to give it even now, but the vessel cannot yet hold it; for a
   while therefore receive ye as much grace as ye can bear; and look
   forward for yet more; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye
   be clothed with power from on high [2162] .  Receive it in part now;
   then, ye shall wear it in its fulness.  For he who receives, often
   possesses the gift but in part; but he who is clothed, is completely
   enfolded by his robe.  "Fear not," He says, "the weapons and darts of
   the devil; for ye shall bear with you the power of the Holy Ghost."
   But remember what was lately said, that the Holy Ghost is not divided,
   but only the grace which is given by Him.

   13.  Jesus therefore went up into heaven, and fulfilled the promise.
   For He said to them, I will pray the Father, and He shall give you
   another Comforter [2163] .  So they were sitting, looking for the
   coming of the Holy Ghost; and when the day of Pentecost was fully come,
   here, in this city of Jerusalem,--(for this honour also belongs to us
   [2164] ; and we speak not of the good things which have happened among
   others, but of those which have been vouchsafed among ourselves,)--on
   the day of Pentecost, I say, they were sitting, and the Comforter came
   down from heaven, the Guardian and Sanctifier of the Church, the Ruler
   of souls, the Pilot of the tempest-tossed, who leads the wanderers to
   the light, and presides over the combatants, and crowns the victors.

   14.  But He came down to clothe the Apostles with power, and to baptize
   them; for the Lord says, ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not
   many days hence [2165] .  This grace was not in part, but His power was
   in full perfection; for as he who plunges into the waters and is
   baptized is encompassed on all sides by the waters, so were they also
   baptized completely by the Holy Ghost.  The water however flows round
   the outside only, but the Spirit baptizes also the soul within, and
   that completely.  And wherefore wonderest thou?  Take an example from
   matter; poor indeed and common, yet useful for the simpler sort.  If
   the fire passing in through the mass of the iron makes the whole of it
   fire, so that what was cold becomes burning and what was black is made
   bright,--if fire which is a body thus penetrates and works without
   hindrance in iron which is also a body, why wonder that the Holy Ghost
   enters into the very inmost recesses of the soul?

   15.  And lest men should be ignorant of the greatness of the mighty
   gift coming down to them, there sounded as it were a heavenly trumpet,
   For suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a
   mighty wind [2166] , signifying the presence of Him who was to grant
   power unto men to seize with violence the kingdom of God; that both
   their eyes might see the fiery tongues, and their ears hear the sound.
   And it filled all the house where they were sitting; for the house
   became the vessel of the spiritual water; as the disciples sat within,
   the whole house was filled.  Thus they were entirely baptized according
   to the promise, and invested soul and body with a divine garment of
   salvation.  And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of
   fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they were all filled with the
   Holy Ghost.  They partook of fire, not of burning but of saving fire;
   of fire which consumes the thorns of sins, but gives lustre to the
   soul.  This is now coming upon you also, and that to strip away and
   consume your sins which are like thorns, and to brighten yet more that
   precious possession of your souls, and to give you grace; for He gave
   it then to the Apostles.  And He sat upon them in the form of fiery
   tongues, that they might crown themselves with new and spiritual
   diadems by fiery tongues upon their heads.  A fiery sword barred of old
   the gates of Paradise; a fiery tongue which brought salvation restored
   the gift.

   16.  And they began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them
   utterance [2167] .  The Galilean Peter or Andrew spoke Persian or
   Median.  John and the rest of the Apostles spoke every tongue to those
   of Gentile extraction; for not in our time have multitudes of strangers
   first begun to assemble here from all quarters, but they have done so
   since that time.  What teacher can be found so great as to teach men
   all at once things which they have not learned?  So many years are they
   in learning by grammar and other arts to speak only Greek well; nor yet
   do all speak this equally well; the Rhetorician perhaps succeeds in
   speaking well, and the Grammarian sometimes not well, and the skilful
   Grammarian is ignorant of the subjects of philosophy.  But the Holy
   Spirit taught them many languages at once, languages which in all their
   life they never knew.  This is in truth vast wisdom, this is power
   divine.  What a contrast of their long ignorance in time past to their
   sudden, complete and varied and unaccustomed exercise of these
   languages!

   17.  The multitude of the hearers was confounded;--it was a second
   confusion, in the room of that first evil one at Babylon.  For in that
   confusion of tongues there was division of purpose, because their
   thought was at enmity with God; but here minds were restored and
   united, because the object of interest was godly.  The means of falling
   were the means of recovery.  Wherefore they marvelled, saying [2168] ,
   How hear we them speaking?  No marvel if ye be ignorant; for even
   Nicodemus was ignorant of the coming of the Spirit, and to him it was
   said, The Spirit breatheth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice
   thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth
   [2169] ; but if, even though I hear His voice, I know not whence he
   cometh, how can I explain, what He is Himself in substance?

   18.  But others mocking said, They are full of new wine [2170] , and
   they spoke truly though in mockery.  For in truth the wine was new,
   even the grace of the New Testament; but this new wine was from a
   spiritual Vine, which had oftentimes ere this borne fruit in Prophets,
   and had budded in the New Testament.  For as in things sensible, the
   vine ever remains the same, but bears new fruits in its seasons, so
   also the self-same Spirit continuing what He is, as He had often
   wrought in Prophets, now manifested a new and marvellous work.  For
   though His grace had come before to the Fathers also, yet here it came
   exuberantly; for formerly men only partook of the Holy Ghost, but now
   they were baptized completely.

   19.  But Peter who had the Holy Ghost, and who knew what he possessed,
   says, "Men of Israel, ye who preach Joel, but know not the things which
   are written, these men are not drunken as ye suppose [2171] .  Drunken
   they are, not however as ye suppose, but according to that which is
   written, They shall be drunken with the fatness of thy house; and thou
   shalt make them drink of the torrents of thy pleasure [2172] .  They
   are drunken, with a sober drunkenness, deadly to sin and life-giving to
   the heart, a drunkenness contrary to that of the body; for this last
   causes forgetfulness even of what was known, but that bestows the
   knowledge even of what was not known.  They are drunken, for they have
   drunk the wine of the spiritual vine, which says, I am the vine and ye
   are the branches [2173] .  But if ye are not persuaded by me,
   understand what I tell you from the very time of the day; for it is the
   third hour of the day [2174] .  For He who, as Mark relates, was
   crucified at the third hour, now at the third hour sent down His
   grace.  For His grace is not other than the Spirit's grace, but He who
   was then crucified, who also gave the promise, made good that which He
   promised.  And if ye would receive a testimony also, Listen, he says:
   "But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And it shall
   come to pass after this, saith God, I will pour forth of My Spirit
   [2175] --(and this word, I will pour forth, implied a rich gift; for
   God giveth not the Spirit by measure, for the Father loveth the Son,
   and hath given all things into His hand [2176] ; and He has given Him
   the power also of bestowing the grace of the All-holy Spirit on
   whomsoever He will);--I will pour forth of My Spirit unto all flesh,
   and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; and afterwards, Yea,
   and on My servants and on My handmaidens I will pour out in those days
   of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy [2177] ."  The Holy Ghost is no
   respecter of persons; for He seeks not dignities, but piety of soul.
   Let neither the rich be puffed up, nor the poor dejected, but only let
   each prepare himself for reception of the Heavenly gift.

   20.  We have said much to-day, and perchance you are weary of
   listening; yet more still remains.  And in truth for the doctrine of
   the Holy Ghost there were need of a third lecture; and of many
   besides.  But we must have your indulgence on both points.  For as the
   Holy Festival of Easter is now at hand we have this day lengthened our
   discourse and yet we had not room to bring before you all the
   testimonies from the New Testament which we ought.  For many passages
   are still to come from the Acts of the Apostles in which the grace of
   the Holy Ghost wrought mightily in Peter and in all the Apostles
   together; many also from the Catholic Epistles, and the fourteen
   Epistles of Paul; out of all which we will now endeavour to gather a
   few, like flowers from a large meadow, merely by way of remembrance.

   21.  For in the power of the Holy Ghost, by the will of Father and Son,
   Peter stood with the Eleven, and lifting up his voice, (according to
   the text, Lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest good
   tidings to Jerusalem [2178] ), captured in the spiritual net of his
   words, about three thousand souls.  So great was the grace which
   wrought in all the Apostles together, that, out of the Jews, those
   crucifiers of Christ, this great number believed, and were baptized in
   the Name of Christ, and continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine
   and in the prayers [2179] .  And again in the same power of the Holy
   Ghost, Peter and John went up into the Temple at the hour of prayer,
   which was the ninth hour [2180] , and in the Name of Jesus healed the
   man at the Beautiful gate, who had been lame from his mother's womb for
   forty years; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken, Then shall
   the lame man leap as an hart [2181] .  And thus, as they captured in
   the spiritual net of their doctrine five thousand believers at once, so
   they confuted the misguided rulers of the people and chief priests, and
   that, not through their own wisdom, for they were unlearned and
   ignorant men [2182] , but through the mighty power of the Holy Ghost;
   for it is written, Then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said to them
   [2183] .  So great also was the grace of the Holy Ghost, which wrought
   by means of the Twelve Apostles in them who believed, that they were of
   one heart and of one soul [2184] , and their enjoyment of their goods
   was common, the possessors piously offering the prices of their
   possessions, and no one among them wanting aught; while Ananias and
   Sapphira, who attempted to lie to the Holy Ghost, underwent their
   befitting punishment.

   22.  And by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders
   wrought among the people [2185] .  And so great was the spiritual grace
   shed around the Apostles, that gentle as they were, they were the
   objects of dread; for of the rest durst no man join himself to them;
   but the people magnified them; and multitudes were added of those who
   believed on the Lord, both of men and women; and the streets were
   filled with the sick on their beds and couches, that as Peter passed
   by, at least his shadow might overshadow some of them.  And the
   multitude also of the cities round about came unto this holy Jerusalem,
   bringing sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits, and
   they were healed every one in this power of the Holy Ghost [2186] .

   23.  Again, after the Twelve Apostles had been cast into prison by the
   chief priests for preaching Christ, and had been marvellously delivered
   from it at night by an Angel, and were brought before them in the
   judgment hall from the Temple, they fearlessly rebuked them in their
   discourse to them concerning Christ, and added this, that God hath also
   given His Holy Spirit to them that obey Him [2187] .  And when they had
   been scourged, they went their way rejoicing, and ceased not to teach
   and preach Jesus as the Christ [2188] .

   24.  And it was not in the Twelve Apostles only that the grace of the
   Holy Spirit wrought, but also in the first-born children of this once
   barren Church, I mean the seven Deacons; for these also were chosen, as
   it is written, being full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom [2189] .  Of
   whom Stephen, rightly so named [2190] , the first fruits of the
   Martyrs, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, wrought great
   wonders and miracles among the people, and vanquished those who
   disputed with him; for they were not able to resist the wisdom and the
   Spirit by which he spake [2191] .  But when he was maliciously accused
   and brought to the judgment hall, he was radiant with angelic
   brightness; for all they who sat in the council, looking steadfastly on
   him, saw his face, as it had been the face of an Angel [2192] .  And
   having by his wise defence confuted the Jews, those stiffnecked men,
   uncircumcised in heart and ears, ever resisting the Holy Ghost [2193] ,
   he beheld the heavens opened, and saw the Son of Man standing on the
   right hand of God.  He saw Him, not by his own power, but, as the
   Divine Scripture says, being full of the Holy Ghost, he looked up
   steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
   on the right hand of God [2194] .

   25.  In this power of the Holy Ghost, Philip also in the Name of Christ
   at one time in the city of Samaria drove away the unclean spirits,
   crying out with a loud voice; and healed the palsied and the lame, and
   brought to Christ great multitudes of them that believe.  To whom Peter
   and John came down, and with prayer, and the laying on of hands,
   imparted the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, from which Simon Magus alone
   was declared an alien, and that justly.  And at another time Philip was
   called by the Angel of the Lord in the way, for the sake of that most
   godly Ethiopian, the Eunuch, and heard distinctly the Spirit Himself
   saying, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot [2195] .  He
   instructed the Eunuch, and baptized him, and so having sent into
   Ethiopia a herald of Christ, according as it is written, Ethiopia shall
   soon stretch out her hand unto God [2196] , he was caught away by the
   Angel, and preached the Gospel in the cities in succession.

   26.  With this Holy Spirit Paul also had been filled after his calling
   by our Lord Jesus Christ.  Let godly Ananias come as a witness to what
   we say, he who in Damascus said to him, The Lord, even Jesus who
   appeared to thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou
   mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost [2197] .
   And straightway the Spirit's mighty working changed the blindness of
   Paul's eyes into newness of sight; and having vouchsafed His seal unto
   his soul, made him a chosen vessel to bear the Name of the Lord who had
   appeared to him, before kings and the children of Israel, and rendered
   the former persecutor an ambassador and good servant,--one, who from
   Jerusalem, and even unto Illyricum, fully preached the Gospel [2198] ,
   and instructed even imperial Rome, and carried the earnestness of his
   preaching as far as Spain, undergoing conflicts innumerable, and
   performing signs and wonders.  Of him for the present enough.

   27.  In the power of the same Holy Spirit Peter also, the chief of the
   Apostles and the bearer of the keys [2199] of the kingdom of heaven,
   healed Æneas the paralytic in the Name of Christ at Lydda, which is now
   Diospolis, and at Joppa raised from the dead Tabitha rich in good
   works.  And being on the housetop in a trance, he saw heaven opened,
   and by means of the vessel let down as it were a sheet full of beasts
   of every shape and sort, he learnt plainly to call no man common or
   unclean, though he should be of the Greeks [2200] .  And when he was
   sent for by Cornelius, he heard clearly the Holy Ghost Himself saying,
   Behold, men seek thee; but arise and get thee down, and go with them,
   nothing doubting; for I have sent them [2201] .  And that it might be
   plainly shewn that those of the Gentiles also who believe are made
   partakers of the grace of the Holy Ghost, when Peter was come to
   Cesarea, and was teaching the things concerning Christ, the Scripture
   says concerning Cornelius and them who were with him; While Peter yet
   spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the
   word; so that they of the circumcision also which came with Peter were
   astonished, and when they understood it said that on the Gentiles also
   was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost [2202] .

   28.  And in Antioch also, a most renowned city of Syria, when the
   preaching of Christ took effect, Barnabas was sent hence as far as
   Antioch to help on the good work, being a good man, and full of the
   Holy Ghost, and of faith [2203] ; who seeing a great harvest of
   believers in Christ, brought Paul from Tarsus to Antioch, as his
   fellow-combatant.  And when crowds had been instructed by them and
   assembled in the Church, it came to pass that the disciples were called
   Christians first in Antioch [2204] ; the Holy Ghost, methinks,
   bestowing on the believers that new Name, which had been promised
   before by the Lord.  And the grace of the Spirit being shed forth by
   God more abundantly in Antioch, there were there prophets and teachers
   of whom Agabus was one [2205] .  And as they ministered to the Lord and
   fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work
   whereunto I have called them.  And after hands had been laid on them,
   they were sent forth by the Holy Ghost [2206] .  Now it is manifest,
   that the Spirit which speaks and sends, is a living Spirit, subsisting,
   and operating, as we have said.

   29.  This Holy Spirit, who in unison with Father and Son has
   established the New Covenant in the Church Catholic, has set us free
   from the burdens of the law grievous to be borne,--those I mean,
   concerning things common and unclean, and meats, and sabbaths, and new
   moons, and circumcision, and sprinklings, and sacrifices; which were
   given for a season, and had a shadow of the good things to come [2207]
   , but which, when the truth had come, were rightly withdrawn.  For when
   Paul and Barnabas were sent to the Apostles, because of the question
   moved at Antioch by them who said that it was necessary to be
   circumcised and to keep the customs of Moses, the Apostles who were
   here at Jerusalem by a written injunction set free the whole world from
   all the legal and typical observances; yet they attributed not to
   themselves the full authority in so great a matter, but send an
   injunction in writing, and acknowledge this:  For it hath seemed good
   unto the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than
   these necessary things; that ye abstain from things sacrificed to
   idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication
   [2208] ; shewing evidently by what they wrote, that though the writing
   was by the hands of human Apostles, yet the decree is universal from
   the Holy Ghost:  which decree Paul and Barnabas took and confirmed unto
   all the world.

   30.  And now, having proceeded thus far in my discourse, I ask
   indulgence from your love [2209] , or rather from the Spirit who dwelt
   in Paul, if I should not be able to rehearse everything, by reason of
   my own weakness, and your weariness who listen.  For when shall I in
   terms worthy of Himself declare the marvellous deeds wrought by the
   operation of the Holy Ghost in the Name of Christ?  Those wrought in
   Cyprus upon Elymas the sorcerer, and in Lystra at the healing of the
   cripple, and in Cilicia and Phrygia and Galatia and Mysia and
   Macedonia? or those at Philippi (the preaching, I mean, and the driving
   out of the spirit of divination in the Name of Christ; and the
   salvation by baptism of the jailer with his whole house at night after
   the earthquake); or the events at Thessalonica; and the address at
   Areopagus in the midst of the Athenians; or the instructions at
   Corinth, and in all Achaia?  How shall I worthily recount the mighty
   deeds which were wrought at Ephesus through Paul, by the Holy Ghost
   [2210] ?  Whom they of that City knew not before, but came to know Him
   by the doctrine of Paul; and when Paul had laid his hands on them, and
   the Holy Ghost had come upon them, they spake with tongues, and
   prophesied.  And so great spiritual grace was upon him, that not only
   his touch wrought cures, but even the handkerchiefs and napkins [2211]
   , brought from his body, healed diseases, and scared away the evil
   spirits; and at last they also who practised curious arts brought their
   books together, and burned them before all men [2212] .

   31.  I pass by the work wrought at Troas on Eutychus, who being borne
   down by his sleep fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead;
   yet was saved alive by Paul [2213] .  I also pass by the prophecies
   addressed to the Elders of Ephesus whom he called to him in Miletus, to
   whom he openly said, That the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city,
   saying [2214] --and the rest; for by saying, in every city, Paul made
   manifest that the marvellous works done by him in each city, were from
   the operative power of the Holy Ghost, by the will of God, and in the
   Name of Christ who spoke in him.  By the power of this Holy Ghost, the
   same Paul was hastening to this holy city Jerusalem, and this, though
   Agabus by the Spirit foretold what should befall him; and yet he spoke
   to the people with confidence, declaring the things concerning Christ.
   And when brought to Cesarea, and set amid tribunals of justice, at one
   time before Felix, and at another before Festus the governor and King
   Agrippa, Paul obtained of the Holy Ghost grace so great, and triumphant
   in wisdom, that at last Agrippa himself the king of the Jews said,
   Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian [2215] .  This Holy Spirit
   granted to Paul, when he was in the island of Melita also, to receive
   no harm when bitten by the viper, and to effect divers cures on the
   diseased.  This Holy Spirit guided him, the persecutor of old, as a
   herald of Christ, even as far as imperial Rome, and there he persuaded
   many of the Jews to believe in Christ, and to them who gainsaid he said
   plainly, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet, saying unto
   your fathers, and the rest [2216] .

   32.  And that Paul was full of the Holy Ghost, and all his fellow
   Apostles, and they who after them believed in Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, hear from himself as he writes plainly in his Epistles; And my
   speech, he says, and my preaching was not in persuasive words of man's
   wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power [2217] .  And
   again, But He who sealed us for this very purpose is God, who gave us
   the earnest of the Spirit [2218] .  And again, He that raised up Jesus
   from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit which
   dwelleth in you [2219] .  And again, writing to Timothy, That good
   thing which was committed to thee guard through the Holy Ghost which
   was given to us [2220] .

   33.  And that the Holy Ghost subsists, and lives, and speaks, and
   foretells, I have often said in what goes before, and Paul writes it
   plainly to Timothy:  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in later
   times some shall depart from the faith [2221] ,--which we see in the
   divisions not only of former times but also of our own; so motley and
   diversified are the errors of the heretics.  And again the same Paul
   says, Which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of
   men, as it hath now been revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets
   in the Spirit [2222] .  And again, Wherefore, as saith the Holy Ghost
   [2223] ; and again, The Holy Ghost also witnesseth to us [2224] .  And
   again he calls unto the soldiers of righteousness, saying, And take the
   helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
   God, with all prayer and supplication [2225] .  And again, Be not drunk
   with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit, speaking
   to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs [2226] .  And
   again, The grace of the Lord Jesus, and the love of God, and the
   communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all [2227] .

   34.  By all these proofs, and by more which have been passed over, is
   the personal, and sanctifying, and effectual power of the Holy Ghost
   established for those who can understand; for the time would fail me in
   my discourse if I wished to quote what yet remains concerning the Holy
   Ghost from the fourteen Epistles of Paul, wherein he has taught with
   such variety, completeness, and reverence.  And to the power of the
   Holy Ghost Himself it must belong, to grant to us forgiveness for what
   we have omitted because the days are few, and upon you the hearers to
   impress more perfectly the knowledge of what yet remains; while from
   the frequent reading of the sacred Scriptures those of you who are
   diligent come to understand these things, and by this time, both from
   these present Lectures, and from what has before been told you, hold
   more steadfastly the Faith in "One God the Father Almighty; and in our
   Lord Jesus Christ, His Only-Begotten Son; and in the Holy Ghost the
   Comforter."  Though the word itself and title of Spirit is applied to
   Them in common in the sacred Scriptures,--for it is said of the Father,
   God is a Spirit [2228] , as it is written in the Gospel according to
   John; and of the Son, A Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord [2229]
   , as Jeremias the prophet says; and of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter,
   the Holy Ghost [2230] , as was said;--yet the arrangement of articles
   in the Faith, if religiously understood, disproves the error of
   Sabellius also [2231] .  Return we therefore in our discourse to the
   point which now presses and is profitable to you.

   35.  Beware lest ever like Simon thou come to the dispensers of Baptism
   in hypocrisy, thy heart the while not seeking the truth.  It is ours to
   protest, but it is thine to secure thyself.  If thou standest in faith
   [2232] , blessed art thou; if thou hast fallen in unbelief, from this
   day forward cast away thine unbelief, and receive full assurance.  For,
   at the season of baptism, when thou art come before the Bishops, or
   Presbyters, or Deacons [2233] ,--(for its grace is everywhere, in
   villages and in cities, on them of low as on them of high degree, on
   bondsmen and on freemen, for this grace is not of men, but the gift is
   from God through men,)--approach the Minister of Baptism, but
   approaching, think not of the face of him thou seest, but remember this
   Holy Ghost of whom we are now speaking.  For He is present in readiness
   to seal thy soul, and He shall give thee that Seal at which evil
   spirits tremble, a heavenly and sacred seal, as also it is written, In
   whom also ye believed, and were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
   [2234] .

   36.  Yet He tries the soul. He casts not His pearls before swine; if
   thou play the hypocrite, though men baptize thee now, the Holy Spirit
   will not baptize thee [2235] .  But if thou approach with faith, though
   men minister in what is seen, the Holy Ghost bestows that which is
   unseen.  Thou art coming to a great trial, to a great muster [2236] ,
   in that one hour, which if thou throw away, thy disaster is
   irretrievable; but if thou be counted worthy of the grace, thy soul
   will be enlightened, thou wilt receive a power which thou hadst not,
   thou wilt receive weapons terrible to the evil spirits; and if thou
   cast not away thine arms, but keep the Seal upon thy soul, no evil
   spirit will approach thee; for he will be cowed; for verily by the
   Spirit of God are the evil spirits cast out.

   37.  If thou believe, thou shalt not only receive remission of sins,
   but also do things which pass man's power [2237] .  And mayest thou be
   worthy of the gift of prophecy also!  For thou shalt receive grace
   according to the measure of thy capacity and not of my words; for I may
   possibly speak of but small things, yet thou mayest receive greater;
   since faith is a large affair [2238] .  All thy life long will thy
   guardian the Comforter abide with thee; He will care for thee, as for
   his own soldier; for thy goings out, and thy comings in, and thy
   plotting foes.  And He will give thee gifts of grace of every kind, if
   thou grieve Him not by sin; for it is written, And grieve not the Holy
   Spirit of God, whereby ye were sealed unto the day of redemption [2239]
   .  What then, beloved, is it to preserve grace?  Be ye ready to receive
   grace, and when ye have received it, cast it not away.

   38.  And may the very God of All, who spake by the Holy Ghost through
   the prophets, who sent Him forth upon the Apostles on the day of
   Pentecost in this place, Himself send Him forth at this time also upon
   you; and by Him keep us also, imparting His benefit in common to us
   all, that we may ever render up the fruits of the Holy Ghost, love,
   joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
   temperance [2240] , in Christ Jesus our Lord:--By whom and with whom,
   together with the Holy Ghost, be glory to the Father, both now, and
   ever, and for ever and ever.  Amen.

   [2145] The Benedictine Editor adds the two last words tupon paradeloun
   from mss. Roe. Casaub. as necessary to the construction, and adds the
   following note.  "The text thus emended is capable of two senses.  The
   first, that the Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove, a pure and
   harmless bird, to shew that He is Himself as it were a mystic dove in
   His simplicity and love of children, for whose new birth and remission
   of sins at Baptism He unites His prayers with Christ's, as Cyril
   teaches in Cat. xvi. 20:  and that Christ was for the like cause
   mystically foreshown in Canticles as having eyes like a dove's.  The
   other sense is, that the Spirit descended in the form of a dove on
   Christ's Humanity in order to shew this to be as it were a dove in
   innocence, holiness, love of children, and concurrence with the Holy
   Spirit in their regeneration....Either sense is admissible, and
   maintained by many of the Fathers:  but I prefer the former."  This
   interpretation is confirmed by Tertullian (de Baptismo, c. viii.), who
   says that the Holy Spirit glided down on the Lord "in the shape of a
   dove" in order that the nature of the Holy Spirit might be declared by
   means of a creature of simplicity and innocence."

   [2147] Tertullian, ibid.  "Just as after the waters of the deluge, by
   which the old iniquity was purged--after the baptism, so to say, of the
   world--a dove was the herald which announced to the earth the
   assuagement of celestial wrath,....so to our flesh, as it emerges from
   the font after its old sins, flies the dove of the Holy Spirit,
   bringing us the peace of God, sent out from heaven where the Church is,
   the typified ark."  Compare also Hippolytus, The Holy Theophany, §§ 8,

   Lecture XVIII.

   On the Words, And in One Holy Catholic Church, and in the Resurrection
   of the Flesh, and the Life Everlasting.

   Ezekiel xxxvii. 1

   The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of
   the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of
   bones.

   1.  The root of all good works is the hope of the Resurrection; for the
   expectation of the recompense nerves the soul to good works.  For every
   labourer is ready to endure the toils, if he sees their reward in
   prospect; but when men weary themselves for nought, their heart soon
   sinks as well as their body.  A soldier who expects a prize is ready
   for war, but no one is forward to die for a king who is indifferent
   about those who serve under him, and bestows no honours on their
   toils.  In like manner every soul believing in a Resurrection is
   naturally careful of itself; but, disbelieving it, abandons itself to
   perdition.  He who believes that his body shall remain to rise again,
   is careful of his robe, and defiles it not with fornication; but he who
   disbelieves the Resurrection, gives himself to fornication, and misuses
   his own body, as though it were not his own.  Faith therefore in the
   Resurrection of the dead, is a great commandment and doctrine of the
   Holy Catholic Church; great and most necessary, though gainsaid by
   many, yet surely warranted by the truth.  Greeks contradict it [2241] ,
   Samaritans [2242] disbelieve it, heretics [2243] mutilate it; the
   contradiction is manifold, but the truth is uniform.

   2.  Now Greeks and Samaritans together argue against us thus.  The dead
   man has fallen, and mouldered away, and is all turned into worms; and
   the worms have died also; such is the decay and destruction which has
   overtaken the body; how then is it to be raised?  The shipwrecked have
   been devoured by fishes, which are themselves devoured.  Of them who
   fight with wild beasts the very bones are ground to powder, and
   consumed by bears and lions.  Vultures and ravens feed on the flesh of
   the unburied dead, and then fly away over all the world; whence then is
   the body to be collected?  For of the fowls who have devoured it some
   may chance to die in India, some in Persia, some in the land of the
   Goths.  Other men again are consumed by fire, and their very ashes
   scattered by rain or wind; whence is the body to be brought together
   again [2244] ?

   3.  To thee, poor little feeble man, India is far from the land of the
   Goths, and Spain from Persia; but to God, who holds the whole earth in
   the hollow of His hand [2245] , all things are near at hand.  Impute
   not then weakness to God, from a comparison of thy feebleness, but
   rather dwell on His power [2246] .  Does then the sun, a small work of
   God, by one glance of his beams give warmth to the whole world; does
   the atmosphere, which God has made, encompass all things in the world;
   and is God, who is the Creator both of the sun, and of the atmosphere,
   far off from the world?  Imagine a mixture of seeds of different plants
   (for as thou art weak concerning the faith, the examples which I allege
   are weak also), and that these different seeds are contained in thy
   single hand; is it then to thee, who art a man, a difficult or an easy
   matter to separate what is in thine hand, and to collect each seed
   according to its nature, and restore it to its own kind?  Canst thou
   then separate the things in thine hand, and cannot God separate the
   things contained in His hand, and restore them to their proper place?
   Consider what I say, whether it is not impious to deny it?

   4.  But further, attend, I pray, to the very principle of justice, and
   come to thine own case.  Thou hast different sorts of servants:  and
   some are good and some bad; thou honourest therefore the good, and
   smitest the bad.  And if thou art a judge, to the good thou awardest
   praise, and to the transgressors, punishment.  Is then justice observed
   by thee a mortal man; and with God, the ever changeless King of all, is
   there no retributive justice [2247] ?  Nay, to deny it is impious.  For
   consider what I say.  Many murderers have died in their beds
   unpunished; where then is the righteousness of God?  Yea, ofttimes a
   murderer guilty of fifty murders is beheaded once; where then shall he
   suffer punishment for the forty and nine?  Unless there is a judgment
   and a retribution after this world, thou chargest God with
   unrighteousness.  Marvel not, however, because of the delay of the
   judgment; no combatant is crowned or disgraced, till the contest is
   over; and no president of the games ever crowns men while yet striving,
   but he waits till all the combatants are finished, that then deciding
   between them he may dispense the prizes and the chaplets [2248] .  Even
   thus God also, so long as the strife in this world lasts, succours the
   just but partially, but afterwards He renders to them their rewards
   fully.

   5.  But if according to thee there is no resurrection of the dead,
   wherefore condemnest thou the robbers of graves?  For if the body
   perishes, and there is no resurrection to be hoped for, why does the
   violator of the tomb undergo punishment?  Thou seest that though thou
   deny it with thy lips, there yet abides with thee an indestructible
   instinct of the resurrection.

   6.  Further, does a tree after it has been cut down blossom again, and
   shall man after being cut down blossom no more?  And does the corn sown
   and reaped remain for the threshing floor, and shall man when reaped
   from this world not remain for the threshing?  And do shoots of vine or
   other trees, when clean cut off and transplanted, come to life and bear
   fruit; and shall man, for whose sake all these exist, fall into the
   earth and not rise again?  Comparing efforts, which is greater, to
   mould from the beginning a statue which did not exist, or to recast in
   the same shape that which had fallen?  Is God then, who created us out
   of nothing, unable to raise again those who exist and are fallen [2249]
   ?  But thou believest not what is written of the resurrection, being a
   Greek:  then from the analogy of nature consider these matters, and
   understand them from what is seen to this day.  Wheat, it may be, or
   some other kind of grain, is sown; and when the seed has fallen, it
   dies and rots, and is henceforth useless for food.  But that which has
   rotted, springs up in verdure; and though small when sown, springs up
   most beautiful.  Now wheat was made for us; for wheat and all seeds
   were created not for themselves, but for our use; are then the things
   which were made for us quickened when they die, and do we for whom they
   were made, not rise again after our death [2250] ?

   7.  The season is winter [2251] , as thou seest; the trees now stand as
   if they were dead:  for where are the leaves of the fig-tree? where are
   the clusters of the vine?  These in winter time are dead, but green in
   spring; and when the season is come, there is restored to them a
   quickening as it were from a state of death.  For God, knowing thine
   unbelief, works a resurrection year by year in these visible things;
   that, beholding what happens to things inanimate, thou mayest believe
   concerning things animate and rational.  Further, flies and bees are
   often drowned in water, yet after a while revive [2252] ; and species
   of dormice [2253] , after remaining motionless during the winter, are
   restored in the summer (for to thy slight thoughts like examples are
   offered); and shall He who to irrational and despised creatures grants
   life supernaturally, not bestow it upon us, for whose sake He made
   them?

   8.  But the Greeks ask for a resurrection of the dead still manifest;
   and say that, even if these creatures are raised, yet they had not
   utterly mouldered away; and they require to see distinctly some
   creature rise again after complete decay.  God knew men's unbelief, and
   provided for this purpose a bird, called a Phoenix [2254] .  This bird,
   as Clement writes, and as many more relate, being the only one of its
   kind [2255] , arrives in the land of the Egyptians at periods of five
   hundred years, shewing forth the resurrection, not in desert places,
   lest the occurrence of the mystery should remain unknown, but appearing
   in a notable city [2256] , that men might even handle what would
   otherwise be disbelieved.  For it makes itself a coffin [2257] of
   frankincense and myrrh and other spices, and entering into this when
   its years are fulfilled, it evidently dies and moulders away.  Then
   from the decayed flesh of the dead bird a worm is engendered, and this
   worm when grown large is transformed into a bird;--and do not
   disbelieve this, for thou seest the offspring of bees also fashioned
   thus out of worms [2258] , and from eggs which are quite fluid thou
   hast seen wings and bones and sinews of birds issue.  Afterwards the
   aforesaid Phoenix, becoming fledged and a full-grown Phoenix, like the
   former one, soars up into the air such as it had died, shewing forth to
   men a most evident resurrection of the dead.  The Phoenix indeed is a
   wondrous bird, yet it is irrational, nor ever sang praise to God; it
   flies abroad through the sky, but it knows not who is the Only-begotten
   Son of God.  Has then a resurrection from the dead been given to this
   irrational creature which knows not its Maker, and to us who ascribe
   glory to God and keep His commandments, shall there no resurrection be
   granted?

   9.  But since the sign of the Phoenix is remote and uncommon, and men
   still disbelieve our resurrection, take again the proof of this from
   what thou seest every day.  A hundred or two hundred years ago, we all,
   speakers and hearers, where were we?  Know we not the groundwork of the
   substance of our bodies?  Knowest thou not how from weak and shapeless
   and simple [2259] elements we are engendered, and out of what is simple
   and weak a living man is formed? and how that weak element being made
   flesh is changed into strong sinews, and bright eyes, and sensitive
   nose, and hearing ears, and speaking tongue, and beating heart, and
   busy hands, and swift feet, and into members of all kinds [2260] ? and
   how that once weak element becomes a shipwright, and a builder, and an
   architect, and a craftsman of various arts, and a soldier, and a ruler,
   and a lawgiver, and a king?  Cannot God then, who has made us out of
   imperfect materials, raise us up when we have fallen into decay?  He
   who thus flames a body out of what is vile, cannot He raise the fallen
   body again?  And He who fashions that which is not, shall He not raise
   up that which is and is fallen?

   10.  Take further a manifest proof of the resurrection of the dead,
   witnessed month by month in the sky and its luminaries [2261] .  The
   body of the moon vanishes completely, so that no part of it is any more
   seen, yet it fills again, and is restored to its former state [2262] ;
   and for the perfect demonstration of the matter, the moon at certain
   revolutions of years suffering eclipse and becoming manifestly changed
   into blood, yet recovers its luminous body:  God having provided this,
   that thou also, the man who art formed of blood, mightest not refuse
   credence to the resurrection of the dead, but mightest believe
   concerning thyself also what thou seest in respect of the moon.  These
   therefore use thou as arguments against the Greeks; for with them who
   receive not what is written fight thou with unwritten weapons, by
   reasonings only and demonstrations; for these men know not who Moses
   is, nor Esaias, nor the Gospels, nor Paul.

   11.  Turn now to the Samaritans, who, receiving the Law only, allow not
   the Prophets.  To them the text just now read from Ezekiel appears of
   no force, for, as I said, they admit no Prophets; whence then shall we
   persuade the Samaritans also?  Let us go to the writings of the Law.
   Now God says to Moses, I am the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of
   Jacob [2263] ; this must mean of those who have being and subsistence.
   For if Abraham has come to an end, and Isaac and Jacob, then He is the
   God of those who have no being.  When did a king ever say, I am the
   king of soldiers, whom he had not?  When did any display wealth which
   he possessed not?  Therefore Abraham and Isaac and Jacob must subsist,
   that God may be the God of those who have being; for He said not, "I
   was their God," but I am.  And that there is a judgment, Abraham shews
   in saying to the Lord, He who judgeth all the earth, shall He not
   execute judgment [2264] ?

   12.  But to this the foolish Samaritans object again, and say that the
   souls possibly of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob continue, but that their
   bodies cannot possibly rise again.  Was it then possible that the rod
   of righteous Moses should become a serpent, and is it impossible that
   the bodies of the righteous should live and rise again?  And was that
   done contrary to nature, and shall they not be restored according to
   nature?  Again, the rod of Aaron, though cut off and dead, budded,
   without the scent of waters [2265] , and though under a roof, sprouted
   forth into blossoms as in the fields; and though set in dry places,
   yielded in one night the flowers and fruit of plants watered for many
   years.  Did Aaron's rod rise, as it were, from the dead, and shall not
   Aaron himself be raised?  And did God work wonders in wood, to secure
   to him the high-priesthood, and will He not vouchsafe a resurrection to
   Aaron himself?  A woman also was made salt contrary to nature; and
   flesh was turned into salt; and shall not flesh be restored to flesh?
   Was Lot's wife made a pillar of salt, and shall not Abraham's wife be
   raised again?  By what power was Moses' hand changed, which even within
   one hour became as snow, and was restored again?  Certainly by God's
   command.  Was then His command of force then, and has it no force now?

   13.  And whence in the beginning came man into being at all, O ye
   Samaritans, most senseless of all men?  Go to the first book of the
   Scripture, which even you receive; And God formed man of the dust of
   the ground [2266] .  Is dust transformed into flesh, and shall not
   flesh be again restored to flesh?  You must be asked too, whence the
   heavens had their being, and earth, and seas?  Whence sun, and moon,
   and stars?  How from the waters were made the things which fly and
   swim?  And how from earth all its living things?  Were so many myriads
   brought from nothing into being, and shall we men, who bear God's
   image, not be raised up?  Truly this course is full of unbelief, and
   the unbelievers are much to be condemned; when Abraham addresses the
   Lord as the Judge of all the earth, and the learners of the Law
   disbelieve; when it is written that man is of the earth, and the
   readers disbelieve it [2267] .

   14.  These questions, therefore, are for them, the unbelievers:  but
   the words of the Prophets are for us who believe.  But since some who
   have also used the Prophets believe not what is written, and allege
   against us that passage, The ungodly shall not rise up in judgment
   [2268] , and, For if man go down to the grave he shall come up no more
   [2269] , and, The dead shall not praise Thee, O Lord [2270] ,--for of
   what is well written, they have made ill use--it will be well in a
   cursory manner, and as far as is now possible, to meet them.  For if it
   is said, that the ungodly shall not rise up in judgment, this shews
   that they shall rise, not in judgment, but in condemnation; for God
   needs not long scrutiny, but close on the resurrection of the ungodly
   follows also their punishment.  And if it is said, The dead shall not
   praise Thee, O Lord, this shews, that since in this life only is the
   appointed time for repentance and pardon, for which they who enjoy it
   shall praise the Lord, it remains not after death for them who have
   died in sins to give praise as the receivers of a blessing, but to
   bewail themselves; for praise belongs to them who give thanks, but to
   them who are under the scourge, lamentation.  Therefore the just then
   offer praise; but they who have died in sins have no further season for
   confession [2271] .

   15.  And respecting that passage, If a man go down to the grave, he
   shall come up no more, observe what follows, for it is written, He
   shall come up no more, neither shall he return to his own house.  For
   since the whole world shall pass away, and every house shall be
   destroyed, how shall he return to his own house, there being henceforth
   a new and different earth?  But they ought to have heard Job, saying,
   For there is hope of a tree; for if it be cut down, it will sprout
   again, and the tender branch thereof will not cease.  For though the
   root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the
   rocky ground; yet from the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
   a crop like a new plant.  But man when he dies, is gone; and when
   mortal man falls, is he no more [2272] ?  As it were remonstrating and
   reproving (for thus ought we to read the words is no more with an
   interrogation [2273] ); he says since a tree falls and revives, shall
   not man, for whom all trees were made, himself revive?  And that thou
   mayest not suppose that I am forcing the words, read what follows; for
   after saying by way of question, When mortal man falls, is he no more?
   he says, For if a man die, he shall live again [2274] ; and immediately
   he adds, I will wait till I be made again [2275] ; and again elsewhere,
   Who shall raise up on the earth my skin, which endures these things
   [2276] .  And Esaias the Prophet says, The dead men shall rise again,
   and they that are in the tombs shall awake [2277] .  And the Prophet
   Ezekiel now before us, says most plainly, Behold I will open your
   graves, and bring you up out of your graves [2278] .  And Daniel says,
   Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to
   everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame [2279] .

   16.  And many Scriptures there are which testify of the Resurrection of
   the dead; for there are many other sayings on this matter.  But now, by
   way of remembrance only, we will make a passing mention of the raising
   of Lazarus on the fourth day; and just allude, because of the shortness
   of the time, to the widow's son also who was raised, and merely for the
   sake of reminding you, let me mention the ruler of the synagogue's
   daughter, and the rending of the rocks, and how there arose many bodies
   of the saints which slept [2280] , their graves having been opened.
   But specially be it remembered that Christ has been raised from the
   dead [2281] .  I speak but in passing of Elias, and the widow's son
   whom he raised; of Elisseus also, who raised the dead twice; once in
   his lifetime, and once after his death.  For when alive he wrought the
   resurrection by means of his own soul [2282] ; but that not the souls
   only of the just might be honoured, but that it might be believed that
   in the bodies also of the just there lies a power, the corpse which was
   cast into the sepulchre of Elisseus, when it touched the dead body of
   the prophet, was quickened, and the dead body of the prophet did the
   work of the soul, and that which was dead and buried gave life to the
   dead, and though it gave life, yet continued itself among the dead.
   Wherefore?  Lest if Elisseus should rise again, the work should be
   ascribed to his soul alone; and to shew, that even though the soul is
   not present, a virtue resides in the body of the saints, because of the
   righteous soul which has for so many years dwelt in it, and used it as
   its minister [2283] .  And let us not foolishly disbelieve, as though
   this thing had not happened:  for if handkerchiefs and aprons, which
   are from without, touching the bodies of the diseased, raised up the
   sick, how much more should the very body of the Prophet raise the dead?

   17.  And with respect to these instances we might say much, rehearsing
   in detail the marvellous circumstances of each event:  but as you have
   been already wearied both by the superposed fast of the Preparation
   [2284] , and by the watchings [2285] , let what has been cursorily
   spoken concerning them suffice for a while; these words having been as
   it were sown thinly, that you, receiving the seed like richest ground,
   may in bearing fruit increase them.  But be it remembered, that the
   Apostles also raised the dead; Peter raised Tabitha in Joppa, and Paul
   raised Eutychus in Troas; and thus did all the other Apostles, even
   though the wonders wrought by each have not all been written.  Further,
   remember all the sayings in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, which
   Paul wrote against them who said, How are the dead raised, and with
   what manner of body do they come [2286] ?  And how he says, For if the
   dead rise not, then is not Christ raised [2287] ; and how he called
   them fools [2288] , who believed not; and remember the whole of his
   teaching there concerning the resurrection of the dead, and how he
   wrote to the Thessalonians, But we would not have you to be ignorant,
   brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as
   the rest which have no hope [2289] , and all that follows:  but chiefly
   that, And the dead in Christ shall rise first [2290] .

   18.  But especially mark this, how very pointedly [2291] Paul says, For
   this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
   immortality [2292] .  For this body shall be raised not remaining weak
   as now; but raised the very same body, though by putting on
   incorruption it shall be fashioned anew [2293] ,--as iron blending with
   fire becomes fire, or rather as He knows how, the Lord who raises us.
   This body therefore shall be raised, but it shall abide not such as it
   now is, but an eternal body; no longer needing for its life such
   nourishment as now, nor stairs for its ascent, for it shall be made
   spiritual, a marvellous thing, such as we cannot worthily speak of.
   Then, it is said, shall the righteous shine forth as the sun [2294] ,
   and the moon, and as the brightness of the firmament [2295] .  And God,
   fore-knowing men's unbelief, has given to little worms in the summer to
   dart beams of light from their body [2296] , that from what is seen,
   that which is looked for might be believed; for He who gives in part is
   able to give the whole also, and He who made the worm radiant with
   light, will much more illuminate a righteous man.

   19.  We shall be raised therefore, all with our bodies eternal, but not
   all with bodies alike:  for if a man is righteous, he will receive a
   heavenly body, that he may be able worthily to hold converse with
   Angels; but if a man is a sinner, he shall receive an eternal body,
   fitted to endure the penalties of sins, that he may burn eternally in
   fire, nor ever be consumed [2297] .  And righteously will God assign
   this portion to either company; for we do nothing without the body.  We
   blaspheme with the mouth, and with the mouth we pray.  With the body we
   commit fornication, and with the body we keep chastity.  With the hand
   we rob, and by the hand we bestow alms; and the rest in like manner.
   Since then the body has been our minister in all things, it shall also
   share with us in the future the fruits of the past [2298] .

   20.  Therefore, brethren, let us be careful of our bodies, nor misuse
   them as though not our own.  Let us not say like the heretics, that
   this vesture of the body belongs not to us, but let us be careful of it
   as our own; for we must give account to the Lord of all things done
   through the body.  Say not, none seeth me; think not, that there is no
   witness of the deed.  Human witness oftentimes there is not; but He who
   fashioned us, an unerring witness, abides faithful in heaven [2299] ,
   and beholds what thou doest.  And the stains of sin also remain in the
   body; for as when a wound has gone deep into the body, even if there
   has been a healing, the scar remains, so sin wounds soul and body, and
   the marks of its scars remain in all; and they are removed only from
   those who receive the washing of Baptism.  The past wounds therefore of
   soul and body God heals by Baptism; against future ones let us one and
   all jointly guard ourselves, that we may keep this vestment of the body
   pure, and may not for practising fornication and sensual indulgence or
   any other sin for a short season, lose the salvation of heaven, but may
   inherit the eternal kingdom of God; of which may God, of His own grace,
   deem all of you worthy.

   21.  Thus much in proof of the Resurrection of the dead; and now, let
   me again recite to you the profession of the faith, and do you with all
   diligence pronounce it while I speak [2300] , and remember it.

   ______________________

   22.  The Faith which we rehearse contains in order the following, "And
   in one Baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; and in one Holy
   Catholic Church; and in the resurrection of the flesh; and in eternal
   life."  Now of Baptism and repentance I have spoken in the earliest
   Lectures; and my present remarks concerning the resurrection of the
   dead have been made with reference to the Article "In the resurrection
   of the flesh."  Now then let me finish what still remains to be said
   for the Article, "In one Holy Catholic Church," on which, though one
   might say many things, we will speak but briefly.

   23.  It is called Catholic then because it extends over all the world,
   from one end of the earth to the other; and because it teaches
   universally and completely one and all the doctrines which ought to
   come to men's knowledge, concerning things both visible and invisible,
   heavenly and earthly [2301] ; and because it brings into subjection to
   godliness the whole race of mankind, governors and governed, learned
   and unlearned; and because it universally treats and heals the whole
   class of sins, which are committed by soul or body, and possesses in
   itself every form of virtue which is named, both in deeds and words,
   and in every kind of spiritual gifts.

   24.  And it is rightly named (Ecclesia) because it calls forth [2302]
   and assembles together all men; according as the Lord says in
   Leviticus, And make an assembly for all the congregation at the door of
   the tabernacle of witness [2303] .  And it is to be noted, that the
   word assemble, is used for the first time in the Scriptures here, at
   the time when the Lord puts Aaron into the High-priesthood.  And in
   Deuteronomy also the Lord says to Moses, Assemble the people unto Me,
   and let them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me [2304] .
   And he again mentions the name of the Church, when he says concerning
   the Tables, And on them were written all the words which the Lord spake
   with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the
   Assembly [2305] ; as if he had said more plainly, in the day in which
   ye were called and gathered together by God.  The Psalmist also says, I
   will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, in the great Congregation; I will
   praise Thee among much people [2306] .

   25.  Of old the Psalmist sang, Bless ye God in the congregations, even
   the Lord, (ye that are) from the fountains of Israel [2307] .  But
   after the Jews for the plots which they made against the Saviour were
   cast away from His grace, the Saviour built out of the Gentiles a
   second Holy Church, the Church of us Christians, concerning which he
   said to Peter, And upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates
   of hell shall not prevail against it [2308] .  And David prophesying of
   both these, said plainly of the first which was rejected, I have hated
   the Congregation of evil doers [2309] ; but of the second which is
   built up he says in the same Psalm, Lord, I have loved the beauty of
   Thine house [2310] ; and immediately afterwards, In the Congregations
   will I bless thee, O Lord [2311] .  For now that the one Church in
   Judæa is cast off, the Churches of Christ are increased over all the
   world; and of them it is said in the Psalms, Sing unto the Lord a new
   song, His praise in the Congregation of Saints [2312] .  Agreeably to
   which the prophet also said to the Jews, I have no pleasure in you,
   saith the Lord Almighty [2313] ; and immediately afterwards, For from
   the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, My name is
   glorified among the Gentiles [2314] .  Concerning this Holy Catholic
   Church Paul writes to Timothy, That thou mayest know how thou oughtest
   to behave thyself in the House of God, which is the Church of the
   Living God, the pillar and ground of the truth [2315] .

   26.  But since the word Ecclesia is applied to different things (as
   also it is written of the multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians,
   And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly [2316] ), and
   since one might properly and truly say that there is a Church of evil
   doers, I mean the meetings of the heretics, the Marcionists and
   Manichees, and the rest, for this cause the Faith has securely
   delivered to thee now the Article, "And in one Holy Catholic Church;"
   that thou mayest avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the
   Holy Church Catholic in which thou wast regenerated.  And if ever thou
   art sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is
   (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens
   houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the
   Catholic Church.  For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church,
   the mother of us all, which is the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Only-begotten Son of God (for it is written, As Christ also loved the
   Church and gave Himself for it [2317] , and all the rest,) and is a
   figure and copy of Jerusalem which is above, which is free, and the
   mother of us all [2318] ; which before was barren, but now has many
   children.

   27.  For when the first Church was cast off, in the second, which is
   the Catholic Church, God hath set, as Paul says, first Apostles,
   secondly Prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of
   healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues [2319] , and
   every sort of virtue, I mean wisdom and understanding, temperance and
   justice, mercy and loving-kindness, and patience unconquerable in
   persecutions.  She, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand
   and on the left, by honour and dishonour [2320] , in former days amid
   persecutions and tribulations crowned the holy martyrs with the varied
   and blooming chaplets of patience, and now in times of peace by God's
   grace receives her due honours from kings and those who are in high
   place [2321] , and from every sort and kindred of men.  And while the
   kings of particular nations have bounds set to their authority, the
   Holy Church Catholic alone extends her power without limit over the
   whole world; for God, as it is written, hath made her border peace
   [2322] .  But I should need many more hours for my discourse, if I
   wished to speak of all things which concern her.

   ______________________

   28.  In this Holy Catholic Church receiving instruction and behaving
   ourselves virtuously, we shall attain the kingdom of heaven, and
   inherit eternal life; for which also we endure all toils, that we may
   be made partakers thereof from the Lord.  For ours is no trifling aim,
   but our endeavour is for eternal life.  Wherefore in the profession of
   the Faith, after the words, "And in the resurrection of the flesh,"
   that is, of the dead (of which we have discoursed), we are taught to
   believe also "in the life eternal," for which as Christians we are
   striving.

   29.  The real and true life then is the Father, who through the Son in
   the Holy Spirit pours forth as from a fountain His heavenly gifts to
   all; and through His love to man, the blessings of the life eternal are
   promised without fail to us men also.  We must not disbelieve the
   possibility of this, but having an eye not to our own weakness but to
   His power, we must believe; for with God all things are possible.  And
   that this is possible, and that we may look for eternal life, Daniel
   declares, And of the many righteous shall they shine as the stars for
   ever and ever [2323] .  And Paul says, And so shall we be ever with the
   Lord [2324] :  for the being for ever with the Lord implies the life
   eternal.  But most plainly of all the Saviour Himself says in the
   Gospel, And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the
   righteous into life eternal [2325] .

   30.  And many are the proofs concerning the life eternal.  And when we
   desire to gain this eternal life, the sacred Scriptures suggest to us
   the ways of gaining it; of which, because of the length of our
   discourse, the texts we now set before you shall be but few, the rest
   being left to the search of the diligent.  They declare at one time
   that it is by faith; for it is written, He that believeth on the Son
   hath eternal life [2326] , and what follows; and again He says Himself,
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and believeth
   Him that sent Me, hath eternal life [2327] , and the rest.  At another
   time, it is by the preaching of the Gospel; for He says, that He that
   reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal [2328]
   .  At another time, by martyrdom and confession in Christ's name; for
   He says, And he that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto
   life eternal [2329] .  And again, by preferring Christ to riches or
   kindred; And every one that hath forsaken brethren, or sisters [2330] ,
   and the rest, shall inherit eternal life.  Moreover it is by keeping
   the commandments, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill
   [2331] , and the rest which follow; as He answered to him that came to
   Him, and said, Good Master, what shall I do that I may have eternal
   life [2332] ?  But further, it is by departing from evil works, and
   henceforth serving God; for Paul says, But now being made free from
   sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
   sanctification, and the end eternal life [2333] .

   31.  And the ways of finding eternal life are many, though I have
   passed over them by reason of their number.  For the Lord in His
   loving-kindness has opened, not one or two only, but many doors, by
   which to enter into the life eternal, that, as far as lay in Him, all
   might enjoy it without hindrance.  Thus much have we for the present
   spoken within compass concerning the life eternal, which is the last
   doctrine of those professed in the Faith, and its termination; which
   life may we all, both teachers and hearers, by God's grace enjoy!

   ______________________

   32.  And now, brethren beloved, the word of instruction exhorts you
   all, to prepare your souls for the reception of the heavenly gifts.  As
   regards the Holy and Apostolic Faith delivered to you to profess, we
   have spoken through the grace of the Lord as many Lectures, as was
   possible, in these past days of Lent; not that this is all we ought to
   have said, for many are the points omitted; and these perchance are
   thought out better by more excellent teachers.  But now the holy day of
   the Passover is at hand, and ye, beloved [2334] in Christ, are to be
   enlightened by the Laver of regeneration.  Ye shall therefore again be
   taught what is requisite, if God so will; with how great devotion and
   order you must enter in when summoned, for what purpose each of the
   holy mysteries of Baptism is performed, and with what reverence and
   order you must go from Baptism to the Holy Altar of God, and enjoy its
   spiritual and heavenly mysteries; that your souls being previously
   enlightened by the word of doctrine, ye may discover in each particular
   the greatness of the gifts bestowed on you by God.

   33.  And after Easter's Holy Day of salvation, ye shall come on each
   successive day, beginning from the second day of the week, after the
   assembly into the Holy Place of the Resurrection [2335] , and there, if
   God permit, ye shall hear other Lectures; in which ye shall again be
   taught the reasons of every thing which has been done, and shall
   receive the proofs thereof from the Old and New Testaments,--first, of
   the things done just before Baptism,--next, how ye were cleansed from
   your sins by the Lord, by the washing of water with the word [2336]
   ,--and how like Priests ye have become partakers of the Name of
   Christ,--and how the Seal of the fellowship of the Holy Ghost was given
   to you,--and concerning the mysteries at the Altar of the New
   Testament, which have taken their beginning from this place, both what
   the Divine Scriptures have delivered to us, and what is the power of
   these mysteries, and how ye must approach them, and when and how
   receive them;--and at the end of all, how for the time to come ye must
   behave yourselves worthily of this grace both in words and deeds, that
   you may all be enabled to enjoy the life everlasting.  And these things
   shall be spoken, if it be God's pleasure.

   34.  Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord alway; again I will say,
   Rejoice:  for your redemption hath drawn nigh [2337] , and the heavenly
   host of the Angels is waiting for your salvation.  And there is now the
   voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord
   [2338] ; and the Prophet cries, Ho, ye that thirst, come ye to the
   water [2339] ; and immediately afterwards, Hearken unto me, and ye
   shall eat that which is good, and your soul shall delight itself in
   good things [2340] .  And within a little while ye shall hear that
   excellent lesson which says, Shine, shine, O thou new Jerusalem; for
   thy light is come [2341] .  Of this Jerusalem the prophet hath said,
   And afterwards thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, Zion,
   the faithful mother of cities [2342] ; because of the law which went
   forth out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem [2343] ,
   which word has from hence been showered forth on the whole world.  To
   her the Prophet also says concerning you, Lift up thine eyes round
   about, and behold thy children gathered together [2344] ; and she
   answers, saying, Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as doves with
   their young ones to me [2345] ? (clouds because of their spiritual
   nature, and doves, from their purity).  And again, she says, Who
   knoweth such things? or who hath seen it thus? did ever a land bring
   forth in one day? or was ever a nation born all at once? for as soon as
   Zion travailed, she brought forth her children [2346] .  And all things
   shall be filled with joy unspeakable because of the Lord who said,
   Behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy [2347] .

   35.  And may these words be spoken now again over you also, Sing, O
   heavens, and be joyful, O earth; and then; for the Lord hath had mercy
   on His people, and comforted the lowly of His people [2348] .  And this
   shall come to pass through the loving-kindness of God, who says to you,
   Behold, I will blot out as a cloud thy transgressions, and as a thick
   cloud thy sins [2349] .  But ye who have been counted worthy of the
   name of Faithful (of whom it is written, Upon My servants shall be
   called a new name which shall be blessed on the earth [2350] ,) ye
   shall say with gladness, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the
   heavenly places in Christ [2351] :  in whom we have our redemption
   through His blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the riches
   of His grace, wherein He abounded towards us [2352] , and what follows;
   and again, But God being rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He
   loved us, when we were dead through our trespasses, quickened us
   together with Christ [2353] , and the rest.  And again in like manner
   praise ye the Lord of all good things, saying, But when the kindness of
   God our Saviour, and His love towards man appeared, not by works of
   righteousness which we had done, but according to His mercy He saved
   us, through the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost, which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
   that being justified by His grace, we might be made heirs, according to
   hope, of eternal life [2354] .  And may God Himself the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, give unto you a spirit of
   wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Himself, the eyes of your
   understanding being enlightened [2355] , and may He ever keep you in
   good works, and words, and thoughts; to Whom be glory, honour, and
   power, through our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, now and
   ever, and unto all the endless ages of eternity.  Amen [2356] .

   [2243] Tertull. De Resurr. carnis, cap. 2:  "They acknowledge a
   half-resurrection, to wit of the soul only."  Compare Iren. I. xxiii.
   5, on Menander's assertion that his disciples attain to the
   resurrection by being baptized into him, and can die no more, but
   retain immortal youth:  ib. xxiv. 5.  Basilides taught that "salvation
   belongs to the soul alone."  On the other forms of heresy concerning
   the Resurrection, see Suicer, Thesaurus, 'Anastasis.

   [2244] The objections noticed in § 2 are discussed by Athenagoras, De
   Resurr. capp. ii., iv.--viii.; Tatian. Or. ad Græcos, cap. vi.,

   made at their first formation the bodies of men, and their original
   elements, He will, when they are dissolved, in whatever manner that may
   take place, raise them again with equal ease."  Lactant. Institt. VII.
   23 fin.:  Apost. Const. V. 7.

   [2250] An eloquent statement of the argument for the resurrection from
   the analogies of nature occurs in Tertull. De Resurr. c. xii.  That it
   was not unknown to Cyril, seems probable from the concluding sentence:
   "And surely if all things rise again for man, for whom they have been
   provided--but not for man unless for his flesh also--how can the flesh
   itself perish utterly, for the sake and service of which nothing is
   allowed to perish."  Tertullian himself was probably indebted, as Bp.
   Lightfoot suggests, to Clemens. Rom. Epist. ad Corinth. xxiv.  Cf.
   Lactant. Div. Inst. vii. 4.

   [2251] Cf. Cat. iv. 30.  These passages shew that the Lectures were
   delivered in a year when Easter fell early, as was the case in 348 a.d.

   [2252] In such cases there is, of course, no actual death.

   [2253] The muoxos is supposed by the Benedictine Editor to be the toad
   ("Inventusque cavis bufo," Virg. Georg. i. 185), by others the marmot
   (mus Alpinus).  More probably it is the dormouse (myoxis glis), which
   stores up provisions for the winter, though it sleeps through much of
   that season.

   [2254] The story of the Phoenix as told by Herodotus, II. 73, is as
   follows:  "They have also another sacred bird called the Phoenix, which
   I myself have never seen, except in pictures.  Indeed it is a great
   rarity even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of
   the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old
   phoenix dies....They tell a story of what this bird does, which does
   not seem to me to be credible; that he comes all the way from Arabia,
   and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the
   temple of the Sun, and there buries the body." The many variations and
   fabulous accretions of the story are detailed by Suicer, Thesaurus,
   Phoinix, and by Bp. Lightfoot in a long and interesting note on Clemens
   Rom. Epist. ad Cor. xxv.  Cyril borrows the story from Clement almost
   verbally, yet not without some variations, which will be noticed
   below.  The legend with all its miraculous features is told by Ovid,
   Metamorph. xv. 392, by Claudian, Phoenix, and by the Pseudo-Lactantius
   in an Elegiac poem, Phoenix, included in Weber's Corpus Poetarum
   Latinorum, and literally translated in Clark's Ante-Nicene Library.

   they say is without a mate, and the only one in the creation."
   Pseudo-Lactant. v. 30. "Hoc nemus hos lucos avis incolit unica,
   phoenix, Unica, sed vivit morte refecta suâ"

   [2256] "By day, in the sight of all" (Clem. R.)  The city was
   Heliopolis, according to Herodotus and the other ancient authors.  But
   Milton, Paradise Lost, V. 272-- A phoenix gaz'd by all, as that sole
   bird, When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's Bright temple to
   Ægyptian Thebes he flies.' Why does Milton despatch his bird to Thebes
   rather than Heliopolis?" (Lightfoot).

   [2258] The mode of reproduction in bees was regarded by Aristotle as
   mysterious, having in it something supernatural (theion):  De
   Generatione Animal. III. 10. 1, 27.  In the story of the phoenix
   Herodotus makes no mention of the "worm."

   [2260] For a similar argument, see Lactant. De Resurr. c xvii.

   [2261] Clem. Rom. Epist. ad Cor. xxiv:  "Day and night shew unto us the
   resurrection.  The night falleth asleep, and day ariseth; the day
   departeth, and night cometh on."

   [2262] Tertull. de Resurr. Carnis, xii.:  "Readorned also are the
   mirrors of the moon, which her monthly course had worn away."..."The
   whole of this revolving order of things bears witness to the
   resurrection of the dead."

   [2267] The anomalous construction hotan gegraptai ....kai apistosin may
   be explained by the consideration, that the uncertainty expressed in
   hotan attaches only to the latter Verb.  See Winer's Grammar of N.T.

   and prayer for the dead see note on xxiii. 10.

   [2272] Job xiv. 7-10.

   [2273] There is no indication of a question in the Septuagint version
   of the passage, which means in the Hebrew, and where is he? (A.V. and
   R.V.):  Vulg. ubi, quæso, est?

   [2274] Job xiv. 14:  For if a man die, shall he live again? (A.V. and
   R.V.).  By omitting the interrogation here, and inserting it above in
   v. 10, Cyril exactly inverts the meaning.

   [2275] Ib. v. 14:  (A.V.) All the days of my appointed time (R.V. of my
   warfare) will I wait, till my change (R.V. release) come.

   [2276] Job xix. 26:  (R.V.) and that he shall stand up at the last upon
   the earth:  and after my skin hath been thus destroyed, &c.  Cyril, as
   usual, follows the Septuagint.

   [2283] "The worship of relics, and the belief in them as remedies and a
   protection against evil, originated in the 4th century.  They first (?)
   appear in writings, none of which are earlier than the year 370:  but
   they prevailed rapidly when they had once taken root" (Scudamore, Dict.
   Chr. Antiq. "Relics," p. 1770).  Bingham (Ant. xxiii. 4, § 7) quotes a
   law of Theodosius, "that no one should remove any dead body that was
   buried, from one place to another; that no one should sell or buy the
   relics of Martyrs:  but if any one was minded to build over the grave
   where a martyr was buried, a church to be called a martyrium, in
   respect to him, he should have liberty to do it."  The law wholly
   failed to suppress a superstition which was sanctioned by such men as
   Cyril, Basil, Chrysostom, Ambrose, and Augustine.

   [2284] ek tes hupertheseos tes nesteias tes paraskeues, Ed. Bened.
   "The ecclesiastical term tes hupertheseos we have rendered, according
   to the interpretation received among the Latins, by the word
   superpositio.'  The ancients meant by it a fast continued for two or
   three days without food.  Moreover, since the great week was observed
   with severer fastings, there were many who passed either the whole week
   or four, three, or two days, namely the Preparation and the Holy
   Sabbath (Easter Eve), entirely fasting as is testified by S. Irenæus
   (Euseb. Hist. V. 24) and others.  The continuance of the fast
   throughout the Friday and Saturday was highly approved, as may be seen
   from the Apostolical Constitutions, V. 18."  The passage referred to is
   as follows:  "Do you therefore fast on the days of the Passover,
   beginning from the second day of the week until the Preparation and the
   Sabbath, six days, making use only of bread, and salt, and herbs, and
   water for your drink:  but abstain on these days from wine and flesh,
   for they are days of lamentation and not of fasting.  Do ye who are
   able fast throughout the Preparation and the Sabbath entirely, tasting
   nothing till the cockcrowing at night; but if any one is not able to
   combine them both, let the Sabbath at least be observed."

   [2285] The fast of the Great Sabbath was to be continued through the
   night, as prescribed in the Apost. Const. V. 19:  "Continue until
   cock-crowing and break off your fast at dawn of the first day of the
   week, which is the Lord's day, keeping awake from evening until
   cock-crowing:  and assembling together in the Church, watch and pray
   and beseech God, in your night-long vigil, reading the Law, the
   Prophets, and the Psalms, until the crowing of the cocks:  and after
   baptizing your Catechumens, and reading the Gospel in fear and
   trembling, and speaking to the people the things pertaining to
   salvation, so cease from your mourning."  A chief reason for the
   watching was that Christ was expected to return at the same hour in
   which He rose.  On the meaning of "superposition" see Routh's note on
   the Synodical Epistle of Irenæus to Victor of Rome (Rell. Sac. ii. p.
   45, ss.), and the passage of Dionysius of Alexandria there quoted.

   [2301] Bishop Lightfoot (Ignatius, ad Smyrnæos, viii.) traces the
   original and later senses of the word "Catholic" very fully.  "In its
   earliest usages, therefore, as a fluctuating epithet of ekklesia,
   catholic' means universal,' as opposed to individual,' particular.'  In
   its later sense, as a fixed attribute, it implies orthodoxy as opposed
   to heresy, conformity as opposed to dissent."  Commenting on this
   passage of Cyril, the Bishop adds that "these two latter reasons, that
   it (the Church) is comprehensive in doctrine, and that it is universal
   in application, can only be regarded as secondary glosses."

   of all kinds, by the grace of God.  The year 352 according to the

   THE saME aUTHOR,

   TO THE nEWLY bAPTIZED [2357] .

   ------------------------

   Lecture XIX.

   First Lecture on the Mysteries.

   With a Lesson from the First General Epistle of Peter, beginning at Be
   sober, be vigilant, to the end of the Epistle.

   1.  I have long been wishing, O true-born and dearly beloved children
   of the Church, to discourse to you concerning these spiritual and
   heavenly Mysteries; but since I well knew that seeing is far more
   persuasive than hearing, I waited for the present season; that finding
   you more open to the influence of my words from your present
   experience, I might lead you by the hand into the brighter and more
   fragrant meadow of the Paradise before us; especially as ye have been
   made fit to receive the more sacred Mysteries, after having been found
   worthy of divine and life-giving Baptism [2358] .  Since therefore it
   remains to set before you a table of the more perfect instructions, let
   us now teach you these things exactly, that ye may know the effect
   [2359] wrought upon you on that evening of your baptism.

   2.  First ye entered into the vestibule [2360] of the Baptistery, and
   there facing towards the West ye listened to the command to stretch
   forth your hand, and as in the presence of Satan ye renounced him.  Now
   ye must know that this figure is found in ancient history.  For when
   Pharaoh, that most bitter and cruel tyrant, was oppressing the free and
   high-born people of the Hebrews, God sent Moses to bring them out of
   the evil bondage of the Egyptians.  Then the door posts were anointed
   with the blood of a lamb, that the destroyer might flee from the houses
   which had the sign of the blood; and the Hebrew people was marvellously
   delivered.  The enemy, however, after their rescue, pursued after them
   [2361] , and saw the sea wondrously parted for them; nevertheless he
   went on, following close in their footsteps, and was all at once
   overwhelmed and engulphed in the Red Sea.

   3.  Now turn from the old to the new, from the figure to the reality.
   There we have Moses sent from God to Egypt; here, Christ, sent forth
   from His Father into the world:  there, that Moses might lead forth an
   afflicted people out of Egypt; here, that Christ might rescue those who
   are oppressed in the world under sin:  there, the blood of a lamb was
   the spell against [2362] the destroyer; here, the blood of the Lamb
   without blemish Jesus Christ is made the charm to scare [2363] evil
   spirits:  there, the tyrant was pursuing that ancient people even to
   the sea; and here the daring and shameless spirit, the author of evil,
   was following thee even to the very streams of salvation.  The tyrant
   of old was drowned in the sea; and this present one disappears in the
   water of salvation.

   4.  But nevertheless thou art bidden to say, with arm outstretched
   towards him as though he were present, "I renounce thee, Satan."  I
   wish also to say wherefore ye stand facing to the West; for it is
   necessary.  Since the West is the region of sensible darkness, and he
   being darkness has his dominion also in darkness, therefore, looking
   with a symbolical meaning towards the West, ye renounce that dark and
   gloomy potentate.  What then did each of you stand up and say?  "I
   renounce thee, Satan,"--thou wicked and most cruel tyrant! meaning, "I
   fear thy might no longer; for that Christ hath overthrown, having
   partaken with me of flesh and blood, that through these He might by
   death destroy death [2364] , that I might not be made subject to
   bondage for ever."  "I renounce thee,"--thou crafty and most subtle
   serpent.  "I renounce thee,"--plotter as thou art, who under the guise
   of friendship didst contrive all disobedience, and work apostasy in our
   first parents.  "I renounce thee, Satan,"--the artificer and abettor of
   all wickedness.

   5.  Then in a second sentence thou art taught to say, "and all thy
   works."  Now the works of Satan are all sin, which also thou must
   renounce;--just as one who has escaped a tyrant has surely escaped his
   weapons also.  All sin therefore, of every kind, is included in the
   works of the devil.  Only know this; that all that thou sayest,
   especially at that most thrilling hour, is written in God's books; when
   therefore thou doest any thing contrary to these promises, thou shalt
   be judged as a transgressor [2365] .  Thou renouncest therefore the
   works of Satan; I mean, all deeds and thoughts which are contrary to
   reason.

   6.  Then thou sayest, "And all his pomp [2366] ."  Now the pomp of the
   devil is the madness of theatres [2367] , and horse-races, and hunting,
   and all such vanity:  from which that holy man praying to be delivered
   says unto God, Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity [2368] .  Be
   not interested in the madness of the theatre, where thou wilt behold
   the wanton gestures of the players [2369] , carried on with mockeries
   and all unseemliness, and the frantic dancing of effeminate men [2370]
   ;--nor in the madness of them who in hunts [2371] expose themselves to
   wild beasts, that they may pamper their miserable appetite; who, to
   serve their belly with meats, become themselves in reality meat for the
   belly of untamed beasts; and to speak justly, for the sake of their own
   god, their belly, they cast away their life headlong in single combats
   [2372] .  Shun also horse-races, that frantic and soul-subverting
   spectacle [2373] .  For all these are the pomp of the devil.

   7.  Moreover, the things which are hung up at idol festivals [2374] ,
   either meat or bread, or other such things polluted by the invocation
   of the unclean spirits, are reckoned in the pomp of the devil.  For as
   the Bread and Wine of the Eucharist before the invocation of the Holy
   and Adorable Trinity were simple bread and wine, while after the
   invocation the Bread becomes the Body of Christ, and the Wine the Blood
   of Christ [2375] , so in like manner such meats belonging to the pomp
   of Satan, though in their own nature simple, become profane by the
   invocation of the evil spirit.

   8.  After this thou sayest, "and all thy service [2376] ."  Now the
   service of the devil is prayer in idol temples; things done in honour
   of lifeless idols; the lighting of lamps [2377] , or burning of incense
   by fountains or rivers [2378] , as some persons cheated by dreams or by
   evil spirits do [resort to this [2379] ], thinking to find a cure even
   for their bodily ailments.  Go not after such things.  The watching of
   birds, divination, omens, or amulets, or charms written on leaves,
   sorceries, or other evil arts [2380] , and all such things, are
   services of the devil; therefore shun them.  For if after renouncing
   Satan and associating thyself with Christ [2381] , thou fall under
   their influence, thou shalt find [2382] the tyrant more bitter;
   perchance, because he treated thee of old as his own, and relieved thee
   from his hard bondage, but has now been greatly exasperated by thee; so
   thou wilt be bereaved of Christ, and have experience of the other.
   Hast thou not heard the old history which tells us of Lot and his
   daughters?  Was not he himself saved with his daughters, when he had
   gained the mountain, while his wife became a pillar of salt, set up as
   a monument for ever, in remembrance of her depraved will and her
   turning back.  Take heed therefore to thyself, and turn not again to
   what is behind [2383] , having put thine hand to the plough, and then
   turning back to the salt savour of this life's doings; but escape to
   the mountain, to Jesus Christ, that stone hewn without hands [2384] ,
   which has filled the world.

   9.  When therefore thou renouncest Satan, utterly breaking all thy
   covenant with him, that ancient league with hell [2385] , there is
   opened to thee the paradise of God, which He planted towards the East,
   whence for his transgression our first father was banished; and a
   symbol of this was thy turning from West to East, the place of light
   [2386] .  Then thou wert told to say, "I believe in the Father, and in
   the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and in one Baptism of repentance [2387]
   ."  Of which things we spoke to thee at length in the former Lectures,
   as God's grace allowed us.

   10.  Guarded therefore by these discourses, be sober.  For our
   adversary the devil, as was just now read, as a roaring lion, walketh
   about, seeking whom he may devour [2388] .  But though in former times
   death was mighty and devoured, at the holy Laver of regeneration God
   has wiped away every tear from off all faces [2389] .  For thou shalt
   no more mourn, now that thou hast put off the old man; but thou shalt
   keep holy-day [2390] , clothed in the garment of salvation [2391] ,
   even Jesus Christ.

   11.  And these things were done in the outer chamber.  But if God will,
   when in the succeeding lectures on the Mysteries we have entered into
   the Holy of Holies [2392] , we shall there know the symbolical meaning
   of the things which are there performed.  Now to God the Father, with
   the Son and the Holy Ghost, be glory, and power, and majesty, forever
   and ever.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2357] This general title of the five following Lectures is omitted in
   many mss.  "In Cod. Ottob. at the end of the special title of this
   first Mystagogic Lecture, after the words "to the end of the Epistle,"
   there follows the statement "Of the same author Cyril, and of John the
   Bishop" (Bened. Ed.).  See Index, Authenticity.

   [2358] This Lecture was delivered on the Monday after Easter in the
   Holy Sepulchre:  see Cat. xviii. 33.

   [2359] ten emphasin ten....gegenemenen , is found in all the mss.
   "Nevertheless it would seem that we ought to read ton....gegenemenon,
   which Grodecq either read or substituted" (Ben. Ed.).  With the
   proposed reading the meaning would be--"the significance of the things
   done to you," which agrees better with the meaning of emphasis.

   [2360] thon proaulion, called below in § 11 "the outer chamber."  Cf.
   Procat. § 1, note 3.  It appears from Tertullian, De Corona, § 3, that
   the renunciation was made first in the Church, and afterwards in the
   Baptistery:  "When we are going to enter the water, at that moment as
   well as just before in the Church under the hand of the President, we
   solemnly profess that we disown the devil, and his pomp, and his
   angels."

   [2361] Ex. xiv. 9, 23.

   [2362] apotropaion

   [2363] phugadeuterion, the word commonly used in the Septuagint for "a
   city of refuge."  But the Verb phugadeuo is Transitive in 2 Macc. ix.
   4, as well as in Xenophon and Demosthenes.  The application of the
   blood of Christ in Baptism is represented by marking the sign of the
   Cross on the forehead.  Compare the lines of Prudentius quoted by the
   Benedictine Editor: "Passio quæ nostram defendit sanguine frontem,
   Corporeamque domum signato collinit ore."

   [2364] Heb. ii. 14, 15.

   [2365] Gal. ii. 18.

   [2366] Herod. II. 58:  "The Egyptians were the first to introduce
   solemn assemblies (paneguris) and processions (pompas)."  At Rome the
   term "pompa" was applied especially to the procession with which the
   Ludi Circenses were opened and also to any grand ceremony or pageant.

   [2367] theatromaniai.  Cf. Tertull. Apologet. 38; "We renounce all your
   spectacles....Among us nothing is ever said, or seen, or heard, which
   has anything in common with the madness of the Circus, the immodesty of
   the theatre, the atrocities of the arena, the useless exercises of the
   wrestling-ground."  He calls the theatre "that citadel of all
   impurities," De Spectaculis, c. 10, "immodesty's peculiar abode," c.
   17, and gives a vivid description of the rage and fury of the Circus in
   c. 16.

   [2368] Ps. cxix. 37.

   [2369] mimon, the name either of a species of low comedy, "consisting
   more of gestures and mimicry than of spoken dialogue," or of the
   persons who acted in them.  Cyril's description of the coarse and
   indecent character of the mimes is more than justified by the impartial
   testimony of Ovid, Trist. ii. 497: "Quid si scripsissem mimos obscoena
   jocantes, Qui semper vetiti crimen amoris habent; In quibus assidue
   cultus procedit adulter, Verbaque dat stulto callida nupta viro.
   Nubilis hos virgo, matronaque, virque, puerque Spectat, et e magna
   parte Senatus adest. Nec satis incestis temerari vocibus aures;
   Assuescunt oculi multa pudenda pati." A theatre is mentioned as one of
   the buildings erected by Hadrian in his new City Aelia Capitolina built
   on the site of Jerusalem; and that theatrical performances were
   continued in the time of Cyril we know from the accusation that in a
   time of famine he had sold one of the Church vestments, which was
   afterwards used upon the stage.

   [2370] Lactantius, Epitome, § 63:  "Histrionici etiam impudici gestus,
   quibus infames foeminas imitantur, libidines, quæ saltando exprimunt,
   docent."

   [2371] kunegesiais, the so-called "venationes" of the Circus in which
   the "bestiarii" fought with wild beasts.

   [2372] The "bestiarii" were feasted in public on the day before their
   encounter with the beasts.  See Tertull. Apologet. § 42:  "I do not
   recline in public at the feast of Bacchus, after the manner of the
   beast-fighters at their last banquet."  Ib. § 9:  "Those also who dine
   on the flesh of wild beasts from the arena, who have keen appetites for
   bear and stag."  These latter, however, were chiefly the poor, to whom
   flesh was a rarity:  Apuleius Metam. iv. 14, quoted by Oehler.

   [2373] psuchas ektrachelizon, an allusion to the risk of a broken neck
   in the chariot-race.  Tertull. de Spectaculis, § 9:  "Equestrianism was
   formerly practised in a simple way on horseback, and certainly its
   ordinary use was innocent:  but when it was dragged into the games, it
   passed from a gift of God into the service of demons."  The presiding
   deity of the chariot-race was Poseidon (Hom. Il. xxiii, 307; Pind. Ol.
   i. 63; Pyth. vi. 50; Soph. OEdip. Col. 712), and both this and the
   other shows of the Circus, and of the theatre, were connected with the
   worship of the gods of Greece and Rome, and therefore forbidden as
   idolatrous:  "What high religious rites, what sacrifices precede,
   intervene, and follow, how many guilds, how many priesthoods, how many
   services are set astir" (Tert. de Spect. § 7).

   [2374] paneguresi.  The Panegyris was strictly a religious festival,
   but was commonly accompanied by a great fair or market, in which were
   sold not only such things as the worshippers might need for their
   offerings, e.g. frankincense, but also the flesh of the animals which
   had been sacrificed.  Cf. Dictionary of Greek and Rom. Antiq.
   "Panegyris."  Tertull. Apolog. § 42:  "We do not go to your
   spectacles:  yet the articles that are sold there, if I need them, I
   shall obtain more readily at their proper places.  We certainly buy no
   frankincense."

   [2375] Compare St. Paul's argument against meats offered to idols, 1
   Cor. x. 14-21:  and on Cyril's Eucharistic doctrine, see notes on Cat.
   xxii.

   [2376] The form of renunciation before Baptism is given in the
   Apostolic Constitutions, VII. 41:  "I renounce Satan, and his works,
   and his pomps, and his services, and his angels, and his inventions,
   and all things that are under him."  Cf. Tertull. De Spectaculis, § 4:
   "When on entering the water, we make profession of the Christian faith
   in the words of its rule, we bear public testimony that we have
   renounced the devil, his pomp, and his angels."

   [2377] Herod. ii. 62:  "At Sais, when the assembly takes place for the
   sacrifices (to Minerva, or Neith), there is one night on which the
   inhabitants all burn a multitude of lights in the open air round their
   houses....These burn the whole night, and give to the festival the name
   of the Feast of Lamps (Luchnokaie)."

   [2378] Fountains and rivers had each its own deity or nymph, to whom
   sacrifices were offered, and incense burned.

   [2379] es touto diebesan.  These words are omitted in many mss., and
   regarded by the Benedictine Editor as a spurious addition made to
   complete the construction.  The words e toiauta at the end of the
   sentence are better omitted, as in several good mss.

   [2380] Cat. iv. 37; Apost. Const. vi.:  "Be not a diviner, for that
   leads to idolatry....Thou shalt not use enchantments or purgations for
   thy child.  Thou shalt not be a soothsayer nor a diviner by great or
   little birds.  Nor shalt thou learn wicked arts; for all these things
   has the Law forbidden."  Deut. xviii. 10, 11.

   [2381] Apost. Const. vii. 41:  "And after his renunciation let him in
   his association (suntassomenos) say, I associate myself with Christ."

   [2382] peirathese (Cod. Mon. 1) is a better reading than peirasthese.
   Cf. Plat. Laches, 188 E:  ton ergon epeirathen.

   [2383] Phil. iii. 13.  On the pillar of salt, see Wisd. x. 7:  "Of
   whose wickedness even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a
   testimony,...and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an
   unbelieving soul."  Joseph. Ant. I. xi. 4:  "Moreover I have seen it,
   for it remains even unto this day."  Bp. Lightfoot, Clem. Rom. Ep. ad
   Cor. xi. remarks that the region abounds in pillars of salt, and
   "Mediæval and even modern travellers have delighted to identify one or
   other of these with Lot's wife."

   [2384] Dan. ii. 35, 45.

   [2385] Is. xxviii. 15.

   [2386] Cf. S. Ambros. De Mysteriis, c. ii. 7:  "Ad orientem
   converteris; qui enim renunciat diabolo ad Christum convertitur:"
   "Where he plainly intimates....that turning to the East was a symbol of
   their aversion from Satan and conversion unto Christ, that is, from
   darkness to light, from serving idols, to serve Him, who is the Sun of
   Righteousness and Fountain of Light" (Bingh. Ant. xi. vii. 7).

   [2387] Cf. Didaché, vii. 1; Justin M. Apolog. I. c. 61 A; Swainson,
   Creeds, c. iii. on the short Baptismal Professions.  "The writings of
   S. Cyprian distinctly tell us, that in his day the form of
   interrogation at Baptism was fixed and definite.  He speaks of the
   "usitata et legitima verba interrogationis,"--and we know as distinctly
   that the interrogation included the words, "Dost thou believe in God
   the Father, in His Son Christ, in the Holy Spirit?  Dost thou believe
   in remission of sins and eternal life through the Church?"

   [2388] 1 Pet. v. 9.

   [2389] Is. xxv. 8; Rev. vii. 17.

   [2390] paneguriseis

   [2391] Is. lxi. 10.

   [2392] These words seem to imply that the Lectures on the Eucharist
   were to be delivered in the Holy Sepulchre, though the Mysteries
   themselves may be called metaphorically "the Holy of Holies."

   Lecture XX.

   (On the Mysteries. II.)

   Of Baptism.

   Romans vi. 3-14

   Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ,
   were baptized into His death? &c.....for ye are not under the Law, but
   under grace.

   1.  These daily introductions into the Mysteries [2393] , and new
   instructions, which are the announcements of new truths, are profitable
   to us; and most of all to you, who have been renewed from an old state
   to a new.  Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of
   yesterday's Lecture, that ye may learn of what those things, which were
   done by you in the inner chamber [2394] , were symbolical.

   2.  As soon, then, as ye entered, ye put off your tunic; and this was
   an image of putting off the old man with his deeds [2395] .  Having
   stripped yourselves, ye were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who
   was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from
   Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them
   on the tree [2396] .  For since the adverse powers made their lair in
   your members, ye may no longer wear that old garment; I do not at all
   mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxeth corrupt in the
   lusts of deceit [2397] .  May the soul which has once put him off,
   never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song
   of Songs, I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on [2398] ?  O
   wondrous thing! ye were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed
   [2399] ; for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who
   was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.

   3.  Then, when ye were stripped, ye were anointed with exorcised oil
   [2400] , from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made
   partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ.  For ye were cut off
   from the wild olive-tree [2401] , and grafted into the good one, and
   were made to share the fatness of the true olive-tree.  The exorcised
   oil therefore was a symbol of the participation of the fatness of
   Christ, being a charm to drive away every trace of hostile influence.
   For as the breathing of the saints, and the invocation of the Name of
   God, like fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits [2402] , so
   also this exorcised oil receives such virtue by the invocation of God
   and by prayer, as not only to burn and cleanse away the traces of sins,
   but also to chase away all the invisible powers of the evil one.

   4.  After these things, ye were led to the holy pool [2403] of Divine
   Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is
   before our eyes.  And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the
   name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and ye made
   that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and
   ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial
   of Christ [2404] .  For as our Saviour passed three days and three
   nights in the heart of the earth, so you also in your first ascent out
   of the water, represented the first day of Christ in the earth, and by
   your descent, the night; for as he who is in the night, no longer sees,
   but he who is in the day, remains in the light, so in the descent, as
   in the night, ye saw nothing, but in ascending again ye were as in the
   day.  And at the self-same moment ye were both dying and being born;
   and that Water of salvation was at once your grave and your mother.
   And what Solomon spoke of others will suit you also; for he said, in
   that case, There is a time to bear and a time to die [2405] ; but to
   you, in the reverse order, there was a time to die and a time to be
   born; and one and the same time effected both of these, and your birth
   went hand in hand with your death.

   5.  O strange and inconceivable thing! we did not really die, we were
   not really buried, we were not really crucified and raised again; but
   our imitation was in a figure, and our salvation in reality.  Christ
   was actually crucified, and actually buried, and truly rose again; and
   all these things He has freely bestowed upon us, that we, sharing His
   sufferings by imitation, might gain salvation in reality.  O surpassing
   loving-kindness!  Christ received nails in His undefiled hands and
   feet, and suffered anguish; while on me without pain or toil by the
   fellowship of His suffering He freely bestows salvation.

   6.  Let no one then suppose that Baptism is merely the grace of
   remission of sins, or further, that of adoption; as John's was a
   baptism [2406] conferring only remission of sins:  whereas we know full
   well, that as it purges our sins, and ministers [2407] to us the gift
   of the Holy Ghost, so also it is the counterpart [2408] of the
   sufferings of Christ.  For this cause Paul just now cried aloud and
   said, Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ
   Jesus, were baptized into His death?  We were buried therefore with Him
   by baptism into His death [2409] .  These words he spoke to some who
   were disposed to think that Baptism ministers to us the remission of
   sins, and adoption, but has not further the fellowship also, by
   representation, of Christ's true sufferings.

   7.  In order therefore that we might learn, that whatsoever things
   Christ endured, for us and for our salvation [2410] He suffered them in
   reality and not in appearance, and that we also are made partakers of
   His sufferings, Paul cried with all exactness of truth, For if we have
   been planted together with the likeness of His death, we shall be also
   with the likeness of His resurrection.  Well has he said, planted
   together [2411] .  For since the true Vine was planted in this place,
   we also by partaking in the Baptism of death have been planted together
   with Him.  And fix thy mind with much attention on the words of the
   Apostle.  He said not, "For if we have been planted together with His
   death," but, with the likeness of His death.  For in Christ's case
   there was death in reality, for His soul was really separated from His
   body, and real burial, for His holy body was wrapt in pure linen; and
   everything happened really to Him; but in your case there was only a
   likeness of death and sufferings, whereas of salvation there was not a
   likeness but a reality.

   8.  Having been sufficiently instructed in these things, keep them, I
   beseech you, in your remembrance; that I also, unworthy though I be,
   may say of you, Now I love you [2412] , because ye always remember me,
   and hold fast the traditions, which I delivered unto you.  And God, who
   has presented you as it were alive from the dead [2413] , is able to
   grant unto you to walk in newness of life [2414] :  because His is the
   glory and the power, now and for ever.  Amen.

   [2394] The renunciation and the profession of faith were made in the
   outer chamber or vestibule of the Baptistery.

   [2395] Col. iii. 9.

   [2396] Ib. ii. 15.  Cyril's use of this passage agrees best with the
   interpretation that Christ, having been clothed with the likeness of
   sinful flesh during His life on earth, submitted therein to the
   assaults of the powers of evil, but on the Cross threw off from Himself
   both it and them.

   [2397] Eph. iv. 22.

   [2398] Cant. v. 3.

   [2399] See Dict. Christ. Antiq. "Baptism," § 48:  The Unclothing of the
   Catechumens:  Bingh. Ant. XI. xi. 1:  All "persons were baptized naked,
   either in imitation of Adam in Paradise, or our Saviour upon the Cross,
   or to signify their putting off the body of sin, and the old man with
   his deeds."

   [2400] Apost. Const. vii. 22:  "But thou shalt beforehand anoint the
   person with holy oil (elaio), and afterward baptize him with water, and
   in the conclusion shalt seal him with the ointment (muro), that the
   anointing (chrisma) may be a participation of the Holy Spirit, and the
   water a symbol of the death, and the ointment the seal of the
   Covenants.  But if there be neither oil nor ointment, water suffices
   both for anointing, and for a seal, and for a confession of Him who
   died, or indeed is dying with us."  The previous anointing "with oil
   sanctified by prayer" is mentioned in the Clementine Recognitions, III.
   c. 67, and in the Pseudo-Justin, Quæstiones ad Orthodoxos, Qu. 137.  It
   was not however universal, and seems to have been unknown in Africa,
   not being mentioned by Clement of Alexandria (Pæd. II. c. viii. On the
   use of ointments), nor Tertullian, nor Augustine.

   [2401] On the significance of the wild olive-tree, see Irenæus, V. 10.

   [2402] See Index, "Exorcism."

   [2403] kolumbethran.  The pool or piscina was deep enough for total
   immersion, and large enough for many to be baptized at once.  Cf.
   Bingh. Ant. VIII. vii. 2; XI. xi. 2, 3.  For engravings of the very
   ancient Baptisteries at Aquileia and Ravenna, shewing the form of the
   font or piscina, see Dict. Christian Ant. "Baptistery."

   [2404] The same significance is attributed to the trine immersion by
   many Fathers, but a different explanation is given by Tertullian (Adv.
   Praxean, c. xxvi.):  "Not once only, but three times, we are immersed
   into the several Persons at the mention of their several names."
   Gregory of Nyssa (On the Baptism of Christ, p. 520 in this Series)
   joins both reasons together:  "By doing this thrice we represent for
   ourselves that grace of the Resurrection which was wrought in three
   days:  and this we do, not receiving the Sacrament in silence, but
   while there are spoken over us the Names of the Three Sacred Persons on
   whom we believed, &c."  Compare p. 529.  Cf. Apost. Const VIII. § 47,
   Can. 50:  "If any Bishop or Presbyter does not perform the three
   immersions of one initiation, but one immersion made into the death of
   Christ, let him be deprived." Milles in his note on this passage
   mentions that "this form of Baptism is still used in the Greek Church.
   See Eucholog. p. 355.  Ed. Jac. Goar. and his notes p. 365."

   [2405] Eccles. iii. 2.

   [2406] Tertullian (De Baptismo, c. 10) denies that John's Baptism
   availed for the remission of sins:  "If repentance is a thing human,
   its baptism must necessarily be of the same nature:  else if it had
   been celestial, it would have given both the Holy Spirit and the
   remission of sins."  Cyril's doctrine is more in accordance with the
   language of the Fathers generally, and of St. Mark i. 4; Luke iii. 3.

   [2407] proxenon.

   [2408] antitupon.  The "Antitype" is here the sign or memorial of that
   which is past, and no longer actually present:  See note 6 on xxi. 1.
   Cf. Heb. ix. 24.

   [2409] Rom. vi. 3.  In the following sentence several mss. have a
   different reading:  "These things perhaps he said to some who were
   disposed to think that Baptism ministers remission of sins only, and
   not adoption, and that further it has not the fellowship, &c."  Against
   this reading, approve by Milles, the Benedictine Editor argues that in
   Rom. vi. 3, 4, there is no reference to adoption, but only to the
   fellowship of Christ's Passion, and that Cyril quotes the passage only
   to prove the latter, the gift of adoption being generally admitted, and
   therefore not in question.

   [2410] This clause is contained in the Nicene Creed, and in that which
   was offered to the Council by Eusebius as the ancient Creed of
   Cæsarea.  It probably formed part of the Creed of Jerusalem, though it
   is not found in the titles of the Lectures, nor specially explained.

   [2411] Ib. vi. 5.  Cyril gives the phrase "planted together" a special
   application to those who had been baptized in the same place where
   Christ had been buried.

   Lecture XXI.

   (On the Mysteries. III.)

   On Chrism.

   1 John ii. 20-28

   But ye have an unction from the Holy One, &c.....that, when He shall
   appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before Him at His
   coming.

   1.  Having been baptized into Christ, and put on Christ [2415] , ye
   have been made conformable to the Son of God; for God having
   foreordained us unto adoption as sons [2416] , made us to be conformed
   to the body of Christ's glory [2417] .  Having therefore become
   partakers of Christ [2418] , ye are properly called Christs, and of you
   God said, Touch not My Christs [2419] , or anointed.  Now ye have been
   made Christs, by receiving the antitype [2420] of the Holy Ghost; and
   all things have been wrought in you by imitation [2421] , because ye
   are images of Christ.  He washed in the river Jordan, and having
   imparted of the fragrance [2422] of His Godhead to the waters, He came
   up from them; and the Holy Ghost in the fulness of His being [2423]
   lighted on Him, like resting upon like [2424] .  And to you in like
   manner, after you had come up from the pool of the sacred streams,
   there was given an Unction [2425] , the anti-type of that wherewith
   Christ was anointed; and this is the Holy Ghost; of whom also the
   blessed Esaias, in his prophecy respecting Him, said in the person of
   the Lord, The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed
   Me:  He hath sent Me to preach glad tidings to the poor [2426] .

   2.  For Christ was not anointed by men with oil or material ointment,
   but the Father having before appointed Him to be the Saviour of the
   whole world, anointed Him with the Holy Ghost, as Peter says, Jesus of
   Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Ghost [2427] .  David also
   the Prophet cried, saying, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a
   sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom; Thou hast loved
   righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God even Thy God hath
   anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows [2428] .  And
   as Christ was in reality crucified, and buried, and raised, and you are
   in Baptism accounted worthy of being crucified, buried, and raised
   together with Him in a likeness, so is it with the unction also.  As He
   was anointed with an ideal [2429] oil of gladness, that is, with the
   Holy Ghost, called oil of gladness, because He is the author of
   spiritual gladness, so ye were anointed with ointment, having been made
   partakers and fellows of Christ.

   3.  But beware of supposing this to be plain ointment.  For as the
   Bread of the Eucharist, after the invocation of the Holy Ghost, is mere
   bread no longer [2430] , but the Body of Christ, so also this holy
   ointment is no more simple ointment, nor (so to say) common, after
   invocation, but it is Christ's gift of grace, and, by the advent of the
   Holy Ghost, is made fit to impart His Divine Nature [2431] .  Which
   ointment is symbolically applied to thy forehead and thy other senses
   [2432] ; and while thy body is anointed with the visible ointment, thy
   soul is sanctified by the Holy and life-giving Spirit.

   4.  And ye were first anointed on the forehead, that ye might be
   delivered from the shame, which the first man who transgressed bore
   about with him everywhere; and that with unveiled face ye might reflect
   as a mirror the glory of the Lord [2433] .  Then on your ears; that ye
   might receive the ears which are quick to hear the Divine Mysteries, of
   which Esaias said, The Lord gave me also an ear to hear [2434] ; and
   the Lord Jesus in the Gospel, He that hath ears to hear let him hear
   [2435] .  Then on the nostrils; that receiving the sacred ointment ye
   may say, We are to God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved
   [2436] .  Afterwards on your breast; that having put on the
   breast-plate of righteousness, ye may stand against the wiles of the
   devil [2437] .  For as Christ after His Baptism, and the visitation of
   the Holy Ghost, went forth and vanquished the adversary, so likewise
   ye, after Holy Baptism and the Mystical Chrism, having put on the whole
   armour of the Holy Ghost, are to stand against the power of the
   adversary, and vanquish it, saying, I can do all things through Christ
   which strengtheneth me [2438] .

   5.  Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, ye are called
   Christians, verifying the name also by your new birth.  For before you
   were deemed worthy of this grace, ye had properly no right to this
   title, but were advancing on your way towards being Christians.

   6.  Moreover, you should know that in the old Scripture there lies the
   symbol of this Chrism.  For what time Moses imparted to his brother the
   command of God, and made him High-priest, after bathing in water, he
   anointed him; and Aaron was called Christ or Anointed, evidently from
   the typical Chrism.  So also the High-priest, in advancing Solomon to
   the kingdom, anointed him after he had bathed in Gihon [2439] .  To
   them however these things happened in a figure, but to you not in a
   figure, but in truth; because ye were truly anointed by the Holy
   Ghost.  Christ is the beginning of your salvation; for He is truly the
   First-fruit, and ye the mass [2440] ; but if the First-fruit be holy,
   it is manifest that Its holiness will pass to the mass also.

   7.  Keep This unspotted:  for it shall teach you all things, if it
   abide in you, as you have just heard declared by the blessed John,
   discoursing much concerning this Unction [2441] .  For this holy thing
   is a spiritual safeguard of the body, and salvation of the soul.  Of
   this the blessed Esaias prophesying of old time said, And on this
   mountain,--(now he calls the Church a mountain elsewhere also, as when
   he says, In the last days the mountain of the Lord's house shall be
   manifest [2442] ;)--on this mountain shall the Lord make unto all
   nations a feast; they shall drink wine, they shall drink gladness, they
   shall anoint themselves with ointment [2443] .  And that he may make
   thee sure, hear what he says of this ointment as being mystical;
   Deliver all these things to the nations, for the counsel of the Lord is
   unto all nations [2444] .  Having been anointed, therefore, with this
   holy ointment, keep it unspotted and unblemished in you, pressing
   forward by good works, and being made well-pleasing to the Captain of
   your salvation, Christ Jesus, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
   Amen.

   [2422] chroton, literally "tinctures."  The Ben. Ed. writes:  "For
   photon we have written chroton with Codd. Coisl. Ottob. Roe, Casaub.,
   &c...But we must write chroton from chrota, not chroton from chrotes.
   Authors use the word chrota to signify the effluence of an odour.  So
   Gregory of Nyssa takes it in his 3rd Homily on the Song of Songs, p.
   512; and S. Maximus in Question 37 on Scripture:  chrota we say is the
   godliness (eusebeian) whereby S. Paul was to the one a savour of life
   unto life.'...In the Procatechesis, § 15, Cyril calls the waters of
   Baptism hudaton christophoron echonton euodian.  If however any one
   prefers the reading photon, he may defend himself by the authority of
   Epiphanius, who in the Exposition of the Faith, c. 15, says that Christ
   descending into the water gave rather than received,....illuminating
   them, and empowering them for a type of what was to be accomplished in
   Him."  According to the Ebionite Gospel of St. Matthew in Epiphanius
   (Hær. xxx. Ebionitæ. c. 13), when Jesus came up out of the water a
   great light shone around the place:  a tradition to which the
   Benedictine Editor thinks the reading photon may refer.  Justin M.
   (Dialog. c. lxxxviii.):  "When Jesus had stepped into the water, a fire
   was kindled in the Jordan."  Otto quotes the legend, as found in Orac.
   Sibyll. vii. 81-83:-- Os se Logon gennese Pater Pneum' ornin apheken,
   'Oxun apangeltera logon, Logon hudasin hagnois Rainon, son Baptisma di'
   hou puros exephaanthes .

   [2423] ousiodes epiphoiesis egeneto.  The Benedictine Editor
   understands this phrase as an allusion to the descent of the Holy Ghost
   on Jesus in a substantial bodily form.  So Gregory Nazianzen (Orat
   xliv. 17), says that the Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles ousiodos
   kai somatikos.  But Anastasius Sinaita interprets ousiodos in this
   latter passage as meaning "in the essence and reality of His (Divine )
   Person:"  and this latter sense agreeing with the frequent use of
   ousiodes by Athanasius is well rendered by Canon Mason (The Relation of
   Confirmation to Baptism, p. 343, "in the fulness of His being."

   [2424] Cf. Greg. Naz. Orat. xxxix:  "The Sprit also bears witness to
   His Godhead, for he comes to that which is like Himself."

   [2425] Cf. Tertullian, De Baptismo, c. 7:  "Exinde egressi de lavacro
   perungimur benedictâ unctione."  It is clear that the Unction mentioned
   in these passages was conferred at the same time and place as Baptism.
   Whether it formed part of that Sacrament, or was regarded by Cyril as a
   separate and independent rite, has been made a matter of controversy.

   the Introduction.

   [2431] Christou charisma kai Pneumatos hagiou parousia tes autou
   Theotetos energetikon ginomenon.  The meaning of this passage seems to
   have been obscured by divergent views of the order and construction of
   the words.  In the Oxford translation, followed by Dr. Pusey (Real
   Presence, p. 357), the Chrism is "the gift of Christ, and by the
   presence of His godhead it causes in us the Holy Ghost."  The order of
   the operations proper to the two Divine Persons seems thus to be
   inverted. According to the Benedictine Editor, and Canon Mason
   (Relation of Confirmation to Baptism, p. 344), it is "Christ's gracious
   gift, and is made effectual to convey the Holy Ghost by the presence of
   His own Godhead,"--i.e. apparently, the Godhead of the Holy Ghost
   conveys the Holy Ghost. But according to the context "the presence"
   must be that of the Divine Person who has been invoked, namely the Holy
   Ghost:  and this is clearly expressed in the order of the words
   Pneumatos hagiou parousia tes autou theotetos energetikon.  The
   connexion of the words Pn. hag. parousia is put beyond doubt by the
   Invocation in the Liturgy of S. James quoted in Myst. V. 7, note 8.
   The true meaning thus seems to be that the Chrism is Christ's gift of
   grace, and imparts His Divine nature by the presence of the Holy Ghost
   after the Invocation.  This meaning is confirmed by the formula given
   in Apost. Const. vii. 44, for the consecration of the Chrism:  "Grant
   also now that this ointment may be made effectual in the baptized, that
   the sweet savour of Thy Christ may remain firm and stable in him, and
   that, having died with Him, he may rise again and live with Him."  The
   Chrism is thus regarded as "the Seal" which confirms the proper
   benefits of Baptism.

   Lecture XXII.

   (On the Mysteries. IV.)

   On the Body and Blood of Christ.

   1 Cor. xi. 23

   I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, how that
   the Lord Jesus, in the night in which He was betrayed, took bread, &c.

   1.  Even of itself [2445] the teaching of the Blessed Paul is
   sufficient to give you a full assurance concerning those Divine
   Mysteries, of which having been deemed worthy, ye are become of the
   same body [2446] and blood with Christ.  For you have just heard him
   say distinctly, That our Lord Jesus Christ in the night in which He was
   betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks He brake it, and
   gave to His disciples, saying, Take, eat, this is My Body:  and having
   taken the cup and given thanks, He said, Take, drink, this is My Blood
   [2447] .  Since then He Himself declared and said of the Bread, This is
   My Body, who shall dare to doubt any longer?  And since He has Himself
   affirmed and said, This is My Blood, who shall ever hesitate, saying,
   that it is not His blood?

   2.  He once in Cana of Galilee, turned the water into wine, akin to
   blood [2448] , and is it incredible that He should have turned wine
   into blood?  When called to a bodily marriage, He miraculously wrought
   [2449] that wonderful work; and on the children of the bride-chamber
   [2450] , shall He not much rather be acknowledged to have bestowed the
   fruition of His Body and Blood [2451] ?

   3.  Wherefore with full assurance let us partake as of the Body and
   Blood of Christ:  for in the figure [2452] of Bread is given to thee
   His Body, and in the figure of Wine His Blood; that thou by partaking
   of the Body and Blood of Christ, mayest be made of the same body and
   the same blood with Him.  For thus we come to bear Christ [2453] in us,
   because His Body and Blood are distributed [2454] through our members;
   thus it is that, according to the blessed Peter, we become partakers of
   the divine nature [2455] .

   4.  Christ on a certain occasion discoursing with the Jews said, Except
   ye eat My flesh and drink My blood, ye have no life in you [2456] .
   They not having heard His saying in a spiritual sense were offended,
   and went back, supposing that He was inviting them to eat flesh.

   5.  In the Old Testament also there was shew-bread; but this, as it
   belonged to the Old Testament, has come to an end; but in the New
   Testament there is Bread of heaven, and a Cup of salvation, sanctifying
   soul and body; for as the Bread corresponds to our body, so is the Word
   [2457] appropriate to our soul.

   6.  Consider therefore the Bread and the Wine not as bare elements, for
   they are, according to the Lord's declaration, the Body and Blood of
   Christ; for even though sense suggests this to thee, yet let faith
   establish thee.  Judge not the matter from the taste, but from faith be
   fully assured without misgiving, that the Body and Blood of Christ have
   been vouchsafed to thee.

   7.  Also the blessed David shall advise thee the meaning of this,
   saying, Thou hast prepared a table before me in the presence of them
   that afflict me [2458] .  What he says, is to this effect:  Before Thy
   coming, the evil spirits prepared a table for men [2459] , polluted and
   defiled and full of devilish influence [2460] ; but since Thy coming. O
   Lord, Thou hast prepared a table before me.  When the man says to God,
   Thou hast prepared before me a table, what other does he indicate but
   that mystical and spiritual Table, which God hath prepared for us over
   against, that is, contrary and in opposition to the evil spirits?  And
   very truly; for that had communion with devils, but this, with God.
   Thou hast anointed my head with oil [2461] .  With oil He anointed
   thine head upon thy forehead, for the seal which thou hast of God; that
   thou mayest be made the engraving of the signet, Holiness unto God
   [2462] .  And thy cup intoxicateth me, as very strong [2463] .  Thou
   seest that cup here spoken of, which Jesus took in His hands, and gave
   thanks, and said, This is My blood, which is shed for many for the
   remission of sins [2464] .

   8.  Therefore Solomon also, hinting at this grace, says in
   Ecclesiastes, Come hither, eat thy bread with joy (that is, the
   spiritual bread; Come hither, he calls with the call to salvation and
   blessing), and drink thy wine with a merry heart (that is, the
   spiritual wine); and let oil be poured out upon thy head (thou seest he
   alludes even to the mystic Chrism); and let thy garments be always
   white, for the Lord is well pleased with thy works [2465] ; for before
   thou camest to Baptism, thy works were vanity of vanities [2466] .  But
   now, having put off thy old garments, and put on those which are
   spiritually white, thou must be continually robed in white:  of course
   we mean not this, that thou art always to wear white raiment; but thou
   must be clad in the garments that are truly white and shining and
   spiritual, that thou mayest say with the blessed Esaias, My soul shall
   be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with a garment of
   salvation, and put a robe of gladness around me [2467] .

   9.  Having learnt these things, and been fully assured that the seeming
   bread is not bread, though sensible to taste, but the Body of Christ;
   and that the seeming wine is not wine, though the taste will have it
   so, but the Blood of Christ [2468] ; and that of this David sung of
   old, saying, And bread strengtheneth man's heart, to make his face to
   shine with oil [2469] , "strengthen thou thine heart," by partaking
   thereof as spiritual, and "make the face of thy soul to shine."  And so
   having it unveiled with a pure conscience, mayest thou reflect as a
   mirror the glory of the Lord [2470] , and proceed from glory to glory,
   in Christ Jesus our Lord:--To whom be honour, and might, and glory, for
   ever and ever.  Amen.

   [2446] Introduction, "Eucharist."  The word sussomoi has a different
   sense in Eph. iii. 6, where it is applied to the Gentiles as having
   been made members of Christ's body the Church.

   [2447] 1 Cor. xi. 23.  The clause "and gave to His disciples" is an
   addition taken from Matt. xxvi. 26.  The part relating to the cup does
   not correspond exactly either with St. Paul's language or with the
   Evangelists'.

   (Prevot.). Rupp.  The whole passage is omitted in Codd. Coisl. R.
   Casaub. owing to the repetition of haima The reading oikeio neumati,
   "by His own will," introduces a superfluous thought, and destroys the
   very point of Cyril's argument, in which the previous change of water
   into an element so different as wine is regarded as giving an a
   fortiori probability to the change of that which is already "akin to
   blood" into blood itself. If Cyril thus seems to teach a physical
   change of the wine, it must be remembered that we are not bound to
   accept his view, but only to state it accurately.  See however the
   section of the Introduction on his Eucharistic doctrine.

   Olympiad. de Deo, § 1, c.:  tote thaumatourgei kai paradoxopoiei.

   [2450] Matt. ix. 15.

   [2451] Ben. Ed.:  "That the force of Cyril's argument may be the better
   understood, we must observe that in Baptism is celebrated the marriage
   of Christ with the Christian soul; and that the consummation of this
   marriage is perfected through the union of bodies in the mystery of the
   Eucharist.  Read Chrysostom's Hom. xx. in Ephes."  Chrysostom's words
   are:  "In like manner therefore we become one flesh with Christ by
   participation (metousias)."  But the participation expressed by
   metousia does not necessarily refer to the Eucharist.  From the use of
   the word in Cat. xxiii. 11, and in Athanasius (Contra Arianos, Or. i.;
   de Synodis. 19, 22, 25) the meaning rather seems to be that we are one
   flesh with Christ not by nature but by His gift.

   well with the Genitives tou somatos and tou haimatos.  It is evident
   that it was an ill-contrived emendation of anadidomenou, the
   transcribers being offended at the distribution of Christ's Body among
   our members.  But Cyril uses even the same word in Cat. xxiii. 9:
   Houtos ho artos....eis pasan sou ten sustasin anadidotai, eis opheleian
   somatos kai psuches, This Bread is distributed into thy whole system,
   to the benefit of body and soul.'"  'Anadidomenou is the reading of
   Milles and Rupp.  For similar language see Justin M. Apol. i. 66; Iren.
   V. ii. 2.

   [2455] 2 Pet. i. 4.

   [2456] John vi. 53.

   [2457] Ben. Ed.:  "Here we are to understand (by ho Logos) the Divine
   Word, not the bare discourse of God, but the second Person of the Holy
   Trinity, Christ Himself, the Bread of Heaven, as He testifies of
   Himself, John vi. 51:  Him Cyril contrasts with the earthly shew-bread
   in the O.T.; otherwise he could not rightly from this sentence infer,
   by the particle oun, "therefore," that the Eucharist is truly the Body
   and Blood of Christ.  And since he says, in Cat. xxiii. 15, that the
   Eucharistic food is "appointed for the substance of the soul," for its
   benefit, that cannot be said of Christ's body or of His soul, but only
   of the Word which is conjoined with both.  Moreover that the Divine
   Word is the food of Angels and of the soul, is a common mode of
   speaking with all the Fathers.  They often play on the ambiguity of
   this word (logos), saying sometimes that the Divine Word, sometimes the
   word and oracles of God, are the food of our souls:  both statements
   are true.  For the whole life-giving power of the Eucharist is derived
   from the Word of God united to the flesh which He assumed:  and the
   whole benefit of Eucharistic eating consists in the union of our soul
   with the Word, in meditation on His mysteries and sayings, and
   conformity thereto."

   which the forehead is signed with ointment, and the soul with the seal
   of God.

   [2463] Ps. xxiii. 5:  My cup runneth over.  Eusebius (Dem. Evang. I. c.

   Lecture XXIII.

   (On the Mysteries. V.)

   On the Sacred Liturgy and Communion [2471] .

   1 Pet. ii. 1

   Wherefore putting away all filthiness, and all guile, and evil speaking
   [2472] , &c.

   1.  By the loving-kindness of God ye have heard sufficiently at our
   former meetings concerning Baptism, and Chrism, and partaking of the
   Body and Blood of Christ; and now it is necessary to pass on to what is
   next in order, meaning to-day to set the crown on the spiritual
   building of your edification.

   2.  Ye have seen then the Deacon who gives to the Priest water to wash
   [2473] , and to the Presbyters who stand round God's altar.  He gave it
   not at all because of bodily defilement; it is not that; for we did not
   enter the Church at first [2474] with defiled bodies.  But the washing
   of hands is a symbol that ye ought to be pure from all sinful and
   unlawful deeds; for since the hands are a symbol of action, by washing
   [2475] them, it is evident, we represent the purity and blamelessness
   of our conduct.  Didst thou not hear the blessed David opening this
   very mystery, and saying, I will wash my hands in innocency, and so
   will compass Thine Altar, O Lord [2476] ?  The washing therefore of
   hands is a symbol of immunity [2477] from sin.

   3.  Then the Deacon cries aloud, "Receive ye one another; and let us
   kiss one another [2478] ."  Think not that this kiss is of the same
   character with those given in public by common friends.  It is not
   such:  but this kiss blends souls one with another, and courts entire
   forgiveness for them.  The kiss therefore is the sign that our souls
   are mingled together, and banish all remembrance of wrongs.  For this
   cause Christ said, If thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and
   there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against time, leave there
   thy gift upon the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
   brother, and then come and offer thy gift [2479] .  The kiss therefore
   is reconciliation, and for this reason holy:  as the blessed Paul
   somewhere cried, saying, Greet ye one another with a holy kiss [2480] ;
   and Peter, with a kiss of charity [2481] .

   4.  After this the Priest cries aloud, "Lift up your hearts [2482] ."
   For truly ought we in that most awful hour to have our heart on high
   with God, and not below, thinking of earth and earthly things.  In
   effect therefore the Priest bids all in that hour to dismiss all cares
   of this life, or household anxieties, and to have their heart in heaven
   with the merciful God.  Then ye answer, "We lift them up unto the
   Lord:"  assenting to it, by your avowal.  But let no one come here, who
   could say with his mouth, "We lift up our hearts unto the Lord," but in
   his thoughts have his mind concerned with the cares of this life.  At
   all times, rather, God should be in our memory but if this is
   impossible by reason of human infirmity, in that hour above all this
   should be our earnest endeavour.

   5.  Then the Priest says, "Let us give thanks unto the Lord."  For
   verily we are bound to give thanks, that He called us, unworthy as we
   were, to so great grace; that He reconciled us when we were His foes;
   that He vouchsafed to us the Spirit of adoption.  Then ye say, "It is
   meet and right:"  for in giving thanks we do a meet thing and a right;
   but He did not right, but more than right, in doing us good, and
   counting us meet for such great benefits.

   6.  After this, we make mention of heaven, and earth, and sea [2483] ;
   of sun and moon; of stars and all the creation, rational and
   irrational, visible and invisible; of Angels, Archangels, Virtues,
   Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Thrones; of the Cherubim with many
   faces:  in effect repeating that call of David's Magnify the Lord with
   me [2484] .  We make mention also of the Seraphim, whom Esaias in the
   Holy Spirit saw standing around the throne of God, and with two of
   their wings veiling their face, and with twain their feet, while with
   twain they did fly, crying Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Sabaoth
   [2485] .  For the reason of our reciting this confession of God [2486]
   , delivered down to us from the Seraphim, is this, that so we may be
   partakers with the hosts of the world above in their Hymn of praise.

   7.  Then having sanctified ourselves by these spiritual Hymns, we
   beseech the merciful God to send forth His Holy Spirit upon the gifts
   lying before Him; that He may make the Bread the Body of Christ, and
   the Wine the Blood of Christ [2487] ; for whatsoever the Holy Ghost has
   touched, is surely sanctified and changed.

   8.  Then, after the spiritual sacrifice, the bloodless service, is
   completed, over that sacrifice of propitiation [2488] we entreat God
   for the common peace of the Churches, for the welfare of the world
   [2489] ; for kings; for soldiers and allies; for the sick; for the
   afflicted; and, in a word, for all who stand in need of succour we all
   pray and offer this sacrifice.

   9.  Then we commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before us,
   first Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, that at their prayers
   and intercessions God would receive our petition [2490] .  Then on
   behalf also of the Holy Fathers and Bishops who have fallen asleep
   before us, and in a word of all who in past years have fallen asleep
   among us, believing that it will be a very great benefit to the souls
   [2491] , for whom the supplication is put up, while that holy and most
   awful sacrifice is set forth.

   10.  And I wish to persuade you by an illustration.  For I know that
   many say, what is a soul profited, which departs from this world either
   with sins, or without sins, if it be commemorated in the prayer?  For
   if a king were to banish certain who had given him offence, and then
   those who belong to them [2492] should weave a crown and offer it to
   him on behalf of those under punishment, would he not grant a remission
   of their penalties?  In the same way we, when we offer to Him our
   supplications for those who have fallen asleep, though they be sinners,
   weave no crown, but offer up Christ sacrificed for our sins [2493] ,
   propitiating our merciful God for them as well as for ourselves.

   11.  Then, after these things, we say that Prayer which the Saviour
   delivered to His own disciples, with a pure conscience entitling God
   our Father, and saying, Our Father, which art in heaven.  O most
   surpassing loving-kindness of God!  On them who revolted from Him and
   were in the very extreme of misery has He bestowed such a complete
   forgiveness of evil deeds, and so great participation of grace, as that
   they should even call Him Father.  Our Father, which art in heaven; and
   they also are a heaven who bear the image of the heavenly [2494] , in
   whom is God, dwelling and walking in them [2495] .

   12.  Hallowed be Thy Name.  The Name of God is in its nature holy,
   whether we say so or not; but since it is sometimes profaned among
   sinners, according to the words, Through you My Name is continually
   blasphemed among the Gentiles [2496] , we pray that in us God's Name
   may be hallowed; not that it comes to be holy from not being holy, but
   because it becomes holy in us, when we are made holy, and do things
   worthy of holiness.

   13.  Thy kingdom come.  A pure soul can say with boldness, Thy kingdom
   come; for he who has heard Paul saying, Let not therefore sin reign in
   your mortal body [2497] , and has cleansed himself in deed, and
   thought, and word, will say to God, Thy kingdom come.

   14.  Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth.  God's divine and
   blessed Angels do the will of God, as David said in the Psalm, Bless
   the Lord, all ye Angels of His, mighty in strength, that do His
   pleasure [2498] .  So then in effect thou meanest this by thy prayer,
   "as in the Angels Thy will is done, so likewise be it done on earth in
   me, O Lord."

   15.  Give us this day our substantial bread.  This common bread is not
   substantial bread, but this Holy Bread is substantial, that is,
   appointed for the substance of the soul [2499] .  For this Bread goeth
   not into the belly and is cast out into the draught [2500] , but is
   distributed into thy whole system for the benefit of body and soul
   [2501] .  But by this day, he means, "each day," as also Paul said,
   While it is called to-day [2502] .

   16.  And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.  For we
   have many sins.  For we offend both in word and in thought, and very
   many things we do worthy of condemnation; and if we say that we have no
   sin, we lie, as John says [2503] .  And we make a covenant with God,
   entreating Him to forgive us our sins, as we also forgive our
   neighbours their debts.  Considering then what we receive and in return
   for what, let us not put off nor delay to forgive one another.  The
   offences committed against us are slight and trivial, and easily
   settled; but those which we have committed against God are great, and
   need such mercy as His only is.  Take heed therefore, lest for the
   slight and trivial sins against thee thou shut out for thyself
   forgiveness from God for thy very grievous sins.

   17.  And lead us not into temptation, O Lord.  Is this then what the
   Lord teaches us to pray, that we may not be tempted at all?  How then
   is it said elsewhere, "a man untempted, is a man unproved [2504] ;" and
   again, My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
   temptations [2505] ?  But does perchance the entering into temptation
   mean the being overwhelmed by the temptation?  For temptation is, as it
   were, like a winter torrent difficult to cross.  Those therefore who
   are not overwhelmed in temptations, pass through, shewing themselves
   excellent swimmers, and not being swept away by them at all; while
   those who are not such, enter into them and are overwhelmed.  As for
   example, Judas having entered into the temptation of the love of money,
   swam not through it, but was overwhelmed and was strangled [2506] both
   in body and spirit.  Peter entered into the temptation of the denial;
   but having entered, he was not overwhelmed by it, but manfully swam
   through it, and was delivered from the temptation [2507] .  Listen
   again, in another place, to a company of unscathed saints, giving
   thanks for deliverance from temptation, Thou, O God hast proved us;
   Thou hast tried us by fire like as silver is tried.  Thou broughtest us
   into the net; Thou layedst afflictions upon our loins.  Thou hast
   caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water; and
   thou broughtest us out into a place of rest [2508] .  Thou seest them
   speaking boldly in regard to their having passed through and not been
   pierced [2509] .  But Thou broughtest us out into a place of rest; now
   their coming into a place of rest is their being delivered from
   temptation.

   18.  But deliver us from the evil.  If Lead us not into temptation
   implied the not being tempted at all, He would not have said, But
   deliver us from the evil.  Now evil is our adversary the devil, from
   whom we pray to be delivered [2510] .  Then after completing the prayer
   thou sayest, Amen [2511] ; by this Amen, which means "So be it,"
   setting thy seal to the petitions of the divinely-taught prayer.

   19.  After this the Priest says, "Holy things to holy men."  Holy are
   the gifts presented, having received the visitation of the Holy Ghost;
   holy are ye also, having been deemed worthy of the Holy Ghost; the holy
   things therefore correspond to the holy persons [2512] .  Then ye say,
   "One is Holy, One is the Lord, Jesus Christ [2513] ."  For One is truly
   holy, by nature holy; we too are holy, but not by nature, only by
   participation, and discipline, and prayer.

   20.  After this ye hear the chanter inviting you with a sacred melody
   to the communion of the Holy Mysteries, and saying, O taste and see
   that the Lord is good [2514] .  Trust not the judgment to thy bodily
   palate [2515] no, but to faith unfaltering; for they who taste are
   bidden to taste, not bread and wine, but the anti-typical [2516] Body
   and Blood of Christ.

   21.  In approaching [2517] therefore, come not with thy wrists
   extended, or thy fingers spread; but make thy left hand a throne for
   the right, as for that which is to receive a King [2518] .  And having
   hollowed thy palm, receive the Body of Christ, saying over it, Amen.
   So then after having carefully hallowed thine eyes by the touch of the
   Holy Body, partake of it; giving heed lest thou lose any portion
   thereof [2519] ; for whatever thou losest, is evidently a loss to thee
   as it were from one of thine own members.  For tell me, if any one gave
   thee grains of gold, wouldest thou not hold them with all carefulness,
   being on thy guard against losing any of them, and suffering loss?
   Wilt thou not then much more carefully keep watch, that not a crumb
   fall from thee of what is more precious than gold and precious stones?

   22.  Then after thou hast partaken of the Body of Christ, draw near
   also to the Cup of His Blood; not stretching forth thine hands, but
   bending [2520] , and saying with an air of worship and reverence, Amen
   [2521] , hallow thyself by partaking also of the Blood of Christ.  And
   while the moisture is still upon thy lips, touch it with thine hands,
   and hallow thine eyes and brow and the other organs of sense [2522] .
   Then wait for the prayer, and give thanks unto God, who hath accounted
   thee worthy of so great mysteries [2523] .

   23.  Hold fast these traditions undefiled and, keep yourselves free
   from offence.  Sever not yourselves from the Communion; deprive not
   yourselves, through the pollution of sins, of these Holy and Spiritual
   Mysteries.  And the God of peace sanctify you wholly; and may your
   spirit, and soul, and body be preserved entire without blame at the
   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ [2524] :--To whom be glory and honour
   and might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and world
   without end.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2471] This title is added by the Benedictine Editor.  There is nothing
   corresponding to it in the Greek.

   [2472] The text is made up from memory of James i. 21:  dio apothemenoi
   pasan rhuparian, and 1 Pet. ii. 1:  apothemenoi oun pasan kakian kai
   panta dolon kai hupokriseis kai pasas katalalias.

   [2473] In the Apostolic Constitutions, VIII. xi, this duty is assigned
   to a sub-deacon:  "Let one of the sub-deacons bring water to wash the
   hands of the priests, which is a symbol of the purity of those souls
   that are devoted to God."  See Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,
   "Lavabo."  The Priest who celebrates the Eucharist is here
   distinguished by the title hiereus from the other Presbyters who stood
   round the altar.

   [2474] Cyril evidently refers to the custom of placing vessels of water
   outside the entrance of the Church.  Bingham, Antiquities, VIII. iii.
   6.  Chrysost. In Johannem Hom. lxxiii. 3:  "Do we then wash our hands
   when going into Church, and shall we not wash our hearts also?"  That
   the same custom was observed in heathen Temples appears from Herod. I.
   51:  perirrhanteria duo anetheke (See Bähr's note).  Compare also
   Joseph. Ant. Jud. III. vi. 2.

   [2475] [to] nipsasthai.  Rupp:  "To ex conjectura addidi."  Possibly
   the original reading was nipsamenoi, which would easily become altered
   through the presence of nipsasthai in the preceding line.  This washing
   is not mentioned in the Liturgy of St. James.

   [2476] Ps. xxvi. 6.  In the Liturgy of Constantinople this Psalm was
   chanted by the Priest and Deacon while washing their hands at the
   Prothesis or Credence.

   [2477] anupeuthunos.

   [2478] These two directions by the Deacon are separated in the Liturgy
   of St. James:  after the dismissal of the Catechumens, the Deacon says,
   "Take note one of another;" and after the Incense, Cherubic hymn,
   Oblation, Creed, and a short prayer "that we may be united one to
   another in the bond of peace and charity," the Deacon says, "Let us
   salute (agapomen) one another with a holy kiss."  In the Apostolic
   Constitutions, VIII. 11, there is but one such direction, and this
   comes before the washing of hands and the dismissal of the Catechumens,
   "Salute (aspasasthe) ye one another with a holy kiss."

   [2479] Matt. v. 23.  From Cyril's reference to this passage "it may be
   inferred that the kiss of peace had been given before the gifts were
   brought to the altar, according to ancient custom attested by Justin M.
   Apolog. i. c. 65:  Having ended the prayers' (for the newly baptized)
   we salute one another with a kiss.  Then there is brought to the
   President of the brethren bread, and a cup of wine mixed with water'"
   (Ben. Ed.).  There is the same order in the Apost. Const. VIII. 12, and
   in the 19th Canon of the Synod of Laodicea; but in the Liturgy of S.
   James the gifts are offered before the kiss of peace.

   [2480] 1 Cor. xvi. 20.

   [2481] 1 Pet. iii. 15.

   [2482] The words are slightly varied in the Liturgies:  thus in the
   Liturgy of St. James, "Let us lift up our mind and hearts;" in the
   Apost. Const. viii. 12, "Lift up your mind."

   [2483] Compare the noble Eucharistic Preface in the Liturgy of St.
   James:  "It is verily meet, right, becoming, and our bounden duty to
   praise Thee, to sing of Thee, to bless Thee, to worship Thee, to
   glorify Thee, to give thanks to Thee the Maker of every creature,
   visible and invisible, the Treasure of eternal blessings; the Fount of
   life and immortality, the God and Lord of all, whom the heavens of
   heavens do praise, and all the powers thereof, sun and moon and all the
   choir of the stars, earth, sea, and all that in them is, Jerusalem the
   heavenly assembly, Church of the firstborn that are written in the
   heavens, spirits of righteous men and prophets, souls of martyrs and
   Apostles.  Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities,
   Authorities, and Powers dread, also the many-eyed Cherubim, and the
   six-winged Seraphim, which with twain of their wings cover their faces,
   and with twain their feet, and with twain do fly, crying one to another
   with unresting lips, in unceasing praises, singing with loud voice the
   triumphant hymn of Thy majestic glory, shouting, and glorifying, and
   crying aloud, and saying,--Holy, Holy, Holy, O Lord of Hosts, heaven
   and earth are full of Thy glory.  Hosanna in the highest; blessed is He
   that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest."

   [2484] Ps. xxxiv. 3.

   [2485] Is. vi. 2, 3.

   [2486] theologian, "the doctrine of the Godhead," either of the Son in
   particular, or, as here, of the whole Trinity:  cf. Athanas. Contra
   Arianos, Or. i. § 18:  nun en triadi he theologia teleia estin.

   [2487] In the Liturgy of St. James the Triumphal Hymn is followed by
   the Recital of the work of Redemption,' and of the Institution,' by the
   Great Olbation,' and then by the Invocation,' as follows:  "Have mercy
   upon us, O God, after Thy great mercy, and send forth on us, and on
   these gifts here set before Thee, Thine all-holy Spirit,....that He may
   come, and by His holy, good, and glorious advent (parousia) may
   sanctify this Bread and make it the holy Body of Thy Christ (Amen), and
   this Cup the precious Blood of Thy Christ" (Amen).  In Cat. xix. 7,
   Cyril calls this prayer "the holy Invocation of the Adorable Trinity,"
   and in xxi. 3, "the Invocation of the Holy Ghost."

   [2488] See Index, "Sacrifice," and the reference there to the
   Introduction.  Compare Athenagoras (Apol. c. xiii.):  "What have I to
   do with burnt-offerings, of which God has no need?  Though indeed it
   behoves us to bring a bloodless sacrifice, and the reasonable service."

   [2489] Cyril here gives a brief summary of the "Great Intercession," in
   which, according to the common text of the Liturgy of St. James, there
   is a suffrage "for the peace and welfare (eustatheia) of the whole
   world, and of the holy Churches of God."  Mr. Hammond thinks that it
   has been taken from the Deacon's Litany, and repeated by mistake in the
   Great Intercession.  But from Chrysostom's language (In Ep. ad Phil.
   Hom. iii. p. 218; Guame, T. xi. p. 251), we must infer that the prayer
   huper eirenes kai eustatheias tou kosmou formed part of the Great
   Intercession' in his Liturgy, as it does in the Clementine (Apost.
   Constit. VIII. § 10).

   [2490] In the Liturgies of St. James and St. Mark, and in the
   Clementine, there are similar commemorations of departed saints,
   especially "patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs," but nothing
   corresponding to the words, "that at their prayers and intercessions
   God would receive our petition."  See Index, Prayer and Intercession.

   [2491] So Chrysostom (In 1 Cor. Hom. 41, p. 457 A):  "Not in vain was
   this rule ordained by the Apostles, that in the dread Mysteries
   remembrance should be made of the departed:  for they knew that it is a
   great gain to them, and a great benefit."

   [2492] hoi toutois diapherontes.  "Hesychius, Diapherei, anekei.  Ubi
   Kusterus ait, anekei, id est. "pertinet," vel "attinet" Routh,
   Scriptor. Eccles. Opuscula, p. 441).  Dr. Routh's note refers to Nicæni
   Conc. Can. xvi.:  hupharpasai ton to hetero diapheronta.  Cf. Synodi
   Nic. ad Alexandrinos Epist.:  diapheronta te Aigupto kai te hagiotate
   'Alexandreon ekklesia.

   [2493] According to the Ben. Ed. the meaning is not "We offer Christ,
   who was sacrificed for our sins," but "We offer for our sins Christ
   sacrificed," i.e. "Christ lying on the altar as a victim sacrificed,"
   in allusion to Apoc. V. 6, 12.  See Index, "Sacrifice."

   the two words epi and ousia, as do many others:  although the
   explanation which derives it from epiouse hemera is more probable.  We

   the word "super-substantial does not agree" (Ben. Ed.).

   [2501] Cat. xxii. § 3, note 1.  Ben. Ed. "We are not to think that
   Cyril supposed the Body of Christ to be distributed and digested into

   Body that which belongs only to the species under which It is hidden.
   Nor does he deny that those species pass into the draught, but only the
   Body of Christ."  Cf. Iren. V. ii. 2, 3, and "Eucharistic Doctrine" in
   the Introduction.

   is not tried (apeirastos) by God.'"  Resch, Agrapha, Logion 26, p. 188,
   quotes allusions to the saying in Jas. i. 12, 13; 2 Cor. xiii. 5, 6, 7,
   and concludes that it was recorded as a saying of our Lord in one of
   the un-canonical gospels (Luke i. 1), where it occurred in the context
   of the incident narrated in Matt. xxvi. 41, Mark xiv. 38.

   [2510] Cyril is here a clear witness for the reference of tou ponerou
   to "the wicked one."

   [2511] From § 14, euchomenos touto legeis, it seems probable that the
   whole Prayer was said by the people as well as by the Priest.  See
   Introduction, "Eucharistic Rites."

   [2512] Compare Waterland on this passage, c. X. p 688.

   [2513] Apost. Const. VIII. c. xiii:  "Let the Bishop speak thus to the
   people:  Holy things for holy persons.  And let the people answer:
   There is One that is holy; there is one Lord, one Jesus Christ, blessed
   for ever, to the glory of God the Father."  The Liturgies of St. James
   and of Constantinople have nearly the same words:  in the Liturgy of
   St. Mark the answer of the people is:  One Father holy, one Son holy,
   one Spirit holy, in the unity of the Holy Spirit.

   [2514] Ps. xxxiv. 9.  In the Apostolic Constitutions the "Sancta
   Sanctis" and its response are immediately followed by the "Gloria in
   excelsis," and the "Hosanna."  Then the Clergy partake, and there
   follows a direction that this Psalm xxxiv. is to be said while all the
   rest are partaking.  In the Liturgy of Constantinople there is the
   direction:  "The Choir sings the communion antiphon (to koinonikon) of
   the day or the saint."

   [2515] For me epitrepete, probably an itacism, we should read me
   epitrepetai, as a question, the propriety of the change being indicated
   by the answer ouchi.  "Is the judgment of this entrusted to the bodily
   palate?  No, but, &c."

   [2516] antitupou somatos, "the antitypical Body," not "the antitype of
   the Body," which would require tou somatos.  Cf. Cat. xxi. § 1, note 6.

   [2517] Cat. xviii. 32:  "with what reverence and order you must go from
   Baptism to the Holy Altar of God."

   [2518] Cyril appears to be the earliest authority for thus placing the
   hands in the form of a Cross.  A similar direction is given in the
   101st Canon of the Trullan Council (692), and by Joh. Damasc. (De Fid.
   Orthod. iv. 14).  Dict. Chr. Ant. "Communion."  That the communicant
   was to receive the Bread in his own hands is clear from the language of
   Cyril and other Fathers.  Cf. Clem. Alex. Strom. I. c. i. § 5:  "Some
   after dividing the Eucharist according to custom allow each of the
   laity himself to take his part."  See the passage of Origen quoted in
   the next note, and Tertull. Cor. Mil. c. iii.  "The Sacrament of the
   Eucharist, which the Lord commanded both (to be taken) at meal-times
   and by all, we take even in assemblies before dawn, and from the hand
   of none but the presidents."

   [2519] Origen. Hom. xiii. in Exod. § 3:  "I wish to admonish you by
   examples from your own religion:  ye, who have been accustomed to
   attend the Sacred Mysteries, know how, when you receive the Body of the
   Lord, you guard it with all care and reverence, that no little part of
   it fall down, no portion of the consecrated gift slip away.  For you
   believe yourselves guilty, and rightly so believe, if any part thereof
   fall through carelessness."

   [2520] kupton, not kneeling, but standing in a bowing posture.  Cf.
   Bingham, XV. c. 5, § 3.

   [2521] Apost. Const. VIII. c. 13:  "Let the Bishop give the Oblation
   (prosphoran) saying, The Body of Christ.  And let him that receiveth
   say, Amen.  And let the Deacon hold the Cup, and when he delivers it
   say, The Blood of Christ, the Cup of Life.  And let him that drinketh
   say, Amen."

   [2522] Cat. xxi. 3, note 8.

   [2523] In the Liturgy of St. James, after all have communicated, "The
   Deacons and the People say:  Fill our mouths with Thy praise, O Lord,
   and fill our lips with joy, that we may sing of Thy glory, of Thy
   greatness, all the day.  And again:  We render thanks to Thee, Christ
   our God, that Thou hast accounted us worthy to partake of Thy Body and
   Blood, &c."

   Prolegomena.

   ------------------------

   Section I.--The Life.

   S. Gregory Nazianzen, called by the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus "The
   Great," and universally known as "The Theologian" or "The Divine," a
   title which he shares with S. John the Evangelist alone among the
   Fathers of the Church, was, like the great Basil of Cæsarea and his
   brother Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, by birth a Cappadocian.  He was born
   at Arianzus, a country estate belonging to his father, in the
   neighbourhood of Nazianzus.

   This latter, sometimes called Nazianzum, is a place quite unknown to
   early writers, and derives all its importance from its connection with
   our Saint.  The Romans seem to have called it Diocæsarea.  This would
   place it in the south-western portion of the district called Cappadocia
   Secunda, a sub-division of the Province, which had previously included
   the whole country of Cappadocia under the Prefect of Cæsarea.  The
   Emperor Valens made the division for financial purposes about a.d. 371,
   and assigned Tyana as its civil Metropolis, and, as we shall see,
   thereby caused an ecclesiastical quarrel which had considerable effect
   on the life of S. Gregory.  Tyana was situated at no great distance
   south and east of Nazianzus, which place is usually identified with
   some interesting ruins about eighteen miles south-east of Ak Serai, on
   a rocky platform at the foot of the mountains called Hassan Dagh.
   Amongst other ruined buildings here are the remains of three Byzantine
   churches of great age, but more recent than the rest of the town.

   His father, who bore the same name with himself, had originally
   belonged to an obscure sect called Hypsistarians or Hypsistians, of
   whom we know little except what we learn from Gregory of Nazianzus and
   his namesake of Nyssa.  They seem to have held a sort of syncretist
   doctrine, containing elements derived from heathen, Christian, and
   Jewish sources.  They were very strict monotheists, rejecting both
   polytheism and the doctrine of the Trinity, and worshipping the One
   Supreme Being under the names of The Most High and The Almighty, and
   the emblems of Fire and Light, but with no external cultus; for they
   rejected sacrifice and every outward form of worship, holding adoration
   to be an exclusively interior and spiritual act.  With singular
   inconsistency, however, they adopted the observance of the Jewish
   Sabbath, and the Levitical prohibition of certain kinds of food.  They
   were but few in number, and their influence was insignificant even in
   Cappadocia, which was the headquarters of sect. [2525]   From this form
   of error the elder Gregory was converted by the influence of his wife,
   Nonna; and soon after his conversion was consecrated to the bishopric
   of Nazianzus.

   Nonna, the mother of our Saint, was the daughter of Christian parents,
   and had been very carefully brought up.  Like S. John Chrysostom and S.
   Augustine, Gregory had the inestimable advantage of being reared at the
   knee of a mother of conspicuous holiness.  There were three children of
   the marriage--a sister, Gorgonia, probably somewhat older than Gregory,
   who was devotedly fond of her, and a brother, Cæsarius, perhaps
   younger, who was a distinguished physician, and occupied a post of
   confidence at the Court of Constantinople.  Gregory was certainly born
   at a late period of the life of his mother.  He tells us that, like so
   many other holy men of whom we read both in the Bible and outside its
   pages, he was consecrated to God by his mother even before his birth.
   The precise date is uncertain.  There are two lines in his poem on his
   own life which seem to indicate clearly that it took place after his
   father's elevation to the Episcopate, or at any rate after his
   ordination to the Priesthood.  Speaking of the great desire of the
   elder Gregory to see his son ordained to the Priesthood, in order that
   he might have him as a coadjutor and aid to his own declining years and
   failing strength, he gives the arguments by which the old man sought to
   persuade him to take upon himself a burden which he dreaded; and among
   them we find the father saying to the son: [2526]   "You have not been
   yet so long in life as I have spent in sacrifice."  And though the
   Roman Catholic writers on the subject strain every nerve to get rid of
   the obvious meaning, by ingenious manipulation of the text or by
   far-fetched interpretations, yet the conclusion remains unshaken, and
   is supported also by another passage, to be cited presently, that he
   was at any rate born during the Priesthood of his father.  He tells us
   that he left Athens in or about his thirtieth year, [2527] and also
   that the Emperor Julian was his contemporary there.  Now Julian was at
   Athens in 355; so that we must place Gregory's birth not earlier than
   325; and if we give its natural meaning to the first passage quoted,
   not earlier than 330, the latest date available for his father's
   consecration as Bishop.  This is not inconsistent with the Athenian
   chronology of his life, as he certainly spent many years there, and
   probably did not leave the place till 357.

   As soon as the children's age permitted, Gregory and his brother
   Cæsarius were sent to school at Cæsarea, under the care of a good man
   named Carterius, who as long as he lived retained a great influence
   over the mind of his elder pupil.  This is perhaps the same Carterius
   who afterwards presided over the monasteries of Antioch in Syria, and
   was one of the instructors of S. John Chrysostom.  The following is a
   free rendering of one of four funeral epigrams written in later years
   by our Saint in honour of his old friend and tutor:

   "Whither, Carterius, best beloved of friends,

   O whither hast thou gone, and left me here

   Alone amid the many toils of earth?

   Thou who didst hold the rudder of my youth,

   When in another land I learned to weigh

   The words and stories of a learned age;

   Thou who didst bind me to the uncarnal life.

   Truly the Christ, whom thou possessest now,

   Took thee unto Himself, the King thou lov'st.

   O thou bright lightning of most glorious Christ,

   Thou best protection of my early days,

   Thou charioteer of all my younger life,

   Remember now the Gregory whom erst

   Thou trainedst in the ways of virtuous life,

   Carterius, master of the life of grace."

   It was probably at Cæsarea that the acquaintance between Gregory and S.
   Basil the Great began, which was afterwards to ripen into a lifelong
   friendship.  But their association did not last long at this period,
   for Basil soon went to Constantinople to continue his education, while
   Gregory and his brother removed to the Palestinian Cæsarea; probably as
   much for the sake of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, as for
   the advantage of the schools of that learned resort.  Cæsarius soon
   went on to Alexandria; but Gregory was tempted by the flourishing
   Palestinian school of rhetoric to remain a while and study that art.
   One of his fellow-students here was Euzoius, the future heresiarch.
   From Palestine he too went on to Alexandria, where he found his brother
   enjoying an excellent character, and highly distinguished among the
   students of the University.  S. Athanasius was at this time the Bishop,
   and Didymus head of the famous Catechetical School; but as Gregory,
   though one of his orations is a panegyric on S. Athanasius, does not
   mention having ever met either of these two great men, we must suppose
   that the former was at this time suffering one of his many periods of
   exile--his second banishment lasted from 340 to 347.  Gregory does not
   seem to have remained very long at Alexandria; the fascination
   exercised on his mind by a yet more famous seat of
   learning--Athens--soon drew him thither.  He could not even wait for a
   favourable time of year, but must start at once.  He took passage in
   the month of November in a ship bound for Ægina, with some of whose
   crew he was acquainted.  They had a prosperous voyage until they were
   in sight of Cyprus, when they were assailed by a tremendous storm, and
   the ship, swept by the heavy seas, became waterlogged, and would not
   answer her helm.  At the same time the violence of the sea burst the
   water-tanks, and the ship's company were left in dire distress.
   Gregory, who was not yet baptized, was thrown into terrible distress at
   thus finding himself in peril of death while yet outside the Covenant
   of God.  In earnest prayer he renewed his self-dedication, and vowed to
   give himself wholly to the service of God, if his life might be spared
   to receive Holy Baptism.  He tells the story at some length and with
   great graphic power in his long poem on his own life, from which we
   subjoin a cento, [2528] and also in his oration spoken at his father's
   funeral (Orat. XVIII, c. 31, p. 352 Ed. Ben.).  It is, however,
   uncertain whether he was baptized immediately after this deliverance,
   or whether he waited till his return to Nazianzus.  At any rate he
   reached Athens in safety, and shortly afterwards was joined there by
   Basil; when the early acquaintance which was now renewed soon deepened
   into an intimacy of brotherly affection, which, though often sorely
   tried, never grew cold in Gregory's heart.  In the funeral oration
   which he pronounced over his friend, Gregory has left us a most
   interesting account of University life in the middle of the fourth
   century, of which we give a summary here, referring the reader for
   details to the oration itself, which will be found in the present
   volume.  Basil's reputation, he says, preceded him to Athens, where he
   was received with much enthusiasm.  Many of the silliest students there
   are mad upon Sophists, and are divided upon the respective merits of
   their teachers with as much excitement as is shown by the partisans of
   the various chariots in the Hippodromes.  And so a new-comer is laid
   hold of by them in this fashion.  First of all, he is entertained by
   the first who can get hold of him--either a relation or a friend or a
   fellow-countryman, or a leading Sophister, who is in favour with his
   master, and touts for him.  There he is unmercifully chaffed, and with
   more or less of rough horseplay, by everybody, to take down his pride;
   and is then escorted processionally through the streets to the Baths;
   after which process he is regarded as free of the students' guild.
   Basil, however, through the good offices of his friend Gregory, was
   spared this trial of his nerves, out of respect for his great
   attainments; and this kind action was the beginning of their long and
   affectionate intimacy.  Among the students, however, were a number of
   young Armenians, some of whom had been at school with Basil, and were
   very jealous of him.  These young men, with the object of destroying
   his reputation if possible, were continually harassing him with
   disputations upon hard and sophistical questions.  Basil was quite able
   to hold his own against them, but Gregory, jealous for the honour of
   his University, and not at first perceiving the malice of these young
   men, sided with them and made the conflict more equal.  As soon,
   however, as he began to see their real purpose, he forsook them and
   took his stand by his friend, whose victory was thus made not only
   assured but easy.  The young gentlemen naturally did not like this, and
   Gregory became, much to Basil's distress, very unpopular among them, as
   they chose to regard his conduct in the matter as treason against his
   University, and especially against the students of his own year.

   The city of Athens at this time was full of dangerous distractions for
   young men; feasts, theatres, assemblies, wine parties, etc.  Gregory
   and his friend resolved to renounce all these, and to allow themselves
   to know only two roads--one, that which led to the Church and its holy
   teachers; the other, that which took them to their University
   lectures.  Amongst other famous students of Gregory's day was Prince
   Julian, afterwards the Emperor who apostatized and endeavoured to
   restore the ancient heathenism, and galvanize it into something like a
   new life.  Gregory claims even at this early period to have foreseen
   and dreaded the result of Julian's accession.  "I had long foreseen,"
   he says, "how matters would be, from the time that I was with him at
   Athens.  He had come there shortly after the violent measures against
   his brother, having asked permission of the Emperor to do so.  He had
   two reasons for this sojourn--the one more honest, namely, to visit
   Greece and its schools, the other more secret and known only to a few
   persons, namely, to consult with the heathen priests and charlatans
   about his plans, because his wickedness was not as yet declared.  Even
   then I made no bad guess about the man, although I am not one of those
   skilled in such matters; but I was made a prophet by the unevenness of
   his disposition and the very unsettled condition of his mind.  I used
   these very words about him:  What an evil the Roman State is
   nourishing,'  though I prefaced them with a wish that I might prove a
   false prophet." (Orat. V. 23, 24.)  Gregory must have been a long time
   at Athens.  He seems to have gone there at about the age of eighteen,
   and not to have left till he was past thirty.  Basil left before him
   and returned to Cappadocia, and as soon as he could follow he went to
   Constantinople, where he met his brother, who had just come there to
   practice as a Court Physician, but resolved to throw up his practice
   and return with his brother to Nazianzus.  They found their parents
   still living and their father occupying the Episcopal Throne.  From
   this time onward Gregory divided his time between his parents and his
   friend, living partly at Arianzus, and partly with Basil in Pontus, in
   monastic seclusion.  At his Baptism, which it seems most probable took
   place at this period, he made a solemn vow never to swear, and to
   devote his whole energies and powers solely to the glory of God, and
   the defence and spreading of the faith.  Cæsarius did not remain long
   in the retirement of home, but soon returned to the Capital, where a
   brilliant career seemed opening before him.  Gregory, whose mind was
   strongly impressed with the dangers and temptations of a life at Court,
   did not altogether approve of this step, yet he does not very severely
   blame it.  He himself, however, felt very strongly drawn to the
   monastic life; but as retirement from the world did not seem to him to
   be his vocation, he resolved to continue to live in the world, and to
   be a help and support to his now aged parents, and especially to his
   father in the duties of his Episcopate, but at the same time to live
   under the strictest ascetic rule.  He had, however, always a secret
   hankering after the Solitary life, which he had once (Ep. i.) promised
   Basil to share with him; and he did find himself able for some years to
   spend part of his time with his friend in his retirement in the wilds
   of Pontus.  They portioned out their days very carefully between
   prayer, meditation and study, and manual labour, on the principles laid
   down by Basil in a letter to his friend, which afterwards were
   developed into the celebrated Rule still observed by the entire body of
   the Religious of the Eastern Church.  Retirement, he says, does not
   consist in the act of removal from the world in bodily presence, but in
   this, that we tear away the soul from those bodily influences which
   stir up the passions; that we give up our parental city and our
   father's house, our possessions and goods, friendship and wedlock,
   business and profession, art and science, and everything, and are quite
   ready to take into our hearts nothing but the impressions of the divine
   teaching.

   In solitude, Basil thinks, it is possible altogether to tame the
   passions, like wild beasts, by gentle treatment; to lull them to sleep,
   to disarm them.  By turning away the soul from the enticements of
   sense, and withdrawing into one's self for the contemplation of God and
   of Eternal Beauty, it is possible to raise man to a forgetfulness of
   natural wants, and to a spiritual freedom from care.  The means to this
   spiritual elevation are in his view the reading of Holy Scripture,
   which sets before us rules of life--but especially the pictures of the
   lives of godly men; Prayer which draws down the Godhead to us, and
   makes our mind a pure abode for It; and an earnest silence, more
   inclined to learn than to teach, but by no means morose or unfriendly.
   At the same time Basil desires that the outward appearance of one who
   thus practises solitude shall be in keeping with his inner life; with
   humble downcast eye, and dishevelled hair, in dirty untidy clothes he
   must go about, neither lazily loitering nor passionately quick, but
   quietly.  His garment, girt upon his loins with a belt, is to be
   coarse, not of a bright colour, suited for both summer and winter,
   close enough to keep the body warm without additional clothing; and his
   shoes adapted to their purpose, but without ornament.  For food, let
   him use only the most necessary, chiefly vegetables; for drink,
   water--at least in health.  For mealtime, which begins and ends with
   prayer, one hour is to be fixed.  Sleep is to be short, light, and
   never so dead as to let the soul be open to the impressions of
   corrupting dreams.

   They gave themselves especially to the study of Holy Scripture, and to
   the practice of devotional exercises.  In their study their great
   principle was to interpret the holy writings not by their own
   individual judgment, but on the lines laid down for them by the
   authority of ancient interpreters.  Of uninspired commentators they had
   the greatest respect for Origen, whose errors, however, they happily
   avoided.  From his exegetical writings they compiled a book of
   Extracts, which they published in twenty-seven books, to which they
   gave the name of Philocalia, i.e., what in modern language is called a
   Christology.  This is happily still extant, and is valuable as
   preserving for us many passages otherwise lost, or existing only in a
   Latin translation.  Gregory sent a copy of this work to his friend and
   subsequent companion at Constantinople, Theodore, Bishop of Tyana, as
   an Easter gift many years afterwards, and accompanied it with a letter,
   in which he speaks of the work as a memorial of himself and Basil, and
   as intended for an aid to scholars; and begs that his friend will give
   a proof of its usefulness, with the help of diligence and the Holy
   Spirit.  Socrates says that this careful study of Origen was of the
   greatest service to the two friends in their subsequent controversies
   with the Arians; for these heretics quoted him in support of their
   errors, but the two Fathers were enabled to confute them readily, by
   shewing that they were completely ignorant of the meaning of Origen's
   argument.

   But Gregory does not appear to have stayed long in Basil's
   Monastery;--although Rufinus speaks of a sojourn of thirteen years.
   This cannot for chronological reasons have been a continuous stay,
   although it is true that Basil's monastic life in Pontus, and Gregory's
   various visits to him there extended over a period of about that
   length, from his first retirement in 357 to his consecration to the
   Episcopate in 370.  It was after about three years that Gregory
   returned to Nazianzus (360), possibly, as Ullmann suggests, because of
   circumstances which had arisen at his home, which seemed to call
   imperatively for his presence in the interests of the peace of the
   Diocese, and for the assistance which he might, though a layman, be
   able to give to his aged Father, who had got into trouble through a
   piece of imprudent conduct.

   The Emperor Constantius, who was an Arian, had in 359 assembled at
   Ariminum (the modern Rimini) a Council of 400 Western Bishops, and
   these, partly duped, partly compelled by the Imperial Officers, had put
   out a Creed, which, while acknowledging the proper Deity of the Son,
   and confessing Him to be Like the Father, omitted to say Like In All
   Points, and refused the word Consubstantial; thus, while condemning the
   extreme followers of Arius, favouring the views of the Semi-Arian
   party.  At the same time another Synod, of 150 Eastern Bishops, was
   assembled under Court influence at Seleucia, and promulgated a similar
   formula.  The Bishop of Nazianzus, though still as always a staunch
   upholder of Nicene orthodoxy, was in some way induced to attach his
   signature to this compromising Creed; and this action led to most
   important consequences.  The Monks of his Diocese took the matter up
   with the usual earnestness of Religious, and, with several also of the
   Bishops, withdrew from Communion with their own Bishop.  This may have
   been the reason for his son's return.  He induced his Father to
   apologize for his involuntary error and to put out an orthodox
   Confession, and so he healed the schism.  To this period belongs his
   first Oration on Peace; in which, after an eloquent encomium on the
   Religious life, he sets forth the blessings of peace and concord, and
   contrasts them with the misery of discord; begging the people to be
   very slow indeed on this account to sever themselves from the Communion
   of those whom they think to be erring brethren; and thanking God for
   the restoration of peace.  He concludes the whole with a splendid
   setting forth of the Catholic doctrine concerning the Trinity, in the
   following terms:--

   "Would to God that none of us may perish, but that we may all abide in
   one spirit, with one soul labouring together for the faith of the
   Gospel, of one mind, minding the same thing, armed with the shield of
   faith, girt about the loins with truth, knowing only the one war
   against the Evil One, and those who fight under his orders, not fearing
   them that kill the body but cannot lay hold of the soul; but fearing
   Him Who is the Lord both of soul and body; guarding the good deposit
   which we have received from our fathers, adoring Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, knowing the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Holy
   Ghost--into which Names we were baptized, in Which we have believed,
   under Whose banner we have been enlisted ; dividing Them before we
   combine Them, and combining before we divide; not receiving the Three
   as one Person (for They are not impersonal, or names of one Person, as
   though our wealth lay in Names alone and not in facts), but the Three
   as one Thing.  For They are One, not in Person, but in Godhead, Unity
   adored in Trinity, and Trinity summed up in Unity; all adorable, all
   royal, of one throne and one glory; above the world, above time,
   uncreated, invisible, impalpable, uncircumscript; in Its relation to
   Itself known only to Itself; but to us equally venerable and adorable;
   Alone dwelling in the Holiest, and leaving all creatures outside and
   shut off, partly by the First Veil, and partly also by the Second;--by
   the first, the heavenly and angelic host, parted from Godhead; and by
   the second, we men, severed from the Angels.  This let us do; let this
   be our mind, Brethren; and those that are otherwise minded let us look
   upon as diseased in regard to the truth, and as far as may be, let us
   take and cure them; but if they be incurable let us withdraw from them,
   lest we share their disease before we impart to them our own health.
   And the God of Peace that passeth all understanding shall be with you
   in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Amen."

   Gregory the Elder was now aged and infirm, and began to feel his need
   of a Coadjutor in his pastoral duties.  So, by the great desire of the
   people of Nazianzus, he ordained his son to the Priesthood, much
   against the will of the said son.  This Ordination took place at some
   great Festival, probably at Christmas of the year 361.  Gregory the
   Younger was much aggrieved at this gentle violence, which even in after
   years he describes as an act of tyranny, and says he cannot bring
   himself to speak of it in other terms, though he asks pardon of the
   Holy Spirit for his language.  Immediately after his Ordination he made
   his escape to Pontus, apparently reaching Basil about Epiphany, 362.
   Here he had time for reflection on the obedience he now owed to his
   father, not only as son to father, but as Priest to Bishop; and with a
   truer view of his duty he returned to Nazianzus, where he was present
   in the Church on Easter day 362, and preached his first Sermon as a
   Priest, in apology for his reluctance.  Strange to say, though it was
   so great a Festival, and though the preacher was so well known and so
   much beloved in Nazianzus, the congregation was very small;--probably
   many refrained from going to Church in order to mark their feeling
   about Gregory's flight to Pontus.  Anyhow he felt the discourtesy
   keenly, and in his next sermon took occasion to reprove them severely
   for their inconsistency in receiving him so badly after having
   compelled him for their sakes to finally renounce the solitude he loved
   so well.  Of this discourse the Abbé Benoît speaks as follows:--

   "It is not very long, and it seems to us a model of the tact and art
   which a Minister of the Gospel ought to use in his speech when just
   grievances compel him to address deserved reproaches to the faithful.
   It would be impossible to blame with greater force, to complain with
   more frankness, and yet to do it in a way less offensive to the
   hearers.  Praise, indeed, is so mingled with blame in this discourse,
   and there is in its tone something so earnest and affectionate, that
   the audience, though sharply reprimanded, not only could not take
   offence, but was compelled to conceive a yet greater affection and
   admiration for him who so reproved them."

   Gregory took the opportunity to write another very long Oration as his
   apology for his flight.  In it he sets forth at great length his
   conception of the nature and responsibilities of the Priestly Office,
   and justifies himself both for having shrunk from such a charge, and
   for having so soon returned to take it up.  It is very improbable that
   this Oration, numbered II. in the Benedictine Edition, was ever
   delivered vivâ voce; but it was published, and is a complete Treatise
   on the Priesthood, used both by S. John Chrysostom as the foundation of
   his Six Books on the Priesthood, and by S. Gregory the Great as the
   basis of his Treatise on the Pastoral Rule.  It has also furnished
   material to many of the best Ecclesiastical writers of all ages.

   Julian had now succeeded to the Empire, and had entered Constantinople
   in 361.  He had by this time completely broken with the Church, and
   renounced even the outward semblance of Christianity.  He persuaded
   Cæsarius, however, to retain his position at Court, hoping perhaps that
   he might succeed in perverting him.  This was a matter of deep regret
   to his father and brother, and they felt, the latter says, obliged to
   keep the fact from the knowledge of his mother.  Gregory wrote his
   brother a letter of most affectionate though earnest remonstrance; with
   the result that Cæsarius soon made up his mind to retire, and put his
   resolution in practice on the opportunity afforded by the departure of
   the Emperor from Constantinople to assume the direction of his campaign
   against the Persians.  Nazianzus was not allowed to remain without
   attempts being made against its Christianity, for the Prefect of the
   Province was sent with an armed escort of considerable strength to
   demand possession of the Church.  But the aged Bishop, supported by his
   son and by his people, boldly refused to comply with the Imperial
   commands, and there seemed such a probability of powerful resistance
   that the Prefect felt compelled to withdraw his force, and never came
   to Nazianzus again on such an errand.  The Gregorys, father and son,
   frequently came into collision with Julian during his stay in
   Cappadocia on his way to Persia; and indeed it is not too much to say
   that the firm stand which they made on behalf of the right was, under
   God, the means of diverting the Emperor from his purpose of making a
   vehement assault upon the faith and rights of the Church in that
   Province.  As the Abbé Benoît remarks, Julian saw that he must be
   careful in dealing with a province where Christian faith was such a
   living power, and where a simple village Bishop could dare to make so
   stout a stand against Imperial Authority; but he declared his intention
   of avenging himself upon his opponents on his return from his
   expedition.  The Providence of God, however, interfered, and he never
   did return, but was defeated and killed.

   In 363 or 364 Basil, like Gregory, was ordained Priest much against his
   will.  The Bishop of Cæsarea, Metropolitan of Cappadocia, was
   Eusebius.  He had been elected in 362 by a popular clamour, while yet
   only a Catechumen, and was very unwillingly consecrated by the Bishops
   of the Province.  He felt it necessary to have at hand a Priest who by
   his skill in Theology would be a help to him in the controversies of
   the times, and he selected Basil.  But for some unknown reason,
   possibly no more than a certain jealousy of Basil's superior reputation
   and influence, within a very short time Eusebius quarrelled with him,
   and endeavoured to deprive him.  This might easily have led to a
   serious schism, had Basil been a self-seeking man, but as it was, he
   quietly retired to his Community in Pontus, accompanied by his friend
   Gregory, who, however, was not able to remain long in that congenial
   society, as his presence was still much needed by his father.  On the
   succession of Valens, an Arian, to the Throne of the Empire, Eusebius
   wrote to Gregory, entreating him to come to Cæsarea and give him the
   benefit of his advice.  Gregory, however, respectfully declined the
   invitation on the grounds of his sense of the wrong which his friend
   had suffered, and after some correspondence he succeeded in effecting a
   reconciliation between the latter and his Metropolitan, in the year
   365.

   Cæsarius meantime had returned to the Court and had received from
   Valens a valuable piece of preferment in Bithynia; but in the end of
   368 or beginning of 369, having been terrified by a great earthquake,
   during which he had been in considerable danger, he was arranging
   matters for his final retirement, when he was seized with illness, and
   very soon died, leaving all his property, which must have amounted to a
   considerable sum, to his brother in trust for the poor.  He was buried
   at Nazianzus, and on the occasion of his funeral his brother preached
   the Sermon which is numbered VIII. in the Benedictine Edition.  About
   the same time, but a little later, Gorgonia also departed, and he
   preached a funeral sermon on her too.  Eusebius of Cæsarea died in 370,
   and Basil at once wrote an urgent letter to Gregory, begging him to
   come to Cæsarea, probably in order to get him elected Archbishop.
   Gregory, however, declined to go, and he and his father exerted
   themselves to the utmost of their power to procure the election of
   Basil; the elder Gregory writing through his son two letters, one
   addressed to the people of Cæsarea, the other to the Provincial Synod,
   urging Basil's claims very strongly.  Though ill at the time, he
   managed to convey himself to the Metropolis in time for the meeting of
   the Synod; and Basil was elected and consecrated.  Gregory wrote him a
   letter of congratulation; not, however, a very warm one; but when
   troubles began to arise he spoke out with all the fervour of their
   early friendship in support of the Archbishop.  About this time Valens
   divided the civil Province of Cappadocia into two, one of which had
   Cæsarea, the other Tyana, for its Metropolis.  Anthimus, Bishop of the
   latter See, thereupon claimed to be ipso facto Metropolitan of the new
   Province, a claim which Basil strenuously resisted, as savouring of
   what we call Erastianism.  A long dispute followed, in the course of
   which Basil, to assert his rights as Metropolitan, and to strengthen
   his own hands, erected several new Bishoprics in the disputed Province;
   and to one of these, Sasima, a miserable little village he consecrated
   his friend Gregory, almost by force.  Gregory was, not unnaturally,
   indignant at this treatment; while Basil, whose great object had been
   to strengthen himself against Anthimus, took it as unkind of Gregory to
   be so reluctant to comply with his friend's wishes.  So the two were
   for a long time in very strained relations to one another.  Although,
   however, Gregory ultimately yielded to the earnest wish of his father,
   and submitted to the authority of the Archbishop, yet he did not
   disguise his reluctance, and in the Sermons which he preached on the
   occasion (Or. ix. x.) he spoke very strongly on the point.  Anthimus,
   however, occupied the village of Sasima with troops, and prevented
   Gregory from taking peaceable possession of his See, which it is
   probable he never actually administered, for his father begged him to
   remain at Nazianzus and continue his services as coadjutor Bishop.  The
   contest about the Metropolitanate of Tyana went on for some time, but
   in the end, mainly by Gregory's mediation, it was amicably settled.  In
   374 Gregory the elder died, and his wife also, and thus our Saint was
   set free from the charge of the diocese.  He spoke a panegyric at his
   father's funeral, and wrote a number of little "In Memoriam" poems to
   his mother's memory; and out of respect for his father continued to
   administer the See of Nazianzus for about a year, making great efforts
   meanwhile to secure the appointment of a Bishop.  But, perceiving that
   his efforts would be fruitless, because of the devotion of the people
   to himself, he at length withdrew, after a very serious illness, to
   Seleucia in Isauria (375,) where he lived three or four years, attached
   to the famous Church of S. Thecla.  Very little is known of his life
   there; but it must have been at this period that he heard of the death
   of Basil, upon whom two years later in the Cathedral of Cæsarea he
   pronounced a splendid panegyric.

   In 379 the Church at Constantinople, which for forty years had been
   oppressed by a succession of Arian Archbishops, and was well nigh
   crushed out of existence by the multitude of other heresies, Eunomian,
   Macedonian, Novatian, Apollinarian, etc., which Arian rule had
   fostered, besought the great Theologian to come to their aid.
   Theodosius the new Emperor, who was a fervent Catholic, backed their
   entreaty, as did also numerous Bishops.  Gregory resisted the call for
   a long time; but at last he came to see that it was the will of God
   that he should accept the Mission, and he consented to go and fill the
   gap, until such time as the Catholics of the Capital might be able to
   elect an Archbishop.

   The following account of the religious condition of Constantinople at
   this time is condensed from Ullmann:--

   "Religious feeling like everything else had become to the idle and
   empty mind a subject of joke and amusement.  What belonged to the
   theatre was brought into the Church, and what belonged to the Church
   into the theatre.  The better Christian feelings were not seldom held
   up in comedies to the sneer of the multitude.  Everything was so
   changed by the Constantinopolitans into light jesting, that earnestness
   was stripped of its worth by wit, and that which is holy became a
   subject for banter and scoffing in the refined conversation of worldly
   people.  Yet worse was it that the unbridled delight of these men in
   dissipating enjoyments threatened to turn the Church into a theatre,
   and the Preacher into a play actor.  If he would please the multitude,
   he must adapt himself to their taste, and entertain them amusingly in
   the Church.  They demanded also in the preaching something that should
   please the ear, glittering declamation with theatrical gesticulation;
   and they clapped with the same pleasure the comedian in the holy place
   and him on the stage.  And alas there were found at that period too
   many preachers who preferred the applause of men to their souls'
   health.  At this period the objects of the faith excited, particularly
   in Constantinople, a very universal and lively interest, which was
   entertained from the Court downwards, though not always in the most
   creditable manner; but it was in great part not the interest of the
   heart, but that of a hypercritical and disputatious intellect, where it
   was not something far lower, to which the dispute about matters of
   faith served only as a pretext for attaining the exterior aims of
   avarice or ambition.  While the sanctifying and beatifying doctrines of
   the Gospel, which are directed to the conversion of the whole inner man
   were let lie quiet, everyone from the Emperor to the beggar busied
   himself with incredible interest about a few questions concerning which
   the Gospel communicates only just so much as is beneficial to the human
   spirit and necessary to salvation, and whose fuller expression at any
   rate belongs rather to the school than to practical life.  But the more
   violently these doctrinal disputes were kindled, disturbing and
   dividing States, cities, and families, so much the more people lost
   sight of the practical essentials of Christianity; it seemed more
   important to maintain the Tri-unity of God than to love God with all
   the heart; to acknowledge the Consubstantiality of the Son, than to
   follow Him in humility and self-denial; to defend the Personality of
   the Holy Spirit, than to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, love,
   peace, righteousness....In addition to these religious disputes came
   also political struggles, namely, the hard-fought wars of the Roman
   Empire with the Goths; so that the Empire at large presented the
   picture of a sea, tossed by violent storms.  But the unhappy schisms
   which at this time were severing Christians everywhere, shewed
   themselves in a particularly discouraging form in the Capital.  Under
   the late reigns several parties had been favoured; but especially those
   which, though again divided among themselves by differences of opinion,
   yet agreed in this that they all rejected the Nicene system of
   doctrine.  Constantius had bestowed his favour on the Arians; Julian
   during his short reign on all parties, at least in appearance,--to
   crush them all.  After Jovian's early death Valens succeeded to power
   in the East, and with him, even more than with Constantius, Arianism,
   which he not only protected, but also sought to make predominant by
   horrible atrocities against the friends of the Nicene Decrees.  These
   had now been forbidden the use of all Churches and Church property, and
   the Arians had been put in possession of them.  But Constantinople
   still remained the scene of ecclesiastical strifes and partizanships.
   Here where with a little good so much evil flowed from all three parts
   of the world, all opinions had their adherents; but the following
   parties in particular shewed themselves:--The Eunomians, professing an
   intellectual theology, which claimed to be able completely to explore
   the Being of God by logical definitions, and maintained in strict Arian
   fashion the Unlikeness of the Son to the Father, were very numerous in
   Constantinople (as is shewn by the fact that most of Gregory's
   polemical utterances were directed against them), and injured earnest
   religious thought principally by this, that they used the doctrines of
   the faith exclusively as subjects for an argumentative dialectic.  The
   Macedonians, addicted to the Semi-Arian dogma of the Like Substance,
   and thereby somewhat more nearly approaching the Orthodox, and
   distinguished besides by an estimable earnestness of demeanour, and a
   monk-like strictness of manner, were indeed themselves excluded by the
   pure Arians from the property of the Church, but were ever being
   abundantly multiplied, partly in Constantinople itself, partly in the
   neighbouring regions of the Hellespont, Thrace, Bithynia, and Phrygia.
   The Novatians, who even overstepped the Macedonians in the strictness
   of their practical principles, had somewhat earlier been on the point
   of uniting themselves with the Orthodox, from whom they did not differ
   on the chief doctrine in dispute, and with whom they found themselves
   under like oppression from the Arians; but the malevolent disposition
   of a few of the party leaders had stood in the way, and so they
   remained separate, and swelled the number of the opponents of
   Orthodoxy.  Lastly the Apollinarians too began to establish themselves
   there.  Their teaching was opposed to the acknowledgment of true and
   perfect Manhood in Jesus (for true Manhood lies in the reason
   especially); and there was at that time, as Gregory informs us, a
   report that an assembly of Apollinarian bishops was to be held at
   Constantinople, with a view of raising their teaching as to Christ into
   general notice, and forcing it upon the Churches.

   In such a crisis Gregory came most unwillingly to the Capital.  At
   first he lodged in the house of a relation of his own, part of which he
   arranged as a Chapel, and dedicated under the title Anastasia, as the
   place where the Catholic faith was to rise again.  There he began at
   once to carry out the rule of the Church as to daily service, to which
   he added his own splendid preaching.

   His constant theme was the worship of the Trinity.  After two Sermons
   in deprecation of religious contentiousness, he preached those famous
   Five Orations which have won for him the title of the Theologian.  To
   analyse these belongs to another portion of this work; it will be
   enough in this place to say, that after warning his audience against
   the frivolity with which the Arians were dragging religious subjects of
   the most solemn kind into the most unsuitable places and occasions, he
   proceeds in four magnificent discourses to set forth the Catholic
   doctrine of the Trinity, shewing carefully the difference between
   Sabellian confusion of Persons and Tritheistic division of Substance.
   The Arians, however, persecuted him bitterly; even, on one occasion at
   least, hiring an assassin to murder him; and their persecution was all
   the more bitter because of the wonderful success which attended
   Gregory's preaching.  S. Jerome, who came to Constantinople at this
   time, has left on record the pleasure with which he listened to and
   conversed with the great Defender of the Faith.

   Unfortunately Gregory now let himself be taken in by a plausible
   adventurer named Maximus, who had come to Constantinople in the hope of
   obtaining the Bishopric for himself.  He attached himself to Gregory
   and won his confidence, the latter even going so far as to deliver a
   panegyric upon him as a sufferer for the Faith.  After a short time,
   however, Maximus managed to procure his own consecration secretly from
   some Egyptian Bishops, who during an illness of Gregory enthroned him
   at night in the Church.  In the morning, when the people discovered
   what had been done, they were very indignant, and Maximus and his
   friends were driven out of the Church and forced to leave the City.
   Meanwhile the rank and fashion of Constantinople began to dislike
   Gregory, who would not condescend to the arts of the popular preacher,
   and whose simple retiring life and gentle demeanour were made matter of
   reproach to him.  Gregory was quite willing to retire, and was only
   prevented from doing so by the earnest remonstrances of his friends,
   who solemnly assured him that if he went away the Faith would depart
   with him; so he consented to remain till a fitter man could be found.
   Late in 380 Theodosius came to Constantinople, where almost his first
   act was to deprive the Arians of the Churches, and to put Gregory in
   possession of the Cathedral of S. Sophia.  The next year the great
   Council of Eastern Bishops, which ranks as the Second Ecumenical
   Council, met at the Capital, under the presidency of Meletius of
   Antioch.  Its first care was to sanction the translation of Gregory
   from the See of Sasima to that of the Metropolis of the Empire, and to
   enthrone him in S. Sophia, and thus he became the recognised Archbishop
   of the Imperial City.  Meletius shortly afterwards died, and Gregory
   assumed the Presidency of the Council.  He failed in his endeavours to
   heal the schism which was troubling the Church of Antioch, and when the
   Egyptian Bishops on their arrival shewed a disposition to take up the
   case of Maximus, and were determined at any rate to oust Gregory from
   the Patriarchal Throne on the ground of a Nicene canon forbidding
   translations, which had virtually been rescinded by the act of the
   Council, he made up his mind to resign.  He obtained a reluctant assent
   to this course from the Emperor, and then took leave of the Synod in
   one of the most magnificent of all his Orations, in which he gives a
   graphic account of his work in the Metropolis.  Nectarius, Prefect of
   the City, who was only a catechumen, was elected in his place, and
   Gregory went home to Nazianzus.  He administered the affairs of the
   Church there for a little while, and then, having procured the election
   of Eulalius as Bishop, he retired to Arianzus, where he passed the few
   remaining years of his life in seclusion, but still continued to take
   an active interest in the affairs of the Church.  His own city was
   greatly disturbed by Apollinarian teachers, whose efforts to establish
   themselves within the Church were very persevering.  Apollinarius, or
   as he is frequently called in the West, Apollinaris, was a Bishop of
   Laodicea in the latter half of the Fourth Century, and was at one time
   greatly respected for his learning and orthodoxy by S. Athanasius and
   S. Basil.  He was even an instructor of S. Jerome in 374, but he
   seceded from the Church in the next year, owing to views which he had
   come to hold about the nature of our Lord; these really prepared the
   way for various forms of the Monophysite heresy.  He fell into the
   error of a partial denial of our Lord's true Humanity, attributing to
   Christ a human body and a human soul, but not a reasoning spirit, whose
   place, according to him, was supplied by the Divine Logos.  This view
   had first appeared in 362, when it came before a Council at
   Alexandria.  Those who were accused of holding it denied it, and
   expressed their sense of the absurdity of such a view, pointing out
   that our Lord could not be said to be really incarnate if He had no
   human mind; but about 369 it assumed a definite form (though even then
   it was not known to be the teaching of Apollinarius).  Arguing from the
   Divinity of Christ that He cannot have had a human mind, for if He had
   He would have had sinful inclinations, and the one Christ would have
   been two persons, Apollinarius and his followers went on to maintain
   that the Incarnation only meant a certain converse between God and Man;
   and that Christ's Body was not really born of Mary, but was a part of
   the Godhead converted into flesh.  S. Athanasius wrote two Books
   against these two propositions, but did not name Apollinarius, most
   probably because he did not believe him to be committed to them.  The
   fundamental error of the system was the idea that the Incarnation was,
   not the Union of the two Natures, but only a blending so close, that in
   the mind of these teachers all the Divine Attributes were transferred
   to the human nature, and all the human ones to the Divine, and the two
   were merged in one compound being.

   In 377 a Roman Synod excommunicated Apollinarius and his adherents, and
   S. Damasus wrote a letter containing twenty-five anathemas, which he
   sent to Paulinus of Antioch and others.  This condemnation is in almost
   the identical words used by S. Gregory in the first of two letters on
   the question which he wrote to Cledonius, a Priest of Nazianzus, and
   which were adopted as symbolic at the Councils of Ephesus and
   Chalcedon.  Of these letters Canon Bright says that they belong to that
   class of documents of the Fourth Century which refuted by anticipation
   the heresies of the Fifth.  Gregory affirmed True Godhead and True
   Manhood to be combined in the One Person of the Crucified, Who was the
   adorable Son, Whose Mother was the Mother of God, and Who assumed, in
   order to redeem it, the entire nature that fell in Adam.  In his
   seclusion, says Mr. Crake, his sole luxuries were a garden and a
   fountain.  He spent his last days in continual devotion.  His knees
   were worn with kneeling, and his whole thoughts and aspirations had
   gone before to the long home to which he was hastening.  After the
   manner of the Saints, he was very rigorous in his self-denial.  His bed
   was of straw with a covering of sackcloth, and a single tunic was all
   the outward clothing of him who had been Bishop of Constantinople.  Yet
   his glory was only in the Lord.  "As a fish cannot swim without water,
   and a bird cannot fly without air, he said, so a Christian cannot
   advance a single step without Christ."  He died in 391, and in the same
   year that he passed from the roll of the earthly episcopate Augustine
   was ordained Priest at Hippo Regius in Africa.

   Ullmann gives the following description of his character and personal
   appearance:

   "Gregory was of middle height and somewhat pale; but his pallor became
   him.  His hair was thick and blanched by age, his short beard and
   conspicuous eyebrows were thicker.  On his right eye he had a scar.
   His manner was friendly and attractive; his conduct simple.  The
   keynote of his inner being was piety; his soul was full of fiery
   strength of faith, turned to God and Christ; a lofty zeal for divine
   things led him all his life.  This zeal manifested itself above all in
   a steadfast adherence to and defence of certain dogmas which that age
   held to be specially important; as well as in lively conflicts, not
   always free from partisanship, with opposing convictions; but not less
   in a hearty and living apprehension of practical Christianity, the
   establishment and enlargement of which in men's minds was to him all
   important.  His asceticism was overdone; it injured his health; yet it
   did not degenerate into hypocrisy; it was to him the means for
   elevating and liberating the mind, but not in and for its own sake a
   higher virtue.  An inborn and inbred love of solitude hindered him from
   turning all his powers to a publicly useful activity.  His seclusion
   did not allow him to become familiar with the knowledge of men and of
   the world; lacking in knowledge of men, carelessly confident, sometimes
   distrustful and bitter in his judgment of others, he demanded from
   others much, but from himself most.  Susceptible of great resolves, and
   full of fiery zeal for all good, he was not always steadfast and
   persevering in carrying them out.  In endurance and conflict he was
   noble and high-minded; in victory moderate; in prosperity humble; never
   flattering the great, but an ever ready helper to the oppressed and
   persecuted, and to the poor a loving father.  The most excellent
   qualities were in Gregory mingled with faults; he was not quite free
   from vanity, he was very irritable and sensitive, but also readily
   forgave and cherished no grudges.  He was a man feeling after holiness,
   and striving after the highest good, but not perfect, as no man upon
   earth is."

   Before leaving Constantinople he made his will, in which he bequeathed
   all his property to the Deacon Gregory for life, with reversion to the
   poor of Nazianzus.

   [2526] Carm. de vita sua, 511.

   [2527] Ib. 339.

   [2528] What time I parted from Egyptian shores, Whence I had somewhat
   culled of ancient lore, We weighed, and under Cyprus cut the waves In a
   straight course for Hellas, when there rose A mighty strife of winds,
   and shook the ship; And all was night; earth, seas, and darkened skies;
   And thunders echoed to the lightning's shock. Whistled the rigging of
   the swelling sails, And bent the mast; the helm had lost its power, For
   none could hold it in the raging seas. The ship was filled with
   overwhelming waves; Mingled the shout of sailor, and the cries Of
   helmsman, captain, and of passenger, And those who till that fearful
   hour had been Unconscious of a God; for fear can teach. And, worst of
   all our dread impending woes, No water had we, for the ship began To
   labour, and the beakers soon were broke Which held our treasure of
   sweet water scant; And famine fought with surging and with storm To
   slay us.  But God sent a swift release. For Punic sailors suddenly
   appeared, Who in their own sore terror soon perceived By our sad cries
   our danger, and with oars (For they were strong) came up and saved our
   barque And us, who now all but sea-corpses were; Like fish forsaken of
   their native wave, Or lamp that dies for want of nourishment. But while
   we all were fearing sudden death, Mine was a worse, because a secret,
   fear. The cleansing waters ne'er had passed on me, That slay our foe
   and join us to our God. This was my lamentation, this my dread. For
   this I stretched my hands and cried to God, And cried above the noise
   of surging waves, And rent my clothes, and lay in misery. But, though
   ye scarce believe it, yet tis true, All those on whom our common danger
   pressed Forgot themselves, and came and prayed with me. And Thou wast
   then, O Christ, my great defence, Who now deliverest from the storm of
   life. For when no good hope dawned upon our eyes, Nor isle, nor
   continent, nor mountain top, Nor torch, nor star to light the mariners,
   Nor small nor great of earthly things appeared, What port was left for
   troubled sailor-folk? Despairing of all else, I look to thee; Life,
   breath, salvation, light, and strength to men, Who frightest, smitest,
   smilest, healest all, And ever weavest good from human ill. I call to
   mind Thy wonders of old time, By which we recognize Thy mighty hand;
   The sea divided--Israel's host brought through-- Their foes defeated by
   Thy lifted hand-- And Egypt crushed by scourges, chiefs and all--
   Nature subdued, and walls thrown down by shout. And, adding mine to
   those old famous acts, Thine own, I said, am I, both erst and now;
   Twice shalt Thou take me for Thine own, a gift Of earth and sea, a
   doubly hallowed gift, By prayers of mother and by fateful sea. To Thee
   I live, if I escape the waves, And gain baptismal dews; and Thou wilt
   lose A faithful servant if Thou cast me off, E'en now Thine own
   disciple, in the deep; Shake off for me Thy slumber, and arise, And
   stay my fear.  So prayed I--and the noise Of winds grew still, the
   surges ceased, the ship Held straight upon her course; my prayer was
   heard.

   Division II.--The Writings.

   I.  The Orations.--These--forty-five in number--raise him to equality
   with the best Orators of antiquity.

   a.  The Five Theological Orations.--These won him the title of The
   Theologian.  They were delivered in Constantinople, in defence of the
   Church's faith in the Trinity, against Eunomians and Macedonians.  In
   the First and Second he treats of the existence, nature, being, and
   attributes of God, so far as man's finite intellect can comprehend
   them.  In the Third and Fourth the subject is the Godhead of the Son,
   which he establishes by exposition of Scripture, and by refutation of
   the specious arguments brought forward by the heretics.  In the Fifth
   he similarly maintains the Deity, and Personality of the Holy Ghost.

   b.  The Two Invectives against Julian.--These were delivered at
   Nazianzus after the death of the Emperor, and present us with a very
   dark picture of his character.  The orator dwells upon his attempt to
   rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem, and its failure, and his overthrow in
   the campaign against Persia.  From these facts he demonstrates the
   power of God's Justice, and sets forth the Christian doctrine of the
   Divine Providence inculcating a lesson of trust in God.

   c.  Moral Orations.--(1)  The Apology for his flight.  As was said
   above, it is most probable that this discourse was never actually
   spoken; if it was, it certainly must have been considerably enlarged
   afterwards.  In it Gregory dwells on the motive of his flight and his
   return after his forced ordination; he speaks of his love of
   retirement, but most of all lays stress upon the difficulty of the
   Priestly Office, its heavy responsibilities and grave dangers, and upon
   his own sense of unworthiness.  His return, he says, was prompted by
   respect for his hearers and by care for his aged parents; by the fear
   of losing his father's blessing; and by the recollection of what befel
   the Prophet Jonas on account of his resistance to the will of God.  The
   remainder of the Oration is practically a treatise on the Priesthood,
   and was made use of by S. Chrysostom and S. Gregory the Great in their
   books on the subject.

   (2)  The Farewell Oration at Constantinople, containing an account of
   his work there.

   (3)  On Love of the Poor.

   (4)  On the Indissolubility of Marriage, the only Sermon of S. Gregory
   on a definite text which has come down to us.

   (5)  Three Orations on Peace.

   (6)  One on Moderation in theological discussion.

   d.  The Festal Orations.--On Christmas, Epiphany (on the Baptism of
   Christ in the river Jordan, followed up next day by a long one on Holy
   Baptism), two on Easter (one of these his first sermon, the other
   almost if not quite his last).  On Low Sunday, and on Pentecost.

   e.  Panegyrics on Saints.--The Maccabee Brothers and their Mother; S.
   Cyprian of Carthage (in which there is evidence of the cultus of the
   Blessed Virgin Mary and of the practice of invocation of the Saints);
   and on S. Athanasius.

   f.  Funeral Orations on Eminent People.--On his Father, preached before
   his Mother and S. Basil.  On Cæsarius, in presence of his parents,
   consoling them by the picture of his brother's virtue, especially in
   having withstood Julian's efforts to pervert him, and in resigning his
   post at Court and leaving the Capital.  On Gorgonia, whom he praises as
   a model Christian Matron, and whose wonderful cure before the Altar he
   relates.  On S. Basil.

   g.  Occasional Orations, of which we mention three:  (1)  On a plague
   of hail.  (2)  On the consecration of Eulalius of Doara.  (3)  On his
   own consecration to Sasima.

   II.  The Letters, of which two hundred and forty-three are extant, are
   characterised by a clear, concise, and pleasant style and spirit.  Some
   of them treat of the theological questions of the day, as for example
   the two to Cledonius, and one to Nectarius his Successor in the See of
   Constantinople; these deal with the Apollinarian errors.  Most of them
   however are letters to private friends; sometimes of condolence or
   congratulation, sometimes of recommendation, sometimes on mere general
   subjects of interest.  To this section must be ascribed his Will, which
   is probably genuine.

   III.  The Poems, five hundred and seven in number, are in various
   metres.  While leaving much to be desired, these verses shew much real
   poetic feeling, and at times rise to genuine beauty.  Thirty-eight are
   dogmatic, on the Trinity, on the works of God in Creation, on
   Providence, on Angels and Men, on the Fall, on the Decalogue, on the
   Prophets Elias and Elissæus, on the Incarnation, the Miracles and
   Parables of our Lord, and the canonical Books of the Bible.  Forty are
   Moral; two hundred and six Historical and Autobiographical; one hundred
   and twenty-nine are Epitaphs, or rather funeral Epigrams; ninety-four
   are Epigrams.

   There is also a long Tragedy, called Christus Patiens which is the
   first known attempt at a Christian drama; the parts are sustained by
   Christ, The Blessed Virgin, S. Joseph, S. Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus,
   Pontius Pilate, Theologus, Nuntius, and others.  The Benedictine
   Editors however doubt the genuineness of this Tragedy and Caillau, who
   published the second volume of this Edition after the troubles of the
   French Revolution, thinks it is to be ascribed to another Gregory,
   Bishop of Antioch in the Sixth Century, and relegates it to an
   Appendix.  None of The Theologian's Odes or Hymns have, however, found
   a place in the liturgical poetry of the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Division III.--Literature.

   There are perhaps more MSS. of the works of Gregory than of any other
   Father.  The great Benedictine Edition of his works contains long lists
   of MSS., and of Versions, and previous Editions.  The most famous of
   these is that of the Abbat Jacobus Billius in 1589, which was
   accompanied by the Scholia of Nicetas, etc.  In 1571 Leuvenklavius
   published an edition at Basle containing the Scholia of Elias Cretensis
   and others.  In 1778 appeared the first volume of the great Edition of
   the Benedictine Fathers of the Abbey of S. Maur near Paris, which had
   been in preparation ever since 1708.  But the Monks were driven away by
   the French Revolution, and the second volume did not appear till 1842.
   It has been reprinted in Migne's "Patrologia Græca," vols. 35-38.  Of
   modern works on the life and writings of our Saint, the best are those
   of Dr. Ullmann, and that of the Abbé Benoît.  A valuable comparison of
   Gregory and Basil is to be found in Newman's "Church of the Fathers,"
   and last, but not least in value, may be mentioned the long
   biographical article by Professor Watkins in Smith's "Dictionary of
   Christian Biography," and a useful short summary in Schaff's Church
   History (311-600, vol. ii.).

   Gregory Nazianzen.

   Oration I.

   On Easter and His Reluctance.

   I.  It is the Day of the Resurrection, and my Beginning has good
   auspices.  Let us then keep the Festival with splendour, [2529] and let
   us embrace one another.  Let us say Brethren, even to those who hate
   us; much more to those who have done or suffered aught out of love for
   us.  Let us forgive all offences for the Resurrection's sake:  let us
   give one another pardon, I for the noble tyranny which I have suffered
   (for I can now call it noble); and you who exercised it, if you had
   cause to blame my tardiness; for perhaps this tardiness may be more
   precious in God's sight than the haste of others.  For it is a good
   thing even to hold back from God for a little while, as did the great
   Moses of old, [2530] and Jeremiah [2531] later on; and then to run
   readily to Him when He calls, as did Aaron [2532] and Isaiah, [2533] so
   only both be done in a dutiful spirit;--the former because of his own
   want of strength; the latter because of the Might of Him That calleth.

   II.  A Mystery [2534] anointed me; I withdrew a little while at a
   Mystery, as much as was needful to examine myself; now I come in with a
   Mystery, bringing with me the Day as a good defender of my cowardice
   and weakness; that He Who to-day rose again from the dead may renew me
   also by His Spirit; and, clothing me with the new Man, may give me to
   His New Creation, to those who are begotten after God, as a good
   modeller and teacher for Christ, willingly both dying with Him and
   rising again with Him.

   III.  Yesterday the Lamb was slain and the door-posts were anointed,
   [2535] and Egypt bewailed her Firstborn, and the Destroyer passed us
   over, and the Seal was dreadful and reverend, and we were walled in
   with the Precious Blood.  To-day we have clean escaped from Egypt and
   from Pharaoh; and there is none to hinder us from keeping a Feast to
   the Lord our God--the Feast of our Departure; or from celebrating that
   Feast, not in the old leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the
   unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, [2536] carrying with us
   nothing of ungodly and Egyptian leaven.

   IV.  Yesterday I was crucified with Him; today I am glorified with Him;
   yesterday I died with Him; to-day I am quickened with Him; yesterday I
   was buried with Him; to-day I rise with Him.  But let us offer to Him
   Who suffered and rose again for us--you will think perhaps that I am
   going to say gold, or silver, or woven work or transparent and costly
   stones, the mere passing material of earth, that remains here below,
   and is for the most part always possessed by bad men, slaves of the
   world and of the Prince of the world.  Let us offer ourselves, the
   possession most precious to God, and most fitting; let us give back to
   the Image what is made after the Image.  Let us recognize our Dignity;
   let us honour our Archetype; let us know the power of the Mystery, and
   for what Christ died.

   V.  Let us become like Christ, since Christ became like us.  Let us
   become God's for His sake, since He for ours became Man.  He assumed
   the worse that He might give us the better; He became poor that we
   through His poverty might be rich; [2537] He took upon Him the form of
   a servant that we might receive back our liberty; He came down that we
   might be exalted; He was tempted that we might conquer; He was
   dishonoured that He might glorify us; He died that He might save us; He
   ascended that He might draw to Himself us, who were lying low in the
   Fall of sin.  Let us give all, offer all, to Him Who gave Himself a
   Ransom and a Reconciliation for us.  But one can give nothing like
   oneself, understanding the Mystery, and becoming for His sake all that
   He became for ours.

   VI.  As you see, He offers you a Shepherd; for this is what your Good
   Shepherd, [2538] who lays down his life for his sheep, is hoping and
   praying for, and he asks from you his subjects; and he gives you
   himself double instead of single, and makes the staff of his old age a
   staff for your spirit.  And he adds to the inanimate temple a living
   one; to that exceedingly beautiful and heavenly shrine, this poor and
   small one, [2539] yet to him of great value, and built too with much
   sweat and many labours.  Would that I could say it is worthy of his
   labours.  And he places at your disposal all that belongs to him (O
   great generosity!--or it would be truer to say, O fatherly love!) his
   hoar hairs, his youth, the temple, the high priest, the testator, the
   heir, the discourses which you were longing for; and of these not such
   as are vain and poured out into the air, and which reach no further
   than the outward ear; but those which the Spirit writes and engraves on
   tables of stone, or of flesh, not merely superficially graven, nor
   easily to be rubbed off, but marked very deep, not with ink, but with
   grace.

   VII.  These are the gifts given you by this august Abraham, this
   honourable and reverend Head, this Patriarch, this Restingplace of all
   good, this Standard of virtue, this Perfection of the Priesthood, who
   to-day is bringing to the Lord his willing Sacrifice, his only Son,
   [2540] him of the promise.  Do you on your side offer to God and to us
   obedience to your Pastors, dwelling in a place of herbage, and being
   fed by water of refreshment; [2541] knowing your Shepherd well, and
   being known by him; [2542] and following when he calls you as a
   Shepherd frankly through the door; but not following a stranger
   climbing up into the fold like a robber and a traitor; nor listening to
   a strange voice when such would take you away by stealth and scatter
   you from the truth on mountains, [2543] and in deserts, and pitfalls,
   and places which the Lord does not visit; and would lead you away from
   the sound Faith in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the One
   Power and Godhead, Whose Voice my sheep always heard (and may they
   always hear it), but with deceitful and corrupt words would tear them
   from their true Shepherd.  From which may we all be kept, Shepherd and
   flock, as from a poisoned and deadly pasture; guiding and being guided
   far away from it, that we may all be one in Christ Jesus our Lord, now
   and unto the heavenly rest.  To Whom be the glory and the might for
   ever and ever.  Amen.

   Introduction to Oration II.

   It is generally agreed that this oration was not intended for oral
   delivery.  Its object was to explain and defend S. Gregory's recent
   conduct, which had been severely criticised by his friends at
   Nazianzus.  He had been recalled by his father probably during the year
   a.d. 361 from Pontus, where he had spent several years in monastic
   seclusion with his friend S. Basil.  His father, not content with his
   son's presence at home as a support for his declining years, and
   feeling assured of his fitness for the sacred office, had proceeded,
   with the loudly expressed approval of the congregation, in spite of
   Gregory's reluctance, to ordain him to the priesthood on Christmas Day
   a.d. 361.  S. Gregory, even after the lapse of many years, speaks of
   his ordination as an act of tyranny, and at the time, stung almost to
   madness, as an ox by a gadfly, rushed away again to Pontus, to bury in
   its congenial solitude, consoled by an intimate friend's deep sympathy,
   his wounded feelings.  Before long the sense of duty reasserted itself,
   and he returned to his post at his father's side before Easter a.d.
   362.  On Easter day he delivered his first Oration before a
   congregation whose scantiness marked the displeasure with which the
   people of Nazianzus had viewed his conduct.  Accordingly he set himself
   to supply them in this Oration with a full explanation of the motives
   which had led to his retirement.  At the same time, as the secondary
   title of the Oration shows, he has supplied an exposition of the
   obligations and dignity of the Priestly Office which has been drawn
   upon by all later writers on the subject.  S. Chrysostom in his
   well-known treatise, S. Gregory the Great in his Pastoral Care, and
   Bossuet in his panegyric on S. Paul, have done little more than
   summarise the material or develop the considerations contained in this
   eloquent and elaborate dissertation.

   Oration II.

   In Defence of His Flight to Pontus, and His Return, After His
   Ordination to the Priesthood, with an Exposition of the Character of
   the Priestly Office.

   1.  I have been defeated, and own my defeat.  I subjected myself to the
   Lord, and prayed unto Him. [2544]   Let the most blessed David supply
   my exordium, or rather let Him Who spoke in David, and even now yet
   speaks through him.  For indeed the very best order of beginning every
   speech and action, is to begin from God, [2545] and to end in God.  As
   to the cause, either of my original revolt and cowardice, in which I
   got me away far off, and remained [2546] away from you for a time,
   which perhaps seemed long to those who missed me; or of the present
   gentleness and change of mind, in which I have given myself up again to
   you, men may think and speak in different ways, according to the hatred
   or love they bear me, on the one side refusing to acquit me of the
   charges alleged, on the other giving me a hearty welcome.  For nothing
   is so pleasant to men as talking of other people's business, especially
   under the influence of affection or hatred, which often almost entirely
   blinds us to the truth.  I will, however, myself, unabashed, set forth
   the truth, and arbitrate with justice between the two parties, which
   accuse or gallantly defend us, by, on the one side, accusing myself, on
   the other, undertaking my own defence.

   2.  Accordingly, that my speech may proceed in due order, I apply
   myself to the question which arose first, that of cowardice.  For I
   cannot endure that any of those who watch with interest the success, or
   the contrary, of my efforts, should be put to confusion on my account,
   since it has pleased God that our affairs should be of some consequence
   to Christians, so I will by my defence relieve, if there be any such,
   those who have already suffered; for it is well, as far as possible,
   and as reason allows, to shrink from causing, through our sin or
   suspicion, any offence or stumbling-block to the community:  inasmuch
   as we know how inevitably even those who offend one of the little ones
   [2547] will incur the severest punishment at the hands of Him who
   cannot lie.

   3.  For my present position is due, my good people, not to inexperience
   and ignorance, nay indeed, that I may boast myself a little, [2548]
   neither is it due to contempt for the divine laws and ordinances.  Now,
   just as in the body there is [2549] one member [2550] which rules and,
   so to say, presides, while another is ruled over and subject; so too in
   the churches, God has ordained, according either to a law of equality,
   which admits of an order of merit, or to one of providence, by which He
   has knit all together, that those for whom such treatment is
   beneficial, should be subject to pastoral care and rule, and be guided
   by word and deed in the path of duty; while others should be pastors
   and teachers, [2551] for the perfecting of the church, those, I mean,
   who surpass the majority in virtue and nearness to God, performing the
   functions of the soul in the body, and of the intellect in the soul; in
   order that both may be so united and compacted together, that, although
   one is lacking and another is pre-eminent, they may, like the members
   of our bodies, be so combined and knit together by the harmony of the
   Spirit, as to form one perfect body, [2552] really worthy of Christ
   Himself, our Head. [2553]

   4.  I am aware then that anarchy [2554] and disorder cannot be more
   advantageous than order and rule, either to other creatures or to men;
   nay, this is true of men in the highest possible degree, because the
   interests at stake in their case are greater; since it is a great thing
   [2555] for them, even if they fail of their highest purpose--to be free
   from sin--to attain at least to that which is second best, restoration
   from sin.  Since this seems right and just, it is, I take it, equally
   wrong and disorderly that all should wish to rule, and that no one
   should accept [2556] it.  For if all men were to shirk this office,
   whether it must be called a ministry or a leadership, the fair fulness
   [2557] of the Church would be halting in the highest degree, and in
   fact cease to be fair.  And further, where, and by whom would God be
   worshipped among us in those mystic and elevating rites which are our
   greatest and most precious privilege, if there were neither king, nor
   governor, nor priesthood, nor sacrifice, [2558] nor all those highest
   offices to the loss of which, for their great sins, men were of old
   condemned in consequence of their disobedience?

   5.  Nor indeed is it strange or inconsistent for the majority of those
   who are devoted to the study of divine things, to ascend to rule from
   being ruled, nor does it overstep the limits laid down by philosophy,
   [2559] or involve disgrace; any more than for an excellent sailor to
   become a lookout-man, and for a lookout-man, who has successfully kept
   watch over the winds, to be entrusted with the helm; or, if you will,
   for a brave soldier to be made a captain, and a good captain to become
   a general, and have committed to him the conduct of the whole
   campaign.  Nor again, as perhaps some of those absurd and tiresome
   people may suppose, who judge of others' feelings by their own, was I
   ashamed of the rank of this grade from my desire for a higher.  I was
   not so ignorant either of its divine greatness or human low estate, as
   to think it no great thing for a created nature, to approach in however
   slight degree to God, Who alone is most glorious and illustrious, and
   surpasses in purity every nature, material and immaterial alike.

   6.  What then were my feelings, and what was the reason of my
   disobedience?  For to most men I did not at the time seem consistent
   with myself, or to be such as they had known me, but to have undergone
   some deterioration, and to exhibit greater resistance and self-will
   than was right.  And the causes of this you have long been desirous to
   hear.  First, and most important, I was astounded at the unexpectedness
   of what had occurred, as people are terrified by sudden noises; and,
   losing the control of my reasoning faculties, my self-respect, which
   had hitherto controlled me, gave way.  In the next place, there came
   over me an eager longing [2560] for the blessings of calm and
   retirement, of which I had from the first been enamoured to a higher
   degree, I imagine, than any other student of letters, and which amidst
   the greatest and most threatening dangers I had promised to God, and of
   which I had also had so much experience, that I was then upon its
   threshold, my longing having in consequence been greatly kindled, so
   that I could not submit to be thrust into the midst of a life of
   turmoil by an arbitrary act of oppression, and to be torn away by force
   from the holy sanctuary of such a life as this.

   7.  For nothing seemed to me so desirable as to close the doors of my
   senses, and, escaping from the flesh and the world, collected within
   myself, having no further connection than was absolutely necessary with
   human affairs, and speaking to myself and to God, [2561] to live
   superior to visible things, ever preserving in myself the divine
   impressions pure and unmixed with the erring tokens of this lower
   world, and both being, and constantly growing more and more to be, a
   real unspotted mirror of God and divine things, as light is added to
   light, and what was still dark grew clearer, enjoying already by hope
   the blessings of the world to come, roaming about with the angels, even
   now being above the earth by having forsaken it, and stationed on high
   by the Spirit.  If any of you has been possessed by this longing, he
   knows what I mean and will sympathise with my feelings at that time.
   For, perhaps, I ought not to expect to persuade most people by what I
   say, since they are unhappily disposed to laugh at such things, either
   from their own thoughtlessness, or from the influence of men unworthy
   of the promise, who have bestowed upon that which is good an evil name,
   calling philosophy nonsense, aided by envy and the evil tendencies of
   the mob, who are ever inclined to grow worse:  so that they are
   constantly occupied with one of two sins, either the commission of
   evil, or the discrediting of good.

   8.  I was influenced besides by another feeling, whether base or noble
   I do not know, but I will speak out to you all my secrets.  I was
   ashamed of all those others, who, without being better than ordinary
   people, nay, it is a great thing if they be not worse, with unwashen
   hands, [2562] as the saying runs, and uninitiated souls, intrude into
   the most sacred offices; and, before becoming worthy to approach the
   temples, they lay claim to the sanctuary, [2563] and they push and
   thrust around the holy table, as if they thought this order to be a
   means of livelihood, instead of a pattern of virtue, or an absolute
   authority, instead of a ministry of which we must give account.  In
   fact they are almost more in number than those whom they govern;
   pitiable as regards piety, [2564] and unfortunate in their dignity; so
   that, it seems to me, they will not, as time and this evil alike
   progress, have any one left to rule, when all are teachers, instead of,
   as the promise says, taught of God, [2565] and all prophesy, [2566] so
   that even "Saul is among the prophets," [2567] according to the ancient
   history and proverb.  For at no time, either now or in former days,
   amid the rise and fall of various developments, has there ever been
   such an abundance, as now exists among Christians, of disgrace and
   abuses of this kind.  And, if to stay this current is beyond our
   powers, at any rate it is not the least important duty of religion to
   testify the hatred and shame we feel for it.

   9.  Lastly, there is a matter more serious than any which I have
   mentioned, for I am now coming to the finale [2568] of the question:
   and I will not deceive you; for that would not be lawful in regard to
   topics of such moment.  I did not, nor do I now, think myself qualified
   to rule a flock or herd, or to have authority over the souls of men.
   For in their case it is sufficient to render the herd or flock as stout
   and fat as possible; and with this object the neatherd and shepherd
   will look for well watered and rich pastures, and will drive his charge
   from pasture to pasture, and allow them to rest, or arouse, or recall
   them, sometimes with his staff, most often with his pipe; and with the
   exception of occasional struggles with wolves, or attention to the
   sickly, most of his time will be devoted to the oak and the shade and
   his pipes, while he reclines on the beautiful grass, and beside the
   cool water, and shakes down his couch in a breezy spot, and ever and
   anon sings a love ditty, with his cup by his side, and talks to his
   bullocks or his flock, the fattest of which supply his banquets or his
   pay.  But no one ever has thought of the virtue of flocks or herds; for
   indeed of what virtue are they capable?  Or who has regarded their
   advantage as more important than his own pleasure?

   10.  But in the case of man, hard as it is for him to learn how to
   submit to rule, it seems far harder to know how to rule over men, and
   hardest of all, with this rule of ours, which leads them by the divine
   law, and to God, for its risk is, in the eyes of a thoughtful man,
   proportionate to its height and dignity.  For, first of all, he must,
   like silver or gold, though in general circulation in all kinds of
   seasons and affairs, never ring false or alloyed, or give token of any
   inferior matter, needing further refinement in the fire; [2569] or
   else, the wider his rule, the greater evil he will be.  Since the
   injury which extends to many is greater than that which is confined to
   a single individual.

   11.  For it is not so easy to dye deeply a piece of cloth, or to
   impregnate with odours, foul or the reverse, whatever comes near to
   them; nor is it so easy for the fatal vapour, which is rightly called a
   pestilence, to infect the air, and through the air to gain access to
   living being, as it is for the vice of a superior to take most speedy
   possession of his subjects, and that with far greater facility than
   virtue its opposite.  For it is in this that wickedness especially has
   the advantage over goodness, and most distressing it is to me to
   perceive it, that vice is something attractive and ready at hand, and
   that nothing is so easy as to become evil, even without any one to lead
   us on to it; while the attainment of virtue is rare and difficult, even
   where there is much to attract and encourage us.  And it is this, I
   think, which the most blessed Haggai had before his eyes, in his
   wonderful and most true figure: [2570] --"Ask the priests concerning
   the law, saying:  If holy flesh borne in a garment touch meat or drink
   or vessel, will it sanctify what is in contact with it?  And when they
   said No; ask again if any of these things touch what is unclean, does
   it not at once partake of the pollution?  For they will surely tell you
   that it does partake of it, and does not continue clean in spite of the
   contact."

   12.  What does he mean by this?  As I take it, that goodness can with
   difficulty gain a hold upon human nature, like fire upon green wood;
   while most men are ready and disposed to join in evil, like stubble,
   [2571] I mean, ready for a spark and a wind, which is easily kindled
   and consumed from its dryness.  For more quickly would any one take
   part in evil with slight inducement to its full extent, than in good
   which is fully set before him to a slight degree.  For indeed a little
   wormwood most quickly imparts its bitterness to honey; while not even
   double the quantity of honey can impart its sweetness to wormwood:  and
   the withdrawal of a small pebble would draw headlong a whole river,
   though it would be difficult for the strongest dam to restrain or stay
   its course.

   13.  This then is the first point in what we have said, which it is
   right for us to guard against, viz.:  being found to be bad painters
   [2572] of the charms of virtue, and still more, if not, perhaps, models
   for poor painters, poor models for the people, or barely escaping the
   proverb, that we undertake to heal others [2573] while ourselves are
   full of sores.

   14.  In the second place, although a man has kept himself pure from
   sin, even in a very high degree; I do not know that even this is
   sufficient for one who is to instruct others in virtue.  For he who has
   received this charge, not only needs to be free from evil, for evil is,
   in the eyes of most of those under his care, most disgraceful, but also
   to be eminent in good, according to the command, "Depart from evil and
   do good." [2574]   And he must not only wipe out the traces of vice
   from his soul, but also inscribe better ones, so as to outstrip men
   further in virtue than he is superior to them in dignity.  He should
   know no limits in goodness or spiritual progress, and should dwell upon
   the loss of what is still beyond him, rather than the gain of what he
   has attained, and consider that which is beneath his feet a step to
   that which comes next:  and not think it a great gain to excel ordinary
   people, but a loss to fall short of what we ought to be:  and to
   measure his success by the commandment and not by his neighbours,
   whether they be evil, or to some extent proficient in virtue:  and to
   weigh virtue in no small scales, inasmuch as it is due to the Most
   High, "from Whom are all things, and to Whom are all things." [2575]

   15.  Nor must he suppose that the same things are suitable to all, just
   as all have not the same stature, nor are the features of the face, nor
   the nature of animals, nor the qualities of soil, nor the beauty and
   size of the stars, in all cases the same:  but he must consider base
   conduct a fault in a private individual, and deserving of chastisement
   under the hard rule of the law; while in the case of a ruler or leader
   it is a fault not to attain to the highest possible excellence, and
   always make progress in goodness, if indeed he is, by his high degree
   of virtue, to draw his people to an ordinary degree, not by the force
   of authority, but by the influence of persuasion.  For what is
   involuntary apart from its being the result of oppression, is neither
   meritorious nor durable.  For what is forced, like a plant [2576]
   violently drawn aside by our hands, when set free, returns to what it
   was before, but that which is the result of choice is both most
   legitimate and enduring, for it is preserved by the bond of good will.
   And so our law and our lawgiver enjoin upon us most strictly that we
   should "tend the flock not by constraint but willingly." [2577]

   16.  But granted that a man is free from vice, and has reached the
   greatest heights of virtue:  I do not see what knowledge or power would
   justify him in venturing upon this office.  For the guiding of man, the
   most variable and manifold of creatures, seems to me in very deed to be
   the art of arts [2578] and science of sciences.  Any one may recognize
   this, by comparing the work of the physician of souls with the
   treatment of the body; and noticing that, laborious as the latter is,
   ours is more laborious, and of more consequence, from the nature of its
   subject matter, the power of its science, and the object of its
   exercise.  The one labours about bodies, and perishable failing matter,
   which absolutely must be dissolved and undergo its fate, [2579] even if
   upon this occasion by the aid of art it can surmount the disturbance
   within itself, being dissolved by disease or time in submission to the
   law of nature, since it cannot rise above its own limitations.

   17.  The other is concerned with the soul, which comes from God and is
   divine, and partakes of the heavenly nobility, and presses on to it,
   even if it be bound to an inferior nature.  Perhaps indeed there are
   other reasons also for this, which only God, Who bound them together,
   and those who are instructed by God in such mysteries, can know, but as
   far as I, and men like myself can perceive, there are two:  one, that
   it may inherit the glory above by means of a struggle and wrestling
   [2580] with things below, being tried as gold in the fire [2581] by
   things here, and gain the objects of our hope as a prize of virtue, and
   not merely as the gift of God.  This, indeed, was the will of Supreme
   Goodness, to make the good even our own, not only because sown in our
   nature, but because cultivated by our own choice, and by the motions of
   our will, [2582] free to act in either direction.  The second reason
   is, that it may draw to itself and raise to heaven the lower nature, by
   gradually freeing it from its grossness, in order that the soul may be
   to the body what God is to the soul, itself leading on the matter which
   ministers to it, and uniting it, as its fellow-servant, to God.

   18.  Place and time and age and season and the like are the subjects of
   a physician's scrutiny; he will prescribe medicines and diet, and guard
   against things injurious, that the desires of the sick may not be a
   hindrance to his art.  Sometimes, and in certain cases, he will make
   use of the cautery or the knife or the severer remedies; but none of
   these, laborious and hard as they may seem, is so difficult as the
   diagnosis and cure of our habits, passions, lives, wills, and whatever
   else is within us, by banishing from our compound nature everything
   brutal and fierce, and introducing and establishing in their stead what
   is gentle and dear to God, and arbitrating fairly between soul and
   body; not allowing the superior to be overpowered by the inferior,
   which would be the greatest injustice; but subjecting to the ruling and
   leading power that which naturally takes the second place:  as indeed
   the divine law enjoins, which is most excellently imposed on His whole
   creation, whether visible or beyond our ken.

   19.  This further point does not escape me, that the nature of all
   these objects of the watchfulness of the physician remains the same,
   and does not evolve out of itself any crafty opposition, or contrivance
   hostile to the appliances of his art, nay, it is rather the treatment
   which modifies its subject matter, [2583] except where some slight
   insubordination occurs on the part of the patient, which it is not
   difficult to prevent or restrain.  But in our case, human prudence and
   selfishness, and the want of training and inclination to yield ready
   submission are a very great obstacle to advance in virtue, amounting
   almost to an armed resistance to those who are wishful to help us.  And
   the very eagerness with which we should lay bare our sickness to our
   spiritual physicians, we employ in avoiding this treatment, [2584] and
   shew our bravery by struggling against what is for our own interest,
   our skill in shunning what is for our health.

   20.  For we either hide away our sin, cloaking it over in the depth of
   our soul, like some festering and malignant disease, as if by escaping
   the notice of men we could escape the mighty eye of God and justice.
   Or else we allege excuses in our sins, [2585] by devising pleas in
   defence of our falls, or tightly closing our ears, like the deaf adder
   that stoppeth her ears, we are obstinate in refusing to hear the voice
   of the charmer, and be treated with the medicines of wisdom, [2586] by
   which spiritual sickness is healed.  Or, lastly, those of us who are
   most daring and self-willed shamelessly brazen out our sin before those
   who would heal it, marching with bared head, as the saying is, into all
   kinds of transgression.  O what madness, if there be no term more
   fitting for this state of mind!  Those whom we ought to love as our
   benefactors we keep off, as if they were our enemies, hating those who
   reprove in the gates, and abhorring the righteous word; [2587] and we
   think that we shall succeed in the war that we are waging against those
   who are well disposed to us by doing ourselves all the harm we can,
   like men who imagine they are consuming the flesh of others when they
   are really fastening upon their own.

   21.  For these reasons I allege that our office as physicians far
   exceeds in toilsomeness, and consequently in worth, that which is
   confined to the body; and further, because the latter is mainly
   concerned with the surface, and only in a slight degree investigates
   the causes which are deeply hidden.  But the whole of our treatment and
   exertion is concerned with the hidden man of the heart, [2588] and our
   warfare is directed against that adversary and foe within us, who uses
   ourselves as his weapons against ourselves, and, most fearful of all,
   hands us over to the death of sin.  In opposition then, to these foes
   we are in need of great and perfect faith, and of still greater
   co-operation on the part of God, and, as I am persuaded, of no slight
   countermanoeuvring on our own part, which must manifest itself both in
   word and deed, if ourselves, the most precious possession we have, are
   to be duly tended and cleansed and made as deserving as possible.

   22.  To turn however to the ends in view in each of these forms of
   healing, for this point is still left to be considered, the one
   preserves, if it already exists, the health and good habit of the
   flesh, or if absent, recalls it; though it is not yet clear whether or
   not these will be for the advantage of those who possess them, since
   their opposites very often confer a greater benefit on those who have
   them, just as poverty and wealth, renown or disgrace, a low or
   brilliant position, and all other circumstances, which are naturally
   indifferent, and do not incline in one direction more than in another,
   produce a good or bad effect according to the will of, and the manner
   in which they are used by the persons who experience them.  But the
   scope of our art is to provide the soul with wings, to rescue it from
   the world and give it to God, and to watch over that which is in His
   image, [2589] if it abides, to take it by the hand, if it is in danger,
   or restore it, if ruined, to make Christ to dwell in the heart [2590]
   by the Spirit:  and, in short, to deify, and bestow heavenly bliss
   upon, one who belongs to the heavenly host.

   23.  This is the wish of our schoolmaster [2591] the law, of the
   prophets who intervened between Christ and the law, of Christ who is
   the fulfiller and end [2592] of the spiritual law; of the emptied
   Godhead, [2593] of the assumed flesh, [2594] of the novel union between
   God and man, one consisting [2595] of two, and both in one.  This is
   why God was united [2596] to the flesh by means of the soul, [2597] and
   natures so separate were knit together by the affinity to each of the
   element which mediated between them:  so all became one for the sake of
   all, and for the sake of one, our progenitor, the soul because of the
   soul which was disobedient, the flesh because of the flesh which
   co-operated with it and shared in its condemnation, Christ, Who was
   superior to, and beyond the reach of, sin, because of Adam, who became
   subject to sin.

   24.  This is why the new was substituted for the old, [2598] why He Who
   suffered was for suffering recalled to life, why each property of His,
   Who was above us, was interchanged with each of ours, why the new
   mystery took place of the dispensation, due to loving kindness which
   deals with him who fell through disobedience.  This is the reason for
   the generation and the virgin, for the manger and Bethlehem; the
   generation on behalf of the creation, [2599] the virgin on behalf of
   the woman, [2600] Bethlehem [2601] because of Eden, the manger because
   of the garden, small and visible things on behalf of great and hidden
   things.  This is why the angels [2602] glorified first the heavenly,
   then the earthly, [2603] why the shepherds saw the glory over the Lamb
   and the Shepherd, why the star led the Magi to worship and offer gifts,
   [2604] in order that idolatry might be destroyed.  This is why Jesus
   was baptized, [2605] and received testimony from above, and fasted,
   [2606] and was tempted, and overcame him who had overcome.  This is why
   devils were cast out, [2607] and diseases healed, and the mighty
   preaching was entrusted to, and successfully proclaimed by men of low
   estate.

   25.  This is why the heathen rage and the peoples imagine vain things;
   [2608] why tree [2609] is set over against tree, [2610] hands against
   hand, the one stretched out in self indulgence, [2611] the others in
   generosity; the one unrestrained, the others fixed by nails, [2612] the
   one expelling Adam, the other reconciling the ends of the earth.  This
   is the reason of the lifting up to atone for the fall, and of the gall
   for the tasting, and of the thorny crown for the dominion of evil, and
   of death for death, and of darkness for the sake of light, and of
   burial for the return to the ground, and of resurrection for the sake
   of resurrection. [2613]   All these are a training from God for us, and
   a healing for our weakness, restoring the old Adam to the place whence
   he fell, and conducting us to the tree of life, [2614] from which the
   tree of knowledge estranged us, when partaken of unseasonably, and
   improperly.

   26.  Of this healing we, who are set over others, are the ministers and
   fellow-labourers; [2615] for whom it is a great thing to recognise and
   heal their own passions and sicknesses:  or rather, not really a great
   thing, only the viciousness of most of those who belong to this order
   has made me say so:  but a much greater thing is the power to heal and
   skilfully cleanse those of others, to the advantage both of those who
   are in want of healing and of those whose charge it is to heal.

   27.  Again, the healers of our bodies will have their labours and
   vigils and cares, of which we are aware; and will reap a harvest of
   pain for themselves from the distresses of others, as one of their wise
   men [2616] said; and will provide for the use of those who need them,
   both the results of their own labours and investigations, and what they
   have been able to borrow from others:  and they consider none, even of
   the minutest details, which they discover, or which elude their search,
   as having other than an important influence upon health or danger.  And
   what is the object of all this?  That a man may live some days longer
   on the earth, though he is possibly not a good man, but one of the most
   depraved, for whom it had perhaps been better, because of his badness,
   to have died long ago, in order to be set free from vice, the most
   serious of sicknesses.  But, suppose he is a good man, how long will he
   be able to live?  Forever?  Or what will he gain from life here, from
   which it is the greatest of blessings, if a man be sane and sensible,
   to seek to be set free?

   28.  But we, upon whose efforts is staked the salvation of a soul, a
   being blessed and immortal, and destined for undying chastisement or
   praise, for its vice or virtue,--what a struggle ought ours to be, and
   how great skill do we require to treat, or get men treated properly,
   and to change their life, and give up the clay to the spirit.  For men
   and women, young and old, rich and poor, the sanguine and despondent,
   the sick and whole, rulers and ruled, the wise and ignorant, the
   cowardly and courageous, the wrathful and meek, the successful and
   failing, do not require the same instruction and encouragement.

   29.  And if you examine more closely, how great is the distinction
   between the married and the unmarried, and among the latter between
   hermits and those who [2617] live together in community, between those
   who are proficient and advanced in contemplation and those who barely
   hold on the straight course, between townsfolk again and rustics,
   between the simple and the designing, between men of business and men
   of leisure, between those who have met with reverses and those who are
   prosperous and ignorant of misfortune.  For these classes differ
   sometimes more widely from each other in their desires and passion than
   in their physical characteristics; or, if you will, in the mixtures and
   blendings of the elements of which we are composed, and, therefore, to
   regulate them is no easy task.

   30.  As then the same medicine and the same food are not in every case
   administered to men's bodies, but a difference is made according to
   their degree of health or infirmity; so also are souls treated with
   varying instruction and guidance.  To this treatment witness is borne
   by those who have had experience of it.  Some are led by doctrine,
   others trained by example; some need the spur, others the curb; some
   are sluggish and hard to rouse to the good, and must be stirred up by
   being smitten with the word; others are immoderately fervent in spirit,
   with impulses difficult to restrain, like thoroughbred colts, who run
   wide of the turning post, and to improve them the word must have a
   restraining and checking influence.

   31.  Some are benefited by praise, others by blame, both being applied
   in season; while if out of season, or unreasonable, they are injurious;
   some are set right by encouragement, others by rebuke; some, when taken
   to task in public, others, when privately corrected.  For some are wont
   to despise private admonitions, but are recalled to their senses by the
   condemnation of a number of people, while others, who would grow
   reckless under reproof openly given, accept rebuke because it is in
   secret, and yield obedience in return for sympathy.

   32.  Upon some it is needful to keep a close watch, even in the
   minutest details, because if they think they are unperceived (as they
   would contrive to be), they are puffed up with the idea of their own
   wisdom.  Of others it is better to take no notice, but seeing not to
   see, and hearing not to hear them, according to the proverb, that we
   may not drive them to despair, under the depressing influence of
   repeated reproofs, and at last to utter recklessness, when they have
   lost the sense of self-respect, the source of persuasiveness. [2618]
   In some cases we must even be angry, without feeling angry, or treat
   them with a disdain we do not feel, or manifest despair, though we do
   not really despair of them, according to the needs of their nature.
   Others again we must treat with condescension [2619] and lowliness,
   aiding them readily to conceive a hope of better things.  Some it is
   often more advantageous to conquer--by others to be overcome, and to
   praise or deprecate, in one case wealth and power, in another poverty
   and failure.

   33.  For our treatment does not correspond with virtue and vice, one of
   which is most excellent and beneficial at all times and in all cases,
   and the other most evil and harmful; and, instead of one and the same
   of our medicines invariably proving either most wholesome or most
   dangerous in the same cases--be it severity or gentleness, or any of
   the others which we have enumerated--in some cases it proves good and
   useful, in others again it has the contrary effect, according, I
   suppose, as time and circumstance and the disposition of the patient
   admit.  Now to set before you the distinction between all these things,
   and give you a perfectly exact view of them, so that you may in brief
   comprehend the medical art, is quite impossible, even for one in the
   highest degree qualified by care and skill:  but actual experience and
   practice are requisite to form [2620] a medical system and a medical
   man.

   34.  This, however, I take to be generally admitted--that just as it is
   not safe for those who walk on a lofty tight rope to lean to either
   side, for even though the inclination seems slight, it has no slight
   consequences, but their safety depends upon their perfect balance:  so
   in the case of one of us, if he leans to either side, whether from vice
   or ignorance, no slight danger of a fall into sin is incurred, both for
   himself and those who are led by him.  But we must really walk in the
   King's highway, [2621] and take care not to turn aside from it either
   to the right hand or to the left, [2622] as the Proverbs say.  For such
   is the case with our passions, and such in this matter is the task of
   the good shepherd, if he is to know properly the souls of his flock,
   and to guide them according to the methods of a pastoral care which is
   right and just, and worthy of our true Shepherd.

   35.  In regard to the distribution of the word, to mention last the
   first of our duties, of that divine and exalted word, which everyone
   now is ready to discourse upon; if anyone else boldly undertakes it and
   supposes it within the power of every man's intellect, I am amazed at
   his intelligence, not to say his folly.  To me indeed it seems no
   slight task, and one requiring no little spiritual power, to give in
   due season [2623] to each his portion of the word, and to regulate with
   judgment the truth of our opinions, which are concerned with such
   subjects as the world or worlds, [2624] matter, soul, mind, intelligent
   natures, better or worse, providence which holds together and guides
   the universe, and seems in our experience of it to be governed
   according to some principle, but one which is at variance with those of
   earth and of men.

   36.  Again, they are concerned with our original constitution, and
   final restoration, the types of the truth, the covenants, the first and
   second coming of Christ, His incarnation, sufferings and dissolution,
   [2625] with the resurrection, the last day, the judgment and
   recompense, whether sad or glorious; I, to crown all, with what we are
   to think of the original [2626] and blessed Trinity.  Now this involves
   a very great risk to those who are charged with the illumination [2627]
   of others, if they are to avoid contracting [2628] their doctrine to a
   single Person, from fear of polytheism, and so leave us empty terms, if
   we suppose the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit to be one and the
   same Person only:  or, on the other hand, severing It into three,
   either foreign and diverse, or disordered and unprincipled, and, so to
   say, opposed divinities, thus falling from the opposite side into an
   equally dangerous error:  like some distorted plant if bent far back in
   the opposite direction.

   37.  For, amid the three infirmities in regard to theology, atheism,
   Judaism, and polytheism, one of which is patronised by Sabellius the
   Libyan, another by Arius of Alexandria, and the third by some of the
   ultra-orthodox among us, what is my position, can I avoid whatever in
   these three is noxious, and remain within the limits of piety; neither
   being led astray by the new analysis and synthesis into the atheism
   [2629] of Sabellius, to assert not so much that all are one as that
   each is nothing, for things which are transferred and pass into each
   other cease to be that which each one of them is, of that we have an
   unnaturally compound deity, like those mythical creatures, the subject
   of a picturesque imagination:  nor again, by alleging a plurality of
   severed natures, according to the well named madness [2630] of Arius,
   becoming involved in a Jewish poverty, and introducing envy into the
   divine nature, by limiting the Godhead to the Unbegotten One alone, as
   if afraid that our God would perish, if He were the Father of a real
   God of equal nature:  nor again, by arraying three principles in
   opposition to, or in alliance with, each other, introducing the Gentile
   plurality of principles from which we have escaped?

   38.  It is necessary neither to be so devoted to the Father, as to rob
   Him of His Fatherhood, for whose Father would He be, if the Son were
   separated and estranged from Him, by being ranked with the creation,
   (for an alien being, or one which is combined and confounded with his
   father, and, for the sense is the same, throws him into confusion, is
   not a son); nor to be so devoted to Christ, as to neglect to preserve
   both His Sonship, (for whose son would He be, if His origin were not
   referred to the Father?) and the rank of the Father as origin, inasmuch
   as He is the Father and Generator; for He would be the origin of petty
   and unworthy beings, or rather the term would be used in a petty and
   unworthy sense, if He were not the origin of Godhead and goodness,
   which are contemplated in the Son and the Spirit:  the former being the
   Son and the Word, the latter the proceeding and indissoluble Spirit.
   For both the Unity of the Godhead must be preserved, and the Trinity of
   Persons confessed, each with His own property.

   39.  A suitable and worthy comprehension and exposition of this subject
   demands a discussion of greater length than the present occasion, or
   even our life, as I suppose, allows, and, what is more, both now and at
   all times, the aid of the Spirit, by Whom alone we are able to
   perceive, to expound, or to embrace, the truth in regard to God.  For
   the pure alone can grasp Him Who is pure and of the same disposition as
   himself; and I have now briefly dwelt upon the subject, to show how
   difficult it is to discuss such important questions, especially before
   a large audience, composed of every age and condition, and needing like
   an instrument of many strings, to be played upon in various ways; or to
   find any form of words able to edify them all, and illuminate them with
   the light of knowledge.  For it is not only that there are three
   sources from which danger springs, understanding, speech, and hearing,
   so that failure in one, if not in all, is infallibly certain; for
   either the mind is not illuminated, or the language is feeble, or the
   hearing, not having been cleansed, fails to comprehend, and
   accordingly, in one or all respects, the truth must be maimed:  but
   further, what makes the instruction of those who profess to teach any
   other subject so easy and acceptable--viz. the piety [2631] of the
   audience--on this subject involves difficulty and danger.

   40.  For having undertaken to contend on behalf of God, the Supreme
   Being, and of salvation, and of the primary hope [2632] of us all, the
   more fervent they are in the faith, the more hostile are they to what
   is said, supposing that a submissive spirit indicates, not piety, but
   treason to the truth, and therefore they would sacrifice anything
   rather than their private convictions, and the accustomed doctrines in
   which they have been educated.  I am now referring to those who are
   moderate and not utterly depraved in disposition, who, if they have
   erred in regard to the truth, have erred from piety, who have zeal,
   though not according to knowledge, [2633] who will possibly be of the
   number of those not excessively condemned, and not beaten with many
   stripes, [2634] because it is not through vice or depravity that they
   have failed to do the will of their Lord; and these perchance would be
   persuaded and forsake the pious opinion which is the cause of their
   hostility, if some reason either from their own minds, or from others,
   were to take hold of them, and at a critical moment, like iron from
   flint, strike fire from a mind which is pregnant and worthy of the
   light, for thus a little spark would quickly kindle the torch of truth
   within it.

   41.  But what is to be said of those who, from vain glory or arrogance,
   speak unrighteousness against the most High, [2635] arming themselves
   with the insolence of Jannes and Jambres, [2636] not against Moses, but
   against the truth, and rising in opposition to sound doctrine?  Or of
   the third class, who through ignorance and, its consequence, temerity,
   rush headlong against every form of doctrine in swinish fashion, and
   trample under foot the fair pearls [2637] of the truth?

   42.  What again of those who come with no private idea, or form of
   words, better or worse, in regard to God, but listen to all kinds of
   doctrines and teachers, with the intention of selecting from all what
   is best and safest, in reliance upon no better judges of the truth than
   themselves?  They are, in consequence, borne and turned about hither
   and thither by one plausible idea after another, and, after being
   deluged and trodden down by all kinds of doctrine, [2638] and having
   rung the changes on a long succession of teachers and formulæ, which
   they throw to the winds as readily as dust, their ears and minds at
   last are wearied out, and, O what folly! they become equally disgusted
   with all forms of doctrine, and assume the wretched character of
   deriding and despising our faith as unstable and unsound; passing in
   their ignorance from the teachers to the doctrine:  as if anyone whose
   eyes were diseased, or whose ears had been injured, were to complain of
   the sun for being dim and not shining, or of sounds for being
   inharmonious and feeble.

   43.  Accordingly, to impress the truth upon a soul when it is still
   fresh, like wax not yet subjected to the seal, is an easier task than
   inscribing pious doctrine on the top of inscriptions--I mean wrong
   doctrines and dogmas [2639] --with the result that the former are
   confused and thrown into disorder by the latter.  It is better indeed
   to tread a road which is smooth and well trodden than one which is
   untrodden and rough, or to plough land which has often been cleft and
   broken up by the plough:  but a soul to be written upon should be free
   from the inscription of harmful doctrines, or the deeply cut marks of
   vice:  otherwise the pious inscriber would have a twofold task, the
   erasure of the former impressions and the substitution of others which
   are more excellent, and more worthy to abide.  So numerous are they
   whose wickedness is shown, not only by yielding to their passions, but
   even by their utterances, and so numerous the forms and characters of
   wickedness, and so considerable the task of one who has been intrusted
   with this office of educating and taking charge of souls.  Indeed I
   have omitted the majority of the details, lest my speech should be
   unnecessarily burdensome.

   44.  If anyone were to undertake to tame and train an animal of many
   forms and shapes, compounded of many animals of various sizes and
   degrees of tameness and wildness, his principal task, involving a
   considerable struggle, would be the government of so extraordinary and
   heterogeneous a nature, since each of the animals of which it is
   compounded would, according to its nature or habit, be differently
   affected with joy, pleasure or dislike, by the same words, or food, or
   stroking with the hand, or whistling, or other modes of treatment.  And
   what must the master of such an animal do, but show himself manifold
   and various in his knowledge, and apply to each a treatment suitable
   for it, so as successfully to lead and preserve the beast?  And since
   the common body of the church is composed of many different characters
   and minds, like a single animal compounded of discordant parts, it is
   absolutely necessary that its ruler should be at once simple in his
   uprightness in all respects, and as far as possible manifold and varied
   in his treatment of individuals, and in dealing with all in an
   appropriate and suitable manner.

   45.  For some need to be fed with the milk [2640] of the most simple
   and elementary doctrines, viz., those who are in habit babes and, so to
   say, new-made, and unable to bear the manly food of the word:  nay, if
   it were presented to them beyond their strength, they would probably be
   overwhelmed and oppressed, owing to the inability of their mind, as is
   the case with our material bodies, [2641] to digest and appropriate
   what is offered to it, and so would lose even their original power.
   Others require the wisdom which is spoken among the perfect, [2642] and
   the higher and more solid food, since their senses have been
   sufficiently exercised to discern [2643] truth and falsehood, and if
   they were made to drink milk, and fed on the vegetable diet of
   invalids, [2644] they would be annoyed.  And with good reason, for they
   would not be strengthened [2645] according to Christ, nor make that
   laudable increase, which the Word produces in one who is rightly fed,
   by making him a perfect man, and bringing him to the measure of
   spiritual stature. [2646]

   46.  And who is sufficient for these things?  For we are not as the
   many, able to corrupt [2647] the word of truth, and mix the wine,
   [2648] which maketh glad the heart of man, [2649] with water, mix, that
   is, our doctrine with what is common and cheap, and debased, and stale,
   and tasteless, in order to turn the adulteration to our profit, and
   accommodate ourselves to those who meet us, and curry favor with
   everyone, becoming ventriloquists [2650] and chatterers, who serve
   their own pleasures by words uttered from the earth, and sinking into
   the earth, and, to gain the special good will of the multitude,
   injuring in the highest degree, nay, ruining ourselves, and shedding
   the innocent blood of simpler souls, which will be required at our
   hands. [2651]

   47.  Besides, we are aware that it is better to offer our own reins to
   others more skilful than ourselves, than, while inexperienced, to guide
   the course of others, and rather to give a kindly hearing than stir an
   untrained tongue; and after a discussion of these points with advisers
   who are, I fancy, of no mean worth, and, at any rate, wish us well, we
   preferred to learn those canons of speech and action which we did not
   know, rather than undertake to teach them in our ignorance.  For it is
   delightful to have the reasoning [2652] of the aged come to one even
   until the depth of old age, able, as it is, to aid a soul new to
   piety.  Accordingly, to undertake the training of others before being
   sufficiently trained oneself, and to learn, as men say, the potter's
   art on a wine-jar, that is, to practise ourselves in piety at the
   expense of others' souls seems to me to be excessive folly or excessive
   rashness--folly, if we are not even aware of our own ignorance;
   rashness, if in spite of this knowledge we venture on the task.

   48.  Nay, the wiser of the Hebrews tell us that there was of old among
   the Hebrews a most excellent and praiseworthy law, [2653] that every
   age was not entrusted with the whole of Scripture, inasmuch as this
   would not be the more profitable course, since the whole of it is not
   at once intelligible to everyone, and its more recondite parts would,
   by their apparent meaning, do a very great injury to most people.  Some
   portions therefore, whose exterior [2654] is unexceptionable, are from
   the first permitted and common to all; while others are only entrusted
   to those who have attained their twenty-fifth year, viz., such as hide
   their mystical beauty under a mean-looking cloak, to be the reward of
   diligence and an illustrious life; flashing forth and presenting itself
   only to those whose mind has been purified, on the ground that this age
   alone [2655] can be superior to the body, and properly rise from the
   letter to the spirit.

   49.  Among us, however, there is no boundary line between giving and
   receiving instruction, like the stones of old between the tribes within
   and beyond the Jordan:  nor is a certain part entrusted to some,
   another to others; nor any rule for degrees [2656] of experience; but
   the matter has been so disturbed and thrown into confusion, that most
   of us, not to say all, almost before we have lost our childish curls
   and lisp, before we have entered the house of God, before we know even
   the names of the Sacred Books, before we have learnt the character and
   authors of the Old and New Testaments:  (for my present point is not
   our want of cleansing from the mire and marks of spiritual shame which
   our viciousness has contracted) if, I say, we have furnished ourselves
   with two or three expressions of pious authors, and that by hearsay,
   not by study; if we have had a brief experience of David, or clad
   ourselves properly in a cloaklet, or are wearing at least a
   philosopher's girdle, or have girt about us some form and appearance of
   piety--phew! how we take the chair and show our spirit!  Samuel was
   holy even in his swaddling-clothes: [2657]   we are at once wise
   teachers, of high estimation in Divine things, the first of scribes and
   lawyers; we ordain ourselves men of heaven and seek to be called Rabbi
   by men; [2658] the letter is nowhere, everything is to be understood
   spiritually, and our dreams are utter drivel, and we should be annoyed
   if we were not lauded to excess.  This is the case with the better and
   more simple of us:  what of those who are more spiritual and noble?
   [2659]   After frequently condemning us, as men of no account, they
   have forsaken us, and abhor fellowship with impious people such as we
   are.

   50.  Now, if we were to speak gently to one of them, advancing, as
   follows, step by step in argument:  "Tell me, my good sir, do you call
   dancing anything, and flute-playing?" "Certainly," they would say.
   "What then of wisdom and being wise, which we venture to define as a
   knowledge of things divine and human?"  This also they will admit.
   "Are then these accomplishments better than and superior to wisdom, or
   wisdom by far better than these?"  "Better even than all things," I
   know well that they will say.  Up to this point they are judicious.
   "Well, dancing and flute-playing require to be taught and learnt, a
   process which takes time, and much toil in the sweat of the brow, and
   sometimes the payment of fees, and entreaties for initiation, and long
   absence from home, and all else which must be done and borne for the
   acquisition of experience:  but as for wisdom, which is chief of all
   things, and holds in her embrace everything which is good, so that even
   God himself prefers this title to all the names which He is called; are
   we to suppose that it is a matter of such slight consequence, and so
   accessible, that we need but wish, and we would be wise?"  "It would be
   utter folly to do so."  If we, or any learned and prudent man, were to
   say this to them, and try by degrees to cleanse them from their error,
   it would be sowing upon rocks, [2660] and speaking to ears of men who
   will not hear: [2661]   so far are they from being even wise enough to
   perceive their own ignorance.  And we may rightly, in my opinion, apply
   to them the saying of Solomon:  There is an evil which I have seen
   under the sun, [2662] a man wise in his own conceit; [2663] and a still
   greater evil is to charge with the instruction of others a man who is
   not even aware of his own ignorance.

   51.  This is a state of mind which demands, in special degree, our
   tears and groans, and has often stirred my pity, from the conviction
   that imagination robs us in great measure of reality, and that vain
   glory is a great hindrance to men's attainment of virtue.  To heal and
   stay this disease needs a Peter or Paul, those great disciples of
   Christ, who in addition to guidance in word and deed, received their
   grace, [2664] and became all things to all men, that they might gain
   all. [2665]   But for other men like ourselves, it is a great thing to
   be rightly guided and led by those who have been charged with the
   correction and setting right of things such as these.

   52.  Since, however, I have mentioned Paul, and men like him, I will,
   with your permission, pass by all others who have been foremost as
   lawgivers, prophets, or leaders, or in any similar office--for
   instance, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Elijah, Elisha, the Judges, Samuel,
   David, the company of Prophets, John, the Twelve Apostles, and their
   successors, who with many toils and labors exercised their authority,
   each in his own time; all these I pass by, to set forth Paul as the
   witness to my assertions, and for us to consider by his example how
   important a matter is the care of souls, and whether it requires slight
   attention and little judgment.  But that we may recognize and perceive
   this, let us hear what Paul himself says of Paul.

   53.  I say nothing of his labours, his watchings, his sufferings in
   hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness, his assailants from without,
   his adversaries within. [2666]   I pass over the persecutions,
   councils, prisons, bonds, accusers, tribunals, the daily and hourly
   deaths, the basket, the stonings, beatings with rods, the travelling
   about, the perils by land and sea, the deep, the shipwrecks, the perils
   of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from his countrymen, perils among
   false brethren, the living by his own hands, the gospel without charge,
   [2667] the being a spectacle to both angels and men, [2668] set in the
   midst between God and men to champion His cause, [2669] and to unite
   them to Him, and make them His own peculiar people, [2670] beside those
   things that are without. [2671]   For who could worthily detail these
   matters, the daily pressure, [2672] the individual solicitude, the care
   of all the churches, the universal sympathy, and brotherly love?  Did
   anyone stumble, Paul also was weak; did another suffer scandal, it was
   Paul who was on fire.

   54.  What of the laboriousness of his teaching?  The manifold character
   of his ministry?  His loving kindness?  And on the other hand his
   strictness?  And the combination and blending of the two; in such wise
   that his gentleness should not enervate, nor his severity exasperate?
   He gives laws for slaves and masters, [2673] rulers and ruled, [2674]
   husbands and wives, [2675] parents and children, [2676] marriage and
   celibacy, [2677] self-discipline and indulgence, [2678] wisdom and
   ignorance, [2679] circumcision and uncircumcision, [2680] Christ and
   the world, the flesh and the spirit. [2681]   On behalf of some he
   gives thanks, others he upbraids.  Some he names his joy and crown,
   [2682] others he charges with folly. [2683]   Some who hold a straight
   course he accompanies, sharing in their zeal; others he checks, who are
   going wrong.  At one time he excommunicates, [2684] at another he
   confirms his love; [2685] at one time he grieves, at another rejoices;
   at one time he feeds with milk, at another he handles mysteries; [2686]
   at one time he condescends, at another he raises to his own level; at
   one time he threatens a rod, [2687] at another he offers the spirit of
   meekness; at one time he is haughty toward the lofty, at another lowly
   toward the lowly.  Now he is least of the apostles, [2688] now he
   offers a proof of Christ speaking in him; [2689] now he longs for
   departure and is being poured forth as a libation, [2690] now he thinks
   it more necessary for their sakes to abide in the flesh.  For he seeks
   not his own interests, but those of his children, [2691] whom he has
   begotten in Christ by the gospel. [2692]   This is the aim of all his
   spiritual authority, in everything to neglect his own in comparison
   with the advantage of others.

   55.  He glories in his infirmities and distresses.  He takes pleasure
   in the dying of Jesus, [2693] as if it were a kind of ornament.  He is
   lofty in carnal things, [2694] he rejoices in things spiritual; he is
   not rude in knowledge, [2695] and claims to see in a mirror, darkly.
   [2696]   He is bold in spirit, and buffets his body, [2697] throwing it
   as an antagonist.  What is the lesson and instruction he would thus
   impress upon us?  Not to be proud of earthly things, or puffed up by
   knowledge, or excite the flesh against the spirit.  He fights for all,
   prays for all, is jealous for all, is kindled on behalf of all, whether
   without law, or under the law; a preacher of the Gentiles, [2698] a
   patron of the Jews.  He even was exceedingly bold on behalf of his
   brethren according to the flesh, [2699] if I may myself be bold enough
   to say so, in his loving prayer that they might in his stead be brought
   to Christ.  What magnanimity! what fervor of spirit!  He imitates
   Christ, who became a curse for us, [2700] who took our infirmities and
   bore our sicknesses; [2701] or, to use more measured terms, he is
   ready, next to Christ, to suffer anything, even as one of the ungodly,
   for them, if only they be saved.

   56.  Why should I enter into detail?  He lived not to himself, but to
   Christ and his preaching.  He crucified the world to himself, [2702]
   and being crucified to the world and the things which are seen, he
   thought all things little, [2703] and too small to be desired; even
   though from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum [2704] he had
   fully preached the Gospel, even though he had been prematurely caught
   up to the third heaven, and had a vision of Paradise, and had heard
   unspeakable words. [2705]   Such was Paul, and everyone of like spirit
   with him.  But we fear that, in comparison with them, we may be foolish
   princes of Zoan, [2706] or extortioners, who exact the fruits of the
   ground, or falsely bless the people: [2707]   and further make
   themselves happy, and confuse the way of your feet, [2708] or mockers
   ruling over you, or children in authority, [2709] immature in mind, not
   even having bread and clothing enough to be rulers over any; [2710] or
   prophets teaching lies, [2711] or rebellious princes, [2712] deserving
   to share the reproach of their elders for the straitness of the famine,
   [2713] or priests very far from speaking comfortably [2714] to
   Jerusalem, according to the reproaches and protests urged by Isaiah,
   who was purged by the Seraphim with a live coal. [2715]

   57.  Is the undertaking then so serious and laborious to a sensitive
   and sad heart--a very rottenness to the bones [2716] of a sensible
   man:  while the danger is slight, and a fall not worth consideration?
   Nay the blessed Hosea inspires me with serious alarm, where he says
   that to us priests and rulers pertaineth the judgment, [2717] because
   we have been a snare to the watchtower; and as a net spread upon Tabor,
   which has been firmly fixed by the hunters of men's souls, and he
   threatens to cut off the wicked prophets, [2718] and devour their
   judges with fire, and to cease for a while from anointing a king and
   princes, [2719] because they ruled for themselves, and not by Him.
   [2720]

   58.  Hence again the divine Micah, unable to brook the building of Zion
   with blood, however you interpret the phrase, and of Jerusalem with
   iniquity, while the heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests
   teach for hire, and the prophets divine for money--what does he say
   will be the result of this?  Zion shall be plowed as a field, and
   Jerusalem be as a lodge in a garden, and the mountain of the house be
   reckoned as a glade in a thicket. [2721]   He bewails also the scarcity
   of the upright, there being scarcely a stalk or a gleaning grape left,
   since both the prince asketh, and the judge curries favour, [2722] so
   that his language is almost the same as the mighty David's:  Save me, O
   Lord, for the godly man ceaseth: [2723]   and says that therefore their
   blessings shall fail them, as if wasted by the moth.

   59.  Joel again summons us to wailing, and will have the ministers of
   the altar lament under the presence of famine:  so far is he from
   allowing us to revel in the misfortunes of others:  and, after
   sanctifying a fast, calling a solemn assembly, and gathering the old
   men, the children, and those of tender age, [2724] we ourselves must
   further haunt the temple in sackcloth and ashes, [2725] prostrated
   right humbly on the ground, because the field is wasted, and the
   meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of the
   Lord, till we draw down mercy by our humiliation.

   60.  What of Habakkuk?  He utters more heated words, and is impatient
   with God Himself, and cries down, as it were our good Lord, because of
   the injustice of the judges.  O Lord, how long shall I cry and Thou
   wilt not hear?  Shall I cry out unto Thee of violence, and Thou wilt
   not save?  Why dost Thou show me toil and labour, causing me to look
   upon perverseness and impiety?  Judgment has been given against me, and
   the judge is a spoiler.  Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment
   doth never go forth.  Then comes the denunciation, and what follows
   upon it.  Behold, ye despisers, and regard, and wonder marvellously,
   and vanish away, for I work a work. [2726]   But why need I quote the
   whole of the denunciation?  A little further on, however, for I think
   it best to add this to what has been said, after upbraiding and
   lamenting many of those who are in some respect unjust or depraved, he
   upbraids the leaders and teachers of wickedness, stigmatising vice as a
   foul disorder, and an intoxication and aberration of mind; charging
   them with giving their neighbours drink in order to look upon the
   darkness of their soul, [2727] and the dens of creeping things and wild
   beasts, viz.:  the dwelling places of wicked thoughts.  Such indeed
   they are, and such teachings do they discuss with us.

   61.  How can it be right to pass by Malachi, who at one time brings
   bitter charges against the priests, and reproaches them with despising
   the name of the Lord, [2728] and explains wherein they did this, by
   offering polluted bread upon the altar, and meat which is not
   firstfruits, which they would not have offered to one of their
   governors, or, if they had offered it, they would have been
   dishonoured; yet offering these in fulfilment of a vow to the King of
   the universe, to wit, the lame and the sick, and the deformed, which
   are utterly profane and loathsome. [2729]   Again he reminds them of
   the covenant of God, a covenant of life and peace, with the sons of
   Levi, and that they should serve Him in fear, and stand in awe of the
   manifestation of His Name.  The law of truth, he says, was in his
   mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with me
   uprightly in peace, and turned away many from iniquity:  for the
   priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his
   mouth.  And how honourable and at the same time how fearful is the
   cause! for he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty. [2730]   Although
   I pass over the following imprecations, as strongly worded, [2731] yet
   I am afraid of their truth.  This however may be cited without offence,
   to our profit.  Is it right, he says, to regard your sacrifice, and
   receive it with good will at your hands, [2732] as if he were most
   highly incensed, and rejecting their ministrations owing to their
   wickedness.

   62.  Whenever I remember Zechariah, I shudder at the reaping-hook,
   [2733] and likewise at his testimony against the priests, his hints in
   reference to the celebrated Joshua, the high priest, whom he represents
   as stripped of filthy and unbecoming garments and then clothed in rich
   priestly apparel. [2734]   As for the words and charges to Joshua which
   he puts into the angel's mouth, let them be treated with silent
   respect, as referring perhaps to a greater [2735] and higher object
   than those who are many priests: [2736]   but even at his right hand
   stood the devil, to resist him.  A fact, in my eyes, of no slight
   significance, and demanding no slight fear and watchfulness.

   63.  Who is so bold and adamantine of soul as not to tremble and be
   abashed at the charges and reproaches deliberately urged against the
   rest of the shepherds.  A voice, he says, of the howling of the
   shepherds, for their glory is spoiled.  A voice of the roaring of
   lions, [2737] for this hath befallen them.  Does he not all but hear
   the wailing as if close at hand, and himself wail with the afflicted.
   A little further is a more striking and impassioned strain.  Feed, he
   says, the flock of slaughter, whose possessors slay them without
   repentance, and they that sell them say, "Blessed be the Lord, for we
   are rich:"  and their own shepherds are without feeling for them.
   Therefore, I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
   Lord Almighty. [2738]   And again:  Awake, O sword, against the
   shepherds, and smite the shepherds, and scatter the sheep, and I will
   turn My Hand upon the shepherds; [2739] and, Mine anger is kindled
   against the shepherds, and I will visit the lambs: [2740]   adding to
   the threat those who rule over the people.  So industriously does he
   apply himself to his task that he cannot easily free himself from
   denunciations, and I am afraid that, did I refer to the whole series, I
   should exhaust your patience.  This must then suffice for Zechariah.

   64.  Passing by the elders in the book of Daniel; [2741] for it is
   better to pass them by, together with the Lord's righteous sentence and
   declaration concerning them, that wickedness came from Babylon from
   ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people; how are we affected by
   Ezekiel, the beholder and expositor of the mighty mysteries and
   visions?  By his injunction to the watchmen [2742] not to keep silence
   concerning vice and the sword impending over it, a course which would
   profit neither themselves nor the sinners; but rather to keep watch and
   forewarn, and thus benefit, at any rate those who gave warning, if not
   both those who spoke and those who heard?

   65.  What of his further invective against the shepherds, Woe shall
   come upon woe, and rumour upon rumour, then shall they seek a vision of
   the prophet, but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from
   the ancients, [2743] and again, in these terms, Son of man, say unto
   her, thou art a land that is not watered, nor hath rain come upon thee
   in the day of indignation:  whose princes in the midst of her are like
   roaring lions, ravening the prey, devouring souls in their might.
   [2744]   And a little further on:  Her priests have violated My laws
   and profaned My holy things, they have put no difference between the
   holy and profane, but all things were alike to them, and they hid their
   eyes from My Sabbaths, and I was profaned among them. [2745]   He
   threatens that He will consume both the wall and them that daubed it,
   [2746] that is, those who sin and those who throw a cloak over them; as
   the evil rulers and priests have done, who caused the house of Israel
   to err according to their own hearts which are estranged in their
   lusts. [2747]

   66.  I also refrain from entering into his discussion of those who feed
   themselves, devour the milk, clothe themselves with the wool, kill them
   that are fat, but feed not the flock, strengthen not the diseased, nor
   bind up that which is broken, nor bring again that which is driven
   away, nor seek that which is lost, nor keep watch over that which is
   strong, but oppress them with rigour, and destroy them with their
   pressure; [2748] so that, because there was no shepherd, the sheep were
   scattered over every plain and mountain, and became meat for all the
   fowls and beasts, [2749] because there was no one to seek for them and
   bring them back.  What is the consequence?  As I live, saith the Lord,
   because these things are so, and My flock became a prey, [2750] behold
   I am against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hands,
   and will gather them and make them My own:  but the shepherds shall
   suffer such and such things, as bad shepherds ought.

   67.  However, to avoid unreasonably prolonging my discourse, by an
   enumeration of all the prophets, and of the words of them all, I will
   mention but one more, who was known before he was formed, and
   sanctified from the womb, [2751] Jeremiah:  and will pass over the
   rest.  He longs for water over his head, and a fountain of tears for
   his eyes, that he may adequately weep for Israel; [2752] and no less
   does he bewail the depravity of its rulers.

   68.  God speaks to him in reproof of the priests:  The priests said
   not, Where is the Lord, and they that handled the law knew Me not; the
   pastors also transgressed against Me. [2753]   Again He says to him:
   The pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord, and
   therefore all their flock did not understand, and was scattered. [2754]
     Again, Many pastors have destroyed My vineyard, and have polluted My
   pleasant portion, till it was reduced to a trackless wilderness. [2755]
     He further inveighs against the pastors again:  Woe be to the pastors
   that destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!  Therefore thus saith
   the Lord against them that feed My people:  Ye have scattered My flock,
   and driven them away, and have not visited them:  behold I will visit
   upon you the evil of your doings. [2756]   Moreover he bids the
   shepherds to howl, and the rams of the flock to lament, because the
   days of their slaughter are accomplished. [2757]

   69.  Why need I speak of the things of ancient days?  Who can test
   himself by the rules and standards which Paul laid down for bishops and
   presbyters, that they are to be temperate, soberminded, not given to
   wine, no strikers, apt to teach, blameless in all things, and beyond
   the reach of the wicked, [2758] without finding considerable deflection
   from the straight line of the rules?  What of the regulations of Jesus
   for his disciples, when He sends them to preach? [2759]   The main
   object of these is--not to enter into particulars--that they should be
   of such virtue, so simple and modest, and in a word, so heavenly, that
   the gospel should make its way, no less by their character than by
   their preaching.

   70.  I am alarmed by the reproaches of the Pharisees, the conviction of
   the Scribes.  For it is disgraceful for us, who ought greatly surpass
   them, as we are bidden, if we desire the kingdom of heaven, to be found
   more deeply sunk in vice:  so that we deserve to be called serpents, a
   generation of vipers, and blind guides, who strain out a gnat and
   swallow a camel, or sepulchres foul within, in spite of our external
   comeliness, or platters outwardly clean, and everything else, which
   they are, or which is laid to their charge. [2760]

   71.  With these thoughts I am occupied night and day:  they waste my
   marrow, and feed upon my flesh, and will not allow me to be confident
   or to look up.  They depress my soul, and abase my mind, and fetter my
   tongue, and make me consider, not the position of a prelate, or the
   guidance and direction of others, which is far beyond my powers; but
   how I myself am to escape the wrath to come, and to scrape off from
   myself somewhat of the rust of vice.  A man must himself be cleansed,
   before cleansing others:  himself become wise, that he may make others
   wise; become light, and then give light:  draw near to God, and so
   bring others near; be hallowed, then hallow them; be possessed of hands
   to lead others by the hand, of wisdom to give advice.

   72.  When will this be, say they who are swift but not sure in every
   thing, readily building up, readily throwing down.  When will the lamp
   be upon its stand, [2761] and where is the talent? [2762]   For so they
   call the grace. [2763]   Those who speak thus are more fervent in
   friendship than in reverence.  You ask me, you men of exceeding
   courage, when these things shall be, and what account I give of them?
   Not even extreme old age would be too long a limit to assign.  For
   hoary hairs combined with prudence are better than inexperienced youth,
   well-reasoned hesitation than inconsiderate haste, and a brief reign
   than a long tyranny:  just as a small portion honourably won is better
   than considerable possessions which are dishonourable and uncertain, a
   little gold than a great weight of lead, a little light than much
   darkness.

   73.  But this speed, in its untrustworthiness and excessive haste, is
   in danger of being like the seeds which fell upon the rock, [2764] and,
   because they had no depth of earth, [2765] sprang up at once, but could
   not bear even the first heat of the sun; or like the foundation laid
   upon the sand, [2766] which could not even make a slight resistance to
   the rain and the winds.  Woe to thee, O city, whose king is a child,
   [2767] says Solomon.  Be not hasty of speech, [2768] says Solomon
   again, asserting that hastiness of speech is less serious than heated
   action.  And who, in spite of all this, demands haste rather than
   security and utility?  Who can mould, as clay-figures are modelled in a
   single day, the defender of the truth, who is to take his stand with
   Angels, and give glory with Archangels, and cause the sacrifice to
   ascend to the altar on high, and share the priesthood of Christ, and
   renew the creature, and set forth the image, and create inhabitants for
   the world above, aye and, greatest of all, be God, and make others to
   be God?

   74.  I know Whose ministers we are, and where we are placed, and
   whither we are guides.  I know the height of God, and the weakness of
   man, and, on the contrary, his power.  Heaven is high, and the earth
   deep; [2769] and who of those who have been cast down by sin shall
   ascend? [2770]   Who that is as yet surrounded by the gloom here below,
   and by the grossness of the flesh can purely gaze with his whole mind
   upon that whole mind, and amid unstable and visible things hold
   intercourse with the stable and invisible?  For hardly may one of those
   who have been most specially purged, behold here even an image of the
   Good, as men see the sun in the water.  Who hath measured the water
   with his hand, and the heaven with a span, and the whole earth in a
   measure?  Who hath weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
   balance? [2771]   What is the place of his rest? [2772] and to whom
   shall he be likened? [2773]

   75.  Who is it, Who made all things by His Word, [2774] and formed man
   by His Wisdom, and gathered into one things scattered abroad, and
   mingled dust with spirit, and compounded an animal visible and
   invisible, temporal and immortal, earthly and heavenly, able to attain
   to God but not to comprehend Him, drawing near and yet afar off.  I
   said, I will be wise, says Solomon, but she (i.e. Wisdom) was far from
   me beyond what is: [2775]   and, Verily, he that increaseth knowledge
   increaseth sorrow. [2776]   For the joy of what we have discovered is
   no greater than the pain of what escapes us; a pain, I imagine, like
   that felt by those who are dragged, while yet thirsty, from the water,
   or are unable to retain what they think they hold, or are suddenly left
   in the dark by a flash of lightning.

   76.  This depressed and kept me humble, and persuaded me that it was
   better to hear the voice of praise [2777] than to be an expounder of
   truths beyond my power; the majesty, and the height, and the dignity,
   and the pure natures scarce able to contain the brightness of God, Whom
   the deep covers, Whose secret place is darkness, [2778] since He is the
   purest light, [2779] which most men cannot approach unto; Who is in all
   this universe, and again is beyond the universe; Who is all goodness,
   [2780] and beyond all goodness; Who enlightens the mind, and escapes
   the quickness and height of the mind, ever retiring as much as He is
   apprehended, and by His flight and stealing away when grasped,
   withdrawing to the things above one who is enamoured of Him.

   77.  Such and so great is the object of our longing zeal, and such a
   man should he be, who prepares and conducts souls to their espousals.
   For myself, I feared to be cast, bound hand and foot, [2781] from the
   bride-chamber, for not having on a wedding-garment, and for having
   rashly intruded among those who there sit at meat.  And yet I had been
   invited from my youth, if I may speak of what most men know not, and
   had been cast upon Him from the womb, [2782] and presented by the
   promise of my mother, afterwards confirmed in the hour of danger:  and
   my longing grew up with it, and my reason agreed to it, and I gave as
   an offering my all to Him Who had won me and saved me, my property, my
   fame, my health, my very words, from which I only gained the advantage
   of being able to despise them, and of having something in comparison of
   which I preferred Christ.  And the words of God were made sweet as
   honeycombs [2783] to me, and I cried after knowledge and lifted up my
   voice for wisdom. [2784]   There was moreover the moderation of anger,
   the curbing of the tongue, the restraint of the eyes, the discipline of
   the belly, and the trampling under foot of the glory which clings to
   the earth.  I speak foolishly, [2785] but it shall be said, in these
   pursuits I was perhaps not inferior to many.

   78.  One branch of philosophy is, however, too high for me, the
   commission to guide and govern souls--and before I have rightly learned
   to submit to a shepherd, or have had my soul duly cleansed, the charge
   of caring for a flock:  especially in times like these, when a man,
   seeing everyone else rushing hither and thither in confusion, is
   content to flee from the melee and escape, in sheltered retirement,
   from the storm and gloom of the wicked one:  when the members are at
   war with one another, and the slight remains of love, which once
   existed, have departed, and priest is a mere empty name, since, as it
   is said, contempt [2786] has been poured upon princes. [2787]

   79.  Would that it were merely empty!  And now may their blasphemy fall
   upon the head of the ungodly!  All fear has been banished from souls,
   shamelessness has taken its place, and knowledge [2788] and the deep
   things of the Spirit [2789] are at the disposal of anyone who will; and
   we all become pious by simply condemning the impiety of others; and we
   claim the services of ungodly judges, [2790] and fling that which is
   holy to the dogs, and cast pearls before swine, [2791] by publishing
   divine things in the hearing of profane souls, and, wretches that we
   are, carefully fulfil the prayers of our enemies, and are not ashamed
   to go a whoring with our own inventions. [2792]   Moabites and
   Ammonites, who were not permitted even to enter the Church of the Lord,
   [2793] frequent our most holy rites.  We have opened to all not the
   gates of righteousness, [2794] but, doors of railing and partizan
   arrogance; and the first place among us is given, not to one who in the
   fear of God refrains from even an idle word, but to him who can revile
   his neighbour most fluently, whether explicitly, or by covert allusion;
   who rolls beneath his tongue mischief and iniquity, or to speak more
   accurately, the poison of asps. [2795]

   80.  We observe each other's sins, not to bewail them, but to make them
   subjects of reproach, not to heal them, but to aggravate them, and
   excuse our own evil deeds by the wounds of our neighbours.  Bad and
   good men are distinguished not according to personal character, but by
   their disagreement or friendship with ourselves.  We praise one day
   what we revile the next, denunciation at the hands of others is a
   passport to our admiration; so magnanimous are we in our viciousness,
   that everything is frankly forgiven to impiety.

   81.  Everything has reverted to the original state of things [2796]
   before the world, with its present fair order and form, came into
   being.  The general confusion and irregularity cry for some organising
   hand and power.  Or, if you will, it is like a battle at night by the
   faint light of the moon, when none can discern the faces of friends or
   foes; or like a sea fight on the surge, with the driving winds, and
   boiling foam, and dashing waves, and crashing vessels, with the thrusts
   of poles, the pipes of boatswains, the groans of the fallen, while we
   make our voices heard above the din, and not knowing what to do, and
   having, alas! no opportunity for showing our valour, assail one
   another, and fall by one another's hands.

   82.  Nor indeed is there any distinction between the state of the
   people and that of the priesthood:  but it seems to me to be a simple
   fulfilment of the ancient curse, "As with the people so with the
   priest." [2797]   Nor again are the great and eminent men affected
   otherwise than the majority; nay, they are openly at war with the
   priests, and their piety is an aid to their powers of persuasion.  And
   indeed, provided that it be on behalf of the faith, and of the highest
   and most important questions, let them be thus disposed, and I blame
   them not; nay, to say the truth, I go so far as to praise and
   congratulate them.  Yea! would that I were one of those who contend and
   incur hatred for the truth's sake:  or rather, I can boast of being one
   of them.  For better is a laudable war than a peace which severs a man
   from God:  and therefore it is that the Spirit arms the gentle warrior,
   as one who is able to wage war in a good cause.

   83.  But at the present time there are some who go to war even about
   small matters and to no purpose, and, with great ignorance and
   audacity, accept, as an associate in their ill-doing, anyone whoever he
   may be.  Then everyone makes the faith his pretext, and this venerable
   name is dragged into their private quarrels.  Consequently, as was
   probable, we are hated, even among the Gentiles, and, what is harder
   still, we cannot say that this is without just cause.  Nay, even the
   best of our own people are scandalized, while this result is not
   surprising in the case of the multitude, who are ill-disposed to accept
   anything that is good.

   84.  Sinners are planning upon our backs; [2798] and what we devise
   against each other, they turn against us all:  and we have become a new
   spectacle, not to angels and men, [2799] as says Paul, that bravest of
   athletes, in his contest with principalities and powers, [2800] but to
   almost all wicked men, and at every time and place, in the public
   squares, at carousals, at festivities, and times of sorrow.  Nay, we
   have already--I can scarcely speak of it without tears--been
   represented on the stage, amid the laughter of the most licentious, and
   the most popular of all dialogues and scenes is the caricature of a
   Christian.

   85.  These are the results of our intestine warfare, and our extreme
   readiness to strive about goodness and gentleness, and our inexpedient
   excess of love for God.  Wrestling, or any other athletic contest, is
   only permitted according to fixed laws, and the man will be shouted
   down and disgraced, and lose the victory, who breaks the laws of
   wrestling, or acts unfairly in any other contest, contrary to the rules
   laid down for the contest, however able and skilful he may be; and
   shall anyone contend for Christ in an unchristlike manner, and yet be
   pleasing to peace for having fought unlawfully in her name.

   86.  Yea, even now, when Christ is invoked, the devils tremble, [2801]
   and not even by our ill-doing has the power of this Name been
   extinguished, while we are not ashamed to insult a cause and name so
   venerable; shouting it, and having it shouted in return, almost in
   public, and every day; for My Name is blasphemed among the Gentiles
   because of you. [2802]

   87.  Of external warfare I am not afraid, nor of that wild beast, and
   fulness of evil, who has now arisen against the churches, though he may
   threaten fire, sword, wild beasts, precipices, chasms; though he may
   show himself more inhuman than all previous madmen, and discover fresh
   tortures of greater severity.  I have one remedy for them all, one road
   to victory; I will glory in Christ [2803] namely, death for Christ's
   sake.

   88.  For my own warfare, however, I am at a loss what course to pursue,
   what alliance, what word of wisdom, what grace to devise, with what
   panoply to arm myself, against the wiles of the wicked one. [2804]
   What Moses is to conquer him by stretching out his hands upon the
   mount, [2805] in order that the cross, thus typified and prefigured,
   may prevail?  What Joshua, as his successor, arrayed alongside the
   Captain of the Lord's hosts? [2806]   What David, either by harping, or
   fighting with his sling, [2807] and girded by God with strength unto
   the battle, [2808] and with his fingers trained to war? [2809]   What
   Samuel, praying [2810] and sacrificing for the people, and anointing as
   king one who can gain the victory?  What Jeremiah, by writing
   lamentations for Israel, is fitly to lament these things?

   89.  Who will cry aloud, Spare Thy People, O Lord, and give not Thine
   heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them? [2811]
   What Noah, and Job, [2812] and Daniel, who are reckoned together as men
   of prayer, will pray for us, that we may have a slight respite from
   warfare, and recover ourselves, and recognize one another for a while,
   and no longer, instead of united Israel, be Judah [2813] and Israel,
   Rehoboam and Jeroboam, Jerusalem and Samaria, in turn delivered up
   because of our sins, and in turn lamented.

   90.  For I own that I am too weak for this warfare, and therefore
   turned my back, hiding my face in the rout, and sat solitary, [2814]
   because I was filled with bitterness [2815] and sought to be silent,
   understanding that it is an evil time, [2816] that the beloved had
   kicked, [2817] that we were become backsliding children, [2818] who are
   the luxuriant vine, [2819] the true vine, all fruitful, all beautiful,
   [2820] springing up splendidly with showers from on high. [2821]   For
   the diadem of beauty, [2822] the signet of glory, [2823] the crown of
   magnificence [2824] has been changed for me into shame; and if anyone,
   in face of these things, is daring and courageous, he has my blessing
   on his daring and courage.

   91.  I have said nothing yet of the internal warfare within ourselves,
   and in our passions, in which we are engaged night and day against the
   body of our humiliation, [2825] either secretly or openly, and against
   the tide which tosses and whirls us hither and thither, by the aid of
   our senses and other sources of the pleasures of this life; and against
   the miry clay [2826] in which we have been fixed; and against the law
   of sin, [2827] which wars against the law of the spirit, and strives to
   destroy the royal image in us, and all the divine emanation which has
   been bestowed upon us; so that it is difficult for anyone, either by a
   long course of philosophic training, and gradual separation of the
   noble and enlightened part of the soul from that which is debased and
   yoked with darkness, or by the mercy of God, or by both together, and
   by a constant practice of looking upward, to overcome the depressing
   power of matter.  And before a man has, as far as possible, gained this
   superiority, and sufficiently purified his mind, and far surpassed his
   fellows in nearness to God, I do not think it safe for him to be
   entrusted with the rule over souls, or the office of mediator (for
   such, I take it, a priest is) between God and man.

   92.  What is it that has induced this fear in me, that, instead of
   supposing me to be needlessly afraid, you may highly commend my
   foresight?  I hear from Moses himself, when God spake to him, that,
   although many were bidden to come to the mount, one of whom was even
   Aaron, with his two sons who were priests, and seventy elders of the
   senate, the rest were ordered to worship afar off, and Moses alone to
   draw near, and the people were not to go up with him. [2828]   For it
   is not everyone who may draw near to God, but only one who, like Moses,
   can bear the glory of God.  Moreover, before this, when the law was
   first given, the trumpet-blasts, and lightnings, and thunders, and
   darkness, and the smoke of the whole mountain, [2829] and the terrible
   threats that if even a beast touched the mountain it should be stoned,
   [2830] and other like alarms, kept back the rest of the people, for
   whom it was a great privilege, after careful purification, merely to
   hear the voice of God.  But Moses actually went up and entered into the
   cloud, [2831] and was charged with the law, and received the tables,
   which belong, for the multitude, to the letter, but, for those who are
   above the multitude, to the spirit. [2832]

   93.  I hear again that Nadab and Abihu, for having merely offered
   incense with strange fire, were with strange fire destroyed, [2833] the
   instrument of their impiety being used for their punishment, and their
   destruction following at the very time and place of their sacrilege;
   and not even their father Aaron, who was next to Moses in the favor of
   God, could save them.  I know also of Eli the priest, and a little
   later of Uzzah, the former made to pay the penalty for his sons'
   transgression, in daring to violate the sacrifices by an untimely
   exaction of the first fruits of the cauldrons, although he did not
   condone their impiety, but frequently rebuked them; [2834] the other,
   because he only touched the ark, which was being thrown off the cart by
   the ox, [2835] and though he saved it, was himself destroyed, in God's
   jealousy for the reverence due to the ark.

   94.  I know also that not even bodily blemishes in either priests
   [2836] or victims [2837] passed without notice, but that it was
   required by the law that perfect sacrifices must be offered by perfect
   men--a symbol, I take it, of integrity of soul.  It was not lawful for
   everyone to touch the priestly vesture, or any of the holy vessels; nor
   might the sacrifices themselves be consumed except by the proper
   persons, and at the proper time and place; [2838] nor might the
   anointing oil nor the compounded incense [2839] be imitated; nor might
   anyone enter the temple who was not in the most minute particular pure
   in both soul and body; so far was the Holy of holies removed from
   presumptuous access, that it might be entered by one man only once a
   year; [2840] so far were the veil, and the mercy-seat, and the ark, and
   the Cherubim, from the general gaze and touch.

   95.  Since then I knew these things, and that no one is worthy of the
   mightiness of God, and the sacrifice, and priesthood, who has not first
   presented himself to God, a living, holy sacrifice, and set forth the
   reasonable, well-pleasing service, [2841] and sacrificed to God the
   sacrifice of praise and the contrite spirit, [2842] which is the only
   sacrifice required of us by the Giver of all; how could I dare to offer
   to Him the external sacrifice, the antitype of the great mysteries,
   [2843] or clothe myself with the garb and name of priest, before my
   hands had been consecrated by holy works; before my eyes had been
   accustomed to gaze safely upon created things, with wonder only for the
   Creator, and without injury to the creature; before my ear had been
   sufficiently opened to the instruction of the Lord, and He had opened
   mine ear to hear [2844] without heaviness, and had set a golden earring
   with precious sardius, that is, a wise man's word in an obedient ear;
   [2845] before my mouth had been opened to draw in the Spirit, [2846]
   and opened wide to be filled [2847] with the spirit of speaking
   mysteries and doctrines; [2848] and my lips bound, [2849] to use the
   words of wisdom, by divine knowledge, and, as I would add, loosed in
   due season:  before my tongue had been filled with exultation, and
   become an instrument of Divine melody, awaking with glory, awaking
   right early, [2850] and laboring till it cleave to my jaws: [2851]
   before my feet had been set upon the rock, [2852] made like hart's
   feet, and my footsteps directed in a godly fashion so that they should
   not well-nigh slip, [2853] nor slip at all; before all my members had
   become instruments of righteousness, [2854] and all mortality had been
   put off, and swallowed up of life, [2855] and had yielded to the
   Spirit?

   96.  Who is the man, whose heart has never been made to burn, [2856] as
   the Scriptures have been opened to him, with the pure words of God
   which have been tried in a furnace; [2857] who has not, by a triple
   [2858] inscription [2859] of them upon the breadth of his heart,
   attained the mind of Christ; [2860] nor been admitted to the treasures
   which to most men remain hidden, secret, and dark, to gaze upon the
   riches therein? [2861] and become able to enrich others, comparing
   spiritual things with spiritual. [2862]

   97.  Who is the man who has never beheld, as our duty is to behold it,
   the fair beauty of the Lord, nor has visited His temple, [2863] or
   rather, become the temple of God, [2864] and the habitation of Christ
   in the Spirit? [2865]   Who is the man who has never recognized the
   correlation and distinction between figures and the truth, so that by
   withdrawing from the former and cleaving to the latter, and by thus
   escaping from the oldness of the letter and serving the newness of the
   spirit, [2866] he may clean pass over to grace from the law, which
   finds its spiritual fulfilment in the dissolution of the body. [2867]

   98.  Who is the man who has never, by experience and contemplation,
   traversed the entire series of the titles [2868] and powers of Christ,
   both those more lofty ones which originally were His, and those more
   lowly ones which He later assumed for our sake--viz.:  God, the Son,
   the Image, the Word, the Wisdom, the Truth, the Light, the Life, the
   Power, the Vapour, the Emanation, the Effulgence, the Maker, the King,
   the Head, the Law, the Way, the Door, the Foundation, the Rock, the
   Pearl, the Peace, the Righteousness, the Sanctification, the
   Redemption, the Man, the Servant, the Shepherd, the Lamb, the High
   Priest, the Victim, the Firstborn before creation, the Firstborn from
   the dead, the Resurrection:  who is the man who hearkens, but pays no
   heed, to these names so pregnant with reality, and has never yet held
   communion with, nor been made partaker of, the Word, in any of the real
   relations signified by each of these names which He bears?

   99.  Who, in fine, is the man who, although he has never applied
   himself to, nor learnt to speak, the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery,
   [2869] although he is still a babe, still fed with milk, [2870] still
   of those who are not numbered in Israel, [2871] nor enrolled in the
   army of God, although he is not yet able to take up the Cross of Christ
   like a man, although he is possibly not yet one of the more honorable
   members, yet will joyfully and eagerly accept his appointment as head
   of the fulness of Christ? [2872]   No one, if he will listen to my
   judgment and accept my advice!  This is of all things most to be
   feared, this is the extremest of dangers in the eyes of everyone who
   understands the magnitude of success, the utter ruin of failure.

   100.  Let others sail for merchandise, I used to say, and cross the
   wide oceans, and constantly contend with winds and waves, to gain great
   wealth, if so it should chance, and run great risks in their eagerness
   for sailing and merchandise; but, for my part, I greatly prefer to stay
   ashore and plough a short but pleasant furrow, saluting at a respectful
   distance the sea and its gains, to live as best I can upon a poor and
   scanty store of barley-bread, and drag my life along in safety and
   calm, rather than expose myself to so long and great a risk for the
   sake of great gains.

   101.  For one in high estate, if he fail to make further progress and
   to disseminate virtue still more widely, and contents himself with
   slight results, incurs punishment, as having spent a great light upon
   the illumination of a little house, or girt round the limbs of a boy
   the full armor of a man.  On the contrary, a man of low estate may with
   safety assume a light burden, and escape the risk of the ridicule and
   increased danger which would attend him if he attempted a task beyond
   his powers.  For, as we have heard, it is not seemly for a man to build
   a tower, unless he has sufficient to finish it. [2873]

   102.  Such is the defence which I have been able to make, perhaps at
   immoderate length, for my flight.  Such are the reasons which, to my
   pain and possibly to yours, carried me away from you, my friends and
   brothers; yet, as it seemed to me at the time, with irresistible
   force.  My longing after you, and the sense of your longing for me,
   have, more than anything else, led to my return, for nothing inclines
   us so strongly to love as mutual affection.

   103.  In the next place there was my care, my duty, the hoar hairs and
   weakness of my holy parents, who were more greatly distressed on my
   account than by their advanced age--of this Patriarch Abraham whose
   person is honored by me, and numbered among the angels, and of Sarah,
   who travailed in my spiritual birth by instructing me in the truth.
   Now, I had specially pledged myself to become the stay of their old age
   and the support of their weakness, a pledge which, to the best of my
   power, I have fulfilled, even at the expense of philosophy itself, the
   most precious of possessions and titles to me; or, to speak more truly,
   although I made it the first object of my philosophy to appear to be no
   philosopher, I could not bear that my labor in consequence of a single
   purpose should be wasted, nor yet that blessing should be lost, which
   one of the saints of old is said to have stolen from his father, whom
   he deceived by the food which he offered to him, and the hairy
   appearance he assumed, thus attaining a good object by disgraceful
   trickery. [2874]   These are the two causes of my submission and
   tractability.  Nor is it, perchance, unreasonable that my arguments
   should yield and submit to them both, for there is a time to be
   conquered, as I also think there is for every purpose, [2875] and it is
   better to be honorably overcome than to win a dangerous and lawless
   victory.

   104.  There is a third reason of the highest importance which I will
   further mention, and then dismiss the rest.  I remembered the days of
   old, [2876] and, recurring to one of the ancient histories, drew
   counsel for myself therefrom as to my present conduct; for let us not
   suppose these events to have been recorded without a purpose, nor that
   they are a mere assemblage of words and deeds gathered together for the
   pastime of those who listen to them, as a kind of bait for the ears,
   for the sole purpose of giving pleasure.  Let us leave such jesting to
   the legends and the Greeks, who think but little of the truth, and
   enchant ear and mind by the charm of their fictions and the daintiness
   of their style.

   105.  We however, who extend the accuracy of the Spirit to the merest
   stroke and tittle, [2877] will never admit the impious assertion that
   even the smallest matters were dealt with haphazard by those who have
   recorded them, and have thus been borne in mind down to the present
   day:  on the contrary, their purpose has been to supply memorials and
   instructions for our consideration under similar circumstances, should
   such befall us, and that the examples of the past might serve as rules
   and models, for our warning and imitation.

   106.  What then is the story, and wherein lies its application?  For,
   perhaps, it would not be amiss to relate it, for the general security.
   Jonah also was fleeing from the face of God, [2878] or rather, thought
   that he was fleeing:  but he was overtaken by the sea, and the storm,
   and the lot, and the whale's belly, and the three days' entombment, the
   type of a greater mystery.  He fled from having to announce the dread
   and awful message to the Ninevites, and from being subsequently, if the
   city was saved by repentance, convicted of falsehood:  not that he was
   displeased at the salvation of the wicked, but he was ashamed of being
   made an instrument of falsehood, and exceedingly zealous for the credit
   of prophecy, which was in danger of being destroyed in his person,
   since most men are unable to penetrate the depth of the Divine
   dispensation in such cases.

   107.  But, as I have learned from a man [2879] skilled in these
   subjects, and able to grasp the depth of the prophet, by means of a
   reasonable explanation of what seems unreasonable in the history, it
   was not this which caused Jonah to flee, and carried him to Joppa and
   again from Joppa to Tarshish, when he entrusted his stolen self to the
   sea: [2880]   for it was not likely that such a prophet should be
   ignorant of the design of God, viz., to bring about, by means of the
   threat, the escape of the Ninevites from the threatened doom, according
   to His great wisdom, and unsearchable judgments, and according to His
   ways which are beyond our tracing and finding out; [2881] nor that, if
   he knew this he would refuse to co-operate with God in the use of the
   means which He designed for their salvation.  Besides, to imagine that
   Jonah hoped to hide himself at sea, and escape by his flight the great
   eye of God, is surely utterly absurd and stupid, and unworthy of
   credit, not only in the case of a prophet, but even in the case of any
   sensible man, who has only a slight perception of God, Whose power is
   over all.

   108.  On the contrary, as my instructor said, and as I am myself
   convinced, Jonah knew better than any one the purpose of his message to
   the Ninevites, and that, in planning his flight, although he changed
   his place, he did not escape from God.  Nor is this possible for any
   one else, either by concealing himself in the bosom of the earth, or in
   the depths of the sea, or by soaring on wings, if there be any means of
   doing so, and rising into the air, or by abiding in the lowest depths
   of hell, [2882] or by enveloping himself in a thick cloud, or by any
   other of the many devices for ensuring escape.  For God alone of all
   things cannot be escaped from or contended with; if He wills to seize
   and bring them under His hand, He outstrips the swift, He outwits the
   wise, He overthrows the strong, He abases the lofty, He subdues
   rashness, He represses power.

   109.  Jonah then was not ignorant of the mighty hand of God, with which
   he threatened other men, nor did he imagine that he could utterly
   escape the Divine power; this we are not to believe:  but when he saw
   the falling away of Israel, and perceived the passing over of the grace
   of prophecy to the Gentiles--this was the cause of his retirement from
   preaching and of his delay in fulfilling the command; accordingly he
   left the watchtower of joy, for this is the meaning of Joppa in Hebrew,
   I mean his former dignity and reputation, and flung himself into the
   deep of sorrow:  and hence he is tempest-tossed, and falls asleep, and
   is wrecked, and aroused from sleep, and taken by lot, and confesses his
   flight, and is cast into sea, and swallowed, but not destroyed, by the
   whale; but there he calls upon God, and, marvellous as it is, on the
   third day he, like Christ, is delivered:  but my treatment of this
   topic must stand over, and shall shortly, if God permit, be more
   deliberately worked out. [2883]

   110.  Now however, to return to my original point, the thought and
   question occurred to me, that although he might possibly meet with some
   indulgence, if reluctant to prophesy, for the cause which I
   mentioned--yet, in my own case, what could be said, what defence could
   be made, if I longer remained restive, and rejected the yoke of
   ministry, which, though I know not whether to call it light or heavy,
   had at any rate been laid upon me.

   111.  For if it be granted, and this alone can be strongly asserted in
   such matters, that we are far too low to perform the priest's office
   before God, and that we can only be worthy of the sanctuary after we
   have become worthy of the Church, [2884] and worthy of the post of
   president, after being worthy of the sanctuary, yet some one else may
   perhaps refuse to acquit us on the charge of disobedience.  Now
   terrible are the threatenings against disobedience, and terrible are
   the penalties which ensue upon it; as indeed are those on the other
   side, if, instead of being reluctant, and shrinking back, and
   concealing ourselves as Saul did among his father's stuff [2885]
   --although called to rule but for a short time--if, I say, we come
   forward readily, as though to a slight and most easy task, whereas it
   is not safe even to resign it, nor to amend by second thoughts our
   first.

   112.  On this account I had much toilsome consideration to discover my
   duty, being set in the midst betwixt two fears, of which the one held
   me back, the other urged me on.  For a long while I was at a loss
   between them, and after wavering from side to side, and, like a current
   driven by inconstant winds, inclining first in this direction, then in
   that, I at last yielded to the stronger, and the fear of disobedience
   overcame me, and has carried me off.  Pray, mark how accurately and
   justly I hold the balance between the fears, neither desiring an office
   not given to me, nor rejecting it when given.  The one course marks the
   rash, the other the disobedient, both the undisciplined.  My position
   lies between those who are too bold, or too timid; more timid than
   those who rush at every position, more bold than those who avoid them
   all.  This is my judgment on the matter.

   113.  Moreover, to distinguish still more clearly between them, we
   have, against the fear of office, a possible help in the law of
   obedience, inasmuch as God in His goodness rewards our faith, and makes
   a perfect ruler of the man who has confidence in Him, and places all
   his hopes in Him; but against the danger of disobedience I know of
   nothing which can help us, and of no ground to encourage our
   confidence.  For it is to be feared that we shall have to hear these
   words concerning those who have been entrusted to us:  I will require
   their souls at your hands; [2886] and, Because ye have rejected me, and
   not been leaders and rulers of my people, I also will reject you, that
   I should not be king over you; [2887] and, As ye refused to hearken to
   My voice, and turned a stubborn back, and were disobedient, so shall it
   be when ye call upon Me, and I will not regard nor give ear to your
   prayer. [2888]   God forbid that these words should come to us from the
   just Judge, for when we sing of His mercy we must also by all means
   sing of His judgment. [2889]

   114.  I resort once again to history, and on considering the men of
   best repute in ancient days, who were ever preferred by grace to the
   office of ruler or prophet, I discover that some readily complied with
   the call, others deprecated the gift, and that neither those who drew
   back were blamed for timidity, nor those who came forward for
   eagerness.  The former stood in awe of the greatness of the ministry,
   the latter trustfully obeyed Him Who called them.  Aaron was eager, but
   Moses resisted, [2890] Isaiah readily submitted, but Jeremiah was
   afraid of his youth, [2891] and did not venture to prophesy until he
   had received from God a promise and power beyond his years. [2892]

   115.  By these arguments I charmed myself, and by degrees my soul
   relaxed and became ductile, like iron, and time came to the aid of my
   arguments, and the testimonies of God, to which I had entrusted my
   whole life, were my counsellors. [2893]   Therefore I was not
   rebellious, neither turned away back, [2894] saith my Lord, when,
   instead of being called to rule, He was led, as a sheep to the
   slaughter; [2895] but I fell down and humbled myself under the mighty
   hand of God, [2896] and asked pardon for my former idleness and
   disobedience, if this is at all laid to my charge.  I held my peace,
   [2897] but I will not hold my peace for ever:  I withdrew for a little
   while, [2898] till I had considered myself and consoled my grief:  but
   now I am commissioned to exalt Him in the congregation of the people,
   and praise Him in the seat of the elders. [2899]   If my former conduct
   deserved blame, my present action merits pardon.

   116.  What further need is there of words.  Here am I, my pastors and
   fellow-pastors, here am I, thou holy flock, worthy of Christ, the Chief
   Shepherd, [2900] here am I, my father, utterly vanquished, and your
   subject according to the laws of Christ rather than according to those
   of the land: [2901]   here is my obedience, reward it with your
   blessing.  Lead me with your prayers, guide me with your words,
   establish me with your spirit.  The blessing of the father establisheth
   the houses of children, [2902] and would that both I and this spiritual
   house may be established, the house which I have longed for, which I
   pray may be my rest for ever, [2903] when I have been passed on from
   the church here to the church yonder, the general assembly of the
   firstborn, who are written in heaven. [2904]

   117.  Such is my defence:  its reasonableness I have set forth:  and
   may the God of peace, [2905] Who made both one, [2906] and has restored
   us to each other, Who setteth kings upon thrones, and raiseth up the
   poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill,
   [2907] Who chose David His servant and took him away from the
   sheepfolds, [2908] though he was the least and youngest of the sons of
   Jesse, [2909] Who gave the word [2910] to those who preach the gospel
   with great power for the perfection of the gospel,--may He Himself hold
   me by my right hand, and guide me with His counsel, and receive me with
   glory, [2911] Who is a Shepherd [2912] to shepherds and a Guide to
   guides:  that we may feed His flock with knowledge, [2913] not with the
   instruments of a foolish shepherd, [2914] according to the blessing,
   and not according to the curse pronounced against the men of former
   days:  may He give strength and power unto his people, [2915] and
   Himself present to Himself [2916] His flock resplendent and spotless
   and worthy of the fold on high, in the habitation of them that rejoice,
   [2917] in the splendour of the saints, [2918] so that in His temple
   everyone, both flock and shepherds together may say, Glory, [2919] in
   Christ Jesus our Lord, to Whom be all glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

   [2549] One member.  The Ben. editors object to this translation (which
   is that of Rufinus, Billius and Gabriel) as inconsistent with the
   following allusion to the relation of the soul to the body.  It seems,
   however, more in harmony with the figure of S. Paul, who compares the

   [2555] A great thing.  The Ben. editors note the obscurity of the
   original here.

   [2556] Accept, dechesthai.  Many mss have harchesthai, preserving the
   play upon the word archein.  The latter reading, the Ben. editors
   suggest, may have an active sense, as Hom. Il. II. 345.

   [2558] Hos. iii. 4.

   [2559] Philosophy.  philosophia is used by S. Greg. and other Fathers
   in various senses, not always clearly distinguishable.  Sometimes it
   refers to the ancient philosophical teachers and schools:  sometimes to
   the Christian philosophy, which inculcates Divine truth, and teaches
   the principles of a good and holy life:  sometimes to the practice of
   these principles, either in regard to some special virtue, e.g.
   patience, or, in general, in the lives of individual Christians, and
   further, as involving the most careful and extensive reduction of these
   principles to practice--the discipline of the monastic life.  Cf.
   Suicer, in verb.

   [2560] Eager longing.  Nearly all mss. read "pity"--which would have to
   be understood in the sense of "regretful affection."

   [2561] 1 Cor. xiv. 28.

   [2562] S. Mark vii. 5.

   [2563] The sanctuary.  i.e. That which gave the right to a place in the
   sanctuary,--the priesthood.  Billius wrongly takes it of the
   episcopate.

   [2564] Piety--for it is a mere external pretence, deceiving themselves
   as well as others.  eisebaia here has the double sense of piety and
   orthodoxy--the former being the more prominent.

   [2582] Our will.  Clémencet compares S. Bernard, de Gratia et Libero
   Arbitrio, xiv. 47 (tom. i. 1397, Gaume).  Petavius, de Incarn., tom.
   v., p. 416, lib. IX., iii., 11, comments on this passage in treating of
   free will.

   [2583] Its subject matter, i.e. the affection of the sick body, which
   it is the object of medicine to change to its opposite.  So Combefis.

   [2595] One consisting, &c.  "These words," says Gabriel, "are indeed a
   two-edged sword against the heretics, for one clause mortally wounds
   Nestorius who separates the Divine from the Human Nature--the other
   Eutyches, who empties the human into the Divine."

   [2596] Was united, anekrathe, lit., "was blended"--cf. Orat. xxxviii.
   13.  This and similar terms used by Gregory and his contemporaries in
   an orthodox sense were laid aside by later Fathers, in consequence of
   their having been perverted in favor of the Eutychian heresy.

   [2597] By means of the soul, Cf. Orat. xxix. 19; xxxviii. 13; Epist.
   101 (tom. 2, p. 90 A.):  Poem. Dogmat., x., 55-61 (tom. 2, p. 256);

   [2617] Those who, &c. migadas, cf. xxi., 10, where monadikoi and hoi
   tes ereuias are distinguished from migades and hoi tes epimixias.
   Clémencet here holds that hoi tes eremias are hermits as distinguished
   from coenobites, but does not hint at any further subdivision between
   the koinonikoi and the migades.  Cf. also xliii. 62; xxi. 19.  Montaut,
   "Revue Critique, &c." (pp. 48-52) attempts to distinguish between the
   migades and the koinonikoi.  But although he confirms the overthrow by
   Clémencet of the views of previous translators, he leaves Clémencet's
   own position really unweakened.  S. Gregory uses the two terms as
   practically convertible.  In xxi., § 19, (which Montaut misinterprets)
   he explains that the life of the coenobite is a hermit-life in its
   relation to the world which he has forsaken, while it has opportunities
   in community-life for the growth of those virtues which are required by
   the relation of man to man.  Cf. Bened. edition (Clémencet), Præf.
   Gener., Pars. II., § iii. sub finem.

   [2618] The source of persuasiveness, lit., "the medicine of
   persuasion."

   [2619] condescension, lit., equity,' dealing gently with their
   weakness, not exacting the literal fulfilment of the law.

   [2624] Worlds, i.e. the invisible and visible, of which S. Greg. held
   that the former was created before the latter. cf. Orat. xviii. 3;
   xxvii. 10; xxviii. 31; xxxviii. 10; xl. 45.

   [2625] Dissolution; some translate return'--i.e. of the Ascension;
   referring the resurrection, &c.' to mankind in general.

   [2626] Original.  Perhaps better supreme.'

   [2627] Illumination.  Some apply this to Holy Baptism, with its
   preliminary instruction.

   [2628] Contracting, i.e. by the Sabellian heresy.  A parallel passage
   in almost identical terms is Orat. xx. 6.

   [2629] Atheism.  This term is used of Sabellianism xviii. 16. xx. 6.
   xxi. 13. xliii. 30, in the sense in which it is here explained.  Cf.
   Petav. de Trin. I. vi. 3, sqq.

   [2630] Madness of Arianism, xxi. 13. xxxiv. 8. xliii. 30.  This term is
   applied in a letter of Constantine after the Council of Nicæa.  It is
   called Judaism also Orat. xx. 6 as frequently by S. Athanasius.  Cf.
   Petav. de Trin. I. ix. 8.

   [2631] Piety, eulabeia. i.e. The pious readily and attentively receive
   instruction in morality or generally received truth, but are more
   suspicious and intolerant than ordinary people, if, at a time when any
   theological question is hotly debated, a preacher touches upon any
   point connected with it, and so stirs party feeling or personal
   prejudice.

   [2632] The primary hope.  This term is used of the full knowledge and
   confession of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, Orat. xxxii. 23; where
   its necessary connection with Christianity and the life of the soul is
   insisted on.  For its vital importance cf. Liddon, Bamp. Lect. pp. 435,
   6, and its bearing on the Mediatorial Work of Christ, and so on our
   salvation.  Ibid. Lect. VIII. esp. pp. 472-9 (5th ed.).  S. Cyr. Hier.

   [2641] Our material bodies, lit., "matter."  This, together with

   [2654] Exterior, Origen, Hom. 5, in Levit., speaks of the body, soul,

   [2656] Degrees, etc.  Heb. v. 14 V. "use" (in the singular), the sense

   [2879] A man.  A Greek scholiast says that this was Origen (ob. a.d.
   235), who gives this interpretation in his commentary on the prophecy
   of Jonah.  Elias says that he had read it in the commentary of
   Methodius (fl. a.d. 300), who usually combats Origen's
   interpretations.  We know that Origen did comment on the book of Job,
   and that Methodius wrote on one at least of the Minor Prophets:  but
   both these works have been lost, so that we cannot absolutely decide
   the question, though the assurance with which both the notes are
   written makes us hesitate to consider either of them merely a happy
   guess.  Combefis thinks that S. Greg. alludes to one of his own
   instructors:  the gen. with akouo (cf. Plato, Gorg., 503, c.) favours
   this view, but the interpretation may well have been derived from one
   of the earlier writers.

   [2883] Shall be worked out.  This promise, as Elias tells us, was
   fulfilled by S. Gregory in his History of Ezekiel the Prophet, a work
   no longer extant.

   [2884] Of the Church.  S. Gregory seems to describe a series of three
   steps, (1) the Church, of which all should be worthy members, (2) the
   Sanctuary, reserved for the Priests, (3) the Throne of the Bishop.
   Clémencet refers both 1 and 2 to the ministry.  If we suppose S.
   Gregory's own position to be referred to, the third would be applicable
   to his office under his father, which is held by Thomassin to have been
   that of Vicar-General (Disc. Eccles., I., ii., 7 §§ 2, 3).  A similar
   post was offered to him by S. Basil (Orat., xliii., 39).

   Oration III.

   To Those Who Had Invited Him, and Not Come to Receive Him.

   (About Easter a.d. 362.)

   I.  How slow you are, my friends and brethren, to come to listen to my
   words, though you were so swift in tyrannizing over me, and tearing me
   from my Citadel Solitude, which I had embraced in preference to
   everything else, and as coadjutress and mother of the divine ascent,
   and as deifying man, [2920] I had especially admired, and had set
   before me as the guide of my whole life. [2921]   How is it that, now
   you have got it, you thus despise what you so greatly desired to
   obtain, and seem to be better able to desire the absent than to enjoy
   the present; as though you preferred to possess my teaching rather than
   to profit by it?  Yes, I may even say this to you:  "I became a surfeit
   unto you before you tasted of me, or gave me a trial" [2922] --which is
   most strange.

   II.  And neither did you entertain me as a guest, nor, if I may make a
   remark of a more compassionate kind, did you allow yourselves to be
   entertained by me, reverencing this command if nothing else; nor did
   you take me by the hand, as beginning a new task; nor encourage me in
   my timidity, nor console me for the violence I had suffered; but--I
   shrink from saying it, though say it I must--you made my festival no
   festival, and received me with no happy introduction; and you mingled
   the solemn festival with sorrow, because it lacked that which most of
   all would have contributed to its happiness, the presence of you my
   conquerors, for it would not be true to call you people who love me.
   So easily is anything despised which is easily conquered, and the proud
   receives attention, while he who is humble before God is slighted.

   III.  What will ye?  Shall I be judged by you, or shall I be your
   judge?  Shall I pass a verdict, or receive one, for I hope to be
   acquitted if I be judged, and if I give sentence, to give it against
   you justly?  The charge against you is that you do not answer my love
   with equal measure, nor do you repay my obedience with honour, nor do
   you pledge the future to me by your present alacrity--though even if
   you had, I could hardly have believed it.  But each of you has
   something which he prefers to both the old and the new Pastor, neither
   reverencing the grey hairs of the one, nor calling out the youthful
   spirit of the other.

   IV.  There is a Banquet in the Gospels, [2923] and a hospitable Host
   and friends; and the Banquet is most pleasant, for it is the marriage
   of His Son.  He calleth them, but they come not:  He is angry, and--I
   pass over the interval for fear of bad omen--but, to speak gently, He
   filleth the Banquet with others.  God forbid that this should be your
   case; but yet you have treated me (how shall I put it gently?) with as
   much haughtiness or boldness as they who after being called to a feast
   rise up against it, and insult their host; for you, though you are not
   of the number of those who are without, or are invited to the marriage,
   but are yourselves those who invited me, and bound me to the Holy
   Table, and shewed me the glory of the Bridal Chamber, then deserted me
   (this is the most splendid thing about you)--one to his field, another
   to his newly bought yoke of oxen, another to his just-married wife,
   another to some other trifling matter; you were all scattered and
   dispersed, caring little for the Bridechamber and the Bridegroom.
   [2924]

   V.  On this account I was filled with despondency and perplexity--for I
   will not keep silence about what I have suffered--and I was very near
   withholding the discourse which I was minded to bestow as a
   Marriage-gift, the most beautiful and precious of all I had; and I very
   nearly let it loose upon you, whom, now that the violence had once been
   done to me, I greatly longed for:  for I thought I could get from this
   a splendid theme, and because my love sharpened my tongue--love which
   is very hot and ready for accusation when it is stirred to jealousy by
   grief which it conceives from some unexpected neglect.  If any of you
   has been pierced with love's sting, and has felt himself neglected, he
   knows the feeling, and will pardon one who so suffers, because he
   himself has been near the same frenzy.

   VI.  But it is not permitted to me at the present time to say to you
   anything upbraiding; and God forbid I ever should.  And even now
   perhaps I have reproached you more than in due measure, the Sacred
   Flock, the praise-worthy nurselings of Christ, the Divine inheritance;
   by which, O God, Thou art rich, even wert Thou poor in all other
   respects.  To Thee, I think, are fitting those words, "The lot is
   fallen unto Thee in a fair ground:  yea Thou hast the goodliest
   heritage." [2925]   Nor will I allow that the most populous cities or
   the broadest flocks have any advantage over us, the little ones of the
   smallest of all the tribes of Israel, of the least of the thousands of
   Judah, [2926] of the little Bethlehem among cities, [2927] where Christ
   was born and is from the beginning well-known and worshipped; amongst
   those whom the Father is exalted, and the Son is held to be equal to
   Him, and the Holy Ghost is glorified with Them:  we who are of one
   soul, who mind the same thing, who in nothing injure the Trinity,
   neither by preferring One Person above another, nor by cutting off
   any:  as those bad umpires and measurers of the Godhead do, who by
   magnifying One Person more than is fit, diminish and insult the whole.

   VII.  But do ye also, if you bear me any good will--ye who are my
   husbandry, my vineyard, my own bowels, or rather His Who is our common
   Father, for in Christ he hath begotten you through the Gospels [2928]
   --shew to us also some respect.  It is only fair, since we have
   honoured you above all else:  ye are my witnesses, ye, and they who
   have placed in our hands this--shall I say Authority, or Service?  And
   if to him that loveth most is due, how shall I measure the love, for
   which I have made you my debtors by my own love?  Rather, shew respect
   for yourselves, and the Image committed to your care, [2929] and Him
   Who committed it, and the Sufferings of Christ, and your hopes
   therefrom, holding fast the faith which ye have received, and in which
   ye were brought up, by which also ye are being saved, and trust to save
   others (for not many, be well assured, can boast of what you can), and
   reckoning piety to consist, not in often speaking about God, but in
   silence for the most part, for the tongue is a dangerous thing to men,
   if it be not governed by reason.  Believe that listening is always less
   dangerous than talking, just as learning about God is more pleasant
   than teaching.  Leave the more accurate search into these questions to
   those who are the Stewards of the Word; and for yourselves, worship a
   little in words, but more by your actions, and rather by keeping the
   Law than by admiring the Lawgiver; shew your love for Him by fleeing
   from wickedness, pursuing after virtue, living in the Spirit, walking
   in the Spirit, drawing your knowledge from Him, building upon the
   foundation of the faith, not wood or hay or stubble, [2930] weak
   materials and easily spent when the fire shall try our works or destroy
   them; but gold, silver, precious stones, which remain and stand.

   VIII.  So may ye act, and so may ye honour us, whether present or
   absent, whether taking your part in our sermons, or preferring to do
   something else:  and may ye be the children of God, pure and
   unblamable, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation: [2931]
   and may ye never be entangled in the snares of the wicked that go round
   about, or bound with the chain of your sins.  May the Word in you never
   be smothered with cares of this life and so ye become unfruitful:  but
   may ye walk in the King's Highway, turning aside neither to the right
   hand nor to the left, [2932] but led by the Spirit through the strait
   gate.  Then all our affairs shall prosper, both now and at the inquest
   There, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to Whom be the glory for ever.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2920] S. Gregory very frequently uses this very strong expression to
   bring out the reality and intimacy of the Christian's Union with Christ
   as the result of the sanctifying grace by which all the Baptized are
   made "partakers of the Divine Nature" (2 Pet. i. 4).

   Oration VII.

   Panegyric on His Brother S. Cæsarius.

   The date of this Oration is probably the spring of a.d. 369.  It is
   placed by S. Jerome first among S. Gregory's Orations.  Cæsarius, the
   Saint's younger brother, was born probably about a.d. 330.  Educated in
   his early years at home, he studied later in the schools of Alexandria,
   where he attained great proficiency in mathematics, astronomy, and,
   especially, in medicine.  On his return from Alexandria, he was offered
   by the Emperor Constantius, in response to a public petition, an
   honourable and lucrative post at Byzantium, but was prevailed upon by
   Gregory to return with him to Nazianzus.  After a while he went back to
   Byzantium, and, on the accession of Julian, was pressed to retain his
   appointment at court, and did so, in spite of Gregory's reproaches,
   until Julian, who had long been trying to win him from Christianity, at
   last invited him to a public discussion.  Cæsarius, in spite of the
   specious arguments of the Emperor, gained the day, but, having now
   distinctly declared himself a Christian, could no longer remain at
   court.  On the death of Julian, he was esteemed and promoted by
   successive Emperors, until he received from Valens the office of
   treasurer of Bithynia.  The exact character of this office and its rank
   are still undecided by historical writers, some of whom attribute to
   him other offices not mentioned by S. Gregory, which most probably were
   filled by a namesake.  On the 11th of October a.d. 368 the city of
   Nicæa was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake and Cæsarius
   miraculously escaped with his life.  Impressed by his escape, he
   received Holy Baptism, and formed plans for retiring from office and
   (as it seems) devoting himself to a life of ascetic discipline, which
   were dissipated by his early and sudden death.

   1.  It may be, my friends, my brethren, my fathers (ye who are dear to
   me in reality as well as in name) that you think that I, who am about
   to pay the sad tribute of lamentation to him who has departed, am eager
   to undertake the task, and shall, as most men delight to do, speak at
   great length and in eloquent style.  And so some of you, who have had
   like sorrows to bear, are prepared to join in my mourning and
   lamentation, in order to bewail your own griefs in mine, and learn to
   feel pain at the afflictions of a friend, while others are looking to
   feast their ears in the enjoyment of my words.  For they suppose that I
   must needs make my misfortune an occasion for display--as was once my
   wont, when possessed of a superabundance of earthly things, and
   ambitious, above all, of oratorical renown--before I looked up to Him
   Who is the true and highest Word, and gave all up to God, from Whom all
   things come, and took God for all in all.  Now pray do not think this
   of me, if you wish to think of me aright.  For I am neither going to
   lament for him who is gone more than is good--as I should not approve
   of such conduct even in others--nor am I going to praise him beyond due
   measure.  Albeit that language is a dear and especially proper tribute
   to one gifted with it, and eulogy to one who was exceedingly fond of my
   words--aye, not only a tribute, but a debt, the most just of all
   debts.  But even in my tears and admiration I must respect the law
   which regards such matters:  nor is this alien to our philosophy; for
   he says The memory of the just is accompanied with eulogies, [2933] and
   also, Let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if
   thou hadst suffered great harm thyself: [2934]   removing us equally
   from insensibility and immoderation.  I shall proceed then, not only to
   exhibit the weakness of human nature, but also to put you in mind of
   the dignity of the soul, and, giving such consolation as is due to
   those who are in sorrow, transfer our grief, from that which concerns
   the flesh and temporal things, to those things which are spiritual and
   eternal.

   2.  The parents of Cæsarius, to take first the point which best becomes
   me, are known to you all.  Their excellence you are eager to notice,
   and hear of with admiration, and share in the task of setting it forth
   to any, if there be such, who know it not:  for no single man is able
   to do so entirely, and the task is one beyond the powers of a single
   tongue, however laborious, however zealous.  Among the many and great
   points for which they are to be celebrated (I trust I may not seem
   extravagant in praising my own family) the greatest of all, which more
   than any other stamps their character, is piety.  By their hoar hairs
   they lay claim to reverence, but they are no less venerable for their
   virtue than for their age; for while their bodies are bent beneath the
   burden of their years, their souls renew their youth in God.

   3.  His father [2935] was well grafted out of the wild olive tree into
   the good one, and so far partook of its fatness as to be entrusted with
   the engrafting of others, and charged with the culture of souls,
   presiding in a manner becoming his high office over this people, like a
   second Aaron or Moses, bidden himself to draw near to God, [2936] and
   to convey the Divine Voice to the others who stand afar off; [2937]
   gentle, meek, calm in mien, [2938] fervent in spirit, a fine man in
   external appearance, but richer still in that which is out of sight.
   But why should I describe him whom you know?  For I could not even by
   speaking at great length say as much as he deserves, or as much as each
   of you knows and expects to be said of him.  It is then better to leave
   your own fancy to picture him, than mutilate by my words the object of
   your admiration.

   4.  His mother [2939] was consecrated to God by virtue of her descent
   from a saintly family, and was possessed of piety as a necessary
   inheritance, not only for herself, but also for her children--being
   indeed a holy lump from a holy firstfruits. [2940]   And this she so
   far increased and amplified that some, (bold though the statement be, I
   will utter it,) have both believed and said that even her husband's
   perfection has been the work of none other than herself; and, oh how
   wonderful! she herself, as the reward of her piety, has received a
   greater and more perfect piety.  Lovers of their children and of Christ
   as they both were, what is most extraordinary, they were far greater
   lovers of Christ than of their children:  yea, even their one enjoyment
   of their children was that they should be acknowledged and named by
   Christ, and their one measure of their blessedness in their children
   was their virtue and close association with the Chief Good. [2941]
   Compassionate, sympathetic, snatching many a treasure from moths and
   robbers, [2942] and from the prince of this world, [2943] to transfer
   it from their sojourn here to the [true] habitation, laying up in store
   [2944] for their children the heavenly splendour as their greatest
   inheritance.  Thus have they reached a fair old age, equally reverend
   both for virtue and for years, and full of days, alike of those which
   abide and those which pass away; each one failing to secure the first
   prize here below only so far as equalled by the other; yea, they have
   fulfilled the measure of every happiness with the exception of this
   last trial, or discipline, whichever anyone may think we ought to call
   it; I mean their having to send before them the child who was, owing to
   his age, in greater danger of falling, and so to close their life in
   safety, and be translated with all their family to the realms above.

   5.  I have entered into these details, not from a desire to eulogize
   them, for this, I know well, it would be difficult worthily to do, if I
   made their praise the subject of my whole oration, but to set forth the
   excellence inherited from his parents by Cæsarius, and so prevent you
   from being surprised or incredulous, that one sprung from such
   progenitors, should have deserved such praises himself; nay, strange
   indeed would it have been, had he looked to others and disregarded the
   examples of his kinsfolk at home.  His early life was such as becomes
   those really well born and destined for a good life.  I say little of
   his qualities evident to all, his beauty, his stature, his manifold
   gracefulness, and harmonious disposition, as shown in the tones of his
   voice--for it is not my office to laud qualities of this kind, however
   important they may seem to others--and proceed with what I have to say
   of the points which, even if I wished, I could with difficulty pass by.

   6.  Bred and reared under such influences, we were fully trained in the
   education afforded here, [2945] in which none could say how far he
   excelled most of us from the quickness and extent of his abilities--and
   how can I recall those days without my tears showing that, contrary to
   my promises, my feelings have overcome my philosophic restraint?  The
   time came when it was decided that we should leave home, and then for
   the first time we were separated, for I studied rhetoric in the then
   flourishing schools of Palestine; he went to Alexandria, esteemed both
   then and now the home of every branch of learning.  Which of his
   qualities shall I place first and foremost, or which can I omit with
   least injury to my description?  Who was more faithful to his teacher
   than he?  Who more kindly to his classmates?  Who more carefully
   avoided the society and companionship of the depraved?  Who attached
   himself more closely to that of the most excellent, and among others,
   of the most esteemed and illustrious of his countrymen?  For he knew
   that we are strongly influenced to virtue or vice by our companions.
   And in consequence of all this, who was more honoured by the
   authorities than he, and whom did the whole city (though [2946] all
   individuals are concealed in it, because of its size), esteem more
   highly for his discretion, or deem more illustrious for his
   intelligence?

   7.  What branch of learning did he not master, or rather, in what
   branch of study did he not surpass those who had made it their sole
   study?  Whom did he allow even to approach him, not only of his own
   time and age, but even of his elders, who had devoted many more years
   to study?  All subjects he studied as one, and each as thoroughly as if
   he knew no other.  The brilliant in intellect, he surpassed in
   industry, the devoted students in quickness of perception; nay, rather
   he outstripped in rapidity those who were rapid, in application those
   who were laborious, and in both respects those who were distinguished
   in both.  From geometry and astronomy, that science so dangerous [2947]
   to anyone else, he gathered all that was helpful (I mean that he was
   led by the harmony and order of the heavenly bodies to reverence their
   Maker), and avoided what is injurious; not attributing all things that
   are or happen to the influence of the stars, like those who raise their
   own fellow-servant, the creation, in rebellion against the Creator, but
   referring, as is reasonable, the motion of these bodies, and all other
   things besides, to God.  In arithmetic and mathematics, and in the
   wonderful art of medicine, in so far as it treats of physiology and
   temperament, and the causes of disease, in order to remove the roots
   and so destroy their offspring with them, who is there so ignorant or
   contentious as to think him inferior to himself, and not to be glad to
   be reckoned next to him, and carry off the second prize?  This indeed
   is no unsupported assertion, but East and West [2948] alike, and every
   place which he afterward visited, are as pillars inscribed with the
   record of his learning.

   8.  But when, after gathering into his single soul every kind of
   excellence and knowledge, as a mighty merchantman gathers every sort of
   ware, he was voyaging to his own city, in order to communicate to
   others the fair cargo of his culture, there befell a wondrous thing,
   which I must, as its mention is most cheering to me and may delight
   you, briefly set forth.  Our mother, [2949] in her motherly love for
   her children, had offered up a prayer that, as she had sent us forth
   together, she might see us together return home.  For we seemed, to our
   mother at least, if not to others, to form a pair worthy of her prayers
   and glances, if seen together, though now, alas, our connection has
   been severed.  And God, Who hears a righteous prayer, and honours the
   love of parents for well-disposed children, so ordered that, without
   any design or agreement on our part, the one from Alexandria, the other
   from Greece, the one by sea, the other by land, we arrived at the same
   city at the same time.  This city was Byzantium, which now presides
   over Europe, in which Cæsarius, after the lapse of a short time, gained
   such a repute, that public honours, an alliance with an illustrious
   family, and a seat in the council of state were offered him; and a
   mission was despatched to the Emperor by public decision, to beg that
   the first of cities be adorned and honoured by the first of scholars
   (if he cared at all for its being indeed the first, and worthy of its
   name); and that to all its other titles to distinction this further one
   be added, that it was embellished by having Cæsarius as its physician
   and its inhabitant, although its brilliancy was already assured by its
   throngs of great men both in philosophy and other branches of
   learning.  But enough of this.  At this time there happened what seemed
   to others a chance without reason or cause, such as frequently occurs
   of its own accord in our day, but was more than sufficiently manifest
   to devout minds as the result of the prayers to god-fearing parents,
   which were answered by the united arrival of their sons by land and
   sea.

   9.  Well, among the noble traits of Cæsarius' character, we must not
   fail to note one, which perhaps is in others' eyes slight and unworthy
   of mention, but seemed to me, both at the time and since, of the
   highest import, if indeed brotherly love be a praiseworthy quality; nor
   shall I ever cease to place it in the first rank, in relating the story
   of his life.  Although the metropolis strove to retain him by the
   honours I have mentioned, and declared that it would under no
   circumstances let him go, my influence, which he valued most highly on
   all occasions, prevailed upon him to listen to the prayer of his
   parents, to supply his country's need, and to grant me my own desire.
   And when he thus returned home in my company, he preferred me not only
   to cities and peoples, not only to honours and revenues, which had in
   part already flowed to him in abundance from many sources and in part
   were within his reach, but even to the Emperor himself and his imperial
   commands.  From this time, then, having shaken off all ambition, as a
   hard master and a painful disorder, I resolved to practise philosophy
   and adapt myself to the higher life:  or rather the desire was earlier
   born, the life came later.  But my brother, who had dedicated to his
   country the firstfruits of his learning, and gained an admiration
   worthy of his efforts, was afterwards led by the desire of fame, and,
   as he persuaded me, of being the guardian of the city, to betake
   himself to court, not indeed according to my own wishes or judgment;
   for I will confess to you that I think it a better and grander thing to
   be in the lowest rank with God than to win the first place with an
   earthly king.  Nevertheless I cannot blame him, for inasmuch as
   philosophy is the greatest, so is it the most difficult, of
   professions, which can be taken in hand by but few, and only by those
   who have been called forth by the Divine magnanimity, which gives its
   hand to those who are honoured by its preference.  Yet it is no small
   thing if one, who has chosen the lower form of life, follows after
   goodness, and sets greater store on God and his own salvation than on
   earthly lustre; using it as a stage, or a manifold ephemeral mask while
   playing in the drama of this world, but himself living unto God with
   that image which he knows that he has received from Him, and must
   render to Him Who gave it.  That this was certainly the purpose of
   Cæsarius, we know full well.

   10.  Among physicians he gained the foremost place with no great
   trouble, by merely exhibiting his capacity, or rather some slight
   specimen of his capacity, and was forthwith numbered among the friends
   of the Emperor, and enjoyed the highest honours.  But he placed the
   humane functions of his art at the disposal of the authorities free of
   cost, knowing that nothing leads to further advancement than virtue and
   renown for honourable deeds; so that he far surpassed in fame those to
   whom he was inferior in rank.  By his modesty he so won the love of all
   that they entrusted their precious charges to his care, without
   requiring him to be sworn by Hippocrates, since the simplicity of
   Crates was nothing to his own:  winning in general a respect beyond his
   rank; for besides the present repute he was ever thought to have justly
   won, a still greater one was anticipated for him, both by the Emperors
   [2950] themselves and by all who occupied the nearest positions to
   them.  But, most important, neither by his fame, nor by the luxury
   which surrounded him, was his nobility of soul corrupted; for amidst
   his many claims to honour, he himself cared most for being, and being
   known to be, a Christian, and, compared with this, all other things
   were to him but trifling toys.  For they belong to the part we play
   before others on a stage which is very quickly set up and taken down
   again--perhaps indeed more quickly destroyed than put together, as we
   may see from the manifold changes of life, and fluctuations of
   prosperity; while the only real and securely abiding good thing is
   godliness.

   11.  Such was the philosophy of Cæsarius, even at court:  these were
   the ideas amidst which he lived and died, discovering and presenting to
   God, in the hidden man, a still deeper godliness than was publicly
   visible.  And if I must pass by all else, his protection of his kinsmen
   in distress, his contempt for arrogance, his freedom from assumption
   towards friends, his boldness towards men in power, the numerous
   contests and arguments in which he engaged with many on behalf of the
   truth, not merely for the sake of argument, but with deep piety and
   fervour, I must speak of one point at least as especially worthy of
   note.  The Emperor [2951] of unhappy memory was raging against us,
   whose madness in rejecting Christ, after making himself its first
   victim, had now rendered him intolerable to others; though he did not,
   like other fighters against Christ, grandly enlist himself on the side
   of impiety, but veiled his persecution under the form of equity; and,
   ruled by the crooked serpent which possessed his soul, dragged down
   into his own pit his wretched victims by manifold devices.  His first
   artifice and contrivance was, to deprive us of the honour of our
   conflicts (for, noble man as he was, he grudged this to Christians), by
   causing us, who suffered for being Christians, to be punished as evil
   doers:  the second was, to call this process persuasion, and not
   tyranny, so that the disgrace of those who chose to side with impiety
   might be greater than their danger.  Some he won over by money, some by
   dignities, some by promises, some by various honours, which he
   bestowed, not royally but in right servile style, in the sight of all,
   while everyone was influenced by the witchery of his words, and his own
   example.  At last he assailed Cæsarius.  How utter was the derangement
   and folly which could hope to take for his prey a man like Cæsarius, my
   brother, the son of parents like ours!

   12.  However, that I may dwell awhile upon this point, and luxuriate in
   my story as men do who are eyewitnesses in some marvellous event,
   [2952] that noble man, fortified with the sign of Christ, and defending
   himself with His Mighty Word, entered the lists against an adversary
   experienced in arms and strong in his skill in argument.  In no wise
   abashed at the sight, nor shrinking at all from his high purpose
   through flattery, he was an athlete ready, both in word and deed, to
   meet a rival of equal power.  Such then was the arena, and so equipped
   the champion of godliness.  The judge on one side was Christ, arming
   the athlete with His own sufferings:  and on the other a dreadful
   tyrant, [2953] persuasive by his skill in argument, and overawing him
   by the weight of his authority; and as spectators, on either hand, both
   those who were still left on the side of godliness and those who had
   been snatched away by him, watching whether victory inclined to their
   own side or to the other, and more anxious as to which would gain the
   day than the combatants themselves.

   13.  Didst thou not fear for Cæsarius, lest aught unworthy of his zeal
   should befall him?  Nay, be ye of good courage.  For the victory is
   with Christ, Who overcame the world. [2954]   Now for my part, be well
   assured, I should be highly interested in setting forth the details of
   the arguments and allegations used on that occasion, for indeed the
   discussion contains certain feats and elegances, which I dwell on with
   no slight pleasure; but this would be quite foreign to an occasion and
   discourse like the present.  And when, after having torn to shreds all
   his opponent's sophistries, and thrust aside as mere child's play every
   assault, veiled or open, Cæsarius in a loud clear voice declared that
   he was and remained a Christian--not even thus was he finally
   dismissed.  For indeed, the Emperor was possessed by an eager desire to
   enjoy and be distinguished by his culture, and then uttered in the
   hearing of all his famous saying--O happy father, O unhappy sons! thus
   deigning to honour me, whose culture and godliness [2955] he had known
   at Athens, with a share in the dishonour of Cæsarius, who was remanded
   for a further trial [2956] (since Justice was fitly arming the Emperor
   against the Persians), [2957] and welcomed by us after his happy escape
   and bloodless victory, as more illustrious for his dishonour than for
   his celebrity.

   14.  This victory I esteem far more sublime and honourable than the
   Emperor's mighty power and splendid purple and costly diadem.  I am
   more elated in describing it than if he had won from him the half of
   his Empire.  During the evil days he lived in retirement, obedient
   herein to our Christian law, [2958] which bids us, when occasion
   offers, to make ventures on behalf of the truth, and not be traitors to
   our religion from cowardice; yet refrain, as long as may be, from
   rushing into danger, either in fear for our own souls, or to spare
   those who bring the danger upon us.  But when the gloom had been
   dispersed, and the righteous sentence had been pronounced in a foreign
   land, and the glittering sword had struck down the ungodly, and power
   had returned to the hands of Christians, what boots it to say with what
   glory and honour, with how many and great testimonies, as if bestowing
   rather than receiving a favour, he was welcomed again at the Court; his
   new honour succeeding to that of former days; while time changed its
   Emperors, the repute and commanding influence of Cæsarius with them was
   undisturbed, nay, they vied with each other in striving to attach him
   most closely to themselves, and be known as his special friends and
   acquaintances.  Such was the godliness of Cæsarius, such its results.
   Let all men, young and old, give ear, and press on through the same
   virtue to the same distinction, for glorious is the fruit of good
   labours, [2959] if they suppose this to be worth striving after, and a
   part of true happiness.

   15.  Again another wonder concerning him is a strong argument for his
   parents' piety and his own.  He was living in Bithynia, holding an
   office of no small importance from the Emperor, viz., the stewardship
   of his revenue, and care of the exchequer:  for this had been assigned
   to him by the Emperor as a prelude to the highest offices.  And when, a
   short time ago, the earthquake [2960] in Nicæa occurred, which is said
   to have been the most serious within the memory of man, overwhelming in
   a common destruction almost all the inhabitants and the beauty of the
   city, he alone, or with very few of the men of rank, survived the
   danger, being shielded by the very falling ruins in his incredible
   escape, and bearing slight traces of the peril; yet he allowed fear to
   lead him to a more important salvation, for he dedicated himself
   entirely to the Supreme Providence; he renounced the service of
   transitory things, and attached himself to another court.  This he both
   purposed himself, and made the object of the united earnest prayers to
   which he invited me by letter, when I seized this opportunity to give
   him warning, [2961] as I never ceased to do when pained that his great
   nature should be occupied in affairs beneath it, and that a soul so
   fitted for philosophy should, like the sun behind a cloud, be obscured
   amid the whirl of public life.  Unscathed though he had been by the
   earthquake, he was not proof against disease, since he was but human.
   His escape was peculiar to himself; his death common to all mankind;
   the one the token of his piety, the other the result of his nature.
   The former, for our consolation, preceded his fate, so that, though
   shaken by his death, we might exult in the extraordinary character of
   his preservation.  And now our illustrious Cæsarius has been restored
   to us, when his honoured dust and celebrated corse, after being
   escorted home amidst a succession of hymns and public orations, has
   been honoured by the holy hands of his parents; while his mother,
   substituting the festal garments of religion for the trappings of woe,
   has overcome her tears by her philosophy, and lulled to sleep
   lamentations by psalmody, as her son enjoys honours worthy of his newly
   regenerate soul, which has been, through water, transformed by the
   Spirit.

   16.  This, Cæsarius, is my funeral offering to thee, this the
   firstfruits of my words, which thou hast often blamed me for
   withholding, yet wouldst have stripped off, had they been bestowed on
   thee; with this ornament I adorn thee, an ornament, I know well, far
   dearer to thee than all others, though it be not of the soft flowing
   tissues of silk, in which while living, with virtue for thy sole
   adorning, thou didst not, like the many, rejoice; nor texture of
   transparent linen, nor outpouring of costly unguents, which thou hadst
   long resigned to the boudoirs of the fair, with their sweet savours
   lasting but a single day; nor any other small thing valued by small
   minds, which would have all been hidden to-day with thy fair form by
   this bitter stone.  Far hence be games and stories of the Greeks, the
   honours of ill-fated youths, with their petty prizes for petty
   contests; and all the libations and firstfruits or garlands and newly
   plucked flowers, wherewith men honour the departed, in obedience to
   ancient custom and unreasoning grief, rather than reason.  My gift is
   an oration, which perhaps succeeding time will receive at my hand and
   ever keep in motion, that it may not suffer him who has left us to be
   utterly lost to earth, but may ever keep him whom we honour in men's
   ears and minds, as it sets before them, more clearly than a portrait,
   the image of him for whom we mourn.

   17.  Such is my offering; if it be slight and inferior to his merit,
   God loveth that which is according to our power. [2962]   Part of our
   gift is now complete, the remainder we will now pay by offering (those
   of us who still survive) every year our honours and memorials.  And now
   for thee, sacred and holy soul, we pray for an entrance into heaven;
   mayest thou enjoy such repose as the bosom of Abraham affords, mayest
   thou behold the choir of Angels, and the glories and splendours of
   sainted men; aye, mayest thou be united to that choir and share in
   their joy, looking down from on high on all things here, on what men
   call wealth, and despicable dignities, and deceitful honours, and the
   errors of our senses, and the tangle of this life, and its confusion
   and ignorance, as if we were fighting in the dark; whilst thou art in
   attendance upon the Great King and filled with the light which streams
   forth from Him:  and may it be ours hereafter, receiving therefrom no
   such slender rivulet, as is the object of our fancy in this day of
   mirrors and enigmas, to attain to the fount of good itself, gazing with
   pure mind upon the truth in its purity, and finding a reward for our
   eager toil here below on behalf of the good, in our more perfect
   possession and vision of the good on high:  the end to which our sacred
   books and teachers foretell that our course of divine mysteries shall
   lead us.

   18.  What now remains?  To bring the healing of the Word to those in
   sorrow.  And a powerful remedy for mourners is sympathy, for sufferers
   are best consoled by those who have to bear a like suffering.  To such,
   then, I specially address myself, of whom I should be ashamed, if, with
   all other virtues, they do not show the elements of patience.  For even
   if they surpass all others in love of their children, let them equally
   surpass them in love of wisdom and love of Christ, and in the special
   practice of meditation on our departure hence, impressing it likewise
   on their children, making even their whole life a preparation for
   death.  But if your misfortune still clouds your reason and, like the
   moisture which dims our eyes, hides from you the clear view of your
   duty, come, ye elders, receive the consolation of a young man, ye
   fathers, that of a child, who ought to be admonished by men as old as
   you, who have admonished many and gathered experience from your many
   years.  Yet wonder not, if in my youth I admonish the aged; and if in
   aught I can see better than the hoary, I offer it to you.  How much
   longer have we to live, ye men of honoured eld, so near to God?  How
   long are we to suffer here?  Not even man's whole life is long,
   compared with the Eternity of the Divine Nature, still less the remains
   of life, and what I may call the parting of our human breath, the close
   of our frail existence.  How much has Cæsarius outstripped us?  How
   long shall we be left to mourn his departure?  Are we not hastening to
   the same abode?  Shall we not soon be covered by the same stone?  Shall
   we not shortly be reduced to the same dust?  And what in these short
   days will be our gain, save that after it has been ours to see, or
   suffer, or perchance even to do, more ill, we must discharge the common
   and inexorable tribute to the law of nature, by following some,
   preceding others, to the tomb, mourning these, being lamented by those,
   and receiving from some that meed of tears which we ourselves had paid
   to others?

   19.  Such, my brethren, is our existence, who live this transient life,
   such our pastime upon earth:  we come into existence out of
   non-existence, and after existing are dissolved.  We are unsubstantial
   dreams, impalpable visions, [2963] like the flight of a passing bird,
   like a ship leaving no track upon the sea, [2964] a speck of dust, a
   vapour, an early dew, a flower that quickly blooms, and quickly fades.
   As for man his days are as grass, as a flower of the field, so he
   flourisheth. [2965]   Well hath inspired David discoursed of our
   frailty, and again in these words, "Let me know the shortness of my
   days;" and he defines the days of man as "of a span long." [2966]   And
   what wouldst thou say to Jeremiah, who complains of his mother in
   sorrow for his birth, [2967] and that on account of others' faults?  I
   have seen all things, [2968] says the preacher, I have reviewed in
   thought all human things, wealth, pleasure, power, unstable glory,
   wisdom which evades us rather than is won; then pleasure again, wisdom
   again, often revolving the same objects, the pleasures of appetite,
   orchards, numbers of slaves, store of wealth, serving men and serving
   maids, singing men and singing women, arms, spearmen, subject nations,
   collected tributes, the pride of kings, all the necessaries and
   superfluities of life, in which I surpassed all the kings that were
   before me.  And what does he say after all these things?  Vanity of
   vanities, [2969] all is vanity and vexation of spirit, possibly meaning
   some unreasoning longing of the soul, and distraction of man condemned
   to this from the original fall:  but hear, he says, the conclusion of
   the whole matter, Fear God. [2970]   This is his stay in his
   perplexity, and this is thy only gain from life here below, to be
   guided through the disorder of the things which are seen [2971] and
   shaken, to the things which stand firm and are not moved. [2972]

   20.  Let us not then mourn Cæsarius but ourselves, knowing what evils
   he has escaped to which we are left behind, and what treasure we shall
   lay up, unless, earnestly cleaving unto God and outstripping transitory
   things, we press towards the life above, deserting the earth while we
   are still upon the earth, and earnestly following the spirit which
   bears us upward.  Painful as this is to the faint-hearted, it is as
   nothing to men of brave mind.  And let us consider it thus.  Cæsarius
   will not reign, but rather will he be reigned over by others.  He will
   strike terror into no one, but he will be free from fear of any harsh
   master, often himself unworthy even of a subject's position.  He will
   not amass wealth, but neither will he be liable to envy, or be pained
   at lack of success, or be ever seeking to add to his gains as much
   again.  For such is the disease of wealth, which knows no limit to its
   desire of more, and continues to make drinking the medicine for
   thirst.  He will make no display of his power of speaking, yet for his
   speaking will he be admired.  He will not discourse upon the dicta of
   Hippocrates and Galen, and their adversaries, but neither will he be
   troubled by diseases, and suffer pain at the misfortunes of others.  He
   will not set forth the principles of Eucleides, Ptolemæus, and Heron,
   but neither will he be pained by the tumid vaunts of uncultured men.
   He will make no display of the doctrines of Plato, and Aristotle, and
   Pyrrho, and the names of any Democritus, and Heracleitus, Anaxagoras,
   Cleanthes and Epicurus, and all the members of the venerable Porch and
   Academy:  but neither will he trouble himself with the solution of
   their cunning syllogisms.  What need of further details?  Yet here are
   some which all men honour or desire.  Nor wife nor child will he have
   beside him, but he will escape mourning for, or being mourned by them,
   or leaving them to others, or being left behind himself as a memorial
   of misfortune.  He will inherit no property:  but he will have such
   heirs [2973] as are of the greatest service, such as he himself wished,
   so that he departed hence a rich man, bearing with him all that was
   his.  What an ambition!  What a new consolation!  What magnanimity in
   his executors!  A proclamation has been heard, worthy of the ears of
   all, and a mother's grief has been made void by a fair and holy
   promise, to give entirely to her son his wealth as a funeral offering
   on his behalf, leaving nothing to those who expected it.

   21.  Is this inadequate for our consolation?  I will add a more potent
   remedy.  I believe the words of the wise, that every fair and
   God-beloved soul, when, set free from the bonds of the body, it departs
   hence, at once enjoys a sense and perception of the blessings which
   await it, inasmuch as that which darkened it has been purged away, or
   laid aside--I know not how else to term it--and feels a wondrous
   pleasure and exultation, and goes rejoicing to meet its Lord, having
   escaped as it were from the grievous poison of life here, and shaken
   off the fetters which bound it and held down the wings of the mind, and
   so enters on the enjoyment of the bliss laid up for it, of which it has
   even now some conception.  Then, a little later, it receives its
   kindred flesh, which once shared in its pursuits of things above, from
   the earth which both gave and had been entrusted with it, and in some
   way known to God, who knit them together and dissolved them, enters
   with it upon the inheritance of the glory there.  And, as it shared,
   through their close union, in its hardships, so also it bestows upon it
   a portion of its joys, gathering it up entirely into itself, and
   becoming with it one in spirit and in mind and in God, the mortal and
   mutable being swallowed up of life.  Hear at least how the inspired
   Ezekiel discourses of the knitting together of bones and sinews, [2974]
   how after him Saint Paul speaks of the earthly tabernacle, and the
   house not made with hands, the one to be dissolved, the other laid up
   in heaven, alleging absence from the body to be presence with the Lord,
   [2975] and bewailing his life in it as an exile, and therefore longing
   for and hastening to his release.  Why am I faint-hearted in my hopes?
   Why behave like a mere creature of a day?  I await the voice of the
   Archangel, [2976] the last trumpet, [2977] the transformation of the
   heavens, the transfiguration of the earth, the liberation of the
   elements, the renovation of the universe. [2978]   Then shall I see
   Cæsarius himself, no longer in exile, no longer laid upon a bier, no
   longer the object of mourning and pity, but brilliant, glorious,
   heavenly, such as in my dreams I have often beheld thee, dearest and
   most loving of brothers, pictured thus by my desire, if not by the very
   truth.

   22.  But now, laying aside lamentation, I will look at myself, and
   examine my feelings, that I may not unconsciously have in myself
   anything to be lamented.  O ye sons of men, for the words apply to you,
   how long will ye be hard-hearted and gross in mind?  Why do ye love
   vanity and seek after leasing, [2979] supposing life here to be a great
   thing and these few days many, and shrinking from this separation,
   welcome and pleasant as it is, as if it were really grievous and
   awful?  Are we not to know ourselves?  Are we not to cast away visible
   things?  Are we not to look to the things unseen?  Are we not, even if
   we are somewhat grieved, to be on the contrary distressed at our
   lengthened sojourn, [2980] like holy David, who calls things here the
   tents of darkness, and the place of affliction, and the deep mire,
   [2981] and the shadow of death; [2982] because we linger in the tombs
   we bear about with us, because, though we are gods, we die like men
   [2983] the death of sin?  This is my fear, this day and night
   accompanies me, and will not let me breathe, on one side the glory, on
   the other the place of correction:  the former I long for till I can
   say, "My soul fainteth for Thy salvation;" [2984] from the latter I
   shrink back shuddering; yet I am not afraid that this body of mine
   should utterly perish in dissolution and corruption; but that the
   glorious creature of God (for glorious it is if upright, just as it is
   dishonourable if sinful) in which is reason, morality, and hope, should
   be condemned to the same dishonour as the brutes, and be no better
   after death; a fate to be desired for the wicked, who are worthy of the
   fire yonder.

   23.  Would that I might mortify my members that are upon the earth,
   [2985] would that I might spend my all upon the spirit, walking in the
   way that is narrow and trodden by few, not that which is broad and
   easy. [2986]   For glorious and great are its consequences, and our
   hope is greater than our desert.  What is man, that Thou art mindful of
   him? [2987]   What is this new mystery which concerns me?  I am small
   and great, lowly and exalted, mortal and immortal, earthly and
   heavenly.  I share one condition with the lower world, the other with
   God; one with the flesh, the other with the spirit.  I must be buried
   with Christ, arise with Christ, be joint heir with Christ, become the
   son of God, yea, God Himself.  See whither our argument has carried us
   in its progress.  I almost own myself indebted to the disaster which
   has inspired me with such thoughts, and made me more enamoured of my
   departure hence.  This is the purpose of the great mystery for us.
   This is the purpose for us of God, Who for us was made man and became
   poor, [2988] to raise our flesh, [2989] and recover His image, [2990]
   and remodel man, [2991] that we might all be made one in Christ, [2992]
   who was perfectly made in all of us all that He Himself is, [2993] that
   we might no longer be male and female, barbarian, Scythian, bond or
   free [2994] (which are badges of the flesh), but might bear in
   ourselves only the stamp of God, by Whom and for Whom we were made,
   [2995] and have so far received our form and model from Him, that we
   are recognized by it alone.

   24.  Yea, would that what we hope for might be, according to the great
   kindness of our bountiful God, Who asks for little and bestows great
   things, both in the present and in the future, upon those who truly
   love Him; [2996] bearing all things, enduring all things [2997] for
   their love and hope of Him, giving thanks for all things [2998]
   favourable and unfavourable alike:  I mean pleasant and painful, for
   reason knows that even these are often instruments of salvation;
   commending to Him our own souls [2999] and the souls of those fellow
   wayfarers who, being more ready, have gained their rest before us.
   And, now that we have done this, let us cease from our discourse, and
   you too from your tears, hastening, as you now are, to your tomb, which
   as a sad abiding gift you have given to Cæsarius, seasonably prepared
   as it was for his parents in their old age, and now unexpectedly
   bestowed on their son in his youth, though not without reason in His
   eyes Who disposes our affairs.  O Lord and Maker of all things, and
   specially of this our frame!  O God and Father and Pilot of men who are
   Thine!  O Lord of life and death!  O Judge and Benefactor of our
   souls!  O Maker and Transformer in due time of all things [3000] by Thy
   designing Word, [3001] according to the knowledge of the depth of Thy
   wisdom and providence! do Thou now receive Cæsarius, the firstfruits of
   our pilgrimage; and if he who was last is first, we bow before Thy
   Word, by which the universe is ruled; yet do Thou receive us also
   afterwards, in a time when Thou mayest be found, [3002] having ordered
   us in the flesh as long as is for our profit; yea, receive us, prepared
   and not troubled [3003] by Thy fear, not departing from Thee in our
   last day, nor violently borne away from things here, like souls fond of
   the world and the flesh, but filled with eagerness for that blessed and
   enduring life which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord, to whom be glory,
   world without end.  Amen.

   Oration VIII.

   On his Sister Gorgonia.

   The exact date of this Oration is uncertain.  It is certainly (§23)
   later than the death of Cæsarius, a.d. 369, and previous to the death
   of their father, a.d. 374.  So much we gather from the Oration itself,
   and the references made by some authors to a poem of S. Gregory do not
   add anything certain to our knowledge (Poem. Hist. I. 1. v.v. 108,
   227).  The place in which it was delivered is, almost without doubt,
   the city in which her married life had been spent.  The public details
   of that life are familiar to the audience.  Gorgonia's parents, and the
   speaker himself, although known to them, are not spoken of in terms
   implying intimacy such as we find in Orations known to have been
   delivered at Nazianzus.  The spiritual father and confidant of Gorgonia
   is present, certainly in a position of authority, probably seated in
   the Episcopal throne.  The husband of Gorgonia (Epitaph. 24) was named
   Alypius.  His home, as Clémencet and Benoît agree, on the authority of
   Elias, was at Iconium, of which city, at the time, Faustinus was
   bishop.  The names of Gorgonia's two sons are unknown.  Elias states
   that they both became bishops.  S. Gregory mentions her three
   daughters, Alypiana, Eugenia, and Nonna, in his will.  The oration is
   marked by an eloquence, piety, and tender feeling which make it a
   worthy companion of that on Cæsarius.

   Funeral Oration on his Sister Gorgonia.

   1.  In praising my sister, I shall pay honour to one of my own family;
   yet my praise will not be false, because it is given to a relation,
   but, because it is true, will be worthy of commendation, and its truth
   is based not only upon its justice, but upon well-known facts.  For,
   even if I wished, I should not be permitted to be partial; since
   everyone who hears me stands, like a skilful critic, between my oration
   and the truth, to discountenance exaggeration, yet, if he be a man of
   justice, demanding what is really due.  So that my fear is not of
   outrunning the truth, but, on the contrary, of falling short of it, and
   lessening her just repute by the extreme inadequacy of my panegyric;
   for it is a hard task to match her excellences with suitable action and
   words.  Let us not then be so unjust as to praise every characteristic
   of other folk, and disparage really valuable qualities because they are
   our own, so as to make some men gain by their absence of kindred with
   us, while others suffer for their relationship.  For justice would be
   violated alike by the praise of the one and the neglect of the other,
   whereas if we make the truth our standard and rule, and look to her
   alone, disregarding all the objects of the vulgar and the mean, we
   shall praise or pass over everything according to its merits.

   2.  Yet it would be most unreasonable of all, if, while we refuse to
   regard it as a righteous thing to defraud, insult, accuse, or treat
   unjustly in any way, great or small, those who are our kindred, and
   consider wrong done to those nearest to us the worst of all; we were
   yet to imagine that it would be an act of justice to deprive them of
   such an oration as is due most of all to the good, and spend more words
   upon those who are evil, and beg for indulgent treatment, than on those
   who are excellent and merely claim their due.  For if we are not
   prevented, as would be far more just, from praising men who have lived
   outside our own circle, because we do not know and cannot personally
   testify to their merits, shall we be prevented from praising those whom
   we do know, because of our friendship, or the envy of the multitude,
   and especially those who have departed hence, whom it is too late to
   ingratiate ourselves with, since they have escaped, amongst all other
   things, from the reach of praise or blame.

   3.  Having now made a sufficient defence on these points, and shown how
   necessary it is for me to be the speaker, come, let me proceed with my
   eulogy, rejecting all daintiness and elegance of style (for she whom we
   are praising was unadorned and the absence of ornament was to her,
   beauty), and yet performing, as a most indispensable debt, all those
   funeral rites which are her due, and further instructing everyone in a
   zealous imitation of the same virtue, since it is my object in every
   word and action to promote the perfection of those committed to my
   charge.  The task of praising the country and family of our departed
   one I leave to another, more scrupulous in adhering to the rules of
   eulogy; nor will he lack many fair topics, if he wish to deck her with
   external ornaments, as men deck a splendid and beautiful form with gold
   and precious stones, and the artistic devices of the craftsman; which,
   while they accentuate ugliness by their contrast, can add no
   attractiveness to the beauty which surpasses them.  For my part, I will
   only conform to such rules so far as to allude to our common parents,
   for it would not be reverent to pass unnoticed the great blessing of
   having such parents and teachers, and then speedily direct my attention
   to herself, without further taxing the patience of those who are eager
   to learn what manner of woman she was.

   4.  Who is there who knows not the Abraham and Sarah of these our
   latter days, Gregory and Nonna his wife?  For it is not well to omit
   the incitement to virtue of mentioning their names.  He has been
   justified by faith, she has dwelt with him who is faithful; he beyond
   all hope has been the father of many nations, [3004] she has
   spiritually travailed in their birth; he escaped from the bondage of
   his father's gods, [3005] she is the daughter as well as the mother of
   the free; he went out from kindred and home for the sake of the land of
   promise, [3006] she was the occasion of his exile; for on this head
   alone I venture to claim for her an honour higher than that of Sarah;
   he set forth on so noble a pilgrimage, she readily shared with him in
   its toils; he gave himself to the Lord, she both called her husband
   lord and regarded him as such, and in part was thereby justified; whose
   was the promise, from whom, as far as in them lay, was born Isaac, and
   whose was the gift.

   5.  This good shepherd was the result of his wife's prayers and
   guidance, and it was from her that he learned his ideal of a good
   shepherd's life.  He generously fled from his idols, and afterwards
   even put demons to flight; he never consented to eat salt with
   idolators:  united together with a bond of one honour, of one mind, of
   one soul, concerned as much with virtue and fellowship with God as with
   the flesh; equal in length of life and hoary hairs, equal in prudence
   and brilliancy, rivals of each other, soaring beyond all the rest,
   possessed in few respects by the flesh, and translated in spirit, even
   before dissolution:  possessing not the world, and yet possessing it,
   by at once despising and rightly valuing it:  forsaking riches and yet
   being rich through their noble pursuits; rejecting things here, and
   purchasing instead the things yonder:  possessed of a scanty remnant of
   this life, left over from their piety, but of an abundant and long life
   for which they have laboured. I will say but one word more about them:
   they have been rightly and fairly assigned, each to either sex; he is
   the ornament of men, she of women, and not only the ornament but the
   pattern of virtue.

   6.  From them Gorgonia derived both her existence and her reputation;
   they sowed in her the seeds of piety, they were the source of her fair
   life, and of her happy departure with better hopes.  Fair privileges
   these, and such as are not easily attained by many of those who plume
   themselves highly upon their noble birth, and are proud of their
   ancestry.  But, if I must treat of her case in a more philosophic and
   lofty strain, Gorgonia's native land was Jerusalem above, [3007] the
   object, not of sight but of contemplation, wherein is our commonwealth,
   and whereto we are pressing on:  whose citizen Christ is, and whose
   fellow-citizens are the assembly and church of the first born who are
   written in heaven, and feast around its great Founder in contemplation
   of His glory, and take part in the endless festival; her nobility
   consisted in the preservation of the Image, and the perfect likeness to
   the Archetype, which is produced by reason and virtue and pure desire,
   ever more and more conforming, in things pertaining to God, to those
   truly initiated into the heavenly mysteries; and in knowing whence, and
   of what character, and for what end we came into being.

   7.  This is what I know upon these points:  and therefore it is that I
   both am aware and assert that her soul was more noble than those of the
   East, [3008] according to a better than the ordinary rule of noble or
   ignoble birth, whose distinctions depend not on blood but on character;
   nor does it classify those whom it praises or blames according to their
   families, but as individuals.  But speaking as I do of her excellences
   among those who know her, let each one join in contributing some
   particular and aid me in my speech:  for it is impossible for one man
   to take in every point, however gifted with observation and
   intelligence.

   8.  In modesty she so greatly excelled, and so far surpassed, those of
   her own day, to say nothing of those of old time who have been
   illustrious for modesty, that, in regard to the two divisions of the
   life of all, that is, the married and the unmarried state, the latter
   being higher and more divine, though more difficult and dangerous,
   while the former is more humble and more safe, she was able to avoid
   the disadvantages of each, and to select and combine all that is best
   in both, namely, the elevation of the one and the security of the
   other, thus becoming modest without pride, blending the excellence of
   the married with that of the unmarried state, and proving that neither
   of them absolutely binds us to, or separates us from, God or the world
   (so that the one from its own nature must be utterly avoided, and the
   other altogether praised):  but that it is mind which nobly presides
   over wedlock and maidenhood, and arranges and works upon them as the
   raw material of virtue under the master-hand of reason.  For though she
   had entered upon a carnal union, she was not therefore separated from
   the spirit, nor, because her husband was her head, did she ignore her
   first Head:  but, performing those few ministrations due to the world
   and nature, according to the will of the law of the flesh, or rather of
   Him who gave to the flesh these laws, she consecrated herself entirely
   to God.  But what is most excellent and honourable, she also won over
   her husband to her side, and made of him a good fellow-servant, instead
   of an unreasonable master.  And not only so, but she further made the
   fruit of her body, her children and her children's children, to be the
   fruit of her spirit, dedicating to God not her single soul, but the
   whole family and household, and making wedlock illustrious through her
   own acceptability in wedlock, and the fair harvest she had reaped
   thereby; presenting herself, as long as she lived, as an example to her
   offspring of all that was good, and when summoned hence, leaving her
   will behind her, as a silent exhortation to her house.

   9.  The divine Solomon, in his instructive wisdom, I mean his Proverbs,
   praises the woman [3009] who looks to her household and loves her
   husband, contrasting her with one who roams abroad, and is uncontrolled
   and dishonourable, and hunts for precious souls with wanton words and
   ways, while she manages well at home and bravely sets about her woman's
   duties, as her hands hold the distaff, and she prepares two coats for
   her husband, buying a field in due season, and makes good provision for
   the food of her servants, and welcomes her friends at a liberal table;
   with all the other details in which he sings the praises of the modest
   and industrious woman.  Now, to praise my sister in these points would
   be to praise a statue for its shadow, or a lion for its claws, without
   allusion to its greatest perfections.  Who was more deserving of
   renown, and yet who avoided it so much and made herself inaccessible to
   the eyes of man?  Who knew better the due proportions of sobriety and
   cheerfulness, so that her sobriety should not seem inhuman, nor her
   tenderness immodest, but prudent in one, gentle in the other, her
   discretion was marked by a combination of sympathy and dignity?
   Listen, ye women addicted to ease and display, who despise the veil of
   shamefastness.  Who ever so kept her eyes under control?  Who so
   derided laughter, that the ripple of a smile seemed a great thing to
   her?  Who more steadfastly closed her ears?  And who opened them more
   to the Divine words, or rather, who installed the mind as ruler of the
   tongue in uttering the judgments of God?  Who, as she, regulated her
   lips?

   10.  Here, if you will, is another point of her excellence:  one of
   which neither she nor any truly modest and decorous woman thinks
   anything:  but which we have been made to think much of, by those who
   are too fond of ornament and display, and refuse to listen to
   instruction on such matters.  She was never adorned with gold wrought
   into artistic forms of surpassing beauty, nor flaxen tresses, fully or
   partially displayed, nor spiral curls, nor dishonouring designs of men
   who construct erections on the honourable head, nor costly folds of
   flowing and transparent robes, nor graces of brilliant stones, which
   color the neighbouring air, and cast a glow upon the form; nor the arts
   and witcheries of the painter, nor that cheap beauty of the infernal
   creator who works against the Divine, hiding with his treacherous
   pigments the creation of God, and putting it to shame with his honour,
   and setting before eager eyes the imitation of an harlot instead of the
   form of God, so that this bastard beauty may steal away that image
   which should be kept for God and for the world to come.  But though she
   was aware of the many and various external ornaments of women, yet none
   of them was more precious to her than her own character, and the
   brilliancy stored up within.  One red tint was dear to her, the blush
   of modesty; one white one, the sign of temperance:  but pigments and
   pencillings, and living pictures, and flowing lines of beauty, she left
   to women of the stage and of the streets, and to all who think it a
   shame and a reproach to be ashamed.

   11.  Enough of such topics.  Of her prudence and piety no adequate
   account can be given, nor many examples found besides those of her
   natural and spiritual parents, who were her only models, and of whose
   virtue she in no wise fell short, with this single exception most
   readily admitted, that they, as she both knew and acknowledged, were
   the source of her goodness, and the root of her own illumination.  What
   could be keener than the intellect of her who was recognized as a
   common adviser not only by those of her family, those of the same
   people and of the one fold, but even by all men round about, who
   treated her counsels and advice as a law not to be broken?  What more
   sagacious than her words?  What more prudent than her silence?  Having
   mentioned silence, I will proceed to that which was most characteristic
   of her, most becoming to women, and most serviceable to these times.
   Who had a fuller knowledge of the things of God, both from the Divine
   oracles, and from her own understanding?  But who was less ready to
   speak, confining herself within the due limits of women?  Moreover, as
   was the bounden duty of a woman who has learned true piety, and that
   which is the only honourable object of insatiate desire, who, as she,
   adorned temples with offerings, both others and this one, which will
   hardly, now she is gone, be so adorned again?  Or rather, who so
   presented herself to God as a living temple?  Who again paid such honor
   to Priests, especially to him who was her fellow soldier and teacher of
   piety, whose are the good seeds, and the pair of children consecrated
   to God.

   12.  Who opened her house to those who live according to God with a
   more graceful and bountiful welcome?  And, which is greater than this,
   who bade them welcome with such modesty and godly greetings?  Further,
   who showed a mind more unmoved in sufferings?  Whose soul was more
   sympathetic to those in trouble?  Whose hand more liberal to those in
   want?  I should not hesitate to honour her with the words of Job:  Her
   door was opened to all comers; the stranger did not lodge in the
   street.  She was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a mother to the
   orphan. [3010]   Why should I say more of her compassion to widows,
   than that its fruit which she obtained was, never to be called a widow
   herself?  Her house was a common abode to all the needy of her family;
   and her goods no less common to all in need than their own belonged to
   each.  She hath dispersed abroad and given to the poor, [3011] and
   according to the infallible truth of the Gospel, she laid up much store
   in the wine-presses above, and oftentimes entertained Christ in the
   person of those whose benefactress she was.  And, best of all, there
   was in her no unreal profession, but in secret she cultivated piety
   before Him who seeth secret things.  Everything she rescued from the
   ruler of this world, everything she transferred to the safe garners.
   Nothing did she leave behind to earth, save her body.  She bartered
   everything for the hopes above:  the sole wealth she left to her
   children was the imitation of her example, and emulation of her merits.

   13.  But amid these tokens of incredible magnanimity, she did not
   surrender her body to luxury, and unrestrained pleasures of the
   appetite, that raging and tearing dog, as though presuming upon her
   acts of benevolence, as most men do, who redeem their luxury by
   compassion to the poor, and instead of healing evil with good, receive
   evil as a recompense for their good deeds.  Nor did she, while subduing
   her dust [3012] by fasting, leave to another the medicine of hard
   lying; nor, while she found this of spiritual service, was she less
   restrained in sleep than anyone else; nor, while regulating her life on
   this point as if freed from the body, did she lie upon the ground, when
   others were passing the night erect, as the most mortified men struggle
   to do.  Nay in this respect she was seen to surpass not only women, but
   the most devoted of men, by her intelligent chanting of the psalter,
   her converse with, and unfolding and apposite recollection of, the
   Divine oracles, her bending of her knees which had grown hard and
   almost taken root in the ground, her tears to cleanse her stains with
   contrite heart and spirit of lowliness, her prayer rising heavenward,
   her mind freed from wandering in rapture; in all these, or in any one
   of them, is there man or woman who can boast of having surpassed her?
   Besides, it is a great thing to say, but it is true, that while she was
   zealous in her endeavour after some points of excellence, of others she
   was the paragon:  of some she was the discoverer, in others she
   excelled.  And if in some single particular she was rivalled, her
   superiority consists in her complete grasp of all.  Such was her
   success in all points, as none else attained even in a moderate degree
   in one:  to such perfection did she attain in each particular, that any
   one might of itself have supplied the place of all.

   14.  O untended body, and squalid garments, whose only flower is
   virtue!  O soul, clinging to the body, when reduced almost to an
   immaterial state through lack of food; or rather, when the body had
   been mortified by force, even before dissolution, that the soul might
   attain to freedom, and escape the entanglements of the senses!  O
   nights of vigil, and psalmody, and standing which lasts from one day to
   another!  O David, whose strains never seem tedious to faithful souls!
   O tender limbs, flung upon the earth and, contrary to nature, growing
   hard!  O fountains of tears, sowing in affliction that they might reap
   in joy. [3013]   O cry in the night, piercing the clouds and reaching
   unto Him that dwelleth in the heavens!  O fervour of spirit, waxing
   bold in prayerful longings against the dogs of night, and frosts and
   rain, and thunders, and hail, and darkness!  O nature of woman
   overcoming that of man in the common struggle for salvation, and
   demonstrating that the distinction between male and female is one of
   body not of soul!  O Baptismal purity, O soul, in the pure chamber of
   thy body, the bride of Christ!  O bitter eating!  O Eve mother of our
   race and of our sin!  O subtle serpent, and death, overcome by her
   self-discipline!  O self-emptying of Christ, and form of a servant, and
   sufferings, honoured by her mortification!

   15.  Oh! how am I to count up all her traits, or pass over most of them
   without injury to those who know them not?  Here however it is right to
   subjoin the rewards of her piety, for indeed I take it that you, who
   knew her life well, have long been eager and desirous to find in my
   speech not only things present, or her joys yonder, beyond the
   conception and hearing and sight of man, but also those which the
   righteous Rewarder bestowed upon her here:  a matter which often tends
   to the edification of unbelievers, who from small things attain to
   faith in those which are great, and from things which are seen to those
   which are not seen.  I will mention then some facts which are generally
   notorious, others which have been from most men kept secret; and that
   because her Christian principle made a point of not making a display of
   her [Divine] favours.  You know how her maddened mules ran away with
   her carriage, and unfortunately overturned it, how horribly she was
   dragged along, and seriously injured, to the scandal of unbelievers at
   the permission of such accidents to the righteous, and how quickly
   their unbelief was corrected:  for, all crushed and bruised as she was,
   in bones and limbs, alike in those exposed and in those out of sight,
   she would have none of any physician, except Him Who had permitted it;
   both because she shrunk from the inspection and the hands of men,
   preserving, even in suffering, her modesty, and also awaiting her
   justification from Him Who allowed this to happen, so that she owed her
   preservation to none other than to Him:  with the result that men were
   no less struck by her unhoped-for recovery than by her misfortune, and
   concluded that the tragedy had happened for her glorification through
   sufferings, the suffering being human, the recovery superhuman, and
   giving a lesson to those who come after, exhibiting in a high degree
   faith in the midst of suffering, and patience under calamity, but in a
   still higher degree the kindness of God to them that are such as she.
   For to the beautiful promise to the righteous "though he fall, he shall
   not be utterly broken," [3014] has been added one more recent, "though
   he be utterly broken, he shall speedily be raised up and glorified."
   [3015]   For if her misfortune was unreasonable, her recovery was
   extraordinary, so that health soon stole away the injury, and the cure
   became more celebrated than the blow.

   16.  O remarkable and wonderful disaster!  O injury more noble than
   security!  O prophecy, "He hath smitten, and He will bind us up, and
   revive us, and after three days He will raise us up," [3016] portending
   indeed, as it did, a greater and more sublime event, yet no less
   applicable to Gorgonia's sufferings!  This then, notorious to all, even
   to those afar off, for the wonder spread to all, and the lesson was
   stored up in the tongues and ears of all, with the other wonderful
   works and powers of God.  But the following incident, hitherto unknown
   and concealed from most men by the Christian principle I spoke of, and
   her pious shrinking from vanity and display, dost thou bid me tell, O
   best [3017] and most perfect of shepherds, pastor of this holy sheep,
   and dost thou further give thy assent to it, since to us alone has this
   secret been entrusted, and we were mutual witnesses of the marvel, or
   are we still to keep our faith to her who is gone?  Yet I do think,
   that as that was the time to be silent, this is the time to manifest
   it, not only for the glory of God, but also for the consolation of
   those in affliction.

   17.  She was sick in body, and dangerously ill of an extraordinary and
   malignant disease, her whole frame was incessantly fevered, her blood
   at one time agitated and boiling, then curdling with coma, incredible
   pallor, and paralysis of mind and limbs:  and this not at long
   intervals, but sometimes very frequently.  Its virulence seemed beyond
   human aid; the skill of physicians, who carefully examined the case,
   both singly and in consultation, was of no avail; nor the tears of her
   parents, which often have great power, nor public supplications and
   intercessions, in which all the people joined as earnestly as if for
   their own preservation:  for her safety was the safety of all, as, on
   the contrary, her suffering and sickness was a common misfortune.

   18.  What then did this great soul, worthy offspring of the greatest,
   and what was the medicine for her disorder, for we have now come to the
   great secret?  Despairing of all other aid, she betook herself to the
   Physician of all, and awaiting the silent hours of night, during a
   slight intermission of the disease, she approached the altar with
   faith, and, calling upon Him Who is honoured thereon, with a mighty
   cry, and every kind of invocation, calling to mind all His former works
   of power, and well she knew those both of ancient and of later days, at
   last she ventured on an act of pious and splendid effrontery:  she
   imitated the woman whose fountain of blood was dried up by the hem of
   Christ's garment. [3018]   What did she do?  Resting her head with
   another cry upon the altar, and with a wealth of tears, as she who once
   bedewed the feet of Christ, [3019] and declaring that she would not
   loose her hold until she was made whole, she then applied her medicine
   to her whole body, viz., such a portion of the antitypes [3020] of the
   Precious Body and Blood as she treasured in her hand, mingling
   therewith her tears, and, O the wonder, she went away feeling at once
   that she was saved, and with the lightness of health in body, soul, and
   mind, having received, as the reward of her hope, that which she hoped
   for, and having gained bodily by means of spiritual strength.  Great
   though these things be, they are not untrue.  Believe them all of you,
   whether sick or sound, that ye may either keep or regain your health.
   And that my story is no mere boastfulness is plain from the silence in
   which she kept, while alive, what I have revealed.  Nor should I now
   have published it, be well assured, had I not feared that so great a
   marvel would have been utterly hidden from the faithful and unbelieving
   of these and later days.

   19.  Such was her life.  Most of its details I have left untold, lest
   my speech should grow to undue proportions, and lest I should seem to
   be too greedy for her fair fame:  but perhaps we should be wronging her
   holy and illustrious death, did we not mention some of its excellences;
   especially as she so longed for and desired it.  I will do so
   therefore, as concisely as I can.  She longed for her dissolution, for
   indeed she had great boldness towards Him who called her, and preferred
   to be with Christ, beyond all things on earth. [3021]   And there is
   none of the most amorous and unrestrained, who has such love for his
   body, as she had to fling away these fetters, and escape from the mire
   in which we spend our lives, and to associate in purity with Him Who is
   Fair, and entirely to hold her Beloved, Who is I will even say it, her
   Lover, by Whose rays, feeble though they now are, we are enlightened,
   and Whom, though separated from Him, we are able to know.  Nor did she
   fail even of this desire, divine and sublime though it was, and, what
   is still greater, she had a foretaste of His Beauty through her
   forecast and constant watching.  Her only sleep transferred her to
   exceeding joys, and her one vision embraced her departure at the
   foreappointed time, having been made aware of this day, so that
   according to the decision of God she might be prepared and yet not
   disturbed.

   20.  She had recently obtained the blessing of cleansing and
   perfection, which we have all received from God as a common gift and
   foundation of our new [3022] life.  Or rather all her life was a
   cleansing and perfecting:  and while she received regeneration from the
   Holy Spirit, its security was hers by virtue of her former life.  And
   in her case almost alone, I will venture to say, the mystery was a seal
   rather than a gift of grace.  And when her husband's perfection was her
   one remaining desire (and if you wish me briefly to describe the man, I
   do not know what more to say of him than that he was her husband) in
   order that she might be consecrated to God in her whole body, and not
   depart half-perfected, or leave behind her imperfect anything that was
   hers; she did not even fail of this petition, from Him Who fulfils the
   desire of them that fear Him, [3023] and accomplishes their requests.

   21.  And now when she had all things to her mind, and nothing was
   lacking of her desires, and the appointed time drew nigh, being thus
   prepared for death and departure, she fulfilled the law which prevails
   in such matters, and took to her bed.  After many injunctions to her
   husband, her children, and her friends, as was to be expected from one
   who was full of conjugal, maternal, and brotherly love, and after
   making her last day a day of solemn festival with brilliant discourse
   upon the things above, she fell asleep, full not of the days of man,
   for which she had no desire, knowing them to be evil for her, and
   mainly occupied with our dust and wanderings, but more exceedingly full
   of the days of God, than I imagine any one even of those who have
   departed in a wealth of hoary hairs, and have numbered many terms of
   years.  Thus she was set free, or, it is better to say, taken to God,
   or flew away, or changed her abode, or anticipated by a little the
   departure of her body.

   22.  Yet what was I on the point of omitting?  But perhaps thou, who
   art her spiritual father, wouldst not have allowed me, and hast
   carefully concealed the wonder, and made it known to me.  It is a great
   point for her distinction, and in our memory of her virtue, and regret
   for her departure.  But trembling and tears have seized upon me, at the
   recollection of the wonder.  She was just passing away, and at her last
   breath, surrounded by a group of relatives and friends performing the
   last offices of kindness, while her aged mother bent over her, with her
   soul convulsed with envy of her departure, anguish and affection being
   blended in the minds of all.  Some longed to hear some burning word to
   be branded in their recollection; others were eager to speak, yet no
   one dared; for tears were mute and the pangs of grief unconsoled, since
   it seemed sacrilegious, to think that mourning could be an honour to
   one who was thus passing away.  So there was solemn silence, as if her
   death had been a religious ceremony.  There she lay, to all appearance,
   breathless, motionless, speechless; the stillness of her body seemed
   paralysis, as though the organs of speech were dead, after that which
   could move them was gone.  But as her pastor, who in this wonderful
   scene, was carefully watching her, perceived that her lips were gently
   moving, and placed his ear to them, which his disposition and sympathy
   emboldened him to do,--but do you expound the meaning of this
   mysterious calm, for no one can disbelieve it on your word!  Under her
   breath she was repeating a psalm--the last words of a psalm--to say the
   truth, a testimony to the boldness with which she was departing, and
   blessed is he who can fall asleep with these words, "I will lay me down
   in peace, and take my rest." [3024]   Thus wert thou singing, fairest
   of women, and thus it fell out unto thee; and the song became a
   reality, and attended on thy departure as a memorial of thee, who hast
   entered upon sweet peace after suffering, and received (over and above
   the rest which comes to all), that sleep which is due to the beloved,
   [3025] as befitted one who lived and died amid the words of piety.

   23.  Better, I know well, and far more precious than eye can see, is
   thy present lot, the song of them that keep holy-day, [3026] the throng
   of angels, the heavenly host, the vision of glory, and that splendour,
   pure and perfect beyond all other, of the Trinity Most High, no longer
   beyond the ken of the captive mind, dissipated by the senses, but
   entirely contemplated and possessed by the undivided mind, and flashing
   upon our souls with the whole light of Godhead:  Mayest thou enjoy to
   the full all those things whose crumbs thou didst, while still upon
   earth, possess through the reality of thine inclination towards them.
   And if thou takest any account of our affairs, and holy souls receive
   from God this privilege, do thou accept these words of mine, in place
   of, and in preference to many panegyrics, which I have bestowed upon
   Cæsarius before thee, and upon thee after him--since I have been
   preserved to pronounce panegyrics upon my brethren.  If any one will,
   after you, pay me the like honour, I cannot say.  Yet may my only
   honour be that which is in God, and may my pilgrimage and my home be in
   Christ Jesus our Lord, to Whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be
   glory for ever.  Amen.

   Oration XII.

   To His Father, When He Had Entrusted to Him the Care of the Church of
   Nazianzus.

   ThisOration was delivered a.d. 372.  Two years earlier Valens had
   divided Cappadocia into two provinces.  Anthimus, Bishop of Tyana,
   asserting that the ecclesiastical provinces were regulated by those of
   the empire, claimed metropolitical rights over the churches of
   Cappadocia Secunda, in opposition to S. Basil, who had hitherto been
   metropolitan of the undivided province.  S. Basil, with the intention
   of vindicating the permanence of his former rights, created a new see
   at Sasima, on the borders of the two provinces, and with great
   difficulty prevailed upon S. Gregory to receive consecration as its
   first Bishop.  S. Gregory, who had "bent his neck, but not his will,"
   [3027] was for a long time reluctant to enter upon his Episcopal
   duties, and at last was prevailed upon by S. Gregory of Nyssa, S.
   Basil's brother, to make an attempt to do so.  When, however, he found
   that Anthimus was prepared to bar his entrance by force of arms, he
   returned home, definitely resigned his see, and once more betook
   himself to the life of solitude which he so dearly loved.  Recalled
   hence, he consented, [3028] at his father's earnest entreaty, to
   undertake provisionally the duties of Bishop-coadjutor of Nazianzus:
   and pronounced this short discourse on the occasion of his
   installation.

   1.  I opened my mouth, and drew in the Spirit, [3029] and I give myself
   and my all to the Spirit, my action and speech, my inaction and
   silence, only let Him hold me and guide me, and move both hand and mind
   and tongue whither it is right, and He wills:  and restrain them as it
   is right and expedient.  I am an instrument of God, a rational
   instrument, an instrument tuned and struck by that skilful artist, the
   Spirit.  Yesterday His work in me was silence.  I mused on abstinence
   from speech.  Does He strike upon my mind today?  My speech shall be
   heard, and I will muse on utterance.  I am neither so talkative, as to
   desire to speak, when He is bent on silence; nor so reserved and
   ignorant as to set a watch before my lips [3030] when it is the time to
   speak:  but I open and close my door at the will of that Mind and Word
   and Spirit, Who is One kindred Deity.

   2.  I will speak then, since I am so bidden.  And I will speak both to
   the good shepherd here, and to you, his holy flock, as I think is best
   both for me to speak, and for you to hear to-day.  Why is it that you
   have begged for one to share your shepherd's toil?  For my speech shall
   begin with you, O dear and honoured head, worthy of that of Aaron, down
   which runs that spiritual and priestly ointment upon his beard and
   clothing. [3031]   Why is it that, while yet able to stablish and guide
   many, and actually guiding them in the power of the Spirit, you support
   yourself with a staff and prop in your spiritual works?  Is it because
   you have heard and know that even with the illustrious Aaron were
   anointed Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron? [3032]   For I pass
   over Nadab and Abihu, [3033] lest the allusion be ill-omened:  and
   Moses during his lifetime appoints Joshua in his stead, as lawgiver and
   general over those who were pressing on to the land of promise?  The
   office of Aaron and Hur, supporting the hands of Moses on the mount
   where Amalek was warred down [3034] by the Cross, [3035] prefigured and
   typified long before, I feel willing to pass by, as not very suitable
   or applicable to us:  for Moses did not choose them to share his work
   as lawgiver, but as helpers in his prayer and supports for the
   weariness of his hands.

   3.  What is it then that ails you?  What is your weakness?  Is it
   physical?  I am ready to sustain you, yea I have sustained, and been
   sustained, like Jacob of old, by your fatherly blessings. [3036]   Is
   it spiritual?  Who is stronger, and more fervent, especially now, when
   the powers of the flesh are ebbing and fading, like so many barriers
   which interfere with, and dim the brilliancy of a light?  For these
   powers are wont, for the most part, to wage war upon and oppose one
   another, while the body's health is purchased by the sickness of the
   soul, and the soul flourishes and looks upward when pleasures are
   stilled and fade away along with the body.  But, wonderful as your
   simplicity and nobility have seemed to me before, how is it that you
   have no fear, especially in times like these, that your spirit will be
   considered a pretext, and that most men will suppose, in spite of our
   spiritual professions, that we are undertaking this from carnal
   motives.  For most men have made [3037] the office to be looked upon as
   great and princely, and accompanied with considerable enjoyment, even
   though a man have the charge and rule over a more slender flock than
   this, and one which affords more troubles than pleasures.  Thus far of
   your simplicity, or parental preference, if it be so, which makes you
   neither admit yourself, nor readily suspect in others anything
   disgraceful; for a mind hardly roused to evil, is slow to suspect
   evil.  My second duty is briefly to address this people of yours, or
   now even of mine.

   4.  I have been overpowered, my friends and brethren, for I will now,
   though I did not at the time, ask for your aid.  I have been
   overpowered by the old age of my father, and, to use moderate terms,
   the kindliness of my friend.  So, help me, each of you who can, and
   stretch out a hand to me who am pressed down and torn asunder by regret
   and enthusiasm.  The one suggests flights, mountains and deserts, and
   calm of soul and body, and that the mind should retire into itself, and
   recall its powers from sensible things, in order to hold pure communion
   with God, and be clearly illumined by the flashing rays of the Spirit,
   with no admixture or disturbance of the divine light by anything
   earthly or clouded, until we come to the source of the effulgence which
   we enjoy here, and regret and desire are alike stayed, when our mirrors
   [3038] pass away in the light of truth.  The other wills that I should
   come forward, and bear fruit for the common good, and be helped by
   helping others; and publish the Divine light, and bring to God a people
   for His own possession, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, [3039] and
   His image cleansed in many souls.  And this, because, as a park is
   better than and preferable to a tree, the whole heaven with its
   ornaments to a single star, and the body to a limb, so also, in the
   sight of God, is the reformation of a whole church preferable to the
   progress of a single soul:  and therefore, I ought not to look only on
   my own interest, but also on that of others. [3040]   For Christ also
   likewise, when it was possible for him to abide in His own honour and
   deity, not only so far emptied Himself as to take the form of a slave,
   [3041] but also endured the cross, despising the shame, [3042] that he
   might by His own sufferings destroy sin, and by death slay death.
   [3043]   The former are the imaginings of desire, the latter the
   teachings of the Spirit.  And I, standing midway between the desire and
   the Spirit, and not knowing to which of the two I should rather yield,
   will impart to you what seems to me the best and safest course, that
   you may test it with me and take part in my design.

   5.  It seemed to me to be best and least dangerous to take a middle
   course between desire and fear, and to yield in part to desire, in part
   to the Spirit:  and that this would be the case, if I neither
   altogether evaded the office, and so refused the grace, which would be
   dangerous, nor yet assumed a burden beyond my powers, for it is a heavy
   one.  The former indeed is suited to the person of another, the latter
   to another's power, or rather to undertake both would be madness.  But
   piety and safety would alike advise me to proportion the office to my
   power, and as is the case with food, to accept that which is within my
   power and refuse what is beyond it, for health is gained for the body,
   and tranquillity for the soul, by such a course of moderation.
   Therefore I now consent to share in the cares of my excellent father,
   like an eaglet, not quite vainly flying close to a mighty and high
   soaring eagle.  But hereafter I will offer my wing to the Spirit to be
   borne whither, and as, He wills:  no one shall force or drag me in any
   direction, contrary to His counsel.  For sweet it is to inherit a
   father's toils, and this flock is more familiar than a strange and
   foreign one; I would even add, more precious in the sight of God,
   unless the spell of affection deceives me, and the force of habit robs
   me of perception:  nor is there any more useful or safer course than
   that willing rulers should rule willing subjects:  since it is our
   practice not to lead by force, or by compulsion, but by good will.  For
   this would not hold together even another form of government, since
   that which is held in by force is wont, when opportunity offers, to
   strike for freedom:  but freedom of will more than anything else it is,
   which holds together our--I will not call it rule, but--tutorship.  For
   the mystery of godliness [3044] belongs to those who are willing, not
   to those who are overpowered.

   6.  This is my speech to you, my good men, uttered in simplicity and
   with all good will, and this is the secret of my mind.  And may the
   victory rest with that which will be for the profit of both you and me,
   under the Spirit's guidance of our affairs, (for our discourse comes
   back again to the same point,) [3045] to Whom we have given ourselves,
   and the head anointed with the oil of perfection, in the Almighty
   Father, and the Only-begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit, Who is God.
   For how long shall we hide [3046] the lamp under the bushel, [3047] and
   withhold from others the full knowledge of the Godhead, when it ought
   to be now put upon the lampstand and give light to all churches and
   souls and to the whole fulness of the world, no longer by means of
   metaphors, or intellectual sketches, but by distinct declaration?  And
   this indeed is a most perfect setting forth of Theology to those Who
   have been deemed worthy of this grace in Christ Jesus Himself, our
   Lord, to Whom be glory, honour, and power for ever.  Amen.

   Oration XVI.

   On His Father's Silence, Because of the Plague of Hail.

   ThisOration belongs to the year a.d. 373.  A series of disasters had
   befallen the people of Nazianzus.  A deadly cattle plague, which had
   devastated their herds, had been followed by a prolonged drought, and
   now their just ripened crops had been ruined by a storm of rain and
   hail.  The people flocked to the church, and finding S. Gregory the
   elder so overwhelmed by his sense of these terrible misfortunes that he
   was unable to address them, implored his coadjutor to enter the
   pulpit.  The occasion gave no time for preparation, so S. Gregory
   poured out his feelings in a discourse which was in the fullest sense
   of the words ex tempore.  Its present form, however, as Benoît
   suggests, may be due to a later polishing of notes taken down at the
   time of delivery.

   1.  Why do you infringe upon the approved order of things?  Why would
   you do violence to a tongue which is under obligation to the law?  Why
   do you challenge a speech which is in subjection to the Spirit?  Why,
   when you have excused the head, have you hastened to the feet?  Why do
   you pass by Aaron [3048] and urge forward Eleazar?  I cannot allow the
   fountain to be dammed up, while the rivulet runs its course; the sun to
   be hidden, while the star shines forth; hoar hairs to be in retirement,
   while youth lays down the law; wisdom to be silent, while inexperience
   speaks with assurance.  A heavy rain is not always more useful than a
   gentle shower.  Nay, indeed, if it be too violent, it sweeps away the
   earth, and increases the proportion of the farmer's loss:  while a
   gentle fall, which sinks deep, enriches the soil, benefits the tiller
   and makes the corn grow to a fine crop.  So the fluent speech is not
   more profitable than the wise.  For the one, though it perhaps gave a
   slight pleasure, passes away, and is dispersed as soon, and with as
   little effect, as the air on which it struck, though it charms with its
   eloquence the greedy ear.  But the other sinks into the mind, and
   opening wide its mouth, fills it [3049] with the Spirit, and, showing
   itself nobler than its origin, produces a rich harvest by a few
   syllables.

   2.  I have not yet alluded to the true and first wisdom, for which our
   wonderful husbandman and shepherd is conspicuous.  The first wisdom is
   a life worthy of praise, and kept pure for God, or being purified for
   Him Who is all-pure and all-luminous, Who demands of us, us His only
   sacrifice, purification--that is, a contrite heart and the sacrifice of
   praise, [3050] and a new creation in Christ, [3051] and the new man,
   [3052] and the like, as the Scripture loves to call it.  The first
   wisdom is to despise that wisdom which consists of language and figures
   of speech, and spurious and unnecessary embellishments.  Be it mine to
   speak five words with my understanding in the church, rather than ten
   thousand words in a tongue, [3053] and with the unmeaning voice of a
   trumpet, [3054] which does not rouse my soldier to the spiritual
   combat.  This is the wisdom which I praise, which I welcome.  By this
   the ignoble have won renown, and the despised have attained the highest
   honours.  By this a crew of fishermen have taken the whole world in the
   meshes of the Gospel-net, and overcome by a word finished and cut short
   [3055] the wisdom that comes to naught. [3056]   I count not wise the
   man who is clever in words, nor him who is of a ready tongue, but
   unstable and undisciplined in soul, like the tombs which, fair and
   beautiful as they are outwardly, are fetid with corpses within, [3057]
   and full of manifold ill-savours; but him who speaks but little of
   virtue, yet gives many examples of it in his practice, and proves the
   trustworthiness of his language by his life.

   3.  Fairer in my eyes, is the beauty which we can gaze upon than that
   which is painted in words:  of more value the wealth which our hands
   can hold, than that which is imagined in our dreams; and more real the
   wisdom of which we are convinced by deeds, than that which is set forth
   in splendid language.  For "a good understanding," he saith, "have all
   they that do thereafter," [3058] not they who proclaim it.  Time is the
   best touchstone of this wisdom, and "the hoary head is a crown of
   glory." [3059]   For if, as it seems to me as well as to Solomon, we
   must "judge none blessed before his death," [3060] and it is uncertain
   "what a day may bring forth," [3061] since our life here below has many
   turnings, and the body of our humiliation [3062] is ever rising,
   falling and changing; surely he, who without fault has almost drained
   the cup of life, and nearly reached the haven of the common sea of
   existence is more secure, and therefore more enviable, than one who has
   yet a long voyage before him.

   4.  Do not thou, therefore, restrain a tongue whose noble utterances
   and fruits have been many, which has begotten many children of
   righteousness--yea, lift up thine eyes round about and see, [3063] how
   many are its sons, and what are its treasures; even this whole people,
   whom thou hast begotten in Christ through the Gospel. [3064]   Grudge
   not to us those words which are excellent rather than many, and do not
   yet give us a foretaste of our impending loss. [3065]   Speak in words
   which, if few, are dear and most sweet to me, which, if scarcely
   audible, are perceived from their spiritual cry, as God heard the
   silence of Moses, and said to him when interceding mentally, "Why
   criest thou unto Me?" [3066]   Comfort this people, I pray thee, I, who
   was thy nursling, and have since been made Pastor, and now even Chief
   Pastor.  Give a lesson, to me in the Pastor's art, to this people of
   obedience.  Discourse awhile on our present heavy blow, about the just
   judgments of God, whether we grasp their meaning, or are ignorant of
   their great deep. [3067]   How again "mercy is put in the balance,"
   [3068] as holy Isaiah declares, for goodness is not without
   discernment, as the first labourers in the vineyard [3069] fancied,
   because they could not perceive any distinction between those who were
   paid alike:  and how anger, which is called "the cup in the hand of the
   Lord," [3070] and "the cup of falling which is drained," [3071] is in
   proportion to transgressions, even though He abates to all somewhat of
   what is their due, and dilutes with compassion the unmixed draught of
   His wrath.  For He inclines from severity to indulgence towards those
   who accept chastisement with fear, and who after a slight affliction
   conceive and are in pain with conversion, and bring forth [3072] the
   perfect spirit of salvation; but nevertheless he reserves the dregs,
   [3073] the last drop of His anger, that He may pour it out entire upon
   those who, instead of being healed by His kindness, grow obdurate, like
   the hard-hearted Pharaoh, [3074] that bitter taskmaster, who is set
   forth as an example of the power [3075] of God over the ungodly.

   5.  Tell us whence come such blows and scourges, and what account we
   can give of them.  Is it some disordered and irregular motion or some
   unguided current, some unreason of the universe, as though there were
   no Ruler of the world, which is therefore borne along by chance, as is
   the doctrine of the foolishly wise, who are themselves borne along at
   random by the disorderly spirit of darkness?  Or are the disturbances
   and changes of the universe, (which was originally constituted,
   blended, bound together, and set in motion in a harmony known only to
   Him Who gave it motion,) directed by reason and order under the
   guidance of the reins of Providence?  Whence come famines and tornadoes
   and hailstorms, our present warning blow?  Whence pestilences,
   diseases, earthquakes, tidal waves, and fearful things in the heavens?
   And how is the creation, once ordered for the enjoyment of men, their
   common and equal delight, changed for the punishment of the ungodly, in
   order that we may be chastised through that for which, when honoured
   with it, we did not give thanks, and recognise in our sufferings that
   power which we did not recognise in our benefits?  How is it that some
   receive at the Lord's hand double for their sins, [3076] and the
   measure of their wickedness is doubly filled up, as in the correction
   of Israel, while the sins of others are done away by a sevenfold
   recompense into their bosom? [3077]   What is the measure of the
   Amorites that is not yet full? [3078]   And how is the sinner either
   let go, or chastised again, let go perhaps, because reserved for the
   other world, chastised, because healed thereby in this?  Under what
   circumstances again is the righteous, when unfortunate, possibly being
   put to the test, or, when prosperous, being observed, to see if he be
   poor in mind or not very far superior to visible things, as indeed
   conscience, our interior and unerring tribunal, tells us.  What is our
   calamity, and what its cause?  Is it a test of virtue, or a touchstone
   of wickedness?  And is it better to bow beneath it as a chastisement,
   even though it be not so, and humble ourselves under the mighty hand of
   God, [3079] or, considering it as a trial, to rise superior to it?  On
   these points give us instruction and warning, lest we be too much
   discouraged by our present calamity, or fall into the gulf of evil and
   despise it; for some such feeling is very general; but rather that we
   may bear our admonition quietly, and not provoke one more severe by our
   insensibility to this.

   6.  Terrible is an unfruitful season, and the loss of the crops.  It
   could not be otherwise, when men are already rejoicing in their hopes,
   and counting on their all but harvested stores.  Terrible again is an
   unseasonable harvest, when the farmers labour with heavy hearts,
   sitting as it were beside the grave of their crops, which the gentle
   rain nourished, but the wild storm has rooted up, whereof the mower
   filleth not his hand, neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom,
   [3080] nor have they obtained the blessing which passers-by bestow upon
   the farmers.  Wretched indeed is the sight of the ground devastated,
   cleared, and shorn of its ornaments, over which the blessed Joel wails
   in his most tragic picture of the desolation of the land, and the
   scourge of famine; [3081] while another [3082] prophet wails, as he
   contrasts with its former beauty its final disorder, and thus
   discourses on the anger of the Lord when He smites the land:  before
   him is the garden of Eden, behind Him a desolate wilderness. [3083]
   Terrible indeed these things are, and more than terrible, when we are
   grieved only at what is present, and are not yet distressed by the
   feeling of a severer blow:  since, as in sickness, the suffering which
   pains us from time to time is more distressing than that which is not
   present.  But more terrible still are those which the treasures [3084]
   of God's wrath contain, of which God forbid that you should make trial;
   nor will you, if you fly for refuge to the mercies of God, and win over
   by your tears Him Who will have mercy, [3085] and avert by your
   conversion what remains of His wrath.  As yet, this is gentleness and
   loving-kindness and gentle reproof, and the first elements of a scourge
   to train our tender years:  as yet, the smoke [3086] of His anger, the
   prelude of His torments; not yet has fallen the flaming fire, [3087]
   the climax of His being moved; not yet the kindled coals, [3088] the
   final scourge, part of which He threatened, when He lifted up the other
   over us, part He held back by force, when He brought the other upon us;
   using the threat and the blow alike for our instruction, and making a
   way for His indignation, in the excess of His goodness; beginning with
   what is slight, so that the more severe may not be needed; but ready to
   instruct us by what is greater, if He be forced so to do.

   7.  I know the glittering sword, [3089] and the blade made drunk in
   heaven, bidden to slay, to bring to naught, to make childless, and to
   spare neither flesh, nor marrow, nor bones.  I know Him, Who, though
   free from passion, meets us like a bear robbed of her whelps, like a
   leopard in the way of the Assyrians, [3090] not only those of that day,
   but if anyone now is an Assyrian in wickedness:  nor is it possible to
   escape the might and speed of His wrath when He watches over our
   impieties, and His jealousy, [3091] which knoweth to devour His
   adversaries, pursues His enemies to the death. [3092]   I know the
   emptying, the making void, the making waste, the melting of the heart,
   and knocking of the knees together, [3093] such are the punishments of
   the ungodly.  I do not dwell on the judgments to come, to which
   indulgence in this world delivers us, as it is better to be punished
   and cleansed now than to be transmitted to the torment to come, when it
   is the time of chastisement, not of cleansing.  For as he who remembers
   God here is conqueror of death (as David [3094] has most excellently
   sung) so the departed have not in the grave confession and restoration;
   for God has confined life and action to this world, and to the future
   the scrutiny of what has been done.

   8.  What shall we do in the day of visitation, [3095] with which one of
   the Prophets terrifies me, whether that of the righteous sentence of
   God against us, or that upon the mountains and hills, of which we have
   heard, or whatever and whenever it may be, when He will reason with us,
   and oppose us, and set before us [3096] those bitter accusers, our
   sins, comparing our wrongdoings with our benefits, and striking thought
   with thought, and scrutinising action with action, and calling us to
   account for the image [3097] which has been blurred and spoilt by
   wickedness, till at last He leads us away self-convicted and
   self-condemned, no longer able to say that we are being unjustly
   treated--a thought which is able even here sometimes to console in
   their condemnation those who are suffering.

   9.  But then what advocate shall we have?  What pretext?  What false
   excuse?  What plausible artifice?  What device contrary to the truth
   will impose upon the court, and rob it of its right judgment, which
   places in the balance for us all, our entire life, action, word, and
   thought, and weighs against the evil that which is better, until that
   which preponderates wins the day, and the decision is given in favour
   of the main tendency; after which there is no appeal, no higher court,
   no defence on the ground of subsequent conduct, no oil obtained from
   the wise virgins, or from them that sell, for the lamps going out,
   [3098] no repentance of the rich man wasting away in the flame, [3099]
   and begging for repentance for his friends, no statute of limitations;
   but only that final and fearful judgment-seat, more just even than
   fearful; or rather more fearful because it is also just; when the
   thrones are set and the Ancient of days takes His seat, [3100] and the
   books are opened, and the fiery stream comes forth, and the light
   before Him, and the darkness prepared; and they that have done good
   shall go into the resurrection of life, [3101] now hid in Christ [3102]
   and to be manifested hereafter with Him, and they that have done evil,
   into the resurrection of judgment, [3103] to which they who have not
   believed have been condemned already by the word which judges them.
   [3104]   Some will be welcomed by the unspeakable light and the vision
   of the holy and royal Trinity, Which now shines upon them with greater
   brilliancy and purity and unites Itself wholly to the whole soul, in
   which solely and beyond all else I take it that the kingdom of heaven
   consists.  The others among other torments, but above and before them
   all must endure the being outcast from God, and the shame of conscience
   which has no limit.  But of these anon.

   10.  What are we to do now, my brethren, when crushed, cast down, and
   drunken but not with strong drink nor with wine, [3105] which excites
   and obfuscates but for a while, but with the blow which the Lord has
   inflicted upon us, Who says, And thou, O heart, be stirred and shaken,
   [3106] and gives to the despisers the spirit of sorrow and deep sleep
   to drink: [3107]   to whom He also says, See, ye despisers, behold, and
   wonder and perish? [3108]   How shall we bear His convictions; or what
   reply shall we make, when He reproaches us not only with the multitude
   of the benefits for which we have continued ungrateful, but also with
   His chastisements, and reckons up the remedies with which we have
   refused to be healed?  Calling us His children [3109] indeed, but
   unworthy children, and His sons, but strange sons [3110] who have
   stumbled from lameness out of their paths, in the trackless and rough
   ground.  How and by what means could I have instructed you, and I have
   not done so?  By gentler measures?  I have applied them.  I passed by
   the blood drunk in Egypt from the wells and rivers and all reservoirs
   of water [3111] in the first plague:  I passed over the next scourges,
   the frogs, lice, and flies.  I began with the flocks and the cattle and
   the sheep, the fifth plague, and, sparing as yet the rational
   creatures, I struck the animals.  You made light of the stroke, and
   treated me with less reason and attention than the beasts who were
   struck.  I withheld from you the rain; one piece was rained upon, and
   the piece whereupon it rained not withered, [3112] and ye said "We will
   brave it." [3113]   I brought the hail upon you, chastising you with
   the opposite kind of blow, I uprooted your vineyards and shrubberies,
   and crops, but I failed to shatter your wickedness.

   11.  Perchance He will say to me, who am not reformed even by blows, I
   know that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, [3114] the
   heedless is heedless and the lawless man acts lawlessly, [3115] naught
   is the heavenly correction, naught the scourges.  The bellows are
   burnt, the lead is consumed, [3116] as I once reproached you by the
   mouth of Jeremiah, the founder melted the silver in vain, your
   wickednesses are not melted away.  Can ye abide my wrath, saith the
   Lord.  Has not My hand the power to inflict upon you other plagues
   also?  There are still at My command the blains breaking forth from the
   ashes of the furnace, [3117] by sprinkling which toward heaven, Moses,
   or any other minister of God's action, may chastise Egypt with
   disease.  There remain also the locusts, the darkness that may be felt,
   and the plague which, last in order, was first in suffering and power,
   the destruction and death of the firstborn, and, to escape this, and to
   turn aside the destroyer, it were better to sprinkle the doorposts of
   our mind, contemplation and action, with the great and saving token,
   with the blood of the new covenant, by being crucified and dying with
   Christ, that we may both rise and be glorified and reign with Him both
   now and at His final appearing, and not be broken and crushed, and made
   to lament, when the grievous destroyer smites us all too late in this
   life of darkness, and destroys our firstborn, the offspring and results
   of our life which we had dedicated to God.

   12.  Far be it from me that I should ever, among other chastisements,
   be thus reproached by Him Who is good, but walks contrary to me in fury
   [3118] because of my own contrariness:  I have smitten you with
   blasting and mildew, and blight; [3119] without result.  The sword from
   without [3120] made you childless, yet have ye not returned unto Me,
   saith the Lord.  May I not become the vine of the beloved, which after
   being planted and entrenched, and made sure with a fence and tower and
   every means which was possible, when it ran wild and bore thorns, was
   consequently despised, and had its tower broken down and its fence
   taken away, and was not pruned nor digged, but was devoured and laid
   waste and trodden down by all! [3121]   This is what I feel I must say
   as to my fears, thus have I been pained by this blow, and this, I will
   further tell you, is my prayer.  We have sinned, we have done amiss,
   and have dealt wickedly, [3122] for we have forgotten Thy commandments
   and walked after our own evil thought, [3123] for we have behaved
   ourselves unworthily of the calling and gospel of Thy Christ, and of
   His holy sufferings and humiliation for us; we have become a reproach
   to Thy beloved, priest and people, we have erred together, we have all
   gone out of the way, we have together become unprofitable, there is
   none that doeth judgment and justice, no not one. [3124]   We have cut
   short Thy mercies and kindness and the bowels and compassion of our
   God, by our wickedness and the perversity of our doings, in which we
   have turned away.  Thou art good, but we have done amiss; Thou art
   long-suffering, but we are worthy of stripes; we acknowledge Thy
   goodness, though we are without understanding, we have been scourged
   for but few of our faults; Thou art terrible, and who will resist Thee?
   [3125] the mountains will tremble before Thee; and who will strive
   against the might of Thine arm?  If Thou shut the heaven, who will open
   it?  And if Thou let loose Thy torrents, who will restrain them?  It is
   a light thing in Thine eyes to make poor and to make rich, to make
   alive and to kill, to strike and to heal, and Thy will is perfect
   action.  Thou art angry, and we have sinned, [3126] says one of old,
   making confession; and it is now time for me to say the opposite, "We
   have sinned, and Thou art angry:"  therefore have we become a reproach
   to our neighbours. [3127]   Thou didst turn Thy face from us, and we
   were filled with dishonour.  But stay, Lord, cease, Lord, forgive,
   Lord, deliver us not up for ever because of our iniquities, and let not
   our chastisements be a warning for others, when we might learn wisdom
   from the trials of others.  Of whom?  Of the nations which know Thee
   not, and kingdoms which have not been subject to Thy power.  But we are
   Thy people, [3128] O Lord, the rod of Thine inheritance; therefore
   correct us, but in goodness and not in Thine anger, lest Thou bring us
   to nothingness [3129] and contempt among all that dwell on the earth.

   13.  With these words I invoke mercy:  and if it were possible to
   propitiate His wrath with whole burnt offerings or sacrifices, I would
   not even have spared these.  Do you also yourselves imitate your
   trembling priest, you, my beloved children, sharers with me alike of
   the Divine correction and loving-kindness.  Possess your souls in
   tears, and stay His wrath by amending your way of life.  Sanctify a
   fast, call a solemn assembly, [3130] as blessed Joel with us charges
   you:  gather the elders, and the babes that suck the breasts, whose
   tender age wins our pity, and is specially worthy of the
   loving-kindness of God.  I know also what he enjoins both upon me, the
   minister of God, and upon you, who have been thought worthy of the same
   honour, that we should enter His house in sackcloth and lament night
   and day between the porch and the altar, in piteous array, and with
   more piteous voices, crying aloud without ceasing on behalf of
   ourselves and the people, sparing nothing, either toil or word, which
   may propitiate God:  saying "Spare, O Lord, Thy people, and give not
   Thine heritage to reproach," [3131] and the rest of the prayer;
   surpassing the people in our sense of the affliction as much as in our
   rank, instructing them in our own persons in compunction and correction
   of wickedness, and in the consequent long-suffering of God, and
   cessation of the scourge.

   14.  Come then, all of you, my brethren, let us worship and fall down,
   and weep before the Lord our Maker; [3132] let us appoint a public
   mourning, in our various ages and families, let us raise the voice of
   supplication; and let this, instead of the cry which He hates, enter
   into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.  Let us anticipate His anger by
   confession; [3133] let us desire to see Him appeased, after He was
   wroth.  Who knoweth, he says, if He will turn and repent, and leave a
   blessing behind Him? [3134]   This I know certainly, I the sponsor of
   the loving-kindness of God.  And when He has laid aside that which is
   unnatural to Him, His anger, He will betake Himself to that which is
   natural, His mercy.  To the one He is forced by us, to the other He is
   inclined.  And if He is forced to strike, surely He will refrain,
   according to His Nature.  Only let us have mercy on ourselves, and open
   a road for our Father's righteous affections.  Let us sow in tears,
   that we may reap in joy, [3135] let us show ourselves men of Nineveh,
   not of Sodom. [3136]   Let us amend our wickedness, lest we be consumed
   with it; let us listen to the preaching of Jonah, lest we be
   overwhelmed by fire and brimstone, and if we have departed from Sodom
   let us escape to the mountain, let us flee to Zoar, let us enter it as
   the sun rises; let us not stay in all the plain, let us not look around
   us, lest we be frozen into a pillar of salt, a really immortal pillar,
   to accuse the soul which returns to wickedness.

   15.  Let us be assured that to do no wrong [3137] is really superhuman,
   and belongs to God alone.  I say nothing about the Angels, that we may
   give no room for wrong feelings, nor opportunity for harmful
   altercations.  Our unhealed condition arises from our evil and
   unsubdued nature, and from the exercise of its powers.  Our repentance
   when we sin, is a human action, but an action which bespeaks a good
   man, belonging to that portion which is in the way of salvation.  For
   if even our dust contracts somewhat of wickedness, and the earthly
   tabernacle presseth down the upward flight of the soul, [3138] which at
   least was created to fly upward, yet let the image be cleansed from
   filth, and raise aloft the flesh, its yoke-fellow, lifting it on the
   wings of reason; and, what is better, let us neither need this
   cleansing, nor have to be cleansed, by preserving our original dignity,
   to which we are hastening through our training here, and let us not by
   the bitter taste of sin be banished from the tree of life:  though it
   is better to turn again when we err, than to be free from correction
   when we stumble.  For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, [3139] and a
   rebuke is a fatherly action; while every soul which is unchastised, is
   unhealed.  Is not then freedom from chastisement a hard thing?  But to
   fail to be corrected by the chastisement is still harder.  One of the
   prophets, speaking of Israel, whose heart was hard and uncircumcised,
   says, Lord, Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved, Thou
   hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction; [3140]
   and again, The people turned not to Him that smiteth them; [3141] and
   Why is my people slidden back by a perpetual backsliding, [3142]
   because of which it will be utterly crushed and destroyed?

   16.  It is a fearful thing, my brethren, to fall into the hands of a
   living God, [3143] and fearful is the face of the Lord against them
   that do evil, [3144] and abolishing wickedness with utter destruction.
   Fearful is the ear of God, listening even to the voice of Abel speaking
   through his silent blood.  Fearful His feet, which overtake evildoing.
   Fearful also His filling of the universe, so that it is impossible
   anywhere to escape the action of God, [3145] not even by flying up to
   heaven, or entering Hades, or by escaping to the far East, or
   concealing ourselves in the depths and ends of the sea. [3146]   Nahum
   the Elkoshite was afraid before me, when he proclaimed the burden of
   Nineveh, God is jealous, and the Lord takes vengeance in wrath upon His
   adversaries, [3147] and uses such abundance of severity that no room is
   left for further vengeance upon the wicked.  For whenever I hear Isaiah
   threaten the people of Sodom and rulers of Gomorrah, [3148] and say Why
   will ye be smitten any more, adding sin to sin? [3149]   I am almost
   filled with horror, and melted to tears.  It is impossible, he says, to
   find any blow to add to those which are past, because of your newly
   added sins; so completely have you run through the whole, and exhausted
   every form of chastisement, ever calling upon yourselves some new one
   by your wickedness.  There is not a wound, nor bruise, nor putrefying
   sore; [3150] the plague affects the whole body and is incurable:  for
   it is impossible to apply a plaster, or ointment or bandages.  I pass
   over the rest of the threatenings, that I may not press upon you more
   heavily than your present plague.

   17.  Only let us recognise the purpose of the evil.  Why have the crops
   withered, our storehouses been emptied, the pastures of our flocks
   failed, the fruits of the earth been withheld, and the plains been
   filled with shame instead of with fatness:  why have valleys lamented
   and not abounded in corn, the mountains not dropped sweetness, as they
   shall do hereafter to the righteous, but been stript and dishonoured,
   and received on the contrary the curse of Gilboa? [3151]   The whole
   earth has become as it was in the beginning, before it was adorned with
   its beauties.  Thou visitedst the earth, and madest it to drink [3152]
   --but the visitation has been for evil, and the draught destructive.
   Alas! what a spectacle!  Our prolific crops reduced to stubble, the
   seed we sowed is recognised by scanty remains, and our harvest, the
   approach of which we reckon from the number of the months, instead of
   from the ripening corn, scarcely bears the firstfruits for the Lord.
   Such is the wealth of the ungodly, such the harvest of the careless
   sower; as the ancient curse runs, to look for much, and bring in
   little, [3153] to sow and not reap, to plant and not press, [3154] ten
   acres of vineyard to yield one bath: [3155]   and to hear of fertile
   harvests in other lands, and be ourselves pressed by famine.  Why is
   this, and what is the cause of the breach?  Let us not wait to be
   convicted by others, let us be our own examiners.  An important
   medicine for evil is confession, and care to avoid stumbling. I will be
   first to do so, as I have made my report to my people from on high, and
   performed the duty of a watcher. [3156]   For I did not conceal the
   coming of the sword that I might save my own soul [3157] and those of
   my hearers.  So will I now announce the disobedience of my people,
   making what is theirs my own, if I may perchance thus obtain some
   tenderness and relief.

   18.  One of us has oppressed the poor, and wrested from him his portion
   of land, and wrongly encroached upon his landmark by fraud or violence,
   and joined house to house, and field to field, to rob his neighbour of
   something, and been eager to have no neighbour, so as to dwell alone on
   the earth. [3158]   Another has defiled the land with usury and
   interest, both gathering where he had not sowed and reaping where he
   had not strawed, [3159] farming, not the land, but the necessity of the
   needy.  Another has robbed God, [3160] the giver of all, of the
   firstfruits of the barnfloor and winepress, showing himself at once
   thankless and senseless, in neither giving thanks for what he has had,
   nor prudently providing, at least, for the future.  Another has had no
   pity on the widow and orphan, and not imparted his bread and meagre
   nourishment to the needy, or rather to Christ, Who is nourished in the
   persons of those who are nourished even in a slight degree; a man
   perhaps of much property unexpectedly gained, for this is the most
   unjust of all, who finds his many barns too narrow for him, filling
   some and emptying others, to build greater [3161] ones for future
   crops, not knowing that he is being snatched away with hopes
   unrealised, to give an account of his riches and fancies, and proved to
   have been a bad steward of another's goods.  Another has turned aside
   the way of the meek, [3162] and turned aside the just among the unjust;
   another has hated him that reproveth in the gates, [3163] and abhorred
   him that speaketh uprightly; [3164] another has sacrificed to his net
   which catches much, [3165] and keeping the spoil of the poor in his
   house, [3166] has either remembered not God, or remembered Him ill--by
   saying "Blessed be the Lord, for we are rich," [3167] and wickedly
   supposed that he received these things from Him by Whom he will be
   punished.  For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the
   children of disobedience. [3168]   Because of these things the heaven
   is shut, or opened for our punishment; and much more, if we do not
   repent, even when smitten, and draw near to Him, Who approaches us
   through the powers of nature.

   19.  What shall be said to this by those of us who are buyers and
   sellers of corn, and watch the hardships of the seasons, in order to
   grow prosperous, and luxuriate in the misfortunes of others, and
   acquire, not, like Joseph, the property of the Egyptians, [3169] as a
   part of a wide policy, (for he could both collect and supply corn duly,
   as he also could foresee the famine, and provide against it afar off,)
   but the property of their fellow countrymen in an illegal manner, for
   they say, "When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell, and the
   sabbaths, that we may open our stores?" [3170]   And they corrupt
   justice with divers measures and balances, [3171] and draw upon
   themselves the ephah of lead. [3172]   What shall we say to these
   things who know no limit to our getting, who worship gold and silver,
   as those of old worshipped Baal, and Astarte and the abomination
   Chemosh? [3173]   Who give heed to the brilliance of costly stones, and
   soft flowing garments, the prey of moths, and the plunder of robbers
   and tyrants and thieves; who are proud of their multitude of slaves and
   animals, and spread themselves over plains and mountains, with their
   possessions and gains and schemes, like Solomon's horseleach [3174]
   which cannot be satisfied, any more than the grave, and the earth, and
   fire, and water; who seek for another world for their possession, and
   find fault with the bounds of God, as too small for their insatiable
   cupidity?  What of those who sit on lofty thrones and raise the stage
   of government, with a brow loftier than that of the theatre, taking no
   account of the God over all, and the height of the true kingdom that
   none can approach unto, so as to rule their subjects as
   fellow-servants, as needing themselves no less loving-kindness?  Look
   also, I pray you, at those who stretch themselves upon beds of ivory,
   whom the divine Amos fitly upbraids, who anoint themselves with the
   chief ointments, and chant to the sound of instruments of music, and
   attach themselves to transitory things as though they were stable, but
   have not grieved nor had compassion for the affliction of Joseph;
   [3175] though they ought to have been kind to those who had met with
   disaster before them, and by mercy have obtained mercy; as the fir-tree
   should howl, because the cedar had fallen, [3176] and be instructed by
   their neighbours' chastisement, and be led by others' ills to regulate
   their own lives, having the advantage of being saved by their
   predecessors' fate, instead of being themselves a warning to others.

   20.  Join with us, thou divine and sacred person, in considering these
   questions, with the store of experience, that source of wisdom, which
   thou hast gathered in thy long life.  Herewith instruct thy people.
   Teach them to break their bread to the hungry, to gather together the
   poor that have no shelter, to cover their nakedness and not neglect
   those of the same blood, [3177] and now especially that we may gain a
   benefit from our need instead of from abundance, a result which pleases
   God more than plentiful offerings and large gifts.  After this, nay
   before it, show thyself, I pray, a Moses, [3178] or Phinehas [3179]
   to-day.  Stand on our behalf and make atonement, and let the plague be
   stayed, either by the spiritual sacrifice, [3180] or by prayer and
   reasonable intercession. [3181]   Restrain the anger of the Lord by thy
   mediation:  avert any succeeding blows of the scourge.  He knoweth to
   respect the hoar hairs of a father interceding for his children.
   Intreat for our past wickedness:  be our surety for the future.
   Present a people purified by suffering and fear.  Beg for bodily
   sustenance, but beg rather for the angels' food that cometh down from
   heaven.  So doing, thou wilt make God to be our God, wilt conciliate
   heaven, wilt restore the former and latter rain: [3182] the Lord shall
   show loving-kindness [3183] and our land shall yield her fruit; [3184]
   our earthly land its fruit which lasts for the day, and our frame,
   which is but dust, the fruit which is eternal, which we shall store up
   in the heavenly winepresses by thy hands, who presentest both us and
   ours in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory for evermore.  Amen.

   Oration XVIII.

   On the Death of his Father.

   ThisOration was delivered a.d. 374.  S. Gregory the elder died early in
   that year, according to the Greek Menæa on the 1st of January, though
   Clémencet and some others place his death a few months later.  His
   wife, S. Nonna, survived him, and was present to hear the Oration, as
   was also S. Basil, who desired to honour one who had consecrated him to
   the Episcopate.  The aged Saint, who died in his hundredth year, had
   originally belonged to a sect called Hypsistarii.  Our knowledge of the
   existence and tenets of this sect is due to this Oration [3185] and to
   a few sentences in that of S. Greg. Nyssen. (c. Eunom. I. ed. 1615, p.
   12), by whom they are called Hypsistians.  He was converted by the
   prayers, influence and example of his wife, S. Nonna, and, soon after
   his baptism, consecrated Bishop of Nazianzus.  He was eminent as an
   able administrator, a devout Christian, an orthodox teacher, a
   steadfast Confessor of the faith, a sympathetic Pastor, an affectionate
   father.  In his life and work he was seconded by his wife, and followed
   by his three children, Gregory, Gorgonia, and Cæsarius, whose names are
   all to be found upon the roll of the Saints.

   Funeral Oration on His Father, in the Presence of S. Basil.

   1.  O man of God, [3186] and faithful servant, [3187] and steward of
   the mysteries of God, [3188] and man of desires [3189] of the Spirit:
   [3190]   for thus Scripture speaks of men advanced and lofty, superior
   to visible things.  I will call you also a God to Pharaoh [3191] and
   all the Egyptian and hostile power, and pillar and ground of the Church
   [3192] and will of God [3193] and light in the world, holding forth the
   word of life, [3194] and prop of the faith and resting place of the
   Spirit.  But why should I enumerate all the titles which your virtue,
   in its varied forms, has won for and applied to you as your own?

   2.  Tell me, however, whence do you come, what is your business, and
   what favour do you bring us?  Since I know that you are entirely moved
   with and by God, and for the benefit of those who receive you.  Are you
   come to inspect us, or to seek for the pastor, or to take the oversight
   of the flock?  You find us no longer in existence, but for the most
   part having passed away with him, unable to bear with the place of our
   affliction, especially now that we have lost our skilful steersman, our
   light of life, to whom we looked to direct our course as the blazing
   beacon of salvation above us:  he has departed with all his excellence,
   and all the power of pastoral organization, which he had gathered in a
   long time, full of days and wisdom, and crowned, to use the words of
   Solomon, with the hoary head of glory. [3195]   His flock is desolate
   and downcast, filled, as you see, with despondency and dejection, no
   longer reposing in the green pasture, [3196] and reared up by the water
   of comfort, but seeking precipices, deserts and pits, in which it will
   be scattered and perish; [3197] in despair of ever obtaining another
   wise pastor, absolutely persuaded that it cannot find such an one as
   he, content if it be one who will not be far inferior.

   3.  There are, as I said, three causes to necessitate your presence,
   all of equal weight, ourselves, the pastor, and the flock:  come then,
   and according to the spirit of ministry which is in you, assign to each
   its due, and guide your words in judgment, so that we may more than
   ever marvel at your wisdom.  And how will you guide them?  First by
   bestowing seemly praise upon his virtue, not only as a pure sepulchral
   tribute of speech to him who was pure, but also to set forth to others
   his conduct and example as a mark of true piety.  Then bestow upon us
   some brief counsels concerning life and death, and the union and
   severance of body and soul, and the two worlds, the one present but
   transitory, the other spiritually perceived and abiding; and persuade
   us to despise that which is deceitful and disordered and uneven,
   carrying us and being carried, like the waves, now up, now down; but to
   cling to that which is firm and stable and divine and constant, free
   from all disturbance and confusion.  For this would lessen our pain
   because of friends departed before us, nay we should rejoice if your
   words should carry us hence and set us on high, and hide distress of
   the present in the future, and persuade us that we also are pressing on
   to a good Master, and that our home is better than our pilgrimage; and
   that translation and removal thither is to us who are tempest-tost here
   like a calm haven to men at sea; or as ease and relief from toil come
   to men who, at the close of a long journey, escape the troubles of the
   wayfarer, so to those who attain to the hostel yonder comes a better
   and more tolerable existence than that of those who still tread the
   crooked and precipitous path of this life.

   4.  Thus might you console us; but what of the flock?  Would you first
   promise the oversight and leadership of yourself, a man under whose
   wings we all would gladly repose, and for whose words we thirst more
   eagerly than men suffering from thirst for the purest fountain?
   Secondly, persuade us that the good shepherd who laid down his life for
   the sheep [3198] has not even now left us; but is present, and tends
   and guides, and knows his own, and is known of his own, and, though
   bodily invisible, is spiritually recognized, and defends his flock
   against the wolves, and allows no one to climb over into the fold as a
   robber and traitor; to pervert and steal away, by the voice of
   strangers, souls under the fair guidance of the truth.  Aye, I am well
   assured that his intercession is of more avail now than was his
   instruction in former days, since he is closer to God, now that he has
   shaken off his bodily fetters, and freed his mind from the clay which
   obscured it, and holds intercourse naked with the nakedness of the
   prime and purest Mind; being promoted, if it be not rash to say so, to
   the rank and confidence of an angel.  This, with your power of speech
   and spirit, you will set forth and discuss better than I can sketch
   it.  But in order that, through ignorance of his excellences, your
   language may not fall very far short of his deserts, I will, from my
   own knowledge of the departed, briefly draw an outline, and preliminary
   plan of an eulogy to be handed to you, the illustrious artist of such
   subjects, for the details of the beauty of his virtue to be filled in
   and transmitted to the ears and minds of all.

   5.  Leaving to the laws of panegyric the description of his country,
   his family, his nobility of figure, his external magnificence, and the
   other subjects of human pride, I begin with what is of most consequence
   and comes closest to ourselves.  He sprang from a stock unrenowned, and
   not well suited for piety, for I am not ashamed of his origin, in my
   confidence in the close of his life, one that was not planted in the
   house of God, [3199] but far removed and estranged, the combined
   product of two of the greatest opposites--Greek error and legal
   imposture, some parts of each of which it escaped, of others it was
   compounded.  For, on the one side, they reject idols and sacrifices,
   but reverence fire and lights; on the other, they observe the Sabbath
   and petty regulations as to certain meats, but despise circumcision.
   These lowly men call themselves Hypsistarii, and the Almighty is, so
   they say, the only object of their worship.  What was the result of
   this double tendency to impiety?  I know not whether to praise more
   highly the grace which called him, or his own purpose.  However, he so
   purged the eye of his mind from the humours [3200] which obscured it,
   and ran towards the truth with such speed that he endured the loss of
   his mother and his property for a while, for the sake of his heavenly
   Father and the true inheritance:  and submitted more readily to this
   dishonour, than others to the greatest honours, and, most wonderful as
   this is, I wonder at it but little.  Why?  Because this glory is common
   to him with many others, and all must come into the great net of God,
   and be caught by the words of the fishers, although some are earlier,
   some later, enclosed by the Gospel.  But what does especially in his
   life move my wonder, it is needful for me to mention.

   6.  Even before he was of our fold, he was ours.  His character made
   him one of us.  For, as many of our own are not with us, whose life
   alienates them from the common body, so, many of those without are on
   our side, whose character anticipates their faith, and need only the
   name of that which indeed they possess.  My father was one of these, an
   alien shoot, but inclined by his life towards us.  He was so far
   advanced in self control, that he became at once most beloved and most
   modest, two qualities difficult to combine.  What greater and more
   splendid testimony can there be to his justice than his exercise of a
   position second to none in the state, without enriching himself by a
   single farthing, although he saw everyone else casting the hands of
   Briareus upon the public funds, and swollen with ill-gotten gain?  For
   thus do I term unrighteous wealth.  Of his prudence this also is no
   slight proof, but in the course of my speech further details will be
   given.  It was as a reward [3201] for such conduct, I think, that he
   attained to the faith.  How this came about, a matter too important to
   be passed over, I would now set forth.

   7.  I have heard the Scripture say:  Who can find a valiant woman?
   [3202] and declare that she is a divine gift, and that a good marriage
   is brought about by the Lord.  Even those without are of the same mind;
   if they say that a man can win no fairer prize than a good wife, nor a
   worse one than her opposite. [3203]   But we can mention none who has
   been in this respect more fortunate than he.  For I think that, had
   anyone from the ends of the earth and from every race of men attempted
   to bring about the best of marriages, he could not have found a better
   or more harmonious one than this.  For the most excellent of men and of
   women were so united that their marriage was a union of virtue rather
   than of bodies:  since, while they excelled all others, they could not
   excel each other, because in virtue they were quite equally matched.

   8.  She indeed who was given to Adam as a help meet for him, because it
   was not good for man to be alone, [3204] instead of an assistant became
   an enemy, and instead of a yoke-fellow, an opponent, and beguiling the
   man by means of pleasure, estranged him through the tree of knowledge
   from the tree of life.  But she who was given by God to my father
   became not only, as is less wonderful, his assistant, but even his
   leader, drawing him on by her influence in deed and word to the highest
   excellence; judging it best in all other respects to be overruled by
   her husband according to the law of marriage, but not being ashamed, in
   regard of piety, even to offer herself as his teacher.  Admirable
   indeed as was this conduct of hers, it was still more admirable that he
   should readily acquiesce in it.  She is a woman who while others have
   been honoured and extolled for natural and artificial beauty, has
   acknowledged but one kind of beauty, that of the soul, and the
   preservation, or the restoration as far as possible, of the Divine
   image.  Pigments and devices for adornment she has rejected as worthy
   of women on the stage.  The only genuine form of noble birth she
   recognized is piety, and the knowledge of whence we are sprung and
   whither we are tending.  The only safe and inviolable form of wealth
   is, she considered, to strip oneself of wealth for God and the poor,
   and especially for those of our own kin who are unfortunate; and such
   help only as is necessary, she held to be rather a reminder, than a
   relief of their distress, while a more liberal beneficence brings
   stable honour and most perfect consolation.  Some women have excelled
   in thrifty management, others in piety, while she, difficult as it is
   to unite the two virtues, has surpassed all in both of them, both by
   her eminence in each, and by the fact that she alone has combined them
   together.  To as great a degree has she, by her care and skill, secured
   the prosperity of her household, according to the injunctions and laws
   of Solomon as to the valiant woman, as if she had had no knowledge of
   piety; and she applied herself to God and Divine things as closely as
   if absolutely released from household cares, allowing neither branch of
   her duty to interfere with the other, but rather making each of them
   support the other.

   9.  What time or place for prayer ever escaped her?  To this she was
   drawn before all other things in the day; or rather, who had such hope
   of receiving an immediate answer to her requests?  Who paid such
   reverence to the hand and countenance of the priests?  Or honoured all
   kinds of philosophy?  Who reduced the flesh by more constant fast and
   vigil?  Or stood like a pillar at the night long and daily psalmody?
   Who had a greater love for virginity, though patient of the marriage
   bond herself?  Who was a better patron of the orphan and the widow?
   Who aided as much in the alleviation of the misfortunes of the
   mourner?  These things, small as they are, and perhaps contemptible in
   the eyes of some, because not easily attainable by most people (for
   that which is unattainable comes, through envy, to be thought not even
   credible), are in my eyes most honourable, since they were the
   discoveries of her faith and the undertakings of her spiritual
   fervour.  So also in the holy assemblies, or places, her voice was
   never to be heard except [3205] in the necessary responses of the
   service.

   10.  And if it was a great thing for the altar never to have had an
   iron tool lifted upon it, [3206] and that no chisel should be seen or
   heard, with greater reason, since everything dedicated to God ought to
   be natural and free from artificiality, it was also surely a great
   thing that she reverenced the sanctuary by her silence; that she never
   turned her back to the venerable table, nor spat upon the divine
   pavement; that she never grasped the hand or kissed the lips of any
   heathen woman, however honourable in other respects, or closely related
   she might be; nor would she ever share the salt, I say not willingly
   but even under compulsion, of those who came from the profane and
   unholy table; nor could she bear, against the law of conscience, to
   pass by or look upon a polluted house; nor to have her ears or tongue,
   which had received and uttered divine things, defiled by Grecian tales
   or theatrical songs, on the ground that what is unholy is unbecoming to
   holy things; and what is still more wonderful, she never so far yielded
   to the external signs of grief, although greatly moved even by the
   misfortunes of strangers, as to allow a sound of woe to burst forth
   before the Eucharist, or a tear to fall from the eye mystically sealed,
   or any trace of mourning to be left on the occasion of a festival,
   however frequent her own sorrows might be; inasmuch as the God-loving
   soul should subject every human experience to the things of God.

   11.  I pass by in silence what is still more ineffable, of which God is
   witness, and those of the faithful handmaidens to whom she has confided
   such things.  That which concerns myself is perhaps undeserving of
   mention, since I have proved unworthy of the hope cherished in regard
   to me:  yet it was on her part a great undertaking to promise me to God
   before my birth, with no fear of the future, and to dedicate me
   immediately after I was born.  Through God's goodness has it been that
   she has not utterly failed in her prayer, and that the auspicious
   sacrifice was not rejected.  Some of these things were already in
   existence, others were in the future, growing up by means of gradual
   additions.  And as the sun which most pleasantly casts its morning
   rays, becomes at midday hotter and more brilliant, so also did she, who
   from the first gave no slight evidence of piety, shine forth at last
   with fuller light.  Then indeed he, who had established her in his
   house, had at home no slight spur to piety, possessed, by her origin
   and descent, of the love of God and Christ, and having received virtue
   as her patrimony; not, as he had been, cut out of the wild olive and
   grafted into the good olive, yet unable to bear, in the excess of her
   faith, to be unequally yoked; for, though surpassing all others in
   endurance and fortitude, she could not brook this, the being but half
   united to God, because of the estrangement of him who was a part of
   herself, and the failure to add to the bodily union, a close connexion
   in the spirit:  on this account, she fell before God night and day,
   entreating for the salvation of her head with many fastings and tears,
   and assiduously devoting herself to her husband, and influencing him in
   many ways, by means of reproaches, admonitions, attentions,
   estrangements, and above all by her own character with its fervour for
   piety, by which the soul is specially prevailed upon and softened, and
   willingly submits to virtuous pressure.  The drop [3207] of water
   constantly striking the rock was destined to hollow it, and at length
   attain its longing, as the sequel shows.

   12.  These were the objects of her prayers and hopes, in the fervour of
   faith rather than of youth.  Indeed, none was as confident of things
   present as she of things hoped for, from her experience of the
   generosity of God.  For the salvation of my father there was a
   concurrence of the gradual conviction [3208] of his reason, and the
   vision of dreams which God often bestows upon a soul worthy of
   salvation.  What was the vision?  This is to me the most pleasing part
   of the story.  He thought that he was singing, as he had never done
   before, though his wife was frequent in her supplications and prayers,
   this verse from the psalms of holy David:  I was glad when they said
   unto me, we will go into the house of the Lord. [3209]   The psalm was
   a strange one to him, and along with its words the desire came to him.
   As soon as she heard it, having thus obtained her prayer, she seized
   the opportunity, replying that the vision would bring the greatest
   pleasure, if accompanied by its fulfilment, and, manifesting by her joy
   the greatness of the benefit, she urged forward his salvation, before
   anything could intervene to hinder the call, and dissipate the object
   of her longing.  At that very time it happened that a number of Bishops
   were hastening to Nicæa, to oppose the madness of Arius, since the
   wickedness of dividing the Godhead had just arisen; so my father
   yielded himself to God and to the heralds of the truth, and confessed
   his desire, and requested from them the common salvation, one of them
   being the celebrated Leontius, at that time our own metropolitan.  It
   would be a great wrong to grace, were I to pass by in silence the
   wonder which then was bestowed upon him by grace.  The witnesses of the
   wonder [3210] are not few.  The teachers of accuracy were spiritually
   at fault, and the grace was a forecast of the future, and the formula
   of the priesthood was mingled with the admission of the catechumen.  O
   involuntary initiation! bending his knee, he received the form of
   admission to the state of a catechumen in such wise, that many, not
   only of the highest, but even of the lowest, intellect, prophesied the
   future, being assured by no indistinct signs of what was to be.

   13.  After a short interval, wonder succeeded wonder.  I will commend
   the account of it to the ears of the faithful, for to profane minds
   nothing that is good is trustworthy.  He was approaching that
   regeneration by water and the Spirit, by which we confess to God the
   formation and completion of the Christlike man, and the transformation
   and reformation from the earthy to the Spirit.  He was approaching the
   laver with warm desire and bright hope, after all the purgation
   possible, and a far greater purification of soul and body than that of
   the men who were to receive the tables from Moses.  Their purification
   extended only to their dress, and a slight restriction of the belly,
   and a temporary continence. [3211]   The whole of his past life had
   been a preparation for the enlightenment, and a preliminary
   purification making sure the gift, in order that perfection might be
   entrusted to purity, and that the blessing might incur no risk in a
   soul which was confident in its possession of the grace.  And as he was
   ascending out of the water, there flashed around him a light and a
   glory worthy of the disposition with which he approached the gift of
   faith; [3212] this was manifest even to some others, who for the time
   concealed the wonder, from fear of speaking of a sight which each one
   thought had been only his own, but shortly afterwards communicated it
   to one another.  To the baptiser [3213] and initiator, however, it was
   so clear and visible, that he could not even hold back the mystery, but
   publicly cried out that he was anointing with the Spirit his own
   successor.

   14.  Nor indeed would anyone disbelieve this who has heard and knows
   that Moses, when little in the eyes of men, and not yet of any account,
   was called from the bush which burned but was not consumed, or rather
   by Him who appeared in the bush, [3214] and was encouraged by that
   first wonder:  Moses, I say, for whom the sea was divided, [3215] and
   manna rained down, [3216] and the rock poured out a fountain, [3217]
   and the pillar of fire and cloud led the way in turn, and the
   stretching out of his hands gained a victory, and the representation of
   the cross overcame tens of thousands.  Isaiah, again, who beheld the
   glory of the Seraphim, [3218] and after him Jeremiah, who was entrusted
   with great power against nations and kings; [3219] the one heard the
   divine voice and was cleansed by a live coal for his prophetic office,
   and the other was known before his formation and sanctified before his
   birth.  Paul, also, while yet a persecutor, who became the great herald
   of the truth and teacher of the Gentiles in faith, [3220] was
   surrounded by a light [3221] and acknowledged Him whom he was
   persecuting, and was entrusted with his great ministry, and filled
   every ear and mind with the gospel.

   15.  Why need I count up all those who have been called to Himself by
   God and associated with such wonders as confirmed him in his piety?
   Nor was it the case that after such and so incredible and startling
   beginnings, any of the former things was put to shame by his subsequent
   conduct, as happens with those who very soon acquire a distaste for
   what is good, and so neglect all further progress, if they do not
   utterly relapse into vice.  This cannot be said of him, for he was most
   consistent with himself and his early days, and kept in harmony his
   life before the priesthood with its excellence, and his life after it
   with what had gone before, since it would have been unbecoming to begin
   in one way and end in another, or to advance to a different end from
   that which he had in view at first.  He was next entrusted with the
   priesthood, not with the facility and disorder of the present day, but
   after a brief interval, in order to add to his own cleansing the skill
   and power to cleanse others; for this is the law of spiritual
   sequence.  And when he had been entrusted with it, the grace was the
   more glorified, being really the grace of God, and not of men, and not,
   as the preacher [3222] says, an independent impulse and purpose [3223]
   of spirit.

   16.  He received a woodland and rustic church, the pastoral care and
   oversight of which had not been bestowed from a distance, but it had
   been cared for by one of his predecessors of admirable and angelic
   disposition, and a more simple man than our present rulers of the
   people; but, after he had been speedily taken to God, it had, in
   consequence of the loss of its leader, for the most part grown careless
   and run wild; accordingly, he at first strove without harshness to
   soften the habits of the people, both by words of pastoral knowledge,
   and by setting himself before them as an example, like a spiritual
   statue, polished into the beauty of all excellent conduct.  He next, by
   constant meditation on the divine words, though a late student of such
   matters, gathered together so much wisdom within a short time that he
   was in no wise excelled by those who had spent the greatest toil upon
   them, and received this special grace from God, that he became the
   father and teacher of orthodoxy--not, like our modern wise men,
   yielding to the spirit of the age, nor defending our faith by
   indefinite and sophistical language, as if they had no fixity of faith,
   or were adulterating the truth; but, he was more pious than those who
   possessed rhetorical power, more skilled in rhetoric than those who
   were upright in mind; or rather, while he took the second place as an
   orator, he surpassed all in piety.  He acknowledged One God worshipped
   in Trinity, and Three, Who are united in One Godhead; neither
   Sabellianising [3224] as to the One, nor Arianising as to the Three;
   either by contracting and so atheistically annihilating the Godhead, or
   by tearing It asunder by distinctions of unequal greatness or nature.
   For, seeing that Its every quality is incomprehensible and beyond the
   power of our intellect, how can we either perceive or express by
   definition on such a subject, that which is beyond our ken?  How can
   the immeasurable be measured, and the Godhead be reduced to the
   condition of finite things, and measured by degrees [3225] of greater
   or less?

   17.  What else must we say of this great man of God, the true Divine,
   under the influence, in regard to these subjects, of the Holy Ghost,
   but that through his perception of these points, he, like the great
   Noah, the father of this second world, made this church to be called
   the new Jerusalem, and a second ark borne up upon the waters; since it
   both surmounted the deluge of souls, and the insults of the heretics,
   and excelled all others in reputation no less than it fell behind them
   in numbers; and has had the same fortune as the sacred Bethlehem, which
   can without contradiction be at once said to be a little city and the
   metropolis of the world, since it is the nurse and mother of Christ,
   Who both made and overcame the world.

   18.  To give a proof of what I say.  When a tumult of the over-zealous
   part of the Church was raised against us, and we had been decoyed by a
   document [3226] and artful terms into association with evil, he alone
   was believed to have an unwounded mind, and a soul unstained by ink,
   even when he had been imposed upon in his simplicity, and failed from
   his guilelessness of soul to be on his guard against guile.  He it was
   alone, or rather first of all, who by his zeal for piety reconciled to
   himself and the rest of the church the faction opposed to us, which was
   the last to leave us, the first to return, owing to both their
   reverence for the man and the purity of his doctrine, so that the
   serious storm in the churches was allayed, and the hurricane reduced to
   a breeze under the influence of his prayers and admonitions; while, if
   I may make a boastful remark, I was his partner [3227] in piety and
   activity, aiding him in every effort on behalf of what is good,
   accompanying and running beside him, and being permitted on this
   occasion to contribute a very great share of the toil.  Here my account
   of these matters, which is a little premature, must come to an end.

   19.  Who could enumerate the full tale of his excellences, or, if he
   wished to pass by most of them, discover without difficulty what can be
   omitted?  For each trait, as it occurs to the mind, seems superior to
   what has gone before; it takes possession of me, and I feel more at a
   loss to know what I ought to pass by, than other panegyrists are as to
   what they ought to say.  So that the abundance of material is to some
   extent a hindrance to me, and my mind is itself put to the test in its
   efforts to test his qualities, and its inability, where all are equal,
   to find one which surpasses the rest.  So that, just as when we see a
   pebble falling into still water, it becomes the centre and
   starting-point of circle after circle, each by its continuous agitation
   breaking up that which lies outside of it; this is exactly the case
   with myself.  For as soon as one thing enters my mind, another follows
   and displaces it; and I am wearied out in making a choice, as what I
   have already grasped is ever retiring in favour of that which follows
   in its train.

   20.  Who was more anxious than he for the common weal?  Who more wise
   in domestic affairs, since God, who orders all things in due variation,
   assigned to him a house and suitable fortune?  Who was more sympathetic
   in mind, more bounteous in hand, towards the poor, that most
   dishonoured portion of the nature to which equal honour is due?  For he
   actually treated his own property as if it were another's, of which he
   was but the steward, relieving poverty as far as he could, and
   expending not only his superfluities but his necessities--a manifest
   proof of love for the poor, giving a portion, not only to seven,
   according to the injunction of Solomon, [3228] but if an eighth came
   forward, not even in his case being niggardly, but more pleased to
   dispose of his wealth than we know others are to acquire it; taking
   away the yoke and election (which means, as I think, all meanness in
   testing as to whether the recipient is worthy or not) and word of
   murmuring [3229] in benevolence.  This is what most men do:  they give
   indeed, but without that readiness, which is a greater and more perfect
   thing than the mere offering.  For he thought it much better [3230] to
   be generous even to the undeserving for the sake of the deserving, than
   from fear of the undeserving to deprive those who were deserving.  And
   this seems to be the duty of casting our bread upon the waters, [3231]
   since it will not be swept away or perish in the eyes of the just
   Investigator, but will arrive yonder where all that is ours is laid up,
   and will meet with us in due time, even though we think it not.

   21.  But what is best and greatest of all, his magnanimity was
   accompanied by freedom from ambition.  Its extent and character I will
   proceed to show.  In considering their wealth to be common to all, and
   in liberality in bestowing it, he and his consort rivalled each other
   in their struggles after excellence; but he intrusted the greater part
   of this bounty to her hand, as being a most excellent and trusty
   steward of such matters.  What a woman she is?  Not even the Atlantic
   Ocean, or if there be a greater one, could meet her drafts upon it.  So
   great and so boundless is her love of liberality.  In the contrary
   sense she has rivalled the horse-leech [3232] of Solomon, by her
   insatiable longing for progress, overcoming the tendency to
   backsliding, and unable to satisfy her zeal for benevolence.  She not
   only considered all the property which they originally possessed, and
   what accrued to them later, as unable to suffice her own longing, but
   she would, as I have often heard her say, have gladly sold herself and
   her children into slavery, had there been any means of doing so, to
   expend the proceeds upon the poor.  Thus entirely did she give the rein
   to her generosity.  This is, I imagine, far more convincing than any
   instance of it could be.  Magnanimity in regard to money may be found
   without difficulty in the case of others, whether it be dissipated in
   the public rivalries of the state, or lent to God through the poor, the
   only mode of treasuring it up for those who spend it:  but it is not
   easy to discover a man who has renounced the consequent reputation.
   For it is desire for reputation which supplies to most men their
   readiness to spend.  And where the bounty must be secret, there the
   disposition to it is less keen.

   22.  So bounteous was his hand--further details I leave to those who
   knew him, so that if anything of the kind is borne witness to in regard
   to myself, it proceeds from that fountain, and is a portion of that
   stream.  Who was more under the Divine guidance in admitting men to the
   sanctuary, [3233] or in resenting dishonour done to it, or in cleansing
   the holy table with awe from the unholy?  Who with such unbiassed
   judgment, and with the scales of justice, either decided a suit, or
   hated vice, or honoured virtue, or promoted the most excellent?  Who
   was so compassionate for the sinner, or sympathetic towards those who
   were running well?  Who better knew the right time for using the rod
   and the staff, [3234] yet relied most upon the staff?  Whose eyes were
   more upon the faithful in the land, [3235] especially upon those who,
   in the monastic and unwedded life, have despised the earth and the
   things of earth?

   23.  Who did more to rebuke pride and foster lowliness?  And that in no
   assumed or external way, as most of those who now make profession of
   virtue, and are in appearance as elegant as the most mindless women,
   who, for lack of beauty of their own, take refuge in pigments, and are,
   if I may say so, splendidly made up, uncomely in their comeliness, and
   more ugly than they originally were.  For his lowliness was no matter
   of dress, but of spiritual disposition:  nor was it expressed by a bent
   neck, or lowered voice, or downcast look, or length of beard, or
   close-shaven head, or measured gait, which can be adopted for a while,
   but are very quickly exposed, for nothing which is affected can be
   permanent.  No! he was ever most lofty in life, most lowly in mind;
   inaccessible in virtue, most accessible in intercourse.  His dress had
   in it nothing remarkable, avoiding equally magnificence and sordidness,
   while his internal brilliancy was supereminent.  The disease and
   insatiability of the belly, he, if anyone, held in check, but without
   ostentation; so that he might be kept down without being puffed up,
   from having encouraged a new vice by his pursuit of reputation.  For he
   held that doing and saying everything by which fame among externs might
   be won, is the characteristic of the politician, whose chief happiness
   is found in the present life:  but that the spiritual and Christian man
   should look to one object alone, his salvation, and think much of what
   may contribute to this, but detest as of no value what does not; and
   accordingly despise what is visible, but be occupied with interior
   perfection alone, and estimate most highly whatever promotes his own
   improvement, and attracts others through himself to that which is
   supremely good.

   24.  But what was most excellent and most characteristic, though least
   generally recognized, was his simplicity, and freedom from guile and
   resentment.  For among men of ancient and modern days, each is supposed
   to have had some special success, as each chanced to have received from
   God some particular virtue:  Job unconquered patience in misfortune,
   [3236] Moses [3237] and David [3238] meekness, Samuel prophecy, seeing
   into the future, [3239] Phineas zeal, [3240] for which he has a name,
   Peter and Paul eagerness in preaching, [3241] the sons of Zebedee
   magniloquence, whence also they were entitled Sons of thunder. [3242]
   But why should I enumerate them all, speaking as I do among those who
   know this?  Now the specially distinguishing mark of Stephen and of my
   father was the absence of malice.  For not even when in peril did
   Stephen hate his assailants, but was stoned while praying for those who
   were stoning him [3243] as a disciple of Christ, on Whose behalf he was
   allowed to suffer, and so, in his long-suffering, bearing for God a
   nobler fruit than his death:  my father, in allowing no interval
   between assault and forgiveness, so that he was almost robbed of pain
   itself by the speed of pardon.

   25.  We both believe in and hear of the dregs [3244] of the anger of
   God, the residuum of His dealings with those who deserve it:  For the
   Lord is a God of vengeance. [3245]   For although He is disposed by His
   kindness to gentleness rather than severity, yet He does not absolutely
   pardon sinners, lest they should be made worse by His goodness.  Yet my
   father kept no grudge against those who provoked him, indeed he was
   absolutely uninfluenced by anger, although in spiritual things
   exceedingly overcome by zeal:  except when he had been prepared and
   armed and set in hostile array against that which was advancing to
   injure him.  So that this sweet disposition of his would not, as the
   saying goes, have been stirred by tens of thousands.  For the wrath
   which he had was not like that of the serpent, [3246] smouldering
   within, ready to defend itself, eager to burst forth, and longing to
   strike back at once on being disturbed; but like the sting of the bee,
   which does not bring death with its stroke; while his kindness was
   superhuman.  The wheel and scourge were often threatened, and those who
   could apply them stood near; and the danger ended in being pinched on
   the ear, patted on the face, or buffeted on the temple:  thus he
   mitigated the threat.  His dress and sandals were dragged off, and the
   scoundrel was felled to the ground:  then his anger was directed not
   against his assailant, but against his eager succourer, as a minister
   of evil.  How could anyone be more conclusively proved to be good, and
   worthy to offer the gifts to God?  For often, instead of being himself
   roused, he made excuses for the man who assailed him, blushing for his
   faults as if they had been his own.

   26.  The dew would more easily resist the morning rays of the sun, than
   any remains of anger continue in him; but as soon as he had spoken, his
   indignation departed with his words, leaving behind only his love for
   what is good, and never outlasting the sun; nor did he cherish anger
   which destroys even the prudent, or show any bodily trace of vice
   within, nay, even when roused, he preserved calmness.  The result of
   this was most unusual, not that he was the only one to give rebuke, but
   the only one to be both loved and admired by those whom he reproved,
   from the victory which his goodness gained over warmth of feeling; and
   it was felt to be more serviceable to be punished by a just man than
   besmeared by a bad one, for in one case the severity becomes pleasant
   for its utility, in the other the kindliness is suspected because of
   the evil of the man's character.  But though his soul and character
   were so simple and divine, his piety nevertheless inspired the insolent
   with awe:  or rather, the cause of their respect was the simplicity
   which they despised.  For it was impossible to him to utter either
   prayer or curse without the immediate bestowal of permanent blessing or
   transient pain.  The one proceeded from his inmost soul, the other
   merely rested upon his lips as a paternal reproof.  Many indeed of
   those who had injured him incurred neither lingering requital nor, as
   the poet [3247] says, "vengeance which dogs men's steps;" but at the
   very moment of their passion they were struck and converted, came
   forward, knelt before him, and were pardoned, going away gloriously
   vanquished, and amended both by the chastisement and the forgiveness.
   Indeed, a forgiving spirit often has great saving power, checking the
   wrongdoer by the sense of shame, and bringing him back from fear to
   love, a far more secure state of mind.  In chastisement some were
   tossed by oxen oppressed by the yoke, which suddenly attacked them,
   though they had never done anything of the kind before; others were
   thrown and trampled upon by most obedient and quiet horses; others
   seized by intolerable fevers, and apparitions of their daring deeds;
   others being punished in different ways, and learning obedience from
   the things which they suffered.

   27.  Such and so remarkable being his gentleness, did he yield the palm
   to others in industry and practical virtue?  By no means.  Gentle as he
   was, he possessed, if any one did, an energy corresponding to his
   gentleness.  For although, for the most part, the two virtues of
   benevolence and severity are at variance and opposed to each other, the
   one being gentle but without practical qualities, the other practical
   but unsympathetic, in his case there was a wonderful combination of the
   two, his action being as energetic as that of a severe man, but
   combined with gentleness; while his readiness to yield seemed
   unpractical but was accompanied with energy, in his patronage, his
   freedom of speech, and every kind of official duty.  He united the
   wisdom of the serpent, in regard to evil, with the harmlessness of the
   dove, in regard to good, neither allowing the wisdom to degenerate into
   knavery, nor the simplicity into silliness, but as far as in him lay,
   he combined the two in one perfect form of virtue.  Such being his
   birth, such his exercise of the priestly office, such the reputation
   which he won at the hands of all, what wonder if he was thought worthy
   of the miracles by which God establishes true religion?

   28.  One of the wonders which concern him was that he suffered from
   sickness and bodily pain.  But what wonder is it for even holy men to
   be distressed, either for the cleansing of their clay, slight though it
   may be, or a touchstone of virtue and test of philosophy, or for the
   education of the weaker, who learn from their example to be patient
   instead of giving way under their misfortunes?  Well, he was sick, the
   time was the holy and illustrious Easter, the queen of days, the
   brilliant night which dissipates the darkness of sin, upon which with
   abundant light we keep the feast of our salvation, putting ourselves to
   death along with the Light once put to death for us, and rising again
   with Him who rose.  This was the time of his sufferings.  Of what kind
   they were, I will briefly explain.  His whole frame was on fire with an
   excessive, burning fever, his strength had failed, he was unable to
   take food, his sleep had departed from him, he was in the greatest
   distress, and agitated by palpitations.  Within his mouth, the palate
   and the whole of the upper surface was so completely and painfully
   ulcerated, that it was difficult and dangerous to swallow even water.
   The skill of physicians, the prayers, most earnest though they were, of
   his friends, and every possible attention were alike of no avail.  He
   himself in this desperate condition, while his breath came short and
   fast, had no perception of present things, but was entirely absent,
   immersed in the objects he had long desired, now made ready for him.
   We were in the temple, mingling supplications with the sacred rites,
   for, in despair of all others, we had betaken ourselves to the Great
   Physician, to the power of that night, and to the last succour, with
   the intention, shall I say, of keeping a feast, or of mourning; of
   holding festival, or paying funeral honours to one no longer here?  O
   those tears! which were shed at that time by all the people.  O voices,
   and cries, and hymns blended with the psalmody!  From the temple they
   sought the priest, from the sacred rite the celebrant, from God their
   worthy ruler, with my Miriam [3248] to lead them and strike the timbrel
   [3249] not of triumph, but of supplication; learning then for the first
   time to be put to shame by misfortune, and calling at once upon the
   people and upon God; upon the former to sympathize with her distress,
   and to be lavish of their tears, upon the latter, to listen to her
   petitions, as, with the inventive genius of suffering, she rehearsed
   before Him all His wonders of old time.

   29.  What then was the response of Him who was the God of that night
   and of the sick man?  A shudder comes over me as I proceed with my
   story.  And though you, my hearers, may shudder, do not disbelieve:
   for that would be impious, when I am the speaker, and in reference to
   him.  The time of the mystery was come, and the reverend station and
   order, when silence is kept for the solemn rites; and then he was
   raised up by Him who quickeneth the dead, and by the holy night.  At
   first he moved slightly, then more decidedly; then in a feeble and
   indistinct voice he called by name one of the servants who was in
   attendance upon him, and bade him come, and bring his clothes, and
   support him with his hand.  He came in alarm, and gladly waited upon
   him, while he, leaning upon his hand as upon a staff, imitates Moses
   upon the mount, arranges his feeble hands in prayer, and in union with,
   or on behalf of, [3250] his people eagerly celebrates the mysteries, in
   such few words as his strength allowed, but, as it seems to me, with a
   most perfect intention.  What a miracle!  In the sanctuary without a
   sanctuary, sacrificing without an altar, a priest far from the sacred
   rites:  yet all these were present to him in the power of the spirit,
   recognised by him, though unseen by those who were there.  Then, after
   adding the customary words of thanksgiving, and after blessing the
   people, he retired again to his bed, and after taking a little food,
   and enjoying a sleep, he recalled his spirit, and, his health being
   gradually recovered, on the new day [3251] of the feast, as we call the
   first Sunday after the festival of the Resurrection, he entered the
   temple and inaugurated his life which had been preserved, with the full
   complement of clergy, and offered the sacrifice of thanksgiving.  To me
   this seems no less remarkable than the miracle in the case of Hezekiah,
   [3252] who was glorified by God in his sickness and prayers with an
   extension of life, and this was signified by the return of the shadow
   of the degrees, [3253] according to the request of the king who was
   restored, whom God honoured at once by the favour and the sign,
   assuring him of the extension of his days by the extension of the day.

   30.  The same miracle occurred in the case of my mother not long
   afterwards.  I do not think it would be proper to pass by this either:
   for we shall both pay the meed of honour which is due to her, if to
   anyone at all, and gratify him, by her being associated with him in our
   recital.  She, who had always been strong and vigorous and free from
   disease all her life, was herself attacked by sickness.  In consequence
   of much distress, not to prolong my story, caused above all by
   inability to eat, her life was for many days in danger, and no remedy
   for the disease could be found.  How did God sustain her?  Not by
   raining down manna, as for Israel of old [3254] or opening the rock, in
   order to give drink to His thirsting people, [3255] or feasting her by
   means of ravens, as Elijah, [3256] or feeding her by a prophet carried
   through the air, as He did to Daniel when a-hungered in the den. [3257]
     But how?  She thought she saw me, who was her favourite, for not even
   in her dreams did she prefer any other of us, coming up to her suddenly
   at night, with a basket of pure white loaves, which I blessed and
   crossed as I was wont to do, and then fed and strengthened her, and she
   became stronger.  The nocturnal vision was a real action.  For, in
   consequence, she became more herself and of better hope, as is manifest
   by a clear and evident token.  Next morning, when I paid her an early
   visit, I saw at once that she was brighter, and when I asked, as usual,
   what kind of a night she had passed, and if she wished for anything,
   she replied, "My child, you most readily and kindly fed me, and then
   you ask how I am.  I am very well and at ease."  Her maids too made
   signs to me to offer no resistance, and to accept her answer at once,
   lest she should be thrown back into despondency, if the truth were laid
   bare.  I will add one more instance common to them both.

   31.  I was on a voyage from Alexandria to Greece over the Parthenian
   Sea.  The voyage was quite unseasonable, undertaken in an Æginetan
   vessel, under the impulse of eager desire; for what specially induced
   me was that I had fallen in with a crew who were well known to me.
   After making some way on the voyage, a terrible storm came upon us, and
   such an one as my shipmates said they had but seldom seen before.
   While we were all in fear of a common death, spiritual death was what I
   was most afraid of; for I was in danger of departing in misery, being
   unbaptised, and I longed for the spiritual water among the waters of
   death.  On this account I cried and begged and besought a slight
   respite.  My shipmates, even in their common danger, joined in my
   cries, as not even my own relatives would have done, kindly souls as
   they were, having learned sympathy from their dangers.  In this my
   condition, my parents felt for me, my danger having been communicated
   to them by a nightly vision, and they aided me from the land, soothing
   the waves by prayer, as I afterwards learned by calculating the time,
   after I had landed.  This was also shown me in a wholesome sleep, of
   which I had experience during a slight lull of the tempest.  I seemed
   to be holding a Fury, of fearful aspect, boding danger; for the night
   presented her clearly to my eyes.  Another of my shipmates, a boy most
   kindly disposed and dear to me, and exceedingly anxious on my behalf,
   in my then present condition, thought he saw my mother walk upon the
   sea, and seize and drag the ship to land with no great exertion.  We
   had confidence in the vision, for the sea began to grow calm, and we
   soon reached Rhodes after the intervention of no great discomfort.  We
   ourselves became an offering in consequence of that peril; for we
   promised ourselves if we were saved, to God, and, when we had been
   saved, gave ourselves to Him.

   32.  Such were their common experiences.  But I imagine that some of
   those who have had an accurate knowledge of his life must have been for
   a long while wondering why we have dwelt upon these points, as if we
   thought them his only title to renown, and postponed the mention of the
   difficulties of his times, against which he conspicuously arrayed
   himself, as though we were either ignorant of them, or thought them to
   be of no great consequence.  Come, then, we will proceed to speak upon
   this topic.  The first, and I think the last, evil of our day, was the
   Emperor who apostatised from God and from reason, and thought it a
   small matter to conquer the Persians, but a great one to subject to
   himself the Christians; and so, together with the demons who led and
   prevailed upon him, he failed in no form of impiety, but by means of
   persuasions, threats, and sophistries, strove to draw men to him, and
   even added to his various artifices the use of force.  His design,
   however, was exposed, whether he strove to conceal persecution under
   sophistical devices, or manifestly made use of his authority--namely by
   one means or the other--either by cozening or by violence, to get us
   into his power.  Who can be found who more utterly despised or defeated
   him?  One sign, among many others, of his contempt, is the mission to
   our sacred buildings of the police and their commissary, with the
   intention of taking either voluntary or forcible possession of them:
   he had attacked many others, and came hither with like intent,
   demanding the surrender of the temple according to the Imperial decree,
   but was so far from succeeding in any of his wishes that, had he not
   speedily given way before my father, either from his own good sense or
   according to some advice given to him, he would have had to retire with
   his feet mangled, with such wrath and zeal did the priest boil against
   him in defence of his shrine.  And who had a manifestly greater share
   in bringing about his end, both in public, by the prayers and united
   supplications which he directed against the accursed one, without
   regard to the [dangers of] the time; and in private, arraying against
   him his nightly armoury, of sleeping on the ground, by which he wore
   away his aged and tender frame, and of tears, with whose fountains he
   watered the ground for almost a whole year, directing these practices
   to the Searcher of hearts alone, while he tried to escape our notice,
   in his retiring piety of which I have spoken.  And he would have been
   utterly unobserved, had I not once suddenly rushed into his room, and
   noticing the tokens of his lying upon the ground, inquired of his
   attendants what they meant, and so learned the mystery of the night.

   33.  A further story of the same period and the same courage.  The city
   of Cæsarea was in an uproar about the election of a bishop; for one
   [3258] had just departed, and another must be found, amidst heated
   partisanship not easily to be soothed.  For the city was naturally
   exposed to party spirit, owing to the fervour of its faith, and the
   rivalry was increased by the illustrious position of the see.  Such was
   the state of affairs; several Bishops had arrived to consecrate the
   Bishop; the populace was divided into several parties, each with its
   own candidate, as is usual in such cases, owing to the influences of
   private friendship or devotion to God; but at last the whole people
   came to an agreement, and, with the aid of a band of soldiers at that
   time quartered there, seized one of [3259] their leading citizens, a
   man of excellent life, but not yet sealed with the divine baptism,
   brought him against his will to the sanctuary, and setting him before
   the Bishops, begged, with entreaties mingled with violence, that he
   might be consecrated and proclaimed, not in the best of order, but with
   all sincerity and ardour.  Nor is it possible to say whom time pointed
   out as more illustrious and religious than he was.  What then took
   place, as the result of the uproar?  Their [3260] resistance was
   overcome, they purified him, they proclaimed him, they enthroned him,
   by external action, rather than by spiritual judgment and disposition,
   as the sequel shows.  They were glad to retire and regain freedom of
   judgment, and agreed upon a plan--I do not know that it was inspired by
   the Spirit--to hold nothing which had been done to be valid, and the
   institution to have been void, pleading violence on the part of him who
   had had no less violence done to himself, and laying hold of certain
   words which had been uttered on the occasion with greater vigour than
   wisdom.  But the great high-priest and just examiner of actions was not
   carried away by this plan of theirs, and did not approve of their
   judgment, but remained as uninfluenced and unmoved as if no pressure at
   all had been put upon him.  For he saw that, the violence having been
   common, if they brought any charge against him, they were themselves
   liable to a counter-charge, or, if they acquitted him, they themselves
   might be acquitted, or rather with still more justice, they were unable
   to secure their own acquittal, even by acquitting him:  for if they
   were deserving of excuse, so assuredly was he, and if he was not, much
   less were they:  for it would have been far better to have at the time
   run the risk of resistance to the last extremity, than afterwards to
   enter into designs against him, especially at such a juncture, when it
   was better to put an end to existing enmities than to devise new ones.
   For the state of affairs was as follows.

   34.  The Emperor [3261] had come, raging against the Christians; he was
   angry at the election and threatened the elect, and the city stood in
   imminent peril [3262] as to whether, after that day it should cease to
   exist, or escape and be treated with some degree of mercy.  The
   innovation in regard to the election was a new ground of exasperation,
   in addition to the destruction of the temple of Fortune in a time of
   prosperity, and was looked upon as an invasion of his rights.  The
   governor of the province also was eager to turn the opportunity to his
   own account, and was ill disposed to the new bishop, with whom he had
   never had friendly relations, in consequence of their different
   political views.  Accordingly he sent letters to summon the
   consecrators to invalidate the election, and in no gentle terms, for
   they were threatened as if by command of the Emperor.  Hereupon, when
   the letter reached him, without fear or delay, he replied--consider the
   courage and spirit of his answer--"Most excellent governor, we have one
   Censor of all our actions, and one Emperor, against whom his enemies
   are in arms.  He will review the present consecration, which we have
   legitimately performed according to His will.  In regard to any other
   matter, you may, if you will, use violence with the greatest ease
   against us.  But no one can prevent us from vindicating the legitimacy
   and justice of our action in this case; unless you should make a law on
   this point, you, who have no right to interfere in our affairs."  This
   letter excited the admiration of its recipient, although he was for a
   while annoyed at it, as we have been told by many who know the facts
   well.  It also stayed the action of the Emperor, and delivered the city
   from peril, and ourselves, it is not amiss to add, from disgrace.  This
   was the work of the occupant of an unimportant and suffragan see.  Is
   not a presidency of this kind far preferable to a title derived from a
   superior see, and a power which is based upon action rather than upon a
   name.

   35.  Who is so distant from this world of ours, as to be ignorant of
   what is last in order, but the first and greatest proof of his power?
   The same city was again in an uproar for the same reason, in
   consequence of the sudden removal of the Bishop chosen with such
   honourable violence, who had now departed to God, on Whose behalf he
   had nobly and bravely contended in the persecutions.  The heat of the
   disturbance was in proportion to its unreasonableness.  The man of
   eminence was not unknown, but was more conspicuous than the sun amidst
   the stars, in the eyes not only of all others, but especially of that
   select and most pure portion of the people, whose business is in the
   sanctuary, and the Nazarites [3263] amongst us, to whom such
   appointments should, if not entirely, as much as possible belong, and
   so the church would be free from harm, instead of to the most opulent
   and powerful, or the violent and unreasonable portion of the people,
   and especially the most corrupt of them.  Indeed, I am almost inclined
   to believe that the civil government is more orderly than ours, to
   which divine grace is attributed, and that such matters are better
   regulated by fear than by reason.  For what man in his senses could
   ever have approached another, to the neglect of your divine [3264] and
   sacred person, who have been beautified by the hands of the Lord, the
   unwedded, the destitute of property and almost of flesh and blood, who
   in your words come next to the Word Himself, who are wise among
   philosophers, superior to the world among worldlings, my companion and
   workfellow, and to speak more daringly, the sharer with me of a common
   soul, the partaker of my life and education.  Would that I could speak
   at liberty and describe you before others without being obliged by your
   presence, in dwelling upon such topics, to pass over the greater part
   of them, lest I should incur the suspicion of flattery.  But, as I
   began by saying, the Spirit must needs have known him as His own; yet
   he was the mark of envy, at the hands of those whom I am ashamed to
   mention, and would that it were not possible to hear their names from
   others who studiously ridicule our affairs.  Let us pass this by like a
   rock in the midstream of a river, and treat with respectful silence a
   subject which ought to be forgotten, as we pass on to the remainder of
   our subject.

   36.  The things of the Spirit were exactly known to the man of the
   Spirit, and he felt that he must take up no submissive position, nor
   side with factions and prejudices which depend upon favour rather than
   upon God, but must make the advantage of the Church and the common
   salvation his sole object.  Accordingly he wrote, gave advice, strove
   to unite the people and the clergy, whether ministering in the
   sanctuary or not, gave his testimony, his decision and his vote, even
   in his absence, and assumed, in virtue of his gray hairs, the exercise
   of authority among strangers no less than among his own flock.  At
   last, since it was necessary that the consecration should be canonical,
   and there was [3265] lacking one of the proper number of Bishops for
   the proclamation, he tore himself from his couch, exhausted as he was
   by age and disease, and manfully went to the city, or rather was borne,
   with his body dead though just breathing, persuaded that, if anything
   were to happen to him, this devotion would be a noble winding-sheet.
   Hereupon once more there was a prodigy, not unworthy of credit.  He
   received strength from his toil, new life from his zeal, presided at
   the function, took his place in the conflict, enthroned the Bishop, and
   was conducted home, no longer borne upon a bier, but in a divine ark.
   His long-suffering, over whose praises I have already lingered, was in
   this case further exhibited.  For his colleagues were annoyed at the
   shame of being overcome, and at the public influence of the old man,
   and allowed their annoyance to show itself in abuse of him; but such
   was the strength of his endurance that he was superior even to this,
   finding in modesty a most powerful ally, and refusing to bandy abuse
   with them.  For he felt that it would be a terrible thing, after really
   gaining the victory, to be vanquished by the tongue.  In consequence,
   he so won upon them by his long-suffering, that, when time had lent its
   aid to his judgment, they exchanged their annoyance for admiration, and
   knelt before him to ask his pardon, in shame for their previous
   conduct, and flinging away their hatred, submitted to him as their
   patriarch, lawgiver, and judge.

   37.  From the same zeal proceeded his opposition to the heretics, when,
   with the aid of the Emperor's impiety, they made their expedition, in
   the hope of overpowering us also, and adding us to the number of the
   others whom they had, in almost all cases, succeeded in enslaving.  For
   in this he afforded us no slight assistance, both in himself, and by
   hounding us on like well-bred dogs against these most savage beasts,
   through his training in piety.  On one point I blame you both, and pray
   do not take amiss my plainspeaking, if I should annoy you by expressing
   the cause of my pain.  When I was disgusted at the evils of life, and
   longing, if anyone of our day has longed, for solitude, and eager, as
   speedily as possible, to escape to some haven of safety, from the surge
   and dust of public life, it was you who, somehow or other seized and
   gave me up by the noble title of the priesthood to this base and
   treacherous mart of souls.  In consequence, evils have already befallen
   me, and others are yet to be anticipated.  For past experience renders
   a man somewhat distrustful of the future, in spite of the better
   suggestions of reason to the contrary.

   38.  Another of his excellences I must not leave unnoticed.  In
   general, he was a man of great endurance, and superior to his robe of
   flesh:  but during the pain of his last sickness, a serious addition to
   the risks and burdens of old age, his weakness was common to him and
   all other men; but this fitting sequel to the other marvels, so far
   from being common, was peculiarly his own.  He was at no time free from
   the anguish of pain, but often in the day, sometimes in the hour, his
   only relief was the liturgy, to which the pain yielded, as if to an
   edict of banishment.  At last, after a life of almost a hundred years,
   exceeding David's limit of our age, [3266] forty-five of these, the
   average life of man, having been spent in the priesthood, he brought it
   to a close in a good old age.  And in what manner?  With the words and
   forms of prayer, leaving behind no trace of vice, and many
   recollections of virtue.  The reverence felt for him was thus greater
   than falls to the lot of man, both on the lips and in the hearts of
   all.  Nor is it easy to find anyone who recollects him, and does not,
   as the Scripture says, lay his hand upon his mouth [3267] and salute
   his memory.  Such was his life, and such its completion and perfection.

   39.  And since some living memorial of his munificence ought to be left
   behind, what other is required than this temple, which he reared for
   God and for us, with very little contribution from the people in
   addition to the expenditure of his private fortune?  An exploit which
   should not be buried in silence, since in size it is superior to most
   others, in beauty absolutely to all.  It surrounds itself with eight
   regular equilaterals, and is raised aloft by the beauty of two stories
   of pillars and porticos, while the statues placed upon them are true to
   the life; its vault flashes down upon us from above, and it dazzles our
   eyes with abundant sources of light on every side, being indeed the
   dwelling-place of light.  It is surrounded by excrescent equiangular
   ambulatories of most splendid material, with a wide area in the midst,
   while its doors and vestibules shed around it the lustre of their
   gracefulness, and offer from a distance their welcome to those who are
   drawing nigh.  I have not yet mentioned the external ornament, the
   beauty and size of the squared and dove-tailed stonework, whether it be
   of marble in the bases and capitals, which divide the angles, or from
   our own quarries, which are in no wise inferior to those abroad; nor of
   the belts of many shapes and colours, projecting or inlaid from the
   foundation to the roof-tree, which robs the spectator by limiting his
   view.  How could anyone with due brevity describe a work which cost so
   much time and toil and skill:  or will it suffice to say that amid all
   the works, private and public, which adorn other cities, this has of
   itself been able to secure us celebrity among the majority of mankind?
   When for such a temple a priest was needed, he also at his own expense
   provided one, whether worthy of the temple or no, it is not for me to
   say.  And when sacrifices were required, he supplied them also, in the
   misfortunes of his son, and his patience under trials, that God might
   receive at his hands a reasonable whole burnt offering and spiritual
   priesthood, to be honourably consumed, instead of the sacrifice of the
   Law.

   40.  What sayest thou, my father?  Is this sufficient, and dost thou
   find an ample recompense for all thy toils, which thou didst undergo
   for my learning, in this eulogy of farewell or of entombment?  And dost
   thou, as of old, impose silence on my tongue, and bid me stop in due
   time, and so avoid excess?  Or dost thou require some addition?  I know
   thou bidst me cease, for I have said enough.  Yet suffer me to add
   this.  Make known to us where thou art in glory, and the light which
   encircles thee, and receive into the same abode thy partner soon to
   follow thee, and the children whom thou hadst laid to rest before thee,
   and me also, after no further, or but a slight addition to the ills of
   this life:  and before reaching that abode receive me in this sweet
   stone, [3268] which thou didst erect for both of us, to the honour even
   here of thy consecrated namesake, and excuse me from the care both of
   the people which I have already resigned, [3269] and of that which for
   thy sake I have since accepted:  and mayest thou guide and free from
   peril, as I earnestly entreat, the whole flock and all the clergy,
   whose father thou art said to be, but especially him who was
   overpowered by thy paternal and spiritual coercion, so that he may not
   entirely consider that act of tyranny obnoxious to blame.

   41.  And what do you think of us, O judge of my words and motions?  If
   we have spoken adequately, and to the satisfaction of your desire,
   confirm it by your decision, and we accept it:  for your decision is
   entirely the decision of God.  But if it falls far short of his glory
   and of your hope, my ally is not far to seek.  Let fall thy voice,
   which is awaited by his merits like a seasonable shower.  And indeed he
   has upon you the highest claims, those of a pastor upon a pastor and of
   a father upon his son in grace.  What wonder if he, who has [3270]
   through your voice thundered throughout the world, should himself have
   some enjoyment of it?  What more is needed?  Only to unite with our
   spiritual Sarah, the consort and fellow-traveller through life of our
   great father Abraham, in the last Christian offices.

   42.  The nature of God, my mother, is not the same as that of men;
   indeed, to speak generally, the nature of divine things is not the same
   as that of earthly things.  They possess unchangeableness and
   immortality, and absolute being with its consequences, for sure are the
   properties of things sure.  But how is it with what is ours?  It is in
   a state of flux and corruption, constantly undergoing some fresh
   change.  Life and death, as they are called, apparently so different,
   are in a sense resolved into, and successive to, each other.  For the
   one takes its rise from the corruption which is our mother, runs its
   course through the corruption which is the displacement of all that is
   present, and comes to an end in the corruption which is the dissolution
   of this life; while the other, which is able to set us free from the
   ills of this life, and oftentimes translates us to the life above, is
   not in my opinion accurately called death, and is more dreadful in name
   than in reality; so that we are in danger of irrationally being afraid
   of what is not fearful, and courting as preferable what we really ought
   to fear.  There is one life, to look to life.  There is one death, sin,
   for it is the destruction of the soul.  But all else, of which some are
   proud, is a dream-vision, making sport of realities, and a series of
   phantasms which lead the soul astray.  If this be our condition,
   mother, we shall neither be proud of life, nor greatly hurt, by death.
   What grievance can we find in being transferred hence to the true
   life?  In being freed from the vicissitudes, the agitation, the
   disgust, and all the vile tribute we must pay to this life, to find
   ourselves, amid stable things, which know no flux, while as lesser
   lights, we circle round the great light? [3271]

   43.  Does the sense of separation cause you pain?  Let hope cheer you.
   Is widowhood grievous to you?  Yet it is not so to him.  And what is
   the good of love, if it gives itself easy things, and assigns the more
   difficult to its neighbour?  And why should it be grievous at all, to
   one who is soon to pass away?  The appointed day is at hand, the pain
   will not last long.  Let us not, by ignoble reasonings, make a burden
   of things which are really light.  We have endured a great
   loss--because the privilege we enjoyed was great.  Loss is common to
   all, such a privilege to few.  Let us rise superior to the one thought
   by the consolation of the other.  For it is more reasonable, that that
   which is better should win the day.  You have borne, in a most brave,
   Christian spirit, the loss of children, who were still in their prime
   and qualified for life; bear also the laying aside of his aged body by
   one who was weary of life, although his vigor of mind preserved for him
   his senses unimpaired.  Do you want some one to care for you?  Where is
   your Isaac, whom he left behind for you, to take his place in all
   respects?  Ask of him small things, the support of his hand and
   service, and requite him with greater things, a mother's blessing and
   prayers, and the consequent freedom.  Are you vexed at being
   admonished?  I praise you for it.  For you have admonished many whom
   your long life has brought under your notice.  What I have said can
   have no application to you, who are so truly wise; but let it be a
   general medicine of consolation for mourners, so that they may know
   that they are mortals following mortals to the grave.

   Oration XXI.

   On the Great Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria.

   The reference in §22 to "the Council which sat first at Seleucia...and
   afterwards at this mighty city," leaves no room for doubting that the
   Oration was delivered at Constantinople.  Further local colour is found
   in the allusions of §5.  We are assured by the panegyric on S. Cyprian
   (Orat. xxiv. 1) that it was already the custom of the Church of
   Constantinople to observe annual festivals in honour of the Saints:
   and at present two days are kept by the Eastern Church, viz., Jan.
   18th, as the day of the actual death of S. Athanasius, and May 2d, in
   memory of the translation of his remains to the church of S. Sophia at
   Constantinople.  Probably, therefore, this Oration was delivered on the
   former day, on which Assemani holds that S. Athanasius died.  Papebroke
   and (with some hesitation) Dr. Bright pronounce in favour of May 2d.
   Tillemont supposes that a.d. 379 is the year of its delivery; in which
   case it must have been very shortly after S. Gregory's arrival in the
   city.  Since, however, no allusion is made to this, it seems, on the
   whole, more likely that it should be assigned to a.d. 380.  The sermon
   takes high rank, even among S. Gregory's discourses, as the model of an
   ecclesiastical panegyric.  It lacks, however, the charm of personal
   affection and intimate acquaintance with the inner life, which is
   characteristic of the orations concerned with his own relatives and
   friends.

   1.  In praising Athanasius, I shall be praising virtue.  To speak of
   him and to praise virtue are identical, because he had, or, to speak
   more truly, has embraced virtue in its entirety.  For all who have
   lived according to God still live unto God, though they have departed
   hence.  For this reason, God is called the God of Abraham, Isaac and
   Jacob, since He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living. [3272]
     Again, in praising virtue, I shall be praising God, who gives virtue
   to men and lifts them up, or lifts them up again, to Himself by the
   enlightenment which is akin to Himself. [3273]   For many and great as
   are our blessings--none can say how many and how great--which we have
   and shall have from God, this is the greatest and kindliest of all, our
   inclination and relationship to Him.  For God is to intelligible things
   what the sun is to the things of sense.  The one lightens the visible,
   the other the invisible, world.  The one makes our bodily eyes to see
   the sun, the other makes our intellectual natures to see God.  And, as
   that, which bestows on the things which see and are seen the power of
   seeing and being seen, is itself the most beautiful of visible things;
   so God, who creates, for those who think, and that which is thought of,
   the power of thinking and being thought of, is Himself the highest of
   the objects of thought, in Whom every desire finds its bourne, beyond
   Whom it can no further go.  For not even the most philosophic, the most
   piercing, the most curious intellect has, or can ever have, a more
   exalted object.  For this is the utmost of things desirable, and they
   who arrive at it find an entire rest from speculation.

   2.  Whoever has been permitted to escape by reason and contemplation
   from matter and this fleshly cloud or veil (whichever it should be
   called) and to hold communion with God, and be associated, as far as
   man's nature can attain, with the purest Light, blessed is he, both
   from his ascent from hence, and for his deification there, which is
   conferred by true philosophy, and by rising superior to the dualism of
   matter, through the unity which is perceived in the Trinity.  And
   whosoever has been depraved by being knit to the flesh, and so far
   oppressed by the clay that he cannot look at the rays of truth, nor
   rise above things below, though he is born from above, and called to
   things above, I hold him to be miserable in his blindness, even though
   he may abound in things of this world; and all the more, because he is
   the sport of his abundance, and is persuaded by it that something else
   is beautiful instead of that which is really beautiful, reaping, as the
   poor fruit of his poor opinion, the sentence of darkness, or the seeing
   Him to be fire, Whom he did not recognize as light.

   3.  Such has been the philosophy of few, both nowadays and of old--for
   few are the men of God, though all are His handiwork,--among lawgivers,
   generals, priests, Prophets, Evangelists, Apostles, shepherds,
   teachers, and all the spiritual host and band--and, among them all, of
   him whom now we praise.  And whom do I mean by these?  Men like Enoch,
   Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the twelve Patriarchs, Moses, Aaron,
   Joshua, the Judges, Samuel, David, to some extent Solomon, Elijah,
   Elisha, the Prophets before the captivity, those after the captivity,
   and, though last in order, first in truth, those who were concerned
   with Christ's Incarnation or taking of our nature, the lamp [3274]
   before the Light, the voice before the Word, the mediator before the
   Mediator, the mediator between the old covenant and the new, the famous
   John, the disciples of Christ, those after Christ, who were set over
   the people, or illustrious in word, or conspicuous for miracles, or
   made perfect through their blood.

   4.  With some of these Athanasius vied, by some he was slightly
   excelled, and others, if it is not bold to say so, he surpassed:  some
   he made his models in mental power, others in activity, others in
   meekness, others in zeal, others in dangers, others in most respects,
   others in all, gathering from one and another various forms of beauty
   (like men who paint figures of ideal excellence), and combining them in
   his single soul, he made one perfect form of virtue out of all,
   excelling in action men of intellectual capacity, in intellect men of
   action; or, if you will, surpassing in intellect men renowned for
   intellect, in action those of the greatest active power; outstripping
   those who had moderate reputation in both respects, by his eminence in
   either, and those who stood highest in one or other, by his powers in
   both; and, if it is a great thing for those who have received an
   example, so to use it as to attach themselves to virtue, he has no
   inferior title to fame, who for our advantage has set an example to
   those who come after him.

   5.  To speak of and admire him fully, would perhaps be too long a task
   for the present purpose of my discourse, and would take the form of a
   history rather than of a panegyric:  a history which it has been the
   object of my desires to commit to writing for the pleasure and
   instruction of posterity, as he himself wrote the life of the divine
   Antony, [3275] and set forth, in the form of a narrative, the laws of
   the monastic life.  Accordingly, after entering into a few of the many
   details of his history, such as memory suggests at the moment as most
   noteworthy, in order both to satisfy my own longing and fulfil the duty
   which befits the festival, we will leave the many others to those who
   know them.  For indeed, it is neither pious nor safe, while the lives
   of the ungodly are honoured by recollection, to pass by in silence
   those who have lived piously, especially in a city which could hardly
   be saved by many examples of virtue, making sport, as it does, of
   Divine things, no less than of the horse-race and the theatre.

   6.  He was brought up, from the first, in religious habits and
   practices, after a brief study of literature and philosophy, so that he
   might not be utterly unskilled in such subjects, or ignorant of matters
   which he had determined to despise.  For his generous and eager soul
   could not brook being occupied in vanities, like unskilled athletes,
   who beat the air instead of their antagonists and lose the prize.  From
   meditating on every book of the Old and New Testament, with a depth
   such as none else has applied even to one of them, he grew rich in
   contemplation, rich in splendour of life, combining them in wondrous
   sort by that golden bond which few can weave; using life as the guide
   of contemplation, contemplation as the seal of life.  For the fear of
   the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and, so to say, its first swathing
   band; but, when wisdom has burst the bonds of fear and risen up to
   love, it makes us friends of God, and sons instead of bondsmen.

   7.  Thus brought up and trained, as even now those should be who are to
   preside over the people, and take the direction of the mighty body of
   Christ, [3276] according to the will and foreknowledge of God, which
   lays long before the foundations of great deeds, he was invested with
   this important ministry, and made one of those who draw near to the God
   Who draws near to us, and deemed worthy of the holy office and rank,
   and, after passing through the entire series of orders, he was (to make
   my story short) entrusted with the chief rule over the people, in other
   words, the charge of the whole world:  nor can I say whether he
   received the priesthood as the reward of virtue, or to be the fountain
   and life of the Church.  For she, like Ishmael, [3277] fainting from
   her thirst for the truth, needed to be given to drink, or, like Elijah,
   [3278] to be refreshed from the brook, when the land was parched by
   drought; and, when but faintly breathing, to be restored to life and
   left as a seed to Israel, [3279] that we might not become like Sodom
   and Gomorrah, [3280] whose destruction by the rain of fire and
   brimstone is only more notorious than their wickedness.  Therefore,
   when we were cast down, a horn of salvation was raised up for us,
   [3281] and a chief corner stone, [3282] knitting us to itself and to
   one another, was laid in due season, or a fire [3283] to purify our
   base and evil matter, [3284] or a farmer's fan [3285] to winnow the
   light from the weighty in doctrine, or a sword to cut out the roots of
   wickedness; and so the Word finds him as his own ally, and the Spirit
   takes possession of one who will breathe on His behalf.

   8.  Thus, and for these reasons, by the vote of the whole people, not
   in the evil fashion which has since prevailed, nor by means of
   bloodshed and oppression, but in an apostolic and spiritual manner, he
   is led up to the throne [3286] of Saint Mark, to succeed him in piety,
   no less than in office; in the latter indeed at a great distance from
   him, in the former, which is the genuine right of succession, following
   him closely.  For unity in doctrine deserves unity in office; and a
   rival teacher sets up a rival throne; the one is a successor in
   reality, the other but in name.  For it is not the intruder, but he
   whose rights are intruded upon, who is the successor, not the
   lawbreaker, but the lawfully appointed, not the man of contrary
   opinions, but the man of the same faith; if this is not what we mean by
   successor, he succeeds in the same sense as disease to health, darkness
   to light, storm to calm, and frenzy to sound sense.

   9.  The duties of his office he discharged in the same spirit as that
   in which he had been preferred to it.  For he did not at once, after
   taking possession of his throne, like men who have unexpectedly seized
   upon some sovereignty or inheritance, grow insolent from intoxication.
   This is the conduct of illegitimate and intrusive priests, who are
   unworthy of their vocation; whose preparation for the priesthood has
   cost them nothing, who have endured no inconvenience for the sake of
   virtue, who only begin to study religion when appointed to teach it,
   and undertake the cleansing of others before being cleansed themselves;
   yesterday sacrilegious, to-day sacerdotal; yesterday excluded from the
   sanctuary, [3287] to-day its officiants; proficient in vice, novices in
   piety; the product of the favour of man, not of the grace of the
   Spirit; who, having run through the whole gamut of violence, at last
   tyrannize over even piety; who, instead of gaining credit for their
   office by their character, need for their character the credit of their
   office, thus subverting the due relation between them; who ought to
   offer more sacrifices [3288] for themselves than for the ignorances of
   the people; [3289] who inevitably fall into one of two errors, either,
   from their own need of indulgence, being excessively indulgent, and so
   even teaching, instead of checking, vice, or cloaking their own sins
   under the harshness of their rule.  Both these extremes he avoided; he
   was sublime in action, lowly in mind; inaccessible in virtue, most
   accessible in intercourse; gentle, free from anger, sympathetic, sweet
   in words, sweeter in disposition; angelic in appearance, more angelic
   in mind; calm in rebuke, persuasive in praise, without spoiling the
   good effect of either by excess, but rebuking with the tenderness of a
   father, praising with the dignity of a ruler, his tenderness was not
   dissipated, nor his severity sour; for the one was reasonable, the
   other prudent, and both truly wise; his disposition sufficed for the
   training of his spiritual children, with very little need of words; his
   words with very little need of the rod, [3290] and his moderate use of
   the rod with still less for the knife.

   10.  But why should I paint for you the portrait of the man?  St. Paul
   [3291] has sketched him by anticipation.  This he does, when he sings
   the praises of the great High-priest, who hath passed through the
   heavens [3292] (for I will venture to say even this, since Scripture
   [3293] can call those who live according to Christ by the name of
   Christs): [3294]   and again when by the rules in his letter to
   Timothy, [3295] he gives a model for future Bishops:  for if you will
   apply the law as a test to him who deserves these praises, you will
   clearly perceive his perfect exactness.  Come then to aid me in my
   panegyric; for I am labouring heavily in my speech, and though I desire
   to pass by point after point, they seize upon me one after another, and
   I can find no surpassing excellence in a form which is in all respects
   well proportioned and beautiful; for each as it occurs to me seems
   fairer than the rest and so takes by storm my speech.  Come then I
   pray, you who have been his admirers and witnesses, divide among
   yourselves his excellences, contend bravely with one another, men and
   women alike, young men and maidens, old men and children, priests and
   people, solitaries and cenobites, [3296] men of simple or of exact
   life, contemplatives or practically minded.  Let one praise him in his
   fastings and prayers as if he had been disembodied and immaterial,
   another his unweariedness and zeal for vigils and psalmody, another his
   patronage of the needy, another his dauntlessness towards the powerful,
   or his condescension to the lowly.  Let the virgins celebrate the
   friend of the Bridegroom; [3297] those under the yoke [3298] their
   restrainer, hermits him who lent wings to their course, cenobites their
   lawgiver, simple folk their guide, contemplatives the divine, the
   joyous their bridle, the unfortunate their consolation, the
   hoary-headed their staff, youths their instructor, the poor their
   resource, the wealthy their steward.  Even the widows will, methinks,
   praise their protector, even the orphans their father, even the poor
   their benefactor, strangers their entertainer, brethren the man of
   brotherly love, the sick their physician, in whatever sickness or
   treatment you will, the healthy the guard of health, yea all men him
   who made himself all things to all men that he might gain almost, if
   not quite, all.

   11.  On these grounds, as I have said, I leave others, who have leisure
   to admire the minor details of his character, to admire and extol him.
   I call them minor details only in comparing him and his character with
   his own standard, for that which hath been made glorious hath not been
   made glorious, even though it be exceeding splendid by reason of the
   glory that surpasseth, [3299] as we are told; for indeed the minor
   points of his excellence would suffice to win celebrity for others.
   But since it would be intolerable for me to leave the word and serve
   [3300] less important details, I must turn to that which is his chief
   characteristic; and God alone, on Whose behalf I am speaking, can
   enable me to say anything worthy of a soul so noble and so mighty in
   the word.

   12.  In the palmy days of the Church, when all was well, the present
   elaborate, far-fetched and artificial treatment of Theology had not
   made its way into the schools of divinity, but playing with pebbles
   which deceive the eye by the quickness of their changes, or dancing
   before an audience with varied and effeminate contortions, were looked
   upon as all one with speaking or hearing of God in a way unusual or
   frivolous.  But since the Sextuses [3301] and Pyrrhos, and the
   antithetic style, like a dire and malignant disease, have infected our
   churches, and babbling is reputed culture, and, as the book of the Acts
   [3302] says of the Athenians, we spend our time in nothing else but
   either to tell or to hear some new thing.  O what Jeremiah [3303] will
   bewail our confusion and blind madness; he alone could utter
   lamentations befitting our misfortunes.

   13.  The beginning of this madness was Arius (whose name is derived
   from frenzy [3304] ), who paid the penalty of his unbridled tongue by
   his death in a profane spot, [3305] brought about by prayer not by
   disease, when he like Judas [3306] burst asunder [3307] for his similar
   treachery to the Word.  Then others, catching the infection, organized
   an art of impiety, and, confining Deity to the Unbegotten, expelled
   from Deity not only the Begotten, but also the Proceeding one, and
   honoured the Trinity with communion in name [3308] alone, or even
   refused to retain this for it.  Not so that blessed one, Who was indeed
   a man of God and a mighty trumpet of truth:  but being aware that to
   contract [3309] the Three Persons to a numerical Unity is heretical,
   and the innovation of Sabellius, who first devised a contraction of
   Deity; and that to sever the Three Persons by a distinction of nature,
   is an unnatural mutilation of Deity; he both happily preserved the
   Unity, which belongs to the Godhead, and religiously taught the
   Trinity, which refers [3310] to Personality, neither confounding the
   Three Persons in the Unity, nor dividing the Substance among the Three
   Persons, but abiding within the bounds of piety, by avoiding excessive
   inclination or opposition to either side.

   14.  And therefore, first in the holy Synod of Nicæa, [3311] the
   gathering of the three hundred and eighteen chosen men, united by the
   Holy Ghost, as far as in him lay, he stayed the disease.  Though not
   yet ranked among the Bishops, he held the first rank among the members
   of the Council, for preference was given to virtue just as much as to
   office.  Afterwards, when the flame had been fanned by the blasts of
   the evil one, and had spread very widely (hence came the tragedies of
   which almost the whole earth and sea are full), the fight raged
   fiercely around him who was the noble champion of the Word.  For the
   assault is hottest upon the point of resistance, while various dangers
   surround it on every side:  for impiety is skilful in designing evils,
   and excessively daring in taking them in hand:  and how would they
   spare men, who had not spared the Godhead?  Yet one of the assaults was
   the most dangerous of all:  and I myself contribute somewhat to this
   scene; yea, let me plead for the innocence of my dear fatherland, for
   the wickedness was not due to the land that bore them, but to the men
   who undertook it.  For holy indeed is that land, and everywhere noted
   for its piety, but these men are unworthy of the Church which bore
   them, and ye have heard of a briar growing in a vine; [3312] and the
   traitor [3313] was Judas, one of the disciples.

   15.  There are some who do not excuse even my namesake [3314] from
   blame; who, living at Alexandria at the time for the sake of culture,
   although he had been most kindly treated by him, as if the dearest of
   his children, and received his special confidence, yet joined in the
   revolutionary plot against his father and patron:  for, though others
   took the active part in it, the hand of Absalom [3315] was with them,
   as the saying goes.  If any of you had heard of the hand which was
   produced by fraud against the Saint, and the corpse [3316] of the
   living man, and the unjust banishment, he knows what I mean.  But this
   I will gladly forget.  For on doubtful points, I am disposed to think
   we ought to incline to the charitable side, and acquit rather than
   condemn the accused.  For a bad man would speedily condemn even a good
   man, while a good man would not be ready to condemn even a bad one.
   For one who is not ready to do ill, is not inclined even to suspect
   it.  I come now to what is matter of fact, not of report, what is
   vouched for as truth instead of unverified suspicion.

   16.  There was a monster [3317] from Cappadocia, born on our farthest
   confines, of low birth, and lower mind, whose blood was not perfectly
   free, but mongrel, as we know that of mules to be; at first, dependent
   on the table of others, whose price was a barley cake, who had learnt
   to say and do everything with an eye to his stomach, and, at last,
   after sneaking into public life, and filling its lowest offices, such
   as that of contractor for swine's flesh, the soldiers' rations, and
   then having proved himself a scoundrel for the sake of greed in this
   public trust, and been stripped to the skin, contrived to escape, and
   after passing, as exiles do, from country to country and city to city,
   last of all, in an evil hour for the Christian community, like one of
   the plagues of Egypt, he reached Alexandria.  There, his wanderings
   being stayed, he began his villany.  Good for nothing in all other
   respects, without culture, without fluency in conversation, without
   even the form and pretence of reverence, his skill in working villany
   and confusion was unequalled.

   17.  His acts of insolence towards the saint you all know in full
   detail.  Often were the righteous given into the hands of the wicked,
   [3318] not that the latter might be honoured, but that the former might
   be tested:  and though the wicked come, as it is written, to an awful
   death, [3319] nevertheless for the present the godly are a laughing
   stock, while the goodness of God and the great treasuries of what is in
   store for each of them hereafter are concealed.  Then indeed word and
   deed and thought will be weighed in the just balances of God, as He
   arises to judge the earth, [3320] gathering together counsel and works,
   and revealing what He had kept sealed up. [3321]   Of this let the
   words and sufferings of Job convince thee, who was a truthful,
   blameless, just, godfearing man, with all those other qualities which
   are testified of him, and yet was smitten with such a succession of
   remarkable visitations, at the hands of him who begged for power over
   him, that, although many have often suffered in the whole course of
   time, and some even have, as is probable, been grievously afflicted,
   yet none can be compared with him in misfortunes.  For he not only
   suffered, without being allowed space to mourn for his losses in their
   rapid succession, the loss of his money, his possessions, his large and
   fair family, blessings for which all men care; but was at last smitten
   with an incurable disease horrible to look upon, and, to crown his
   misfortunes, had a wife whose only comfort was evil counsel.  For his
   surpassing troubles were those of his soul added to those of the body.
   [3322]   He had also among his friends truly miserable comforters,
   [3323] as he calls them, who could not help him.  For when they saw his
   suffering, in ignorance of its hidden meaning, they supposed his
   disaster to be the punishment of vice and not the touchstone of
   virtue.  And they not only thought this, but were not even ashamed to
   reproach him with his lot, [3324] at a time when, even if he had been
   suffering for vice, they ought to have treated his grief with words of
   consolation.

   18.  Such was the lot of Job:  such at first sight his history.  In
   reality it was a contest between virtue and envy: [3325]   the one
   straining every nerve to overcome the good, the other enduring
   everything, that it might abide unsubdued; the one striving to smooth
   the way for vice, by means of the chastisement of the upright, the
   other to retain its hold upon the good, even if they do exceed others
   in misfortunes.  What then of Him who answered Job out of the whirlwind
   and cloud, [3326] Who is slow to chastise and swift to help, Who
   suffers not utterly the rod of the wicked to come into the lot of the
   righteous, lest the righteous should learn iniquity? [3327]   At the
   end of the contests He declares the victory of the athlete in a
   splendid proclamation and lays bare the secret of his calamities,
   saying:  "Thinkest thou that I have dealt with thee for any other
   purpose than the manifestation of thy righteousness?" [3328]   This is
   the balm for his wounds, this is the crown of the contest, this the
   reward for his patience.  For perhaps his subsequent prosperity was
   small, great as it may seem to some, and ordained for the sake of small
   minds, even though he received again twice as much as he had lost.

   19.  In this case then it is not wonderful, if George had the advantage
   of Athanasius; nay it would be more wonderful, if the righteous were
   not tried in the fire of contumely; nor is this very wonderful, as it
   would have been had the flames availed for more than this.  Then he was
   in retirement, and arranged his exile most excellently, for he betook
   himself to the holy and divine homes [3329] of contemplation in Egypt,
   where, secluding themselves from the world, and welcoming the desert,
   men live to God more than all who exist in the body.  Some struggle on
   in an utterly monastic and solitary life, speaking to themselves alone
   and to God, [3330] and all the world they know is what meets their eyes
   in the desert.  Others, cherishing the law of love in community, are at
   once Solitaries and Coenobites, dead to all other men and to the eddies
   of public affairs which whirl us and are whirled about themselves and
   make sport of us in their sudden changes, being the world to one
   another and whetting the edge of their love in emulation.  During his
   intercourse with them, the great Athanasius, who was always the
   mediator and reconciler of all other men, like Him Who made peace
   through His blood [3331] between things which were at variance,
   reconciled the solitary with the community life:  by showing that the
   Priesthood is capable of contemplation, and that contemplation is in
   need of a spiritual guide.

   20.  Thus he combined the two, and so united the partisans of both calm
   action and of active calm, as to convince them that the monastic life
   is characterised by steadfastness of disposition rather than by bodily
   retirement.  Accordingly the great David was a man of at once the most
   active and most solitary life, if any one thinks the verse, I am in
   solitude, till I pass away, [3332] of value and authority in the
   exposition of this subject.  Therefore, though they surpass all others
   in virtue, they fell further short of his mind than others fell short
   of their own, and while contributing little to the perfection of his
   priesthood, they gained in return greater assistance in contemplation.
   Whatever he thought, was a law for them, whatever on the contrary he
   disapproved, they abjured:  his decisions were to them the tables of
   Moses, [3333] and they paid him more reverence than is due from men to
   the Saints.  Aye, and when men came to hunt the Saint like a wild
   beast, and, after searching for him everywhere, failed to find him,
   they vouchsafed these emissaries not a single word, and offered their
   necks to the sword, as risking their lives for Christ's sake, and
   considering the most cruel sufferings on behalf of Athanasius to be an
   important step to contemplation, and far more divine and sublime than
   the long fasts and hard lying and mortifications in which they
   constantly revel.

   21.  Such were his surroundings when he approved the wise counsel of
   Solomon that there is a time to every purpose: [3334]   so he hid
   himself for a while, escaping during the time of war, to show himself
   when the time of peace came, as it did soon afterwards.  Meanwhile
   George, there being absolutely no one to resist him, overran Egypt, and
   desolated Syria, in the might of ungodliness.  He seized upon the East
   also as far as he could, ever attracting the weak, as torrents roll
   down objects in their course, and assailing the unstable or
   faint-hearted.  He won over also the simplicity of the Emperor, for
   thus I must term his instability, though I respect his pious motives.
   For, to say the truth, he had zeal, but not according to knowledge.
   [3335]   He purchased those in authority who were lovers of money
   rather than lovers of Christ--for he was well supplied with the funds
   for the poor, which he embezzled--especially the effeminate and unmanly
   men, [3336] of doubtful sex, but of manifest impiety; to whom, I know
   not how or why, Emperors of the Romans entrusted authority over men,
   though their proper function was the charge of women.  In this lay the
   power of that servant [3337] of the wicked one, that sower of tares,
   that forerunner of Antichrist; foremost in speech of the orators of his
   time among the Bishops; if any one likes to call him an orator who was
   not so much an impious, as he was a hostile and contentious
   reasoner,--his name I will gladly pass by:  he was the hand of his
   party, perverting the truth by the gold subscribed for pious uses,
   which the wicked made an instrument of their impiety.

   22.  The crowning feat of this faction was the council which sat first
   at Seleucia, the city of the holy and illustrious virgin Thekla, and
   afterwards at this mighty city, thus connecting their names, no longer
   with noble associations, but with these of deepest disgrace; whether we
   must call that council, which subverted and disturbed everything, a
   tower of Chalane, [3338] which deservedly confounded the tongues--would
   that theirs had been confounded for their harmony in evil!--or a
   Sanhedrim of Caiaphas [3339] where Christ was condemned, or some other
   like name.  The ancient and pious doctrine which defended the Trinity
   was abolished, by setting up a [3340] palisade and battering down the
   Consubstantial:  opening the door to impiety by means of what is
   written, using as their pretext, their reverence for Scripture and for
   the use of approved terms, but really introducing unscriptural
   Arianism.  For the phrase "like, according to the Scriptures," was a
   bait to the simple, concealing the hook of impiety, a figure seeming to
   look in the direction of all who passed by, a boot fitting either foot,
   a winnowing with every wind, [3341] gaining authority from the newly
   written villany and device against the truth.  For they were wise to do
   evil, but to do good they had no knowledge. [3342]

   23.  Hence came their pretended condemnation [3343] of the heretics,
   whom they renounced in words, in order to gain plausibility for their
   efforts, but in reality furthered; charging them not with unbounded
   impiety, but with exaggerated language.  Hence came the profane judges
   of the Saints, and the new combination, and public view and discussion
   of mysterious questions, and the illegal enquiry into the actions of
   life, and the hired informers, and the purchased sentences.  Some were
   unjustly deposed [3344] from their sees, others intruded, and among
   other necessary qualifications, made to sign the bonds of iniquity:
   the ink was ready, the informer at hand.  This the majority even of us,
   who were not overcome, had to endure, not falling in mind, though
   prevailed upon to sign, [3345] and so uniting with men who were in both
   respects wicked, and involving ourselves in the smoke, [3346] if not in
   the flame.  Over this I have often wept, when contemplating the
   confusion of impiety at that time, and the persecution of the orthodox
   teaching which now arose at the hands of the patrons of the Word.

   24.  For in reality, as the Scripture says, the shepherds became
   brutish, [3347] and many shepherds destroyed My vineyard, and defiled
   my pleasant portion, [3348] I mean the Church of God, which has been
   gathered together by the sweat and blood of many toilers and victims
   both before and after Christ, aye, even the great sufferings of God for
   us.  For with very few exceptions, and these either men who from their
   insignificance were disregarded, or from their virtue manfully
   resisted, being left unto Israel, [3349] as was ordained, for a seed
   and root, [3350] to blossom and come to life again amid the streams of
   the Spirit, everyone [3351] yielded to the influences of the time,
   distinguished only by the fact that some did so earlier, some later,
   that some became the champions and leaders of impiety, while such
   others were assigned a lower rank, as had been shaken by fear, enslaved
   by need, fascinated by flattery, or beguiled in ignorance; the last
   being the least guilty, if indeed we can allow even this to be a valid
   excuse for men entrusted with the leadership of the people.  For just
   as the force of lions and other animals, or of men and of women, or of
   old and of young men is not the same, but there is a considerable
   difference due to age or species--so it is also with rulers and their
   subjects.  For while we might pardon laymen in such a case, and often
   they escape, because not put to the test, yet how can we excuse a
   teacher, whose duty it is, unless he is falsely so-called, to correct
   the ignorance of others.  For is it not absurd, while no one, however
   great his boorishness and want of education, is allowed to be ignorant
   of the Roman law, and while there is no law in favour of sins of
   ignorance, that the teachers of the mysteries of salvation should be
   ignorant of the first principles of salvation, however simple and
   shallow their minds may be in regard to other subjects.  But, even
   granting indulgence to them who erred in ignorance, what can be said
   for the rest, who lay claim to subtlety of intellect, and yet yielded
   to the court-party for the reasons I have mentioned, and after playing
   the part of piety for a long while, failed in the hour of trial.

   25.  "Yet once more," [3352] I hear the Scripture say that the heaven
   and the earth shall be shaken, inasmuch as this has befallen them
   before, signifying, as I suppose, a manifest renovation of all things.
   And we must believe S. Paul when he says [3353] that this last shaking
   is none other than the second coming of Christ, and the transformation
   and changing of the universe to a condition of stability which cannot
   be shaken.  And I imagine that this present shaking, in which [3354]
   the contemplatives and lovers of God, who before the time exercise
   their heavenly citizenship, are shaken from us, is of no less
   consequence than any of former days.  For, however peaceful and
   moderate in other respects these men are, yet they cannot bear to carry
   their reasonableness so far as to be traitors to the cause of God for
   quietness' sake:  nay on this point they are excessively warlike and
   sturdy in fight; such is the heat of their zeal, that they would sooner
   proceed to excess in disturbance, than fail to notice anything that is
   amiss.  And no small portion of the people is breaking away with them,
   flying away, as a flock of birds does, with those who lead the flight,
   and even now does not cease to fly with them.

   26.  Such was Athanasius to us, when present, the pillar of the Church;
   and such, even when he retired before the insults of the wicked.  For
   those who have plotted the capture of some strong fort, when they see
   no other easy means of approaching or taking it, betake themselves to
   arts, and then, after seducing the commander by money or guile, without
   any effort possess themselves of the stronghold, or, if you will, as
   those who plotted against Samson first cut off his hair, [3355] in
   which his strength lay, and then seized upon the judge, and made sport
   of him at will, to requite him for his former power:  so did our
   foreign foes, after getting rid of our source of strength, and shearing
   off the glory of the Church, revel in like manner in utterances and
   deeds of impiety.  Then the supporter [3356] and patron of the hostile
   shepherd [3357] died, crowning [3358] his reign, which had not been
   evil, with an evil close, and unprofitably repenting, as they say, with
   his last breath, when each man, in view of the higher judgement seat,
   is a prudent judge of his own conduct.  For of these three evils, which
   were unworthy of his reign, he said that he was conscious, the murder
   of his kinsmen, the proclamation of the Apostate, and the innovation
   upon the faith; and with these words he is said to have departed.  Thus
   there was once more authority to teach the word of truth, and those who
   had suffered violence had now undisturbed freedom of speech, while
   jealousy was whetting the weapons of its wrath.  Thus it was with the
   people of Alexandria, who, with their usual impatience of the insolent,
   could not brook the excesses of the man, and therefore marked his
   wickedness by an unusual death, and his death by an unusual ignominy.
   For you know that camel, [3359] and its strange burden, and the new
   form of elevation, and the first and, I think, the only procession,
   with which to this day the insolent are threatened.

   27.  But when from this hurricane of unrighteousness, this corrupter of
   godliness, this precursor of the wicked one, such satisfaction had been
   exacted, in a way I cannot praise, for we must consider not what he
   ought to have suffered, but what we ought [3360] to do:  exacted
   however it was, as the result of the public anger and excitement:  and
   thereupon, our champion was restored from his illustrious banishment,
   for so I term his exile on behalf of, and under the blessing of, the
   Trinity, amid such delight of the people of the city and of almost all
   Egypt, that they ran together from every side, from the furthest limits
   of the country, simply to hear the voice of Athanasius, or feast their
   eyes upon the sight of him, nay even, as we are told of the Apostles,
   that they might be hallowed by the shadow [3361] and unsubstantial
   image of his body:  so that, many as are the honours, and welcomes
   bestowed on frequent occasions in the course of time upon various
   individuals, not only upon public rulers and bishops, but also upon the
   most illustrious of private citizens, not one has been recorded more
   numerously attended or more brilliant than this.  And only one honour
   can be compared with it by Athanasius himself, which had been conferred
   upon him on his former entrance into the city, when returning from the
   same exile for the same reasons.

   28.  With reference to this honour there was also current some such
   report as the following; for I will take leave to mention it, even
   though it be superfluous, as a kind of flavouring to my speech, or a
   flower scattered in honour of his entry.  After that entry, a certain
   officer, who had been twice Consul, was riding into the city; he was
   one of us, among the most noted of Cappadocians.  I am sure that you
   know that I mean Philagrius, who won upon our affections far beyond any
   one else, and was honoured as much as he was loved, if I may thus
   briefly set forth all his distinctions:  who had been for a second time
   entrusted with the government of the city, at the request of the
   citizens, by the decision of the Emperor.  Then one of the common
   people present, thinking the crowd enormous, like an ocean whose bound
   no eye can see, is reported to have said to one of his comrades and
   friends--as often happens in such a case--"Tell me, my good fellow,
   have you ever before seen the people pour out in such numbers and so
   enthusiastically to do honour to any one man?"  "No!" said the young
   man, "and I fancy that not even Constantius himself would be so
   treated;" indicating, by the mention of the Emperor, the climax of
   possible honour.  "Do you speak of that," said the other with a sweet
   and merry laugh, "as something wonderfully great?  I can scarcely
   believe that even the great Athanasius would be welcomed like this,"
   adding at the same time one of our native oaths in confirmation of his
   words.  Now the point of what he said, as I suppose you also plainly
   see, is this, that he set the subject of our eulogy before the Emperor
   himself.

   29.  So great was the reverence of all for the man, and so amazing even
   now seems the reception which I have described.  For if divided
   according to birth, age and profession, (and the city is most usually
   arranged in this way, when a public honour is bestowed on anyone) how
   can I set forth in words that mighty spectacle?  They formed one river,
   and it were indeed a poet's task to describe that Nile, of really
   golden stream and rich in crops, flowing back again from the city to
   the Chæreum, a day's journey, I take it, and more.  Permit me to revel
   a while longer in my description:  for I am going there, and it is not
   easy to bring back even my words from that ceremony.  He rode upon a
   colt, almost, blame me not for folly, as my Jesus did upon that other
   colt, [3362] whether it were the people of the Gentiles, whom He mounts
   in kindness, by setting it free from the bonds of ignorance, or
   something else, which the Scripture sets forth.  He was welcomed with
   branches of trees, and garments with many flowers and of varied hue
   were torn off and strewn before him and under his feet:  there alone
   was all that was glorious and costly and peerless treated with
   dishonour.  Like, once more, to the entry of Christ were those that
   went before with shouts and followed with dances; only the crowd which
   sung his praises was not of children only, but every tongue was
   harmonious, as men contended only to outdo one another.  I pass by the
   universal cheers, and the pouring forth of unguents, and the nightlong
   festivities, and the whole city gleaming with light, and the feasting
   in public and at home, and all the means of testifying to a city's joy,
   which were then in lavish and incredible profusion bestowed upon him.
   Thus did this marvellous man, with such a concourse, regain his own
   city.

   30.  He lived then as becomes the rulers of such a people, but did he
   fail to teach as he lived?  Were his contests out of harmony with his
   teaching?  Were his dangers less than those of men who have contended
   for any truth?  Were his honours inferior to the objects for which he
   contended?  Did he after his reception in any way disgrace that
   reception?  By no means.  Everything was harmonious, as an air upon a
   single lyre, and in the same key; his life, his teaching, his
   struggles, his dangers, his return, and his conduct after his return.
   For immediately on his restoration to his Church, he was not like those
   who are blinded by unrestrained passion, who, under the dominion of
   their anger, thrust away or strike at once whatever comes in their way,
   even though it might well be spared.  But, thinking this to be a
   special time for him to consult his reputation, since one who is
   ill-treated is usually restrained, and one who has the power to requite
   a wrong is ungoverned, he treated so mildly and gently those who had
   injured him, that even they themselves, if I may say so, did not find
   his restoration distasteful.

   31.  He cleansed the temple of those who made merchandise of God, and
   trafficked in the things of Christ, imitating Christ [3363] in this
   also; only it was with persuasive words, not with a twisted scourge
   that this was wrought.  He reconciled also those who were at variance,
   both with one another and with him, without the aid of any coadjutor.
   Those who had been wronged he set free from oppression, making no
   distinction as to whether they were of his own or of the opposite
   party.  He restored too the teaching which had been overthrown:  the
   Trinity was once more boldly spoken of, and set upon the lampstand,
   flashing with the brilliant light of the One Godhead into the souls of
   all.  He legislated again for the whole world, and brought all minds
   under his influence, by letters to some, by invitations to others,
   instructing some, who visited him uninvited, and proposing as the
   single law to all--Good will. [3364]   For this alone was able to
   conduct them to the true issue.  In brief, he exemplified the virtues
   of two celebrated stones--for to those who assailed him he was adamant,
   and to those at variance a magnet, which by some secret natural power
   draws iron to itself, and influences the hardest of substances.

   32.  But yet it was not likely that envy could brook all this, or see
   the Church restored again to the same glory and health as in former
   days, by the speedy healing over, as in the body, of the wounds of
   separation.  Therefore it was, that he raised up against Athanasius the
   Emperor, a rebel like himself, [3365] and his peer in villany, inferior
   to him only from lack of time, the first of Christian Emperors to rage
   against Christ, bringing forth all at once the basilisk of impiety with
   which he had long been in labour, when he obtained an opportunity, and
   shewing himself, at the time when he was proclaimed Emperor, to be a
   traitor to the Emperor who had entrusted him with the empire, and a
   traitor double dyed to the God who had saved him.  He devised the most
   inhuman of all the persecutions by blending speciousness with cruelty,
   in his envy of the honour won by the martyrs in their struggles; and so
   he called in question their repute for courage, by making verbal twists
   and quibbles a part of his character, or to speak the real truth,
   devoting himself to them with an eagerness born of his natural
   disposition, and imitating in varied craft the Evil one who dwelt
   within him.  The subjugation of the whole race of Christians he thought
   a simple task; but found it a great one to overcome Athanasius and the
   power of his teaching over us.  For he saw that no success could be
   gained in the plot against us, because of this man's resistance and
   opposition; the places of the Christians cut down being at once filled
   up, surprising though it seems, by the accession of Gentiles and the
   prudence of Athanasius.  In full view therefore of this, the crafty
   perverter and persecutor, clinging no longer to his cloak of illiberal
   sophistry, laid bare his wickedness and openly banished the Bishop from
   the city.  For the illustrious warrior must needs conquer in three
   struggles [3366] and thus make good his perfect title to fame.

   33.  Brief was the interval before Justice pronounced sentence, and
   handed over the offender [3367] to the Persians:  sending him forth an
   ambitious monarch--and bringing him back a corpse for which no one even
   felt pity; which, as I have heard, was not allowed to rest in the
   grave, but was shaken out and thrown up by the earth which he had
   shaken:  a prelude--I take it--to his future chastisement.  Then
   another king [3368] arose, [3369] not shameless in countenance like the
   former, nor an oppressor of Israel with cruel tasks and taskmasters,
   but most pious and gentle.  In order to lay the best of foundations for
   his empire, and begin, as is right, by an act of justice, he recalled
   from exile all the Bishops, but in the first place him who stood first
   in virtue and had conspicuously championed the cause of piety.
   Further, he inquired into the truth of our faith which had been torn
   asunder, confused, and parcelled out into various opinions and portions
   by many; with the intention, if it were possible, of reducing the whole
   world to harmony and union by the co-operation of the Spirit:  and,
   should he fail in this, of attaching himself to the best party, so as
   to aid and be aided by it, thus giving token of the exceeding loftiness
   and magnificence of his ideas on questions of the greatest moment.
   Here too was shown in a very high degree the simple-mindedness of
   Athanasius, and the steadfastness of his faith in Christ.  For, when
   all the rest who sympathised with us were divided into three parties,
   and many were faltering in their conception of the Son, and still more
   in that of the Holy Ghost, (a point on which to be only slightly in
   error was to be orthodox) and few indeed were sound upon both points,
   he was the first and only one, or with the concurrence of but a few, to
   venture to confess in writing, with entire clearness and distinctness,
   the Unity of Godhead and Essence of the Three Persons, and thus to
   attain in later days, under the influence of inspiration, to the same
   faith in regard to the Holy Ghost, as had been bestowed at an earlier
   time on most of the Fathers in regard to the Son.  This confession, a
   truly royal and magnificent gift, he presented to the Emperor, opposing
   to the unwritten innovation, a written account [3370] the orthodox
   faith, so that an emperor might be overcome by an emperor, reason by
   reason, treatise by treatise.

   34.  This confession was, it seems, greeted with respect by all, both
   in West and East, who were capable of life; some cherishing piety
   within their own bosoms, if we may credit what they say, but advancing
   no further, like a still-born child which dies within its mother's
   womb; others kindling to some extent, as it were, sparks, so far as to
   escape the difficulties of the time, arising either from the more
   fervent of the orthodox, or the devotion of the people; while others
   spoke the truth with boldness, on whose side I would be, for I dare
   make no further boast; no longer consulting my own fearfulness--in
   other words, the views of men more unsound than myself (for this we
   have done enough and to spare, without either gaining anything from
   others, or guarding from injury that which was our own, just as bad
   stewards do) but bringing forth to light my offspring, nourishing it
   with eagerness, and exposing it, in its constant growth, to the eyes of
   all.

   35.  This, however, is less admirable than his conduct.  What wonder
   that he, who had already made actual ventures on behalf of the truth,
   should confess it in writing?  Yet this point I will add to what has
   been said, as it seems to me especially wonderful and cannot with
   impunity be passed over in a time so fertile in disagreements as this.
   For his action, if we take note of him, will afford instruction even to
   the men of this day.  For as, in the case of one and the same quantity
   of water, there is separated from it, not only the residue which is
   left behind by the hand when drawing it, but also those drops, once
   contained in the hand, which trickle out through the fingers; so also
   there is a separation between us and, not only those who hold aloof in
   their impiety, but also those who are most pious, and that both in
   regard to such doctrines as are of small consequence (a matter of less
   moment) and also in regard to expressions intended to bear the same
   meaning.  We use in an orthodox sense the terms one Essence and three
   Hypostases, the one to denote the nature of the Godhead, the other the
   properties [3371] of the Three; the Italians [3372] mean the same, but,
   owing to the scantiness of their vocabulary, and its poverty of terms,
   they are unable to distinguish between Essence and Hypostases, and
   therefore introduce the term Persons, to avoid being understood to
   assert three Essences.  The result, were it not piteous, would be
   laughable.  This slight difference of sound was taken to indicate a
   difference of faith.  Then, Sabellianism was suspected in the doctrine
   of Three Persons, Arianism in that of Three Hypostases, both being the
   offspring of a contentious spirit.  And then, from the gradual but
   constant growth of irritation (the unfailing result of contentiousness)
   there was a danger of the whole world being torn asunder in the strife
   about syllables.  Seeing and hearing this, our blessed one, true man of
   God and great steward of souls as he was, felt it inconsistent with his
   duty to overlook so absurd and unreasonable a rending of the word, and
   applied his medicine to the disease.  In what manner?  He conferred in
   his gentle and sympathetic way with both parties, and after he had
   carefully weighed the meaning of their expressions, and found that they
   had the same sense, and were in nowise different in doctrine, by
   permitting each party to use its own terms, he bound them [3373]
   together in unity of action.

   36.  This in itself was more profitable than the long course of labours
   and teaching on which all writers enlarge, for in it somewhat of
   ambition mingled, and consequently, perhaps, somewhat of novelty in
   expressions.  This again was of more value than his many vigils and
   acts of discipline, [3374] the advantage of which is limited to those
   who perform them.  This was worthy of our hero's famous banishments and
   flights; for the object, in view of which he chose to endure such
   sufferings, he still pursued when the sufferings were past.  Nor did he
   cease to cherish the same ardour in others, praising some, gently
   rebuking others; rousing the sluggishness of these, restraining the
   passion of those; in some cases eager to prevent a fall, in others
   devising means of recovery after a fall; simple in disposition,
   manifold in the arts of government; clever in argument, more clever
   still in mind; condescending to the more lowly, outsoaring the more
   lofty; hospitable, [3375] protector of suppliants, averted of evils,
   really combining in himself alone the whole of the attributes parcelled
   out by the sons of Greece among their deities.  Further he was the
   patron of the wedded and virgin state alike, both peaceable and a
   peacemaker, and attendant upon those who are passing from hence.  Oh,
   how many a title does his virtue afford me, if I would detail its
   many-sided excellence.

   37.  After such a course, as taught and teacher, that his life and
   habits form the ideal of an Episcopate, and his teaching the law of
   orthodoxy, what reward does he win for his piety?  It is not indeed
   right to pass this by.  In a good old age he closed his life, [3376]
   and was gathered to his fathers, the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and
   Apostles, and Martyrs, who contended for the truth.  To be brief in my
   epitaph, the honours at his departure surpassed even those of his
   return from exile; the object of many tears, his glory, stored up in
   the minds of all, outshines all its visible tokens.  Yet, O thou dear
   and holy one, who didst thyself, with all thy fair renown, so
   especially illustrate the due proportions of speech and of silence, do
   thou stay here my words, falling short as they do of thy true meed of
   praise, though they have claimed the full exercise of all my powers.
   And mayest thou cast upon us from above a propitious glance, and
   conduct this people in its perfect worship of the perfect Trinity,
   which, as Father, Son, Holy Ghost, we contemplate and adore.  And
   mayest thou, if my lot be peaceful, possess and aid me in my pastoral
   charge, or if it pass through struggles, uphold me, or take me to thee,
   and set me with thyself and those like thee (though I have asked a
   great thing) in Christ Himself, our Lord, to whom be all glory, honour,
   and power for evermore.  Amen.

   Introduction to the "Theological" Orations.

   "It has been said with truth," says the writer of the Article on
   Gregory of Nazianzus in the Dictionary of Christian Biography, "that
   these discourses would lose their chief charm in a
   translation....Critics have rivalled each other in the praises they
   have heaped upon them, but no praise is so high as that of the many
   Theologians who have found in them their own best thoughts.  A Critic
   who cannot be accused of partiality towards Gregory has given in a few
   words perhaps the truest estimate of them:  A solidity of thought, the
   concentration of all that is spread through the writings of Hilary,
   Basil, and Athanasius, a flow of softened eloquence which does not halt
   or lose itself for a moment, an argument nervous without dryness on the
   one hand, and without useless ornament on the other, give these five
   Discourses a place to themselves among the monuments of this fine
   Genius, who was not always in the same degree free from grandiloquence
   and affectation.  In a few pages, and in a few hours, Gregory has
   summed up and closed the controversy of a whole Century.'" [3377]
   They were preached in the Church called Anastasia, [3378] at
   Constantinople, between 379 and 381, and have gained for their author
   the title of The Theologian, which he shares with S. John the
   Evangelist alone.  It should perhaps, however, be noted that the word
   is not here used in the wide and general sense in which we employ it,
   but in a narrower and more specific way, denoting emphatically the
   Defender of the Deity of the Logos.  His principal opponents were the
   followers of Eunomius and Macedonius, and it is almost entirely against
   them that these Orations on Theology, or the Godhead of the Word and
   the Holy Ghost, are directed.  The chief object of the Preacher in
   these and most other of his public utterances, is to maintain the
   Nicene Faith of the Trinity or Trinity of God; that is, the Doctrine
   that while there is but One Substance or Essence [3379] in the Godhead,
   and by consequence God is in the most absolute sense One, yet God is
   not Unipersonal, but within this Undivided Unity there are three
   Self-determining Subjects or Persons, distinguished from one another by
   special characteristics (idiotetes) or personal properties--Father,
   Son, and Holy Ghost.  With this object he entered into conflict with
   the heretics named above, who denied either the Consubstantiality of
   the Son with the Father, or the perfect Godhead and Personality of the
   Holy Ghost.

   Eunomius, whom Ullmann calls one of the most interesting heretics of
   the Fourth Century, was by birth a Cappadocian, and slightly older than
   Gregory.  As a young man he was a pupil and amanuensis of Aëtius, by
   whom the Arian heresy was developed to its extreme results.  The
   disciple never shrank from drawing the furthest logical conclusions
   from his master's premises, or from stating them with a frankness,
   which to those who regarded the premises themselves from which he
   reasoned as horrible blasphemies, seemed nothing less than diabolical
   in its impiety.  So precisely did he complete and formulate his
   teacher's heretical tenets, that the Anomoean Arians were ever
   afterwards called Eunomians, rather than Aëtians.  They asserted the
   absolute Unlikeness of the Being of the Father and of the Son.
   Starting with the conception of God as Absolute Being, of Whom no
   Generation can be predicated, Unbegotten and incapable of Begetting,
   they went on to say that an Eternal Generation is inconceivable, and
   that the Generation of the Son of God must have had a beginning.  Of
   course, therefore, the Arian conclusion followed, namely, that there
   was a time when the Son did not exist (en pote hote ouk en), and His
   Essence is altogether unlike that of the Unbegotten Father.  Equality
   of essence and Similarity of essence, are alike untenable, from the
   mere fact that the one Essence is Unbegotten, and the other is
   Begotten.  The Son, they said, is the First Creation of the Divine
   Energy, and is the Instrument by whom God created the world, and in
   this sense, as the Organ of creative power, may be said to be the
   Express Image and Likeness of the Energy of the Father. [3380]

   As they viewed the Holy Ghost as sharing the Divine Nature in an even
   remoter degree, as being only the noblest production of the
   Only-begotten Son, Eunomius was the first person heretically to
   discontinue the practice of threefold immersion in Holy Baptism.  He
   also corrupted the Form of that Sacrament, by setting aside the use of
   the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and baptizing people "in
   the name of the Creator, and into the death of Christ."  Therefore the
   Council of Constantinople ordered that converts from Eunomianism should
   be baptized, although those from other forms of Arianism were admitted
   into the Catholic Church by simple imposition of hands.  Through the
   influence of the followers of Aëtius, Eunomius became, in 360, Bishop
   of Cyzicus in Mysia, but he does not appear to have occupied the See
   very long.  At any rate when Gregory came, in 379, to Constantinople,
   he was living in retirement near Chalcedon.  All parties concur in
   representing him as a consummate Dialectician, but the Orthodox
   declared that he had turned Theology into a mere Technology.  Readiness
   of Dialectic was the great characteristic of his Sect, and it was they
   who introduced into the Capital that bad spirit of theological
   disputatiousness which Gregory deplores in the first of these famous
   Orations.  He also differed entirely from Gregory, not merely in the
   conclusions at which he arrived, but in the method by which he reached
   them; following the system of Aristotle, rather than of Plato, and
   using an exclusively intellectual method, while Gregory treated
   Religion as belonging to the entire man.  The point at issue between
   them, besides this of the Interior relations of the Three Blessed
   Persons within the Godhead, was mainly the question as to the complete
   comprehensibility of the Divine Nature, which the Eunomians maintained,
   and Gregory denied.  The latter argued that, while we have a sure
   conviction that God is, we have not a full understanding of What He
   is.  He would not, however, exclude us from all knowledge of God's
   Nature, only he limits our capacity to so much as God has been pleased
   to reveal to us of Himself.  "In my opinion," he says (Or. xxiv. 4),
   "it is impossible to express God, and yet more impossible to conceive
   Him--seeing that the thick covering of the flesh is an obstacle to the
   understanding of the truth."  Similarly in the Fourth of these Orations
   (Or. xxx. 17) he says, "The Deity cannot be expressed in words.  And
   this is proved to us, not only by arguments, but by the wisest and most
   ancient of the Hebrews, so far as they have given us reason for
   conjecture.  For they appropriated certain characters to the honour of
   the Deity, and would not even allow the name of anything inferior to
   God to be written with the same letters as that of God, because to
   their mind it was improper that the Deity should even to that extent
   admit any of His creatures to a share with Himself.  How then could
   they have admitted that the indivisible and separate Nature can be
   explained by divisible words?"

   In the mind of Gregory, the Orthodox doctrine of the Blessed Trinity is
   the fundamental dogma of Christianity, in contrast with all other
   religions, and with all heretical systems.  "Remember your confession,"
   he says to his hearers in an Oration against the Arians; "Into what
   were you baptized?  The Father?  Good, but still Jewish.  The Son?
   Good; no longer Jewish, but not yet perfect.  The Holy Ghost?  Very
   good; this is perfect.  Was it then simply into these, or was there
   some one common Name of these?  Yes, there was, and it is God."  And in
   the same oration he calls Arianism a new Judaism, because it ascribes
   full Deity only to the Father; and he speaks of One Nature in Three
   Individualities, intelligent, perfect, self-existent, distinct
   numerically, but one in Godhead.  "In created things," says Ullmann,
   "the several individuals are embraced in a common conception, though in
   themselves only connected together in thought, while in fact they are
   not one.  Manhood is only an intellectual conception; in fact there
   exist only Men.  But in the Godhead the Three Persons are not only in
   conception, but in fact, One; and this Unity is not only a relative but
   an absolute Unity, because the Divine Being is perfect in all Three
   Persons, and in all in a perfect equality.  In this sense therefore
   Gregory and all orthodox Trinitarians maintain the Unity of God.  But
   within this Unity there is a true Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
   a Trinity of Persons in a Unity of Nature."  We worship, he says (Or.
   xxxiii. 16), the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, One Nature in Three
   Individualities.  So that, as he says elsewhere (Or. in laud.
   Athanasii, xxi. 10), the Trinity is a true Trinity; not a numbering of
   unlike things, but a binding together of equals.  Each of the Persons
   is God in the fullest sense.  The Son and the Holy Ghost have their
   Source of Being in the Father, but in such sense that They are fully
   consubstantial with Him, and that neither of Them differs from Him in
   any particular of Essence.  The points of difference lie in the
   Personal Attributes; the Father Unoriginate, and Source of Deity; the
   Son deriving His Being eternally from the Father, and Himself the
   Source of all created existence; the Holy Ghost proceeding eternally
   from God, and sent into the world.

   In the first of these five discourses the Preacher sets himself to
   clear the ground for the fitting presentation of his great theme.  He
   endeavours to lay down the principles on which Theologians should
   proceed in such discussions, and very earnestly deprecates the habit of
   promiscuous argument in all sorts of places, upon all sorts of
   occasions, and before all sorts of hearers, of the deepest and most
   sacred truths and mysteries of the Faith.  They only should be allowed
   to engage in such conversation who are fitted for it by the practice of
   Christian virtue.  For others there are many other subjects upon which
   they can exercise their dialectical attainments, without doing or
   incurring any injury.

   In the second oration Gregory lays down the position referred to above,
   that it is impossible for even the most exalted human reason fully to
   grasp the Nature of God, though His Existence is patent to all.  We can
   only, he says, predicate negatives concerning Him.  He gives three
   reasons for this incapacity.  First to enhance our estimation of this
   knowledge, when attained hereafter; secondly to save us from the danger
   of falling through pride, like Lucifer, if we attained it prematurely;
   and thirdly, to support and sustain us in the trials and conflicts of
   this life, by the certainty that its attainment hereafter will be the
   reward of faithful service in them.  The cause of our present inability
   is the body with which our soul is united, the grossness of whose
   present condition hinders us from rising to the complete apprehension
   of the invisible and immaterial.  God, out of compassion for our
   weakness, has been pleased to designate Himself in Holy Scripture by
   various names taken from material objects, or from moral virtues; but
   these are only stepping-stones to the truth, and have indeed been
   sometimes perverted, and made a basis for polytheism.  It is, however,
   only natural that the Divine Essence should be shrouded in Mystery, for
   the same is the case with the created essences also.

   In the Third and Fourth he deals with the question of the Son.  His
   position may be summed up as follows:  The Son is absolutely of One
   Substance with the Father, and shares with Him all the Attributes of
   Godhead.  Yet He is a distinct Person, marked off by the fact that He
   is begotten of the Father.  But we must be careful not to allow this
   term "Begotten" to suggest to us any analogy with created things.  It
   is wholly independent of time and space and sense.

   This position he had to defend against many assailants, and especially
   against the Eunomians.  These heretics maintained that the use of this
   term necessarily implied a beginning of the Essence of the Son, and
   they asked the orthodox to tell them when that beginning took place.
   Gregory replies that the Generation of God the Son is beyond all time;
   pointing out that Paternity is an Essential attribute of God the
   Father, and therefore is as eternal as His Essence, so that there never
   was a time when He was not the Father, and consequently never a time
   when the Generation of the Son began.  He admits that there is a sense
   in which it is possible to say that the Son and the Spirit are not
   unoriginate, but then you must be careful not to use the word Origin in
   the sense of Beginning, but in that of Cause.  They derive Their Being
   eternally from the Father, and all Three Persons are coeternal
   together.  In respect of cause They are not unoriginate, but the cause
   is not necessarily prior in time to its effect, just as the Sun is not
   prior to its own light.  In respect of time, then, They may be said to
   be unoriginate, for the Sources of time cannot be subject to time.  "If
   the Father has not ceased to beget, His Generation is an imperfect one;
   and if He has ceased, He must have begun, for an end implies a
   beginning."  "Not so," says Gregory, "unless you are prepared to admit
   that what has no end has necessarily no beginning; and in that case
   what will you say about the Angels, or the human soul?  These will have
   no end; had either of them therefore no beginning?"  By a similar
   process of Reductio ad absurdum he dissipates all the quibbles of
   Eunomian sophistry, and lays down the orthodox Faith of the Church.
   Then in the remainder of the Third and Fourth Orations he goes on to
   examine the Scriptural testimony adduced by his opponents, and to shew
   by a similar catena on the other side that the overwhelming
   preponderance of the authority of the Bible is clearly against them.
   In connection with this point he lays down the canon that in the
   interpretation of Scripture in regard to our Lord, all expressions
   savouring of humility or weakness are to be referred to that pure
   Humanity which He assumed for our sake; while all that speaks of
   Majesty and Power belongs to His Godhead.

   In the Fifth he deals with the doctrine of the Holy Ghost.  The heresy
   of Arius was at first directly concerned only with the Person of our
   Lord, though not without a side-glance at that also of the Holy Ghost.
   The Council of Nicæa had confined itself to the first question, and its
   Creed ended with, "We believe in the Holy Ghost."  This, it was
   afterwards argued, was enough to proclaim His Divinity, and so Gregory
   argues in this Oration, "If He be only a creature, how do we believe on
   Him, how are we made perfect in Him, for the first of these belongs to
   Deity, the second may be said of anything" (c. vi.).  The reason,
   however, that the Great Synod made no express definition on the point
   seems to have been that the controversy had not yet been carried so far
   in direct terms (cf. S. Basil, Epp. lxxviii. ccclxxxvii.).  But fifty
   years later the growth of the heresy rendered a definition of the
   Church's faith on this point needful; and in 363, on his return from
   his fourth period of exile, S. Athanasius held a provincial Synod at
   Alexandria, in whose Synodical Letter to the Emperor Jovian the Godhead
   of the Holy Ghost is maintained in terms which, as Canon Bright says,
   partly anticipate the language of the Creed of Constantinople (Dict.
   Biog. Art. Athanasius).  The new development of the heresy had begun to
   appear at Constantinople as well as in Thrace and Asia Minor.
   Macedonius, a Semi-Arian, had been elected Bishop of Constantinople in
   341, and in spite of violent opposition, which he met by still more
   violent measures, had maintained his position till 360, when he was
   deposed and driven out by the Anomoean Arians.  He then in his
   retirement became the leader of the Semi-Arian party.  Accepting the
   statement that the Son was Like in Essence to the Father, he would not
   concede even this to the Holy Ghost, but declared Him to be a mere
   creature (Thdt. Hist. Eccl. ii. 6), and the servant or minister of the
   Son; applying to Him terms which without error could only be used of
   the Angels (Sozomen. H. E. iv. 27).  His followers were known as
   Macedonians, or sometimes Marathonians, from a certain Marathonius,
   formerly a Paymaster of the Prætorian Guards, who had become a Deacon
   of Constantinople, and, having done much in the way of founding and
   maintaining Monastic Houses and Houses of Charity in the City, was
   consecrated by Macedonius as Bishop of Nicomedia.  They were also known
   as Pneumatomachi, from the nature of their Heresy.  A controversy had
   now begun to arise as to the precise position which the true faith was
   to assign to the Holy Spirit.  There were those who left it doubtful
   whether He had indeed a separate Personality, or whether He were not
   rather a mere Influence or Activity of the Father and the Son.  Gregory
   tells us how, when he came to the Metropolis, he found the wildest
   confusion prevalent.  Some, he says, conceived of the Holy Ghost as a
   mere Energy of God, others thought Him a Creature, others believed Him
   to be God; while many out of an alleged reverence for Holy Scripture,
   hesitated to give Him the Name of God.  To this last class belonged,
   according to Socrates (H. E. ii. 45), Eustathius, who had been ejected
   from the Bishopric of Sebasteia in Pontus.  He refused to admit that
   the Holy Spirit is God, while yet He did not dare to affirm that He is
   a mere creature.  When Gregory proceeded to preach the Deity of the
   Spirit, he was accused of introducing a strange and unscriptural god,
   because, as he acknowledges, the letter of the Bible is not so clear on
   the doctrine of the Spirit as it is on that of the Son.  But he points
   out that it is possible to be superstitious in one's reverence for the
   letter of the Bible, and that such superstition leads directly to
   heresy.  He explains the reticence of the New Testament on this point
   by shewing (in this Oration, cc. 26, 27) how God's Self-Revelation to
   man has always been a gradual one; how the Old Testament revealed the
   Father clearly, with obscure hints about the Son; and the New Testament
   manifested the Son, but only hinted at the Godhead of the Spirit; but
   now, he says, the Spirit dwells among us, and allows us to recognize
   Him more clearly.  For it would not have been advisable, as long as the
   Godhead of the Father was not acknowledged, to proclaim that of the
   Son; and while the Deity of the Son was not yet accepted, to add
   another burden in that of the Holy Spirit.  Recognizing thus a Divine
   economy in the Self-Revelations of God, he was not averse to using a
   similar caution in his own dealings with weak or ill-instructed minds.
   [3381]   But yet when real necessity arose, he could speak out with
   perfect plainness on this subject; and he even incurred danger to life
   and limb from the violence of the opposing party.  He met their
   opposition by the clearest statements of the Catholic Dogma.  "Is the
   Spirit God?" he asks.  "Yes."  "But is He consubstantial?"  "Yes, if He
   is God."  (Orat. xxxi. 10.)  He appeals both to the Bible, and to the
   experience of the Christian life.  If the Spirit is not to be adored,
   how can He deify me in Baptism?  From the Spirit comes our new Birth;
   from the new Birth our new Life; and from the new Life our knowledge of
   the Dignity of Him from Whom it is derived (Ibid. C. 29).  He is,
   however, milder in his treatment of these heretics than of the strict
   Arians, both, as he says, because they approached more nearly to the
   Orthodox belief on the subject of the Son, and because their
   conspicuous piety of life shewed that their error was not altogether
   wilful.  In this Oration he shows that though the Name of God may not
   actually be given in the New Testament to the Holy Ghost, yet all the
   attributes of God are ascribed to Him, and that therefore the use of
   the Name is a matter of legitimate inference.  He carries on the
   argument in the Oration on Pentecost (No. XLI.  See the Introduction to
   that Oration in the present Volume).

   With regard to the doctrine of the Procession, Gregory gives us no
   clear information.  He is silent as to the Procession from the Son.  It
   is enough for him that the Spirit is not Begotten but Proceeding (in
   SS. Lumina, c. 12), and that Procession is His distinctive Property,
   which involves at once His Personality and His Essential Deity.

   At length in 381 the work of local Synods and episcopal conferences was
   completed and clinched by the Ruling of a Second Ecumenical Council.
   It is true that the Council which Theodosius summoned to meet at
   Constantinople could scarcely have regarded itself as possessing
   Ecumenical authority; whilst in the West it certainly was not regarded
   in this light before the Sixth Century.  Nevertheless the honours of
   Ecumenicity were ultimately awarded to it by the whole Church, because
   it completes the series of Great Councils by which the Doctrine of the
   Deity of the Holy Spirit was affirmed; and in fact it expressed the
   final judgment of the Catholic Church upon the Macedonian controversy.
   Its first Canon anathematises the Semiarians or Pneumatomachi by name
   as well as the Eunomians or Anomoean Arians (cf. Dict. Biog. Art.
   Gregory of Nazianzus, by Dr. H. B. Swete).

   [3377] De Broglie, "L'Eglise et l'Empire," v. 385.--"Ce sont autant de
   modèles dans l'art délicat d'imprimer la forme oratoire aux
   développements philosophiques.  Une pensée substantielle, formée de
   tous les sucs répandus dans les écrits d'Hilaire, de Basile et
   d'Athanase; un courant d'éloquence tempérée qui ne se ralentit, ni ne
   s'égare en aucun moment; une argumentation nerveuse sans sècheresse,
   mais sans vaine parure d'ornements, font à ces cinq discours une place
   à part parmi les monuments de ce beau génie, auquel l'emphase et
   l'affectation ne furent pas toujours aussi étrangers.  En quelques
   pages, et en quelques heures, Grégoire avait résumé et clos la
   controverse de tout un siècle."

   [3378] See Prolegomena p. 171.

   [3379] "There is but one divine Essence or Substance; Father, Son, and
   Spirit, are one in essence, or consubstantial.  They are in one
   another, inseparable, and cannot be conceived without each other.  In
   this point the Nicene doctrine is thoroughly monotheistic, or
   monarchian, in distinction from tritheism, which is but a new form of
   the polytheism of the pagans. "The terms Essence (ousia) and Nature
   (phusis), in the philosophical sense, denote not an individual, a
   personality, but the Genus or Species; not Unum in Numero, but Ens Unum
   in Multis.  All men are of the same substance, partake of the same
   human nature; though as persons and individuals they are very
   different.  The term Homo-ousion, in its strict grammatical sense,
   differs from Mono-ousion or Touto-ousion, as well as from
   Hetero-ousion, and signifies not numerical identity, but equality of
   essence or community of nature among several beings.  It is clearly
   thus used in the Chalcedonian Symbol, where it is said that Christ is
   consubstantial (Homo-ousios) with the Father as touching the Godhead,
   and consubstantial with us (and yet individually distinct from us) as
   touching the Manhood.'  But in the Divine Trinity consubstantiality
   denotes not only sameness of kind, but at the same time Numerical
   unity; not merely the Unum in Specie, but also the Unum in Numero.  The
   three Persons are related to the Divine Substance not as three
   individuals to their species, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or Peter,
   John, and Paul, to human nature; they are only one God.  The divine
   Substance is absolutely indivisible by reason of its simplicity, and
   absolutely inextensible and untransferable by reason of its infinity;
   whereas a corporeal substance can be divided, and the human nature can
   be multiplied by generation.  Three Divine substances would limit and
   exclude each other, and therefore could not be infinite or absolute.
   The whole fulness of the one undivided Essence of God, with all its
   attributes, is in all the Persons of the Trinity, though in each in His
   own way; in the Father as Original Principle, in the Son by eternal
   Generation, in the Spirit by eternal Procession.  The Church teaches
   not One Divine Essence and Three Persons, but One Essence In Three
   Persons.  Father, Son, and Spirit cannot be conceived as Three separate
   individuals, but are in one another, and form a solidaric Unity."
   (Schaff, History of the Church, Nic. & Post-Nic. Period, Div. ii. p.
   672.)

   [3380] Two terms borrowed from Holy Scripture (Heb. i. 3).  But
   observe, borrowed with a difference--not "the Image of His Substance,"
   which they would not admit, but of His "Energy," which is a very
   different conception.

   [3381] In his Fifty-third Epistle, addressed to S. Basil, there is an
   amusing instance of his defence of this tolerant disposition, which S.
   Basil also displayed in dealing with minds of this class.

   Oration XXVII.

   The First Theological Oration.

   A Preliminary Discourse Against the Eunomians.

   I.  I am to speak against persons who pride themselves on their
   eloquence; so, to begin with a text of Scripture, "Behold, I am against
   thee, O thou proud one," [3382] not only in thy system of teaching, but
   also in thy hearing, and in thy tone of mind.  For there are certain
   persons who have not only their ears [3383] and their tongues, but
   even, as I now perceive, their hands too, itching for our words; who
   delight in profane babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so
   called, [3384] and strifes about words, which tend to no profit; for so
   Paul, the Preacher and Establisher of the "Word cut short," [3385] the
   disciple and teacher of the Fishermen, [3386] calls all that is
   excessive or superfluous in discourse.  But as to those to whom we
   refer, would that they, whose tongue is so voluble and clever in
   applying itself to noble and approved language, would likewise pay some
   attention to actions.  For then perhaps in a little while they would
   become less sophistical, and less absurd and strange acrobats of words,
   if I may use a ridiculous expression about a ridiculous subject.

   II.  But since they neglect every path of righteousness, and look only
   to this one point, namely, which of the propositions submitted to them
   they shall bind or loose, (like those persons who in the theatres
   perform wrestling matches in public, but not that kind of wrestling in
   which the victory is won according to the rules of the sport, but a
   kind to deceive the eyes of those who are ignorant in such matters, and
   to catch applause), and every marketplace must buzz with their talking;
   and every dinner party be worried to death with silly talk and boredom;
   and every festival be made unfestive and full of dejection, and every
   occasion of mourning be consoled by a greater calamity [3387] --their
   questions--and all the women's apartments accustomed to simplicity be
   thrown into confusion and be robbed of its flower of modesty by the
   torrent of their words...since, I say this is so, the evil is
   intolerable and not to be borne, and our Great Mystery is in danger of
   being made a thing of little moment.  Well then, let these spies [3388]
   bear with us, moved as we are with fatherly compassion, and as holy
   Jeremiah says, torn in our hearts; [3389] let them bear with us so far
   as not to give a savage reception to our discourse upon this subject;
   and let them, if indeed they can, restrain their tongues for a short
   while and lend us their ears.  However that may be, you shall at any
   rate suffer no loss.  For either we shall have spoken in the ears of
   them that will hear, [3390] and our words will bear some fruit, namely
   an advantage to you (since the Sower soweth the Word [3391] upon every
   kind of mind; and the good and fertile bears fruit), or else you will
   depart despising this discourse of ours as you have despised others,
   and having drawn from it further material for gainsaying and railing at
   us, upon which to feast yourselves yet more.

   And you must not be astonished if I speak a language which is strange
   to you and contrary to your custom, who profess to know everything and
   to teach everything in a too impetuous and generous manner...not to
   pain you by saying ignorant and rash.

   III.  Not to every one, my friends, does it belong to philosophize
   about God; not to every one; the Subject is not so cheap and low; and I
   will add, not before every audience, nor at all times, nor on all
   points; but on certain occasions, and before certain persons, and
   within certain limits.

   Not to all men, because it is permitted only to those who have been
   examined, and are passed masters in meditation, and who have been
   previously purified in soul and body, or at the very least are being
   purified.  For the impure to touch the pure is, we may safely say, not
   safe, just as it is unsafe to fix weak eyes upon the sun's rays.  And
   what is the permitted occasion?  It is when we are free from all
   external defilement or disturbance, and when that which rules within us
   is not confused with vexatious or erring images; like persons mixing up
   good writing with bad, or filth with the sweet odours of unguents.  For
   it is necessary to be truly at leisure to know God; and when we can get
   a convenient season, to discern the straight road of the things
   divine.  And who are the permitted persons?  They to whom the subject
   is of real concern, and not they who make it a matter of pleasant
   gossip, like any other thing, after the races, or the theatre, or a
   concert, or a dinner, or still lower employments.  To such men as
   these, idle jests and pretty contradictions about these subjects are a
   part of their amusement.

   IV.  Next, on what subjects and to what extent may we philosophize?  On
   matters within our reach, and to such an extent as the mental power and
   grasp of our audience may extend.  No further, lest, as excessively
   loud sounds injure the hearing, or excess of food the body, or, if you
   will, as excessive burdens beyond the strength injure those who bear
   them, or excessive rains the earth; so these too, being pressed down
   and overweighted by the stiffness, if I may use the expression, of the
   arguments should suffer loss even in respect of the strength they
   originally possessed. [3392]

   V.  Now, I am not saying that it is not needful to remember God at all
   times;...I must not be misunderstood, or I shall be having these nimble
   and quick people down upon me again.  For we ought to think of God even
   more often than we draw our breath; and if the expression is
   permissible, we ought to do nothing else.  Yea, I am one of those who
   entirely approve that Word which bids us meditate day and night, [3393]
   and tell at eventide and morning and noon day, [3394] and praise the
   Lord at every time; [3395] or, to use Moses' words, whether a man lie
   down, or rise up, or walk by the way, or whatever else he be doing
   [3396] --and by this recollection we are to be moulded to purity.  So
   that it is not the continual remembrance of God that I would hinder,
   but only the talking about God; nor even that as in itself wrong, but
   only when unseasonable; nor all teaching, but only want of moderation.
   As of even honey repletion and satiety, though it be of honey, produce
   vomiting; [3397] and, as Solomon says and I think, there is a time for
   every thing, [3398] and that which is good ceases to be good if it be
   not done in a good way; just as a flower is quite out of season in
   winter, and just as a man's dress does not become a woman, nor a
   woman's a man; and as geometry is out of place in mourning, or tears at
   a carousal; shall we in this instance alone disregard the proper time,
   in a matter in which most of all due season should be respected?
   Surely not, my friends and brethren (for I will still call you
   Brethren, though you do not behave like brothers).  Let us not think so
   nor yet, like hot tempered and hard mouthed horses, throwing off our
   rider Reason, and casting away Reverence, that keeps us within due
   limits, run far away from the turning point, [3399] but let us
   philosophize within our proper bounds, and not be carried away into
   Egypt, nor be swept down into Assyria [3400] , nor sing the Lord's song
   in a strange land, by which I mean before any kind of audience,
   strangers or kindred, hostile or friendly, kindly or the reverse, who
   watch what we do with over great care, and would like the spark of what
   is wrong in us to become a flame, and secretly kindle and fan it and
   raise it to heaven with their breath and make it higher than the
   Babylonian flame which burnt up every thing around it.  For since their
   strength lies not in their own dogmas, they hunt for it in our weak
   points.  And therefore they apply themselves to our--shall I say
   "misfortunes" or "failings"?--like flies to wounds.  But let us at
   least be no longer ignorant of ourselves, or pay too little attention
   to the due order in these matters.  And if it be impossible to put an
   end to the existing hostility, let us at least agree upon this, that we
   will utter Mysteries under our breath, and holy things in a holy
   manner, and we will not cast to ears profane that which may not be
   uttered, nor give evidence that we possess less gravity than those who
   worship demons, and serve shameful fables and deeds; for they would
   sooner give their blood to the uninitiated than certain words.  But let
   us recognize that as in dress and diet and laughter and demeanour there
   is a certain decorum, so there is also in speech and silence; since
   among so many titles and powers of God, we pay the highest honour to
   The Word.  Let even our disputings then be kept within bounds.

   VI.  Why should a man who is a hostile listener to such words be
   allowed to hear about the Generation of God, or his creation, or how
   God was made out of things which had no existence, or of section and
   analysis and division? [3401]   Why do we make our accusers judges?
   Why do we put swords into the hands of our enemies?  How, thinkest
   thou, or with what temper, will the arguments about such subjects be
   received by one who approves of adulteries, and corruption of children,
   and who worships the passions and cannot conceive of aught higher than
   the body...who till very lately set up gods for himself, and gods too
   who were noted for the vilest deeds?  Will it not first be from a
   material standpoint, shamefully and ignorantly, and in the sense to
   which he has been accustomed?  Will he not make thy Theology a defence
   for his own gods and passions?  For if we ourselves wantonly misuse
   these words, [3402] it will be a long time before we shall persuade
   them to accept our philosophy.  And if they are in their own persons
   inventors of evil things, how should they refrain from grasping at such
   things when offered to them?  Such results come to us from mutual
   contest.  Such results follow to those who fight for the Word beyond
   what the Word approves; they are behaving like mad people, who set
   their own house on fire, or tear their own children, or disavow their
   own parents, taking them for strangers.

   VII.  But when we have put away from the conversation those who are
   strangers to it, and sent the great legion [3403] on its way to the
   abyss into the herd of swine, the next thing is to look to ourselves,
   and polish our theological self to beauty like a statue.  The first
   point to be considered is--What is this great rivalry of speech and
   endless talking?  What is this new disease of insatiability?  Why have
   we tied our hands and armed our tongues?  We do not praise either
   hospitality, or brotherly love, or conjugal affection, or virginity;
   nor do we admire liberality to the poor, or the chanting of Psalms, or
   nightlong vigils, [3404] or tears.  We do not keep under the body by
   fasting, or go forth to God by prayer; nor do we subject the worse to
   the better--I mean the dust to the spirit--as they would do who form a
   just judgment of our composite nature; we do not make our life a
   preparation for death; nor do we make ourselves masters of our
   passions, mindful of our heavenly nobility; nor tame our anger when it
   swells and rages, nor our pride that bringeth to a fall, nor
   unreasonable grief, nor unchastened pleasure, nor meretricious
   laughter, nor undisciplined eyes, nor insatiable ears, nor excessive
   talk, nor absurd thoughts, nor aught of the occasions which the Evil
   One gets against us from sources within ourselves; bringing upon us the
   death that comes through the windows, [3405] as Holy Scripture saith;
   that is, through the senses.  Nay we do the very opposite, and have
   given liberty to the passions of others, as kings give releases from
   service in honour of a victory, only on condition that they incline to
   our side, and make their assault upon God more boldly, or more
   impiously.  And we give them an evil reward for a thing which is not
   good, license of tongue for their impiety.

   VIII.  And yet, O talkative Dialectician, I will ask thee one small
   question, [3406] and answer thou me, as He saith to Job, Who through
   whirlwind and cloud giveth Divine admonitions. [3407]   Are there many
   mansions in God's House, as thou hast heard, or only one?  Of course
   you will admit that there are many, and not only one.  Now, are they
   all to be filled, or only some, and others not; so that some will be
   left empty, and will have been prepared to no purpose?  Of course all
   will be filled, for nothing can be in vain which has been done by God.
   And can you tell me what you will consider this Mansion to be?  Is it
   the rest and glory which is in store There for the Blessed, or
   something else?--No, not anything else.  Since then we are agreed upon
   this point, let us further examine another also.  Is there any thing
   that procures these Mansions, as I think there is; or is there
   nothing?--Certainly there is--What is it?  Is it not that there are
   various modes of conduct, and various purposes, one leading one way,
   another another way, according to the proportion of faith, and these we
   call Ways?  Must we, then, travel all, or some of these Ways...the same
   individual along them all, if that be possible; or, if not, along as
   many as may be; or else along some of them?  And even if this may not
   be, it would still be a great thing, at least as it appears to me, to
   travel excellently along even one.--"You are right in your
   conception."--What then when you hear there is but One way, and that a
   narrow one, [3408] does the word seem to you to shew?  That there is
   but one on account of its excellence.  For it is but one, even though
   it be split into many parts.  And narrow because of its difficulties,
   and because it is trodden by few in comparison with the multitude of
   the adversaries, and of those who travel along the road of wickedness.
   "So I think too."  Well, then, my good friend, since this is so, why do
   you, as though condemning our doctrine for a certain poverty, rush
   headlong down that one which leads through what you call arguments and
   speculations, but I frivolities and quackeries?  Let Paul reprove you
   with those bitter reproaches, in which, after his list of the Gifts of
   Grace, he says, Are all Apostles?  Are all Prophets? etc. [3409]

   IX.  But, be it so.  Lofty thou art, even beyond the lofty, even above
   the clouds, if thou wilt, a spectator of things invisible, a hearer of
   things unspeakable; one who hast ascended after Elias, and who after
   Moses hast been deemed worthy of the Vision of God, and after Paul hast
   been taken up into heaven; why dost thou mould the rest of thy fellows
   in one day into Saints, and ordain them Theologians, and as it were
   breathe into them instruction, and make them many councils of ignorant
   oracles?  Why dost thou entangle those who are weaker in thy spider's
   web, if it were something great and wise?  Why dost thou stir up wasps'
   nests against the Faith?  Why dost thou suddenly spring a flood of
   dialectics upon us, as the fables of old did the Giants?  Why hast thou
   collected all that is frivolous and unmanly among men, like a rabble,
   into one torrent, and having made them more effeminate by flattery,
   fashioned a new workshop, cleverly making a harvest for thyself out of
   their want of understanding?  Dost thou deny that this is so, and are
   the other matters of no account to thee?  Must thy tongue rule at any
   cost, and canst thou not restrain the birthpang of thy speech?  Thou
   mayest find many other honourable subjects for discussion.  To these
   turn this disease of thine with some advantage.  Attack the silence of
   Pythagoras, [3410] and the Orphic beans, and the novel brag about "The
   Master said."  Attack the ideas of Plato, [3411] and the
   transmigrations and courses of our souls, and the reminiscences, and
   the unlovely loves of the soul for lovely bodies.  Attack the atheism
   of Epicurus, [3412] and his atoms, and his unphilosophic pleasure; or
   Aristotle's petty Providence, and his artificial system, and his
   discourses about the mortality of the soul, and the humanitarianism of
   his doctrine.  Attack the superciliousness of the Stoa, [3413] or the
   greed and vulgarity of the Cynic. [3414]   Attack the "Void and Full"
   (what nonsense), and all the details about the gods and the sacrifices
   and the idols and demons, whether beneficent or malignant, and all the
   tricks that people play with divination, evoking of gods, or of souls,
   and the power of the stars.  And if these things seem to thee unworthy
   of discussion as petty and already often confuted, and thou wilt keep
   to thy line, and seek the satisfaction of thy ambition in it; then here
   too I will provide thee with broad paths.  Philosophize about the world
   or worlds; about matter; about soul; about natures endowed with reason,
   good or bad; about resurrection, about judgment, about reward, or the
   Sufferings of Christ.  For in these subjects to hit the mark is not
   useless, and to miss it is not dangerous.  But with God we shall have
   converse, in this life only in a small degree; but a little later, it
   may be, more perfectly, in the Same, our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be
   glory for ever.  Amen.

   posts were set up called nussai, or in Latin Metæ, round which the cars
   were to turn.  The object of the charioteers was to turn round these as
   close as possible, to save distance; and to do this well it was
   necessary to have the horses under perfect control, as well as
   perfectly trained, to make the semicircle at full gallop almost on the
   axis of the car.  The horses that got out of hand and galloped wildly

   their peregrinations; and when asked for proof of their peculiar
   doctrines, contented themselves with the reply, "autos etha" "the
   master said so."

   [3411] Plato taught that all things that exist are copies of certain
   objective archetypal Forms, emanations from the Mind of God, which God
   copied in creation.  He also taught a doctrine of transmigration of

     __________________________________________________________________

   Oration XXVIII.

   The Second Theological Oration.

   I.  In the former Discourse we laid down clearly with respect to the
   Theologian, both what sort of character he ought to bear, and on what
   kind of subject he may philosophize, and when, and to what extent.  We
   saw that he ought to be, as far as may be, pure, in order that light
   may be apprehended by light; and that he ought to consort with serious
   men, in order that his word be not fruitless through falling on an
   unfruitful soil; and that the suitable season is when we have a calm
   within from the whirl of outward things; so as not like madmen [3415]
   to lose our breath; and that the extent to which we may go is that to
   which we have ourselves advanced, or to which we are advancing.  Since
   then these things are so, and we have broken up for ourselves the
   fallows of Divinity [3416] , so as not to sow upon thorns, [3417] and
   have made plain the face of the ground, [3418] being moulded and
   moulding others by Holy Scripture...let us now enter upon Theological
   questions, setting at the head thereof the Father, the Son, and the
   Holy Ghost, of Whom we are to treat; that the Father may be well
   pleased, and the Son may help us, and the Holy Ghost may inspire us; or
   rather that one illumination may come upon us from the One God, One in
   diversity, diverse in Unity, wherein is a marvel.

   II.  Now when I go up eagerly into the Mount [3419] --or, to use a
   truer expression, when I both eagerly long, and at the same time am
   afraid (the one through my hope and the other through my weakness) to
   enter within the Cloud, and hold converse with God, for so God
   commands; if any be an Aaron, let him go up with me, and let him stand
   near, being ready, if it must be so, to remain outside the Cloud.  But
   if any be a Nadad or an Abihu, or of the Order of the Elders, let him
   go up indeed, but let him stand afar off, according to the value of his
   purification.  But if any be of the multitude, who are unworthy of this
   height of contemplation, if he be altogether impure let him not
   approach at all, [3420] for it would be dangerous to him; but if he be
   at least temporarily purified, let him remain below and listen to the
   Voice alone, and the trumpet, [3421] the bare words of piety, and let
   him see the Mountain smoking and lightening, a terror at once and a
   marvel to those who cannot get up.  But if any is an evil and savage
   beast, and altogether incapable of taking in the subject matter of
   Contemplation and Theology, let him not hurtfully and malignantly lurk
   in his den among the woods, to catch hold of some dogma or saying by a
   sudden spring, and to tear sound doctrine to pieces by his
   misrepresentations, but let him stand yet afar off and withdraw from
   the Mount, or he shall be stoned and crushed, and shall perish
   miserably in his wickedness.  For to those who are like wild beasts
   true and sound discourses are stones.  If he be a leopard let him die
   with his spots. [3422]   If a ravening and roaring lion, seeking what
   he may devour [3423] of our souls or of our words; or a wild boar,
   trampling under foot the precious and translucent pearls of the Truth;
   [3424] or an Arabian [3425] and alien wolf, or one keener even than
   these in tricks of argument; or a fox, that is a treacherous and
   faithless soul, changing its shape according to circumstances or
   necessities, feeding on dead or putrid bodies, or on little vineyards
   [3426] when the large ones have escaped them; or any other carnivorous
   beast, rejected by the Law as unclean for food or enjoyment; our
   discourse must withdraw from such and be engraved on solid tables of
   stone, and that on both sides because the Law is partly visible, and
   partly hidden; the one part belonging to the mass who remain below, the
   other to the few who press upward into the Mount.

   III.  What is this that has happened to me, O friends, and initiates,
   and fellow-lovers of the truth?  I was running to lay hold on God, and
   thus I went up into the Mount, and drew aside the curtain of the Cloud,
   and entered away from matter and material things, and as far as I could
   I withdrew within myself.  And then when I looked up, I scarce saw the
   back parts of God; [3427] although I was sheltered by the Rock, the
   Word that was made flesh for us.  And when I looked a little closer, I
   saw, not the First and unmingled Nature, known to Itself--to the
   Trinity, I mean; not That which abideth within the first [3428] veil,
   and is hidden by the Cherubim; but only that Nature, which at last even
   reaches to us.  And that is, as far as I can learn, the Majesty, or as
   holy David calls it, the Glory [3429] which is manifested among the
   creatures, which It has produced and governs.  For these are the Back
   Parts of God, which He leaves behind Him, as tokens of Himself [3430]
   like the shadows and reflection of the sun in the water, which shew the
   sun to our weak eyes, because we cannot look at the sun himself, for by
   his unmixed light he is too strong for our power of perception.  In
   this way then shalt thou discourse of God; even wert thou a Moses and a
   god to Pharaoh; [3431] even wert thou caught up like Paul to the Third
   Heaven, [3432] and hadst heard unspeakable words; even wert thou raised
   above them both, and exalted to Angelic or Archangelic place and
   dignity.  For though a thing be all heavenly, or above heaven, and far
   higher in nature and nearer to God than we, yet it is farther distant
   from God, and from the complete comprehension of His Nature, than it is
   lifted above our complex and lowly and earthward sinking composition.

   IV.  Therefore we must begin again thus.  It is difficult to conceive
   God but to define Him in words is an impossibility, as one of the Greek
   teachers of Divinity [3433] taught, not unskilfully, as it appears to
   me; with the intention that he might be thought to have apprehended
   Him; in that he says it is a hard thing to do; and yet may escape being
   convicted of ignorance because of the impossibility of giving
   expression to the apprehension.  But in my opinion it is impossible to
   express Him, and yet more impossible to conceive Him.  For that which
   may be conceived may perhaps be made clear by language, if not fairly
   well, at any rate imperfectly, to any one who is not quite deprived of
   his hearing, or slothful of understanding.  But to comprehend the whole
   of so great a Subject as this is quite impossible and impracticable,
   not merely to the utterly careless and ignorant, but even to those who
   are highly exalted, and who love God, and in like manner to every
   created nature; seeing that the darkness of this world and the thick
   covering of the flesh is an obstacle to the full understanding of the
   truth.  I do not know whether it is the same with the higher natures
   and purer Intelligences [3434] which because of their nearness to God,
   and because they are illumined with all His Light, may possibly see, if
   not the whole, at any rate more perfectly and distinctly than we do;
   some perhaps more, some less than others, in proportion to their rank.

   V.  But enough has been said on this point.  As to what concerns us, it
   is not only the Peace of God [3435] which passeth all understanding and
   knowledge, nor only the things which God hath stored up in promise for
   the righteous, which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor mind
   conceived" [3436] except in a very small degree, nor the accurate
   knowledge of the Creation.  For even of this I would have you know that
   you have only a shadow when you hear the words, "I will consider the
   heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars," [3437] and
   the settled order therein; not as if he were considering them now, but
   as destined to do so hereafter.  But far before them is That nature
   Which is above them, and out of which they spring, the Incomprehensible
   and Illimitable--not, I mean, as to the fact of His being, but as to
   Its nature.  For our preaching is not empty, nor our Faith vain, [3438]
   nor is this the doctrine we proclaim; for we would not have you take
   our candid statement as a starting point for a quibbling denial of God,
   or of arrogance on account of our confession of ignorance.  For it is
   one thing to be persuaded of the existence of a thing, and quite
   another to know what it is.

   VI.  Now our very eyes and the Law of Nature teach us that God exists
   and that He is the Efficient and Maintaining Cause of all things:  our
   eyes, because they fall on visible objects, and see them in beautiful
   stability and progress, immovably moving and revolving if I may so say;
   natural Law, because through these visible things and their order, it
   reasons back to their Author.  For how could this Universe have come
   into being or been put together, unless God had called it into
   existence, and held it together?  For every one who sees a beautifully
   made lute, and considers the skill with which it has been fitted
   together and arranged, or who hears its melody, would think of none but
   the lutemaker, or the luteplayer, and would recur to him in mind,
   though he might not know him by sight.  And thus to us also is
   manifested That which made and moves and preserves all created things,
   even though He be not comprehended by the mind.  And very wanting in
   sense is he who will not willingly go thus far in following natural
   proofs; but not even this which we have fancied or formed, or which
   reason has sketched for us, proves the existence of a God.  But if any
   one has got even to some extent a comprehension of this, how is God's
   Being to be demonstrated?  Who ever reached this extremity of wisdom?
   Who was ever deemed worthy of so great a gift?  Who has opened the
   mouth of his mind and drawn in the Spirit, [3439] so as by Him that
   searcheth all things, yea the deep thing of God, [3440] to take in God,
   and no longer to need progress, since he already possesses the Extreme
   Object of desire, and That to which all the social life and all the
   intelligence of the best men press forward?

   VII.  For what will you conceive the Deity to be, if you rely upon all
   the approximations of reason?  Or to what will reason carry you, O most
   philosophic of men and best of Theologians, who boast of your
   familiarity with the Unlimited?  Is He a body?  How then is He the
   Infinite and Limitless, and formless, and intangible, and invisible? or
   are these attributes of a body?  What arrogance for such is not the
   nature of a body!  Or will you say that He has a body, but not these
   attributes?  O stupidity, that a Deity should possess nothing more than
   we do.  For how is He an object of worship if He be circumscribed?  Or
   how shall He escape being made of elements, and therefore subject to be
   resolved into them again, or even altogether dissolved?  For every
   compound is a starting point of strife, and strife of separation, and
   separation of dissolution.  But dissolution is altogether foreign to
   God and to the First Nature.  Therefore there can be no separation,
   that there may be no dissolution, and no strife that there may be no
   separation, and no composition that there may be no strife.  Thus also
   there must be no body, that there may be no composition, and so the
   argument is established by going back from last to first.

   VIII.  And how shall we preserve the truth that God pervades all things
   and fills all, as it is written "Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith
   the Lord," [3441] and "The Spirit of the Lord filleth the world,"
   [3442] if God partly contains and partly is contained?  For either He
   will occupy an empty Universe, and so all things will have vanished for
   us, with this result, that we shall have insulted God by making Him a
   body, and by robbing Him of all things which He has made; or else He
   will be a body contained in other bodies, which is impossible; or He
   will be enfolded in them, or contrasted with them, as liquids are
   mixed, and one divides and is divided by another;--a view which is more
   absurd and anile than even the atoms of Epicurus [3443] and so this
   argument concerning the body will fall through, and have no body and no
   solid basis at all.  But if we are to assert that He is immaterial (as
   for example that Fifth Element which some [3444] have imagined), and
   that He is carried round in the circular movement...let us assume that
   He is immaterial, and that He is the Fifth Element; and, if they
   please, let Him be also bodiless in accordance with the independent
   drift and arrangement of their argument; for I will not at present
   differ with them on this point; in what respect then will He be one of
   those things which are in movement and agitation, to say nothing of the
   insult involved in making the Creator subject to the same movement as
   the creatures, and Him That carries all (if they will allow even this)
   one with those whom He carries.  Again, what is the force that moves
   your Fifth Element, and what is it that moves all things, and what
   moves that, and what is the force that moves that?  And so on ad
   infinitum.  And how can He help being altogether contained in space if
   He be subject to motion?  But if they assert that He is something other
   than this Fifth Element; suppose it is an angelic nature that they
   attribute to Him, how will they shew that Angels are corporeal, or what
   sort of bodies they have?  And how far in that case could God, to Whom
   the Angels minister, be superior to the Angels?  And if He is above
   them, there is again brought in an irrational swarm of bodies, and a
   depth of nonsense, that has no possible basis to stand upon.

   IX.  And thus we see that God is not a body.  For no inspired teacher
   has yet asserted or admitted such a notion, nor has the sentence of our
   own Court allowed it.  Nothing then remains but to conceive of Him as
   incorporeal.  But this term Incorporeal, though granted, does not yet
   set before us--or contain within itself His Essence, any more than
   Unbegotten, or Unoriginate, or Unchanging, or Incorruptible, or any
   other predicate which is used concerning God or in reference to Him.
   For what effect is produced upon His Being or Substance [3445] by His
   having no beginning, and being incapable of change or limitation?  Nay,
   the whole question of His Being is still left for the further
   consideration and exposition of him who truly has the mind of God and
   is advanced in contemplation.  For just as to say "It is a body," or
   "It was begotten," is not sufficient to present clearly to the mind the
   various objects of which these predicates are used, but you must also
   express the subject of which you use them, if you would present the
   object of your thought clearly and adequately (for every one of these
   predicates, corporeal, begotten, mortal, may be used of a man, or a
   cow, or a horse).  Just so he who is eagerly pursuing the nature of the
   Self-existent will not stop at saying what He is not, but must go on
   beyond what He is not, and say what He is; inasmuch as it is easier to
   take in some single point than to go on disowning point after point in
   endless detail, in order, both by the elimination of negatives and the
   assertion of positives to arrive at a comprehension of this subject.

   But a man who states what God is not without going on to say what He
   is, acts much in the same way as one would who when asked how many
   twice five make, should answer, "Not two, nor three, nor four, nor
   five, nor twenty, nor thirty, nor in short any number below ten, nor
   any multiple of ten;" but would not answer "ten," nor settle the mind
   of his questioner upon the firm ground of the answer.  For it is much
   easier, and more concise to shew what a thing is not from what it is,
   than to demonstrate what it is by stripping it of what it is not.  And
   this surely is evident to every one.

   X.  Now since we have ascertained that God is incorporeal, let us
   proceed a little further with our examination.  Is He Nowhere or
   Somewhere.  For if He is Nowhere, [3446] then some person of a very
   inquiring turn of mind might ask, How is it then that He can even
   exist?  For if the non-existent is nowhere, then that which is nowhere
   is also perhaps non-existent.  But if He is Somewhere, He must be
   either in the Universe, or above the Universe.  And if He is in the
   Universe, then He must be either in some part or in the whole.  If in
   some part, then He will be circumscribed by that part which is less
   than Himself; but if everywhere, then by one which is further and
   greater--I mean the Universal, which contains the Particular; if the
   Universe is to be contained by the Universe, and no place is to be free
   from circumscription.  This follows if He is contained in the
   Universe.  And besides, where was He before the Universe was created,
   for this is a point of no little difficulty.  But if He is above the
   Universe, is there nothing to distinguish this from the Universe, and
   where is this above situated?  And how could this Transcendence and
   that which is transcended be distinguished in thought, if there is not
   a limit to divide and define them?  Is it not necessary that there
   shall be some mean to mark off the Universe from that which is above
   the Universe?  And what could this be but Place, which we have already
   rejected?  For I have not yet brought forward the point that God would
   be altogether circumscript, if He were even comprehensible in thought:
   for comprehension is one form of circumscription.

   XI.  Now, why have I gone into all this, perhaps too minutely for most
   people to listen to, and in accordance with the present manner of
   discourse, which despises noble simplicity, and has introduced a
   crooked and intricate [3447] style?  That the tree may be known by its
   fruits; [3448] I mean, that the darkness which is at work in such
   teaching may be known by the obscurity of the arguments.  For my
   purpose in doing so was, not to get credit for myself for astonishing
   utterances, or excessive wisdom, through tying knots and solving
   difficulties (this was the great miraculous gift of Daniel), [3449] but
   to make clear the point at which my argument has aimed from the first.
   And what was this?  That the Divine Nature cannot be apprehended by
   human reason, and that we cannot even represent to ourselves all its
   greatness.  And this not out of envy, for envy is far from the Divine
   Nature, which is passionless, and only good and Lord of all; [3450]
   especially envy of that which is the most honourable [3451] of all His
   creatures.  For what does the Word prefer to the rational and speaking
   creatures?  Why, even their very existence is a proof of His supreme
   goodness.  Nor yet is this incomprehensibility for the sake of His own
   glory and honour, Who is full, [3452] as if His possession of His glory
   and majesty depended upon the impossibility of approaching Him.  For it
   is utterly sophistical and foreign to the character, I will not say of
   God, but of any moderately good man, who has any right ideas about
   himself, to seek his own supremacy by throwing a hindrance in the way
   of another.

   XII.  But whether there be other causes for it also, let them see who
   are nearer God, and are eye witnesses and spectators of His
   unsearchable judgments; [3453] if there are any who are so eminent in
   virtue, and who walk in the paths of the Infinite, as the saying is.
   As far, however, as we have attained, who measure with our little
   measure things hard to be understood, perhaps one reason is to prevent
   us from too readily throwing away the possession because it was so
   easily come by.  For people cling tightly to that which they acquire
   with labour; but that which they acquire easily they quickly throw
   away, because it can be easily recovered.  And so it is turned into a
   blessing, at least to all men who are sensible, that this blessing is
   not too easy.  Or perhaps it is in order that we may not share the fate
   of Lucifer, who fell, and in consequence of receiving the full light
   make our necks stiff against the Lord Almighty, and suffer a fall, of
   all things most pitiable, from the height we had attained.  Or perhaps
   it may be to give a greater reward hereafter for their labour and
   glorious life to those who have here been purified, and have exercised
   long patience in respect of that which they desired.

   Therefore this darkness of the body has been placed between us and God,
   like the cloud of old between the Egyptians and the Hebrews; [3454] and
   this is perhaps what is meant by "He made darkness His secret place,"
   [3455] namely our dulness, through which few can see even a little.
   But as to this point, let those discuss it whose business it is; and
   let them ascend as far as possible in the examination.  To us who are
   (as Jeremiah saith), "prisoners of the earth," [3456] and covered with
   the denseness of carnal nature, this at all events is known, that as it
   is impossible for a man to step over his own shadow, however fast he
   may move (for the shadow will always move on as fast as it is being
   overtaken) or, as it is impossible for the eye to draw near to visible
   objects apart from the intervening air and light, or for a fish to
   glide about outside of the waters; so it is quite impracticable for
   those who are in the body to be conversant with objects of pure thought
   apart altogether from bodily objects.  For something in our own
   environment is ever creeping in, even when the mind has most fully
   detached itself from the visible, and collected itself, and is
   attempting to apply itself to those invisible things which are akin to
   itself.

   XIII.  This will be made clear to you as follows:--Are not Spirit, and
   Fire, and Light, Love, and Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Mind and
   Reason, and the like, the names of the First Nature?  What then?  Can
   you conceive of Spirit apart from motion and diffusion; or of Fire
   without its fuel and its upward motion, and its proper colour and
   form?  Or of Light unmingled with air, and loosed from that which is as
   it were its father and source?  And how do you conceive of a mind?  Is
   it not that which is inherent in some person not itself, and are not
   its movements thoughts, silent or uttered?  And Reason...what else can
   you think it than that which is either silent within ourselves, or else
   outpoured (for I shrink from saying loosed)?  And if you conceive of
   Wisdom, what is it but the habit of mind which you know as such, and
   which is concerned with contemplations either divine or human?  And
   Justice and Love, are they not praiseworthy dispositions, the one
   opposed to injustice, the other to hate, and at one time intensifying
   themselves, at another relaxed, now taking possession of us, now
   leaving us alone, and in a word, making us what we are, and changing us
   as colours do bodies?  Or are we rather to leave all these things, and
   to look at the Deity absolutely, as best we can, collecting a
   fragmentary perception of It from Its images?  What then is this
   subtile thing, which is of these, and yet is not these, or how can that
   Unity which is in its Nature uncomposite and incomparable, still be all
   of these, and each one of them perfectly?  Thus our mind faints to
   transcend corporeal things, and to consort with the Incorporeal,
   stripped of all clothing of corporeal ideas, as long as it has to look
   with its inherent weakness at things above its strength.  For every
   rational nature longs for God and for the First Cause, but is unable to
   grasp Him, for the reasons I have mentioned.  Faint therefore with the
   desire, and as it were restive and impatient of the disability, it
   tries a second course, either to look at visible things, and out of
   some of them to make a god...(a poor contrivance, for in what respect
   and to what extent can that which is seen be higher and more godlike
   than that which sees, that this should worship that?) or else through
   the beauty and order of visible things to attain to that which is above
   sight; but not to suffer the loss of God through the magnificence of
   visible things.

   XIV.  From this cause some have made a god of the Sun, others of the
   Moon, others of the host of Stars, others of heaven itself with all its
   hosts, to which they have attributed the guiding of the Universe,
   according to the quality or quantity of their movement.  Others again
   of the Elements, earth, air, water, fire, because of their useful
   nature, since without them human life cannot possibly exist.  Others
   again have worshipped any chance visible objects, setting up the most
   beautiful of what they saw as their gods.  And there are those who
   worship pictures and images, at first indeed of their own ancestors--at
   least, this is the case with the more affectionate and sensual--and
   honour the departed with memorials; and afterwards even those of
   strangers are worshipped by men of a later generation separated from
   them by a long interval; through ignorance of the First Nature, and
   following the traditional honour as lawful and necessary; for usage
   when confirmed by time was held to be Law.  And I think that some who
   were courtiers of arbitrary power and extolled bodily strength and
   admired beauty, made a god in time out of him whom they honoured,
   perhaps getting hold of some fable to help on their imposture.

   XV.  And those of them who were most subject to passion deified their
   passions, or honoured them among their gods; Anger and
   Blood-thirstiness, Lust and Drunkenness, and every similar wickedness;
   and made out of this an ignoble and unjust excuse for their own sins.
   And some they left on earth, and some they hid beneath the earth (this
   being the only sign of wisdom about them), and some they raised to
   heaven. [3457]   O ridiculous distribution of inheritance!  Then they
   gave to each of these concepts the name of some god or demon, by the
   authority and private judgment of their error, and set up statues whose
   costliness is a snare, and thought to honour them with blood and the
   steam of sacrifices, and sometimes even by most shameful actions,
   frenzies and manslaughter.  For such honours were the fitting due of
   such gods.  And before now men have insulted themselves by worshipping
   monsters, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things, [3458] and of the
   very vilest and most absurd, and have made an offering to them of the
   glory of God; so that it is not easy to decide whether we ought most to
   despise the worshippers or the objects of their worship.  Probably the
   worshippers are far the most contemptible, for though they are of a
   rational nature, and have received grace from God, they have set up the
   worse as the better.  And this was the trick of the Evil One, who
   abused good to an evil purpose, as in most of his evil deeds.  For he
   laid hold of their desire in its wandering in search of God, in order
   to distort to himself [3459] the power, and steal the desire, leading
   it by the hand, like a blind man asking a road; and he hurled down and
   scattered some in one direction and some in another, into one pit of
   death and destruction.

   XVI.  This was their course.  But reason receiving us in our desire for
   God, and in our sense of the impossibility of being without a leader
   and guide, and then making us apply ourselves to things visible and
   meeting with the things which have been since the beginning, doth not
   stay its course even here.  For it was not the part of Wisdom to grant
   the sovereignty to things which are, as observation tells us, of equal
   rank.  By these then it leads to that which is above these, and by
   which being is given to these.  For what is it which ordered things in
   heaven and things in earth, and those which pass through air, and those
   which live in water; or rather the things which were before these,
   heaven and earth, air and water?  Who mingled these, and who
   distributed them?  What is it that each has in common with the other,
   and their mutual dependence and agreement?  For I commend the man,
   though he was a heathen, who said, What gave movement to these, and
   drives their ceaseless and unhindered motion?  Is it not the Artificer
   of them Who implanted reason in them all, in accordance with which the
   Universe is moved and controlled?  Is it not He who made them and
   brought them into being?  For we cannot attribute such a power to the
   Accidental.  For, suppose that its existence is accidental, to what
   will you let us ascribe its order?  And if you like we will grant you
   this:  to what then will you ascribe its preservation and protection in
   accordance with the terms of its first creation.  Do these belong to
   the Accidental, or to something else?  Surely not to the Accidental.
   And what can this Something Else be but God?  Thus reason that proceeds
   from God, that is implanted in all from the beginning and is the first
   law in us, and is bound up in all, leads us up to God through visible
   things.  Let us begin again, and reason this out.

   XVII.  What God is in nature and essence, no man ever yet has
   discovered or can discover.  Whether it will ever be discovered is a
   question which he who will may examine and decide.  In my opinion it
   will be discovered when that within us which is godlike and divine, I
   mean our mind and reason, shall have mingled with its Like, and the
   image shall have ascended to the Archetype, of which it has now the
   desire.  And this I think is the solution of that vexed problem as to
   "We shall know even as we are known." [3460]   But in our present life
   all that comes to us is but a little effluence, and as it were a small
   effulgence from a great Light.  So that if anyone has known God, or has
   had the testimony of Scripture to his knowledge of God, we are to
   understand such an one to have possessed a degree of knowledge which
   gave him the appearance of being more fully enlightened than another
   who did not enjoy the same degree of illumination; and this relative
   superiority is spoken of as if it were absolute knowledge, not because
   it is really such, but by comparison with the power of that other.

   XVIII.  Thus Enos "hoped to call upon the Name of the Lord." [3461]
   Hope was that for which he is commended; and that, not that he should
   know God, but that he should call upon him.  And Enoch was translated,
   [3462] but it is not yet clear whether it was because he already
   comprehended the Divine Nature, or in order that he might comprehend
   it.  And Noah's [3463] glory was that he was pleasing to God; he who
   was entrusted with the saving of the whole world from the waters, or
   rather of the Seeds of the world, escaped the Deluge in a small Ark.
   And Abraham, great Patriarch though he was, was justified by faith,
   [3464] and offered a strange victim, [3465] the type of the Great
   Sacrifice.  Yet he saw not God as God, but gave Him food as a man.
   [3466]   He was approved because he worshipped as far as he
   comprehended. [3467]   And Jacob dreamed of a lofty ladder and stair of
   Angels, and in a mystery anointed a pillar [3468] --perhaps to signify
   the Rock that was anointed for our sake--and gave to a place the name
   of The House of God [3469] in honour of Him whom he saw; and wrestled
   with God in human form; whatever this wrestling of God with man may
   mean...possibly it refers to the comparison of man's virtue with God's;
   and he bore on his body the marks of the wrestling, setting forth the
   defeat of the created nature; and for a reward of his reverence he
   received a change of his name; being named, instead of Jacob,
   Israel--that great and honourable name.  Yet neither he nor any one on
   his behalf, unto this day, of all the Twelve Tribes who were his
   children, could boast that he comprehended the whole nature or the pure
   sight of God.

   XIX.  To Elias neither the strong wind, nor the fire, nor the
   earthquake, as you learn from the story, [3470] but a light breeze
   adumbrated the Presence of God, and not even this His Nature.  And who
   was this Elias?  The man whom a chariot of fire took up to heaven,
   signifying the superhuman excellency of the righteous man.  And are you
   not amazed at Manoah the Judge of yore, and at Peter the disciple in
   later days; the one being unable to endure the sight even of one in
   whom was a representation of God; and saying, "We are undone, O wife,
   we have seen God;" [3471] speaking as though even a vision of God could
   not be grasped by human beings, let alone the Nature of God; and the
   other unable to endure the Presence of Christ in his boat and therefore
   bidding Him depart; [3472] and this though Peter was more zealous than
   the others for the knowledge of Christ, and received a blessing for
   this, [3473] and was entrusted with the greatest gifts.  What would you
   say of Isaiah or Ezekiel, who was an eyewitness of very great
   mysteries, and of the other Prophets; for one of these saw the Lord of
   Sabaoth sitting on the Throne of glory, [3474] and encircled and
   praised and hidden by the sixwinged Seraphim, and was himself purged by
   the live coal, and equipped for his prophetic office.  And the other
   describes the Cherubic Chariot [3475] of God, and the Throne upon them,
   and the Firmament over it, and Him that shewed Himself in the
   Firmament, and Voices, and Forces, and Deeds. [3476]   And whether this
   was an appearance by day, only visible to Saints, or an unerring vision
   of the night, or an impression on the mind holding converse with the
   future as if it were the present; or some other ineffable form of
   prophecy, I cannot say; the God of the Prophets knoweth, and they know
   who are thus inspired.  But neither these of whom I am speaking, nor
   any of their fellows ever stood before the Council [3477] and Essence
   of God, as it is written, or saw, or proclaimed the Nature of God.

   XX.  If it had been permitted to Paul to utter what the Third Heaven
   [3478] contained, and his own advance, or ascension, or assumption
   thither, perhaps we should know something more about God's Nature, if
   this was the mystery of the rapture.  But since it was ineffable, we
   too will honour it by silence.  Thus much we will hear Paul say about
   it, that we know in part and we prophesy in part. [3479]   This and the
   like to this are the confessions of one who is not rude in knowledge,
   [3480] who threatens to give proof of Christ speaking in him, the great
   doctor and champion of the truth.  Wherefore he estimates all knowledge
   on earth only as through a glass darkly, [3481] as taking its stand
   upon little images of the truth.  Now, unless I appear to anyone too
   careful, and over anxious about the examination of this matter, perhaps
   it was of this and nothing else that the Word Himself intimated that
   there were things which could not now be borne, but which should be
   borne and cleared up hereafter, [3482] and which John the Forerunner of
   the Word and great Voice of the Truth declared even the whole world
   could not contain. [3483]

   XXI.  The truth then, and the whole Word is full of difficulty and
   obscurity; and as it were with a small instrument we are undertaking a
   great work, when with merely human wisdom we pursue the knowledge of
   the Self-existent, and in company with, or not apart from, the senses,
   by which we are borne hither and thither, and led into error, we apply
   ourselves to the search after things which are only to be grasped by
   the mind, and we are unable by meeting bare realities with bare
   intellect to approximate somewhat more closely to the truth, and to
   mould the mind by its concepts.

   Now the subject of God is more hard to come at, [3484] in proportion as
   it is more perfect than any other, and is open to more objections, and
   the solutions of them are more laborious.  For every objection, however
   small, stops and hinders the course of our argument, and cuts off its
   further advance, just like men who suddenly check with the rein the
   horses in full career, and turn them right round by the unexpected
   shock.  Thus Solomon, who was the wisest of all men, [3485] whether
   before him or in his own time, to whom God gave breadth of heart, and a
   flood of contemplation, more abundant than the sand, even he, the more
   he entered into the depth, the more dizzy he became, and declared the
   furthest point of wisdom to be the discovery of how very far off she
   was from him. [3486]   Paul also tries to arrive at, I will not say the
   nature of God, for this he knew was utterly impossible, but only the
   judgments of God; and since he finds no way out, and no halting place
   in the ascent, and moreover, since the earnest searching of his mind
   after knowledge does not end in any definite conclusion, because some
   fresh unattained point is being continually disclosed to him (O marvel,
   that I have a like experience), he closes his discourse with
   astonishment, and calls this the riches of God, [3487] and the depth,
   and confesses the unsearchableness of the judgments of God, in almost
   the very words of David, who at one time calls God's judgments the
   great deep whose foundations cannot be reached by measure or sense;
   [3488] and at another says that His knowledge of him and of his own
   constitution was marvellous, [3489] and had attained greater strength
   than was in his own power or grasp.

   XXII.  For if, he says, I leave everything else alone, and consider
   myself and the whole nature and constitution of man, and how we are
   mingled, and what is our movement, and how the mortal was compounded
   with the immortal, and how it is that I flow downwards, and yet am
   borne upwards, and how the soul is circumscribed; [3490] and how it
   gives life and shares in feelings; and how the mind is at once
   circumscribed and unlimited, [3491] abiding in us and yet travelling
   over the Universe in swift motion and flow; how it is both received and
   imparted by word, and passes through air, and enters with all things;
   how it shares in sense, and enshrouds itself away from sense.  And even
   before these questions--what was our first moulding and composition in
   the workshop of nature, and what is our last formation and completion?
   What is the desire for and imparting of nourishment, and who brought us
   spontaneously to those first springs and sources of life?  How is the
   body nourished by food, and the soul by reason?  What is the drawing of
   nature, and the mutual relation between parents and children, that it
   should be held together by a spell of love?  How is it that species are
   permanent, and are different in their characteristics, although there
   are so many that their individual marks cannot be described?  How is it
   that the same animal is both mortal and immortal [3492] , the one by
   decease, the other by coming into being?  For one departs, and another
   takes its place, just like the flow of a river, which is never still,
   yet ever constant.  And you might discuss many more points concerning
   men's members and parts, and their mutual adaptation both for use and
   beauty, and how some are connected and others disjoined, some are more
   excellent and others less comely, some are united and others divided,
   some contain and others are contained, according to the law and reason
   of Nature.  Much too might be said about voices and ears.  How is it
   that the voice is carried by the vocal organs, and received by the
   ears, and both are joined by the smiting and resounding of the medium
   of the air?  Much too of the eyes, which have an indescribable
   communion with visible objects, and which are moved by the will alone,
   and that together, and are affected exactly as is the mind.  For with
   equal speed the mind is joined to the objects of thought, the eye to
   those of sight.  Much too concerning the other senses, not objects of
   the research of reason.  And much concerning our rest in sleep, and the
   figments of dreams, and of memory and remembrance; of calculation, and
   anger, and desire; and in a word, all by which this little world called
   Man is swayed.

   XXIII.  Shall I reckon up for you the differences of the other animals,
   both from us and from each other,--differences of nature, and of
   production, and of nourishment, and of region, and of temper, and as it
   were of social life?  How is it that some are gregarious and others
   solitary, some herbivorous and others carnivorous, some fierce and
   others tame, some fond of man and domesticated, others untamable and
   free?  And some we might call bordering on reason and power of
   learning, while others are altogether destitute of reason, and
   incapable of being taught.  Some with fuller senses, others with less;
   some immovable, and some with the power of walking, and some very
   swift, and some very slow; some surpassing in size or beauty, or in one
   or other of these respects; others very small or very ugly, or both;
   some strong, others weak, some apt at self-defence, others timid and
   crafty [3493] and others again are unguarded.  Some are laborious and
   thrifty, others altogether idle and improvident.  And before we come to
   such points as these, how is it that some are crawling things, and
   others upright; some attached to one spot, some amphibious; some
   delight in beauty and others are unadorned; some are married and some
   single; some temperate and others intemperate; some have numerous
   offspring and others not; some are long-lived and others have but short
   lives?  It would be a weary discourse to go through all the details.

   XXIV.  Look also at the fishy tribe gliding through the waters, and as
   it were flying through the liquid element, and breathing its own air,
   but in danger when in contact with ours, as we are in the waters; and
   mark their habits and dispositions, their intercourse and their births,
   their size and their beauty, and their affection for places, and their
   wanderings, and their assemblings and departings, and their properties
   which so nearly resemble those of the animals that dwell on land; in
   some cases community, in others contrast of properties, both in name
   and shape.  And consider the tribes of birds, and their varieties of
   form and colour, both of those which are voiceless and of songbirds.
   What is the reason of their melody, and from whom came it?  Who gave to
   the grasshopper the lute in his breast, and the songs and chirruping on
   the branches, when they are moved by the sun to make their midday
   music, and sing among the groves, and escort the wayfarer with their
   voices?  Who wove the song for the swan when he spreads his wings to
   the breezes, and makes melody of their rustling?  For I will not speak
   of the forced voices, and all the rest that art contrives against the
   truth.  Whence does the peacock, that boastful bird of Media, get his
   love of beauty and of praise (for he is fully conscious of his own
   beauty), so that when he sees any one approaching, or when, as they
   say, he would make a show before his hens, raising his neck and
   spreading his tail in circle around him, glittering like gold and
   studded with stars, he makes a spectacle of his beauty to his lovers
   with pompous strides?  Now Holy Scripture admires the cleverness in
   weaving even of women, saying, Who gave to woman skill in weaving and
   cleverness in the art of embroidery? [3494]   This belongeth to a
   living creature that hath reason, and exceedeth in wisdom and maketh
   way even as far as the things of heaven.

   XXV.  But I would have you marvel at the natural knowledge even of
   irrational creatures, and if you can, explain its cause.  How is it
   that birds have for nests rocks and trees and roofs, and adapt them
   both for safety and beauty, and suitably for the comfort of their
   nurslings?  Whence do bees and spiders get their love of work and art,
   by which the former plan their honeycombs, and join them together by
   hexagonal and co-ordinate tubes, and construct the foundation by means
   of a partition and an alternation of the angles with straight lines;
   and this, as is the case, in such dusky hives and dark combs; and the
   latter weave their intricate webs by such light and almost airy threads
   stretched in divers ways, and this from almost invisible beginnings, to
   be at once a precious dwelling, and a trap for weaker creatures with a
   view to enjoyment of food?  What Euclid ever imitated these, while
   pursuing philosophical enquiries with lines that have no real
   existence, and wearying himself with demonstrations?  From what
   Palamedes came the tactics, and, as the saying is, the movements and
   configurations of cranes, and the systems of their movement in ranks
   and their complicated flight?  Who were their Phidiæ and Zeuxides, and
   who were the Parrhasii and Aglaophons who knew how to draw and mould
   excessively beautiful things?  What harmonious Gnossian chorus of
   Dædalus, wrought for a girl [3495] to the highest pitch of beauty?
   What Cretan Labyrinth, hard to get through, hard to unravel, as the
   poets say, and continually crossing itself through the tricks of its
   construction?  I will not speak of the ants' storehouses and
   storekeepers, and of their treasurings of wood in quantities
   corresponding to the time for which it is wanted, and all the other
   details which we know are told of their marches and leaders and their
   good order in their works.

   XXVI.  If this knowledge has come within your reach and you are
   familiar with these branches of science, look at the differences of
   plants also, up to the artistic fashion of the leaves, which is adapted
   both to give the utmost pleasure to the eye, and to be of the greatest
   advantage to the fruit.  Look too at the variety and lavish abundance
   of fruits, and most of all at the wondrous beauty of such as are most
   necessary.  And consider the power of roots, and juices, and flowers,
   and odours, not only so very sweet, but also serviceable as medicines;
   and the graces and qualities of colours; and again the costly value,
   and the brilliant transparency of precious stones.  Since nature has
   set before you all things as in an abundant banquet free to all, both
   the necessaries and the luxuries of life, in order that, if nothing
   else, you may at any rate know God by His benefits, and by your own
   sense of want be made wiser than you were.  Next, I pray you, traverse
   the length and breadth of earth, the common mother of all, and the
   gulfs of the sea bound together with one another and with the land, and
   the beautiful forests, and the rivers and springs abundant and
   perennial, not only of waters cold and fit for drinking, and on the
   surface of the earth; but also such as running beneath the earth, and
   flowing under caverns, are then forced out by a violent blast, and
   repelled, and then filled with heat by this violence of strife and
   repulsion, burst out by little and little wherever they get a chance,
   and hence supply our need of hot baths in many parts of the earth, and
   in conjunction with the cold give us a healing which is without cost
   and spontaneous.  Tell me how and whence are these things?  What is
   this great web unwrought by art?  These things are no less worthy of
   admiration, in respect of their mutual relations than when considered
   separately.

   How is it that the earth stands solid and unswerving?  On what is it
   supported?  What is it that props it up, and on what does that rest?
   For indeed even reason has nothing to lean upon, but only the Will of
   God.  And how is it that part of it is drawn up into mountain summits,
   and part laid down in plains, and this in various and differing ways?
   And because the variations are individually small, it both supplies our
   needs more liberally, and is more beautiful by its variety; part being
   distributed into habitations, and part left uninhabited, namely all the
   great height of Mountains, and the various clefts of its coast line cut
   off from it.  Is not this the clearest proof of the majestic working of
   God?

   XXVII.  And with respect to the Sea even if I did not marvel at its
   greatness, yet I should have marvelled at its gentleness, in that
   although loose it stands within its boundaries; and if not at its
   gentleness, yet surely at its greatness; but since I marvel at both, I
   will praise the Power that is in both.  What collected it?  What
   bounded it?  How is it raised and lulled to rest, as though respecting
   its neighbour earth?  How, moreover, does it receive all the rivers,
   and yet remain the same, through the very superabundance of its
   immensity, if that term be permissible?  How is the boundary of it,
   though it be an element of such magnitude, only sand?  Have your
   natural philosophers with their knowledge of useless details anything
   to tell us, those men I mean who are really endeavouring to measure the
   sea with a wineglass, and such mighty works by their own conceptions?
   Or shall I give the really scientific explanation of it from Scripture
   concisely, and yet more satisfactorily and truly than by the longest
   arguments?  "He hath fenced the face of the water with His command."
   [3496]   This is the chain of fluid nature.  And how doth He bring upon
   it the Nautilus that inhabits the dry land (i.e., man) in a little
   vessel, and with a little breeze (dost thou not marvel at the sight of
   this,--is not thy mind astonished?), that earth and sea may be bound
   together by needs and commerce, and that things so widely separated by
   nature should be thus brought together into one for man?  What are the
   first fountains of springs?  Seek, O man, if you can trace out or find
   any of these things.  And who was it who cleft the plains and the
   mountains for the rivers, and gave them an unhindered course?  And how
   comes the marvel on the other side, that the Sea never overflows, nor
   the Rivers cease to flow?  And what is the nourishing power of water,
   and what the difference therein; for some things are irrigated from
   above, and others drink from their roots, if I may luxuriate a little
   in my language when speaking of the luxuriant gifts of God.

   XXVIII.  And now, leaving the earth and the things of earth, soar into
   the air on the wings of thought, that our argument may advance in due
   path; and thence I will take you up to heavenly things, and to heaven
   itself, and things which are above heaven; for to that which is beyond
   my discourse hesitates to ascend, but still it shall ascend as far as
   may be.  Who poured forth the air, that great and abundant wealth, not
   measured to men by their rank or fortunes; not restrained by
   boundaries; not divided out according to people's ages; but like the
   distribution of the Manna, [3497] received in sufficiency, and valued
   for its equality of distribution; the chariot of the winged creation;
   the seat of the winds; the moderator of the seasons; the quickener of
   living things, or rather the preserver of natural life in the body; in
   which bodies have their being, and by which we speak; in which is the
   light and all that it shines upon, and the sight which flows through
   it?  And mark, if you please, what follows.  I cannot give to the air
   the whole empire of all that is thought to belong to the air.  What are
   the storehouses of the winds? [3498]   What are the treasuries of the
   snow?  Who, as Scripture hath said, hath begotten the drops of dew?
   Out of Whose womb came the ice? and Who bindeth the waters in the
   clouds, and, fixing part in the clouds (O marvel!) held by His Word
   though its nature is to flow, poureth out the rest upon the face of the
   whole earth, and scattereth it abroad in due season, and in just
   proportions, and neither suffereth the whole substance of moisture to
   go out free and uncontrolled (for sufficient was the cleansing in the
   days of Noah; and He who cannot lie is not forgetful of His own
   covenant);...nor yet restraineth it entirely that we should not again
   stand in need of an Elias [3499] to bring the drought to an end.  If He
   shall shut up heaven, it saith, who shall open it?  If He open the
   floodgates, who shall shut them up? [3500]   Who can bring an excess or
   withhold a sufficiency of rain, unless he govern the Universe by his
   own measures and balances?  What scientific laws, pray, can you lay
   down concerning thunder and lightning, O you who thunder from the
   earth, and cannot shine with even little sparks of truth?  To what
   vapours from earth will you attribute the creation of cloud, or is it
   due to some thickening of the air, or pressure or crash of clouds of
   excessive rarity, so as to make you think the pressure the cause of the
   lightning, and the crash that which makes the thunder?  Or what
   compression of wind having no outlet will account to you for the
   lightning by its compression, and for the thunder by its bursting out?

   Now if you have in your thought passed through the air and all the
   things of air, reach with me to heaven and the things of heaven.  And
   let faith lead us rather than reason, if at least you have learnt the
   feebleness of the latter in matters nearer to you, and have known
   reason by knowing the things that are beyond reason, so as not to be
   altogether on the earth or of the earth, because you are ignorant even
   of your ignorance.

   XXIX.  Who spread the sky around us, and set the stars in order?  Or
   rather, first, can you tell me, of your own knowledge of the things in
   heaven, what are the sky and the stars; you who know not what lies at
   your very feet, and cannot even take the measure of yourself, and yet
   must busy yourself about what is above your nature, and gape at the
   illimitable?  For, granted that you understand orbits and periods, and
   waxings and wanings, and settings and risings, and some degrees and
   minutes, and all the other things which make you so proud of your
   wonderful knowledge; you have not arrived at comprehension of the
   realities themselves, but only at an observation of some movement,
   which, when confirmed by longer practice, and drawing the observations
   of many individuals into one generalization, and thence deducing a law,
   has acquired the name of Science (just as the lunar phenomena have
   become generally known to our sight), being the basis of this
   knowledge.  But if you are very scientific on this subject, and have a
   just claim to admiration, tell me what is the cause of this order and
   this movement.  How came the sun to be a beacon-fire to the whole
   world, and to all eyes like the leader of some chorus, concealing all
   the rest of the stars by his brightness, more completely than some of
   them conceal others.  The proof of this is that they shine against him,
   but he outshines them and does not even allow it to be perceived that
   they rose simultaneously with him, fair as a bridegroom, swift and
   great as a giant [3501] for I will not let his praises be sung from any
   other source than my own Scriptures--so mighty in strength that from
   one end to the other of the world he embraces all things in his heat,
   and there is nothing hid from the feeling thereof, but it fills both
   every eye with light, and every embodied creature with heat; warming,
   yet not burning, by the gentleness of its temper, and the order of its
   movement, present to all, and equally embracing all.

   XXX.  Have you considered the importance of the fact that a heathen
   writer [3502] speaks of the sun as holding the same position among
   material objects as God does among objects of thought?  For the one
   gives light to the eyes, as the Other does to the mind; and is the most
   beautiful of the objects of sight, as God is of those of thought.  But
   who gave him motion at first?  And what is it which ever moves him in
   his circuit, though in his nature stable and immovable, truly
   unwearied, and the giver and sustainer of life, and all the rest of the
   titles which the poets justly sing of him, and never resting in his
   course or his benefits?  How comes he to be the creator of day when
   above the earth, and of night when below it? or whatever may be the
   right expression when one contemplates the sun?  What are the mutual
   aggressions and concessions of day and night, and their regular
   irregularities--to use a somewhat strange expression?  How comes he to
   be the maker and divider of the seasons, that come and depart in
   regular order, and as in a dance interweave with each other, or stand
   apart by a law of love on the one hand, and of order on the other, and
   mingle little by little, and steal on their neighbour, just as nights
   and days do, so as not to give us pain by their suddenness.  This will
   be enough about the sun.

   Do you know the nature and phenomena of the Moon, and the measures and
   courses of light, and how it is that the sun bears rule over the day,
   and the moon presides over the night; and while She gives confidence to
   wild beasts, He stirs Man up to work, raising or lowering himself as
   may be most serviceable?  Know you the bond of Pleiades, or the fence
   of Orion [3503] as He who counteth the number of the stars and calleth
   them all by their names? [3504]   Know you the differences of the glory
   [3505] of each, and the order of their movement, that I should trust
   you, when by them you weave the web of human concerns, and arm the
   creature against the Creator?

   XXXI.  What say you?  Shall we pause here, after discussing nothing
   further than matter and visible things, or, since the Word knows the
   Tabernacle of Moses to be a figure of the whole creation--I mean the
   entire system of things visible and invisible--shall we pass the first
   veil, and stepping beyond the realm of sense, shall we look into the
   Holy Place, the Intellectual and Celestial creation?  But not even this
   can we see in an incorporeal way, though it is incorporeal, since it is
   called--or is--Fire and Spirit.  For He is said to make His Angels
   spirits, and His Ministers a flame of fire [3506] ...though perhaps
   this "making" means preserving by that Word by which they came into
   existence.  The Angel then is called spirit and fire; Spirit, as being
   a creature of the intellectual sphere; Fire, as being of a purifying
   nature; for I know that the same names belong to the First Nature.
   But, relatively to us at least, we must reckon the Angelic Nature
   incorporeal, or at any rate as nearly so as possible.  Do you see how
   we get dizzy over this subject, and cannot advance to any point, unless
   it be as far as this, that we know there are Angels and Archangels,
   Thrones, Dominions, Princedoms, Powers, Splendours, Ascents,
   Intelligent Powers or Intelligencies, pure natures and unalloyed,
   immovable to evil, or scarcely movable; ever circling in chorus round
   the First Cause (or how should we sing their praises?) illuminated
   thence with the purest Illumination, or one in one degree and one in
   another, proportionally to their nature and rank...so conformed to
   beauty and moulded that they become secondary Lights, and can enlighten
   others by the overflowings and largesses of the First Light?
   Ministrants of God's Will, strong with both inborn and imparted
   strength, traversing all space, readily present to all at any place
   through their zeal for ministry and the agility of their
   nature...different individuals of them embracing different parts of the
   world, or appointed over different districts of the Universe, as He
   knoweth who ordered and distributed it all.  Combining all things in
   one, solely with a view to the consent of the Creator of all things;
   Hymners of the Majesty of the Godhead, eternally contemplating the
   Eternal Glory, not that God may thereby gain an increase of glory, for
   nothing can be added to that which is full--to Him, who supplies good
   to all outside Himself but that there may never be a cessation of
   blessings to these first natures after God.  If we have told these
   things as they deserve, it is by the grace of the Trinity, and of the
   one Godhead in Three Persons; but if less perfectly than we have
   desired, yet even so our discourse has gained its purpose.  For this is
   what we were labouring to shew, that even the secondary natures surpass
   the power of our intellect; much more then the First and (for I fear to
   say merely That which is above all), the only Nature.

   Bliss.  S. Thomas (Summa I. qu. xii. 4) argues that the Angels have
   cognition of God's Essence not by nature but by grace:  but yet (Ib.
   qu. lvi. 3) that they have by nature a certain cognition of Him, as
   represented and as it were mirrored in their own essence; though not
   the actual vision of His Essence.  The Angel, he says again (Ib. qu.

   existed, and He created Place, which therefore cannot be the seat of

   One.

   [3469] v. l. The Form of God, which would refer to the occasion cited
   below.  The reading is grammatically easier, as an accusative is
   required; but in that case we might have expected the wrestling with
   the Angel to have been mentioned first, as the name Penuel was given by
   Jacob on the day following the night in which he wrestled, and received
   his own change of name.  The Benedictines, while retaining House in
   text and version, express a preference for Form, because the subject of
   the argument is the Vision of God.

   [3477] This is a quotation from the LXX. of Jer. xxiii. 18, where for
   hupostemati Aquila has aporreto, and Symmachus homilia, (according to
   Trommius).  hupostema properly means a Station of troops, and such is
   the meaning in the other two places where the word occurs in the LXX.,
   viz.:--2 Sam. xxiii. 14, and 1 Chron. xi. 16.  The Hebrew word which it
   represents in this passage is one of frequent use, and means "a
   Council," or, in a sense derived from this, Familiar Intercourse.  In
   Job xv. 8 it is rendered in A.V. The Secret of God, where the LXX. has
   suntagma.  The Vulgate in both cases has Concilium Dei; the
   Benedictines however render it Substance.  A.V. has Counsel, and in
   marg. Secret; while R.V. reads Council, with no marginal alternative.

   Oration XXIX.

   The Third Theological Oration.

   On the Son.

   I.  This then is what might be said to cut short our opponents'
   readiness to argue and their hastiness with its consequent insecurity
   in all matters, but above all in those discussions which relate to
   God.  But since to rebuke others is a matter of no difficulty whatever,
   but a very easy thing, which any one who likes can do; whereas to
   substitute one's own belief for theirs is the part of a pious and
   intelligent man; let us, relying on the Holy Ghost, Who among them is
   dishonoured, but among us is adored, bring forth to the light our own
   conceptions about the Godhead, whatever these may be, like some noble
   and timely birth.  Not that I have at other times been silent; for on
   this subject alone I am full of youthful strength and daring; but the
   fact is that under present circumstances I am even more bold to declare
   the truth, that I may not (to use the words of Scripture) by drawing
   back fall into the condemnation of being displeasing to God. [3507]
   And since every discourse is of a twofold nature, the one part
   establishing one's own, and the other overthrowing one's opponents'
   position; let us first of all state our own position, and then try to
   controvert that of our opponents;--and both as briefly as possible, so
   that our arguments may be taken in at a glance (like those of the
   elementary treatises which they have devised to deceive simple or
   foolish persons), and that our thoughts may not be scattered by reason
   of the length of the discourse, like water which is not contained in a
   channel, but flows to waste over the open land.

   II.  The three most ancient opinions concerning God are Anarchia,
   Polyarchia, and Monarchia.  The first two are the sport of the children
   of Hellas, and may they continue to be so.  For Anarchy is a thing
   without order; and the Rule of Many is factious, and thus anarchical,
   and thus disorderly.  For both these tend to the same thing, namely
   disorder; and this to dissolution, for disorder is the first step to
   dissolution.

   But Monarchy is that which we hold in honour.  It is, however, a
   Monarchy that is not limited to one Person, for it is possible for
   Unity if at variance with itself to come into a condition of plurality;
   [3508] but one which is made of an equality of Nature and a Union of
   mind, and an identity of motion, and a convergence of its elements to
   unity--a thing which is impossible to the created nature--so that
   though numerically distinct there is no severance of Essence.
   Therefore Unity [3509] having from all eternity arrived by motion at
   Duality, found its rest in Trinity.  This is what we mean by Father and
   Son and Holy Ghost.  The Father is the Begetter and the Emitter; [3510]
   without passion of course, and without reference to time, and not in a
   corporeal manner.  The Son is the Begotten, and the Holy Ghost the
   Emission; for I know not how this could be expressed in terms
   altogether excluding visible things.  For we shall not venture to speak
   of "an overflow of goodness," as one of the Greek Philosophers dared to
   say, as if it were a bowl overflowing, and this in plain words in his
   Discourse on the First and Second Causes. [3511]   Let us not ever look
   on this Generation as involuntary, like some natural overflow, hard to
   be retained, and by no means befitting our conception of Deity.
   Therefore let us confine ourselves within our limits, and speak of the
   Unbegotten and the Begotten and That which proceeds from the Father, as
   somewhere God the Word Himself saith.

   III.  When did these come into being?  They are above all "When."  But,
   if I am to speak with something more of boldness,--when the Father
   did.  And when did the Father come into being.  There never was a time
   when He was not.  And the same thing is true of the Son and the Holy
   Ghost.  Ask me again, and again I will answer you, When was the Son
   begotten?  When the Father was not begotten.  And when did the Holy
   Ghost proceed?  When the Son was, not proceeding but, begotten--beyond
   the sphere of time, and above the grasp of reason; although we cannot
   set forth that which is above time, if we avoid as we desire any
   expression which conveys the idea of time.  For such expressions as
   "when" and "before" and "after" and "from the beginning" are not
   timeless, however much we may force them; unless indeed we were to take
   the Æon, that interval which is coextensive with the eternal things,
   and is not divided or measured by any motion, or by the revolution of
   the sun, as time is measured.

   How then are They not alike unoriginate, if They are coeternal?
   Because They are from Him, though not after Him.  For that which is
   unoriginate is eternal, but that which is eternal is not necessarily
   unoriginate, so long as it may be referred to the Father as its
   origin.  Therefore in respect of Cause They are not unoriginate; but it
   is evident that the Cause is not necessarily prior to its effects, for
   the sun is not prior to its light.  And yet They are in some sense
   unoriginate, in respect of time, even though you would scare simple
   minds with your quibbles, for the Sources of Time are not subject to
   time.

   IV.  But how can this generation be passionless?  In that it is
   incorporeal.  For if corporeal generation involves passion, incorporeal
   generation excludes it.  And I will ask of you in turn, How is He God
   if He is created?  For that which is created is not God.  I refrain
   from reminding you that here too is passion if we take the creation in
   a bodily sense, as time, desire, imagination, thought, hope, pain,
   risk, failure, success, all of which and more than all find a place in
   the creature, as is evident to every one.  Nay, I marvel that you do
   not venture so far as to conceive of marriages and times of pregnancy,
   and dangers of miscarriage, as if the Father could not have begotten at
   all if He had not begotten thus; or again, that you did not count up
   the modes of generation of birds and beasts and fishes, and bring under
   some one of them the Divine and Ineffable Generation, or even eliminate
   the Son out of your new hypothesis.  And you cannot even see this, that
   as His Generation according to the flesh differs from all others (for
   where among men do you know of a Virgin Mother?), so does He differ
   also in His spiritual Generation; or rather He, Whose Existence is not
   the same as ours, differs from us also in His Generation.

   V.  Who then is that Father Who had no beginning?  One Whose very
   Existence had no beginning; for one whose existence had a beginning
   must also have begun to be a Father.  He did not then become a Father
   after He began to be, for His being had no beginning.  And He is Father
   in the absolute sense, for He is not also Son; just as the Son is Son
   in the absolute sense, because He is not also Father.  These names do
   not belong to us in the absolute sense, because we are both, and not
   one more than the other; and we are of both, and not of one only; and
   so we are divided, and by degrees become men, and perhaps not even men,
   and such as we did not desire, leaving and being left, so that only the
   relations remain, without the underlying facts. [3512]

   But, the objector says, the very form of the expression "He begat" and
   "He was begotten," brings in the idea of a beginning of generation.
   But what if you do not use this expression, but say, "He had been
   begotten from the beginning" so as readily to evade your far-fetched
   and time-loving objections?  Will you bring Scripture against us, as if
   we were forging something contrary to Scripture and to the truth?  Why,
   every one knows that in practice we very often find tenses interchanged
   when time is spoken of; and especially is this the custom of Holy
   Scripture, not only in respect of the past tense, and of the present;
   but even of the future, as for instance "Why did the heathen rage?"
   [3513] when they had not yet raged and "they shall cross over the river
   on foot," [3514] where the meaning is they did cross over.  It would be
   a long task to reckon up all the expressions of this kind which
   students have noticed.

   VI.  So much for this point.  What is their next objection, how full of
   contentiousness and impudence?  He, they say, either voluntarily begat
   the Son, or else involuntarily.  Next, as they think, they bind us on
   both sides with cords; these however are not strong, but very weak.
   For, they say, if it was involuntarily He was under the sway of some
   one, and who exercised this sway?  And how is He, over whom it is
   exercised, God?  But if voluntarily, the Son is a Son of Will; how then
   is He of the Father?--and they thus invent a new sort of Mother for
   him,--the Will,--in place of the Father.  There is one good point which
   they may allege about this argument of theirs; namely, that they desert
   Passion, and take refuge in Will.  For Will is not Passion.

   Secondly, let us look at the strength of their argument.  And it were
   best to wrestle with them at first at close quarters.  You yourself,
   who so recklessly assert whatever takes your fancy; were you begotten
   voluntarily or involuntarily by your father?  If involuntarily, then he
   was under some tyrant's sway (O terrible violence!) and who was the
   tyrant?  You will hardly say it was nature,--for nature is tolerant of
   chastity.  If it was voluntarily, then by a few syllables your father
   is done away with, for you are shewn to be the son of Will, and not of
   your father.  But I pass to the relation between God and the creature,
   and I put your own question to your own wisdom.  Did God create all
   things voluntarily or under compulsion?  If under compulsion, here also
   is the tyranny, and one who played the tyrant; if voluntarily, the
   creatures also are deprived of their God, and you before the rest, who
   invent such arguments and tricks of logic.  For a partition is set up
   between the Creator and the creatures in the shape of Will.  And yet I
   think that the Person who wills is distinct from the Act of willing; He
   who begets from the Act of begetting; the Speaker from the speech, or
   else we are all very stupid.  On the one side we have the mover, and on
   the other that which is, so to speak, the motion.  Thus the thing
   willed is not the child of will, for it does not always result
   therefrom; nor is that which is begotten the child of generation, nor
   that which is heard the child of speech, but of the Person who willed,
   or begat, or spoke.  But the things of God are beyond all this, for
   with Him perhaps the Will to beget is generation, and there is no
   intermediate action (if we may accept this altogether, and not rather
   consider generation superior to will).

   VII.  Will you then let me play a little upon this word Father, for
   your example encourages me to be so bold?  The Father is God either
   willingly or unwillingly; and how will you escape from your own
   excessive acuteness?  If willingly, when did He begin to will?  It
   could not have been before He began to be, for there was nothing prior
   to Him.  Or is one part of Him Will and another the object of Will?  If
   so, He is divisible.  So the question arises, as the result of your
   argument, whether He Himself is not the Child of Will.  And if
   unwillingly, what compelled Him to exist, and how is He God if He was
   compelled--and that to nothing less than to be God?  How then was He
   begotten, says my opponent.  How was He created, if as you say, He was
   created?  For this is a part of the same difficulty.  Perhaps you would
   say, By Will and Word.  You have not yet solved the whole difficulty;
   for it yet remains for you to shew how Will and Word gained the power
   of action.  For man was not created in this way.

   VIII.  How then was He begotten?  This Generation would have been no
   great thing, if you could have comprehended it who have no real
   knowledge even of your own generation, or at least who comprehend very
   little of it, and of that little you are ashamed to speak; and then do
   you think you know the whole?  You will have to undergo much labour
   before you discover the laws of composition, formation, manifestation,
   and the bond whereby soul is united to body,--mind to soul, and reason
   to mind; and movement, increase, assimilation of food, sense, memory,
   recollection, and all the rest of the parts of which you are
   compounded; and which of them belongs to the soul and body together,
   and which to each independently of the other, and which is received
   from each other.  For those parts whose maturity comes later, yet
   received their laws at the time of conception.  Tell me what these laws
   are?  And do not even then venture to speculate on the Generation of
   God; for that would be unsafe.  For even if you knew all about your
   own, yet you do not by any means know about God's.  And if you do not
   understand your own, how can you know about God's?  For in proportion
   as God is harder to trace out than man, so is the heavenly Generation
   harder to comprehend than your own.  But if you assert that because you
   cannot comprehend it, therefore He cannot have been begotten, it will
   be time for you to strike out many existing things which you cannot
   comprehend; and first of all God Himself.  For you cannot say what He
   is, even if you are very reckless, and excessively proud of your
   intelligence.  First, cast away your notions of flow and divisions and
   sections, and your conceptions of immaterial as if it were material
   birth, and then you may perhaps worthily conceive of the Divine
   Generation.  How was He begotten?--I repeat the question in
   indignation.  The Begetting of God must be honoured by silence.  It is
   a great thing for you to learn that He was begotten.  But the manner of
   His generation we will not admit that even Angels can conceive, much
   less you.  Shall I tell you how it was?  It was in a manner known to
   the Father Who begat, and to the Son Who was begotten.  Anything more
   than this is hidden by a cloud, and escapes your dim sight.

   IX.  Well, but the Father begat a Son who either was or was not in
   existence. [3515]   What utter nonsense!  This is a question which
   applies to you or me, who on the one hand were in existence, as for
   instance Levi in the loins of Abraham; [3516] and on the other hand
   came into existence; and so in some sense we are partly of what
   existed, and partly of what was nonexistent; whereas the contrary is
   the case with the original matter, which was certainly created out of
   what was non-existent, notwithstanding that some pretend that it is
   unbegotten.  But in this case "to be begotten," even from the
   beginning, is concurrent with "to be."  On what then will you base this
   captious question?  For what is older than that which is from the
   beginning, if we may place there the previous existence or
   non-existence of the Son?  In either case we destroy its claim to be
   the Beginning.  Or perhaps you will say, if we were to ask you whether
   the Father was of existent or non-existent substance, that he is
   twofold, partly pre-existing, partly existing; or that His case is the
   same with that of the Son; that is, that He was created out of
   non-existing matter, because of your ridiculous questions and your
   houses of sand, which cannot stand against the merest ripple.

   I do not admit either solution, and I declare that your question
   contains an absurdity, and not a difficulty to answer.  If however you
   think, in accordance with your dialectic assumptions, that one or other
   of these alternatives must necessarily be true in every case, let me
   ask you one little question:  Is time in time, or is it not in time?
   If it is contained in time, then in what time, and what is it but that
   time, and how does it contain it?  But if it is not contained in time,
   what is that surpassing wisdom which can conceive of a time which is
   timeless?  Now, in regard to this expression, "I am now telling a lie,"
   admit one of these alternatives, either that it is true, or that it is
   a falsehood, without qualification (for we cannot admit that it is
   both).  But this cannot be.  For necessarily he either is lying, and so
   is telling the truth, or else he is telling the truth, and so is
   lying.  What wonder is it then that, as in this case contraries are
   true, so in that case they should both be untrue, and so your clever
   puzzle prove mere foolishness?  Solve me one more riddle.  Were you
   present at your own generation, and are you now present to yourself, or
   is neither the case?  If you were and are present, who were you, and
   with whom are you present?  And how did your single self become thus
   both subject and object?  But if neither of the above is the case, how
   did you get separated from yourself, and what is the cause of this
   disjoining?  But, you will say, it is stupid to make a fuss about the
   question whether or no a single individual is present to himself; for
   the expression is not used of oneself but of others.  Well, you may be
   certain that it is even more stupid to discuss the question whether
   That which was begotten from the beginning existed before its
   generation or not.  For such a question arises only as to matter
   divisible by time.

   X.  But they say, The Unbegotten and the Begotten are not the same; and
   if this is so, neither is the Son the same as the Father.  It is clear,
   without saying so, that this line of argument manifestly excludes
   either the Son or the Father from the Godhead.  For if to be Unbegotten
   is the Essence of God, to be begotten is not that Essence; if the
   opposite is the case, the Unbegotten is excluded.  What argument can
   contradict this?  Choose then whichever blasphemy you prefer, my good
   inventor of a new theology, if indeed you are anxious at all costs to
   embrace a blasphemy.  In the next place, in what sense do you assert
   that the Unbegotten and the Begotten are not the same?  If you mean
   that the Uncreated and the created are not the same, I agree with you;
   for certainly the Unoriginate and the created are not of the same
   nature.  But if you say that He That begat and That which is begotten
   are not the same, the statement is inaccurate.  For it is in fact a
   necessary truth that they are the same.  For the nature of the relation
   of Father to Child is this, that the offspring is of the same nature
   with the parent.  Or we may argue thus again.  What do you mean by
   Unbegotten and Begotten, for if you mean the simple fact of being
   unbegotten or begotten, these are not the same; but if you mean Those
   to Whom these terms apply, how are They not the same?  For example,
   Wisdom and Unwisdom are not the same in themselves, but yet both are
   attributes of man, who is the same; and they mark not a difference of
   essence, but one external to the essence. [3517]   Are immortality and
   innocence and immutability also the essence of God?  If so God has many
   essences and not one; or Deity is a compound of these.  For He cannot
   be all these without composition, if they be essences.

   XI.  They do not however assert this, for these qualities are common
   also to other beings.  But God's Essence is that which belongs to God
   alone, and is proper to Him.  But they, who consider matter and form to
   be unbegotten, would not allow that to be unbegotten is the property of
   God alone (for we must cast away even further the darkness of the
   Manichæans). [3518]   But suppose that it is the property of God
   alone.  What of Adam?  Was he not alone the direct creature of God?
   Yes, you will say.  Was he then the only human being?  By no means.
   And why, but because humanity does not consist in direct creation?  For
   that which is begotten is also human.  Just so neither is He Who is
   Unbegotten alone God, though He alone is Father.  But grant that He Who
   is Begotten is God; for He is of God, as you must allow, even though
   you cling to your Unbegotten.  Then how do you describe the Essence of
   God?  Not by declaring what it is, but by rejecting what it is not.
   For your word signifies that He is not begotten; it does not present to
   you what is the real nature or condition of that which has no
   generation.  What then is the Essence of God?  It is for your
   infatuation to define this, since you are so anxious about His
   Generation too; but to us it will be a very great thing, if ever, even
   in the future, we learn this, when this darkness and dulness is done
   away for us, as He has promised Who cannot lie.  This then may be the
   thought and hope of those who are purifying themselves with a view to
   this.  Thus much we for our part will be bold to say, that if it is a
   great thing for the Father to be Unoriginate, it is no less a thing for
   the Son to have been Begotten of such a Father.  For not only would He
   share the glory of the Unoriginate, since he is of the Unoriginate, but
   he has the added glory of His Generation, a thing so great and august
   in the eyes of all those who are not altogether grovelling and material
   in mind.

   XII.  But, they say, if the Son is the Same as the Father in respect of
   Essence, then if the Father is unbegotten, the Son must be so
   likewise.  Quite so--if the Essence of God consists in being
   unbegotten; and so He would be a strange mixture, begottenly
   unbegotten.  If, however, the difference is outside the Essence, how
   can you be so certain in speaking of this?  Are you also your father's
   father, so as in no respect to fall short of your father, since you are
   the same with him in essence?  Is it not evident that our enquiry into
   the Nature of the Essence of God, if we make it, will leave Personality
   absolutely unaffected?  But that Unbegotten is not a synonym of God is
   proved thus.  If it were so, it would be necessary that since God is a
   relative term, Unbegotten should be so likewise; or that since
   Unbegotten is an absolute term, so must God be....God of no one.  For
   words which are absolutely identical are similarly applied.  But the
   word Unbegotten is not used relatively.  For to what is it relative?
   And of what things is God the God?  Why, of all things.  How then can
   God and Unbegotten be identical terms?  And again, since Begotten and
   Unbegotten are contradictories, like possession and deprivation, it
   would follow that contradictory essences would co-exist, which is
   impossible. [3519]   Or again, since possessions are prior to
   deprivations, and the latter are destructive of the former, not only
   must the Essence of the Son be prior to that of the Father, but it must
   be destroyed by the Father, on your hypothesis.

   XIII.  What now remains of their invincible arguments?  Perhaps the
   last they will take refuge in is this.  If God has never ceased to
   beget, the Generation is imperfect; and when will He cease?  But if He
   has ceased, then He must have begun.  Thus again these carnal minds
   bring forward carnal arguments.  Whether He is eternally begotten or
   not, I do not yet say, until I have looked into the statement, "Before
   all the hills He begetteth Me," [3520] more accurately.  But I cannot
   see the necessity of their conclusion.  For if, as they say, everything
   that is to come to an end had also a beginning, then surely that which
   has no end had no beginning.  What then will they decide concerning the
   soul, or the Angelic nature?  If it had a beginning, it will also have
   an end; and if it has no end, it is evident that according to them it
   had no beginning.  But the truth is that it had a beginning, and will
   never have an end.  Their assertion, then, that which will have an end
   had also a beginning, is untrue.  Our position, however, is, that as in
   the case of a horse, or an ox, or a man, the same definition applies to
   all the individuals of the same species, and whatever shares the
   definition has also a right to the Name; so in the very same way there
   is One Essence of God, and One Nature, and One Name; although in
   accordance with a distinction in our thoughts we use distinct Names and
   that whatever is properly called by this Name really is God; and what
   He is in Nature, That He is truly called--if at least we are to hold
   that Truth is a matter not of names but of realities.  But our
   opponents, as if they were afraid of leaving any stone unturned to
   subvert the Truth, acknowledge indeed that the Son is God when they are
   compelled to do so by arguments [3521] and evidences; but they only
   mean that He is God in an ambiguous sense, and that He only shares the
   Name.

   XIV.  And when we advance this objection against them, "What do you
   mean to say then?  That the Son is not properly God, just as a picture
   of an animal is not properly an animal?  And if not properly God, in
   what sense is He God at all?"  They reply, Why should not these terms
   be ambiguous, and in both cases be used in a proper sense?  And they
   will give us such instances as the land-dog and the dogfish; where the
   word Dog is ambiguous, and yet in both cases is properly used, for
   there is such a species among the ambiguously named, or any other case
   in which the same appellative is used for two things of different
   nature.  But, my good friend, in this case, when you include two
   natures under the same name, you do not assert that either is better
   than the other, or that the one is prior and the other posterior, or
   that one is in a greater degree and the other in a lesser that which is
   predicated of them both, for there is no connecting link which forces
   this necessity upon them.  One is not a dog more than the other, and
   one less so; either the dogfish more than the land-dog, or the land-dog
   than the dogfish.  Why should they be, or on what principle?  But the
   community of name is here between things of equal value, though of
   different nature.  But in the case of which we are speaking, you couple
   the Name of God with adorable Majesty, and make It surpass every
   essence and nature (an attribute of God alone), and then you ascribe
   this Name to the Father, while you deprive the Son of it, and make Him
   subject to the Father, and give Him only a secondary honour and
   worship; and even if in words you bestow on Him one which is Equal, yet
   in practice you cut off His Deity, and pass malignantly from a use of
   the same Name implying an exact equality, to one which connects things
   which are not equal.  And so the pictured and the living man are in
   your mouth an apter illustration of the relations of Deity than the
   dogs which I instanced.  Or else you must concede to both an equal
   dignity of nature as well as a common name--even though you introduced
   these natures into your argument as different; and thus you destroy the
   analogy of your dogs, which you invented as an instance of inequality.
   For what is the force of your instance of ambiguity, if those whom you
   distinguish are not equal in honour?  For it was not to prove an
   equality but an inequality that you took refuge in your dogs.  How
   could anybody be more clearly convicted of fighting both against his
   own arguments, and against the Deity?

   XV.  And if, when we admit that in respect of being the Cause the
   Father is greater than the Son, they should assume the premiss that He
   is the Cause by Nature, and then deduce the conclusion that He is
   greater by Nature also, it is difficult to say whether they mislead
   most themselves or those with whom they are arguing.  For it does not
   absolutely follow that all that is predicated of a class can also be
   predicated of all the individuals composing it; for the different
   particulars may belong to different individuals.  For what hinders me,
   if I assume the same premiss, namely, that the Father is greater by
   Nature, and then add this other, Yet not by nature in every respect
   greater nor yet Father--from concluding, Therefore the Greater is not
   in every respect greater, nor the Father in every respect Father?  Or,
   if you prefer it, let us put it in this way:  God is an Essence:  But
   an Essence is not in every case God; and draw the conclusion for
   yourself--Therefore God is not in every case God.  I think the fallacy
   here is the arguing from a conditioned to an unconditioned use of a
   term, [3522] to use the technical expression of the logicians.  For
   while we assign this word Greater to His Nature viewed as a Cause, they
   infer it of His Nature viewed in itself.  It is just as if when we said
   that such a one was a dead man they were to infer simply that he was a
   Man.

   XVI.  How shall we pass over the following point, which is no less
   amazing than the rest?  Father, they say, is a name either of an
   essence or of an Action, thinking to bind us down on both sides.  If we
   say that it is a name of an essence, they will say that we agree with
   them that the Son is of another Essence, since there is but one Essence
   of God, and this, according to them, is preoccupied by the Father.  On
   the other hand, if we say that it is the name of an Action, we shall be
   supposed to acknowledge plainly that the Son is created and not
   begotten.  For where there is an Agent there must also be an Effect.
   And they will say they wonder how that which is made can be identical
   with That which made it.  I should myself have been frightened with
   your distinction, if it had been necessary to accept one or other of
   the alternatives, and not rather put both aside, and state a third and
   truer one, namely, that Father is not a name either of an essence or of
   an action, most clever sirs.  But it is the name of the Relation in
   which the Father stands to the Son, and the Son to the Father.  For as
   with us these names make known a genuine and intimate relation, so, in
   the case before us too, they denote an identity of nature between Him
   That is begotten and Him That begets.  But let us concede to you that
   Father is a name of essence, it will still bring in the idea of Son,
   and will not make it of a different nature, according to common ideas
   and the force of these names.  Let it be, if it so please you, the name
   of an action; you will not defeat us in this way either.  The
   Homoousion would be indeed the result of this action, or otherwise the
   conception of an action in this matter would be absurd.  You see then
   how, even though you try to fight unfairly, we avoid your sophistries.
   But now, since we have ascertained how invincible you are in your
   arguments and sophistries, let us look at your strength in the Oracles
   of God, if perchance you may choose to persuade us out of them.

   XVII.  For we have learnt to believe in and to teach the Deity of the
   Son from their great and lofty utterances.  And what utterances are
   these?  These:  God--The Word--He That Was In The Beginning and With
   The Beginning, and The Beginning.  "In the Beginning was The Word, and
   the Word was with God, and the Word was God," [3523] and "With Thee is
   the Beginning," [3524] and "He who calleth her The Beginning from
   generations." [3525]   Then the Son is Only-begotten:  The only
   "begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, it says, He hath
   declared Him." [3526]   The Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light.  "I am
   the Way, the Truth, and the Life;" and "I am the Light of the World."
   [3527]   Wisdom and Power, "Christ, the Wisdom of God, and the Power of
   God." [3528]   The Effulgence, the Impress, the Image, the Seal; "Who
   being the Effulgence of His glory and the Impress of His Essence,"
   [3529] and "the Image of His Goodness," [3530] and "Him hath God the
   Father sealed." [3531]   Lord, King, He That Is, The Almighty.  "The
   Lord rained down fire from the Lord;" [3532] and "A sceptre of
   righteousness is the sceptre of Thy Kingdom;" [3533] and "Which is and
   was and is to come, the Almighty" [3534] --all which are clearly spoken
   of the Son, with all the other passages of the same force, none of
   which is an afterthought, or added later to the Son or the Spirit, any
   more than to the Father Himself.  For Their Perfection is not affected
   by additions.  There never was a time when He was without the Word, or
   when He was not the Father, or when He was not true, or not wise, or
   not powerful, or devoid of life, or of splendour, or of goodness.

   But in opposition to all these, do you reckon up for me the expressions
   which make for your ignorant arrogance, such as "My God and your God,"
   [3535] or greater, or created, or made, or sanctified; [3536] Add, if
   you like, Servant [3537] and Obedient [3538] and Gave [3539] and
   Learnt, [3540] and was commanded, [3541] was sent, [3542] can do
   nothing of Himself, either say, or judge, or give, or will. [3543]
   And further these,--His ignorance, [3544] subjection, [3545] prayer,
   [3546] asking, [3547] increase, [3548] being made perfect. [3549]   And
   if you like even more humble than these; such as speak of His sleeping,
   [3550] hungering, [3551] being in an agony, [3552] and fearing; [3553]
   or perhaps you would make even His Cross and Death a matter of reproach
   to Him.  His Resurrection and Ascension I fancy you will leave to me,
   for in these is found something to support our position.  A good many
   other things too you might pick up, if you desire to put together that
   equivocal and intruded god of yours, Who to us is True God, and equal
   to the Father.  For every one of these points, taken separately, may
   very easily, if we go through them one by one, be explained to you in
   the most reverent sense, and the stumbling-block of the letter be
   cleaned away--that is, if your stumbling at it be honest, and not
   wilfully malicious.  To give you the explanation in one sentence.  What
   is lofty you are to apply to the Godhead, and to that Nature in Him
   which is superior to sufferings and incorporeal; but all that is lowly
   to the composite condition [3554] of Him who for your sakes made
   Himself of no reputation and was Incarnate--yes, for it is no worse
   thing to say, was made Man, and afterwards was also exalted.  The
   result will be that you will abandon these carnal and grovelling
   doctrines, and learn to be more sublime, and to ascend with His
   Godhead, and you will not remain permanently among the things of sight,
   but will rise up with Him into the world of thought, and come to know
   which passages refer to His Nature, and which to His assumption of
   Human Nature. [3555]

   XIX.  For He Whom you now treat with contempt was once above you.  He
   Who is now Man was once the Uncompounded.  What He was He continued to
   be; what He was not He took to Himself. [3556]   In the beginning He
   was, uncaused; for what is the Cause of God?  But afterwards for a
   cause He was born.  And that cause was that you might be saved, who
   insult Him and despise His Godhead, because of this, that He took upon
   Him your denser nature, having converse with Flesh by means of Mind.
   [3557]   While His inferior Nature, the Humanity, became God, because
   it was united to God, and became One Person [3558] because the Higher
   Nature prevailed in order that I too might be made God so far as He is
   made Man. [3559]   He was born--but He had been begotten:  He was born
   of a woman--but she was a Virgin.  The first is human, the second
   Divine.  In His Human nature He had no Father, but also in His Divine
   Nature no Mother. [3560]   Both these [3561] belong to Godhead.  He
   dwelt in the womb--but He was recognized by the Prophet, [3562] himself
   still in the womb, leaping before the Word, for Whose sake He came into
   being.  He was wrapped in swaddling clothes [3563] --but He took off
   the swathing bands of the grave by His rising again.  He was laid in a
   manger--but He was glorified by Angels, and proclaimed by a star, and
   worshipped by the Magi.  Why are you offended by that which is
   presented to your sight, because you will not look at that which is
   presented to your mind?  He was driven into exile into Egypt--but He
   drove away the Egyptian idols. [3564]   He had no form nor comeliness
   in the eyes of the Jews [3565] --but to David He is fairer than the
   children of men. [3566]   And on the Mountain He was bright as the
   lightning, and became more luminous than the sun, [3567] initiating us
   into the mystery of the future.

   XX.  He was baptized as Man--but He remitted sins as God [3568] --not
   because He needed purificatory rites Himself, but that He might
   sanctify the element of water.  He was tempted as Man, but He conquered
   as God; yea, He bids us be of good cheer, for He has overcome the
   world. [3569]   He hungered--but He fed thousands; [3570] yea, He is
   the Bread that giveth life, and That is of heaven.  He thirsted--but He
   cried, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink. [3571]   Yea,
   He promised that fountains should flow from them that believe.  He was
   wearied, but He is the Rest of them that are weary and heavy laden.
   [3572]   He was heavy with sleep, but He walked lightly over the sea.
   [3573]   He rebuked the winds, He made Peter light as he began to sink.
   [3574]   He pays tribute, but it is out of a fish; [3575] yea, He is
   the King of those who demanded it. [3576]   He is called a Samaritan
   and a demoniac; [3577] --but He saves him that came down from Jerusalem
   and fell among thieves; [3578] the demons acknowledge Him, and He
   drives out demons and sinks in the sea legions of foul spirits, [3579]
   and sees the Prince of the demons falling like lightning. [3580]   He
   is stoned, but is not taken.  He prays, but He hears prayer.  He weeps,
   but He causes tears to cease.  He asks where Lazarus was laid, for He
   was Man; but He raises Lazarus, for He was God. [3581]   He is sold,
   and very cheap, for it is only for thirty pieces of silver; [3582] but
   He redeems the world, and that at a great price, for the Price was His
   own blood. [3583]   As a sheep He is led to the slaughter, [3584] but
   He is the Shepherd of Israel, and now of the whole world also.  As a
   Lamb He is silent, yet He is the Word, and is proclaimed by the Voice
   of one crying in the wilderness. [3585]   He is bruised and wounded,
   but He healeth every disease and every infirmity. [3586]   He is lifted
   up and nailed to the Tree, but by the Tree of Life He restoreth us;
   yea, He saveth even the Robber crucified with Him; [3587] yea, He
   wrapped the visible world in darkness.  He is given vinegar to drink
   mingled with gall.  Who?  He who turned the water into wine [3588] ,
   who is the destroyer of the bitter taste, who is Sweetness and
   altogether desire. [3589]   He lays down His life, but He has power to
   take it again; [3590] and the veil is rent, for the mysterious doors of
   Heaven are opened; the rocks are cleft, the dead arise. [3591]   He
   dies, but He gives life, and by His death destroys death.  He is
   buried, but He rises again; He goes down into Hell, but He brings up
   the souls; He ascends to Heaven, and shall come again to judge the
   quick and the dead, and to put to the test such words as yours.  If the
   one give you a starting point for your error, let the others put an end
   to it.

   XXI.  This, then, is our reply to those who would puzzle us; not given
   willingly indeed (for light talk and contradictions of words are not
   agreeable to the faithful, and one Adversary is enough for us), but of
   necessity, for the sake of our assailants (for medicines exist because
   of diseases), that they may be led to see that they are not all-wise
   nor invincible in those superfluous arguments which make void the
   Gospel.  For when we leave off believing, and protect ourselves by mere
   strength of argument, and destroy the claim which the Spirit has upon
   our faith by questionings, and then our argument is not strong enough
   for the importance of the subject (and this must necessarily be the
   case, since it is put in motion by an organ of so little power as is
   our mind), what is the result?  The weakness of the argument appears to
   belong to the mystery, and thus elegance of language makes void the
   Cross, as Paul also thought. [3592]   For faith is that which completes
   our argument.  But may He who proclaimeth unions and looseth those that
   are bound, and who putteth into our minds to solve the knots of their
   unnatural dogmas, if it may be, change these men and make them faithful
   instead of rhetoricians, Christians instead of that which they now are
   called.  This indeed we entreat and beg for Christ's sake.  Be ye
   reconciled to God, [3593] and quench not the Spirit; [3594] or rather,
   may Christ be reconciled to you, and may the Spirit enlighten you,
   though so late.  But if you are too fond of your quarrel, we at any
   rate will hold fast to the Trinity, and by the Trinity may we be saved,
   remaining pure and without offence, until the more perfect shewing
   forth of that which we desire, in Him, Christ our Lord, to Whom be the
   glory for ever.  Amen.

   [3507] Heb. ii. 4; x. 38.

   [3508] Billius and others here read Authority, which is not supported
   by the best mss., or by the context.

   [3509] Elias explains this to mean that of old men knew only One Person
   in the Godhead:  and until the Incarnation this knowledge was
   sufficient; but from that time forward they acknowledged a Second
   Person, and through Him a Third also, the Holy Ghost.  But this
   explanation falls far short of Gregory's meaning, which certainly is
   that the movement of self-consciousness in God from all Eternity made
   the Generation of the Son, and the Procession of the Holy Ghost, a
   necessity.  All is objective in God.  cf. Petav. de Deo, II., viii.,
   16; also, Greg. Naz., Or. xxiii. 5.

   [3510] proboleus-probole was a term used by the Gnostics to describe
   the Emanations by which the distance between the Finite and the
   Infinite was according to them bridged over; and on this account it
   fell under suspicion, and was rejected by both Arius and Athanasius.
   Tertullian used it with an explanation which is satisfactory as regards
   the probole of the Son; but when he comes to apply it to the Procession
   of the Holy Ghost he uses an illustration which is in almost the very
   words rejected by Gregory (c. Prax., 7, 8.  See Swete, p. 56).  Origen
   did not admit it.  Later when this danger was past, the word came into
   use again as the equivalent of ekporeusis, at first with reserve and
   explanations in the text, but later on as an accepted term.  See Swete
   ,"On The Doctrine Of The Holy Spirit," p. 36.

   [3511] The expression is from Plato.

   [3512] Elias explains this to refer to the fact that children leave and
   are left by parents; or else to the death of either one or the other.

   [3518] The Manichæans, who believed in two eternal principles of good
   and evil, light and darkness, held that darkness too was unbegotten
   (Elias).

   [3519] Because "Son" implies "begotten."  But (ex hyp.) "Unbegotten" is
   synonymous with "God."

   [3554] S. Gregory often speaks of Human Nature as our composite being;
   and here he means the Sacred Humanity exclusively; there is no shadow
   of suspicion of Nestorianism or Eutychianism attaching to his name.

   [3555] The word oikonomia is used in four principal senses:  (a) The
   ministry of the Gospel, cf. Ephes. iii. 2; Col. i. 25; etc., and S.
   Cyril Hieros., has the expression "Economy of the Mystery" (Cat.
   xxv.).  It is also used absolutely by S. Chrysostom and others.  (b)
   The Providence of God, as by Epiphanius, Greg. Nyss., and others.  (c)
   The Incarnation, as in the text, without any epithet--in which use it
   is opposed to he theotes.  Sometimes however epithets are added.  (d)
   The whole Mystery of Redemption, including the Passion.

   [3556] cf. S. Leo, Serm. xxi., De Nativ. Dei, c. ii.  "Remaining what
   He was, and putting on what He was not, He united the true form of a
   servant to that form in which He was equal to God the Father, and
   combined both natures in a union so close that the lower was not
   consumed by receiving glory, nor the higher lessened by assuming
   lowliness.

   [3558] genomenos anthropos ho kato theos.  The passage is one of great
   difficulty.  Elias Cretensis renders the words as follows:--"Becoming
   Man, the inferior God, because humanity was" etc.; but his rendering is
   rejected as impossible by Petavius (de Incarn., IV., ix., 2, 3).  (i.)
   It is grammatically possible (Madvig, Gk. Syntax, 9 a. rem. 3) for ho
   kato, standing as it does, to qualify anthropos.  (ii.) But the kai
   genomenos ...theos may be taken as a nom. absolute, which would have
   been expressed by a gen. if anthropos had not been the same Person as
   homilesas.

   [3559] As by the Incarnation He who was God was made perfect Man, so
   Man was made perfect God, and each nature retained its own qualities.
   Or it may mean that God Incarnate was made Man in respect of body,
   soul, and mind; that is, in all points:  and the Humanity which He
   assumed was in all these points Deified; and therefore they who are His
   kindred and imitators share to that extent the Deification (Elias).  In
   the First Epistle to Cledonius (v. infra) the Priest, against
   Apollinarius, which is sometimes reckoned as the 51st Oration, S.
   Gregory says, "The Godhead and the Manhood are two natures, just as
   soul and body are.  But there are not two Sons or two Gods; although
   Paul did thus entangle the outward man and the inward.  And, to speak
   succinctly, the Natures which make our Saviour are distinct, for the
   Invisible is not the same as the visible, nor the Timeless as that
   which is subject to time; but He is not two Persons, God forbid, for
   both these are one in the union, God being made Man, and Man being made
   God, or however else you may express it."  And upon this S. Thomas
   Aquinas remarks that it is true, if by Man you understand simply Human
   Nature, and not a Human Person; in this sense it was brought to pass
   that Man was God; or in other words Human Nature was made that of the
   Son of God.  (Summa, III., xvi., 7.)

   [3560] "If any does not admit Mary to be the Mother of God (theotokon),
   he is separated from God.  If any say that He passed through the Virgin
   as through a conduit, and that He was not formed in her both divinely
   and humanly (divinely, because without a human father; humanly, because
   in accordance with the laws of gestation), he is in like manner
   atheistic.  If any assert that the Humanity was thus formed, and the
   Deity subsequently added, he is condemned; for this is not a generation
   of God, but an evasion of generation" (S. G. N. ad Cled., Ep. i.)  S.
   Thomas Aquinas explains the fitness of the title thus:  The Blessed
   Virgin could be denied to be the Mother of God only if either His
   Humanity had been conceived and born before That Man was the Son of
   God:--which was the position taken up by Photinus; or else if the
   Humanity had not been assumed into the unity of the Person (or
   Hypostasis) of the Son of God;--which was the position of Nestorius.
   Both these positions are erroneous.  Therefore to deny that the Blessed
   Virgin is the Mother of God is heretical (Summa, III.. xxxv. 4).  In
   the text S. Gregory merely means that the Godhead of our Lord was not
   derived from His Blessed Mother, just as his Manhood was not derived
   from any man; but, as the extract at the beginning of this Note shews,
   he would be the last to take up the Nestorian notion, which was
   afterwards condemned at the Council of Ephesus.

   [3561] Both These, i.e., the being without Father, and without Mother
   is a condition which belongs only to the Godhead.

   Oration XXX.

   The Fourth Theological Oration, Which is the Second Concerning the Son.

   I.  Since I have by the power of the Spirit sufficiently overthrown the
   subtleties and intricacies of the arguments, and already solved in the
   mass the objections and oppositions drawn from Holy Scripture, with
   which these sacrilegious robbers of the Bible and thieves of the sense
   of its contents draw over the multitude to their side, and confuse the
   way of truth; and that not without clearness, as I believe all candid
   persons will say; attributing to the Deity the higher and diviner
   expressions, and the lower and more human to Him Who for us men was the
   Second Adam, and was God made capable of suffering to strive against
   sin; yet we have not yet gone through the passages in detail, because
   of the haste of our argument.  But since you demand of us a brief
   explanation of each of them, that you may not be carried away by the
   plausibilities of their arguments, we will therefore state the
   explanations summarily, dividing them into numbers for the sake of
   carrying them more easily in mind.

   II.  In their eyes the following is only too ready to hand "The Lord
   created me at the beginning of His ways with a view to His works."
   [3595]   How shall we meet this?  Shall we bring an accusation against
   Solomon, or reject his former words because of his fall in after-life?
   Shall we say that the words are those of Wisdom herself, as it were of
   Knowledge and the Creator-word, in accordance with which all things
   were made?  For Scripture often personifies many even lifeless objects;
   as for instance, "The Sea said" [3596] so and so; and, "The Depth
   saith, It is not in me;" [3597] and "The Heavens declare the glory of
   God;" [3598] and again a command is given to the Sword; [3599] and the
   Mountains and Hills are asked the reason of their skipping. [3600]   We
   do not allege any of these, though some of our predecessors used them
   as powerful arguments.  But let us grant that the expression is used of
   our Saviour Himself, the true Wisdom.  Let us consider one small point
   together.  What among all things that exist is unoriginate?  The
   Godhead.  For no one can tell the origin of God, that otherwise would
   be older than God.  But what is the cause of the Manhood, which for our
   sake God assumed?  It was surely our Salvation.  What else could it
   be?  Since then we find here clearly both the Created and the Begetteth
   Me, the argument is simple.  Whatever we find joined with a cause we
   are to refer to the Manhood, but all that is absolute and unoriginate
   we are to reckon to the account of His Godhead.  Well, then, is not
   this "Created" said in connection with a cause?  He created Me, it so
   says, as the beginning of His ways, with a view to his works.  Now, the
   Works of His Hands are verity and judgment; [3601] for whose sake He
   was anointed with Godhead; [3602] for this anointing is of the Manhood;
   but the "He begetteth Me" is not connected with a cause; or it is for
   you to shew the adjunct.  What argument then will disprove that Wisdom
   is called a creature, in connection with the lower generation, but
   Begotten in respect of the first and more incomprehensible?

   III.  Next is the fact of His being called Servant [3603] and serving
   many well, and that it is a great thing for Him to be called the Child
   of God.  For in truth He was in servitude to flesh and to birth and to
   the conditions of our life with a view to our liberation, and to that
   of all those whom He has saved, who were in bondage under sin.  What
   greater destiny can befall man's humility than that he should be
   intermingled with God, and by this intermingling should be deified,
   [3604] and that we should be so visited by the Dayspring from on high,
   [3605] that even that Holy Thing that should be born should be called
   the Son of the Highest, [3606] and that there should be bestowed upon
   Him a Name which is above every name?  And what else can this be than
   God?--and that every knee should bow to Him That was made of no
   reputation for us, and That mingled the Form of God with the form of a
   servant, and that all the House of Israel should know that God hath
   made Him both Lord and Christ? [3607]   For all this was done by the
   action of the Begotten, and by the good pleasure of Him That begat Him.

   IV.  Well, what is the second of their great irresistible passages?
   "He must reign," [3608] till such and such a time...and "be received by
   heaven until the time of restitution," [3609] and "have the seat at the
   Right Hand until the overthrow of His enemies." [3610]   But after
   this?  Must He cease to be King, or be removed from Heaven?  Why, who
   shall make Him cease, or for what cause?  What a bold and very
   anarchical interpreter you are; and yet you have heard that Of His
   Kingdom there shall be no end. [3611]   Your mistake arises from not
   understanding that Until is not always exclusive of that which comes
   after, but asserts up to that time, without denying what comes after
   it.  To take a single instance--how else would you understand, "Lo, I
   am with you always, even unto the end of the world?" [3612]   Does it
   mean that He will no longer be so afterwards.  And for what reason?
   But this is not the only cause of your error; you also fail to
   distinguish between the things that are signified.  He is said to reign
   in one sense as the Almighty King, both of the willing and the
   unwilling; but in another as producing in us submission, and placing us
   under His Kingship as willingly acknowledging His Sovereignty.  Of His
   Kingdom, considered in the former sense, there shall be no end.  But in
   the second sense, what end will there be?  His taking us as His
   servants, on our entrance into a state of salvation.  For what need is
   there to Work Submission in us when we have already submitted?  After
   which He arises to judge the earth, and to separate the saved from the
   lost.  After that He is to stand as God in the midst of gods, [3613]
   that is, of the saved, distinguishing and deciding of what honour and
   of what mansion each is worthy.

   V.  Take, in the next place, the subjection by which you subject the
   Son to the Father.  What, you say, is He not now subject, or must He,
   if He is God, be subject to God? [3614]   You are fashioning your
   argument as if it concerned some robber, or some hostile deity.  But
   look at it in this manner:  that as for my sake He was called a curse,
   [3615] Who destroyed my curse; and sin, [3616] who taketh away the sin
   of the world; and became a new Adam [3617] to take the place of the
   old, just so He makes my disobedience His own as Head of the whole
   body.  As long then as I am disobedient and rebellious, both by denial
   of God and by my passions, so long Christ also is called disobedient on
   my account.  But when all things shall be subdued unto Him on the one
   hand by acknowledgment of Him, and on the other by a reformation, then
   He Himself also will have fulfilled His submission, bringing me whom He
   has saved to God.  For this, according to my view, is the subjection of
   Christ; namely, the fulfilling of the Father's Will.  But as the Son
   subjects all to the Father, so does the Father to the Son; the One by
   His Work, the Other by His good pleasure, as we have already said.  And
   thus He Who subjects presents to God that which he has subjected,
   making our condition His own.  Of the same kind, it appears to me, is
   the expression, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" [3618]
   It was not He who was forsaken either by the Father, or by His own
   Godhead, as some have thought, as if It were afraid of the Passion, and
   therefore withdrew Itself from Him in His Sufferings (for who compelled
   Him either to be born on earth at all, or to be lifted up on the
   Cross?)  But as I said, He was in His own Person representing us.  For
   we were the forsaken and despised before, but now by the Sufferings of
   Him Who could not suffer, we were taken up and saved.  Similarly, He
   makes His own our folly and our transgressions; and says what follows
   in the Psalm, for it is very evident that the Twenty-first [3619] Psalm
   refers to Christ.

   VI.  The same consideration applies to another passage, "He learnt
   obedience by the things which He suffered," [3620] and to His "strong
   crying and tears," and His "Entreaties," and His "being heard," and
   His" Reverence," all of which He wonderfully wrought out, like a drama
   whose plot was devised on our behalf.  For in His character of the Word
   He was neither obedient nor disobedient.  For such expressions belong
   to servants, and inferiors, and the one applies to the better sort of
   them, while the other belongs to those who deserve punishment.  But, in
   the character of the Form of a Servant, He condescends to His fellow
   servants, nay, to His servants, and takes upon Him a strange form,
   bearing all me and mine in Himself, that in Himself He may exhaust the
   bad, as fire does wax, or as the sun does the mists of earth; and that
   I may partake of His nature by the blending.  Thus He honours obedience
   by His action, and proves it experimentally by His Passion.  For to
   possess the disposition is not enough, just as it would not be enough
   for us, unless we also proved it by our acts; for action is the proof
   of disposition.

   And perhaps it would not be wrong to assume this also, that by the art
   [3621] of His love for man He gauges our obedience, and measures all by
   comparison with His own Sufferings, so that He may know our condition
   by His own, and how much is demanded of us, and how much we yield,
   taking into the account, along with our environment, our weakness
   also.  For if the Light shining through the veil [3622] upon the
   darkness, that is upon this life, was persecuted by the other darkness
   (I mean, the Evil One and the Tempter), how much more will the darkness
   be persecuted, as being weaker than it?  And what marvel is it, that
   though He entirely escaped, we have been, at any rate in part,
   overtaken?  For it is a more wonderful thing that He should have been
   chased than that we should have been captured;--at least to the minds
   of all who reason aright on the subject.  I will add yet another
   passage to those I have mentioned, because I think that it clearly
   tends to the same sense.  I mean "In that He hath suffered being
   tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted." [3623]   But God
   will be all in all in the time of restitution; not in the sense that
   the Father alone will Be; and the Son be wholly resolved into Him, like
   a torch into a great pyre, from which it was reft away for a little
   space, and then put back (for I would not have even the Sabellians
   injured [3624] by such an expression); but the entire Godhead...when we
   shall be no longer divided (as we now are by movements and passions),
   and containing nothing at all of God, or very little, but shall be
   entirely like.

   VII.  As your third point you count the Word Greater; [3625] and as
   your fourth, To My God and your God. [3626]   And indeed, if He had
   been called greater, and the word equal had not occurred, this might
   perhaps have been a point in their favour.  But if we find both words
   clearly used what will these gentlemen have to say?  How will it
   strengthen their argument?  How will they reconcile the
   irreconcilable?  For that the same thing should be at once greater than
   and equal to the same thing is an impossibility; and the evident
   solution is that the Greater refers to origination, while the Equal
   belongs to the Nature; and this we acknowledge with much good will.
   But perhaps some one else will back up our attack on your argument, and
   assert, that That which is from such a Cause is not inferior to that
   which has no Cause; for it would share the glory of the Unoriginate,
   because it is from the Unoriginate.  And there is, besides, the
   Generation, which is to all men a matter so marvellous and of such
   Majesty.  For to say that he is greater than the Son considered as man,
   is true indeed, but is no great thing.  For what marvel is it if God is
   greater than man?  Surely that is enough to say in answer to their talk
   about Greater.

   VIII.  As to the other passages, My God would be used in respect, not
   of the Word, but of the Visible Word.  For how could there be a God of
   Him Who is properly God?  In the same way He is Father, not of the
   Visible, but of the Word; for our Lord was of two Natures; so that one
   expression is used properly, the other improperly in each of the two
   cases; but exactly the opposite way to their use in respect of us.  For
   with respect to us God is properly our God, but not properly our
   Father.  And this is the cause of the error of the Heretics, namely the
   joining of these two Names, which are interchanged because of the Union
   of the Natures.  And an indication of this is found in the fact that
   wherever the Natures are distinguished in our thoughts from one
   another, the Names are also distinguished; as you hear in Paul's words,
   "The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory." [3627]   The
   God of Christ, but the Father of glory.  For although these two terms
   express but one Person, yet this is not by a Unity of Nature, but by a
   Union of the two.  What could be clearer?

   IX.  Fifthly, let it be alleged that it is said of Him that He receives
   life, [3628] judgment, [3629] inheritance of the Gentiles, [3630] or
   power over all flesh, [3631] or glory, [3632] or disciples, or whatever
   else is mentioned.  This also belongs to the Manhood; and yet if you
   were to ascribe it to the Godhead, it would be no absurdity.  For you
   would not so ascribe it as if it were newly acquired, but as belonging
   to Him from the beginning by reason of nature, and not as an act of
   favour.

   X.  Sixthly, let it be asserted that it is written, The Son can do
   nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do. [3633]   The
   solution of this is as follows:--Can and Cannot are not words with only
   one meaning, but have many meanings.  On the one hand they are used
   sometimes in respect of deficiency of strength, sometimes in respect of
   time, and sometimes relatively to a certain object; as for instance, A
   Child cannot be an Athlete, or, A Puppy cannot see, or fight with so
   and so.  Perhaps some day the child will be an athlete, the puppy will
   see, will fight with that other, though it may still be unable to fight
   with Any other.  Or again, they may be used of that which is Generally
   true.  For instance,--A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid;
   [3634] while yet it might possibly be hidden by another higher hill
   being in a line with it.  Or in another sense they are used of a thing
   which is not reasonable; as, Can the Children of the Bridechamber fast
   while the Bridegroom is with them; [3635] whether He be considered as
   visible in bodily form (for the time of His sojourning among us was not
   one of mourning, but of gladness), or, as the Word.  For why should
   they keep a bodily fast who are cleansed by the Word? [3636]   Or,
   again, they are used of that which is contrary to the will; as in, He
   could do no mighty works there because of their unbelief, [3637] --i.e.
   of those who should receive them.  For since in order to healing there
   is need of both faith in the patient and power in the Healer, [3638]
   when one of the two failed the other was impossible.  But probably this
   sense also is to be referred to the head of the unreasonable.  For
   healing is not reasonable in the case of those who would afterwards be
   injured by unbelief.  The sentence The world cannot hate you, [3639]
   comes under the same head, as does also How can ye, being evil, speak
   good things? [3640]   For in what sense is either impossible, except
   that it is contrary to the will?  There is a somewhat similar meaning
   in the expressions which imply that a thing impossible by nature is
   possible to God if He so wills; [3641] as that a man cannot be born a
   second time, [3642] or that a needle will not let a camel through it.
   [3643]   For what could prevent either of these things happening, if
   God so willed?

   XI.  And besides all this, there is the absolutely impossible and
   inadmissible, as that which we are now examining.  For as we assert
   that it is impossible for God to be evil, or not to exist--for this
   would be indicative of weakness in God rather than of strength--or for
   the non-existent to exist, or for two and two to make both four and
   ten, [3644] so it is impossible and inconceivable that the Son should
   do anything that the Father doeth not. [3645]   For all things that the
   Father hath are the Son's; [3646] and on the other hand, all that
   belongs to the Son is the Father's.  Nothing then is peculiar, because
   all things are in common.  For Their Being itself is common and equal,
   even though the Son receive it from the Father.  It is in respect of
   this that it is said I live by the Father; [3647] not as though His
   Life and Being were kept together by the Father, but because He has His
   Being from Him beyond all time, and beyond all cause.  But how does He
   see the Father doing, and do likewise?  Is it like those who copy
   pictures and letters, because they cannot attain the truth unless by
   looking at the original, and being led by the hand by it?  But how
   shall Wisdom stand in need of a teacher, or be incapable of acting
   unless taught?  And in what sense does the Father "Do" in the present
   or in the past?  Did He make another world before this one, or is He
   going to make a world to come?  And did the Son look at that and make
   this?  Or will He look at the other, and make one like it?  According
   to this argument there must be Four worlds, two made by the Father, and
   two by the Son.  What an absurdity!  He cleanses lepers, and delivers
   men from evil spirits, and diseases, and quickens the dead, and walks
   upon the sea, and does all His other works; but in what case, or when
   did the Father do these acts before Him?  Is it not clear that the
   Father impressed the ideas of these same actions, and the Word brings
   them to pass, yet not in slavish or unskilful fashion, but with full
   knowledge and in a masterly way, or, to speak more properly, like the
   Father?  For in this sense I understand the words that whatsoever is
   done by the Father, these things doeth the Son likewise; not, that is,
   because of the likeness of the things done, but in respect of the
   Authority.  This might well also be the meaning of the passage which
   says that the Father worketh hitherto and the Son also; [3648] and not
   only so but it refers also to the government and preservation of the
   things which He has made; as is shewn by the passage which says that He
   maketh His Angels Spirits, [3649] and that the earth is founded upon
   its steadfastness (though once for all these things were fixed and
   made) and that the thunder is made firm and the wind created. [3650]
   Of all these things the Word was given once, but the Action is
   continuous even now.

   XII.  Let them quote in the seventh place that The Son came down from
   Heaven, not to do His own Will, but the Will of Him That sent Him.
   [3651]   Well, if this had not been said by Himself Who came down, we
   should say that the phrase was modelled as issuing from the Human
   Nature, not from Him who is conceived of in His character as the
   Saviour, for His Human Will cannot be opposed to God, seeing it is
   altogether taken into God; but conceived of simply as in our nature,
   inasmuch as the human will does not completely follow the Divine, but
   for the most part struggles against and resists it.  For we understand
   in the same way the words, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
   from Me; Nevertheless let not what I will but Thy Will prevail. [3652]
     For it is not likely that He did not know whether it was possible or
   not, or that He would oppose will to will.  But since, as this is the
   language of Him Who assumed our Nature (for He it was Who came down),
   and not of the Nature which He assumed, we must meet the objection in
   this way, that the passage does not mean that the Son has a special
   will of His own, besides that of the Father, but that He has not; so
   that the meaning would be, "not to do Mine own Will, for there is none
   of Mine apart from, but that which is common to, Me and Thee; for as We
   have one Godhead, so We have one Will." [3653]   For many such
   expressions are used in relation to this Community, and are expressed
   not positively but negatively; as, e.g., God giveth not the Spirit by
   measure, [3654] for as a matter of fact He does not give the Spirit to
   the Son, nor does He measure It, for God is not measured by God; or
   again, Not my transgression nor my sin. [3655]   The words are not used
   because He has these things, but because He has them not.  And again,
   Not for our righteousness which we have done, [3656] for we have not
   done any.  And this meaning is evident also in the clauses which
   follow.  For what, says He, is the Will of My Father?  That everyone
   that believeth on the Son should be saved, [3657] and obtain the final
   Resurrection. [3658]   Now is this the Will of the Father, but not of
   the Son?  Or does He preach the Gospel, and receive men's faith against
   His will?  Who could believe that?  Moreover, that passage, too, which
   says that the Word which is heard is not the Son's [3659] but the
   Father's has the same force.  For I cannot see how that which is common
   to two can be said to belong to one alone, however much I consider it,
   and I do not think any one else can.  If then you hold this opinion
   concerning the Will, you will be right and reverent in your opinion, as
   I think, and as every right-minded person thinks.

   XIII.  The eighth passage is, That they may know Thee, the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent; [3660] and There is none
   good save one, that is, God. [3661]   The solution of this appears to
   me very easy.  For if you attribute this only to the Father, where will
   you place the Very Truth?  For if you conceive in this manner of the
   meaning of To the only wise God, [3662] or Who only hath Immortality,
   Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, [3663] or of to
   the king of the Ages, immortal, invisible, and only wise God, [3664]
   then the Son has vanished under sentence of death, or of darkness, or
   at any rate condemned to be neither wise nor king, nor invisible, nor
   God at all, which sums up all these points.  And how will you prevent
   His Goodness, which especially belongs to God alone, from perishing
   with the rest?  I, however, think that the passage That they may know
   Thee the only true God, was said to overthrow those gods which are
   falsely so called, for He would not have added and Jesus Christ Whom
   Thou hast sent, if The Only True God were contrasted with Him, and the
   sentence did not proceed upon the basis of a common Godhead.  The "None
   is Good" meets the tempting Lawyer, who was testifying to His Goodness
   viewed as Man.  For perfect goodness, He says, is God's alone, even if
   a man is called perfectly good.  As for instance, A good man out of the
   good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things. [3665]   And, I
   will give the kingdom to one who is good above Thee. [3666] ...Words of
   God, speaking to Saul about David.  Or again, Do good, O Lord, unto the
   good [3667] ...and all other like expressions concerning those of us
   who are praised, upon whom it is a kind of effluence from the Supreme
   Good, and has come to them in a secondary degree.  It will be best of
   all if we can persuade you of this.  But if not, what will you say to
   the suggestion on the other side, that on your hypothesis the Son has
   been called the only God.  In what passage?  Why, in this:--This is
   your God; no other shall be accounted of in comparison with Him, and a
   little further on, after this did He shew Himself upon earth, and
   conversed with men. [3668]   This addition proves clearly that the
   words are not used of the Father, but of the Son; for it was He Who in
   bodily form companied with us, and was in this lower world.  Now, if we
   should determine to take these words as said in contrast with the
   Father, and not with the imaginary gods, we lose the Father by the very
   terms which we were pressing against the Son.  And what could be more
   disastrous than such a victory?

   XIV.  Ninthly, they allege, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession
   for us. [3669]   O, how beautiful and mystical and kind.  For to
   intercede does not imply to seek for vengeance, as is most men's way
   (for in that there would be something of humiliation), but it is to
   plead for us by reason of His Mediatorship, just as the Spirit also is
   said to make intercession for us. [3670]   For there is One God, and
   One Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus. [3671]   For He
   still pleads even now as Man for my salvation; for He continues to wear
   the Body which He assumed, until He make me God by the power of His
   Incarnation; although He is no longer known after the flesh [3672] --I
   mean, the passions of the flesh, the same, except sin, as ours.  Thus
   too, we have an Advocate, [3673] Jesus Christ, not indeed prostrating
   Himself for us before the Father, and falling down before Him in
   slavish fashion...Away with a suspicion so truly slavish and unworthy
   of the Spirit!  For neither is it seemly for the Father to require
   this, nor for the Son to submit to it; nor is it just to think it of
   God.  But by what He suffered as Man, He as the Word and the Counsellor
   persuades Him to be patient.  I think this is the meaning of His
   Advocacy.

   XV.  Their tenth objection is the ignorance, and the statement that Of
   the last day and hour knoweth no man, not even the Son Himself, but the
   Father. [3674]   And yet how can Wisdom be ignorant of anything--that
   is, Wisdom Who made the worlds, Who perfects them, Who remodels them,
   Who is the Limit of all things that were made, Who knoweth the things
   of God as the spirit of a man knows the things that are in him? [3675]
     For what can be more perfect than this knowledge?  How then can you
   say that all things before that hour He knows accurately, and all
   things that are to happen about the time of the end, but of the hour
   itself He is ignorant?  For such a thing would be like a riddle; as if
   one were to say that he knew accurately all that was in front of the
   wall, but did not know the wall itself; or that, knowing the end of the
   day, he did not know the beginning of the night--where knowledge of the
   one necessarily brings in the other.  Thus everyone must see that He
   knows as God, and knows not as Man;--if one may separate the visible
   from that which is discerned by thought alone.  For the absolute and
   unconditioned use of the Name "The Son" in this passage, without the
   addition of whose Son, gives us this thought, that we are to understand
   the ignorance in the most reverent sense, by attributing it to the
   Manhood, and not to the Godhead.

   XVI.  If then this argument is sufficient, let us stop here, and not
   enquire further.  But if not, our second argument is as follows:--Just
   as we do in all other instances, so let us refer His knowledge of the
   greatest events, in honour of the Father, to The Cause.  And I think
   that anyone, even if he did not read it in the way that one of our own
   Students [3676] did, would soon perceive that not even the Son knows
   the day or hour otherwise than as the Father does.  For what do we
   conclude from this?  That since the Father knows, therefore also does
   the Son, as it is evident that this cannot be known or comprehended by
   any but the First Nature.  There remains for us to interpret the
   passage about His receiving commandment, [3677] and having kept His
   Commandments, and done always those things that please Him; and further
   concerning His being made perfect, [3678] and His exaltation, [3679]
   and His learning obedience by the things which He suffered; and also
   His High Priesthood, and His Oblation, and His Betrayal, and His prayer
   to Him That was able to save Him from death, and His Agony and Bloody
   Sweat and Prayer, [3680] and such like things; if it were not evident
   to every one that such words are concerned, not with That Nature Which
   is unchangeable and above all capacity of suffering, but with the
   passible Humanity.  This, then, is the argument concerning these
   objections, so far as to be a sort of foundation and memorandum for the
   use of those who are better able to conduct the enquiry to a more
   complete working out.  It may, however, be worth while, and will be
   consistent with what has been already said, instead of passing over
   without remark the actual Titles of the Son (there are many of them,
   and they are concerned with many of His Attributes), to set before you
   the meaning of each of them, and to point out the mystical meaning of
   the names.

   XVII.  We will begin thus.  The Deity cannot be expressed in words.
   And this is proved to us, not only by argument, but by the wisest and
   most ancient of the Hebrews, so far as they have given us reason for
   conjecture.  For they appropriated certain characters to the honour of
   the Deity, and would not even allow the name of anything inferior to
   God to be written with the same letters as that of God, because to
   their minds it was improper that the Deity should even to that extent
   admit any of His creatures to a share with Himself.  How then could
   they have admitted that the invisible and separate Nature can be
   explained by divisible words?  For neither has any one yet breathed the
   whole air, nor has any mind entirely comprehended, or speech
   exhaustively contained the Being of God.  But we sketch Him by His
   Attributes, and so obtain a certain faint and feeble and partial idea
   concerning Him, and our best Theologian is he who has, not indeed
   discovered the whole, for our present chain does not allow of our
   seeing the whole, but conceived of Him to a greater extent than
   another, and gathered in himself more of the Likeness or adumbration of
   the Truth, or whatever we may call it.

   XVIII.  As far then as we can reach, He Who Is, and God, are the
   special names of His Essence; and of these especially He Who Is, not
   only because when He spake to Moses in the mount, and Moses asked what
   His Name was, this was what He called Himself, bidding him say to the
   people "I Am hath sent me," [3681] but also because we find that this
   Name is the more strictly appropriate.  For the Name Theos (God), even
   if, as those who are skilful in these matters say, it were derived from
   Theein [3682] (to run) or from Aithein (to blaze), from continual
   motion, and because He consumes evil conditions of things (from which
   fact He is also called A Consuming Fire), [3683] would still be one of
   the Relative Names, and not an Absolute one; as again is the case with
   Lord, [3684] which also is called a name of God.  I am the Lord Thy
   God, He says, that is My name; [3685] and, The Lord is His name. [3686]
     But we are enquiring into a Nature Whose Being is absolute and not
   into Being bound up with something else.  But Being is in its proper
   sense peculiar to God, and belongs to Him entirely, and is not limited
   or cut short by any Before or After, for indeed in him there is no past
   or future.

   XIX.  Of the other titles, some are evidently names of His Authority,
   others of His Government of the world, and of this viewed under a
   twofold aspect, the one before the other in the Incarnation.  For
   instance the Almighty, the King of Glory, or of The Ages, or of The
   Powers, or of The Beloved, or of Kings.  Or again the Lord of Sabaoth,
   that is of Hosts, or of Powers, or of Lords; these are clearly titles
   belonging to His Authority.  But the God either of Salvation or of
   Vengeance, or of Peace, or of Righteousness; or of Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob, and of all the spiritual Israel that seeth God,--these belong to
   His Government.  For since we are governed by these three things, the
   fear of punishment, the hope of salvation and of glory besides, and the
   practice of the virtues by which these are attained, the Name of the
   God of Vengeance governs fear, and that of the God of Salvation our
   hope, and that of the God of Virtues our practice; that whoever attains
   to any of these may, as carrying God in himself, press on yet more unto
   perfection, and to that affinity which arises out of virtues.  Now
   these are Names common to the Godhead, but the Proper Name of the
   Unoriginate is Father, and that of the unoriginately Begotten is Son,
   and that of the unbegottenly Proceeding or going forth is The Holy
   Ghost.  Let us proceed then to the Names of the Son, which were our
   starting point in this part of our argument.

   XX.  In my opinion He is called Son because He is identical with the
   Father in Essence; and not only for this reason, but also because He is
   Of Him.  And He is called Only-Begotten, not because He is the only Son
   and of the Father alone, and only a Son; but also because the manner of
   His Sonship is peculiar to Himself and not shared by bodies.  And He is
   called the Word, because He is related to the Father as Word to Mind;
   not only on account of His passionless Generation, but also because of
   the Union, and of His declaratory function.  Perhaps too this relation
   might be compared to that between the Definition and the Thing defined
   [3687] since this also is called Logos. [3688]   For, it says, he that
   hath mental perception of the Son (for this is the meaning of Hath
   Seen) hath also perceived the Father; [3689] and the Son is a concise
   demonstration and easy setting forth of the Father's Nature.  For every
   thing that is begotten is a silent word of him that begat it.  And if
   any one should say that this Name was given Him because He exists in
   all things that are, he would not be wrong.  For what is there that
   consists but by the word?  He is also called Wisdom, as the Knowledge
   of things divine and human.  For how is it possible that He Who made
   all things should be ignorant of the reasons of what He has made?  And
   Power, as the Sustainer of all created things, and the Furnisher to
   them of power to keep themselves together.  And Truth, as being in
   nature One and not many (for truth is one and falsehood is manifold),
   and as the pure Seal of the Father and His most unerring Impress.  And
   the Image as of one substance with Him, and because He is of the
   Father, and not the Father of Him.  For this is of the Nature of an
   Image, to be the reproduction of its Archetype, and of that whose name
   it bears; only that there is more here.  For in ordinary language an
   image is a motionless representation of that which has motion; but in
   this case it is the living reproduction of the Living One, and is more
   exactly like than was Seth to Adam, [3690] or any son to his father.
   For such is the nature of simple Existences, that it is not correct to
   say of them that they are Like in one particular and Unlike in another;
   but they are a complete resemblance, and should rather be called
   Identical than Like.  Moreover he is called Light as being the
   Brightness of souls cleansed by word and life.  For if ignorance and
   sin be darkness, knowledge and a godly life will be Light....And He is
   called Life, because He is Light, and is the constituting and creating
   Power of every reasonable soul.  For in Him we live and move and have
   our being, [3691] according to the double power of that Breathing into
   us; for we were all inspired by Him with breath, [3692] and as many of
   us as were capable of it, and in so far as we open the mouth of our
   mind, with God the Holy Ghost.  He is Righteousness, because He
   distributes according to that which we deserve, and is a righteous
   Arbiter both for those who are under the Law and for those who are
   under Grace, for soul and body, so that the former should rule, and the
   latter obey, and the higher have supremacy over the lower; that the
   worse may not rise in rebellion against the better.  He is
   Sanctification, as being Purity, that the Pure may be contained by
   Purity.  And Redemption, because He sets us free, who were held captive
   under sin, giving Himself a Ransom for us, the Sacrifice to make
   expiation for the world.  And Resurrection, because He raises up from
   hence, and brings to life again us, who were slain by sin.

   XXI.  These names however are still common to Him Who is above us, and
   to Him Who came for our sake.  But others are peculiarly our own, and
   belong to that nature which He assumed.  So He is called Man, not only
   that through His Body He may be apprehended by embodied creatures,
   whereas otherwise this would be impossible because of His
   incomprehensible nature; but also that by Himself He may sanctify
   humanity, and be as it were a leaven to the whole lump; and by uniting
   to Himself that which was condemned may release it from all
   condemnation, becoming for all men all things that we are, except
   sin;--body, soul, mind and all through which death reaches--and thus He
   became Man, who is the combination of all these; God in visible form,
   because He retained that which is perceived by mind alone.  He is Son
   of Man, both on account of Adam, and of the Virgin from Whom He came;
   from the one as a forefather, from the other as His Mother, both in
   accordance with the law of generation, and apart from it.  He is
   Christ, because of His Godhead.  For this is the Anointing of His
   Manhood, and does not, as is the case with all other Anointed Ones,
   sanctify by its action, but by the Presence in His Fulness of the
   Anointing One; the effect of which is that That which anoints is called
   Man, and makes that which is anointed God.  He is The Way, because He
   leads us through Himself; The Door, as letting us in; the Shepherd, as
   making us dwell in a place of green pastures, [3693] and bringing us up
   by waters of rest, and leading us there, and protecting us from wild
   beasts, converting the erring, bringing back that which was lost,
   binding up that which was broken, guarding the strong, and bringing
   them together in the Fold beyond, with words of pastoral knowledge.
   The Sheep, as the Victim:  The Lamb, as being perfect:  the Highpriest,
   as the Offerer; Melchisedec, as without Mother in that Nature which is
   above us, and without Father in ours; and without genealogy above (for
   who, it says, shall declare His generation?) and moreover, as King of
   Salem, which means Peace, and King of Righteousness, and as receiving
   tithes from Patriarchs, when they prevail over powers of evil.  They
   are the titles of the Son.  Walk through them, those that are lofty in
   a godlike manner; those that belong to the body in a manner suitable to
   them; or rather, altogether in a godlike manner, that thou mayest
   become a god, ascending from below, for His sake Who came down from on
   high for ours.  In all and above all keep to this, and thou shalt never
   err, either in the loftier or the lowlier names; Jesus Christ is the
   Same yesterday and to-day in the Incarnation, and in the Spirit for
   ever and ever.  Amen.

   [3595] Prov. viii. 22.  The A.V. has in the place Possessed, and this
   has very high authority:  but the Hebrew word in almost every case
   signifies to Acquire.  It is used, says Bp. Wordsworth (ad h. l.),
   about eighty times in the O.T., and in only five places is it rendered
   in our Translation by Possess;--in two of which (Gen. xiv. 10, 22, and
   Ps. cxxxix. 13) it might well have the sense of Creating, and in two
   (Jer. xxxii. 15, and Zech. xi. 5) of Getting.  In some ancient Versions
   (LXX. and Syr.) it is rendered by Create.  S. Jerome in his Ep. ad
   Cypr. (ii. 697) says that the word may here be understood of
   possession, but in his Comm. on Ephes. ii. (p. 342) he adopts the
   rendering Create, which he applies to the Incarnation, as in several
   places does S. Athanasius.  But Wordsworth thinks it better to apply
   the words to the Eternal Generation, as S. Hilary expounds it (c.
   Arianos, who argued from it that Christ was a creature); "quia Filius
   Dei non corporalis parturitionis est genitus exemplo, sed ex perfecto
   Deo perfectus Deus natus; et ideo ait creatam se esse Sapientia; omnem
   in generatione sua notionem passionis corporalis excludens."

   The Fifth Theological Oration.

   On the Holy Spirit.

   I.  Such then is the account of the Son, and in this manner He has
   escaped those who would stone Him, passing through the midst of them.
   [3694]   For the Word is not stoned, but casts stones when He pleases;
   and uses a sling against wild beasts--that is, words--approaching the
   Mount [3695] in an unholy way.  But, they go on, what have you to say
   about the Holy Ghost?  From whence are you bringing in upon us this
   strange God, of Whom Scripture is silent?  And even they who keep
   within bounds as to the Son speak thus.  And just as we find in the
   case of roads and rivers, that they split off from one another and join
   again, so it happens also in this case, through the superabundance of
   impiety, that people who differ in all other respects have here some
   points of agreement, so that you never can tell for certain either
   where they are of one mind, or where they are in conflict.

   II.  Now the subject of the Holy Spirit presents a special difficulty,
   not only because when these men have become weary in their disputations
   concerning the Son, they struggle with greater heat against the Spirit
   (for it seems to be absolutely necessary for them to have some object
   on which to give expression to their impiety, or life would appear to
   them no longer worth living), but further because we ourselves also,
   being worn out by the multitude of their questions, are in something of
   the same condition with men who have lost their appetite; who having
   taken a dislike to some particular kind of food, shrink from all food;
   so we in like manner have an aversion from all discussions.  Yet may
   the Spirit grant it to us, and then the discourse will proceed, and God
   will be glorified.  Well then, we will leave to others [3696] who have
   worked upon this subject for us as well as for themselves, as we have
   worked upon it for them, the task of examining carefully and
   distinguishing in how many senses the word Spirit or the word Holy is
   used and understood in Holy Scripture, with the evidence suitable to
   such an enquiry; and of shewing how besides these the combination of
   the two words--I mean, Holy Spirit--is used in a peculiar sense; but we
   will apply ourselves to the remainder of the subject.

   III.  They then who are angry with us on the ground that we are
   bringing in a strange or interpolated God, viz.:--the Holy Ghost, and
   who fight so very hard for the letter, should know that they are afraid
   where no fear is; [3697] and I would have them clearly understand that
   their love for the letter is but a cloak for their impiety, as shall be
   shewn later on, when we refute their objections to the utmost of our
   power.  But we have so much confidence in the Deity of the Spirit Whom
   we adore, [3698] that we will begin our teaching concerning His Godhead
   by fitting to Him the Names which belong to the Trinity, even though
   some persons may think us too bold.  The Father was the True Light
   which lighteneth every man coming into the world.  The Son was the True
   Light which lighteneth every man coming into the world.  The Other
   Comforter was the True Light which lighteneth every man coming into the
   world. [3699]   Was and Was and Was, but Was One Thing.  Light thrice
   repeated; but One Light and One God.  This was what David represented
   to himself long before when he said, In Thy Light shall we see Light.
   [3700]   And now we have both seen and proclaim concisely and simply
   the doctrine [3701] of God the Trinity, comprehending out of Light (the
   Father), Light (the Son), in Light (the Holy Ghost).  He that rejects
   it, let him reject it; [3702] and he that doeth iniquity, let him do
   iniquity; we proclaim that which we have understood.  We will get us up
   into a high mountain, [3703] and will shout, if we be not heard, below;
   we will exalt the Spirit; we will not be afraid; or if we are afraid,
   it shall be of keeping silence, not of proclaiming.

   IV.  If ever there was a time when the Father was not, then there was a
   time when the Son was not.  If ever there was a time when the Son was
   not, then there was a time when the Spirit was not.  If the One was
   from the beginning, then the Three were so too.  If you throw down the
   One, I am bold to assert that you do not set up the other Two.  For
   what profit is there in an imperfect Godhead?  Or rather, what Godhead
   can there be if It is not perfect?  And how can that be perfect which
   lacks something of perfection?  And surely there is something lacking
   if it hath not the Holy, and how would it have this if it were without
   the Spirit?  For either holiness is something different from Him, and
   if so let some one tell me what it is conceived to be; or if it is the
   same, how is it not from the beginning, as if it were better for God to
   be at one time imperfect and apart from the Spirit?  If He is not from
   the beginning, He is in the same rank with myself, even though a little
   before me; for we are both parted from Godhead by time.  If He is in
   the same rank with myself, how can He make me God, or join me with
   Godhead?

   V.  Or rather, let me reason with you about Him from a somewhat earlier
   point, for we have already discussed the Trinity.  The Sadducees
   altogether denied the existence of the Holy Spirit, just as they did
   that of Angels and the Resurrection; rejecting, I know not upon what
   ground, the important testimonies concerning Him in the Old Testament.
   And of the Greeks those who are more inclined to speak of God, and who
   approach nearest to us, have formed some conception of Him, as it seems
   to me, though they have differed as to His Name, and have addressed Him
   as the Mind of the World, or the External Mind, and the like.  But of
   the wise men amongst ourselves, some have conceived of him as an
   Activity, some as a Creature, some as God; and some have been uncertain
   which to call Him, out of reverence for Scripture, they say, as though
   it did not make the matter clear either way.  And therefore they
   neither worship Him nor treat Him with dishonour, but take up a neutral
   position, or rather a very miserable one, with respect to Him.  And of
   those who consider Him to be God, some are orthodox in mind only, while
   others venture to be so with the lips also.  And I have heard of some
   who are even more clever, and measure Deity; and these agree with us
   that there are Three Conceptions; but they have separated these from
   one another so completely as to make one of them infinite both in
   essence and power, and the second in power but not in essence, and the
   third circumscribed in both; thus imitating in another way those who
   call them the Creator, the Co-operator, and the Minister, and consider
   that the same order and dignity which belongs to these names is also a
   sequence in the facts.

   VI.  But we cannot enter into any discussion with those who do not even
   believe in His existence, nor with the Greek babblers (for we would not
   be enriched in our argument with the oil of sinners). [3704]   With the
   others, however, we will argue thus.  The Holy Ghost must certainly be
   conceived of either as in the category of the Self-existent, or as in
   that of the things which are contemplated in another; of which classes
   those who are skilled in such matters call the one Substance and the
   other Accident.  Now if He were an Accident, He would be an Activity of
   God, for what else, or of whom else, could He be, for surely this is
   what most avoids composition?  And if He is an Activity, He will be
   effected, but will not effect and will cease to exist as soon as He has
   been effected, for this is the nature of an Activity.  How is it then
   that He acts and says such and such things, and defines, and is
   grieved, and is angered, and has all the qualities which belong clearly
   to one that moves, and not to movement?  But if He is a Substance and
   not an attribute of Substance, He will be conceived of either as a
   Creature of God, or as God.  For anything between these two, whether
   having nothing in common with either, or a compound of both, not even
   they who invented the goat-stag could imagine.  Now, if He is a
   creature, how do we believe in Him, how are we made perfect in Him?
   For it is not the same thing to believe IN a thing and to believe About
   it.  The one belongs to Deity, the other to--any thing.  But if He is
   God, then He is neither a creature, nor a thing made, nor a fellow
   servant, nor any of these lowly appellations.

   VII.  There--the word is with you.  Let the slings be let go; let the
   syllogism be woven.  Either He is altogether Unbegotten, or else He is
   Begotten.  If He is Unbegotten, there are two Unoriginates.  If he is
   Begotten, you must make a further subdivision.  He is so either by the
   Father or by the Son.  And if by the Father, there are two Sons, and
   they are Brothers.  And you may make them twins if you like, or the one
   older and the other younger, since you are so very fond of the bodily
   conceptions.  But if by the Son, then such a one will say, we get a
   glimpse of a Grandson God, than which nothing could be more absurd.
   For my part however, if I saw the necessity of the distinction, I
   should have acknowledged the facts without fear of the names.  For it
   does not follow that because the Son is the Son in some higher relation
   (inasmuch as we could not in any other way than this point out that He
   is of God and Consubstantial), it would also be necessary to think that
   all the names of this lower world and of our kindred should be
   transferred to the Godhead.  Or may be you would consider our God to be
   a male, according to the same arguments, because he is called God and
   Father, and that Deity is feminine, from the gender of the word, and
   Spirit neuter, because It has nothing to do with generation; But if you
   would be silly enough to say, with the old myths and fables, that God
   begat the Son by a marriage with His own Will, we should be introduced
   [3705] to the Hermaphrodite god of Marcion and Valentinus [3706] who
   imagined these newfangled Æons.

   VIII.  But since we do not admit your first division, which declares
   that there is no mean between Begotten and Unbegotten, at once, along
   with your magnificent division, away go your Brothers and your
   Grandsons, as when the first link of an intricate chain is broken they
   are broken with it, and disappear from your system of divinity.  For,
   tell me, what position will you assign to that which Proceeds, which
   has started up between the two terms of your division, and is
   introduced by a better Theologian than you, our Saviour Himself?  Or
   perhaps you have taken that word out of your Gospels for the sake of
   your Third Testament, The Holy Ghost, which proceedeth from the Father;
   [3707] Who, inasmuch as He proceedeth from That Source, is no Creature;
   and inasmuch as He is not Begotten is no Son; and inasmuch as He is
   between the Unbegotten and the Begotten is God.  And thus escaping the
   toils of your syllogisms, He has manifested himself as God, stronger
   than your divisions.  What then is Procession?  Do you tell me what is
   the Unbegottenness of the Father, and I will explain to you the
   physiology of the Generation of the Son and the Procession of the
   Spirit, and we shall both of us be frenzy-stricken for prying into the
   mystery of God. [3708]   And who are we to do these things, we who
   cannot even see what lies at our feet, or number the sand of the sea,
   or the drops of rain, or the days of Eternity, much less enter into the
   Depths of God, and supply an account of that Nature which is so
   unspeakable and transcending all words?

   IX.  What then, say they, is there lacking to the Spirit which prevents
   His being a Son, for if there were not something lacking He would be a
   Son?  We assert that there is nothing lacking--for God has no
   deficiency.  But the difference of manifestation, if I may so express
   myself, or rather of their mutual relations one to another, has caused
   the difference of their Names.  For indeed it is not some deficiency in
   the Son which prevents His being Father (for Sonship is not a
   deficiency), and yet He is not Father.  According to this line of
   argument there must be some deficiency in the Father, in respect of His
   not being Son.  For the Father is not Son, and yet this is not due to
   either deficiency or subjection of Essence; but the very fact of being
   Unbegotten or Begotten, or Proceeding has given the name of Father to
   the First, of the Son to the Second, and of the Third, Him of Whom we
   are speaking, of the Holy Ghost that the distinction of the Three
   Persons may be preserved in the one nature and dignity of the Godhead.
   For neither is the Son Father, for the Father is One, but He is what
   the Father is; nor is the Spirit Son because He is of God, for the
   Only-begotten is One, but He is what the Son is.  The Three are One in
   Godhead, and the One Three in properties; so that neither is the Unity
   a Sabellian one, [3709] nor does the Trinity countenance the present
   evil distinction.

   X.  What then?  Is the Spirit God?  Most certainly.  Well then, is He
   Consubstantial?  Yes, if He is God.  Grant me, says my opponent, that
   there spring from the same Source One who is a Son, and One who is not
   a Son, and these of One Substance with the Source, and I admit a God
   and a God.  Nay, if you will grant me that there is another God and
   another nature of God I will give you the same Trinity with the same
   name and facts.  But since God is One and the Supreme Nature is One,
   how can I present to you the Likeness?  Or will you seek it again in
   lower regions and in your own surroundings?  It is very shameful, and
   not only shameful, but very foolish, to take from things below a guess
   at things above, and from a fluctuating nature at the things that are
   unchanging, and as Isaiah says, to seek the Living among the dead.
   [3710]   But yet I will try, for your sake, to give you some assistance
   for your argument, even from that source.  I think I will pass over
   other points, though I might bring forward many from animal history,
   some generally known, others only known to a few, of what nature has
   contrived with wonderful art in connection with the generation of
   animals.  For not only are likes said to beget likes, and things
   diverse to beget things diverse, but also likes to be begotten by
   things diverse, and things diverse by likes.  And if we may believe the
   story, there is yet another mode of generation, when an animal is
   self-consumed and self-begotten. [3711]   There are also creatures
   which depart in some sort from their true natures, and undergo change
   and transformation from one creature into another, by a magnificence of
   nature.  And indeed sometimes in the same species part may be generated
   and part not; and yet all of one substance; which is more like our
   present subject.  I will just mention one fact of our own nature which
   every one knows, and then I will pass on to another part of the
   subject.

   XI.  What was Adam?  A creature of God.  What then was Eve?  A fragment
   of the creature.  And what was Seth?  The begotten of both.  Does it
   then seem to you that Creature and Fragment and Begotten are the same
   thing?  Of course it does not.  But were not these persons
   consubstantial?  Of course they were.  Well then, here it is an
   acknowledged fact that different persons may have the same substance.
   I say this, not that I would attribute creation or fraction or any
   property of body to the Godhead (let none of your contenders for a word
   be down upon me again), but that I may contemplate in these, as on a
   stage, things which are objects of thought alone.  For it is not
   possible to trace out any image exactly to the whole extent of the
   truth.  But, they say, what is the meaning of all this?  For is not the
   one an offspring, and the other a something else of the One?  Did not
   both Eve and Seth come from the one Adam?  And were they both begotten
   by him?  No; but the one was a fragment of him, and the other was
   begotten by him.  And yet the two were one and the same thing; both
   were human beings; no one will deny that.  Will you then give up your
   contention against the Spirit, that He must be either altogether
   begotten, or else cannot be consubstantial, or be God; and admit from
   human examples the possibility of our position?  I think it will be
   well for you, unless you are determined to be very quarrelsome, and to
   fight against what is proved to demonstration.

   XII.  But, he says, who in ancient or modern times ever worshipped the
   Spirit?  Who ever prayed to Him?  Where is it written that we ought to
   worship Him, or to pray to Him, and whence have you derived this tenet
   of yours?  We will give the more perfect reason hereafter, when we
   discuss the question of the unwritten; for the present it will suffice
   to say that it is the Spirit in Whom we worship, and in Whom we pray.
   For Scripture says, God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must
   worship Him in Spirit and in truth. [3712]   And again,--We know not
   what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Itself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; [3713] and
   I will pray with the Spirit and I will pray with the understanding
   also; [3714] --that is, in the mind and in the Spirit.  Therefore to
   adore or to pray to the Spirit seems to me to be simply Himself
   offering prayer or adoration to Himself.  And what godly or learned man
   would disapprove of this, because in fact the adoration of One is the
   adoration of the Three, because of the equality of honour and Deity
   between the Three?  So I will not be frightened by the argument that
   all things are said to have been made by the Son; [3715] as if the Holy
   Spirit also were one of these things.  For it says all things that were
   made, and not simply all things.  For the Father was not, nor were any
   of the things that were not made.  Prove that He was made, and then
   give Him to the Son, and number Him among the creatures; but until you
   can prove this you will gain nothing for your impiety from this
   comprehensive phrase.  For if He was made, it was certainly through
   Christ; I myself would not deny that.  But if He was not made, how can
   He be either one of the All, or through Christ?  Cease then to
   dishonour the Father in your opposition to the Only-begotten (for it is
   no real honour, by presenting to Him a creature to rob Him of what is
   more valuable, a Son), and to dishonour the Son in your opposition to
   the Spirit.  For He is not the Maker of a Fellow servant, but He is
   glorified with One of co-equal honour.  Rank no part of the Trinity
   with thyself, lest thou fall away from the Trinity; cut not off from
   Either the One and equally august Nature; because if thou overthrow any
   of the Three thou wilt have overthrown the whole.  Better to take a
   meagre view of the Unity than to venture on a complete impiety.

   XIII.  Our argument has now come to its principal point; and I am
   grieved that a problem that was long dead, and that had given way to
   faith, is now stirred up afresh; yet it is necessary to stand against
   these praters, and not to let judgment go by default, when we have the
   Word on our side, and are pleading the cause of the Spirit.  If, say
   they, there is God and God and God, how is it that there are not Three
   Gods, or how is it that what is glorified is not a plurality of
   Principles?  Who is it who say this?  Those who have reached a more
   complete ungodliness, or even those who have taken the secondary part;
   I mean who are moderate in a sense in respect of the Son.  For my
   argument is partly against both in common, partly against these latter
   in particular.  What I have to say in answer to these is as
   follows:--What right have you who worship the Son, even though you have
   revolted from the Spirit, to call us Tritheists?  Are not you
   Ditheists?  For if you deny also the worship of the Only Begotten, you
   have clearly ranged yourself among our adversaries.  And why should we
   deal kindly with you as not quite dead?  But if you do worship Him, and
   are so far in the way of salvation, we will ask you what reasons you
   have to give for your ditheism, if you are charged with it?  If there
   is in you a word of wisdom answer, and open to us also a way to an
   answer.  For the very same reason with which you will repel a charge of
   Ditheism will prove sufficient for us against one of Tritheism.  And
   thus we shall win the day by making use of you our accusers as our
   Advocates, than which nothing can be more generous.

   XIV.  What is our quarrel and dispute with both?  To us there is One
   God, for the Godhead is One, and all that proceedeth from Him is
   referred to One, though we believe in Three Persons.  For one is not
   more and another less God; nor is One before and another after; nor are
   They divided in will or parted in power; nor can you find here any of
   the qualities of divisible things; but the Godhead is, to speak
   concisely, undivided in separate Persons; and there is one mingling of
   Light, as it were of three suns joined to each other.  When then we
   look at the Godhead, or the First Cause, or the Monarchia, that which
   we conceive is One; but when we look at the Persons in Whom the Godhead
   dwells, and at Those Who timelessly and with equal glory have their
   Being from the First Cause--there are Three Whom we worship.

   XV.  What of that, they will say perhaps; do not the Greeks also
   believe in one Godhead, as their more advanced philosophers declare?
   And with us Humanity is one, namely the entire race; but yet they have
   many gods, not One, just as there are many men.  But in this case the
   common nature has a unity which is only conceivable in thought; and the
   individuals are parted from one another very far indeed, both by time
   and by dispositions and by power.  For we are not only compound beings,
   but also contrasted beings, both with one another and with ourselves;
   nor do we remain entirely the same for a single day, to say nothing of
   a whole lifetime, but both in body and in soul are in a perpetual state
   of flow and change.  And perhaps the same may be said of the Angels
   [3716] and the whole of that superior nature which is second to the
   Trinity alone; although they are simple in some measure and more fixed
   in good, owing to their nearness to the highest Good.

   XVI.  Nor do those whom the Greeks worship as gods, and (to use their
   own expression) dæmons, need us in any respect for their accusers, but
   are convicted upon the testimony of their own theologians, some as
   subject to passion, some as given to faction, and full of innumerable
   evils and changes, and in a state of opposition, not only to one
   another, but even to their first causes, whom they call Oceani and
   Tethyes and Phanetes, and by several other names; and last of all a
   certain god who hated his children through his lust of rule, and
   swallowed up all the rest through his greediness that he might become
   the father of all men and gods whom he miserably devoured, and then
   vomited forth again.  And if these are but myths and fables, as they
   say in order to escape the shamefulness of the story, what will they
   say in reference to the dictum that all things are divided into three
   parts, [3717] and that each god presides over a different part of the
   Universe, having a distinct province as well as a distinct rank?  But
   our faith is not like this, nor is this the portion of Jacob, says my
   Theologian. [3718]   But each of these Persons possesses Unity, not
   less with that which is United to it than with itself, by reason of the
   identity of Essence and Power. [3719]   And this is the account of the
   Unity, so far as we have apprehended it.  If then this account is the
   true one, let us thank God for the glimpse He has granted us; if it is
   not let us seek for a better.

   XVII.  As for the arguments with which you would overthrow the Union
   which we support, I know not whether we should say you are jesting or
   in earnest.  For what is this argument?  "Things of one essence, you
   say, are counted together," and by this "counted together," you mean
   that they are collected into one number. [3720]   But things which are
   not of one essence are not thus counted...so that you cannot avoid
   speaking of three gods, according to this account, while we do not run
   any risk at all of it, inasmuch as we assert that they are not
   consubstantial.  And so by a single word you have freed yourselves from
   trouble, and have gained a pernicious victory, for in fact you have
   done something like what men do when they hang themselves for fear of
   death.  For to save yourselves trouble in your championship of the
   Monarchia you have denied the Godhead, and abandoned the question to
   your opponents.  But for my part, even if labor should be necessary, I
   will not abandon the Object of my adoration.  And yet on this point I
   cannot see where the difficulty is.

   XVIII.  You say, Things of one essence are counted together, but those
   which are not consubstantial are reckoned one by one.  Where did you
   get this from?  From what teachers of dogma or mythology?  Do you not
   know that every number expresses the quantity of what is included under
   it, and not the nature of the things?  But I am so old fashioned, or
   perhaps I should say so unlearned, as to use the word Three of that
   number of things, even if they are of a different nature, and to use
   One and One and One in a different way of so many units, even if they
   are united in essence, looking not so much at the things themselves as
   at the quantity of the things in respect of which the enumeration is
   made.  But since you hold so very close to the letter (although you are
   contending against the letter), pray take your demonstrations from this
   source.  There are in the Book of Proverbs three things which go well,
   a lion, a goat, and a cock; and to these is added a fourth;--a King
   making a speech before the people, [3721] to pass over the other sets
   of four which are there counted up, although things of various
   natures.  And I find in Moses two Cherubim [3722] counted singly.  But
   now, in your technology, could either the former things be called
   three, when they differ so greatly in their nature, or the latter be
   treated as units when they are so closely connected and of one nature?
   For if I were to speak of God and Mammon, as two masters, reckoned
   under one head, when they are so very different from each other, I
   should probably be still more laughed at for such a connumeration.

   XIX.  But to my mind, he says, those things are said to be connumerated
   and of the same essence of which the names also correspond, as Three
   Men, or Three gods, but not Three this and that.  What does this
   concession amount to?  It is suitable to one laying down the law as to
   names, not to one who is asserting the truth.  For I also will assert
   that Peter and James and John are not three or consubstantial, so long
   as I cannot say Three Peters, or Three Jameses, or Three Johns; for
   what you have reserved for common names we demand also for proper
   names, in accordance with your arrangement; or else you will be unfair
   in not conceding to others what you assume for yourself.  What about
   John then, when in his Catholic Epistle he says that there are Three
   that bear witness, [3723] the Spirit and the Water and the Blood?  Do
   you think he is talking nonsense?  First, because he has ventured to
   reckon under one numeral things which are not consubstantial, though
   you say this ought to be done only in the case of things which are
   consubstantial.  For who would assert that these are consubstantial?
   Secondly, because he has not been consistent in the way he has happened
   upon his terms; for after using Three in the masculine gender he adds
   three words which are neuter, contrary to the definitions and laws
   which you and your grammarians have laid down.  For what is the
   difference between putting a masculine Three first, and then adding One
   and One and One in the neuter, or after a masculine One and One and One
   to use the Three not in the masculine but in the neuter, which you
   yourself disclaim in the case of Deity?  What have you to say about the
   Crab, which may mean either an animal, or an instrument, or a
   constellation?  And what about the Dog, now terrestrial, now aquatic,
   now celestial?  Do you not see that three crabs or dogs are spoken of?
   Why of course it is so.  Well then, are they therefore of one
   substance?  None but a fool would say that.  So you see how completely
   your argument from connumeration has broken down, and is refuted by all
   these instances.  For if things that are of one substance are not
   always counted under one numeral, and things not of one substance are
   thus counted, and the pronunciation of the name [3724] once for all is
   used in both cases, what advantage do you gain towards your doctrine?

   XX.  I will look also at this further point, which is not without its
   bearing on the subject.  One and One added together make Two; and Two
   resolved again becomes One and One, as is perfectly evident.  If,
   however, elements which are added together must, as your theory
   requires, be consubstantial, and those which are separate be
   heterogeneous, then it will follow that the same things must be both
   consubstantial and heterogeneous.  No:  I laugh at your Counting Before
   and your Counting After, of which you are so proud, as if the facts
   themselves depended upon the order of their names.  If this were so,
   according to the same law, since the same things are in consequence of
   the equality of their nature counted in Holy Scripture, sometimes in an
   earlier, sometimes in a later place, what prevents them from being at
   once more honourable and less honourable than themselves?  I say the
   same of the names God and Lord, and of the prepositions Of Whom, and By
   Whom, and In Whom, by which you describe the Deity according to the
   rules of art for us, attributing the first to the Father, the second to
   the Son, and the third to the Holy Ghost.  For what would you have
   done, if each of these expressions were constantly allotted to Each
   Person, when, the fact being that they are used of all the Persons, as
   is evident to those who have studied the question, you even so make
   them the ground of such inequality both of nature and dignity.  This is
   sufficient for all who are not altogether wanting in sense.  But since
   it is a matter of difficulty for you after you have once made an
   assault upon the Spirit, to check your rush, and not rather like a
   furious boar to push your quarrel to the bitter end, and to thrust
   yourself upon the knife until you have received the whole wound in your
   own breast; let us go on to see what further argument remains to you.

   XXI.  Over and over again you turn upon us the silence of Scripture.
   But that it is not a strange doctrine, nor an afterthought, but
   acknowledged and plainly set forth both by the ancients and many of our
   own day, is already demonstrated by many persons who have treated of
   this subject, and who have handled the Holy Scriptures, not with
   indifference or as a mere pastime, but have gone beneath the letter and
   looked into the inner meaning, and have been deemed worthy to see the
   hidden beauty, and have been irradiated by the light of knowledge.  We,
   however in our turn will briefly prove it as far as may be, in order
   not to seem to be over-curious or improperly ambitious, building on
   another's foundation.  But since the fact, that Scripture does not very
   clearly or very often write Him God in express words (as it does first
   the Father and afterwards the Son), becomes to you an occasion of
   blasphemy and of this excessive wordiness and impiety, we will release
   you from this inconvenience by a short discussion of things and names,
   and especially of their use in Holy Scripture.

   XXII.  Some things have no existence, but are spoken of; others which
   do exist are not spoken of; some neither exist nor are spoken of, and
   some both exist and are spoken of.  Do you ask me for proof of this?  I
   am ready to give it.  According to Scripture God sleeps and is awake,
   is angry, walks, has the Cherubim for His Throne.  And yet when did He
   become liable to passion, and have you ever heard that God has a body?
   This then is, though not really fact, a figure of speech.  For we have
   given names according to our own comprehension from our own attributes
   to those of God.  His remaining silent apart from us, and as it were
   not caring for us, for reasons known to Himself, is what we call His
   sleeping; for our own sleep is such a state of inactivity.  And again,
   His sudden turning to do us good is the waking up; for waking is the
   dissolution of sleep, as visitation is of turning away.  And when He
   punishes, we say He is angry; for so it is with us, punishment is the
   result of anger.  And His working, now here now there, we call walking;
   for walking is change from one place to another.  His resting among the
   Holy Hosts, and as it were loving to dwell among them, is His sitting
   and being enthroned; this, too, from ourselves, for God resteth nowhere
   as He doth upon the Saints.  His swiftness of moving is called flying,
   and His watchful care is called His Face, and his giving and bestowing
   [3725] is His hand; and, in a word, every other of the powers or
   activities of God has depicted for us some other corporeal one.

   XXIII.  Again, where do you get your Unbegotten and Unoriginate, those
   two citadels of your position, or we our Immortal?  Show me these in so
   many words, or we shall either set them aside, or erase them as not
   contained in Scripture; and you are slain by your own principle, the
   names you rely on being overthrown, and therewith the wall of refuge in
   which you trusted.  Is it not evident that they are due to passages
   which imply them, though the words do not actually occur?  What are
   these passages?--I am the first, and I am the last, [3726] and before
   Me there was no God, neither shall there be after Me. [3727]   For all
   that depends on that Am makes for my side, for it has neither beginning
   nor ending.  When you accept this, that nothing is before Him, and that
   He has not an older Cause, you have implicitly given Him the titles
   Unbegotten and Unoriginate.  And to say that He has no end of Being is
   to call Him Immortal and Indestructible.  The first pairs, then, that I
   referred to are accounted for thus.  But what are the things which
   neither exist in fact nor are said?  That God is evil; that a sphere is
   square; that the past is present; that man is not a compound being.
   Have you ever known a man of such stupidity as to venture either to
   think or to assert any such thing?  It remains to shew what are the
   things which exist, both in fact and in language.  God, Man, Angel,
   Judgment, Vanity (viz., such arguments as yours), and the subversion of
   faith and emptying of the mystery.

   XXIV.  Since, then, there is so much difference in terms and things,
   why are you such a slave to the letter, and a partisan of the Jewish
   wisdom, and a follower of syllables at the expense of facts?  But if,
   when you said twice five or twice seven, I concluded from your words
   that you meant Ten or Fourteen; or if, when you spoke of a rational and
   mortal animal, that you meant Man, should you think me to be talking
   nonsense?  Surely not, because I should be merely repeating your own
   meaning; for words do not belong more to the speaker of them than to
   him who called them forth.  As, then, in this case, I should have been
   looking, not so much at the terms used, as at the thoughts they were
   meant to convey; so neither, if I found something else either not at
   all or not clearly expressed in the Words of Scripture to be included
   in the meaning, should I avoid giving it utterance, out of fear of your
   sophistical trick about terms.  In this way, then, we shall hold our
   own against the semi-orthodox--among whom I may not count you.  For
   since you deny the Titles of the Son, which are so many and so clear,
   it is quite evident that even if you learnt a great many more and
   clearer ones you would not be moved to reverence.  But now I will take
   up the argument again a little way further back, and shew you, though
   you are so clever, the reason for this entire system of secresy.

   XXV.  There have been in the whole period of the duration of the world
   two conspicuous changes of men's lives, which are also called two
   Testaments, [3728] or, on account of the wide fame of the matter, two
   Earthquakes; the one from idols to the Law, the other from the Law to
   the Gospel.  And we are taught in the Gospel of a third earthquake,
   namely, from this Earth to that which cannot be shaken or moved. [3729]
     Now the two Testaments are alike in this respect, that the change was
   not made on a sudden, nor at the first movement of the endeavour.  Why
   not (for this is a point on which we must have information)?  That no
   violence might be done to us, but that we might be moved by
   persuasion.  For nothing that is involuntary is durable; like streams
   or trees which are kept back by force.  But that which is voluntary is
   more durable and safe.  The former is due to one who uses force, the
   latter is ours; the one is due to the gentleness of God, the other to a
   tyrannical authority.  Wherefore God did not think it behoved Him to
   benefit the unwilling, but to do good to the willing.  And therefore
   like a Tutor or Physician He partly removes and partly condones
   ancestral habits, conceding some little of what tended to pleasure,
   just as medical men do with their patients, that their medicine may be
   taken, being artfully blended with what is nice.  For it is no very
   easy matter to change from those habits which custom and use have made
   honourable.  For instance, the first cut off the idol, but left the
   sacrifices; the second, while it destroyed the sacrifices did not
   forbid circumcision. [3730]   Then, when once men had submitted to the
   curtailment, they also yielded that which had been conceded to them;
   [3731] in the first instance the sacrifices, in the second
   circumcision; and became instead of Gentiles, Jews, and instead of
   Jews, Christians, being beguiled into the Gospel by gradual changes.
   Paul is a proof of this; for having at one time administered
   circumcision, and submitted to legal purification, he advanced till he
   could say, and I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
   suffer persecution? [3732]   His former conduct belonged to the
   temporary dispensation, his latter to maturity.

   XXVI.  To this I may compare the case of Theology [3733] except that it
   proceeds the reverse way.  For in the case by which I have illustrated
   it the change is made by successive subtractions; whereas here
   perfection is reached by additions.  For the matter stands thus.  The
   Old Testament proclaimed the Father openly, and the Son more
   obscurely.  The New manifested the Son, and suggested the Deity of the
   Spirit.  Now the Spirit Himself dwells among us, and supplies us with a
   clearer demonstration of Himself.  For it was not safe, when the
   Godhead of the Father was not yet acknowledged, plainly to proclaim the
   Son; nor when that of the Son was not yet received to burden us further
   (if I may use so bold an expression) with the Holy Ghost; lest perhaps
   people might, like men loaded with food beyond their strength, and
   presenting eyes as yet too weak to bear it to the sun's light, risk the
   loss even of that which was within the reach of their powers; but that
   by gradual additions, and, as David says, Goings up, and advances and
   progress from glory to glory, [3734] the Light of the Trinity might
   shine upon the more illuminated.  For this reason it was, I think, that
   He gradually came to dwell in the Disciples, measuring Himself out to
   them according to their capacity to receive Him, at the beginning of
   the Gospel, after the Passion, after the Ascension, making perfect
   their powers, being breathed upon them, and appearing in fiery
   tongues.  And indeed it is by little and little that He is declared by
   Jesus, as you will learn for yourself if you will read more carefully.
   I will ask the Father, He says, and He will send you another Comforter,
   even the spirit of Truth. [3735]   This He said that He might not seem
   to be a rival God, or to make His discourses to them by another
   authority.  Again, He shall send Him, but it is in My Name.  He leaves
   out the I will ask, but He keeps the Shall send, [3736] then again, I
   will send,--His own dignity.  Then shall come, [3737] the authority of
   the Spirit.

   XXVII.  You see lights breaking upon us, gradually; and the order of
   Theology, which it is better for us to keep, neither proclaiming things
   too suddenly, nor yet keeping them hidden to the end.  For the former
   course would be unscientific, the latter atheistical; and the former
   would be calculated to startle outsiders, the latter to alienate our
   own people.  I will add another point to what I have said; one which
   may readily have come into the mind of some others, but which I think a
   fruit of my own thought.  Our Saviour had some things which, He said,
   could not be borne at that time by His disciples [3738] (though they
   were filled with many teachings), perhaps for the reasons I have
   mentioned; and therefore they were hidden.  And again He said that all
   things should be taught us by the Spirit when He should come to dwell
   amongst us. [3739]   Of these things one, I take it, was the Deity of
   the Spirit Himself, made clear later on when such knowledge should be
   seasonable and capable of being received after our Saviour's
   restoration, when it would no longer be received with incredulity
   because of its marvellous character.  For what greater thing than this
   did either He promise, or the Spirit teach.  If indeed anything is to
   be considered great and worthy of the Majesty of God, which was either
   promised or taught.

   XXVIII.  This, then, is my position with regard to these things, and I
   hope it may be always my position, and that of whosoever is dear to me;
   to worship God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, Three
   Persons, One Godhead, undivided in honour and glory and substance and
   kingdom, as one of our own inspired philosophers [3740] not long
   departed shewed.  Let him not see the rising of the Morning Star, as
   Scripture saith, [3741] nor the glory of its brightness, who is
   otherwise minded, or who follows the temper of the times, at one time
   being of one mind and of another at another time, and thinking
   unsoundly in the highest matters.  For if He is not to be worshipped,
   how can He deify me by Baptism? but if He is to be worshipped, surely
   He is an Object of adoration, and if an Object of adoration He must be
   God; the one is linked to the other, a truly golden and saving chain.
   And indeed from the Spirit comes our New Birth, and from the New Birth
   our new creation, and from the new creation our deeper knowledge of the
   dignity of Him from Whom it is derived.

   XXIX.  This, then, is what may be said by one who admits the silence of
   Scripture.  But now the swarm of testimonies shall burst upon you from
   which the Deity of the Holy Ghost [3742] shall be shewn to all who are
   not excessively stupid, or else altogether enemies to the Spirit, to be
   most clearly recognized in Scripture.  Look at these facts:--Christ is
   born; the Spirit is His Forerunner.  He is baptized; the Spirit bears
   witness.  He is tempted; the Spirit leads Him up. [3743]   He works
   miracles; the Spirit accompanies them.  He ascends; the Spirit takes
   His place.  What great things are there in the idea of God which are
   not in His power? [3744]   What titles which belong to God are not
   applied to Him, except only Unbegotten and Begotten?  For it was
   needful that the distinctive properties of the Father and the Son
   should remain peculiar to Them, lest there should be confusion in the
   Godhead Which brings all things, even disorder [3745] itself, into due
   arrangement and good order.  Indeed I tremble when I think of the
   abundance of the titles, and how many Names they outrage who fall foul
   of the Spirit.  He is called the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ,
   the Mind of Christ, the Spirit of The Lord, and Himself The Lord, the
   Spirit of Adoption, of Truth, of Liberty; the Spirit of Wisdom, of
   Understanding, of Counsel, of Might, of Knowledge, of Godliness, of the
   Fear of God.  For He is the Maker of all these, filling all with His
   Essence, containing all things, filling the world in His Essence, yet
   incapable of being comprehended in His power by the world; good,
   upright, princely, by nature not by adoption; sanctifying, not
   sanctified; measuring, not measured; shared, not sharing; filling, not
   filled; containing, not contained; inherited, glorified, reckoned with
   the Father and the Son; held out as a threat; [3746] the Finger of God;
   fire like God; to manifest, as I take it, His consubstantiality); the
   Creator-Spirit, Who by Baptism and by Resurrection creates anew; the
   Spirit That knoweth all things, That teacheth, That bloweth where and
   to what extent He listeth; That guideth, talketh, sendeth forth,
   separateth, is angry or tempted; That revealeth, illumineth,
   quickeneth, or rather is the very Light and Life; That maketh Temples;
   That deifieth; That perfecteth so as even to anticipate Baptism, [3747]
   yet after Baptism to be sought as a separate gift; [3748] That doeth
   all things that God doeth; divided into fiery tongues; dividing gifts;
   making Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers;
   understanding manifold, clear, piercing, undefiled, unhindered, which
   is the same thing as Most wise and varied in His actions; and making
   all things clear and plain; and of independent power, unchangeable,
   Almighty, all-seeing, penetrating all spirits that are intelligent,
   pure, most subtle (the Angel Hosts I think); and also all prophetic
   spirits and apostolic in the same manner and not in the same places;
   for they lived in different places; thus showing that He is
   uncircumscript.

   XXX.  They who say and teach these things, and moreover call Him
   another Paraclete in the sense of another God, who know that blasphemy
   against Him alone cannot be forgiven, [3749] and who branded with such
   fearful infamy Ananias and Sapphira for having lied to the Holy Ghost,
   what do you think of these men? [3750]   Do they proclaim the Spirit
   God, or something else?  Now really, you must be extraordinarily dull
   and far from the Spirit if you have any doubt about this and need some
   one to teach you.  So important then, and so vivid are His Names.  Why
   is it necessary to lay before you the testimony contained in the very
   words?  And whatever in this case also [3751] is said in more lowly
   fashion, as that He is Given, Sent, Divided; that He is the Gift, the
   Bounty, the Inspiration, the Promise, the Intercession for us, and, not
   to go into any further detail, any other expressions of the sort, is to
   be referred to the First Cause, that it may be shewn from Whom He is,
   and that men may not in heathen fashion admit Three Principles.  For it
   is equally impious to confuse the Persons with the Sabellians, or to
   divide the Natures with the Arians.

   XXXI.  I have very carefully considered this matter in my own mind, and
   have looked at it in every point of view, in order to find some
   illustration of this most important subject, but I have been unable to
   discover any thing on earth with which to compare the nature of the
   Godhead.  For even if I did happen upon some tiny likeness it escaped
   me for the most part, and left me down below with my example.  I
   picture to myself an eye, [3752] a fountain, a river, as others have
   done before, to see if the first might be analogous to the Father, the
   second to the Son, and the third to the Holy Ghost.  For in these there
   is no distinction in time, nor are they torn away from their connexion
   with each other, though they seem to be parted by three personalities.
   But I was afraid in the first place that I should present a flow in the
   Godhead, incapable of standing still; and secondly that by this figure
   a numerical unity would be introduced.  For the eye and the spring and
   the river are numerically one, though in different forms.

   XXXII.  Again I thought of the sun and a ray and light.  But here again
   there was a fear lest people should get an idea of composition in the
   Uncompounded Nature, such as there is in the Sun and the things that
   are in the Sun.  And in the second place lest we should give Essence to
   the Father but deny Personality to the Others, and make Them only
   Powers of God, existing in Him and not Personal.  For neither the ray
   nor the light is another sun, but they are only effulgences from the
   Sun, and qualities of His essence.  And lest we should thus, as far as
   the illustration goes, attribute both Being and Not-being to God, which
   is even more monstrous.  I have also heard that some one has suggested
   an illustration of the following kind.  A ray of the Sun flashing upon
   a wall and trembling with the movement of the moisture which the beam
   has taken up in mid air, and then, being checked by the hard body, has
   set up a strange quivering.  For it quivers with many rapid movements,
   and is not one rather than it is many, nor yet many rather than one;
   because by the swiftness of its union and separating it escapes before
   the eye can see it.

   XXXIII.  But it is not possible for me to make use of even this;
   because it is very evident what gives the ray its motion; but there is
   nothing prior to God which could set Him in motion; for He is Himself
   the Cause of all things, and He has no prior Cause.  And secondly
   because in this case also there is a suggestion of such things as
   composition, diffusion, and an unsettled and unstable nature...none of
   which we can suppose in the Godhead.  In a word, there is nothing which
   presents a standing point to my mind in these illustrations from which
   to consider the Object which I am trying to represent to myself, unless
   one may indulgently accept one point of the image while rejecting the
   rest.  Finally, then, it seems best to me to let the images and the
   shadows go, as being deceitful and very far short of the truth; and
   clinging myself to the more reverent conception, and resting upon few
   words, using the guidance of the Holy Ghost, keeping to the end as my
   genuine comrade and companion the enlightenment which I have received
   from Him, and passing through this world to persuade all others also to
   the best of my power to worship Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the One
   Godhead and Power.  To Him belongs all glory and honour and might for
   ever and ever.  Amen.

   evidently meaning Marcus; for the system of Marcion is characterized by
   an entire absence of any theory of Emanations (Æons).  Similarly there

   [3709] Sabellius, who taught at Rome during the Pontificate of
   Callistus, was by far the most important heresiarch of his period, and
   his opinions by far the most dangerous.  While strongly emphasizing the
   fundamental doctrine of the Divine Unity, he also admitted in terms a
   Trinity, but his Trinity was not that of the Catholic dogma, for he
   represented it as only a threefold manifestation of the one Divine
   Essence.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are in his view only
   temporary phænomena, which fulfil their mission, and then return into
   the abstract Monad.  Dr. Schaff (Hist. of the Church, Ante-Nicene
   Period, p. 582) gives the following concise account of his teaching:
   "The unity of God, without distinction in itself, unfolds or extends
   itself in the course of the word's development in three different forms
   and periods of revelation, and after the completion of redemption
   returns into Unity.  The Father reveals Himself in the giving of the
   Law or the Old Testament Economy (not in the creation also, which in
   his view precedes the Trinitarian revelation); the Son in the
   Incarnation; the Holy Ghost in inspiration; the revelation of the Son
   ends with the Ascension; that of the Spirit goes on in generation and
   sanctification.  He illustrates the Trinitarian revelation by comparing
   the Father to the disc of the sun, the Son to its enlightening power,
   the Spirit to its warming influence.  He is also said to have likened
   the Father to the body, the Son to the soul, the Holy Ghost to the
   spirit of man:  but this is unworthy of his evident speculative
   discrimination.  His view of the Logos too is peculiar.  The Logos is
   not identical with the Son, but is the Monad itself in its transition
   to Triad; that is, God conceived as vital motion and creating
   principle; the Speaking God, as distinguished from the Silent God.
   Each Person (or Aspect--the word is ambiguous) is another Uttering; and
   the Three Persons together are only successive evolutions of the Logos,
   or world-ward aspect of the Divine Nature.  As the Logos proceeded from
   God, so He at last returns into Him, and the process of Trinitarian
   development closes."

   have been thought to be cited by S. Cyprian in his work on the Unity of
   the Church; and this citation, if a fact, would be a most important
   one, as it would throw back their reception to an early date.  But

   [3740] Perhaps S. Gregory Thaumaturgus is meant.  He was born about
   a.d. 210.  The date of his death is uncertain, but was probably not
   before 270.  He was Bishop of Neocæsarea in Pontus.  Amongst his works
   was an Exposition of the Faith, which he is said to have received by
   direct revelation, and in it the words in the text were contained.  S.
   Gregory in another Oration refers to the closing sentences as the
   substance of the Formula itself:  "There is nothing created or servile
   in the Trinity, nor anything superinduced, as though previously
   non-existing and introduced afterwards.  Never therefore, was the Son

   Oration XXXIII.

   Against The Arians, and Concerning Himself.

   Delivered at Constantinople about the middle of the year 380.

   I.  Where are they who reproach us with our poverty, and boast
   themselves of their own riches; who define the Church by numbers,
   [3753] and scorn the little flock; and who measure Godhead, [3754] and
   weigh the people in the balance, who honour the sand, and despise the
   luminaries of heaven; who treasure pebbles and overlook pearls; for
   they know not that sand is not in a greater degree more abundant than
   stars, and pebbles than lustrous stones--that the former are purer and
   more precious than the latter?  Are you again indignant?  Do you again
   arm yourselves?  Do you again insult us? [3755]   Is this a new faith?
   Restrain your threats a little while that I may speak.  We will not
   insult you, but we will convict you; we will not threaten, but we will
   reproach you; we will not strike, but we will heal.  This too appears
   an insult!  What pride!  Do you here also regard your equal as your
   slave?  If not, permit me to speak openly; for even a brother chides
   his brother if he has been defrauded by him.

   II.  Would you like me to utter to you the words of God to Israel,
   stiff-necked and hardened?  "O my people what have I done unto thee, or
   wherein have I injured thee, or wherein have I wearied thee?" [3756]
   This language indeed is fitter from me to you who insult me.  It is a
   sad thing that we watch for opportunities against each other, and
   having destroyed our fellowship of spirit by diversities of opinion
   have become almost more inhuman and savage to one another than even the
   barbarians who are now engaged in war against us, banded together
   against us by the Trinity whom we have separated; with this difference
   that we are not foreigners making forays and raids upon foreigners, nor
   nations of different language, which is some little consolation in the
   calamity, but are making war upon one another, and almost upon those of
   the same household; or if you will, we the members of the same body are
   consuming and being consumed by one another.  Nor is this, bad though
   it be, the extent of our calamity, for we even regard our diminution as
   a gain.  But since we are in such a condition, and regulate our faith
   by the times, let us compare the times with one another; you your
   Emperor, [3757] and I my Sovereigns; [3758] you Ahab and I Josias.
   Tell me of your moderation, and I will proclaim my violence.  But
   indeed yours is proclaimed by many books and tongues, which I think
   future ages will accept as an immortal pillory for your actions and I
   will declare my own.

   III.  What tumultuous mob have I led against you?  What soldiers have I
   armed?  What general boiling with rage, and more savage than his
   employers, and not even a Christian, but one who offers his impiety
   against us as his private worship to his own gods? [3759]   Whom have I
   besieged while engaged in prayer and lifting up their hands to God?
   When have I put a stop to psalmody with trumpets? or mingled the
   Sacramental Blood with blood of massacre?  What spiritual sighs have I
   put an end to by cries of death, or tears of penitence by tears of
   tragedy?  What House of prayer have I made a burialplace?  What
   liturgical vessels which the multitude may not touch have I given over
   to the hands of the wicked, of a Nebuzaradan, [3760] chief of the
   cooks, or of a Belshazzar, who wickedly used the sacred vessels for his
   revels, [3761] and then paid a worthy penalty for his madness?  "Altars
   beloved" as Holy Scripture saith, but "now defiled." [3762]   And what
   licentious youth has insulted you for our sake with shameful writhings
   and contortions?  O precious Throne, seat and rest of precious men,
   which hast been occupied by a succession of pious Priests, who from
   ancient times have taught the divine Mysteries, what heathen popular
   speaker and evil tongue hath mounted thee to inveigh against the
   Christian's faith?  O modesty and majesty of Virgins, that cannot
   endure the looks of even virtuous men, which of us hath shamed thee,
   and outraged thee by the exposure of what may not be seen, and showed
   to the eyes of the impious a pitiable sight, worthy of the fires of
   Sodom?  I say nothing of deaths, which were more endurable than this
   shame.

   IV.  What wild beasts have we let loose upon the bodies of
   Saints,--like some who have prostituted human nature,--on one single
   accusation, that of not consenting to their impiety; or defiled
   ourselves by communion with them, which we avoid like the poison of a
   snake, not because it injures the body, but because it blackens the
   depths of the soul?  Against whom have we made it a matter of criminal
   accusation that they buried the dead, whom the very beasts reverenced?
   And what a charge, worthy of another theatre and of other beasts!  What
   Bishop's aged flesh have we carded with hooks in the presence of their
   disciples, impotent to help them save by tears, hung up with Christ,
   conquering by suffering, and sprinkling the people with their precious
   blood, and at last carried away to death, to be both crucified and
   buried and glorified with Christ; with Christ Who conquered the world
   by such victims and sacrifices?  What priests have those contrary
   elements fire and water divided, raising a strange beacon over the sea,
   and set on fire together with the ship in which they put to sea? [3763]
     Who (to cover the more numerous part of our woes with a veil of
   silence) have been accused of inhumanity by the very magistrates who
   conferred such favour on them?  For even if they did obey the lusts of
   those men, yet at any rate they hated the cruelty of their purpose.
   The one was opportunism, the other calculation; the one came of the
   lawlessness of the Emperor, the other of a consciousness of the laws by
   which they had to judge.

   V.  And to speak of older things, for they too belong to the same
   fraternity; whose hands living or dead have I cut off--to bring a lying
   accusation against Saints, [3764] and to triumph over the faith by
   bluster?  Whose exiles have I numbered as benefits, and failed to
   reverence even the sacred colleges of sacred philosophers, whence I
   sought their suppliants?  Nay the very contrary is the case; I have
   reckoned as Martyrs those who incurred anger for the truth.  Upon whom
   have I, whom you accuse of licentiousness of language, brought harlots
   when they were almost fleshless and bloodless?  Which of the faithful
   have I exiled from their country and given over to the hands of lawless
   men, that they might be kept like wild beasts in rooms without light,
   and (for this is the saddest part of the tragedy) left separated from
   each other to endure the hardships of hunger and thirst, with food
   measured out to them, which they had to receive through narrow
   openings, so that they might not be permitted even to see their
   companions in misery.  And what were they who suffered thus?  Men of
   whom the world was not worthy. [3765]   Is it thus that you honour
   faith?  Is this your kind treatment of it?  Ye know not the greater
   part of these things, and that reasonably, because of the number of
   these facts and the pleasure of the action.  But he who suffers has a
   better memory.  There have been even some more cruel than the times
   themselves, like wild boars hurled against a fence.  I demand your
   victim of yesterday [3766] the old man, the Abraham-like Father, whom
   on his return from exile you greeted with stones in the middle of the
   day and in the middle of the city.  But we, if it is not invidious to
   say so, begged off even our murderers from their danger.  God says
   somewhere in Scripture, How shall I pardon thee for this? [3767]
   Which of these things shall I praise; or rather for which shall I bind
   a wreath upon you?

   VI.  Now since your antecedents are such, I should be glad if you too
   will tell me of my crimes, that I may either amend my life or be put to
   shame.  My greatest wish is that I may be found free from wrong
   altogether; but if this may not be, at least to be converted from my
   crime; for this is the second best portion of the prudent.  For if like
   the just man I do not become my own accuser in the first instance,
   [3768] yet at any rate I gladly receive healing from another.  "Your
   City, you say to me, is a little one, or rather is no city at all, but
   only a village, arid, without beauty, and with few inhabitants."  But,
   my good friend, this is my misfortune, rather than my fault;--if indeed
   it be a misfortune; and if it is against my will, I am to be pitied for
   my bad luck, if I may put it so; but if it be willingly, I am a
   philosopher.  Which of these is a crime?  Would anyone abuse a dolphin
   for not being a land animal, or an ox because it is not aquatic, or a
   lamprey because it is amphibious?  But we, you go on, have walls and
   theatres and racecourses and palaces, and beautiful great Porticoes,
   and that marvellous work the underground and overhead river, [3769] and
   the splendid and admired column, [3770] and the crowded marketplace and
   a restless people, and a famous senate of highborn men.

   VII.  Why do you not also mention the convenience of the site, and what
   I may call the contest between land and sea as to which owns the City,
   and which adorns our Royal City with all their good things?  This then
   is our crime, that while you are great and splendid, we are small and
   come from a small place?  Many others do you this wrong, indeed all
   those whom you excel; and must we die because we have not reared a
   city, nor built walls around it, nor can boast of our racecourse, or
   our stadia, and pack of hounds, and all the follies that are connected
   with these things; nor have to boast of the beauty and splendour of our
   baths, and the costliness of their marbles and pictures and golden
   embroideries of all sorts of species, almost rivalling nature?  Nor
   have we yet rounded off the sea for ourselves, or mingled the seasons,
   as of course you, the new Creators, have done, that we may live in what
   is at once the pleasantest and the safest way.  Add if you like other
   charges, you who say, The silver is mine and the gold is mine, [3771]
   those words of God.  We neither think much of riches, on which, if they
   increase, our Law forbids us to set our hearts, nor do we count up
   yearly and daily revenues; nor do we rival one another in loading our
   tables with enchantments for our senseless belly.  For neither do we
   highly esteem those things which after we have swallowed them are all
   of the same worth, or rather I should say worthlessness, and are
   rejected.  But we live so simply and from hand to mouth, as to differ
   but little from beasts whose sustenance is without apparatus and
   inartificial.

   VIII.  Do you also find fault with the raggedness of my dress, and the
   want of elegance in the disposition of my face? for these are the
   points upon which I see that some persons who are very insignificant
   pride themselves.  Will you leave my head alone, and not jeer at it, as
   the children did at Elissæus?  What followed I will not mention.  And
   will you leave out of your allegations my want of education, and what
   seems to you the roughness and rusticity of my elocution?  And where
   will you put the fact that I am not full of small talk, nor a jester
   popular with company, nor great hunter of the marketplace, nor given to
   chatter and gossip with any chance people upon all sorts of subjects,
   so as to make even conversation grievous; nor a frequenter of
   Zeuxippus, that new Jerusalem; [3772] nor one who strolls from house to
   house flattering and stuffing himself; but for the most part staying at
   home, of low spirits and with a melancholy cast of countenance, quietly
   associating with myself, the genuine critic of my actions; and perhaps
   worthy of imprisonment for my uselessness?  How is it that you pardon
   me for all this, and do not blame me for it?  How sweet and kind you
   are.

   IX.  But I am so old fashioned and such a philosopher as to believe
   that one heaven is common to all; and that so is the revolution of the
   sun and the moon, and the order and arrangement of the stars; and that
   all have in Common an equal share and profit in day and night, and also
   change of seasons, rains, fruits, and quickening power of the air; and
   that the flowing rivers are a common and abundant wealth to all; and
   that one and the same is the Earth, the mother and the tomb, from which
   we were taken, and to which we shall return, none having a greater
   share than another.  And further, above this, we have in common reason,
   the Law, the Prophets, the very Sufferings of Christ, by which we were
   all without exception created anew, who partake of the same Adam, and
   were led astray by the serpent and slain by sin, and are saved by the
   heavenly Adam and brought back by the tree of shame to the tree of life
   from whence we had fallen.

   X.  I was deceived too by the Ramah of Samuel, that little fatherland
   of the great man; which was no dishonour to the Prophet, for it drew
   its honour not so much from itself as from him; nor was he hindered on
   its account from being given to God before his birth, or from uttering
   oracles, and foreseeing the future; nor only so, but also anointing
   Kings and Priests, and judging the men of illustrious cities.  I heard
   also of Saul, how while seeking his father's asses he found a kingdom.
   And even David himself was taken from the sheepfolds to be the shepherd
   of Israel.  What of Amos?  Was he not, while a goatherd and scraper of
   sycamore fruit entrusted with the gifts of prophecy?  How is it that I
   have passed over Joseph, who was both a slave and the giver of corn to
   Egypt, and the father of many myriads who were promised before to
   Abraham?  Aye and I was deceived by the Carmel of Elias, who received
   the car of fire; and by the sheepskin of Elissæus that had more power
   than a silken web or than gold forced into garments.  I was deceived by
   the desert of John, which held the greatest among them that are born of
   women, with that clothing, that food, that girdle, which we know.  And
   I ventured even beyond these, and found God Himself the Patron of my
   rusticity.  I will range myself with Bethlehem, and will share the
   ignominy of the Manger; for since you refuse on this account honour to
   God, it is no wonder that on the same account you despise His herald
   also.  And I will bring up to you the Fishermen, and the poor to whom
   the Gospel is preached, as preferred before many rich.  Will you ever
   leave off priding yourselves upon your cities?  Will you ever revere
   that wilderness which you abominate and despise?  I do not yet say that
   gold has its birthplace in sand; nor that translucent stones are the
   product and gifts of rocks; for if to these I should oppose all that is
   dishonourable in cities perhaps it would be to no good end that I
   should use my freedom of speech.

   XI.  But perhaps some one who is very circumscribed and carnally minded
   will say, "But our herald is a stranger and a foreigner."  What of the
   Apostles?  Were not they strangers to the many nations and cities among
   whom they were divided, that the Gospel might have free course
   everywhere, that nothing might miss the illumination of the Threefold
   Light, or be unenlightened by the Truth; but that the night of
   ignorance might be dissolved for those who sat in darkness and the
   shadow of death?  You have heard the words of Paul, "that we might go
   the Gentiles, and they to the Circumcision." [3773]   Be it that Judæa
   is Peter's home; what has Paul in common with the Gentiles, Luke with
   Achaia, Andrew with Epirus, John with Ephesus, Thomas with India, Marc
   with Italy, or the rest, not to go into particulars, with those to whom
   they went?  So that you must either blame them or excuse me, or else
   prove that you, the ambassadors of the true Gospel, are being insulted
   by trifling.  But since I have argued with you in a petty way about
   these matters, I will now proceed to take a larger and more philosophic
   view of them.

   XII.  My friend, every one that is of high mind has one Country, the
   Heavenly Jerusalem, in which we store up our Citizenship.  All have one
   family--if you look at what is here below the dust--or if you look
   higher, that Inbreathing of which we are partakers, and which we were
   bidden to keep, and with which I must stand before my Judge to give an
   account of my heavenly nobility, and of the Divine Image.  Everyone
   then is noble who has guarded this through virtue and consent to his
   Archetype.  On the other hand, everyone is ignoble who has mingled with
   evil, and put upon himself another form, that of the serpent.  And
   these earthly countries and families are the playthings of this our
   temporary life and scene.  For our country is whatever each may have
   first occupied, either as tyrant, or in misfortune; and in this we are
   all alike strangers and pilgrims, however much we may play with names.
   And the family is accounted noble which is either rich from old days,
   or is recently raised; and of ignoble birth that which is of poor
   parents, either owing to misfortune or to want of ambition.  For how
   can a nobility be given from above which is at one time beginning and
   at another coming to an end; and which is not given to some, but is
   bestowed on others by letters patent?  Such is my mind on this matter.
   Therefore I leave it to you to pride yourself on tombs or in myths, and
   I endeavour as far as I can, to purify myself from deceits, that I may
   keep if possible my nobility, or else may recover it.

   XIII.  It is thus then and for these reasons that I, who am small and
   of a country without repute, have come upon you, and that not of my own
   accord, nor self-sent, like many of those who now seize upon the chief
   places; but because I was invited, and compelled, and have followed the
   scruples of my conscience and the Call of the Spirit.  If it be
   otherwise, may I continue to fight here to no purpose, and deliver no
   one from his error, but may they obtain their desire who seek the
   barrenness of my soul, if I lie.  But since I am come, and perchance
   with no contemptible power (if I may boast myself a little of my
   folly), which of those who are insatiable have I copied, what have I
   emulated of opportunism, although I have such examples, even apart from
   which it is hard and rare not to be bad?  Concerning what churches or
   property have I disputed with you; though you have more than enough of
   both, and the others too little?  What imperial edict have we rejected
   and emulated?  What rulers have we fawned upon against you?  Whose
   boldness have we denounced?  And what has been done on the other side
   against me?  "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge," even then I
   said, for I remembered in season the words of Stephen, [3774] and so I
   pray now.  Being reviled, we bless:  being blasphemed we retreat.
   [3775]

   XIV.  And if I am doing wrong in this, that when tyrannized over I
   endure it, forgive me this wrong; I have borne to be tyrannized over by
   others too; and I am thankful that my moderation has brought upon me
   the charge of folly.  For I reckon thus, using considerations
   altogether higher than any of yours; what a mere fraction are these
   trials of the spittings and blows which Christ, for Whom and by Whose
   aid we encounter these dangers, endured.  I do not count them, taken
   altogether, worth the one crown of thorns which robbed our conqueror of
   his crown, for whose sake also I learn that I am crowned for the
   hardness of life.  I do not reckon them worth the one reed by which the
   rotten empire was destroyed; of the gall alone, the vinegar alone, by
   which we were cured of the bitter taste; of the gentleness alone which
   He shewed in His Passion.  Was He betrayed with a kiss?  He reproves
   with a kiss, but smites not.  Is he suddenly arrested?  He reproaches
   indeed, but follows; and if through zeal thou cuttest off the ear of
   Malchus with the sword, He will be angry, and will restore it.  And if
   one flee in a linen sheet, [3776] he will defend him.  And if you ask
   for the fire of Sodom upon his captors, he will not pour it forth; and
   if he take a thief hanging upon the cross for his crime he will bring
   him into Paradise through His Goodness.  Let all the acts of one that
   loves men be loving, as were all the sufferings of Christ, to which we
   could add nothing greater than, when God even died for us, to refuse on
   our part to forgive even the smallest wrongs of our fellowmen.

   XV.  Moreover this also I reckoned and still reckon with myself; and do
   you see if it is not quite correct.  I have often discussed it with you
   before.  These men have the houses, but we the Dweller in the house;
   they the Temples, we the God; and besides it is ours to be living
   temples of the Living God, lively sacrifices, reasonable
   burnt-offerings, perfect sacrifices, yea, gods through the adoration of
   the Trinity.  They have the people, we the Angels; they rash boldness,
   we faith; they threatenings, we prayer; they smiting, we endurance;
   they gold and silver, we the pure word.  "Thou hast built for thyself a
   wide house and large chambers (recognize the words of Scripture), a
   house celled and pierced with windows." [3777]   But not yet is this
   loftier than my faith, and than the heavens to which I am being borne
   onwards.  Is mine a little flock?  But it is not being carried over a
   precipice.  Is mine a narrow fold?  But it is unapproachable by wolves;
   it cannot be entered by a robber, nor climbed by thieves and
   strangers.  I shall yet see it, I know well, wider.  And many of those
   who are now wolves, I must reckon among my sheep, and perhaps even
   amongst the shepherds.  This is the glad tidings brought me by the Good
   Shepherd, for Whose sake I lay down my life for the sheep.  I fear not
   for the little flock; for it is seen at a glance.  I know my sheep and
   am known of mine.  Such are they that know God and are known of God.
   My sheep hear my voice, which I have heard from the oracles of God,
   which I have been taught by the Holy Fathers, which I have taught alike
   on all occasions, not conforming myself to the fortune, and which I
   will never cease to teach; in which I was born, and in which I will
   depart.

   XVI.  These I call by name (for they are not nameless like the stars
   which are numbered and have names), [3778] and they follow me, for I
   rear them up beside the waters of rest; and they follow every such
   shepherd, whose voice they love to hear, as you see; but a stranger
   they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they have a habit
   of distinguishing the voice of their own from that of strangers.  They
   will flee from Valentinus [3779] with his division of one into two,
   refusing to believe that the Creator is other than the Good.  They will
   flee from Depth and Silence, and the mythical Æons, that are verily
   worthy of Depth and Silence.  They will flee from Marcion's [3780] god,
   compounded of elements and numbers; from Montanus' [3781] evil and
   feminine spirit; from the matter and darkness of Manes; [3782] from
   Novatus' [3783] boasting and wordy assumption of purity; from the
   analysis and confusion of Sabellius, [3784] and if I may use the
   expression, his absorption, contracting the Three into One, instead of
   defining the One in Three Personalities; from the difference of natures
   taught by Arius [3785] and his followers, and their new Judaism,
   confining the Godhead to the Unbegotten; from Photinus [3786] earthly
   Christ, who took his beginning from Mary.  But they worship the Father
   and the Son and the Holy Ghost, One Godhead; God the Father, God the
   Son and (do not be angry) God the Holy Ghost, One Nature in Three
   Personalities, intellectual, perfect, Self-existent, numerically
   separate, but not separate in Godhead.

   XVII.  These words let everyone who threatens me to-day concede to me;
   the rest let whoever will claim.  The Father will not endure to be
   deprived of the Son, nor the Son of the Holy Ghost.  Yet that must
   happen if They are confined to time, and are created Beings...for that
   which is created is not God.  Neither will I bear to be deprived of my
   consecration; One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism.  If this be cancelled,
   from whom shall I get a second?  What say you, you who destroy Baptism
   or repeat it?  Can a man be spiritual without the Spirit?  Has he a
   share in the Spirit who does not honour the Spirit?  Can he honour Him
   who is baptized into a creature and a fellow-servant?  It is not so; it
   is not so; for all your talk.  I will not play Thee false, O
   Unoriginate Father, or Thee O Only-begotten Word, or Thee O Holy
   Ghost.  I know Whom I have confessed, and whom I have renounced, and to
   Whom I have joined myself.  I will not allow myself, after having been
   taught the words of the faithful, to learn also those of the
   unfaithful; to confess the truth, and then range myself with falsehood;
   to come down for consecration and to go back even less hallowed; having
   been baptised that I might live, to be killed by the water, like
   infants who die in the very birthpangs, and receive death
   simultaneously with birth.  Why make me at once blessed and wretched,
   newly enlightened and unenlightened, Divine and godless, that I may
   make shipwreck even of the hope of regeneration?  A few words will
   suffice.  Remember your confession.  Into what were you baptised?  The
   Father?  Good but Jewish still.  The Son?...good...but not yet
   perfect.  The Holy Ghost?...Very good...this is perfect.  Now was it
   into these simply, or some common name of Them?  The latter.  And what
   was the common Name?  Why, God.  In this common Name believe, and ride
   on prosperously and reign, [3787] and pass on from hence into the Bliss
   of Heaven.  And that is, as I think, the more distinct apprehension of
   These; to which may we all come, in the same Christ our God, to Whom be
   the glory and the might, with the Unoriginate Father, and the
   Lifegiving Spirit, now and for ever and to ages of ages.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3753] Shewing the absurdity of defining the Church by counting heads.

   [3754] This refers to the distinction drawn by the Arians in degree as
   to the Godhead, asserting the Spirit to be great, the Son greater, and
   the Father greatest (cf. Or. xlii., 16).

   [3755] The beginning of the Oration was apparently disturbed by hostile
   demonstrations on the part of Arian hearers.

   [3757] Valens.

   [3758] Theodosius and Gratian.

   [3759] Dr. Ullmann makes this passage refer to outrages perpetrated in
   Constantinople itself on Gregory, by his Arian opponents.  On one
   occasion, he says, in the night time the meetingplace of the Orthodox
   was assailed; a mob of Arians, and in particular women of the lowest
   stamp, set on by monks, armed themselves with sticks and stones, and
   forced an entrance into the peaceful place of holy worship.  The
   champion of orthodoxy well nigh became a martyr to his convictions; the
   Altar was profaned, the consecrated wine was mixed with blood; the
   house of prayer was made a scene of outrage and unbridled
   licentiousness.  The Benedictine Editors, however, whom Benoit follows,
   think the reference is to the disturbances in Alexandria when the Arian
   Lucius was forcibly intruded into the Chair of Athanasius by the
   Prefect Palladius.  A full account of the atrocities by which his
   installation was marked is to be found in a letter of Peter, the
   expelled or orthodox Patriarch, preserved in Theodoret (H. E. IV. 22).
   This Lucius was living in Constantinople and abetting the Arian party
   there at the time when Gregory pronounced this Oration.

   [3763] Socrates (H. E. IV. 16) gives an account of the murder of eighty
   Priests by order of Valens.  The Prefect of Nicomedia, being afraid to
   execute the Emperor's commands by a public action, put these men on
   board a ship, as if to send them into exile, but gave orders to the
   crew to set the vessel on fire on the high seas, and leave the
   prisoners to their fate. Billius, however, thinks that the reference is
   to the martyrdom of a single Priest, whose death in this way is
   described by S. Gregory in his panegyric on Maximus (Or. xxv. 10, p.
   461, 462).

   [3764] S. Athanasius was accused by the Arians of having murdered a
   Meletian Bishop named Arsenius, and cut off his hand to use for magical
   purposes; and at a Synod held at Tyre in 334 they produced the alleged
   hand in a box.  Athanasius, however, was able to produce Arsenius alive
   and unmutilated; but even so his accusers were not satisfied.

   [3765] Heb. xi. 38.

   [3766] The reference is perhaps to Eusebius of Samosata, who was killed
   by a tile thrown at him by an Arian woman.  In dying he bound his
   friends by an oath not to allow the murderess to be punished.

   [3779] Valentinus, a celebrated Gnostic leader of the Second Century,
   was one of the first Gnostics who taught in Rome.  He was probably of
   Ægypto-Jewish descent, and was educated at Alexandria.  He died in
   Cyprus about 160.  His system is a very curious one, giving the reins
   to the wildest vagaries of the imagination.  The original eternal
   Being, or Absolute Existence, he called Bythos or Depth; and to this he
   assigned as a wife Sige or Silence.  From this union there sprang
   thirty Æons or Emanations, who unfolded the Attributes of the Deity and
   created the world.

   [3780] Marcion was a contemporary of Valentinus.  He was a native of
   Sinope in Pontus, of which city his father was Bishop.  He supposed
   Three Principles, the Good God, Who was first revealed by Christ; the
   Just Creator, Who is the "hot tempered and imperfect" God of the Jews;
   and the intrinsically evil Hyle or Matter, which is ruled by the
   Devil.  He also distinguished two Messiahs; one a mere warrior prince
   sent by the Jewish God to restore Israel; the other sent by the Good
   God for the delivery of the whole human race.

   [3781] Montanus, a Phrygian enthusiast of the middle of the Second
   Century, imagined himself the inspired Organ of the Paraclete.
   Connected with him were two Prophetesses, Priscilla and Maximilla, who
   left their husbands to follow him.  His heresy, or rather his schism,
   spread to Rome and Northern Africa, and threw the whole Church into
   confusion.  He was very early anathematized by Bishops and Synods of
   Asia, but he carried the great African, Tertullian, away by his frenzy.

   [3782] Manes or Mani, a Persia philosopher, astronomer, and painter of
   the Third Century, who introduced into Christianity some elements drawn
   from the religion of Zoroaster, especially its proton pseudos.
   Dualism, the co-eternity of two contradictory principles, Light and
   Darkness, Spirit and Matter, Good and Evil.  This heresy flourished
   till the Sixth Century, S. Augustine himself having been for nine years
   led away by it.  It is believed not to be wholly extinct even now in
   some parts of Eastern Christendom.

   [3783] Novatus was a Carthaginian Priest, who at first rebelled against
   his Bishop, S. Cyprian, on account of his severity in the treatment of
   persons who had lapsed in the Decian persecution.  At Rome, however,
   this same Novatus, either out of simple antagonism to constituted
   authority, or because he had really changed his views, adopted the
   extremest rigorism, and became one of the most violent partisans of the
   Priest Novatian, whom his followers contrived to get consecrated as a
   rival Bishop of Rome, in opposition to Cornelius, the reigning Pope.
   They set up a new "church," and arrogated to themselves an exclusive
   claim to the title of Cathari, the Pure.

   [3784] Sabellius, a native of the Libyan Pentapolis, rejected the
   Catholic Faith of the Trinity of Persons in God, and would only allow a
   Trinity of manifestations.

   [3785] It is hardly necessary here to dwell on the Arian tenets; cf.
   Prolegomena to the Theological Oration.

   [3786] Photinus was a n by birth, and flourished in the fourth century,
   a little earlier than S. Gregory.  He seems to have taught that our
   Lord Jesus Christ was a mere man, and had no existence previous to His
   Birth of the Virgin Mary.  He made Jesus rise on the basis of His human
   nature, by a course of moral improvement, to the divine dignity, so
   that the Divine in Him is a thing of growth:  cf. Schaff, H. E. Nicene
   Period, vol. ii. p. 653.

   [3787] Ps. xlv. 4.

   Oration XXXIV.

   On the Arrival of the Egyptians.

   This Oration was preached at Constantinople in 380, under the following
   circumstances:  Peter, Patriarch of Alexandria, had sent a mission of
   five of his Suffragans to consecrate the impostor Maximus to the Throne
   occupied by Gregory.  This had led to much trouble, but in the end the
   intruder had been expelled and banished.  Shortly afterwards an
   Egyptian fleet, probably the regular corn ships, had arrived at
   Constantinople, apparently on the day before a Festival.  The crews of
   the ships, landing next day to go to Church, passed by the numerous
   Churches held by the Arians, and betook themselves to the little
   Anastasia.  S. Gregory felt himself moved to congratulate them
   specially on such an act, after what had recently passed, and
   accordingly pronounced the following discourse.

   I.  I will address myself as is right to those who have come from
   Egypt; for they have come here eagerly, having overcome illwill by
   zeal, from that Egypt which is enriched by the River, raining out of
   the earth, and like the sea in its season,--if I too may follow in my
   small measure those who have so eloquently spoken of these matters; and
   which is also enriched by Christ my Lord, Who once was a fugitive into
   Egypt, and now is supplied by Egypt; the first, when He fled from
   Herod's massacre of the children; [3788] and now by the love of the
   fathers for their children, by Christ the new Food of those who hunger
   after good; [3789] the greatest alms of corn of which history speaks
   and men believe; the Bread which came down from heaven and giveth life
   to the world, that life which is indestructible and indissoluble,
   concerning Whom I now seem to hear the Father saying, Out of Egypt have
   I called My Son. [3790]

   II.  For from you hath sounded forth the Word to all men; healthfully
   believed and preached; and you are the best bringers of fruit of all
   men, specially of those who now hold the right faith, as far as I know,
   who am not only a lover of such food, but also its distributor, and not
   at home only but also abroad.  For you indeed supply bodily food to
   peoples and cities so far as your lovingkindness reaches; and you
   supply spiritual food also, not to a particular people, nor to this or
   that city, circumscribed by narrow boundaries, though its people may
   think it very illustrious, but to almost the whole world.  And you
   bring the remedy not for famine of bread or thirst of water, [3791]
   which is no very terrible famine--and to avoid it is easy; but to a
   famine of hearing the Word of the Lord, which it is most miserable to
   suffer, and a most laborious matter to cure at the present time,
   because iniquity hath abounded, [3792] and scarce anywhere do I find
   its genuine healers.

   III.  Such was Joseph your Superintendent of corn measures, whom I may
   call ours also; who by his surpassing wisdom was able both to foresee
   the famine and to cure it by decrees of government, healing the
   ill-favoured and starving kine by means of the fair and fat. [3793]
   And indeed you may understand by Joseph which you will, either the
   great lover and creator and namesake of immortality or his successor in
   throne and word and hoary hair, our new Peter, [3794] not inferior in
   virtue or fame to him by whom the middle course was destroyed and
   crushed, though it still wriggles a little weakly, like the tail of a
   snake after it is cut off; the one of whom, after having departed this
   life in a good old age after many conflicts and wrestlings, looks upon
   us from above, I well know, and reaches a hand to those who are
   labouring for the right:  and this the more, in proportion as he is
   freed from his bonds; and the other is hastening to the same end or
   dissolution of life, and is already drawing near the dwellers in
   heaven, but is still so far in the flesh as is needed to give the last
   aids to the Word, and to take his journey with richer provision.

   IV.  Of these great men and doctors and soldiers of the truth and
   victors, you are the nurslings and offspring; of these neither times
   nor tyrants, reason nor envy, nor fear, nor accuser, nor slanderer,
   whether waging open war against them, or plotting secretly; nor any who
   appeared to be of our side, nor any stranger, nor gold--that hidden
   tyrant, through which now almost everything is turned upside down and
   made to depend on the hazard of a die; nor flatteries nor threats, nor
   long and distant exiles (for they only could not be affected by
   confiscation, because of their great riches, which were--to possess
   nothing) nor anything else, whether absent or present or expected,
   could induce to take the worse part, and to be anywise traitor to the
   Trinity, or to suffer loss of the Godhead.  On the contrary indeed,
   they grew strong by dangers, and became more zealous for true
   religion.  For to suffer thus for Christ adds to one's love, and is as
   it were an earnest to high-souled men of further conflicts.  These, O
   Egypt, are thy present tales and wonders.

   V.  Once thou didst praise me thy Mendesian Goats, and thy Memphite
   Apis, a fatted and fleshy calf, and the rites of Isis, and the
   mutilations of Osiris, and thy venerable Serapis, a log that was
   honoured by myths and ages and the madness of its worshippers, as some
   unknown and heavenly matter, however it may have been aided by
   falsehood; and things yet more shameful than these, multiform images of
   monstrous beasts and creeping things, all of which Christ and the
   heralds of Christ have conquered, both the others who have been
   illustrious in their own times, and also the Fathers whom I have named
   just now; by whom, O admirable country, thou art more famous today than
   all others put together, whether in ancient or modern history.

   VI.  Wherefore I embrace and salute thee, O noblest of peoples and most
   Christian, and of warmest piety, and worthy of thy leaders; for I can
   find nothing greater to say of thee than this, nor anything by which
   better to welcome thee.  And I greet thee, to a small extent with my
   tongue, but very heartily with the movements of my affections. [3795]
   O my people, for I call you mine, as of one mind and one faith,
   instructed by the same Fathers, and adoring the same Trinity.  My
   people, for mine thou art, though it seem not so to those who envy me.
   And that they who are in this case may be the deeper wounded, see, I
   give the right hand of fellowship before so many witnesses, seen and
   unseen.  And I put away the old calumny by this new act of kindness.  O
   my people, for mine thou art, though in saying so I, who am least of
   all men, am claiming for myself that which is greatest.  For such is
   the grace of the Spirit that it makes of equal honour those who are of
   one mind.  O my people, for mine thou art, though it be afar, because
   we are divinely joined together, [3796] and in a manner wholly
   different to the unions of carnal people; for bodies are united in
   place, but souls are fitted together by the Spirit.  O my people, who
   didst formerly study how to suffer for Christ, but now if thou wilt
   hearken unto me, wilt study not to do aught, but to consider the power
   of doing to be a sufficient gain, and to deem that thou art offering a
   sacrifice to Christ, as in those days of thy endurance so in these of
   meekness.  O people to whom the Lord hath prepared Himself to do good,
   as to do evil to thine enemies. [3797]   O people, whom the Lord hath
   chosen to Himself out of all peoples; O people who art graven upon the
   hands of the Lord, to whom saith the Lord, Thou art My Will; and, Thy
   gates are carved work, and all the rest that is said to them that are
   being saved.  O people;--nay, marvel not at my insatiability that I
   repeat your name so often; for I delight in this continual naming of
   you, like those who can never have enough of their enjoyment of certain
   spectacles or sounds.

   VII.  But, O people of God and mine, beautiful also was your
   yesterday's assembly, which you held upon the sea, and pleasant, if any
   sight ever was, to the eyes, when I saw the sea like a forest, and
   hidden by a cloud made with hands, and the beauty and speed of your
   ships, as though ordered for a procession, and the slight breeze
   astern, as though purposely escorting you, and wafting to the City your
   city of the Sea.  Yet the present assembly which we now behold is more
   beautiful and more magnificent.  For you have not hastened to mingle
   with the larger number, nor have you reckoned religion by numbers, nor
   endured to be a mere unorganized rabble, rather than a people purified
   by the Word of God; but having, as is right, rendered to Cæsar the
   things that are Cæsar's, ye have offered besides to God the things that
   are God's; to the former Custom, to the latter Fear; and after feeding
   the people with your cargoes, you yourselves have come to be fed by
   us.  For we also distribute corn, and our distribution is perhaps not
   worth less than yours.  Come eat of my Bread and drink of the Wine
   which I have mingled for you. [3798]   I join with Wisdom in bidding
   you to my table.  For I commend your good feeling, and I hasten to meet
   your ready mind, because ye came to us as to your own harbour, running
   to your like; and ye valued the kindred Faith, and thought it monstrous
   that, while they who insult higher things are in harmony with each
   other and think alike, and think to make good each man's individual
   falsehood by their common conspiracy, like ropes which get strength
   from being twisted together; yet you should not meet nor combine with
   those who are of the same mind, with whom it is more reasonable that
   you should associate, for we gather in the Godhead also.  And that you
   may see that not in vain have you come to us, and that you have not
   brought up in a port among strangers and foreigners, but amongst your
   own people, and have been well guided by the Holy Ghost; we will
   discourse to you briefly concerning God; and do you recognize your own,
   like those who distinguish their kindred by the ensigns of their arms.

   VIII.  I find two highest differences in things that exist,
   viz.:--Rule, and Service; not such as among us either tyranny has cut
   or poverty has severed, but which nature has distinguished, if any like
   to use this word.  For That which is First is also above nature.  Of
   these the former is creative, and originating, and unchangeable; but
   the other is created, and subject and changing; or to speak yet more
   plainly, the one is above time, and the other subject to time.  The
   Former is called God, and subsists in Three Greatest, namely, the
   Cause, the Creator, and the Perfecter; I mean the Father, the Son, and
   the Holy Ghost, who are neither so separated from one another as to be
   divided in nature, nor so contracted as to be circumscribed by a single
   person; the one alternative being that of the Arian madness, the other
   that of the Sabellian heresy; but they are on the one hand more single
   than what is altogether divided, and on the other more abundant than
   what is altogether singular.  The other division is with us, and is
   called Creation, though one may be exalted above another according to
   the proportion of their nearness to God.

   IX.  This being so, if any be on the Lord's side let him come with us,
   [3799] and let us adore the One Godhead in the Three; not ascribing any
   name of humiliation to the unapproachable Glory, but having the
   exaltations of the Triune God continually in our mouth. [3800]   For
   since we cannot properly describe even the greatness of Its Nature, on
   account of Its infinity and undefinableness, how can we assert of It
   humiliation?  But if any one be estranged from God, and therefore
   divideth the One Supreme Substance into an inequality of Natures, it
   were marvellous if such an one were not cut in sunder by the sword, and
   his portion appointed with the unbelievers, [3801] reaping any evil
   fruit of his evil thought both now and hereafter.

   X.  What must we say of the Father, Whom by common consent all who have
   been preoccupied with natural conceptions share, although He hath
   endured the beginnings of dishonour, having been first divided by
   ancient innovation into the Good and the Creator.  And of the Son and
   of the Holy Ghost, see how simply and concisely we shall discourse.  If
   any one could say of Either that He was mutable or subject to change;
   or that either in time, or place, or power, or energy He could be
   measured; or that He was not naturally good, or not Self-moved, or not
   a free agent, or a Minister, or a Hymnsinger; or that He feared, or was
   a recipient of freedom, or was not counted with God; let him prove this
   and we will acquiesce, and will be glorified by the Majesty of our
   Fellow Servants, though we lose our God.  But if all that the Father
   has belongs likewise to the Son, except Causality; and all that is the
   Son's belongs also to the Spirit, except His Sonship, and whatsoever is
   spoken of Him as to Incarnation for me a man, and for my salvation,
   that, taking of mine, He may impart His own by this new commingling;
   then cease your babbling, though so late, O ye sophists of vain talk
   that falls at once to the ground; for why will ye die O House of
   Israel? [3802] --if I may mourn for you in the words of Scripture.

   XI.  For my part I revere also the Titles of the Word, which are so
   many, and so high and great, which even the demons respect.  And I
   revere also the Equal Rank of the Holy Ghost; and I fear the threat
   pronounced against those who blaspheme Him.  And blasphemy is not the
   reckoning Him God, but the severing Him from the Godhead.  And here you
   must remark that That which is blasphemed is Lord, and That which is
   avenged is the Holy Ghost, evidently as Lord.  I cannot bear to be
   unenlightened after my Enlightenment, by marking with a different stamp
   any of the Three into Whom I was baptized; and thus to be indeed buried
   in the water, and initiated not into Regeneration, but into death.

   XII.  I dare to utter something, O Trinity; and may pardon be granted
   to my folly, for the risk is to my soul.  I too am an Image of God, of
   the Heavenly Glory, though I be placed on earth.  I cannot believe that
   I am saved by one who is my equal.  If the Holy Ghost is not God, let
   Him first be made God, and then let Him deify me His equal.  But now
   what deceit this is on the part of grace, or rather of the givers of
   grace, to believe in God and to come away godless; by one set of
   questions and confessions leading to another set of conclusions.  Alas
   for this fair fame, if after the Laver I am blackened, if I am to see
   those who are not yet cleansed brighter than myself; if I am cheated by
   the heresy of my Baptizer; if I seek for the stronger Spirit and find
   Him not.  Give me a second Font before you think evil of the first.
   Why do you grudge me a complete regeneration?  Why do you make me, who
   am the Temple of the Holy Ghost as of God, the habitation of a
   creature?  Why do you honour part of what belongs to me, and dishonour
   part, judging falsely of the Godhead, to cut me off from the Gift, or
   rather to cut me in two by the gift?  Either honour the Whole, or
   dishonour the Whole, O new Theologian, that, if you are wicked, you may
   at any rate be consistent with yourself, and not judge unequally of an
   equal nature.

   XIII.  To sum up my discourse:--Glorify Him with the Cherubim, who
   unite the Three Holies into One Lord, [3803] and so far indicate the
   Primal Substance as their wings open to the diligent.  With David be
   enlightened, who said to the Light, In Thy Light shall we see Light,
   [3804] that is, in the Spirit we shall see the Son; and what can be of
   further reaching ray?  With John thunder, sounding forth nothing that
   is low or earthly concerning God, but what is high and heavenly, Who is
   in the beginning, and is with God, and is God the Word, [3805] and true
   God of the true Father, and not a good fellow-servant honoured only
   with the title of Son; and the Other Comforter (other, that is, from
   the Speaker, Who was the Word of God).  And when you read, I and the
   Father are One, [3806] keep before your eyes the Unity of Substance;
   but when you see, "We will come to him, and make Our abode with him,"
   [3807] remember the distinction of Persons; and when you see the Names,
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, think of the Three Personalities.

   XIV.  With Luke be inspired as you study the Acts of the Apostles.  Why
   do you range yourself with Ananias and Sapphira, those vain embezzlers
   (if indeed the theft of one's own property be a vain thing) and that by
   appropriating, not silver nor any other cheap and worthless thing, like
   a wedge of gold, [3808] or a didrachma, as did of old a rapacious
   soldier; but stealing the Godhead Itself, and lying, not to men but to
   God, as you have heard.  What?  Will you not reverence even the
   authority of the Spirit Who breathes upon whom, and when, and as He
   wills?  He comes upon Cornelius and his companions before Baptism, to
   others after Baptism, by the hands of the Apostles; so that from both
   sides, both from the fact that He comes in the guise of a Master and
   not of a Servant, and from the fact of His being sought to make
   perfect, the Godhead of the Spirit is testified.

   XV.  Speak of God with Paul, who was caught up to the third Heaven,
   [3809] and who sometimes counts up the Three Persons, and that in
   varied order, not keeping the same order, but reckoning one and the
   same Person now first, now second, now third; and for what purpose?
   Why, to shew the equality of the Nature.  And sometimes he mentions
   Three, sometimes Two or One, became That which is not mentioned is
   included.  And sometimes he attributes the operation of God to the
   Spirit, as in no respect different from Him, and sometimes instead of
   the Spirit he brings in Christ; and at times he separates the Persons
   saying, "One God, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord
   Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him;" [3810] at other
   times he brings together the one Godhead, "For of Him and through Him
   and in Him are all things;" [3811] that is, through the Holy Ghost, as
   is shown by many places in Scripture.  To Him be glory for ever and
   ever.  Amen.

   Oration XXXVII.

   On the Words of the Gospel, "When Jesus Had Finished These Sayings,"
   Etc.--S. Matt. xix. 1

   I.  Jesus Who Chose The Fishermen, Himself also useth a net, and
   changeth place for place.  Why?  Not only that He may gain more of
   those who love God by His visitation; but also, as it seems to me, that
   He may hallow more places.  To the Jews He becomes as a Jew that He may
   gain the Jews; to them that are under the Law as under the Law, that He
   may redeem them that are under the Law; to the weak as weak, that He
   may save the weak.  He is made all things to all men that He may gain
   all.  Why do I say, All things to all men?  For even that which Paul
   could not endure to say of himself I find that the Saviour suffered.
   For He is made not only a Jew, and not only doth He take to Himself all
   monstrous and vile names, but even that which is most monstrous of all,
   even very sin and very curse; not that He is such, but He is called
   so.  For how can He be sin, Who setteth us free from sin; and how can
   He be a curse, Who redeemeth us from the curse of the Law? [3812]   But
   it is in order that He may carry His display of humility even to this
   extent, and form us to that humility which is the producer of
   exaltation.  As I said then, He is made a Fisherman; He condescendeth
   to all; He casteth the net; He endureth all things, that He may draw up
   the fish from the depths, that is, Man who is swimming in the unsettled
   and bitter waves of life.

   II.  Therefore now also, when He had finished these sayings He departed
   from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan; He
   dwelleth well in Galilee, in order that the people which sat in
   darkness may see great Light. [3813]   He removeth to Judea in order
   that He may persuade people to rise up from the Letter and to follow
   the Spirit.  He teacheth, now on a mountain; now He discourseth on a
   plain; now He passeth over into a ship; now He rebuketh the surges.
   And perhaps He goes to sleep, in order that He may bless sleep also;
   perhaps He is tired that He may hallow weariness also; perhaps He weeps
   that He may make tears blessed.  He removeth from place to place, Who
   is not contained in any place; the timeless, the bodiless, the
   uncircumscript, the same Who was and is; Who was both above time, and
   came under time, and was invisible and is seen.  He was in the
   beginning and was with God, and was God. [3814]   The word Was occurs
   the third time to be confirmed by number.  What He was He laid aside;
   what He was not He assumed; not that He became two, but He deigned to
   be One made out of the two.  For both are God, that which assumed, and
   that which was assumed; two Natures meeting in One, not two Sons (let
   us not give a false account of the blending).  He who is such and so
   great--but what has befallen me?  I have fallen into human language.
   For how can So Great be said of the Absolute, and how can That which is
   without quantity be called Such?  But pardon the word, for I am
   speaking of the greatest things with a limited instrument.  And That
   great and long-suffering and formless and bodiless Nature will endure
   this, namely, my words as if of a body, and weaker than the truth.  For
   if He condescended to Flesh, He will also endure such language.

   III.  And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there,
   where the multitude was greater.  If He had abode upon His own
   eminence, if He had not condescended to infirmity, if He had remained
   what He was, keeping Himself unapproachable and incomprehensible, a few
   perhaps would have followed Him--perhaps not even a few, possibly only
   Moses--and He only so far as to see with difficulty the Back Parts of
   God. [3815]   For He penetrated the cloud, either being placed outside
   the weight of the body or being withdrawn from his senses; for how
   could he have gazed upon the subtlety, or the incorporeity, or I know
   not how one should call it, of God, being incorporate and using
   material eyes?  But inasmuch as He strips Himself for us, inasmuch as
   He comes down (and speak of an exinanition, as it were, a laying aside
   and a diminution of His glory), He becomes by this comprehensible.

   IV.  And pardon me meanwhile that I again suffer a human affection.  I
   am filled with indignation and grief for my Christ (and would that you
   might sympathize with me) when I see my Christ dishonoured on this
   account on which He most merited honour.  Is He on this account to be
   dishonoured, tell me, that for you He was humble?  Is He therefore a
   Creature, because He careth for the creature?  Is He therefore subject
   to time, because He watches over those who are subject to time?  Nay,
   He beareth all things, He endureth all things. [3816]   And what
   marvel?  He put up with blows, He bore spittings, He tasted gall for my
   taste.  And even now He bears to be stoned, not only by those who deal
   despitefully with Him, but also by ourselves who seem to reverence
   Him.  For to use corporeal names when discoursing of the incorporeal is
   perhaps the part of those who deal despitefully and stone Him; but
   pardon, I say again to our infirmity, for I do not willingly stone Him;
   but having no other words to use, we use what we have.  Thou art called
   the Word, and Thou art above Word; Thou art above Light, yet art named
   Light; Thou art called Fire not as perceptible to sense, but because
   Thou purgest light and worthless matter; a Sword, because Thou severest
   the worse from the better; a Fan, because Thou purgest the
   threshing-floor, and blowest away all that is light and windy, and
   layest up in the garner above all that is weighty and full; an Axe,
   because Thou cuttest down the worthless fig-tree, after long patience,
   because Thou cuttest away the roots of wickedness; the Door, because
   Thou bringest in; the Way, because we go straight; the Sheep, because
   Thou art the Sacrifice; the High Priest, because Thou offerest the Body
   the Son, because Thou art of the Father.  Again I stir men's tongues;
   again some men rave against Christ, or rather against me, who have been
   deemed worthy to be a herald of the Word.  I am like John, The Voice of
   one crying in the wilderness [3817] --a wilderness that once was dry,
   but now is only too populous.

   V.  But, as I was saying, to return to my argument; for this reason
   great multitudes followed Him, because He condescended to our
   infirmities.  What next?  The Pharisees also, it says, came unto Him,
   tempting Him, and saying unto Him, is it lawful for a man to put away
   his wife for every cause?  Again the Pharisees tempt Him; again they
   who read the Law do not know the Law; again they who are expounders of
   the Law need others to teach them.  It was not enough that Sadducees
   should tempt Him concerning the Resurrection, and Lawyers question Him
   about perfection, and the Herodians about the poll-tax, and others
   about authority; but some one must also ask about Marriage at Him who
   cannot be tempted, the Creator of wedlock, Him who from the First Cause
   made this whole race of mankind.  And He answered and said unto them,
   Have ye not read that He which made them at the beginning made them
   male and female?  He knoweth how to solve some of their questions and
   to bridle others.  When He is asked, By what authority doest thou these
   things? He Himself, because of the utter ignorance of those who asked
   Him, replies with another question; The baptism of John, was it from
   Heaven or of men?  He on both sides entangles His questioners, so that
   we also are able, following the example of Christ, sometimes to check
   those who argue with us over-officiously, and with still more absurd
   questions to solve the absurdity of their questions.  For we too are
   wise in vanity at times, if I may boast of the things of folly.  But
   when He sees a question that calls for reasoning, then He does not deem
   His questioners unworthy of prudent answers.

   VI.  The question which you have put seems to me to do honour to
   chastity, and to demand a kind reply.  Chastity, in respect of which I
   see that the majority of men are ill-disposed, and that their laws are
   unequal and irregular.  For what was the reason why they restrained the
   woman, but indulged the man, and that a woman who practises evil
   against her husband's bed is an adulteress, and the penalties of the
   law for this are very severe; but if the husband commits fornication
   against his wife, he has no account to give?  I do not accept this
   legislation; I do not approve this custom.  They who made the Law were
   men, and therefore their legislation is hard on women, since they have
   placed children also under the authority of their fathers, while
   leaving the weaker sex uncared for.  God doth not so; but saith Honour
   thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise;
   that it may be well with thee; and, He that curseth father or mother,
   let him die the death.  Similarly He gave honour to good and punishment
   to evil.  And, The blessing of a father strengtheneth the houses of
   children, but the curse of a mother uprooteth the foundations. [3818]
   See the equality of the legislation.  There is one Maker of man and
   woman; one debt is owed by children to both their parents.

   VII.  How then dost thou demand Chastity, while thou dost not thyself
   observe it?  How dost thou demand that which thou dost not give?  How,
   though thou art equally a body, dost thou legislate unequally?  If thou
   enquire into the worse--The Woman Sinned, and so did Adam. [3819]   The
   serpent deceived them both; and one was not found to be the stronger
   and the other the weaker.  But dost thou consider the better?  Christ
   saves both by His Passion.  Was He made flesh for the Man?  So He was
   also for the woman.  Did He die for the Man?  The Woman also is saved
   by His death.  He is called of the seed of David; [3820] and so perhaps
   you think the Man is honoured; but He is born of a Virgin, and this is
   on the Woman's side.  They two, He says, shall be one Flesh; so let the
   one flesh have equal honour.  And Paul legislates for chastity by His
   example.  How, and in what way?  This Sacrament is great, he says, But
   I speak concerning Christ and the Church. [3821]   It is well for the
   wife to reverence Christ through her husband:  and it is well for the
   husband not to dishonor the Church through his wife.  Let the wife, he
   says, see that she reverence her husband, for so she does Christ; but
   also he bids the husband cherish his wife, for so Christ does the
   Church. [3822]   Let us, then, give further consideration to this
   saying.

   VIII.  Churn milk and it will be butter; [3823] examine this and
   perhaps you may find something more nourishing in it.  For I think that
   the Word here seems to deprecate second marriage.  For, if there were
   two Christs, there may be two husbands or two wives; but if Christ is
   One, one Head of the Church, let there be also one flesh, and let a
   second be rejected; and if it hinder the second what is to be said for
   a third?  The first is law, the second is indulgence, the third is
   transgression, and anything beyond this is swinish, such as has not
   even many examples of its wickedness.  Now the Law grants divorce for
   every cause; but Christ not for every cause; but He allows only
   separation from the whore; and in all other things He commands
   patience.  He allows to put away the fornicatress, because she corrupts
   the offspring; but in all other matters let us be patient and endure;
   or rather be ye [3824] enduring and patient, as many as have received
   the yoke of matrimony.  If you see lines or marks upon her, take away
   her ornaments; if a hasty tongue, restrain it; if a meretricious laugh,
   make it modest; if immoderate expenditure or drink, reduce it; if
   unseasonable going out, shackle it; if a lofty eye, chastise it.  It is
   uncertain which is in danger, the separator or the separated.  Let thy
   fountain of water, it says, be only thine own, and let no stranger
   share it with thee; [3825] and, let the colt of thy favours and the
   stag of thy love company with thee; do thou then take care not to be a
   strange river, nor to please others better than thine own wife.  But if
   thou be carried elsewhere, then thou makest a law of lewdness for thy
   partner also.  Thus saith the Saviour.

   IX.  But what of the Pharisees?  To them this word seems harsh.  Yes,
   for they are also displeased at other noble words--both the older
   Pharisees, and the Pharisees of the present day.  For it is not only
   race, but disposition also that makes a Pharisee.  Thus also I reckon
   as an Assyrian or an Egyptian him who is ranged among these by his
   character.  What then say the Pharisees?  If the case of the man be so
   with his wife, it is not good to marry.  Is it only now, O Pharisee,
   that thou understandest this, It is not good to marry? [3826]   Didst
   thou not know it before when thou sawest widowhoods, and orphanhoods,
   and untimely deaths, and mourning succeeding to shouting, and funerals
   coming upon weddings, and childlessness, and all the comedy or tragedy
   that is connected with this?  Either is most appropriate language.  It
   is good to marry; I too admit it, for marriage is honourable in all,
   and the bed undefiled. [3827]   It is good for the temperate, not for
   those who are insatiable, and who desire to give more than due honour
   to the flesh.  When marriage is only marriage and conjunction and the
   desire for a succession of children, marriage is honourable, for it
   brings into the world more to please God.  But when it kindles matter,
   and surrounds us with thorns, and as it were discovers the way of vice,
   then I too say, It is not good to marry.

   X.  Marriage is honourable; but I cannot say that it is more lofty than
   virginity; for virginity were no great thing if it were not better than
   a good thing.  Do not however be angry, ye women that are subject to
   the yoke.  We must obey God rather than man.  But be ye bound together,
   both virgins and wives, and be one in the Lord, and each others'
   adornment.  There would be no celibate if there were no marriage.  For
   whence would the virgin have passed into this life?  Marriage would not
   have been venerable unless it had borne virgin fruit to God and to
   life.  Honour thou also thy mother, of whom thou wast born.  Honour
   thou also her who is of a mother and is a mother. [3828]   A mother she
   is not, but a Bride of Christ she is.  The visible beauty is not
   hidden, but that which is unseen is visible to God.  All the glory of
   the King's Daughter is within, [3829] clothed with golden fringes,
   embroidered whether by actions or by contemplation.  And she who is
   under the yoke, let her also in some degree be Christ's; and the virgin
   altogether Christ's.  Let the one be not entirely chained to the world,
   [3830] and let the other not belong to the world at all.  For that
   which is a part to the yoked, is to the virgin all in all.  Hast thou
   chosen the life of Angels?  Art thou ranked among the unyoked?  Sink
   not down to the flesh; sink not down to matter; be not wedded to
   matter, while otherwise thou remainest unwedded.  A lascivious eye
   guardeth not virginity; a meretricious tongue mingles with the Evil
   One; feet that walk disorderly accuse of disease or danger.  Let the
   mind also be virgin; let it not rove about; let it not wander; let it
   not carry in itself forms of evil things (for the form is a part of
   harlotry); let it not make idols in its soul of hateful things.

   XI.  But He said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save
   they to whom it is given.  Do you see the sublimity of the matter?  It
   is found to be nearly incomprehensible.  For surely it is more than
   carnal that that which is born of flesh should not beget to the flesh.
   Surely it is Angelic that she who is bound to flesh should live not
   according to flesh, but be loftier than her nature.  The flesh bound
   her to the world, but reason led her up to God.  The flesh weighed her
   down, but reason gave her wings; the flesh bound her, but desire loosed
   her.  With thy whole soul, O Virgin, be intent upon God (I give this
   same injunction to men and to women); and do not take the same view in
   other respects of what is honourable as the mass of men do; of family,
   of wealth, of throne, of dynasty, of that beauty which shews itself in
   complexion and composition of members, the plaything of time and
   disease.  If thou hast poured out upon God the whole of thy love; if
   thou hast not two objects of desire, both the passing and the abiding,
   both the visible and the invisible, then thou hast been so pierced by
   the arrow of election, and hast so learned the beauty of the
   Bridegroom, that thou too canst say with the bridal drama and song,
   thou art sweetness and altogether loveliness.

   XII.  You see how streams confined in lead pipes, through being much
   compressed and carried to one point, often so far depart from the
   nature of water that that which is pushed from behind will often flow
   constantly upwards.  So if thou confine thy desire, and be wholly
   joined to God, thou wilt not fall downward; thou wilt not be
   dissipated; thou wilt remain entirely Christ's, until thou see Christ
   thy Bridegroom.  Keep thyself unapproachable, both in word and work and
   life, and thought and action.  From all sides the Evil One interferes
   with thee; he spies thee everywhere, where he may strike, where wound
   thee; let him not find anything bared and ready to his stroke.  The
   purer he sees thee, the more he strives to stain thee, for the stains
   on a shining garment are more conspicuous.  Let not eye draw eye, nor
   laughter, nor familiarity night, lest night bring destruction.  For
   that which is gradually drawn away and stolen, works a mischief which
   is unperceived at the time, but yet attains to the consummation of
   wickedness.

   XIII.  All men, He saith, cannot receive this saying, but they to whom
   it is given.  When you hear this, It is given, do not understand it in
   a heretical fashion, and bring in differences of nature, the earthly
   and the spiritual and the mixed.  For there are people so evilly
   disposed as to think that some men are of an utterly ruined nature, and
   some of a nature which is saved, and that others are of such a
   disposition as their will may lead them to, either to the better, or to
   the worse.  For that men may have a certain aptitude, one more, another
   less, I too admit; but not that this aptitude alone suffices for
   perfection, but that it is reason which calls this out, that nature may
   proceed to action, just as fire is produced when a flint is struck with
   iron.  When you hear To whom it is given, add, And it is given to those
   who are called and to those who incline that way.  For when you hear,
   Not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
   sheweth mercy, [3831] I counsel you to think the same.  For since there
   are some who are so proud of their successes that they attribute all to
   themselves and nothing to Him that made them and gave them wisdom and
   supplied them with good; such are taught by this word that even to wish
   well needs help from God; or rather that even to choose what is right
   is divine and a gift of the mercy of God.  For it is necessary both
   that we should be our own masters and also that our salvation should be
   of God.  This is why He saith not of him that willeth; that is, not of
   him that willeth only, nor of him that runneth only, but also of God.
   That sheweth mercy.  Next; since to will also is from God, he has
   attributed the whole to God with reason.  However much you may run,
   however much you may wrestle, yet you need one to give the crown.
   Except the Lord build the house, they laboured in vain that built it:
   Except the Lord keep the city, in vain they watched that keep it.
   [3832]   I know, He says, that the race is not to the swift, nor the
   battle to the strong, [3833] nor the victory to the fighters, nor the
   harbours to the good sailors; but to God it belongs both to work
   victory, and to bring the barque safe to port.

   XIV.  In another place it is also said and understood, and perhaps it
   is necessary that I should add it as follows to what has already been
   said, in order that I may impart to you also my wealth.  The Mother of
   the Sons of Zebedee, in an impulse of parental affection, asked a thing
   in ignorance of the measure of what she was asking, [3834] but
   pardonably, through the excess of her love and of the kindness due to
   her children.  For there is nothing more affectionate than a
   Mother,--and I speak of this that I may lay down a law for honouring
   Mothers.  Their mother, then, asked Jesus that they might sit, the one
   on His right hand, the other on his left.  But what saith the Saviour?
   He first asks if they can drink the Cup Which He Himself was about to
   drink; and when this was professed, and the Saviour accepted the
   profession (for He knew that they were being perfected by the same, or
   rather that they would be perfected thereby); what saith He?  "They
   shall drink the cup; but to sit on My right hand and on My left--it is
   not Mine, He saith, to give this, but to whom it hath been given."  Is
   then the ruling mind nothing?  Nothing the labour?  Nothing the
   reasoning?  Nothing the philosophy?  Nothing the fasting?  Nothing the
   vigils, the sleeping on the ground, the shedding floods of tears?  Is
   it for nothing of these, but in accordance with some election by lot,
   that a Jeremias is sanctified, and others are estranged from the womb?

   XV.  I fear lest some monstrous reasoning may come in, as of the soul
   having lived elsewhere, and then having been bound to this body, and
   that it is from that other life that some receive the gift of prophecy,
   and others are condemned, namely, those who lived badly.  But since
   such a conception is too absurd, and contrary to the traditions of the
   Church (others if they like may play with such doctrines, but it is
   unsafe for us to play with them); we must in this place too add to the
   words "To whom it hath been given," this, "who are worthy;" who have
   not only received this character from the Father, but have given it to
   themselves.

   XVI.  For there are eunuchs which were made eunuchs from their mother's
   womb, etc.  I should very much like to be able to say something bold
   about eunuchs.  Be not proud, ye who are eunuchs by nature.  For, in
   point of self-restraint, this is perhaps unwilling.  For it has not
   come to the test, nor has your self-restraint been proved by trial.
   For the good which is by nature is not a subject of merit; that which
   is the result of purpose is laudable.  What merit has fire for burning,
   for it is its nature to burn?  What merit has water for falling, a
   property given to it by its Maker?  What thanks does the snow get for
   its coldness, or the sun for its shining?--It shines even if it does
   not wish.  Claim merit if you please by willing the better things.  You
   will claim it if, being carnal, you make yourself spiritual; if, while
   drawn down by the leaden flesh, you receive wings from reason; if
   though lowly born, you are found to be heavenly; if while chained down
   to the flesh, you shew yourself superior to the flesh.

   XVII.  Since then, natural chastity is not meritorious, I demand
   something else from the eunuchs.  Do not go a whoring in respect of the
   Godhead.  Having been wedded to Christ, do not dishonour Christ.  Being
   perfected by the spirit, do not make the Spirit your own equal.  If I
   yet pleased men, says Paul, I should not be the servant of Christ.
   [3835]   If I worshipped a creature, I should not be called a
   Christian.  For why is Christianity precious?  Is it not that Christ is
   God, unless my mingling with Him in love is a mere human passion?  And
   yet I honour Peter, but I am not called a Petrine; and Paul, but have
   never been called a Pauline.  I cannot allow myself to be named after a
   man, who am born of God.  So then, if it is because you believe Him to
   be God that you are called a Christian, may you ever be so called, and
   may you remain in both the name and the thing; but if you are called
   from Christ only because you have an affection for Him, you attribute
   no more to him than other names which are given from some practice or
   fact.

   XVIII.  Consider those men who are devoted to horse racing.  They are
   named after the colours and the sides on which they have placed
   themselves.  You know the names without my mentioning them.  If it is
   thus that you have got the name of Christian, the mere title is a very
   small thing even though you pride yourself upon it.  But if it is
   because you believe Him to be God, shew your faith by your works.  If
   the Son is a creature, even now also you are worshipping the creature
   instead of the Creator.  If the Holy Ghost is a creature, you are
   baptized in vain, and are only sound on two sides, or rather not even
   on them; but on one you are altogether in danger.  Imagine the Trinity
   to be a single pearl, alike on all sides and equally glistening.  If
   any part of the pearl be injured; the whole beauty of the stone is
   gone.  So when you dishonour the Son in order to honour the Father, He
   does not accept your honour.  The Father doth not glory in the
   dishonour of the Son.  If a wise Son maketh a glad Father, [3836] how
   much more doth the honour of the Son become that of the Father!  And if
   you also accept this saying, My Son, glory not in the dishonour of thy
   Father, [3837] similarly the Father doth not glory in the Son's
   dishonour.  If you dishonour the Holy Ghost, the Son receiveth not your
   honour.  For though He be not of the Father in the same way as the Son,
   yet He is of the same Father.  Either honour the whole or dishonour the
   whole, so as to have a consistent mind.  I cannot accept your half
   piety.  I would have you altogether pious, but in the way that I
   desire.  Pardon my affection:  I am grieved even for those who hate
   me.  You were one of my members, even though you are now cut off:
   perhaps you will again become a member; and therefore I speak kindly.
   Thus much for the sake of the Eunuchs, that they may be chaste in
   respect of the Godhead.

   XIX.  For it is not only bodily sin which is called fornication and
   adultery, but any sin you have committed, and especially transgression
   against that which is divine.  Perhaps you ask how we can prove
   this:--They went a whoring, it says, with their own inventions. [3838]
     Do you see an impudent act of fornication?  And again, They committed
   adultery in the wood. [3839]   See you a kind of adulterous religion?
   Do not then commit spiritual adultery, while keeping your bodies
   chaste.  Do not shew that it is unwillingly you are chaste in body, by
   not being chaste where you can commit fornication.  Why have you done
   your impiety?  Why are you hurried to vice, so that it is all one to
   call a man a Eunuch or a villain?  Place yourselves on the side of men,
   and, even though so late, have some manly thoughts.  Avoid the women's
   apartments; do not let the disgrace of proclamation be added to the
   disgrace of the name.  Would you have us persevere a little longer in
   this discourse, or are you tired with what we have said?  Nay, by what
   follows let even the eunuchs be honoured.  For the word is one of
   praise.

   XX.  There are, He says, some eunuchs which were so born from their
   mother's womb; and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of
   men; and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the
   Kingdom of Heaven's sake.  He that is able to receive it, let him
   receive it.  I think that the discourse would sever itself from the
   body, and represent higher things by bodily figures; for to stop the
   meaning at bodily eunuchs would be small and very weak, and unworthy of
   the Word; and we must understand in addition something worthy of the
   Spirit.  Some, then, seem by nature to incline to good.  And when I
   speak of nature, I am not slighting free will, but supposing both--an
   aptitude for good, and that which brings the natural aptitude to
   effect.  And there are others whom reason cleanses, by cutting them off
   from the passions.  These I imagine to be meant by those whom men have
   made Eunuchs, when the word of teaching distinguishing the better from
   the worse and rejecting the one and commanding the other (like the
   verse, Depart from evil and do good), [3840] works spiritual chastity.
   This sort of making eunuchs I approve; and I highly praise both
   teachers and taught, that the one have nobly effected, and the other
   still more nobly endured, the cutting off.

   XXI.  And there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the
   Kingdom of Heaven's sake.  Others, too, who have not met with teachers,
   have been laudable teachers to themselves.  No father nor mother, no
   Priest or Bishop, nor any of those commissioned to teach, taught you
   your duty; but by moving reason in yourself and by kindling the spark
   of good by your free will, you made yourself a eunuch, and acquired
   such a habit of virtue that impulse to vice became almost an
   impossibility to you.  Therefore I praise this kind of Eunuch-making
   also, and perhaps even above the others.  He that is able to receive it
   let him receive it.  Choose which part you will; either follow the
   Teacher or be your own teacher.  One thing alone is shameful--that the
   passions be not extirpated.  It matters not how they are extirpated.
   The teacher is God's creature; and you also have the same origin; and
   whether the teacher grasp this grace, or the good be your own--it is
   equally good.

   XXII.  Only let us cut ourselves off from passion, lest any root of
   bitterness springing up trouble us; [3841] only let us follow the
   image; only let us reverence our Archetype.  Cut off the bodily
   passions; cut off also the spiritual.  For by how much the soul is more
   precious than the body, by so much more precious is it to cleanse the
   soul than the body.  And if cleansing of the body be a praiseworthy
   act, see, I pray you, how much greater and higher is that of the soul.
   Cut away the Arian impiety; cut away the false opinion of Sabellius; do
   not join more than is right, or wrongly sever; do not either confuse
   the Three Persons into One, or make Three diversities of Nature.  The
   One is praiseworthy if rightly understood; and the Three when rightly
   divided, when the division is of Persons, not of Godhead.

   XXIII.  I enact this for Laymen too, and I enjoin it also upon all
   Priests, and upon those commissioned to rule.  Come to the aid of the
   Word, all of you to whom God has given power to aid.  It is a great
   thing to check murder, to punish adultery, to chastise theft; much more
   to establish piety by law, and to bestow sound doctrine.  My word will
   not be able to do as much in fighting for the Holy Trinity as your
   Edict, if you will bridle the ill disposed, if you will help the
   persecuted, if you will check the slayers, and prevent people from
   being slain.  I am speaking not merely of bodily but of spiritual
   slaughter.  For all sin is the death of the soul.  Here let my
   discourse end.

   XXIV.  But it remains that I speak a prayer for those who are
   assembled.  Husbands alike and wives, rulers and ruled, old men, and
   young men, and maidens, every sort of age, bear ye every loss whether
   of money or of body, but one thing alone do not endure--to lose the
   Godhead.  I adore the Father, I adore the Son, I adore the Holy Ghost;
   or rather We adore them; I, who am speaking, before all and after all
   and with all, in the same Christ our Lord, to whom be the glory and the
   might for ever.  Amen.

   Oration XXXVIII.

   On the Theophany, or Birthday of Christ.

   The Title of this Oration has given rise to a doubt whether it was
   preached on Dec. 25, 380, or on Jan. 6, 381.  The word Theophania is
   well known as a name for the Epiphany; which, however, according to
   Schaff, [3842] was originally a celebration both of the Nativity and
   the Baptism of our Lord.  The two words seem both to have been used in
   the simplest sense of the Manifestation of God, and certainly were
   applied to Christmas Day.  Thus Suidas, "The Epiphany is the
   Incarnation of the Saviour;" and Epiphanius (Hær., 53), "The Day of the
   Epiphany is the day on which Christ was born according to the flesh."
   But S. Jerome applies the word to the Baptism of Christ; "The day of
   the Epiphany is still venerable; not, as some think, on account of His
   Birth in the flesh; for then He was hidden, not manifested; but it
   agrees with the time at which it was said, This is My beloved Son (In
   Ezech. I.).  There is also a Sermon, attributed to S. Chrysostom, "On
   the Baptism of Christ," in which it is expressly denied that the name
   Theophany applies to Christmas.  The Oration itself, however, contains
   evidence to shew that the Festival of our Lord's Birth was kept at the
   earlier date; for in c. 16 the Preacher says, "A little later you shall
   see Jesus submitting to be purified in the river Jordan for my
   purification."  And another piece of evidence occurs in the oration In
   Sancta Lumina, c. 14, "At His Birth we duly kept festival, both I the
   leader of the feast, and you.  Now we are come to another action of
   Christ and another Mystery."

   The Oration is thus analysed by Abbe Benoît:

   "After an exordium which is full of the enthusiasm and joy which such a
   subject naturally inspires the Orator recommends his hearers to
   celebrate the Festival by a pious gladness, and by hearing the Word of
   God; and not as the heathen celebrated their feasts, by profane
   amusements and all kinds of excess.  He will try to satisfy their
   desires by speaking to them of God.  God is infinite, ineffable,
   eternal, the Sovereign Good.  He created the Angels in the beginning
   out of goodness.  The fall of the Angels was followed by the creation
   of the material world.  Man too fell, and God shewed His mercy even in
   the punishment.  He used various means to raise him again; and at
   length He came Himself.  Then the speaker forcibly argues against those
   who misuse the infinite condescension of the Word to contest His
   Godhead; he rapidly traces the principal features of His Life--at once
   human and Divine; and ends with a recommendation to his hearers to
   imitate in all things the Life of Christ, so that they may have a share
   in His Kingdom in Heaven."

   It is considered one of the best of Gregory's discourses.  "By the
   grandeur of the plan," says Benoît, "the elevation of the ideas, and
   the rich fund of doctrine, this discourse is incontestably one of S.
   Gregory's most remarkable efforts."

   I.  Christ is born, glorify ye Him.  Christ from heaven, go ye out to
   meet Him.  Christ on earth; be ye exalted.  Sing unto the Lord all the
   whole earth; [3843] and that I may join both in one word, Let the
   heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, for Him Who is of heaven
   and then of earth.  Christ in the flesh, rejoice with trembling and
   with joy; with trembling because of your sins, with joy because of your
   hope.  Christ of a Virgin; O ye Matrons live as Virgins, that ye may be
   Mothers of Christ.  Who doth not worship Him That is from the
   beginning?  Who doth not glorify Him That is the Last?

   II.  Again the darkness is past; again Light is made; again Egypt is
   punished with darkness; again Israel is enlightened by a pillar. [3844]
     The people that sat in the darkness of ignorance, let it see the
   Great Light of full knowledge. [3845]   Old things are passed away,
   behold all things are become new. [3846]   The letter gives way, the
   Spirit comes to the front.  The shadows flee away, the Truth comes in
   upon them.  Melchisedec is concluded. [3847]   He that was without
   Mother becomes without Father (without Mother of His former state,
   without Father of His second).  The laws of nature are upset; the world
   above must be filled.  Christ commands it, let us not set ourselves
   against Him.  O clap your hands together all ye people, [3848] because
   unto us a Child is born, and a Son given unto us, Whose Government is
   upon His shoulder (for with the Cross it is raised up), and His Name is
   called The Angel of the Great Counsel of the Father. [3849]   Let John
   cry, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: [3850]   I too will cry the power
   of this Day.  He Who is not carnal is Incarnate; the Son of God becomes
   the Son of Man, Jesus Christ the Same yesterday, and to-day, and for
   ever. [3851]   Let the Jews be offended, let the Greeks deride; [3852]
   let heretics talk till their tongues ache.  Then shall they believe,
   when they see Him ascending up into heaven; and if not then, yet when
   they see Him coming out of heaven and sitting as Judge.

   III.  Of these on a future occasion; for the present the Festival is
   the Theophany or Birth-day, for it is called both, two titles being
   given to the one thing.  For God was manifested to man by birth.  On
   the one hand Being, and eternally Being, of the Eternal Being, above
   cause and word, for there was no word before The Word; and on the other
   hand for our sakes also Becoming, that He Who gives us our being might
   also give us our Well-being, or rather might restore us by His
   Incarnation, when we had by wickedness fallen from wellbeing.  The name
   Theophany is given to it in reference to the Manifestation, and that of
   Birthday in respect of His Birth.

   IV.  This is our present Festival; it is this which we are celebrating
   to-day, the Coming of God to Man, that we might go forth, [3853] or
   rather (for this is the more proper expression) that we might go back
   to God--that putting off the old man, we might put on the New; and that
   as we died in Adam, so we might live in Christ, [3854] being born with
   Christ and crucified with Him and buried with Him and rising with Him.
   [3855]   For I must undergo the beautiful conversion, and as the
   painful succeeded the more blissful, so must the more blissful come out
   of the painful.  For where sin abounded Grace did much more abound;
   [3856] and if a taste condemned us, how much more doth the Passion of
   Christ justify us?  Therefore let us keep the Feast, not after the
   manner of a heathen festival, but after a godly sort; not after the way
   of the world, but in a fashion above the world; not as our own but as
   belonging to Him Who is ours, or rather as our Master's; not as of
   weakness, but as of healing; not as of creation, but of re-creation.

   V.  And how shall this be?  Let us not adorn our porches, nor arrange
   dances, nor decorate the streets; let us not feast the eye, nor enchant
   the ear with music, nor enervate the nostrils with perfume, nor
   prostitute the taste, nor indulge the touch, those roads that are so
   prone to evil and entrances for sin; let us not be effeminate in
   clothing soft and flowing, whose beauty consists in its uselessness,
   nor with the glittering of gems or the sheen of gold [3857] or the
   tricks of colour, belying the beauty of nature, and invented to do
   despite unto the image of God; Not in rioting and drunkenness, with
   which are mingled, I know well, chambering and wantonness, since the
   lessons which evil teachers give are evil; or rather the harvests of
   worthless seeds are worthless.  Let us not set up high beds of leaves,
   making tabernacles for the belly of what belongs to debauchery.  Let us
   not appraise the bouquet of wines, the kickshaws of cooks, the great
   expense of unguents.  Let not sea and land bring us as a gift their
   precious dung, for it is thus that I have learnt to estimate luxury;
   and let us not strive to outdo each other in intemperance (for to my
   mind every superfluity is intemperance, and all which is beyond
   absolute need),--and this while others are hungry and in want, who are
   made of the same clay and in the same manner.

   VI.  Let us leave all these to the Greeks and to the pomps and
   festivals of the Greeks, who call by the name of gods beings who
   rejoice in the reek of sacrifices, and who consistently worship with
   their belly; evil inventors and worshippers of evil demons.  But we,
   the Object of whose adoration is the Word, if we must in some way have
   luxury, let us seek it in word, and in the Divine Law, and in
   histories; especially such as are the origin of this Feast; that our
   luxury may be akin to and not far removed from Him Who hath called us
   together.  Or do you desire (for to-day I am your entertainer) that I
   should set before you, my good Guests, the story of these things as
   abundantly and as nobly as I can, that ye may know how a foreigner can
   feed [3858] the natives of the land, and a rustic the people of the
   town, and one who cares not for luxury those who delight in it, and one
   who is poor and homeless those who are eminent for wealth?

   We will begin from this point; and let me ask of you who delight in
   such matters to cleanse your mind and your ears and your thoughts,
   since our discourse is to be of God and Divine; that when you depart,
   you may have had the enjoyment of delights that really fade not away.
   And this same discourse shall be at once both very full and very
   concise, that you may neither be displeased at its deficiencies, nor
   find it unpleasant through satiety.

   VII.  God always was, [3859] and always is, and always will be.  Or
   rather, God always Is.  For Was and Will be are fragments of our time,
   and of changeable nature, but He is Eternal Being.  And this is the
   Name that He gives to Himself when giving the Oracle to Moses in the
   Mount.  For in Himself He sums up and contains all Being, having
   neither beginning in the past nor end in the future; like some great
   Sea of Being, limitless and unbounded, transcending all conception of
   time and nature, only adumbrated by the mind, and that very dimly and
   scantily...not by His Essentials, but by His Environment; one image
   being got from one source and another from another, and combined into
   some sort of presentation of the truth, which escapes us before we have
   caught it, and takes to flight before we have conceived it, blazing
   forth upon our Master-part, even when that is cleansed, as the
   lightning flash which will not stay its course, does upon our
   sight...in order as I conceive by that part of it which we can
   comprehend to draw us to itself (for that which is altogether
   incomprehensible is outside the bounds of hope, and not within the
   compass of endeavour), and by that part of It which we cannot
   comprehend to move our wonder, and as an object of wonder to become
   more an object of desire, and being desired to purify, and by purifying
   to make us like God; [3860] so that when we have thus become like
   Himself, God may, to use a bold expression, hold converse with us as
   Gods, being united to us, and that perhaps to the same extent as He
   already knows those who are known to Him.  The Divine Nature then is
   boundless and hard to understand; and all that we can comprehend of Him
   is His boundlessness; even though one may conceive that because He is
   of a simple nature He is therefore either wholly incomprehensible, or
   perfectly comprehensible.  For let us further enquire what is implied
   by "is of a simple nature."  For it is quite certain that this
   simplicity is not itself its nature, just as composition is not by
   itself the essence of compound beings.

   VIII.  And when Infinity is considered from two points of view,
   beginning and end (for that which is beyond these and not limited by
   them is Infinity), when the mind looks to the depth above, not having
   where to stand, and leans upon phenomena to form an idea of God, it
   calls the Infinite and Unapproachable which it finds there by the name
   of Unoriginate.  And when it looks into the depths below, and at the
   future, it calls Him Undying and Imperishable.  And when it draws a
   conclusion from the whole it calls Him Eternal (aionios).  For Eternity
   (haion) is neither time nor part of time; for it cannot be measured.
   But what time, measured by the course of the sun, is to us, that
   Eternity is to the Everlasting, namely, a sort of time-like movement
   and interval co-extensive with their existence.  This, however, is all
   I must now say about God; for the present is not a suitable time, as my
   present subject is not the doctrine of God, but that of the
   Incarnation.  But when I say God, I mean Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
   For Godhead is neither diffused beyond these, so as to bring in a mob
   of gods; nor yet is it bounded by a smaller compass than these, so as
   to condemn us for a poverty-stricken conception of Deity; either
   Judaizing to save the Monarchia, or falling into heathenism by the
   multitude of our gods.  For the evil on either side is the same, though
   found in contrary directions.  This then is the Holy of Holies, [3861]
   which is hidden even from the Seraphim, and is glorified with a thrice
   repeated Holy, [3862] meeting in one ascription of the Title Lord and
   God, as one of our predecessors has most beautifully and loftily
   pointed out.

   IX.  But since this movement of self-contemplation alone could not
   satisfy Goodness, but Good must be poured out and go forth beyond
   Itself to multiply the objects of Its beneficence, for this was
   essential to the highest Goodness, He first conceived the Heavenly and
   Angelic Powers.  And this conception was a work fulfilled by His Word,
   and perfected by His Spirit.  And so the secondary Splendours came into
   being, as the Ministers of the Primary Splendour; whether we are to
   conceive of them as intelligent Spirits, or as Fire of an immaterial
   and incorruptible kind, or as some other nature approaching this as
   near as may be.  I should like to say that they were incapable of
   movement in the direction of evil, and susceptible only of the movement
   of good, as being about God, and illumined with the first rays from
   God--for earthly beings have but the second illumination; but I am
   obliged to stop short of saying that, and to conceive and speak of them
   only as difficult to move because of him, [3863] who for his splendour
   was called Lucifer, but became and is called Darkness through his
   pride; and the apostate hosts who are subject to him, creators of evil
   [3864] by their revolt against good and our inciters.

   X.  Thus, then, and for these reasons, He gave being to the world of
   thought, as far as I can reason upon these matters, and estimate great
   things in my own poor language.  Then when His first creation was in
   good order, He conceives a second world, material and visible; and this
   a system and compound of earth and sky, and all that is in the midst of
   them--an admirable creation indeed, when we look at the fair form of
   every part, but yet more worthy of admiration when we consider the
   harmony and the unison of the whole, and how each part fits in with
   every other, in fair order, and all with the whole, tending to the
   perfect completion of the world as a Unit.  This was to shew that He
   could call into being, not only a Nature akin to Himself, but also one
   altogether alien to Himself.  For akin to Deity are those natures which
   are intellectual, and only to be comprehended by mind; but all of which
   sense can take cognisance are utterly alien to It; and of these the
   furthest removed are all those which are entirely destitute of soul and
   of power of motion.  But perhaps some one of those who are too festive
   and impetuous may say, What has all this to do with us?  Spur your
   horse to the goal.  Talk to us about the Festival, and the reasons for
   our being here to-day.  Yes, this is what I am about to do, although I
   have begun at a somewhat previous point, being compelled to do so by
   love, and by the needs of my argument.

   XI.  Mind, then, and sense, thus distinguished from each other, had
   remained within their own boundaries, and bore in themselves the
   magnificence of the Creator-Word, silent praisers [3865] and thrilling
   heralds of His mighty work.  Not yet was there any mingling of both,
   nor any mixtures of these opposites, tokens of a greater Wisdom and
   Generosity in the creation of natures; nor as yet were the whole riches
   of Goodness made known.  Now the Creator-Word, determining to exhibit
   this, and to produce a single living being out of both--the visible and
   the invisible creations, I mean--fashions Man; and taking a body from
   already existing matter, and placing in it a Breath taken from Himself
   [3866] which the Word knew to be an intelligent soul and the Image of
   God, as a sort of second world.  He placed him, great in littleness
   [3867] on the earth; a new Angel, a mingled worshipper, fully initiated
   into the visible creation, but only partially into the intellectual;
   King of all upon earth, but subject to the King above; earthly and
   heavenly; temporal and yet immortal; visible and yet intellectual;
   half-way between greatness and lowliness; in one person combining
   spirit and flesh; spirit, because of the favour bestowed on him; flesh,
   because of the height to which he had been raised; the one that he
   might continue to live and praise his Benefactor, the other that he
   might suffer, and by suffering be put in remembrance, and corrected if
   he became proud of his greatness.  A living creature trained here, and
   then moved elsewhere; and, to complete the mystery, deified by its
   inclination to God.  For to this, I think, tends that Light of Truth
   which we here possess but in measure, that we should both see and
   experience the Splendour of God, which is worthy of Him Who made us,
   and will remake us again after a loftier fashion.

   XII.  This being He placed in Paradise, whatever the Paradise may have
   been, having honoured him with the gift of Free Will (in order that God
   might belong to him as the result of his choice, no less than to Him
   who had implanted the seeds of it), to till the immortal plants, by
   which is meant perhaps the Divine Conceptions, both the simpler and the
   more perfect; naked in his simplicity and inartificial life, and
   without any covering or screen; for it was fitting that he who was from
   the beginning should be such.  Also He gave him a Law, as a material
   for his Free Will to act upon.  This Law was a Commandment as to what
   plants he might partake of, and which one he might not touch.  This
   latter was the Tree of Knowledge; not, however, because it was evil
   from the beginning when planted; nor was it forbidden because God
   grudged it to us...Let not the enemies of God wag their tongues in that
   direction, or imitate the Serpent...But it would have been good if
   partaken of at the proper time, for the tree was, according to my
   theory, Contemplation, upon which it is only safe for those who have
   reached maturity of habit to enter; but which is not good for those who
   are still somewhat simple and greedy in their habit; just as solid food
   is not good for those who are yet tender, and have need of milk. [3868]
     But when through the Devil's malice and the woman's caprice, to which
   she succumbed as the more tender, and which she brought to bear upon
   the man, as she was the more apt to persuade, alas for my weakness!
   (for that of my first father was mine), he forgot the Commandment which
   had been given to him; [3869] he yielded to the baleful fruit; and for
   his sin he was banished, at once from the Tree of Life, and from
   Paradise, and from God; and put on the coats of skins...that is,
   perhaps, the coarser flesh, both mortal and contradictory.  This was
   the first thing that he learnt--his own shame; [3870] and he hid
   himself from God.  Yet here too he makes a gain, namely death, and the
   cutting off of sin, in order that evil may not be immortal.  Thus his
   punishment is changed into a mercy; for it is in mercy, I am persuaded,
   that God inflicts punishment.

   XIII.  And having been first chastened by many means (because his sins
   were many, whose root of evil sprang up through divers causes and at
   sundry times), by word, by law, by prophets, by benefits, by threats,
   by plagues, by waters, by fires, by wars, by victories, by defeats, by
   signs in heaven and signs in the air and in the earth and in the sea,
   by unexpected changes of men, of cities, of nations (the object of
   which was the destruction of wickedness), at last he needed a stronger
   remedy, for his diseases were growing worse; mutual slaughters,
   adulteries, perjuries, unnatural crimes, and that first and last of all
   evils, idolatry and the transfer of worship from the Creator to the
   Creatures.  As these required a greater aid, so also they obtained a
   greater.  And that was that the Word of God Himself--Who is before all
   worlds, the Invisible, the Incomprehensible, the Bodiless, Beginning of
   Beginning, [3871] the Light of Light, the Source of Life and
   Immortality, the Image of the Archetypal Beauty, the immovable Seal,
   the unchangeable Image, the Father's Definition [3872] and Word, came
   to His own Image, and took on Him flesh for the sake of our flesh, and
   mingled Himself with an intelligent soul for my soul's sake, purifying
   like by like; and in all points except sin was made man.  Conceived by
   the Virgin, [3873] who first in body and soul was purified by the Holy
   Ghost [3874] (for it was needful both that Childbearing should be
   honoured, and that Virginity should receive a higher honour), He came
   forth then as God with that which He had assumed, One Person in two
   Natures, Flesh and Spirit, of which the latter deified the former.
   [3875]   O new commingling; O strange conjunction; the Self-Existent
   comes into being, the Uncreate is created, That which cannot be
   contained is contained, by the intervention of an intellectual soul,
   mediating between the Deity and the corporeity of the flesh.  And He
   Who gives riches becomes poor, for He assumes the poverty of my flesh,
   that I may assume the richness of His Godhead.  He that is full empties
   Himself, for He empties Himself of His glory for a short while, that I
   may have a share in His Fulness.  What is the riches of His Goodness?
   What is this mystery that is around me?  I had a share in the image; I
   did not keep it; He partakes of my flesh that He may both save the
   image and make the flesh immortal.  He communicates a second Communion
   far more marvellous than the first, inasmuch as then He imparted the
   better Nature, whereas now Himself partakes of the worse.  This is more
   godlike than the former action, this is loftier in the eyes of all men
   of understanding.

   XIV.  To this what have those cavillers to say, those bitter reasoners
   about Godhead, those detractors of all that is praiseworthy, those
   darkeners of light, uncultured in respect of wisdom, for whom Christ
   died in vain, those unthankful creatures, the work of the Evil One?  Do
   you turn this benefit into a reproach to God?  Wilt thou deem Him
   little on this account, that He humbled Himself for thee; because the
   Good Shepherd, [3876] He who lays down His life for His sheep, came to
   seek for that which had strayed upon the mountains and the hills, on
   which thou wast then sacrificing, and found the wanderer; and having
   found it, [3877] took it upon His shoulders--on which He also took the
   Wood of the Cross; and having taken it, brought it back to the higher
   life; and having carried it back, numbered it amongst those who had
   never strayed.  Because He lighted a candle--His own Flesh--and swept
   the house, cleansing the world from sin; and sought the piece of money,
   the Royal Image that was covered up by passions.  And He calls together
   His Angel friends on the finding of the coin, and makes them sharers in
   His joy, [3878] whom He had made to share also the secret of the
   Incarnation?  Because on the candle of the Forerunner there follows the
   light that exceeds in brightness; and to the Voice the Word succeeds;
   and to the Bridegroom's friend the Bridegroom; to him that prepared for
   the Lord a peculiar people, cleansing them by water in preparation for
   the Spirit?  Dost thou reproach God with all this?  Dost thou on this
   account deem Him lessened, because He girds Himself with a towel and
   washes His disciples' feet, and shows that humiliation is the best road
   to exaltation?  Because for the soul that was bent to the ground He
   humbles Himself, that He may raise up with Himself the soul that was
   tottering to a fall under a weight of sin?  Why dost thou not also
   charge upon Him as a crime the fact that He eats with Publicans and at
   Publicans' tables, [3879] and that He makes disciples of Publicans,
   that He too may gain somewhat...and what?...the salvation of sinners.
   If so, we must blame the physician for stooping over sufferings, and
   enduring evil odours that he may give health to the sick; or one who as
   the Law commands bent down into a ditch to save a beast that had fallen
   into it. [3880]

   XV.  He was sent, but as man, for He was of a twofold Nature; for He
   was wearied, and hungered, and was thirsty, and was in an agony, and
   shed tears, according to the nature of a corporeal being.  And if the
   expression be also used of Him as God, the meaning is that the Father's
   good pleasure is to be considered a Mission, for to this He refers all
   that concerns Himself; both that He may honour the Eternal Principle,
   and because He will not be taken to be an antagonistic God.  And
   whereas it is written both that He was betrayed, and also that He gave
   Himself up [3881] and that He was raised up by the Father, and taken up
   into heaven; and on the other hand, that He raised Himself and went up;
   the former statement of each pair refers to the good pleasure of the
   Father, the latter to His own Power.  Are you then to be allowed to
   dwell upon all that humiliates Him, while passing over all that exalts
   Him, and to count on your side the fact that He suffered, but to leave
   out of the account the fact that it was of His own will?  See what even
   now the Word has to suffer.  By one set He is honoured as God, but is
   confused with the Father, [3882] by another He is dishonoured as mere
   flesh [3883] and severed from the Godhead.  With which of them will He
   be most angry, or rather, which shall He forgive, those who injuriously
   confound Him or those who divide Him?  For the former ought to have
   distinguished, and the latter to have united Him; the one in number,
   the other in Godhead.  Stumblest Thou at His flesh?  So did the Jews.
   Or dost thou call Him a Samaritan, and...I will not say the rest.  Dost
   thou disbelieve in His Godhead?  This did not even the demons, O thou
   who art less believing than demons and more stupid than Jews.  Those
   did perceive that the name of Son implies equality of rank; these did
   know that He who drove them out was God, for they were convinced of it
   by their own experience.  But you will admit neither the equality nor
   the Godhead.  It would have been better for you to have been either a
   Jew or a demoniac (if I may utter an absurdity), than in uncircumcision
   and in sound health to be so wicked and ungodly in your attitude of
   mind.

   XVI.  A little later on you will see Jesus submitting to be purified in
   the River Jordan for my Purification, or rather, sanctifying the waters
   by His Purification (for indeed He had no need of purification Who
   taketh away the sin of the world) and the heavens cleft asunder, and
   witness borne to him by the Spirit That is of one nature with Him;
   [3884] you shall see Him tempted and conquering and served by Angels,
   [3885] and healing every sickness [3886] and every disease, [3887] and
   giving life to the dead (O that He would give life to you who are dead
   because of your heresy), and driving out demons, [3888] sometimes
   Himself, sometimes by his disciples; and feeding vast multitudes with a
   few loaves; [3889] and walking dryshod upon seas; [3890] and being
   betrayed and crucified, and crucifying with Himself my sin; offered as
   a Lamb, and offering as a Priest; as a Man buried in the grave, and as
   God rising again; and then ascending, and to come again in His own
   glory.  Why what a multitude of high festivals there are in each of the
   mysteries of the Christ; all of which have one completion, namely, my
   perfection and return to the first condition of Adam.

   XVII.  Now then I pray you accept His Conception, and leap before Him;
   if not like John from the womb, [3891] yet like David, because of the
   resting of the Ark. [3892]   Revere the enrolment on account of which
   thou wast written in heaven, and adore the Birth by which thou wast
   loosed from the chains of thy birth, [3893] and honour little
   Bethlehem, which hath led thee back to Paradise; and worship the manger
   through which thou, being without sense, wast fed by the Word.  Know as
   Isaiah bids thee, thine Owner, like the ox, and like the ass thy
   Master's crib; [3894] if thou be one of those who are pure and lawful
   food, and who chew the cud of the word and are fit for sacrifice.  Or
   if thou art one of those who are as yet unclean and uneatable and unfit
   for sacrifice, and of the gentile portion, run with the Star, and bear
   thy Gifts with the Magi, gold and frankincense and myrrh, [3895] as to
   a King, and to God, and to One Who is dead for thee.  With Shepherds
   glorify Him; [3896] with Angels join in chorus; with Archangels sing
   hymns.  Let this Festival be common to the powers in heaven and to the
   powers upon earth. [3897]   For I am persuaded that the Heavenly Hosts
   join in our exultation and keep high Festival with us to-day [3898]
   ...because they love men, and they love God just like those whom David
   introduces after the Passion ascending with Christ [3899] and coming to
   meet Him, and bidding one another to lift up the gates.

   XVIII.  One thing connected with the Birth of Christ I would have you
   hate...the murder of the infants by Herod. [3900]   Or rather you must
   venerate this too, the Sacrifice of the same age as Christ, slain
   before the Offering of the New Victim.  If He flees into Egypt, [3901]
   joyfully become a companion of His exile.  It is a grand thing to share
   the exile of the persecuted Christ.  If He tarry long in Egypt, call
   Him out of Egypt by a reverent worship of Him there.  Travel without
   fault through every stage and faculty of the Life of Christ.  Be
   purified; be circumcised; strip off the veil which has covered thee
   from thy birth.  After this teach in the Temple, and drive out the
   sacrilegious traders. [3902]   Submit to be stoned if need be, for well
   I wot thou shalt be hidden from those who cast the stones; thou shalt
   escape even through the midst of them, like God. [3903]   If thou be
   brought before Herod, answer not for the most part. [3904]   He will
   respect thy silence more than most people's long speeches.  If thou be
   scourged, [3905] ask for what they leave out.  Taste gall for the
   taste's sake; [3906] drink vinegar; [3907] seek for spittings; accept
   blows, be crowned with thorns, [3908] that is, with the hardness of the
   godly life; put on the purple robe, take the reed in hand, and receive
   mock worship from those who mock at the truth; lastly, be crucified
   with Him, and share His Death and Burial gladly, that thou mayest rise
   with Him, and be glorified with Him and reign with Him.  Look at and be
   looked at by the Great God, Who in Trinity is worshipped and glorified,
   and Whom we declare to be now set forth as clearly before you as the
   chains of our flesh allow, in Jesus Christ our Lord, to Whom be the
   glory for ever.  Amen.

   Gregory is the ordinary one found in the Fathers.  Thus, e.g.,
   Theodoret says, "Christ our Lord is without Mother as God, for He was
   begotten of the Father alone; and without Father as Man, for He was
   born of a pure Virgin."  OEcumenius has almost the exact words of
   Gregory.  So also S. Augustine (Tract in Joann, 8), "Christ was
   singularly born of a Father without a Mother, of a Mother without a
   Father; without Mother as God, without Father as Man."

   [3861] The Holy of Holies here means the Holy Trinity.

   [3862] The reference is to the Ter Sanctus or Triumphal Hymn, which is
   found in every Liturgy.  The previous writer referred to is thought by
   some to be S. Athanasius, but by others S. Dionysius the Areopagite,
   who has some words on this point in his treatise De Coelest. Hier., c.
   7.  But the most competent scholars deny the authenticity of the works
   attributed to S. Dionysius, and place them from one hundred to one
   hundred and fifty years later than S. Gregory's time.

   [3863] S. Thomas Aquinas (Summa I., qu. 63, art. 7) gives reasons for
   thinking that Satan was originally the highest of all the angelic
   hosts.  This, however, is an opinion in which many high authorities
   differ from him.  At any rate, Satan as Lucifer must have held a very
   high place.

   [3864] Evil, says Nicetas here, has no positive existence, but is the
   negation of good.  "The faculties of mind and body which are used in a
   sinful action are indeed things, and are the creatures of God; but the
   sin itself is not a thing, and consequently not a creature.  God is
   indeed the Author of all that is, of every substance; but sin is not a
   substance, and is not.  It is a declination from substance and from
   being, and not a part of it."  (Mozley, Treatise on the Augustinian

   and He is of the Beginning, inasmuch as God the Father is the
   Unoriginate Principle of all, and the Origin and Fount of Godhead.  The
   Scholiast here refers to Ps. cx. 3, which in the Vulgate and LXX. runs
   "With Thee is the Beginning in the day of Thy Power."

   [3872] Cf. Theol.:  IV. xx., where S. Gregory says "Perhaps this
   Relation might be compared to that between the Definition and the thing
   defined."  Nicetas remarks that, just as the definition declares the
   nature of the defined, so the Personal Word shows forth the Nature of
   the Father.  Suidas (in voce horos) says that the phrase is used to
   show the Unity of Nature between the Father and the Son.  It is not,
   however, of frequent occurrence.

   [3880] S. Gregory is referring to the provision of the Law, which
   orders a man, if he see his friend's or his enemy's ox or ass fallen
   under a burden or going astray, to lend assistance; but the terms of
   his reference are rather to the reasoning of our Lord with the
   Pharisees about the Sabbath.  Luke xiii. 15 and xiv. 5.

   but the whole expression is in Chrys. (cent. xi., ib., 129) and Greek
   S. James (78. 272-3), but Syriac S. James has "in qua nocte tradendus
   erat."  (Canon Univ., Æthiop. Hammond, 258).  Pridie quam patereturis
   the form in the Canon of the Roman, Ambrosian, and Sarum Missals; but
   the Mozarabic, which is largely of an Eastern character, has in qua
   nocte tradebatur.  (Hammond, 333).

   [3882] The Sabellian heresy may be briefly described as the doctrine of
   One God exercising three offices, as opposed to the Catholic Faith of
   One God in three Persons.  Sabellius himself was a Priest of the Libyan
   Pentapolis, who at Rome in the time of Pope Zephyrinus embraced the
   heresy of Notus, which maintained that God the Father suffered for us
   on the cross in the form of Christ.  His followers, who openly declared
   themselves first about a.d. 357, thought that God, to Whom as the
   Source of all things the name of Father is given, is called the Son
   when He united Himself to the humanity of Jesus for the work of our
   redemption; and in like manner He is the Holy Spirit when manifested
   for the work of sanctification.  Sabellius was condemned by a Council
   held at Rome, probably in 258; again at Nicæa, and again at
   Constantinople, where Sabellian Baptism was pronounced invalid.

   [3883] Arianism was the result of a strong opposition to Sabellianism,
   coupled with a misunderstanding of the argument against it.  There was,
   no doubt, a danger of falling into the opposite error of Tritheism, to
   avoid which Arianism "divided the Substance" and virtually--and in the
   end explicity--denied the Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Arius was
   a Priest of Alexandria, and it was there that he began to publish his
   opinions, in the early years of the Fourth Century (318); but Newman
   traces the origin of the heresy to Antioch and its Judaizing tendency.
   At a meeting of the clergy in Alexandria the Bishop, S. Alexander, gave
   an address on the coeternity, and coequality of the Father and the Son,
   and used the expression ten auten ousian echein, that They had the same
   Substance.  Arius protested against this as a Sabellian statement, and
   used the words ktisma (creature) and poiema (a thing made) of the Son,
   adding the sentence which became so famous, en hote ouk en,--there was
   a time when the Son did not exist.  Having ineffectually tried private
   remonstrance, S. Alexander brought the matter in 321 before his
   Provincial Synod, in which were present about 100 Egyptian and
   Pentapolitan Bishops, who after giving the matter a patient hearing,
   excommunicated Arius and his principal adherents.  But it was too late
   to undo the mischief.  The heresy spread widely, and the whole Eastern
   Church was stirred by the controversy.  At last a great Council of the
   whole Church met at Nicæa in 325, summoned by the Emperor; and there
   the heresy was unequivocally condemned, and the great Creed propounded
   with its watchword, the Homoousion.  The false teaching had however
   struck its roots deep and wide; and though now banned by the anathema
   of the Church, it was long in dying; and indeed at one time, it seemed
   as if--humanly speaking--it must swamp the whole Catholic Church.
   Under various forms the Semi-Arians who claimed to differ from the
   faith of Nicæa only by a single letter, the Aetians and Eunomians, who
   went to the furthest extreme of the Falsehood (Anomoeans), and many
   others, the heresy spread far and wide:  and when S. Gregory came to
   Constantinople there was not one Catholic Church or Priest to be found
   in the place, and only a few scattered folk who still held to the Faith
   of the Consubstantial.  Gregory's wonderful discourses however came to
   their aid, and partly under his presidency was held the Second
   OEcumenical Synod, which condemned the heresy of Macedonius, a still
   further development of Arianism, which denied also the Deity of the
   Holy Ghost.  Arianism survived for another two centuries among the
   Goths and Vandals, the Burgundians and Lombards; but it never rose
   again as a power in the Church.

   Oration XXXIX.

   Oration on the Holy Lights.

   The Oration on the Holy Lights was preached on the Festival of the
   Epiphany 381, and was followed the next day by that on Baptism.  In the
   Eastern Church this Festival is regarded as more particularly the
   commemoration of our Lord's Baptism, and is accordingly one of the
   great days for the solemn ministration of the Sacrament.  It is
   generally called Theophania, and the Gospel in the Liturgy is S.
   Matthew iii. 13-17.  The Sunday in the Octave is called meta ta phota
   (After The Lights), pointing to a time when the Feast was known as the
   "Holy Lights," as seems to have been the case in S. Gregory's day.
   This name is derived from Baptism, which was often in ancient days
   called Illumination, in reference to which name (derived from the
   spiritual grace of the Sacrament) lighted torches or candles were
   carried by the neophytes.  It would appear that the solemnites of the
   Festival lasted two days, of which the second was devoted to the solemn
   conferring of the Sacrament.  Accordingly we find two Orations
   belonging to the Festival.  In the first, delivered on the Day itself
   he dwells more especially on the Feast and the Mystery of our Lord's
   Baptism therein commemorated; and proceeds to speak of the different
   kinds of Baptism, of which he enumerates Five, viz.:--

   1.  The figurative Baptism of Israel by Moses in the cloud and in the
   Sea.

   2.  The preparatory Baptism of repentance ministered by S. John the
   Baptist.

   3.  The spiritual Baptism of water and the Holy Ghost given us by our
   Lord.

   4.  The glorious Baptism of Martyrdom.

   5.  The painful Baptism of Penance.

   In speaking of this last he takes occasion to refute the extreme
   rigorism of the followers of Novatus, who denied absolution to certain
   classes of sins committed after Baptism.

   In the second Oration, delivered next day, he dwells on the Sacrament
   of Baptism and its spiritual effects; and takes occasion to reprove the
   then still prevalent practice of deferring Baptism till the near
   approach of death.  He likewise dwells on the truth that the validity
   and spiritual effect of the Sacrament is wholly independent of the rank
   or worthiness of the Priest who may minister it; and he concludes with
   a sketch of the obligations which its reception involves, with a very
   valuable exposition of the Creed, and of the Ceremonies which
   accompanied the administration of the Sacrament.

   I.  Again My Jesus, and again a mystery; not deceitful nor disorderly,
   nor belonging to Greek error or drunkenness (for so I call their
   solemnities, and so I think will every man of sound sense); but a
   mystery lofty and divine, and allied to the Glory above.  For the Holy
   Day of the Lights, to which we have come, and which we are celebrating
   to-day, has for its origin the Baptism of my Christ, the True Light
   That lighteneth every man that cometh into the world, [3909] and
   effecteth my purification, and assists that light which we received
   from the beginning from Him from above, but which we darkened and
   confused by sin.

   II.  Therefore listen to the Voice of God, which sounds so exceeding
   clearly to me, who am both disciple and master of these mysteries, as
   would to God it may sound to you; I Am The Light Of The World. [3910]
   Therefore approach ye to Him and be enlightened, and let not your faces
   be ashamed, [3911] being signed with the true Light.  It is a season of
   new birth, [3912] let us be born again.  It is a time of reformation,
   let us receive again the first Adam. [3913]   Let us not remain what we
   are, but let us become what we once were.  The Light Shineth In
   Darkness, [3914] in this life and in the flesh, and is chased by the
   darkness, but is not overtaken by it:--I mean the adverse power leaping
   up in its shamelessness against the visible Adam, but encountering God
   and being defeated;--in order that we, putting away the darkness, may
   draw near to the Light, and may then become perfect Light, the children
   of perfect Light.  See the grace of this Day; see the power of this
   mystery.  Are you not lifted up from the earth?  Are you not clearly
   placed on high, being exalted by our voice and meditation? and you will
   be placed much higher when the Word shall have prospered the course of
   my words.

   III.  Is there any such among the shadowy purifications of the Law,
   aiding as it did with temporary sprinklings, and the ashes of an heifer
   sprinkling the unclean; [3915] or do the gentiles celebrate any such
   thing in their mysteries, every ceremony and mystery of which to me is
   nonsense, and a dark invention of demons, and a figment of an unhappy
   mind, aided by time, and hidden by fable?  For what they worship as
   true, they veil as mythical.  But if these things are true, they ought
   not to be called myths, but to be proved not to be shameful; [3916] and
   if they are false, they ought not to be objects of wonder; nor ought
   people so inconsiderately to hold the most contrary opinions about the
   same thing, as if they were playing in the market-place with boys or
   really ill-disposed men, not engaged in discussion with men of sense,
   and worshippers of the Word, though despisers of this artificial
   plausibility.

   IV.  We are not concerned in these mysteries with birth of Zeus and
   thefts of the Cretan Tyrant [3917] (though the Greeks may be displeased
   at such a title for him), nor with the name of Curetes, and the armed
   dances, which were to hide the wailings of a weeping god, that he might
   escape from his father's hate.  For indeed it would be a strange thing
   that he who was swallowed as a stone should be made to weep as a child.
   [3918]   Nor are we concerned with Phrygian mutilations and flutes and
   Corybantes, [3919] and all the ravings of men concerning Rhea,
   consecrating people to the mother of the gods, and being initiated into
   such ceremonies as befit the mother of such gods as these.  Nor have we
   any carrying away of the Maiden, [3920] nor wandering of Demeter, nor
   her intimacy with Celei and Triptolemi and Dragons; nor her doings and
   sufferings...for I am ashamed to bring into daylight that ceremony of
   the night, and to make a sacred mystery of obscenity.  Eleusis knows
   these things, and so do those who are eyewitnesses of what is there
   guarded by silence, and well worthy of it.  Nor is our commemoration
   one of Dionysus, and the thigh that travailed with an incomplete birth,
   as before a head had travailed with another; [3921] nor of the
   hermaphrodite god, nor a chorus of the drunken and enervated host; nor
   of the folly of the Thebans which honours him; nor the thunderbolt of
   Semele which they adore.  Nor is it the harlot mysteries of Aphrodite,
   who, as they themselves admit, was basely born and basely honoured; nor
   have we here Phalli and Ithyphalli, [3922] shameful both in form and
   action; nor Taurian massacres of strangers; [3923] nor blood of
   Laconian youths shed upon the altars, as they scourged themselves with
   the whips; [3924] and in this case alone use their courage badly, who
   honour a goddess, and her a virgin.  For these same people both honour
   effeminacy, and worship boldness.

   V.  And where will you place the butchery of Pelops, [3925] which
   feasted hungry gods, that bitter and inhuman hospitality?  Where the
   horrible and dark spectres of Hecate, and the underground puerilities
   and sorceries of Trophonius, or the babblings of the Dodonæan Oak, or
   the trickeries of the Delphian tripod, or the prophetic draught of
   Castalia, which could prophesy anything, except their own being brought
   to silence? [3926]   Nor is it the sacrificial art of Magi, and their
   entrail forebodings, nor the Chaldæan astronomy and horoscopes,
   comparing our lives with the movements of the heavenly bodies, which
   cannot know even what they are themselves, or shall be.  Nor are these
   Thracian orgies, from which the word Worship (threskeia) is said to be
   derived; nor rites and mysteries of Orpheus, whom the Greeks admired so
   much for his wisdom that they devised for him a lyre which draws all
   things by its music.  Nor the tortures of Mithras [3927] which it is
   just that those who can endure to be initiated into such things should
   suffer; nor the manglings of Osiris, [3928] another calamity honoured
   by the Egyptians; nor the ill-fortunes of Isis [3929] and the goats
   more venerable than the Mendesians, and the stall of Apis, [3930] the
   calf that luxuriated in the folly of the Memphites, nor all those
   honours with which they outrage the Nile, while themselves proclaiming
   it in song to be the Giver of fruits and corn, and the measurer of
   happiness by its cubits. [3931]

   VI.  I pass over the honours they pay to reptiles, and their worship of
   vile things, each of which has its peculiar cultus and festival, and
   all share in a common devilishness; so that, if they were absolutely
   bound to be ungodly, and to fall away from honouring God, and to be led
   astray to idols and works of art and things made with hands, men of
   sense could not imprecate anything worse upon themselves than that they
   might worship just such things, and honour them in just such a way;
   that, as Paul says, they might receive in themselves that recompense of
   their error which was meet, [3932] in the very objects of their
   worship; not so much honouring them as suffering dishonour by them;
   abominable because of their error, and yet more abominable from the
   vileness of the objects of their adoration and worship; so that they
   should be even more without understanding than the objects of their
   worship; being as excessively foolish as the latter are vile.

   VII.  Well, let these things be the amusement of the children of the
   Greeks and of the demons to whom their folly is due, who turn aside the
   honour of God to themselves, and divide men in various ways in pursuit
   of shameful thoughts and fancies, ever since they drove us away from
   the Tree of Life, by means of the Tree of Knowledge unseasonably [3933]
   and improperly imparted to us, and then assailed us as now weaker than
   before; carrying clean away the mind, which is the ruling power in us,
   and opening a door to the passions.  For, being of a nature envious and
   man-hating, or rather having become so by their own wickedness, they
   could neither endure that we who were below should attain to that which
   is above, having themselves fallen from above upon the earth; nor that
   such a change in their glory and their first natures should have taken
   place.  This is the meaning of their persecution of the creature.  For
   this God's Image was outraged; and as we did not like to keep the
   Commandments, [3934] we were given over to the independence of our
   error.  And as we erred we were disgraced by the objects of our
   worship.  For there was not only this calamity, that we who were made
   for good works [3935] to the glory and praise of our Maker, and to
   imitate God as far as might be, were turned into a den of all sorts of
   passions, which cruelly devour and consume the inner man; but there was
   this further evil, that man actually made gods the advocates of his
   passions, so that sin might be reckoned not only irresponsible, but
   even divine, taking refuge in the objects of his worship as his
   apology.

   VIII.  But since to us grace has been given to flee from superstitious
   error and to be joined to the truth and to serve the living and true
   God, and to rise above creation, passing by all that is subject to time
   and to first motion; let us look at and reason upon God and things
   divine in a manner corresponding to this Grace given us.  But let us
   begin our discussion of them from the most fitting point.  And the most
   fitting is, as Solomon laid down for us; us; The beginning of wisdom,
   he says, is to get wisdom. [3936]   And what this is he tells us; the
   beginning of wisdom is fear. [3937]   For we must not begin with
   contemplation and leave off with fear (for an unbridled contemplation
   would perhaps push us over a precipice), but we must be grounded and
   purified and so to say made light by fear, and thus be raised to the
   height.  For where fear is there is keeping of commandments; and where
   there is keeping of commandments there is purifying of the flesh, that
   cloud which covers the soul and suffers it not to see the Divine Ray.
   And where there is purifying there is Illumination; and Illumination is
   the satisfying of desire to those who long for the greatest things, or
   the Greatest Thing, or That Which surpasses all greatness.

   IX.  Wherefore we must purify ourselves first, and then approach this
   converse with the Pure; unless we would have the same experience as
   Israel, [3938] who could not endure the glory of the face of Moses, and
   therefore asked for a veil; [3939] or else would feel and say with
   Manoah "We are undone O wife, we have seen God," [3940] although it was
   God only in his fancy; or like Peter would send Jesus out of the boat,
   [3941] as being ourselves unworthy of such a visit; and when I say
   Peter, I am speaking of the man who walked upon the waves; [3942] or
   like Paul would be stricken in eyes, [3943] as he was before he was
   cleansed from the guilt of his persecution, when he conversed with Him
   Whom he was persecuting--or rather with a short flash of That great
   Light; or like the Centurion [3944] would seek for healing, but would
   not, through a praiseworthy fear, receive the Healer into his house.
   Let each one of us also speak so, as long as he is still uncleansed,
   and is a Centurion still, commanding many in wickedness, and serving in
   the army of Cæsar, the World-ruler of those who are being dragged down;
   "I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof."  But when he
   shall have looked upon Jesus, though he be little of stature like
   Zaccheus [3945] of old, and climb up on the top of the sycamore tree by
   mortifying his members which are upon the earth, [3946] and having
   risen above the body of humiliation, then he shall receive the Word,
   and it shall be said to him, This day is salvation come to this house.
   [3947]   Then let him lay hold on the salvation, and bring forth fruit
   more perfectly, scattering and pouring forth rightly that which as a
   publican he wrongly gathered.

   X.  For the same Word is on the one hand terrible through its nature to
   those who are unworthy, and on the other through its loving kindness
   can be received by those who are thus prepared, who have driven out the
   unclean and worldly spirit from their souls, and have swept and adorned
   their own souls by self-examination, and have not left them idle or
   without employment, so as again to be occupied with greater armament by
   the seven spirits of wickedness...the same number as are reckoned of
   virtue (for that which is hardest to fight against calls for the
   sternest efforts)...but besides fleeing from evil, practise virtue,
   making Christ entirely, or at any rate to the greatest extent possible,
   to dwell within them, so that the power of evil cannot meet with any
   empty place to fill it again with himself, and make the last state of
   that man worse than the first, by the greater energy of his assault,
   and the greater strength and impregnability of the fortress.  But when,
   having guarded our soul with every care, and having appointed goings up
   in our heart, [3948] and broken up our fallow ground, [3949] and sown
   unto righteousness, [3950] as David and Solomon and Jeremiah bid us,
   let us enlighten ourselves with the light of knowledge, and then let us
   speak of the Wisdom of God that hath been hid in a mystery, [3951] and
   enlighten others.  Meanwhile let us purify ourselves, and receive the
   elementary initiation of the Word, that we may do ourselves the utmost
   good, making ourselves godlike, and receiving the Word at His coming;
   and not only so, but holding Him fast and shewing Him to others.

   XI.  And now, having purified the theatre by what has been said, let us
   discourse a little about the Festival, and join in celebrating this
   Feast with festal and pious souls.  And, since the chief point of the
   Festival is the remembrance of God, let us call God to mind.  For I
   think that the sound of those who keep Festival There, where is the
   dwelling of all the Blissful, is nothing else than this, the hymns and
   praises of God, sung by all who are counted worthy of that City.  Let
   none be astonished if what I have to say contains some things that I
   have said before; for not only will I utter the same words, but I shall
   speak of the same subjects, trembling both in tongue and mind and
   thought when I speak of God for you too, that you may share this
   laudable and blessed feeling.  And when I speak of God you must be
   illumined at once by one flash of light and by three.  Three in
   Individualities or Hypostases, if any prefer so to call them, or
   persons, [3952] for we will not quarrel about names so long as the
   syllables amount to the same meaning; but One in respect of the
   Substance--that is, the Godhead.  For they are divided without
   division, if I may so say; and they are united in division.  For the
   Godhead is one in three, and the three are one, in whom the Godhead is,
   or to speak more accurately, Who are the Godhead.  Excesses and defects
   we will omit, neither making the Unity a confusion, nor the division a
   separation.  We would keep equally far from the confusion of Sabellius
   and from the division of Arius, which are evils diametrically opposed,
   yet equal in their wickedness.  For what need is there heretically to
   fuse God together, or to cut Him up into inequality?

   XII.  For to us there is but One God, the Father, of Whom are all
   things, and One Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom are all things; and One Holy
   Ghost, in Whom are all things; [3953] yet these words, of, by, in,
   whom, do not denote a difference of nature (for if this were the case,
   the three prepositions, or the order of the three names would never be
   altered), but they characterize the personalities of a nature which is
   one and unconfused.  And this is proved by the fact that They are again
   collected into one, if you will read--not carelessly--this other
   passage of the same Apostle, "Of Him and through Him and to Him are all
   things; to Him be glory forever, Amen." [3954]   The Father is Father,
   and is Unoriginate, for He is of no one; the Son is Son, and is not
   unoriginate, for He is of the Father.  But if you take the word Origin
   in a temporal sense, He too is Unoriginate, for He is the Maker of
   Time, and is not subject to Time.  The Holy Ghost is truly Spirit,
   coming forth from the Father indeed, but not after the manner of the
   Son, for it is not by Generation but by Procession (since I must coin a
   word for the sake of clearness [3955] ); for neither did the Father
   cease to be Unbegotten because of His begetting something, nor the Son
   to be begotten because He is of the Unbegotten (how could that be?),
   nor is the Spirit changed into Father or Son because He proceeds, or
   because He is God--though the ungodly do not believe it.  For
   Personality is unchangeable; else how could Personality remain, if it
   were changeable, and could be removed from one to another?  But they
   who make "Unbegotten" and "Begotten" natures of equivocal gods would
   perhaps make Adam and Seth differ in nature, since the former was not
   born of flesh (for he was created), but the latter was born of Adam and
   Eve.  There is then One God in Three, and These Three are One, as we
   have said.

   XIII.  Since then these things are so, or rather since This is so; and
   His Adoration ought not to be rendered only by Beings above, but there
   ought to be also worshippers on earth, that all things may be filled
   with the glory of God (forasmuch as they are filled with God Himself);
   therefore man was created and honored with the hand [3956] and Image of
   God.  But to despise man, when by the envy of the Devil and the bitter
   taste of sin he was pitiably severed from God his Maker--this was not
   in the Nature of God.  What then was done, and what is the great
   Mystery that concerns us?  An innovation is made upon nature, and God
   is made Man.  "He that rideth upon the Heaven of Heavens in the East"
   [3957] of His own glory and Majesty, is glorified in the West of our
   meanness and lowliness.  And the Son of God deigns to become and to be
   called Son of Man; not changing what He was (for It is unchangeable);
   but assuming what He was not (for He is full of love to man), that the
   Incomprehensible [3958] might be comprehended, conversing with us
   through the mediation of the Flesh as through a veil; since it was not
   possible for that nature which is subject to birth and decay to endure
   His unveiled Godhead.  Therefore the Unmingled is mingled; and not only
   is God mingled with birth and Spirit [3959] with flesh, and the Eternal
   with time, and the Uncircumscribed with measure; but also Generation
   with Virginity, and dishonour with Him who is higher than all honour;
   He who is impassible with Suffering, [3960] and the Immortal with the
   corruptible.  For since that Deceiver thought that he was unconquerable
   in his malice, after he had cheated us with the hope of becoming gods,
   he was himself cheated by God's assumption of our nature; so that in
   attacking Adam as he thought, he should really meet with God, and thus
   the new Adam should save the old, and the condemnation of the flesh
   should be abolished, death being slain by flesh.

   XIV.  At His birth we duly kept Festival, both I, the leader of the
   Feast, and you, and all that is in the world and above the world.  With
   the Star we ran, and with the Magi we worshipped, and with the
   Shepherds we were illuminated, and with the Angels we glorified Him,
   and with Simeon we took Him up in our arms, and with Anna the aged and
   chaste we made our responsive confession.  And thanks be to Him who
   came to His own in the guise of a stranger, because He glorified the
   stranger. [3961]   Now, we come to another action of Christ, and
   another mystery.  I cannot restrain my pleasure; I am rapt into God.
   Almost like John I proclaim good tidings; for though I be not a
   Forerunner, yet am I from the desert. [3962]   Christ is illumined, let
   us shine forth with Him.  Christ is baptized, let us descend with Him
   that we may also ascend with Him.  Jesus is baptized; but we must
   attentively consider not only this but also some other points.  Who is
   He, and by whom is He baptized, and at what time?  He is the All-pure;
   and He is baptized by John; and the time is the beginning of His
   miracles.  What are we to learn and to be taught by this?  To purify
   ourselves first; to be lowly minded; and to preach only in maturity
   both of spiritual and bodily stature.  The first [3963] has a word
   especially for those who rush to Baptism off hand, and without due
   preparation, or providing for the stability of the Baptismal Grace by
   the disposition of their minds to good.  For since Grace contains
   remission of the past (for it is a grace), it is on that account more
   worthy of reverence, that we return not to the same vomit again.  The
   second speaks to those who rebel against the Stewards of this Mystery,
   if they are their superiors in rank.  The third is for those who are
   confident in their youth, and think that any time is the right one to
   teach or to preside.  Jesus is purified, and dost thou despise
   purification?...and by John, and dost thou rise up against thy
   herald?...and at thirty years of age, and dost thou before thy beard
   has grown presume to teach the aged, or believe that thou teachest
   them, though thou be not reverend on account of thine age, or even
   perhaps for thy character?  But here it may be said, Daniel, and this
   or that other, were judges in their youth, and examples are on your
   tongues; for every wrongdoer is prepared to defend himself.  But I
   reply that that which is rare is not the law of the Church.  For one
   swallow does not make a summer, nor one line a geometrician, nor one
   voyage a sailor.

   XV.  But John baptizes, Jesus comes to Him [3964] ...perhaps to
   sanctify the Baptist himself, but certainly to bury the whole of the
   old Adam in the water; and before this and for the sake of this, to
   sanctify Jordan; for as He is Spirit and Flesh, so He consecrates us by
   Spirit and water. [3965]   John will not receive Him; Jesus contends.
   "I have need to be baptized of Thee" [3966] says the Voice to the Word,
   the Friend to the Bridegroom; [3967] he that is above all among them
   that are born of women, [3968] to Him Who is the Firstborn of every
   creature; [3969] he that leaped in the womb, [3970] to Him Who was
   adored in the womb; he who was and is to be the Forerunner [3971] to
   Him Who was and is to be manifested.  "I have need to be baptized of
   Thee;" add to this "and for Thee;" for he knew that he would be
   baptized by Martyrdom, or, like Peter, that he would be cleansed not
   only as to his feet. [3972]   "And comest Thou to me?"  This also was
   prophetic; for he knew that after Herod would come the madness of
   Pilate, and so that when he had gone before Christ would follow him.
   But what saith Jesus?  "Suffer it to be so now," for this is the time
   of His Incarnation; for He knew that yet a little while and He should
   baptize the Baptist.  And what is the "Fan?"  The Purification.  And
   what is the "Fire?"  The consuming of the chaff, and the heat of the
   Spirit.  And what the "Axe?"  The excision of the soul which is
   incurable even after the dung. [3973]   And what the Sword?  The
   cutting of the Word, which separates the worse from the better, [3974]
   and makes a division between the faithful and the unbeliever; [3975]
   and stirs up the son and the daughter and the bride against the father
   and the mother and the mother in law, [3976] the young and fresh
   against the old and shadowy.  And what is the Latchet of the shoe,
   which thou John who baptizest Jesus mayest not loose? [3977] thou who
   art of the desert, and hast no food, the new Elias, [3978] the more
   than Prophet, inasmuch as thou sawest Him of Whom thou didst prophesy,
   thou Mediator of the Old and New Testaments.  What is this?  Perhaps
   the Message of the Advent, and the Incarnation, of which not the least
   point may be loosed, I say not by those [3979] who are yet carnal and
   babes in Christ, but not even by those who are like John in spirit.

   XVI.  But further--Jesus goeth up out of the water...for with Himself
   He carries up the world...and sees the heaven opened which Adam had
   shut against himself and all his posterity, [3980] as the gates of
   Paradise by the flaming sword.  And the Spirit bears witness to His
   Godhead, for he descends upon One that is like Him, as does the Voice
   from Heaven (for He to Whom the witness is borne came from thence), and
   like a Dove, for He honours the Body (for this also was God, through
   its union with God) by being seen in a bodily form; and moreover, the
   Dove has from distant ages been wont to proclaim the end of the Deluge.
   [3981]   But if you are to judge of Godhead by bulk and weight, and the
   Spirit seems to you a small thing because He came in the form of a
   Dove, O man of contemptible littleness of thought concerning the
   greatest of things, you must also to be consistent despise the Kingdom
   of Heaven, because it is compared to a grain of mustard seed; [3982]
   and you must exalt the adversary above the Majesty of Jesus, because he
   is called a great Mountain, [3983] and Leviathan [3984] and King of
   that which lives in the water, whereas Christ is called the Lamb,
   [3985] and the Pearl, [3986] and the Drop [3987] and similar names.

   XVII.  Now, since our Festival is of Baptism, and we must endure a
   little hardness with Him Who for our sake took form, and was baptized,
   and was crucified; let us speak about the different kinds of Baptism,
   that we may come out thence purified.  Moses baptized [3988] but it was
   in water, and before that in the cloud and in the sea. [3989]   This
   was typical as Paul saith; the Sea of the water, and the Cloud of the
   Spirit; the Manna, of the Bread of Life; the Drink, of the Divine
   Drink.  John also baptized; but this was not like the baptism of the
   Jews, for it was not only in water, but also "unto repentance."  Still
   it was not wholly spiritual, for he does not add "And in the Spirit."
   Jesus also baptized, but in the Spirit.  This is the perfect Baptism.
   And how is He not God, if I may digress a little, by whom you too are
   made God?  I know also a Fourth Baptism--that by Martyrdom and blood,
   which also Christ himself underwent:--and this one is far more august
   than all the others, inasmuch as it cannot be defiled by after-stains.
   Yes, and I know of a Fifth also, which is that of tears, and is much
   more laborious, received by him who washes his bed every night and his
   couch with tears; [3990] whose bruises stink through his wickedness;
   [3991] and who goeth mourning and of a sad countenance; who imitates
   the repentance of Manasseh [3992] and the humiliation of the Ninevites
   [3993] upon which God had mercy; who utters the words of the Publican
   in the Temple, and is justified rather than the stiff-necked Pharisee;
   [3994] who like the Canaanite woman bends down and asks for mercy and
   crumbs, the food of a dog that is very hungry. [3995]

   XVIII.  I, however, for I confess myself to be a man,--that is to say,
   an animal shifty and of a changeable nature,--both eagerly receive this
   Baptism, and worship Him Who has given it me, and impart it to others;
   and by shewing mercy make provision for mercy.  For I know that I too
   am compassed with infirmity, [3996] and that with what measure I mete
   it shall be measured to me again. [3997]   But what sayest thou, O new
   Pharisee pure [3998] in title but not in intention, who dischargest
   upon us the sentiments of Novatus, [3999] though thou sharest the same
   infirmities?  Wilt thou not give any place to weeping?  Wilt thou shed
   no tear?  Mayest thou not meet with a Judge like thyself?  Art thou not
   ashamed by the mercy of Jesus, Who took our infirmities and bare our
   sicknesses; [4000] Who came not to call the righteous but sinners to
   repentance; [4001] Who will have mercy rather than sacrifice; who
   forgiveth sins till seventy times seven. [4002]   How blessed would
   your exaltation be if it really were purity, not pride, making laws
   above the reach of men, and destroying improvement by despair.  For
   both are alike evil, indulgence not regulated by prudence, and
   condemnation that will never forgive; the one because it relaxes all
   reins, the other because it strangles by its severity.  Shew me your
   purity, and I will approve your boldness.  But as it is, I fear that
   being full of sores you will render them incurable.  Will you not admit
   even David's repentance, to whom his penitence preserved even the gift
   of prophecy? nor the great Peter himself, who fell into human weakness
   at the Passion of our Saviour?  Yet Jesus received him, and by the
   threefold question and confession healed the threefold denial. [4003]
   Or will you even refuse to admit that he was made perfect by blood (for
   your folly goes even as far as that)?  Or the transgressor at Corinth?
   But Paul confirmed love towards him when he saw his amendment, and
   gives the reason, "that such an one be not swallowed up by overmuch
   sorrow," [4004] being overwhelmed by the excess of the punishment.
   [4005]   And will you refuse to grant liberty of marriage to young
   widows on account of the liability of their age to fall?  Paul ventured
   to do so; but of course you can teach him; for you have been caught up
   to the Fourth heaven, and to another Paradise, and have heard words
   more unspeakable, and comprehend a larger circle in your Gospel.

   XIX.  But these sins were not after Baptism, you will say.  Where is
   your proof?  Either prove it--or refrain from condemning; and if there
   be any doubt, let charity prevail.  But Novatus, you say, would not
   receive those who lapsed in the persecution.  What do you mean by
   this?  If they were unrepentant he was right; I too would refuse to
   receive those who either would not stoop at all or not sufficiently,
   and who would refuse to make their amendment counterbalance their sin;
   and when I do receive them, I will assign them their proper place;
   [4006] but if he refused those who wore themselves away with weeping, I
   will not imitate him.  And why should Novatus's want of charity be a
   rule for me?  He never punished covetousness, which is a second
   idolatry; but he condemned fornication as though he himself were not
   flesh and body.  What say you?  Are we convincing you by these words?
   Come and stand here on our side, that is, on the side of humanity.  Let
   us magnify the Lord together.  Let none of you, even though he has much
   confidence in himself, dare to say, Touch me not for I am pure, and who
   is so pure as I?  Give us too a share in your brightness.  But perhaps
   we are not convincing you?  Then we will weep for you.  Let these men
   then if they will, follow our way, which is Christ's way; but if they
   will not, let them go their own.  Perhaps in it they will be baptized
   with Fire, in that last Baptism which is more painful and longer, which
   devours wood like grass, [4007] and consumes the stubble of every evil.

   XX.  But let us venerate to-day the Baptism of Christ; and let us keep
   the feast well, not in pampering the belly, but rejoicing in spirit.
   And how shall we luxuriate?  "Wash you, make you clean." [4008]   If ye
   be scarlet with sin and less bloody, be made white as snow; if ye be
   red, and men bathed in blood, yet be ye brought to the whiteness of
   wool.  Anyhow be purified, and you shall be clean (for God rejoices in
   nothing so much as in the amendment and salvation of man, on whose
   behalf is every discourse and every Sacrament), that you may be like
   lights in the world, a quickening force to all other men; that you may
   stand as perfect lights beside That great Light, and may learn the
   mystery of the illumination of Heaven, enlightened by the Trinity more
   purely and clearly, of Which even now you are receiving in a measure
   the One Ray from the One Godhead in Christ Jesus our Lord; to Whom be
   the glory and the might for ever and ever.  Amen.

   [3917] I.e. Zeus, who was said by some to be a deified man, once tyrant
   of Crete, where his tomb was shown.

   [3918] The allusion is to the birth of Zeus.  Kronos the Titan, father
   of the gods, was the husband of Rhea, who bore him children.  But an
   oracle having declared that Kronos should be dethroned by his children,
   he swallowed them immediately after they were born.  Rhea, however, on
   the birth of Zeus, aided by the Curetes, a wild band of Cretan Priests,
   concealed the child, and substituted a stone, which Kronos swallowed in
   his haste without perceiving the difference.  The stone made him very
   sick, and he vomited forth the children whom he had previously
   swallowed; and by them and Zeus the prophecy was fulfilled.  Kronos was
   deposed and imprisoned in Tartarus.

   [3919] There was a temple of Rhea in Phrygia, in which at her festivals
   people mutilated themselves to do her honour.  The flutes alluded to
   served to turn the thoughts of the sufferers from the pain of the
   operation.  The Corybantes were the ministers of the goddess, who led
   the wild orgies of her worship.  It is believed that there is an
   allusion to this practice of self-mutilation in Galat. v. 12.  So at
   least S. Jerome, S. Ambrose, and all the Greek Fathers take the
   passage.  S. Thomas Aquinas, understanding the word in the same sense,
   applies it mystically; and Estius, who here follows Erasmus, refers the
   "cutting off" merely to excommunication, a sense which he calls
   "Apostolico sensu dignior," though why "dignior" it is not easy to
   see.  Yet he acknowledges that those who interpret it literally do so
   "non immerito."

   [3920] The mythus of the Rape of Persephone and its consequences.

   [3921] Dionysus was said to have been born from the thigh of Zeus, as
   Athene to have sprung full-grown and armed at all points from his head.

   [3922] These myths and practices are too shameful to be described.

   [3923] See the Iphigenia In Tauris of Euripides.

   [3924] It was a custom of the Spartans that at their great festival of
   Artemis the youths who were just coming of age (Ephebi) should scourge
   themselves cruelly on her altar in honour of the goddess, and to prove
   their manhood.

   [3925] The gods came to dine with Tantalus, and he, to do them honour,
   boiled his son Pelops for their food.  They, however, found it out, and
   restored him to life; not, however, before Demeter had unwittingly
   eaten his shoulder, in the place of which they substituted one of
   ivory.

   [3926] S. Jerome, commenting on Isaiah xli. 22, says:  "Why could they
   never predict anything concerning Christ and His Apostles, or the ruin
   and destruction of their own temples?  If then they could not foretell
   their own destruction, how can they foretell anything good or bad?"

   [3927] These Mysteries were of Persian origin, connected it is said
   with the worship of the Sun.  The neophytes were made to undergo twelve
   different kinds of torture.

   [3928] The Egyptian Mysteries.

   [3929] Zeus fell in love with Isis, and carried her off in the form of
   a heifer.  Here, discovering the fraud, sent a gadfly, which drove Isis
   mad.

   [3930] Apis, the sacred bull, worshipped at Memphis.

   the annual rise of the River.

   [3932] Rom. i. 27.

   [3933] cf. Orat. in Theoph. c. 12.  The explanation seems to be, that
   the "Knowledge of good and evil" was a necessary part of the
   development of man's intellect, but that a premature attempt to attain
   it per saltum instead of by a gradual progress would prove fatal.  Had
   human nature gone through its originally intended educational stages,
   it might have reached to the knowledge of evil without having that
   knowledge alloyed and deteriorated by the experience of evil, but might
   have known it, as God does, without taint.  (Blount, Ann. Bible on Gen.

   [3952] The sense of Person (here prosopon), which is the usual
   post-Nicene equivalent of hupostasis, was by no means generally
   attached to that word during the first Four Centuries, though here and
   there there are traces of such a use.  Throughout the Arian controversy
   a great deal of trouble and misunderstanding was caused by the want of
   a precise definition of the meaning of hupostasis.  It seems to have
   been at first understood by the Eastern Church to mean Real Personal
   Existence--Reality being the fundamental idea.  In this fundamental
   sense it was used in Theology as expressing the distinct individuality
   and relative bearing of the Three "Persons" of the Blessed Trinity to
   each other (to idion para to koinon, Suidas).  But Arius gave it a
   heretical twist, and said that there are Three Hypostases, in the sense
   of Natures or Substances; and this doctrine was anathematized by the
   Nicene Council, which, apparently regarding the term hupostasis as
   exactly equivalent to ousia (as Arius tried to make it) condemned the
   proposition that the Son is ex heteras hupostaseos e ousias (Symb.
   Nic.).  Similar is the use of the word in S. Athanasius.  As against
   Sabellius, however, who taught that in the Godhead there are tria
   prosopa (using this word in the sense of Aspects only) but would not
   allow treis hupostaseis (i.e., Self-existent Personalities), the
   post-Nicene Church regarded hupostasis as designating the Person, and
   spoke freely of treis hupostaseis.  The Western Church increased the
   confusion by continuing to regard hupostasis as equivalent to ousia,
   and translating it by Substantia or Subsistentia.  It was not till the
   word Essentia came into use to express ousia that the Western Church
   grasped the difference, so long accepted in the East, so as to use the
   words accurately.  Meantime, however, there would seem to have grown up
   a difference in the use of the two words supposed to represent
   hupostasis, of the same kind as that between hupostasis and ousia;
   Substantia being appropriated to the Essence of a thing, that which is
   the foundation of its being; while Subsistentia came rather to connote
   a limitation, i.e., Personality.  Thus the West also became confused,
   and Substantia was held to be the true equivalent of hupostasis.  Hence
   the condemnation at Sardica (a.d. 347) by the Western Bishops of the
   doctrine of Three Hypostases as Arian.  The confusion lasted long, but
   in 362 a Council was held at Alexandria, when this difference was seen
   to be a mere logomachy, and it was pronounced orthodox to confess
   either treis hupostaseis in the sense of "Persons," or mian hupostasin
   in that of "Substance."  Our author in his Oration to the Fathers of
   the Council of Constantinople fully acknowledges this.  "What do you
   mean," he says, "by hupostaseis or prosopa?  You mean that the Three
   are distinct, not in Nature, but in Personality."  And in the Panegyric
   on S. Athanasius (Or. xxi. c. 35), he remarks on the orthodoxy of the
   phrase mia ousia, treis hupostaseis, that the first expression refers
   to the Nature of the Godhead, the second to the special properties of
   the Persons.  With this, he says, the Italians agree, but the poverty
   of their language is such that it does not admit of the distinction
   between ousia and hupostasis, and therefore has to call in the word
   prosopon, which if misunderstood is liable to be charged with
   Sabellianism.

   [3953] 2 Cor. viii. 6.

   [3954] Rom. xi. 36.

   [3955] The Coining is simply of the adverbial form; the Substantive is
   found in earlier writings.  S. Gregory himself uses it Orat. Theol. V.
   He uses other words also, as ekpempsis, proodos, and the verbs
   proerchesthai, proienai. As to the question of the Double Procession
   (Filioque) see Introd. to Orat. Theol. V.  Dr. Swete (Doctr. of H. S.
   p. 118) says, "It is instructive to notice how at this period the two
   great Sees of Rome and Constantinople seem to have agreed in abstaining
   from a minuter definition of the Procession.  Both in East and West the
   relations of the Spirit to the Son were being examined by individual
   theologians; but S. Gregory and S. Damasus appear to have alike
   refrained from entering upon a question which did not touch the
   essentials of the Faith."  He adds in a note "This is the more
   remarkable because Damasus was of Spanish origin."

   [3956] "The rest of the Creation was made by the command of God, but
   Man was formed by the hand of God."  (Wordsworth in Gen. ii. 7.) "There
   was a peculiar glory in the creation of Man, distinguishing him from
   the rest of the creatures.  The creatures inferior to man were called
   into being by a simple act of the Divine Will; but in the case of man,
   bearing as he does the nature and the form which God was about to
   assume as His own, and which, once assumed, was never again to be laid
   aside, the process of creation was markedly different.  Then for the
   first time the Most Holy Persons of the Blessed Trinity appear upon the
   scene.  They are manifested as in mutual consultation and common action
   personally engaged....Let Us make Man in Our Image after Our
   Likeness'...Then followed the exercise of creative power as a personal
   act, the putting forth the Hand of God to fashion the body of Man; The
   Lord God formed Man of the dust of the earth.'  Afterwards came the yet
   higher work in the infusion of the immaterial invisible life enshrined
   in the body, perfecting the work of God; He breathed into his nostrils
   the breath of life and Man became a living soul.'"  (T. T. Carter, The
   Divine Dispensations, p. 44.)

   [3957] Ps. lxviii. 4.

   [3958] Ullman comments on this passage as follows:  There is in it, as
   follows especially from what comes after, the double sense that the
   Infinite Godhead entered in Christ into the limitations of a finite
   human life; and in consequence of this, since otherwise as an infinite
   Being it was not fully cognisable by the finite human soul, became in
   this limitation cognisable in some degree to it, as it was not before
   this special manifestation in Christ.

   [3959] "In this and several places pneuma and nous evidently denote the
   Divine the Spiritual, taken in the highest and purest sense, in which
   it is lifted above the sarx, and generally above all that is material;
   in which sense S. John says, pneuma ho theos."  Ullmann.

   [3960] "In a double sense;--either that the Godhead is, in union with
   the Man Jesus, subjected to suffering (cf. Or. XXI. 24), or that the
   Divine Substance, which is unapproachable by any passion or suffering,
   combined itself with a Man, whose nature cannot be free from such
   emotions."  Ullmann.

   [3961] i.e., human nature, which was severed from and made hostile to
   God by sin.

   [3962] i.e., Sasima.

   [3963] That the All-pure was baptized is to remind us of our need of
   preparation.  That He was baptized by John is to teach us humility
   towards the Priesthood, even if the Priest be socially our inferior.
   That He was baptized at thirty years of age shews that the Teachers and
   Rulers of the Church ought not to be very young men.  Scholiast.

   [3998] The Novatians were known as Cathari or Puritans.

   [3999] In a.d. 251 Novatus, a Presbyter of the Church of Carthage, who
   with others had formed a party against S. Cyprian, their Bishop, came
   to Rome, and excited Novatian to become leader in a similar schism
   against Cornelius, the recently elected Bishop of the Apostolic See.
   The plea urged on behalf of the schism was that Cornelius, who was of
   one accord with Cyprian, had lapsed in the time of the persecution
   under Decius, a.d. 250, and that he had relaxed the discipline of the
   Church by admitting to Communion on too easy terms those who had been
   guilty of a similar offence; and that therefore he ought not to be
   recognized as a true Bishop of the Church, but a faithful Pastor should
   be chosen in his place.  Consequently Novatian was elected by some who
   held these views, and was consecrated by three Bishops.  There seem to
   have been a good many of his followers in Constantinople at this time.
   There had been at one time a disposition among them to reunite
   themselves to the Catholic Church, for they were orthodox in faith; but
   it had been hindered by the malevolence of their party leaders; so that
   the schism continued, and the Novatians must be added to the opponents
   with whom S. Gregory had to deal.

   Oration XL.

   The Oration on Holy Baptism.

   Preached at Constantinople Jan. 6, 381, being the day following the
   delivery of that on the Holy Lights.

   I.  Yesterday we kept high Festival on the illustrious Day of the Holy
   Lights; for it was fitting that rejoicings should be kept for our
   Salvation, and that far more than for weddings and birthdays, and
   namedays, and house-warmings, and registrations of children, and
   anniversaries, and all the other festivities that men observe for their
   earthly friends.  And now to-day let us discourse briefly concerning
   Baptism, and the benefits which accrue to us therefrom, even though our
   discourse yesterday spoke of it cursorily; partly because the time
   pressed us hard, and partly because the sermon had to avoid
   tediousness.  For too great length in a sermon is as much an enemy to
   people's ears, as too much food is to their bodies....It will be worth
   your while to apply your minds to what we say, and to receive our
   discourse on so important a subject not perfunctorily, but with ready
   mind, since to know the power of this Sacrament is itself
   Enlightenment. [4009]

   II.  The Word recognizes three Births for us; namely, the natural
   birth, that of Baptism, and that of the Resurrection.  Of these the
   first is by night, and is servile, and involves passion; but the second
   is by day, and is destructive of passion, cutting off all the veil
   [4010] that is derived from birth, and leading on to the higher life;
   and the third is more terrible and shorter, bringing together in a
   moment all mankind, [4011] to stand before its Creator, and to give an
   account of its service and conversation here; whether it has followed
   the flesh, or whether it has mounted up with the spirit, and worshipped
   the grace of its new creation.  My Lord Jesus Christ has showed that He
   honoured all these births in His own Person; the first, by that first
   and quickening Inbreathing; [4012] the second by His Incarnation and
   the Baptism wherewith He Himself was baptized; and the third by the
   Resurrection of which He was the Firstfruits; condescending, as He
   became the Firstborn [4013] among many brethren, so also to become the
   Firstborn from the dead. [4014]

   III.  Concerning two of these births, the first and the last, we have
   not to speak on the present occasion.  Let us discourse upon the
   second, which is now necessary for us, and which gives its name to the
   Feast of the Lights.  Illumination is the splendour of souls, the
   conversion of the life, the question put to the Godward conscience.
   [4015]   It is the aid to our weakness, the renunciation of the flesh,
   the following of the Spirit, the fellowship of the Word, the
   improvement of the creature, the overwhelming of sin, the participation
   of light, the dissolution of darkness.  It is the carriage to God, the
   dying with Christ, the perfecting of the mind, the bulwark of Faith,
   the key of the Kingdom of heaven, the change of life, the removal of
   slavery, the loosing of chains, the remodelling of the whole man.  Why
   should I go into further detail?  Illumination is the greatest and most
   magnificent of the Gifts of God.  For just as we speak of the Holy of
   Holies, and the Song of Songs, as more comprehensive and more excellent
   than others, so is this called Illumination, as being more holy than
   any other illumination which we possess.

   IV.  And as Christ the Giver of it is called by many various names, so
   too is this Gift, whether it is from the exceeding gladness of its
   nature (as those who are very fond of a thing take pleasure in using
   its name), or that the great variety of its benefits has reacted for us
   upon its names.  We call it, the Gift, the Grace, Baptism, Unction,
   Illumination, the Clothing of Immortality, the Laver of Regeneration,
   the Seal, and everything that is honourable.  We call it the Gift,
   because it is given to us in return for nothing on our part; Grace,
   because it is conferred even on debtors; Baptism, because sin is buried
   with it in the water; Unction, as Priestly and Royal, for such were
   they who were anointed; Illumination, because of its splendour;
   Clothing, because it hides our shame; the Laver, because it washes us;
   the Seal because it preserves us, and is moreover the indication of
   Dominion.  In it the heavens rejoice; it is glorified by Angels,
   because of its kindred splendour.  It is the image of the heavenly
   bliss.  We long indeed to sing out its praises, but we cannot worthily
   do so.

   V.  God is Light: [4016]   the highest, the unapproachable, the
   ineffable, That can neither be conceived in the mind nor uttered with
   the lips, [4017] That giveth life to every reasoning creature. [4018]
   He is in the world of thought, what the sun is in the world of sense;
   presenting Himself to our minds in proportion as we are cleansed; and
   loved in proportion as He is presented to our mind; and again,
   conceived in proportion as we love Him; Himself contemplating and
   comprehending Himself, and pouring Himself out upon what is external to
   Him.  That Light, I mean, which is contemplated in the Father and the
   Son and the Holy Ghost, Whose riches is Their unity of nature, and the
   one outleaping of Their brightness.  A second Light is the Angel, a
   kind of outflow or communication of that first Light, drawing its
   illumination from its inclination and obedience thereto; and I know not
   whether its illumination is distributed according to the order of its
   state, or whether its order is due to the respective measures of its
   illumination. [4019]   A third Light is man; a light which is visible
   to external objects.  For they call man light [4020] because of the
   faculty of speech in us.  And the name is applied again to those of us
   who are more like God, and who approach God more nearly than others.  I
   also acknowledge another Light, by which the primeval darkness was
   driven away or pierced.  It was the first of all the visible creation
   to be called into existence; and it irradiates the whole universe, the
   circling orbit of the stars, and all the heavenly beacon fires.

   VI.  Light was also the firstborn commandment given to the firstborn
   man (for the commandment of the Law is a lamp and a light; [4021] and
   again, Because Thy judgments are a light upon the earth); [4022]
   although the envious darkness crept in and wrought wickedness.  And a
   Light typical and proportionate to those who were its subjects was the
   written law, adumbrating the truth and the sacrament of the great
   Light, for Moses' face was made glorious by it. [4023]   And, to
   mention more Lights--it was Light that appeared out of Fire to Moses,
   when it burned the bush indeed, but did not consume it, [4024] to shew
   its nature and to declare the power that was in it.  And it was Light
   that was in the pillar of fire that led Israel and tamed the
   wilderness. [4025]   It was Light that carried up Elias in the car of
   fire, [4026] and yet did not burn him as it carried him.  It was Light
   that shone round the Shepherds [4027] when the Eternal Light was
   mingled with the temporal.  It was Light that was the beauty of the
   Star that went before to Bethlehem to guide the Wise Men's way, [4028]
   and to be the escort of the Light That is above us, when He came
   amongst us.  Light was That Godhead Which was shewn upon the Mount to
   the disciples--and a little too strong for their eyes. [4029]   Light
   was That Vision which blazed out upon Paul, [4030] and by wounding his
   eyes healed the darkness of his soul.  Light is also the brilliancy of
   heaven to those who have been purified here, when the righteous shall
   shine forth as the Sun, [4031] and God shall stand in the midst of
   them, [4032] gods and kings, deciding and distinguishing the ranks of
   the Blessedness of heaven.  Light beside these in a special sense is
   the illumination of Baptism of which we are now speaking; for it
   contains a great and marvellous sacrament of our salvation.

   VII.  For since to be utterly sinless belongs to God, and to the first
   and uncompounded nature (for simplicity is peaceful, and not subject to
   dissension), and I venture to say also that it belongs to the Angelic
   nature too; or at least, I would affirm that nature to be very nearly
   sinless, because of its nearness to God; but to sin is human and
   belongs to the Compound on earth (for composition is the beginning of
   separation); therefore the master did not think it right to leave His
   creature unaided, or to neglect its danger of separation from Himself;
   but on the contrary, just as He gave existence to that which did not
   exist, so He gave new creation to that which did exist, a diviner
   creation and a loftier than the first, which is to those who are
   beginning life a Seal, and to those who are more mature in age both a
   gift and a restoration of the image which had fallen through sin, that
   we may not, by becoming worse through despair, and ever being borne
   downward to that which is more evil, fall altogether from good and from
   virtue, through despondency; and having fallen into a depth of evil (as
   it is said) despise Him; [4033] but that like those who in the course
   of a long journey make a brief rest from labour at an inn, we should be
   enabled to accomplish the rest of the road fresh and full of courage.
   Such is the grace and power of baptism; not an overwhelming of the
   world as of old, but a purification of the sins of each individual, and
   a complete cleansing from all the bruises and stains of sin.

   VIII.  And since we are double-made, I mean of body and soul, and the
   one part is visible, the other invisible, so the cleansing also is
   twofold, by water and the spirit; the one received visibly in the body,
   the other concurring with it invisibly and apart from the body; the one
   typical, the other real and cleansing the depths.  And this which comes
   to the aid of our first birth, makes us new instead of old, and like
   God instead of what we now are; recasting us without fire, and creating
   us anew without breaking us up.  For, to say it all in one word, the
   virtue of Baptism is to be understood as a covenant with God for a
   second life and a purer conversation.  And indeed all need to fear this
   very much, and to watch our own souls, each one of us, with all care,
   that we do not become liars in respect of this profession.  For if God
   is called upon as a Mediator to ratify human professions, how great is
   the danger if we be found transgressors of the covenant which we have
   made with God Himself; and if we be found guilty before the Truth
   Himself of that lie, besides our other transgressions...and that when
   there is no second regeneration, or recreation, or restoration to our
   former state, even though we seek it with all our might, and with many
   sighs and tears, by which it is cicatrized over (with great difficulty
   in my opinion, though we all believe that it may be cicatrized).  Yet
   if we might wipe away even the scars I should be glad, since I too have
   need of mercy.  But it is better not to stand in need of a second
   cleansing, but to stop at the first, which is, I know, common to all,
   and involves no labour, and is of equal price to slaves, to masters, to
   poor, to rich, to humble, to exalted, to gentle, to simple, to debtors,
   to those who are free from debt; like the breathing of the air, and the
   pouring forth of the light, and the changes of the seasons, and the
   sight of creation, that great delight which we all share alike, and the
   equal distribution of the faith.

   IX.  For it is a strange thing to substitute for a painless remedy one
   which is more painful; to cast away the grace of mercy, and owe a debt
   of punishment; and to measure our amendment against sin.  For how many
   tears must we contribute before they can equal the fount of baptism;
   and who will be surety for us that death shall wait for our cure, and
   that the judgment seat shall not summon us while still debtors, and
   needing the fire of the other world?  You perhaps, as a good and
   pitiful husbandman, will entreat the Master still to spare the figtree,
   [4034] and not yet to cut it down, though accused of unfruitfulness;
   but to allow you to put dung about it in the shape of tears, sighs,
   invocations, sleepings on the ground, vigils, mortifications of soul
   and body, and correction by confession and a life of humiliation.  But
   it is uncertain if the Master will spare it, inasmuch as it cumbers the
   ground of another asking for mercy, and becoming deteriorated by the
   longsuffering shewn to this one.  Let us then be buried with Christ by
   Baptism, [4035] that we may also rise with Him; let us descend with
   Him, that we may also be exalted with Him; let us ascend with Him, that
   we may also be glorified together.

   X.  If after baptism the persecutor and tempter of the light assail you
   (for he assailed even the Word my God through the veil, [4036] the
   hidden Light through that which was manifested), you have the means to
   conquer him.  Fear not the conflict; defend yourself with the Water;
   defend yourself with the Spirit, by Which all the fiery darts of the
   wicked shall be quenched. [4037]   It is Spirit, but That Spirit which
   rent the Mountains. [4038]   It is Water, but that which quenches
   fire.  If he assail you by your want (as he dared to assail Christ),
   and asks that stones should be made bread, do not be ignorant of his
   devices. [4039]   Teach him what he has not learnt.  Defend yourself
   with the Word of life, Who is the Bread sent down from heaven, and
   giving life to the world. [4040]   If he plot against you with vain
   glory (as he did against Christ when he led Him up to the pinnacle of
   the temple and said to Him, Cast Thyself down [4041] as a proof of Thy
   Godhead), be not overborne by elation.  If you be taken by this he will
   not stop here.  For he is insatiable, he grasps at every thing.  He
   fawns upon you with fair pretences, but he ends in evil; this is the
   manner of his fighting.  Yes, and the robber is skilled in Scripture.
   On the one side was that It is written about the Bread, and on the
   other that it Is written about the Angels.  It is written, quoth he, He
   shall give His Angels charge concerning thee, and they shall bear thee
   in their hands. [4042]   O vile sophist! how was it that thou didst
   suppress the words that follow, for I know it well, even if thou
   passest it by in silence?  I will make thee to go upon the asp and
   basilisk, and I will tread upon serpents and scorpions, being fenced by
   the Trinity.  If he wrestle against thee to a fall through avarice,
   shewing thee all the Kingdoms at one instant and in the twinkling of an
   eye, as belonging to himself, and demand thy worship, despise him as a
   beggar.  Say to him relying on the Seal, "I am myself the Image of God;
   I have not yet been cast down from the heavenly Glory, as thou wast
   through thy pride; I have put on Christ; I have been transformed into
   Christ by Baptism; worship thou me."  Well do I know that he will
   depart, defeated and put to shame by this; as he did from Christ the
   first Light, so he will from those who are illumined by Christ.  Such
   blessings does the laver bestow on those who apprehend it; such is the
   rich feast which it provides for those who hunger aright.

   XI.  Let us then be baptized that we may win the victory; let us
   partake of the cleansing waters, more purifying than hyssop, purer than
   the legal blood, more sacred than the ashes of the heifer sprinkling
   the unclean, [4043] and providing a temporary cleansing of the body,
   but not a complete taking away of sin; for if once purged, why should
   they need further purification?  Let us be baptized today, that we
   suffer not violence [4044] to-morrow; and let us not put off the
   blessing as if it were an injury, nor wait till we get more wicked that
   more may be forgiven us; and let us not become sellers and traffickers
   of Christ, lest we become more heavily burdened than we are able to
   bear, that we be not sunk with all hands [4045] and make shipwreck of
   the Gift, and lose all because we expected too much.  While thou art
   still master of thy thoughts run to the Gift.  While thou art not yet
   sick in body or in mind, nor seemest so to those who are with thee
   (though thou art really of sound mind); while thy good is not yet in
   the power of others, but thou thyself art still master of it; while thy
   tongue is not stammering or parched, or (to say no more) deprived of
   the power of pronouncing the sacramental words; while thou canst still
   be made one of the faithful, not conjecturally but confessedly; and
   canst still receive not pity but congratulation; while the Gift is
   still clear to thee, and there is no doubt about it; while the grace
   can reach the depth of thy soul, and it is not merely thy body that is
   washed for burial; and before tears surround thee announcing thy
   decease--and even these restrained perhaps for thy sake--and thy wife
   and children would delay thy departure, and are listening for thy dying
   words; before the physician is powerless to help thee, and is giving
   thee but hours to live--hours which are not his to give--and is
   balancing thy salvation with the nod of his head, and discoursing
   learnedly on thy disease after thou art dead, or making his charges
   heavier by withdrawals, or hinting at despair; before there is a
   struggle between the man who would baptize thee and the man who seeks
   thy money, the one striving that thou mayest receive thy Viaticum, the
   other that he may be inscribed in thy Will as heir--and there is no
   time for both.

   XII.  Why wait for a fever to bring you this blessing, and refuse it
   from God?  Why will you have it through lapse of time, and not through
   reason?  Why will you owe it to a plotting friend, and not to a saving
   desire?  Why will you receive it of force and not of free will; of
   necessity rather than of liberty?  Why must you hear of your death from
   another, rather than think of it as even now present?  Why do you seek
   for drugs which will do no good, or the sweat of the crisis, when the
   sweat of death is perhaps upon you?  Heal yourself before your
   extremity; have pity upon yourself the only true healer of your
   disease; apply to yourself the really saving medicine; while you are
   still sailing with a favouring breeze fear shipwreck, and you will be
   in less danger of it, if you make use of your terror as a helper.  Give
   yourself occasion to celebrate the Gift with feasting, not with
   mourning; let the talent be cultivated, not buried in the ground; let
   some time intervene between the grace and death, that not only may the
   account of sins be wiped out, but something better may be written in
   its place; that you may have not only the Gift, but also the Reward;
   that you may not only escape the fire, but may also inherit the glory,
   which is bestowed by cultivation of the Gift.  For to men of little
   soul it is a great thing to escape torment; but men of great soul aim
   also at attaining reward.

   XIII.  I know of three classes among the saved; the slaves, the hired
   servants, the sons.  If you are a slave, be afraid of the whip; if you
   are a hired servant, look only to receive your hire; if you are more
   than this, a son, revere Him as a Father, and work that which is good,
   because it is good to obey a Father; and even though no reward should
   come of it for you, this is itself a reward, that you please your
   Father.  Let us then take care not to despise these things.  How absurd
   it would be to grasp at money and throw away health; and to be lavish
   of the cleansing of the body, but economical over the cleansing of the
   soul; and to seek for freedom from earthly slavery, but not to care
   about heavenly freedom; and to make every effort to be splendidly
   housed and dressed, but to have never a thought how you yourself may
   become really very precious; and to be zealous to do good to others,
   without any desire to do good to yourself.  And if good could be
   bought, you would spare no money; but if mercy is freely at your feet,
   you despise it for its cheapness.  Every time is suitable for your
   ablution, since any time may be your death.  With Paul I shout to you
   with that loud voice, "Behold now is the accepted time; behold Now is
   the day of salvation;" [4046] and that Now does not point to any one
   time, but is every present moment.  And again "Awake, thou that
   sleepest, and Christ shall give thee light," [4047] dispelling the
   darkness of sin.  For as Isaiah says, [4048] In the night hope is evil,
   and it is more profitable to be received in the morning.

   XIV.  Sow in good season, and gather together, and open thy barns when
   it is the time to do so; and plant in season, and let the clusters be
   cut when they are ripe, and launch boldly in spring, and draw thy ship
   on shore again at the beginning of winter, when the sea begins to
   rage.  And let there be to thee also a time for war and a time for
   peace; a time to marry, and a time to abstain from marrying; a time for
   friendship, and a time for discord, if this be needed; and in short a
   time for everything, if you will follow Solomon's advice. [4049]   And
   it is best to do so, for the advice is profitable.  But the work of
   your salvation is one upon which you should be engaged at all times;
   and let every time be to you the definite one for Baptism.  If you are
   always passing over to-day and waiting for to-morrow, by your little
   procrastinations you will be cheated without knowing it by the Evil
   One, as his manner is.  Give to me, he says, the present, and to God
   the future; to me your youth, and to God old age; to me your pleasures,
   and to Him your uselessness.  How great is the danger that surrounds
   you.  How many the unexpected mischances.  War has expended you; or an
   earthquake overwhelmed you; or the sea swallowed you up; or a wild
   beast carried you off; or a sickness killed you; or a crumb going the
   wrong way (a most insignificant thing, but what is easier than for a
   man to die, though you are so proud of the divine image); or a too
   freely indulged drinking bout; [4050] or a wind knocked you down; or a
   horse ran away with you; or a drug maliciously scheming against you, or
   perhaps found to be deleterious when meant to be wholesome; or an
   inhuman judge; or an inexorable executioner; or any of the things which
   make the change swiftest and beyond the power of human aid.

   XV.  But if you would fortify yourself beforehand with the Seal, and
   secure yourself for the future with the best and strongest of all aids,
   being signed both in body and in soul with the unction, as Israel was
   of old with that blood and unction of the firstborn at night that
   guarded him, [4051] what then can happen to you, and what has been
   wrought out for you?  Listen to the Proverbs.  "If thou sittest, he
   says, thou shalt be without fear; and if thou sleepest, thy sleep shall
   be sweet." [4052]   And listen to David giving thee the good news,
   "Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, for mischance or
   noonday demon." [4053]   This, even while you live, will greatly
   contribute to your sense of safety (for a sheep that is sealed is not
   easily snared, but that which is unmarked is an easy prey to thieves),
   and at your death a fortunate shroud, more precious than gold, more
   magnificent than a sepulchre, more reverent than fruitless libations,
   [4054] more seasonable than ripe firstfruits, which the dead bestow on
   the dead, making a law out of custom.  Nay, if all things forsake thee,
   [4055] or be taken violently away from thee; money, possessions,
   thrones, distinctions, and everything that belongs to this early
   turmoil, yet you will be able to lay down your life in safety, having
   suffered no loss of the helps which God gave you unto salvation.

   XVI.  But are you afraid lest you should destroy the Gift, and do you
   therefore put off your cleansing, because you cannot have it a second
   time?  What?  Would you not be afraid of danger in time of persecution,
   and of losing the most precious Thing you have--Christ?  Would you then
   on this account avoid becoming a Christian?  Perish the thought.  Such
   a fear is not for a sane man; such an argument argues insanity.  O
   incautious caution, if I may so.  O trick of the Evil One!  Truly he is
   darkness and pretends to be light; and when he can no longer prevail in
   open war, he lays snares in secret, and gives advice, apparently good,
   really evil, if by some trick at least he may prevail, and we find no
   escape from his plotting.  And this is clearly what he is aiming at in
   this instance.  For, being unable to persuade you to despise Baptism,
   he inflicts loss upon you through a fictitious security; that in
   consequence of your fear you may suffer unconsciously the very thing
   you are afraid of; and because you fear to destroy the Gift, you may
   for this very reason fail of the Gift altogether.  This is his
   character; and he will never cease his duplicity as long as he sees us
   pressing onwards towards heaven from which he has fallen.  Wherefore, O
   man of God, do thou recognize the plots of thine adversary; for the
   battle is against him that hath, and it is concerned with the most
   important interests.  Take not thine enemy to be thy counsellor;
   despise not to be and to be called Faithful.  As long as you are a
   Catechumen you are but in the porch of Religion; you must come inside,
   and cross the court, and observe the Holy Things, and look into the
   Holy of Holies, and be in company with the Trinity.  Great are the
   interests for which you are fighting, great too the stability which you
   need.  Protect yourself with the shield of faith.  He fears you, if you
   fight armed with this weapon, and therefore he would strip you of the
   Gift, that he may the more easily overcome you unarmed and
   defenceless.  He assails every age, and every form of life; he must be
   repelled by all.

   XVII.  Art thou young? stand against thy passions; be numbered with the
   alliance in the army of God: [4056]   do valiantly against Goliath.
   [4057]   Take your thousands or your myriads; [4058] thus enjoy your
   manhood; but do not allow your youth to be withered, being killed by
   the imperfection of your faith.  Are you old and near the predestined
   necessity?  Aid your few remaining days.  Entrust the purification to
   your old age.  Why do you fear youthful passion in deep old age and at
   your last breath?  Or will you wait to be washed till you are dead, and
   not so much the object of pity as of dislike?  Are you regretting the
   dregs of pleasure, being yourself in the dregs of life?  It is a
   shameful thing to be past indeed the flower of your age, but not past
   your wickedness; but either to be involved in it still, or at least to
   seem so by delaying your purification.  Have you an infant child?  Do
   not let sin get any opportunity, but let him be sanctified from his
   childhood; from his very tenderest age let him be consecrated by the
   Spirit.  Fearest thou the Seal on account of the weakness of nature?  O
   what a small-souled mother, and of how little faith!  Why, Anna even
   before Samuel was born [4059] promised him to God, and after his birth
   consecrated him at once, and brought him up in the priestly habit, not
   fearing anything in human nature, but trusting in God.  You have no
   need of amulets or incantations, with which the Devil also comes in,
   stealing worship from God for himself in the minds of vainer men.  Give
   your child the Trinity, that great and noble Guard.

   XVIII.  What more?  Are you living in Virginity?  Be sealed by this
   purification; make this the sharer and companion of your life.  Let
   this direct your life, your words, every member, every movement, every
   sense.  Honour it, that it may honour you; that it may give to your
   head a crown of graces, and with a crown of delights may shield you.
   [4060]   Art thou bound by wedlock?  Be bound also by the Seal; make it
   dwell with you as a guardian of your continence, safer than any number
   of eunuchs or of doorkeepers.  Art thou not yet wedded to flesh?  Fear
   not this consecration; thou art pure even after marriage.  I will take
   the risk of that.  I will join you in wedlock.  I will dress the
   bride.  We do not dishonour marriage because we give a higher honour to
   virginity.  I will imitate Christ, the pure Grooms-man and Bridegroom,
   as He both wrought a miracle at a wedding, and honours wedlock with His
   Presence. [4061]   Only let marriage be pure and unmingled with filthy
   lusts.  This only I ask; receive safety from the Gift, and give to the
   Gift the oblation of chastity in its due season, when the fixed time of
   prayer comes round, and that which is more precious than business.  And
   do this by common consent and approval.  For we do not command, we
   exhort; and we would receive something of you for your own profit, and
   the common security of you both.  And in one word, there is no state of
   life and no occupation to which Baptism is not profitable.  You who are
   a free man, [4062] be curbed by it; you who are in slavery, be made of
   equal rank; you who are in grief, receive comfort; let the gladsome be
   disciplined; the poor receive riches that cannot be taken away; the
   rich be made capable of being good stewards of their possessions.  Do
   not play tricks or lay plots against your own salvation.  For even if
   we can delude others we cannot delude ourselves.  And so to play
   against oneself is very dangerous and foolish.

   XIX.  But you have to live in the midst of public affairs, and are
   stained by them; and it would be a terrible thing to waste this mercy.
   The answer is simple.  Flee, if you can, even from the forum, along
   with the good company, making yourself the wings of an eagle, or, to
   speak more suitably, of a dove...for what have you to do with Cæsar or
   the things of Cæsar?...until you can rest where there is no sin, and no
   blackening, and no biting snake in the way to hinder your godly steps.
   Snatch your soul away from the world; flee from Sodom; flee from the
   burning; travel on without turning back, lest you should be fixed as a
   pillar of salt. [4063]   Escape to the Mountain lest you be destroyed
   with the plain.  But if you are already bound and constrained by the
   chain of necessity, reason thus with yourself; or rather let me reason
   thus with you.  It is better both to attain the good and to keep the
   purification.  But if it be impossible to do both it is surely better
   to be a little stained with your public affairs than to fall altogether
   short of grace; just as I think it better to undergo a slight
   punishment from father or master than to be put out of doors; and to be
   a little beamed upon than to be left in total darkness.  And it is the
   part of wise men to choose, as in good things the greater and more
   perfect, so in evils the lesser and lighter.  Wherefore do not overmuch
   dread the purification.  For our success is always judged by comparison
   with our place in life by our just and merciful Judge; and often one
   who is in public life and has had small success has had a greater
   reward than one who in the enjoyment of liberty has not completely
   succeeded; as I think it more marvellous for a man to advance a little
   in fetters, than for one to run who is not carrying any weight; or to
   be only a little spattered in walking through mud, than to be perfectly
   clean when the road is clean.  To give you a proof of what I have
   said:--Rahab the harlot was justified by one thing alone, her
   hospitality, [4064] though she receives no praise for the rest of her
   conduct; and the Publican was exalted by one thing, his humility,
   [4065] though he received no testimony for anything else; so that you
   may learn not easily to despair concerning yourself.

   XX.  But some will say, What shall I gain, if, when I am preoccupied by
   baptism, and have cut off myself by my haste from the pleasures of
   life, when it was in my power to give the reins to pleasure, and then
   to obtain grace?  For the labourers in the vineyard who had worked the
   longest time gained nothing thereby, for equal wages were given to the
   very last. [4066]   You have delivered me from some trouble, whoever
   you are who say this, because you have at last with much difficulty
   told the secret of your delay; and though I cannot applaud your
   shiftiness, I do applaud your confession.  But come hither and listen
   to the interpretation of the parable, that you may not be injured by
   Scripture for want of information.  First of all, there is no question
   here of baptism, but of those who believe at different times and enter
   the good vineyard of the Church.  For from the day and hour at which
   each believed, from that day and hour he is required to work.  And
   then, although they who entered first contributed more to the measure
   of the labour yet they did not contribute more to the measure of the
   purpose; nay perhaps even more was due to the last in respect of this,
   though the statement may seem paradoxical.  For the cause of their
   later entrance was their later call to the work of the vineyard.  In
   all other respects let us see how different they are.  The first did
   not believe or enter till they had agreed on their hire; but the others
   came forward to do the work without an agreement, which is a proof of
   greater faith.  And the first were found to be of an envious and
   murmuring nature, but no such charge is brought against the others.
   And to the first, that which was given was wages, though they were
   worthless fellows; to the last it was the free gift.  So that the first
   were convicted of folly, and with reason deprived of the greater
   reward.  Let us see what would have happened to them if they had been
   late.  Why, the equal pay, evidently.  How then can they blame the
   employer as unjust because of their equality?  For all these things
   take away the merit of their labour from the first, although they were
   at work first; and therefore it turns out that the distribution of
   equal pay was just, if you measure the good will against the labour.

   XXI.  But supposing that the Parable does sketch the power of the font
   according to your interpretation, what would prevent you, if you
   entered first, and bore the heat, from avoiding envy of the last, that
   by this very lovingkindness you might obtain more, and receive the
   reward, not as of grace but as of debt?  And next, the workmen who
   receive the wages are those who have entered, not those who have
   missed, the vineyard; which last is like to be your case.  So that if
   it were certain that you would obtain the Gift, though you are of such
   a mind, and maliciously keep back some of the labour, you might be
   forgiven for taking refuge in such arguments, and desiring to make
   unlawful gain out of the kindness of the master; though I might assure
   you that the very fact of being able to labour is a greater reward to
   any who is not altogether of a huckstering mind.  But since there is a
   risk of your being altogether shut out of the vineyard through your
   bargaining, and losing the capital through stopping to pick up little
   gains, do let yourselves be persuaded by my words to forsake the false
   interpretations and contradictions, and to come forward without arguing
   to receive the Gift, lest you should be snatched away before you
   realize your hopes, and should find out that it was to your own loss
   that you devised these sophistries.

   XXII.  But then, you say, is not God merciful, and since He knows our
   thoughts and searches out our desires, will He not take the desire of
   Baptism instead of Baptism?  You are speaking in riddles, if what you
   mean is that because of God's mercy the unenlightened is enlightened in
   His sight; and he is within the kingdom of heaven who merely desires to
   attain to it, but refrains from doing that which pertains to the
   kingdom.  I will, however, speak out boldly my opinion on these
   matters; and I think that all other sensible men will range themselves
   on my side.  Of those who have received the gift, some were altogether
   alien from God and from salvation, both addicted to all manner of sin,
   and desirous to be bad; others were semivicious, and in a kind of mean
   state between good and bad; others again, while they did that which was
   evil, yet did not approve their own action, just as men in a fever are
   not pleased with their own sickness.  And others even before they were
   illuminated were worthy of praise; partly by nature, and partly by the
   care with which they prepared themselves for Baptism.  These after
   their initiation became evidently better, and less liable to fall; in
   the one case with a view to procuring good, and in the other in order
   to preserve it.  And amongst these, those who gave in to some evil are
   better than those who were altogether bad; and better still than those
   who yielded a little, are those who were more zealous, and broke up
   their fallow ground before Baptism; they have the advantage over the
   others of having already laboured; for the font does not do away with
   good deeds as it does with sins.  But better even than these are they
   who are also cultivating the Gift, and are polishing themselves to the
   utmost possible beauty.

   XXIII.  And so also in those who fail to receive the Gift, some are
   altogether animal or bestial, according as they are either foolish or
   wicked; and this, I think, has to be added to their other sins, that
   they have no reverence at all for this Gift, but look upon it as a mere
   gift--to be acquiesced in if given them, and if not given them, then to
   be neglected.  Others know and honour the Gift, but put it off; some
   through laziness, some through greediness.  Others are not in a
   position to receive it, perhaps on account of infancy, [4067] or some
   perfectly involuntary circumstance through which they are prevented
   from receiving it, even if they wish.  As then in the former case we
   found much difference, so too in this.  They who altogether despise it
   are worse than they who neglect it through greed or carelessness.
   These are worse than they who have lost the Gift through ignorance or
   tyranny, for tyranny is nothing but an involuntary error. [4068]   And
   I think that the first will have to suffer punishment, as for all their
   sins, so for their contempt of baptism; and that the second will also
   have to suffer, but less, because it was not so much through wickedness
   as through folly that they wrought their failure; and that the third
   will be neither glorified nor punished by the righteous Judge, as
   unsealed and yet not wicked, but persons who have suffered rather than
   done wrong.  For not every one who is not bad enough to be punished is
   good enough to be honoured; just as not every one who is not good
   enough to be honoured is bad enough to be punished.  And I look upon it
   as well from another point of view.  If you judge the murderously
   disposed man by his will alone, apart from the act of murder, then you
   may reckon as baptized him who desired baptism apart from the reception
   of baptism.  But if you cannot do the one how can you do the other?  I
   cannot see it.  Or, if you like, we will put it thus:--If desire in
   your opinion has equal power with actual baptism, then judge in the
   same way in regard to glory, and you may be content with longing for
   it, as if that were itself glory.  And what harm is done you by your
   not attaining the actual glory, as long as you have the desire for it?

   XXIV.  Therefore since you have heard these words, come forward to it,
   and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed [4069] through
   missing the Grace.  Receive then the Enlightenment in due season, that
   darkness pursue you not, and catch you, and sever you from the
   Illumining.  The night cometh when no man can work [4070] after our
   departure hence.  The one is the voice of David, the other of the True
   Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. [4071]   And
   consider how Solomon reproves you who are too idle or lethargic,
   saying, How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard, [4072] and when wilt thou
   arise out of thy sleep?  You rely upon this or that, and "pretend
   pretences in sins;" [4073] am waiting for Epiphany; I prefer Easter; I
   will wait for Pentecost. [4074]   It is better to be baptized with
   Christ, to rise with Christ on the Day of His Resurrection, [4075] to
   honour the Manifestation of the Spirit.  And what then?  The end will
   come suddenly in a day for which thou lookest not, and in an hour that
   thou art not aware of; and then you will have for a companion lack of
   grace; and you will be famished in the midst of all those riches of
   goodness, though you ought to reap the opposite fruit from the opposite
   course, a harvest by diligence, and refreshment from the font, like the
   thirsty hart [4076] that runs in haste to the spring, and quenches the
   labour of his race by water; and not to be in Ishmael's case, dried up
   for want of water, [4077] or as the fable has it, punished by thirst in
   the midst of a spring. [4078]   It is a sad thing to let the market day
   go by and then to seek for work.  It is a sad thing to let the Manna
   pass and then to long for food.  It is a sad thing to take a counsel
   too late, and to become sensible of the loss only when it is impossible
   to repair it; that is, after our departure hence, and the bitter
   closing of the acts of each man's life, and the punishment of sinners,
   and the glory of the purified.  Therefore do not delay in coming to
   grace, but hasten, lest the robber outstrip you, lest the adulterer
   pass you by, lest the insatiate be satisfied before you, lest the
   murderer seize the blessing first, or the publican or the fornicator,
   or any of these violent ones who take the Kingdom of heaven by force.
   [4079]   For it suffers violence willingly, and is tyrannized over
   through goodness.

   XXV.  Take my advice, my friend, and be slow to do evil, but swift to
   your salvation; for readiness to evil and tardiness to good are equally
   bad.  If you are invited to a revel, be not swift to go; if to
   apostasy, leap away; if a company of evildoers say to you, "Come with
   us, share our bloodguiltiness, let us hide in the earth a righteous man
   unjustly," [4080] do not lend them even your ears.  Thus you will make
   two very great gains; you will make known to the other his sin, and you
   will deliver yourself from evil company.  But if David the Great say
   unto you, Come and let us rejoice in the Lord; [4081] or another
   Prophet, Come and let us ascend into the Mountain of the Lord; [4082]
   or our Saviour Himself, Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy
   laden, and I will give you rest; [4083] or, Arise, let us go hence,
   shining brightly, glittering above snow, whiter than milk, [4084]
   shining above the sapphire stone; let us not resist or delay.  Let us
   be like Peter and John, and let us hasten; [4085] as they did to the
   Sepulchre and the Resurrection, so we to the Font; running together,
   racing against each other, striving to be first to obtain this
   Blessing.  And say not, "Go away, and come again, and tomorrow I will
   be baptized," [4086] when you may have the blessing today.  "I will
   have with me father, mother, brothers, wife, children, friends, and all
   whom I value, and then I will be saved; but it is not yet the fitting
   time for me to be made bright;" for if you say so, there is reason to
   fear lest you should have as sharers of your sorrow those whom you
   hoped to have as sharers of your joy.  If they will be with you,
   well;--but do not wait for them.  For it is base to say, "But where is
   my offering for my baptism, and where is my baptismal robe, in which I
   shall be made bright, and where is what is wanted for the entertainment
   of my baptizers, that in these too I may become worthy of notice?  For,
   as you see, all these things are necessary, and on account of this the
   Grace will be lessened."  Do not thus trifle with great things, or
   allow yourself to think so basely.  The Sacrament is greater than the
   visible environment.  Offer yourself; clothe yourself with Christ,
   feast me with your conduct; I rejoice to be thus affectionately
   treated, and God Who gives these great gifts rejoices thus.  Nothing is
   great in the sight of God, but what the poor may give, so that the poor
   may not here also be outrun, for they cannot contend with the rich.  In
   other matters there is a distinction between poor and rich, but here
   the more willing is the richer.

   XXVI.  Let nothing hinder you from going on, nor draw you away from
   your readiness.  While your desire is still vehement, seize upon that
   which you desire.  While the iron is hot, let it be tempered by the
   cold water, lest anything should happen in the interval, and put an end
   to your desire.  I am Philip; do you be Candace's Eunuch. [4087]   Do
   you also say, "See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be
   baptized?"  Seize the opportunity; rejoice greatly in the blessing; and
   having spoken be baptized; and having been baptized be saved; and
   though you be an Ethiopian body, be made white in soul.  Do not say, "A
   Bishop shall baptize me,--and he a Metropolitan,--and he of Jerusalem
   (for the Grace does not come of a place, but of the Spirit),--and he of
   noble birth, for it would be a sad thing for my nobility to be insulted
   by being baptized by a man of no family."  Do not say, "I do not mind a
   mere Priest, if he is a celibate, and a religious, and of angelic life;
   for it would be a sad thing for me to be defiled even in the moment of
   my cleansing."  Do not ask for credentials of the preacher or the
   baptizer.  For another is his judge, [4088] and the examiner of what
   thou canst not see.  For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the
   Lord looketh on the heart.  But to thee let every one be trustworthy
   for purification, so only he is one of those who have been approved,
   not of those who are openly condemned, and not a stranger to the
   Church.  Do not judge your judges, you who need healing; and do not
   make nice distinctions about the rank of those who shall cleanse you,
   or be critical about your spiritual fathers.  One may be higher or
   lower than another, but all are higher than you.  Look at it this way.
   One may be golden, another iron, but both are rings and have engraved
   on them the same royal image; and thus when they impress the wax, what
   difference is there between the seal of the one and that of the other?
   None.  Detect the material in the wax, if you are so very clever.  Tell
   me which is the impression of the iron ring, and which of the golden.
   And how do they come to be one?  The difference is in the material and
   not in the seal.  And so anyone can be your baptizer; for though one
   may excel another in his life, yet the grace of baptism is the same,
   and any one may be your consecrator who is formed in the same faith.

   XXVII.  Do not disdain to be baptized with a poor man, if you are rich;
   or if you are noble, with one who is lowborn; or if you are a master,
   with one who is up to the present time your slave.  Not even so will
   you be humbling yourself as Christ, unto Whom you are baptized today,
   Who for your sake took upon Himself even the form of a slave.  From the
   day of your new birth all the old marks were effaced, and Christ was
   put upon all in one form.  Do not disdain to confess your sins, knowing
   how John baptized, that by present shame you may escape from future
   shame (for this too is a part of the future punishment); and prove that
   you really hate sin by making a shew of it openly, and triumphing over
   it as worthy of contempt.  Do not reject the medicine of exorcism, nor
   refuse it because of its length.  This too is a touchstone of your
   right disposition for grace.  What labour have you to do compared with
   that of the Queen of Ethiopia, [4089] who arose and came from the
   utmost part of the earth to see the wisdom of Solomon?  And behold a
   Greater than Solomon is here [4090] in the judgment of those who reason
   maturely.  Do not hesitate either at length of journey, or distance by
   sea; or fire, if this too lies before you; or of any other, small or
   great, of the hindrances that you may attain to the gift.  But if
   without any labour and trouble at all you may obtain that which you
   desire, what folly it is to put off the gift:  "Ho, every one that
   thirsteth, come ye to the waters," [4091] Esaias invites you, "and he
   that hath no money, come buy wine and milk, without money and without
   price."  O swiftness of His mercy:  O easiness of the Covenant:  This
   blessing may be bought by you merely for willing it; He accepts the
   very desire as a great price; He thirsts to be thirsted for; He gives
   to drink to all who desire to drink; He takes it as a kindness to be
   asked for the kindness; He is ready and liberal; He gives with more
   pleasure than others receive. [4092]   Only let us not be condemned for
   frivolity by asking for little, and for what is unworthy of the Giver.
   Blessed is he from whom Jesus asks drink, as He did from that Samaritan
   woman, and gives a well of water springing up unto eternal life. [4093]
     Blessed is he that soweth beside all waters, and upon every soul,
   tomorrow to be ploughed and watered, which today the ox and the ass
   tread, while it is dry and without water, [4094] and oppressed with
   unreason.  And blessed is he who, though he be a "valley of rushes,"
   [4095] is watered out of the House of the Lord; for he is made
   fruitbearing instead of rushbearing, and produces that which is for the
   food of man, not that which is rough and unprofitable.  And for the
   sake of this we must be very careful not to miss the Grace.

   XXVIII.  Be it so, some will say, in the case of those who ask for
   Baptism; what have you to say about those who are still children, and
   conscious neither of the loss nor of the grace?  Are we to baptize them
   too?  Certainly, if any danger presses.  For it is better that they
   should be unconsciously sanctified than that they should depart
   unsealed and uninitiated.

   A proof of this is found in the Circumcision on the eighth day, which
   was a sort of typical seal, and was conferred on children before they
   had the use of reason.  And so is the anointing of the doorposts,
   [4096] which preserved the firstborn, though applied to things which
   had no consciousness.  But in respect of others [4097] I give my advice
   to wait till the end of the third year, or a little more or less, when
   they may be able to listen and to answer something about the Sacrament;
   that, even though they do not perfectly understand it, yet at any rate
   they may know the outlines; and then to sanctify them in soul and body
   with the great sacrament of our consecration.  For this is how the
   matter stands; at that time they begin to be responsible for their
   lives, when reason is matured, and they learn the mystery of life (for
   of sins of ignorance owing to their tender years they have no account
   to give), and it is far more profitable on all accounts to be fortified
   by the Font, because of the sudden assaults of danger that befall us,
   stronger than our helpers.

   XXIX.  But, one says, Christ was thirty years old when He was baptized,
   [4098] and that although He was God; and do you bid us hurry our
   Baptism?--You have solved the difficulty when you say He was God.  For
   He was absolute cleansing; He had no need of cleansing; but it was for
   you that He was purified, just as it was for you that, though He had
   not flesh, yet He is clothed with flesh.  Nor was there any danger to
   Him from putting off Baptism, for He had the ordering of His own
   Passion as of His own Birth.  But in your case the danger is to no
   small interests, if you were to depart after a birth to corruption
   alone, and without being clothed with incorruption.  And there is this
   further point for me to consider, that that particular time of baptism
   was a necessity for Him, but your case is not the same.  He manifested
   Himself in the thirtieth year after His birth and not before; first, in
   order that He might not appear ostentatious, which is a condition
   belonging to vulgar minds; and next, because that age tests virtue
   thoroughly, and is the right time to teach.  And since it was needful
   for Him to undergo the passion which saves the world, it was needful
   also that all things which belong to the passion should fit into the
   passion; the Manifestation, the Baptism, the Witness from Heaven, the
   Proclamation, the concourse of the multitude, the Miracles; and that
   they should be as it were one body, not torn asunder, nor broken apart
   by intervals.  For out of the Baptism and Proclamation arose that
   earthquake of people coming together, [4099] for so Scripture calls
   that time; [4100] and out of the multitude arose the shewing of the
   signs and the miracles that lead up to the Gospel.  And out of these
   came the jealousy, and from this the hatred, and out of the hatred the
   circumstance of the plot against Him, and the betrayal; and out of
   these the Cross, and the other events by which our Salvation has been
   effected.  Such are the reasons in the case of Christ [4101] so far as
   we can attain to them.  And perhaps another more secret reason might be
   found.

   XXX.  But for you, what necessity is there that by following the
   examples which are far above you, you should do a thing so ill-advised
   for yourself?  For there are many other details of the Gospel History
   which are quite different to what happens nowadays, and the seasons of
   which do not correspond.  For instance Christ fasted a little before
   His temptation, we before Easter.  As far as the fasting days are
   concerned it is the same, [4102] but the difference in the seasons is
   no little one.  He armed Himself with them against temptation; but to
   us this fast is symbolical of dying with Christ, and it is a
   purification in preparation for the festival.  And He fasted absolutely
   for forty days, for He was God; but we measure our fasting by our
   power, even though some are led by zeal to rush beyond their strength.
   Again, He gave the Sacrament of the Passover to His Disciples in an
   upper chamber, and after supper, and one day before He suffered; but we
   celebrate it in Houses of Prayer, and before food, [4103] and after His
   resurrection.  He rose again the third day; our resurrection is not
   till after a long time.  But matters which have to do with Him are
   neither abruptly separated from us, nor yet yoked together with those
   which concern us in point of time; but they were handed down to us just
   so far as to be patterns of what we should do, and then they carefully
   avoided an entire and exact resemblance.

   XXXI.  If then you will listen to me, you will bid a long farewell to
   all such arguments, and you will jump at this Blessing, and begin to
   struggle in a twofold conflict; first, to prepare yourself for baptism
   by purifying yourself; and next, to preserve the baptismal gift; for it
   is a matter of equal difficulty to obtain a blessing which we have not,
   and to keep it when we have gained it.  For often what zeal has
   acquired sloth has destroyed; and what hesitation has lost diligence
   has regained.  A great assistance to the attainment of what you desire
   are vigils, fasts, sleeping on the ground, prayers, tears, pity of and
   almsgiving to those who are in need.  And let these be your
   thanksgiving for what you have received, and at the same time your
   safeguard of them.  You have the benefit to remind you of many
   commandments; so do not transgress them.  Does a poor man approach
   you?  Remember how poor you once were, and how rich you were made.  One
   in want of bread or of drink, perhaps another Lazarus, [4104] is cast
   at your gate; respect the Sacramental Table to which you have
   approached, the Bread of Which you have partaken, the Cup in Which you
   have communicated, [4105] being consecrated by the Sufferings of
   Christ.  If a stranger fall at your feet, homeless and a foreigner,
   welcome in him Him who for your sake was a stranger, and that among His
   own, [4106] and who came to dwell in you by His grace, and who drew you
   towards the heavenly dwelling place.  Be a Zaccheus, [4107] who
   yesterday was a Publican, and is to-day of liberal soul; offer all to
   the coming in of Christ, that though small in bodily stature you may
   show yourself great, nobly contemplating Christ.  A sick or a wounded
   man lies before you; respect your own health, and the wounds from which
   Christ delivered you.  If you see one naked clothe him, in honour of
   your own garment of incorruption, which is Christ, for as many as were
   baptized into Christ have put on Christ. [4108]   If you find a debtor
   falling at your feet, [4109] tear up every document, whether just or
   unjust.  Remember the ten thousand talents which Christ forgave you,
   and be not a harsh exactor of a smaller debt--and that from whom?  From
   your fellow servant, you who were forgiven so much more by the Master.
   Otherwise you will have to give satisfaction to His mercy, which you
   would not imitate and take as your copy.

   XXXII.  Let the laver be not for your body only, but also for the image
   of God in you; not merely a washing away of sins in you, but also a
   correction of your temper; let it not only wash away the old filth, but
   let it purify the fountainhead.  Let it not only move you to honourable
   acquisition, but let it teach you also honourably to lose possession;
   or, which is more easy, to make restitution of what you have wrongfully
   acquired.  For what profit is it that your sin should have been
   forgiven you, but the loss which you have inflicted should not be
   repaired to him whom you have injured?  Two sins are on your
   conscience, the one that you made a dishonest gain, the other that you
   retained the gains; you received forgiveness for the one, but in
   respect of the other you are still in sin, for you have still
   possession of what belongs to another; and your sin has not been put to
   an end, but only divided by the time which has elapsed.  Part of it was
   perpetrated before your Baptism, but part remains after your Baptism;
   for Baptism carries forgiveness of Past, not of Present sins; and its
   purification must not be played with, but be genuinely impressed upon
   you; you must be made perfectly bright, and not be merely coloured; you
   must receive the gift, not of a mere covering of your sins, but of a
   taking them clean away.  Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven
   [4110] ...this is done by the complete cleansing...and whose sins are
   hidden...this belongs to those who are not yet healed in their deepest
   soul.  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin....This
   is a third class of sinners, whose actions are not praiseworthy, but
   who are innocent of intention.

   XXXIII.  What say I then, and what is my argument?  Yesterday you were
   a Canaanite soul bent together [4111] by sin; today you have been made
   straight by the Word.  Do not be bent gain, and condemned to the earth,
   as if weighed down by the Devil with a wooden collar, nor get an
   incurable curvature.  Yesterday you were being dried up [4112] by an
   abundant hæmorrhage, for you were pouring out crimson sin; today
   stanched and flourishing again, for you have touched the hem of Christ
   and your issue has been stayed.  Guard, I pray you, the cleansing lest
   you should again have a hæmorrhage, and not be able to lay hold of
   Christ to steal salvation; for Christ does not like to be stolen from
   often, though He is very merciful.  Yesterday you were flung upon a
   bed, exhausted and paralyzed, and you had no one when the water should
   be troubled to put you into the pool. [4113]   Today you have Him Who
   is in one Person Man and God, or rather God and Man.  You were raised
   up from your bed, or rather you took up your bed, and publicly
   acknowledged the benefit.  Do not again be thrown upon your bed by
   sinning, in the evil rest of a body paralyzed by its pleasures.  But as
   you now are, so walk, mindful of the command, [4114] Behold thou art
   made whole; sin no more lest a worse thing happen unto thee if thou
   prove thyself bad after the blessing thou hast received.  You have
   heard the loud voice, Lazarus, come forth, [4115] as you lay in the
   tomb; not, however, after four days, but after many days; and you were
   loosed from the bonds of your graveclothes.  Do not again become dead,
   nor live with those who dwell in the tombs; [4116] nor bind yourself
   with the bonds of your own sins; [4117] for it is uncertain whether you
   will rise again from the tomb till the last and universal resurrection,
   which will bring every work into judgment, [4118] not to be healed, but
   to be judged, and to give account of all which for good or evil it has
   treasured up.

   XXXIV.  If you were full of leprosy, that shapeless evil, yet you
   scraped off the evil matter, and received again the Image whole.  Shew
   your cleansing to me your Priest, that I may recognize how much more
   precious it is than the legal one.  Do not range yourself with the nine
   unthankful men, but imitate the tenth. [4119]   For although he was a
   Samaritan, yet he was of better mind than the others.  Make certain
   that you will not break out again with evil ulcers, and find the
   indisposition of your body hard to heal.  Yesterday meanness and
   avarice were withering your hand; to-day let liberality and kindness
   stretch it out. [4120]   It is a noble cure for a weak hand to disperse
   abroad, to give to the poor, [4121] to pour out the things which we
   possess abundantly, till we reach the very bottom; and perhaps this
   will gush forth food for you, as for the woman of Sarepta, [4122] and
   especially if you happen to be feeding an Elias, to recognize that it
   is a good abundance to be needy for the sake of Christ, Who for our
   sakes became poor.  If you were deaf and dumb, let the Word sound
   [4123] in your ears, or rather keep there Him Who hath sounded.  Do not
   shut your ears to the Instruction of the Lord, and to His Counsel, like
   the adder to charms. [4124]   If you are blind and unenlightened,
   lighten your eyes that you sleep not in death. [4125]   In God's Light
   see light, [4126] and in the Spirit of God be enlightened by the Son,
   That Threefold and Undivided Light.  If you receive all the Word, you
   will bring therewith upon your own soul all the healing powers of
   Christ, with which separately these individuals were healed.  Only be
   not ignorant of the measure of grace; only let not the enemy, while you
   sleep, maliciously sow tares. [4127]   Only take care that as by your
   cleansing you have become an object of enmity to the Evil One, you do
   not again make yourself an object of pity by sin.  Only be careful
   lest, while rejoicing and lifted up above measure by the blessing, you
   fall again through pride.  Only be diligent as to your cleansing,
   "setting ascensions in your heart," [4128] and keep with all diligence
   the remission which you have received as a gift, in order that, while
   the remission comes from God, the preservation of it may come from
   yourself also.

   XXXV.  How shall this be?  Remember always the parable, [4129] and so
   will you best and most perfectly help yourself.  The unclean and
   malignant spirit is gone out of you, being chased by baptism.  He will
   not submit to the expulsion, he will not resign himself to be houseless
   and homeless:  He goes through waterless places, dry of the Divine
   Stream, and there he desires to abide.  He wanders, seeking rest; he
   finds none.  He lights on baptized souls, whose sins the font has
   washed away.  He fears the water; he is choked with the cleansing, as
   the Legion were in the sea. [4130]   Again he returns to the house
   whence he came out.  He is shameless, he is contentious, he makes a
   fresh assault upon it, he makes a new attempt.  If he finds that Christ
   has taken up His abode there, and has filled the place which he had
   vacated, he is driven back again, and goes off without success and is
   become an object of pity in his wandering state.  But if he finds in
   you a place, swept and garnished indeed, but empty and idle, equally
   ready to take in this or that which shall first occupy it, he makes a
   leap into it, he takes up his abode there with a larger train; and the
   last state is worse than the first, inasmuch as then there was a hope
   of amendment and safety, but now the evil is rampant, and drags in sin
   by its flight from good, and therefore the possession is more secure to
   him who dwells there.

   XXXVI.  I will remind you again about Illuminations, and that often,
   and will reckon them up from Holy Scripture.  For I myself shall be
   happier for remembering them (for what is sweeter than light to those
   who have tasted light?) and I will dazzle you with my words.  There is
   sprung up a light for the righteous, and its partner joyful gladness.
   [4131]   And, The light of the righteous is everlasting; [4132] and
   Thou art shining wondrously from the everlasting mountains, is said to
   God, I think of the Angelic powers which aid our efforts after good.
   And you have heard David's words; The Lord is my Light and my
   Salvation, whom then shall I fear? [4133]   And now he asks that the
   Light and the Truth may be sent forth for him, [4134] now giving thanks
   that he has a share in it, in that the Light of God is marked upon him;
   [4135] that is, that the signs of the illumination given are impressed
   upon him and recognized.  One light alone let us shun--that which is
   the offspring of the baleful fire; let us not walk in the light of our
   fire, [4136] and in the flame which we have kindled.  For I know a
   cleansing fire which Christ came to send upon the earth, [4137] and He
   Himself is anagogically [4138] called a Fire.  This Fire takes away
   whatsoever is material and of evil habit; and this He desires to kindle
   with all speed, for He longs for speed in doing us good, since He gives
   us even coals of fire to help us. [4139]   I know also a fire which is
   not cleansing, but avenging; either that fire of Sodom [4140] which He
   pours down on all sinners, [4141] mingled with brimstone and storms, or
   that which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels [4142] or that
   which proceeds from the face of the Lord, and shall burn up his enemies
   round about; [4143] and one even more fearful still than these, the
   unquenchable fire [4144] which is ranged with the worm that dieth not
   but is eternal for the wicked.  For all these belong to the destroying
   power; though some may prefer even in this place to take a more
   merciful view [4145] of this fire, worthily of Him That chastises.

   XXXVII.  And as I know of two kinds of fire, so also do I of light.
   The one is the light of our ruling power directing our steps according
   to the will of God; the other is a deceitful and meddling one, quite
   contrary to the true light, though pretending to be that light, that it
   may cheat us by its appearance.  This really is darkness, yet has the
   appearance of noonday, the high perfection of light.  And so I read
   that passage of those who continually flee in darkness at noonday;
   [4146] for this is really night, and yet is thought to be bright light
   by those who have been ruined by luxury.  For what saith David?  "Night
   was around me and I knew it not, for I thought that my luxury was
   enlightenment." [4147]   But such are they, and in this condition; but
   let us kindle for ourselves the light of knowledge. [4148]   This will
   be done by sowing unto righteousness, and reaping the fruit of life,
   for action is the patron of contemplation, that amongst other things we
   may learn also what is the true light, and what the false, and be saved
   from falling unawares into evil wearing the guise of good.  Let us be
   made light, as it was said to the disciples by the Great Light, ye are
   the light of the world. [4149]   Let us be made lights in the world,
   holding forth the Word of Life; [4150] that is, let us be made a
   quickening power to others.  Let us lay hold of the Godhead; let us lay
   hold of the First and Brightest Light.  Let us walk towards Him
   shining, before our feet stumble upon dark and hostile mountains.
   [4151]   While it is day let us walk honestly as in the day, not in
   rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, [4152] which
   are the dishonesties of the night.

   XXXVIII.  Let us cleanse every member, Brethren, let us purify every
   sense; let nothing in us be imperfect or of our first birth; let us
   leave nothing unilluminated.  Let us enlighten our eyes, [4153] that we
   may look straight on, and not bear in ourselves any harlot idol through
   curious and busy sight; for even though we might not worship lust, yet
   our soul would be defiled.  If there be beam or mote, [4154] let us
   purge it away, that we may be able to see those of others also.  Let us
   be enlightened in our ears; let us be enlightened in our tongue, that
   we may hearken what the Lord God will speak, [4155] and that He may
   cause [4156] us to hear His lovingkindness in the morning, and that we
   may be made to hear of joy and gladness, [4157] spoken into godly ears,
   that we may not be a sharp sword, nor a whetted razor, [4158] nor turn
   under our tongue labour and toil, [4159] but that we may speak the
   Wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden Wisdom, [4160] reverencing
   the fiery tongues. [4161]   Let us be healed also in the smell, that we
   be not effeminate; and be sprinkled with dust instead of sweet
   perfumes, [4162] but may smell the Ointment that was poured out for us,
   [4163] spiritually receiving it; and so formed and transformed by it,
   that from us too a sweet odour may be smelled.  Let us cleanse our
   touch, our taste, our throat, not touching them over gently, nor
   delighting in smooth things, but handling them as is worthy of Him, the
   Word That was made flesh for us; and so far following the example of
   Thomas, [4164] not pampering them with dainties and sauces, those
   brethren of a more baleful pampering, [4165] but tasting and learning
   that the Lord is good, [4166] with the better and abiding taste; and
   not for a short while refreshing that baneful and thankless dust, which
   lets pass and does not hold that which is given to it; but delighting
   it with the words which are sweeter than honey. [4167]

   XXXIX.  And in addition to what has been said, it is good with our head
   cleansed, as the head which is the workshop of the senses is cleansed,
   to hold fast the Head of Christ, [4168] from which the whole body is
   fitly joined together and compacted; and to cast down our sin that
   exalted itself, when it would exalt us above our better part.  It is
   good also for the shoulder to be sanctified and purified that it may be
   able to take up the Cross of Christ, which not everyone can easily do.
   It is good for the hands to be consecrated, and the feet; the one that
   they may in every place be lifted up holy; [4169] and that they may lay
   hold of the discipline [4170] of Christ, lest the Lord at any time be
   angered; and that the Word may gain credence by action, as was the case
   with that which was given in the hand of a prophet; [4171] the other,
   that they be not swift to shed blood, nor to run to evil, [4172] but
   that they be prompt to run to the Gospel and the Prize [4173] of the
   high Calling, and to receive Christ Who washes and cleanses them.  And
   if there be also a cleansing of that belly which receiveth and
   digesteth the food of the Word, it were good also; not to make it a god
   by luxury and the meat that perisheth, [4174] but rather to give it all
   possible cleansing, and to make it more spare, that it may receive the
   Word of God at the very heart, and grieve honourably over the sins of
   Israel. [4175]   I find also the heart and inward parts deemed worthy
   of honour.  David convinces me of this, when he prays that a clean
   heart may be created in him, and a right spirit renewed in his inward
   parts; [4176] meaning, I think, the mind and its movements or thoughts.

   XL.  And what of the loins, or reins, for we must not pass these over?
   Let the purification take hold of these also.  Let our loins be girded
   about and kept in check by continence, as the Law bade Israel of old
   when partaking of the Passover. [4177]   For none comes out of Egypt
   purely, or escapes the Destroyer, except he who has disciplined these.
   And let the reins be changed by that good conversion by which they
   transfer all the affections to God, so that they can say, Lord, all my
   desire is before Thee, [4178] and the day of man have I not desired;
   [4179] for you must be a man of desires, [4180] but they must be those
   of the spirit.  For thus you would destroy the dragon that carries the
   greater part of his strength upon his navel and his loins, [4181] by
   slaying the power that comes to him from these.  Do not be surprised at
   my giving a more abundant honour to our uncomely parts, [4182]
   mortifying them and making them chaste by my speech, and standing up
   against the flesh.  Let us give to God all our members which are upon
   the earth; [4183] let us consecrate them all; not the lobe of the liver
   [4184] or the kidneys with the fat, nor some part of our bodies now
   this now that (why should we despise the rest?); but let us bring
   ourselves entire, let us be reasonable holocausts, [4185] perfect
   sacrifices; and let us not make only the shoulder or the breast a
   portion for the Priest to take away, [4186] for that would be a small
   thing, but let us give ourselves entire, that we may receive back
   ourselves entire; for this is to receive entirely, when we give
   ourselves to God and offer as a sacrifice our own salvation.

   XLI.  Besides all this and before all, keep I pray you the good
   deposit, by which I live and work, and which I desire to have as the
   companion of my departure; with which I endure all that is so
   distressful, and despise all delights; the confession of the Father and
   the Son and the Holy Ghost.  This I commit unto you to-day; with this I
   will baptize you and make you grow.  This I give you to share, and to
   defend all your life, the One Godhead and Power, found in the Three in
   Unity, and comprising the Three separately, not unequal, in substances
   or natures, neither increased nor diminished by superiorities or
   inferiorities; in every respect equal, in every respect the same; just
   as the beauty and the greatness of the heavens is one; the infinite
   conjunction of Three Infinite Ones, Each God when considered in
   Himself; as the Father so the Son, as the Son so the Holy Ghost; the
   Three One God when contemplated together; Each God because
   Consubstantial; One God because of the Monarchia.  No sooner do I
   conceive of the One than I am illumined by the Splendour of the Three;
   no sooner do I distinguish Them than I am carried back to the One.
   When I think of any One of the Three I think of Him as the Whole, and
   my eyes are filled, and the greater part of what I am thinking of
   escapes me. [4187]   I cannot grasp the greatness of That One so as to
   attribute a greater greatness to the Rest.  When I contemplate the
   Three together, I see but one torch, and cannot divide or measure out
   the Undivided Light.

   XLII.  Do you fear to speak of Generation lest you should attribute
   aught of passion to the impassible God?  I on the other hand fear to
   speak of Creation, lest I should destroy God by the insult and the
   untrue division, either cutting the Son away from the Father, or from
   the Son the Substance of the Spirit.  For this paradox is involved,
   that not only is a created Life foisted into the Godhead by those who
   measure Godhead badly; but even this created life is divided against
   itself.  For as these low earthly minds make the Son subject to the
   Father, so again is the rank of the Spirit made inferior to that of the
   Son, until both God and created life are insulted by the new Theology.
   No, my friends, there is nothing servile in the Trinity, nothing
   created, nothing accidental, as I have heard one of the wise [4188]
   say.  If I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ, says
   the Apostle; [4189] and if I yet worshipped a creature, or were
   baptized into a creature, I should not be made divine, nor have changed
   my first birth.  What shall I say to those who worship Astarte or
   Chemosh, the abomination of the Sidonians, or the likeness of a star,
   [4190] a god a little above them to these idolaters, but yet a creature
   and a piece of workmanship, when I myself either do not worship Two of
   Those into Whose united Name I am baptized, or else worship my
   fellow-servants, for they are fellow-servants, even if a little higher
   in the scale; for differences must exist among fellow-servants.

   XLIII.  I should like to call the Father the greater, because from him
   flows both the Equality and the Being of the Equals (this will be
   granted on all hands), but I am afraid to use the word Origin, lest I
   should make Him the Origin of Inferiors, and thus insult Him by
   precedencies of honour.  For the lowering of those Who are from Him is
   no glory to the Source.  Moreover, I look with suspicion at your
   insatiate desire, for fear you should take hold of this word Greater,
   and divide the Nature, using the word Greater in all senses, whereas it
   does not apply to the Nature, but only to Origination.  For in the
   Consubstantial Persons there is nothing greater or less in point of
   Substance.  I would honour the Son as Son before the Spirit, but
   Baptism consecrating me through the Spirit does not allow of this.  But
   are you afraid of being reproached with Tritheism?  Do you take
   possession of this good thing, the Unity in the Three, and leave me to
   fight the battle.  Let me be the shipbuilder, and do you use the ship;
   or if another is the builder of the ship, take me for the architect of
   the house, and do you live in it with safety, though you spent no
   labour upon it.  You shall not have a less prosperous voyage, or a less
   safe habitation than I who built them, because you have not laboured
   upon them.  See how great is my indulgence; see the goodness of the
   Spirit; the war shall be mine, yours the achievement; I will be under
   fire, and you shall live in peace; but join with your defender in
   prayer, and give me your hand by the Faith.  I have three stones which
   I will sling at the Philistine; [4191] I have three inspirations
   against the son of the Sareptan, [4192] with which I will quicken the
   slain; I have three floods against the faggots with which I will
   consecrate the Sacrifice with water, raising the most unexpected fire;
   [4193] and I will throw down the prophets of shame by the power of the
   Sacrament.

   XLIV.  What need have I any more of speech?  It is the time for
   teaching, not for controversy.  I protest before God and the elect
   Angels, [4194] be thou baptized in this faith.  If thy heart is written
   upon in some other way than as my teaching demands, come and have the
   writing changed; I am no unskilled caligrapher of these truths.  I
   write that which is written upon my own heart; and I teach that which I
   have been taught, and have kept from the beginning up to these hoar
   hairs. [4195]   Mine is the risk; be mine also the reward of being the
   Director of your soul, and consecrating you by Baptism.  But if you are
   already rightly disposed, and marked with the good inscription, see
   that you keep what is written, and remain unchanged in a changing time
   concerning an unchanging Thing.  Follow Pilate's example in the better
   sense; you who are rightly written on, imitate him who wrote
   wrongfully.  Say to those who would persuade you differently, what I
   have written, I have written. [4196]   For indeed I should be ashamed
   if, while that which was wrong remained inflexible, that which is right
   should be so easily bent aside; whereas we ought to be easily bent to
   that which is better from that which is worse, but immovable from the
   better to the worse.  If it be thus, and according to this teaching
   that you come to Baptism, lo I will not refrain my lips, [4197] lo I
   lend my hands to the Spirit; let us hasten your salvation.  The Spirit
   is eager, the Consecrator is ready, the Gift is prepared.  But if you
   still halt and will not receive the perfectness of the Godhead, go and
   look for someone else to baptize--or rather to drown you:  I have no
   time to cut the Godhead, and to make you dead in the moment of your
   regeneration, that you should have neither the Gift nor the Hope of
   Grace, but should in so short a time make shipwreck of your salvation.
   For whatever you may subtract from the Deity of the Three, you will
   have overthrown the whole, and destroyed your own being made perfect.

   XLV.  But not yet perhaps is there formed upon your soul any writing
   good or bad; and you want to be written upon today, and formed by us
   unto perfection.  Let us go within the cloud.  Give me the tables of
   your heart; I will be your Moses, though this be a bold thing to say; I
   will write on them with the finger of God a new Decalogue. [4198]   I
   will write on them a shorter method of salvation.  And if there be any
   heretical or unreasoning beast, let him remain below, or he will run
   the risk of being stoned by the Word of truth.  I will baptize you and
   make you a disciple in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the
   Holy Ghost; [4199] and These Three have One common name, the Godhead.
   And you shall know, both by appearances [4200] and by words that you
   reject all ungodliness, and are united to all the Godhead.  Believe
   that all that is in the world, both all that is seen and all that is
   unseen, was made out of nothing by God, and is governed by the
   Providence of its Creator, and will receive a change to a better
   state.  Believe that evil has no substance or kingdom, either
   unoriginate or self-existent or created by God; but that it is our
   work, and the evil one's, and came upon us through our heedlessness,
   but not from our Creator.  Believe that the Son of God, the Eternal
   Word, Who was begotten of the Father before all time and without body,
   was in these latter days for your sake made also Son of Man, born of
   the Virgin Mary ineffably and stainlessly (for nothing can be stained
   where God is, and by which salvation comes), in His own Person at once
   entire Man and perfect God, for the sake of the entire sufferer, that
   He may bestow salvation on your whole being, having destroyed the whole
   condemnation of your sins:  impassible in His Godhead, passible in that
   which He assumed; as much Man for your sake as you are made God for
   His.  Believe that for us sinners He was led to death; was crucified
   and buried, so far as to taste of death; and that He rose again the
   third day, and ascended into heaven, that He might take you with Him
   who were lying low; and that He will come again with His glorious
   Presence to judge the quick and the dead; no longer flesh, nor yet
   without a body, according to the laws which He alone knows of a more
   godlike body, that He may be seen by those who pierced Him, [4201] and
   on the other hand may remain as God without carnality.  Receive besides
   this the Resurrection, the Judgment and the Reward according to the
   righteous scales of God; and believe that this will be Light to those
   whose mind is purified (that is, God--seen and known) proportionate to
   their degree of purity, which we call the Kingdom of heaven; but to
   those who suffer from blindness of their ruling faculty, darkness, that
   is estrangement from God, proportionate to their blindness here.  Then,
   in the tenth place, work that which is good upon this foundation of
   dogma; for faith without works is dead, [4202] even as are works apart
   from faith.  This is all that may be divulged of the Sacrament, and
   that is not forbidden to the ear of the many.  The rest you shall learn
   within the Church by the grace of the Holy Trinity; and those matters
   you shall conceal within yourself, sealed and secure.

   XLVI.  But one thing more I preach unto you.  The Station in which you
   shall presently stand after your Baptism before the Great Sanctuary
   [4203] is a foretype of the future glory.  The Psalmody with which you
   will be received is a prelude to the Psalmody of Heaven; the lamps
   which you will kindle are a Sacrament of the illumination there with
   which we shall meet the Bridegroom, shining and virgin souls, with the
   lamps of our faith shining, not sleeping through our carelessness, that
   we may not miss Him that we look for if He come unexpectedly; nor yet
   unfed, and without oil, and destitute of good works, that we be not
   cast out of the Bridechamber.  For I see how pitiable is such a case.
   He will come when the cry demands the meeting, and they who are prudent
   shall meet Him, with their light shining and its food abundant, but the
   others seeking for oil too late from those who possess it.  And He will
   come with speed, and the former shall go in with Him, but the latter
   shall be shut out, having wasted in preparations the time of entrance;
   and they shall weep sore when all too late they learn the penalty of
   their slothfulness, when the Bride-chamber can no longer be entered by
   them for all their entreaties, for they have shut it against themselves
   by their sin, following in another fashion the example of those who
   missed the Wedding feast [4204] with which the good Father feasts the
   good Bridegroom; one on account of a newly wedded wife; another of a
   newly purchased field; another of a yoke of oxen; which he and they
   acquired to their misfortune, since for the sake of the little they
   lose the great.  For none are there of the disdainful, nor of the
   slothful, nor of those who are clothed in filthy rags and not in the
   Wedding garment even though here they may have thought themselves
   worthy of wearing the bright robe there, and secretly intruded
   themselves, deceiving themselves with vain hopes.  And then, What?
   When we have entered, then the Bridegroom knows what He will teach us,
   and how He will converse with the souls that have come in with Him.  He
   will converse with them, I think in teaching things more perfect and
   more pure.  Of which may we all, both Teachers and Taught, have share,
   in the Same Christ our Lord, to Whom be the Glory and the Empire, for
   ever and ever.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4009] Enlightenment (photismos) is one of the most ancient names for
   Holy Baptism; the name, in fact, which S. Gregory uses throughout this
   Oration, and which his Latin translator almost invariably renders by
   Baptismus.

   [4010] This Veil is Original Sin, by which the soul is darkened and as
   it were covered.

   [4011] All Mankind (pan to plasma).  plasma would not be correctly
   rendered by Creation.  It is a word belonging solely to Man, who was
   formed by the Hand of God, and who, alone among creatures, has to give
   an account of his past life to his Creator at the Last Day.  (Edd.

   loosely quoted from 1 S. Peter iii. 21, where the A.V. renders "the
   answer of a good conscience towards God," and the R.V., "The
   interrogation (Marg. inquiry) of a good conscience, etc."  The passage
   is usually explained as referring to the Interrogatories in Holy
   Baptism, answered by the threefold Vow which enlists us "under Christ's
   banner against sin, the world, and the Devil," professes the Faith, and
   promises obedience.

   [4044] There is here an untranslatable play upon words.

   [4045] Again a play upon words.  Baptizesthai is sometimes used in the
   sense of to be drowned.  The word primarily means to Immerse, and this
   of course, when applied to a ship, is to sink her.  The practice of
   immersion in Holy Baptism was undoubtedly universal in the primitive
   ages, except where in cases of necessity persons were baptized in
   sickness, or in prison under sentence of death; and in such cases this
   "Clinic" Baptism, though recognized as valid, and therefore not to be
   repeated, was viewed as irregular, and disqualified its recipient from
   subsequently receiving Holy Orders.  Affusion was gradually allowed,
   probably for climatic reasons, to become the prevailing practice of the
   West, though immersion predominated as late as the Twelfth Century.  It
   is, however, a remarkable fact that the Didache, a Manual of
   instruction which some date within the lifetime of the Apostles, and
   nearly all are agreed in placing not later than the early years of the
   Second Century, expressly permits affusion, without any hint of
   irregularity, or mention of any circumstance of necessity except
   scarcity of water.

   against passions with the assistance (of Baptism), be numbered in the
   army of God." remarking that David fought Goliath without allies,
   leaning on God's assistance; and that S. Gregory here certainly means
   that a Christian who relies on the aid of his Baptism is to stand firm
   in the battle against the Devil.

   [4067] That S. Gregory did not reject infant Baptism is clear, from the
   directions given later on in this Oration (c. xxviii; and cf. c. xvii.
   s. fin.).  He is here referring simply to the inability of infants to
   bring themselves to the font whereby through the mistaken scruples of
   parents many must have died unbaptized.

   [4074] The Festivals of Easter and Pentecost were set apart as early as
   the Second Century for the solemn administration of Holy Baptism; and
   S. Siricius Bishop of Rome about the time of S. Gregory of Nazianzus,
   states that all the Churches agreed in keeping these exclusively.  But
   this is a mistake (though Van Espen says (II., c. i., tit. 2, c. 4)
   that S. Siricius acknowledges the existence of the different custom,
   but condemns it, and gives reference to ad. Himerum Tarraconensem, c.
   2), for there is evidence that in many Churches the Epiphany also was
   thus observed, and in some Christmas also.  But Tertullian (De Bapt.)
   says that no time is unsuitable.  In the Western Church, however, Papal
   decrees, Conciliar Canons, and Imperial Capitularies from the VIth to
   the XIIIth. Centuries abound, limiting the administration, except in
   cases of sickness, to the two seasons of Easter and Pentecost, on the
   Vigils of which it is still provided for in the Missals.  No doubt it
   was felt to be a very useful limitation, when most persons who were
   presented for Baptism were adults, and required preparation.  When this
   ceased to be the case the rule gradually became obsolete, and has long
   ceased to be observed.

   the kidneys and the fat) should especially be sacrificed to God.  Again
   Moses assigned the shoulder and the breast of some sacrifices to the
   Priests, hinting obscurely at this, that we ought to take care to offer
   our hearts to the Priests by confession (for the heart is signified by
   the breast which protects it) and also our actions, which are intended
   by the shoulder, that by the Priest they may be presented to God.  But
   the Apostle bids us mortify all our members which are upon the earth,
   and offer ourselves entire as a sacrifice to God, destroying with the

   which it is covered.  It has three doors, one in the centre, called the
   Royal Gates, leading to the Altar; one on the left hand, leading to the
   Prothesis, or Credence; and one on the right to the Sacristy.  The
   whole raised portion is called the Bema, or sometimes the Altar, the
   Altar proper being known as the Throne.

   Oration XLI.

   On Pentecost.

   It is uncertain to what year the following Oration belongs.  It was,
   however, certainly delivered at Constantinople; the Benedictine Editors
   think in the year 381, in which case the day would be May 16.  An
   indication tending to establish this date is found in c. 14, in the
   expression of apprehension of personal danger to himself for his
   boldness in setting forth the true faith.  In fact, in the earlier part
   of this year, after the Emperor Theodosius had put him in possession of
   the Patriarchal Throne, vacant by the expulsion and deposition of the
   Arian Demophilus, he had narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of
   the Arians.

   The Oration deals again with the subject of the Fifth Theological
   Oration, the question of the Deity of the Holy Ghost, but proceeds to
   establish the point by quite a different set of arguments from those
   adopted in the former discourse, none of whose points are here
   repeated.

   The Preacher begins by commenting on the various ways in which
   Festivals are kept by Jews, by Heathen and by Christians.  Then he
   remarked on the mystical significance of the number Seven, which he
   illustrates by several instances; and next proceeds with his principal
   Subject.

   God the Holy Ghost, he says, completes the work of Christ.  Those who
   regard Him as a Created Being, as did the followers of Macedonius, are
   thereby guilty of blasphemy and impiety.  The true Faith recognizes Him
   as God; and this belief is necessary to salvation; yet some reserve
   must be employed in applying that Name to Him.  We must indeed insist
   on the recognition of His possession of all the attributes of Godhead;
   and we must at any rate bear with those who, like the Orator himself,
   also give Him the Name of God, which he hopes all his hearers will
   receive from the Holy Ghost grace to do.  Then he proceeds to shew from
   Holy Scripture that in fact all the Attributes of Deity do belong to
   the Holy Spirit; and that His distinctive Personal Mark is that He is
   neither Unbegotten like the Father, nor Begotten like the Son.  He does
   not touch on the question of the double Procession.

   It would seem from some expressions in c. 8 that this Discourse was not
   delivered to his usual audience, but to an Assembly of "Religious."

   The Title of the Oration varies in different mss.  Thus some have it
   "Of The Same On Pentecost," to which one adds "And On The Holy Spirit;"
   and another puts it "Of The Same, a Homily on Pentecost."  The printed
   Editions before the Benedictine have "On The Holy Pentecost."

   I.  Let us reason a little about the Festival, that we may keep it
   spiritually.  For different persons have different ways of keeping
   Festival; but to the worshipper of the Word a discourse seems best; and
   of discourses, that which is best adapted to the occasion.  And of all
   beautiful things none gives so much joy to the lover of the beautiful,
   as that the lover of festivals should keep them spiritually.  Let us
   look into the matter thus.  The Jew keeps festival as well as we, but
   only in the letter.  For while following after the bodily Law, he has
   not attained to the spiritual Law.  The Greek too keeps festival, but
   only in the body, and in honour of his own gods and demons, some of
   whom are creators of passion by their own admission, and others were
   honoured out of passion.  Therefore even their manner of keeping
   festival is passionate, as though their very sin were an honour to God,
   in Whom their passion takes refuge as a thing to be proud of. [4205]
   We too keep festival, but we keep it as is pleasing to the Spirit.  And
   it is pleasing to Him that we should keep it by discharging some duty,
   either of action or speech.  This then is our manner of keeping
   festival, to treasure up in our soul some of those things which are
   permanent and will cleave to it, not of those which will forsake us and
   be destroyed, and which only tickle our senses for a little while;
   whereas they are for the most part, in my judgment at least, harmful
   and ruinous.  For sufficient unto the body is the evil thereof.  What
   need has that fire of further fuel, or that beast of more plentiful
   food, to make it more uncontrollable, and too violent for reason?

   II.  Wherefore we must keep the feast spiritually.  And this is the
   beginning of our discourse; for we must speak, even if our speech do
   seem a little too discursive; and we must be diligent for the sake of
   those who love learning, that we may as it were mix up some seasoning
   with our solemn festival.  The children of the Hebrews do honour to the
   number Seven, according to the legislation of Moses (as did the
   Pythagoreans in later days to the number Four, by which indeed they
   were in the habit of swearing [4206] as the Simonians and Marcionites
   [4207] do by the number Eight and the number Thirty, inasmuch as they
   have given names to and reverence a system of Æons of these numbers); I
   cannot say by what rules of analogy, or in consequence of what power of
   this number; anyhow they do honour to it.  One thing indeed is evident,
   that God, having in six days created matter, and given it form, and
   having arranged it in all kinds of shapes and mixtures, and having made
   this present visible world, on the seventh day rested from all His
   works, as is shewn by the very name of the Sabbath, which in Hebrew
   means Rest.  If there be, however, any more lofty reason than this, let
   others discuss it.  But this honour which they pay to it is not
   confined to days alone, but also extends to years.  That belonging to
   days the Sabbath proves, because it is continually observed among them;
   and in accordance with this the removal of leaven is for that number of
   days. [4208]   And that belonging to years is shewn by the seventh
   year, the year of Release; [4209] and it consists not only of
   Hebdomads, but of Hebdomads of Hebdomads, alike in days and years.  The
   Hebdomads of days give birth to Pentecost, a day called holy among
   them; and those of years to what they call the Jubilee, which also has
   a release of land, and a manumission of slaves, and a release of
   possessions bought.  For this nation consecrates to God, not only the
   firstfruits of offspring, or of firstborn, but also those of days and
   years.  Thus the veneration paid to the number Seven gave rise also to
   the veneration of Pentecost.  For seven being multiplied by seven
   generates fifty all but one day, which we borrow from the world to
   come, at once the Eighth and the first, or rather one and
   indestructible.  For the present sabbatism of our souls can find its
   cessation there, that a portion may be given to seven and also to eight
   [4210] (so some of our predecessors have interpreted this passage of
   Solomon).

   III.  As to the honour paid to Seven there are many testimonies, but we
   will be content with a few out of the many.  For instance, seven
   precious spirits are named; for I think Isaiah [4211] loves to call the
   activities of the Spirit spirits; and the Oracles of the Lord are
   purified seven times according to David, [4212] and the just is
   delivered from six troubles and in the seventh is not smitten. [4213]
   But the sinner is pardoned not seven times, but seventy times seven.
   [4214]   And we may see it by the contrary also (for the punishment of
   wickedness is to be praised), Cain being avenged seven times, that is,
   punishment being exacted from him for his fratricide, and Lamech
   seventy times seven, [4215] because he was a murderer after the law and
   the condemnation. [4216]   And wicked neighbours receive sevenfold into
   their bosom; [4217] and the House of Wisdom rests on seven pillars
   [4218] and the Stone of Zerubbabel is adorned with seven eyes; [4219]
   and God is praised seven times a day. [4220]   And again the barren
   beareth seven, [4221] the perfect number, she who is contrasted with
   her who is imperfect in her children. [4222]

   IV.  And if we must also look at ancient history, I perceive that
   Enoch, [4223] the seventh among our ancestors, was honoured by
   translation.  I perceive also that the twenty-first, Abraham, [4224]
   was given the glory of the Patriarchate, by the addition of a greater
   mystery.  For the Hebdomad thrice repeated brings out this number.  And
   one who is very bold might venture even to come to the New Adam, my God
   and Lord Jesus Christ, Who is counted the Seventy-seventh from the old
   Adam who fell under sin, in the backward genealogy according to Luke.
   [4225]   And I think of the seven trumpets of Jesus, the son of Nave,
   and the same number of circuits and days and priests, by which the
   walls of Jericho were shaken down. [4226]   And so too the seven
   compassings of the City; in the same way as there is a mystery in the
   threefold breathings of Elias, the Prophet, by which he breathed life
   into the son of the Sareptan widow, [4227] and the same number of his
   floodings of the wood, [4228] when he consumed the sacrifice with fire
   sent from God, and condemned the prophets of shame who could not do the
   like at his challenge.  And the sevenfold looking for the cloud imposed
   upon the young servant; and Elissæus stretching himself that number of
   times upon the child of the Shunammite, by which stretching the breath
   of life was restored. [4229]   To the same doctrine belongs, I think
   (if I may omit the seven-stemmed and seven-lamped candlestick of the
   Temple [4230] ) that the ceremony of the Priests' consecration lasted
   seven days; [4231] and seven that of the purifying of a leper, [4232]
   and that of the Dedication of the Temple [4233] the same number, and
   that in the seventieth year the people returned from the Captivity;
   [4234] that whatever is in Units may appear also in Decads, and the
   mystery of the Hebdomad be reverenced in a more perfect number.  But
   why do I speak of the distant past?  Jesus Himself who is pure
   perfection, could in the desert and with five loaves feed five
   thousand, and again with seven loaves four thousand.  And the leavings
   after they were satisfied were in the first case twelve baskets full,
   and in the other seven baskets; [4235] neither, I imagine, without a
   reason or unworthy of the Spirit.  And if you read for yourself you may
   take note of many numbers which contain a meaning deeper than appears
   on the surface.  But to come to an instance which is most useful to us
   on the present occasion, not that for these reasons or others very
   similar or yet more divine, the Hebrews honour the Day of Pentecost,
   and we also honour it; just as there are other rites of the Hebrews
   which we observe...they were typically observed by them, and by us they
   are sacramentally reinstated.  And now having said so much by way of
   preface about the Day, let us proceed to what we have to say further.

   V.  We are keeping the feast of Pentecost and of the Coming of the
   Spirit, and the appointed time of the Promise, and the fulfilment of
   our hope.  And how great, how august, is the Mystery.  The
   dispensations of the Body of Christ are ended; or rather, what belongs
   to His Bodily Advent (for I hesitate to say the Dispensation of His
   Body, as long as no discourse persuades me that it is better to have
   put off the body [4236] ), and that of the Spirit is beginning.  And
   what were the things pertaining to the Christ?  The Virgin, the Birth,
   the Manger, the Swaddling, the Angels glorifying Him, the Shepherds
   running to Him, the course of the Star, the Magi worshipping Him and
   bringing Gifts, Herod's murder of the children, the Flight of Jesus
   into Egypt, the Return from Egypt, the Circumcision, the Baptism, the
   Witness from Heaven, the Temptation, the Stoning for our sake (because
   He had to be given as an Example to us of enduring affliction for the
   Word), the Betrayal, the Nailing, the Burial, the Resurrection, the
   Ascension; and of these even now He suffers many dishonours at the
   hands of the enemies of Christ; and He bears them, for He is
   longsuffering.  But from those who love Him He receives all that is
   honourable.  And He defers, as in the former case His wrath, so in ours
   His kindness; in their case perhaps to give them the grace of
   repentance, and in ours to test our love; whether we do not faint in
   our tribulations [4237] and conflicts for the true Religion, as was
   from of old the order of His Divine Economy, and of his unsearchable
   judgments, with which He orders wisely all that concerns us.  Such are
   the mysteries of Christ.  And what follows we shall see to be more
   glorious; and may we too be seen.  As to the things of the Spirit, may
   the Spirit be with me, and grant me speech as much as I desire; or if
   not that, yet as is in due proportion to the season.  Anyhow He will be
   with me as my Lord; not in servile guise, nor awaiting a command, as
   some think. [4238]   For He bloweth where He wills and on whom He
   wills, and to what extent He wills. [4239]   Thus we are inspired both
   to think and to speak of the Spirit.

   VI.  They who reduce the Holy Spirit to the rank of a creature are
   blasphemers and wicked servants, and worst of the wicked.  For it is
   the part of wicked servants to despise Lordship, and to rebel against
   dominion, and to make That which is free their fellow-servant.  But
   they who deem Him God are inspired by God [4240] and are illustrious in
   their mind; and they who go further and call Him so, if to well
   disposed hearers are exalted; if to the low, are not reserved enough,
   for they commit pearls to clay, and the noise of thunder to weak ears,
   and the sun to feeble eyes, and solid food to those who are still using
   milk; [4241] whereas they ought to lead them little by little up to
   what lies beyond them, and to bring them up to the higher truth; adding
   light to light, and supplying truth upon truth.  Therefore we will
   leave the more mature discourse, for which the time has not yet come,
   and will speak with them as follows.

   VII.  If, my friends, you will not acknowledge the Holy Spirit to be
   uncreated, nor yet eternal; clearly such a state of mind is due to the
   contrary spirit--forgive me, if in my zeal I speak somewhat over
   boldly.  If, however, you are sound enough to escape this evident
   impiety, and to place outside of slavery Him Who gives freedom to
   yourselves, then see for yourselves with the help of the Holy Ghost and
   of us what follows.  For I am persuaded that you are to some extent
   partakers of Him, so that I will go into the question with you as
   kindred souls.  Either shew me some mean between lordship and
   servitude, that I may there place the rank of the Spirit; or, if you
   shrink from imputing servitude to Him, there is no doubt of the rank in
   which you must place the object of your search.  But you are
   dissatisfied with the syllables, and you stumble at the word, and it is
   to you a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; [4242] for so is
   Christ to some minds.  It is only human after all.  Let us meet one
   another in a spiritual manner; let us be full rather of brotherly than
   of self love.  Grant us the Power of the Godhead, and we will give up
   to you the use of the Name.  Confess the Nature in other words for
   which you have greater reverence, and we will heal you as infirm
   people, filching from you some matters in which you delight.  For it is
   shameful, yes, shameful and utterly illogical, when you are sound in
   soul, to draw petty distinctions about the sound, and to hide the
   Treasure, as if you envied it to others, or were afraid lest you should
   sanctify your own tongue too.  But it is even more shameful for us to
   be in the state of which we accuse you, and, while condemning your
   petty distinctions of words to make petty distinctions of letters.

   VIII.  Confess, my friends, the Trinity to be of One Godhead; or if you
   will, of One Nature; and we will pray the Spirit to give you this word
   God.  He will give it to you, I well know, inasmuch as He has already
   granted you the first portion and the second; [4243] and especially if
   that about which we are contending is some spiritual cowardice, and not
   the devil's objection.  Yet more clearly and concisely, let me say, do
   not you call us to account for our loftier word (for envy has nothing
   to do with this ascent), and we will not find fault with what you have
   been able to attain, until by another road you are brought up to the
   same resting place.  For we are not seeking victory, but to gain
   brethren, by whose separation from us we are torn.  This we concede to
   you in whom we do find something of vital truth, who are sound as to
   the Son.  We admire your life, but we do not altogether approve your
   doctrine.  Ye who have the things of the Spirit, receive Himself in
   addition, that ye may not only strive, but strive lawfully, [4244]
   which is the condition of your crown.  May this reward of your
   conversation be granted you, that you may confess the Spirit perfectly
   and proclaim with us, aye and before us, all that is His due.  Yes, and
   I will venture even more on your behalf; I will even utter the
   Apostle's wish.  So much do I cling to you, and so much do I revere
   your array, and the colour of your continence, and those sacred
   assemblies, and the august Virginity, and purification, and the
   Psalmody that lasts all night [4245] and your love of the poor, and of
   the brethren, and of strangers, that I could consent to be Anathema
   from Christ, and even to suffer something as one condemned, if only you
   might stand beside us, and we might glorify the Trinity together.  For
   of the others why should I speak, seeing they are clearly dead (and it
   is the part of Christ alone to raise them, Who quickeneth the dead by
   His own Power), and are unhappily separated in place as they are bound
   together by their doctrine; and who quarrel among themselves as much as
   a pair of squinting eyes in looking at the same object, and differ with
   one another, not in sight but in position--if indeed we may charge them
   only with squinting, and not with utter blindness.  And now that I have
   to some extent laid down your position, come, let us return again to
   the subject of the Spirit, and I think you will follow me now.

   IX.  The Holy Ghost, then, always existed, and exists, and always will
   exist.  He neither had a beginning, nor will He have an end; but He was
   everlastingly ranged with and numbered with the Father and the Son.
   For it was not ever fitting that either the Son should be wanting to
   the Father, or the Spirit to the Son.  For then Deity would be shorn of
   Its Glory in its greatest respect, for It would seem to have arrived at
   the consummation of perfection as if by an afterthought.  Therefore He
   was ever being partaken, but not partaking; perfecting, not being
   perfected; sanctifying, not being sanctified; deifying, not being
   deified; Himself ever the same with Himself, and with Those with Whom
   He is ranged; invisible, eternal, incomprehensible, unchangeable,
   without quality, without quantity, without form, impalpable,
   self-moving, eternally moving, with free-will, self-powerful,
   All-powerful (even though all that is of the Spirit is referable to the
   First Cause, just as is all that is of the Only-begotten); Life and
   Lifegiver; Light and Lightgiver; absolute Good, and Spring of Goodness;
   the Right, the Princely Spirit; the Lord, the Sender, the Separator;
   Builder of His own Temple; leading, working as He wills; distributing
   His own Gifts; the Spirit of Adoption, of Truth, of Wisdom, of
   Understanding, of Knowledge, of Godliness, of Counsel, of Fear (which
   are ascribed to Him [4246] ) by Whom the Father is known and the Son is
   glorified; and by Whom alone He is known; one class, one service,
   worship, power, perfection, sanctification.  Why make a long discourse
   of it?  All that the Father hath the Son hath also, except the being
   Unbegotten; and all that the Son hath the Spirit hath also, except the
   Generation.  And these two matters do not divide the Substance, as I
   understand it, but rather are divisions within the Substance. [4247]

   X.  Are you labouring to bring forth objections?  Well, so am I to get
   on with my discourse.  Honour the Day of the Spirit; restrain your
   tongue if you can a little.  It is the time to speak of other
   tongues--reverence them or fear them, when you see that they are of
   fire.  To-day let us teach dogmatically; to-morrow we may discuss.
   To-day let us keep the feast; to-morrow will be time enough to behave
   ourselves unseemly--the first mystically, the second theatrically; the
   one in the Churches, the other in the marketplace; the one among the
   sober, the other among the drunken; the one as befits those who
   vehemently desire, the other, as among those who make a joke of the
   Spirit.  Having then put an end to the element that is foreign to us,
   let us now thoroughly furnish our own friends.

   XI.  He wrought first in the heavenly and angelic powers, and such as
   are first after God and around God.  For from no other source flows
   their perfection and their brightness, and the difficulty or
   impossibility of moving them to sin, but from the Holy Ghost.  And
   next, in the Patriarchs and Prophets, of whom the former saw Visions of
   God, or knew Him, and the latter also foreknew the future, having their
   master part moulded by the Spirit, and being associated with events
   that were yet future as if present, for such is the power of the
   Spirit.  And next in the Disciples of Christ (for I omit to mention
   Christ Himself, in Whom He dwelt, not as energizing, but as
   accompanying His Equal), and that in three ways, as they were able to
   receive Him, and on three occasions; before Christ was glorified by the
   Passion, and after He was glorified by the Resurrection; and after His
   Ascension, or Restoration, or whatever we ought to call it, to Heaven.
   Now the first of these manifests Him--the healing of the sick and
   casting out of evil spirits, which could not be apart from the Spirit;
   and so does that breathing upon them after the Resurrection, which was
   clearly a divine inspiration; and so too the present distribution of
   the fiery tongues, which we are now commemorating.  But the first
   manifested Him indistinctly, the second more expressly, this present
   one more perfectly, since He is no longer present only in energy, but
   as we may say, substantially, associating with us, and dwelling in us.
   For it was fitting that as the Son had lived with us in bodily form--so
   the Spirit too should appear in bodily form; and that after Christ had
   returned to His own place, He should have come down to us--Coming
   because He is the Lord; Sent, because He is not a rival God.  For such
   words no less manifest the Unanimity than they mark the separate
   Individuality.

   XII.  And therefore He came after Christ, that a Comforter should not
   be lacking unto us; but Another Comforter, that you might acknowledge
   His co-equality.  For this word Another marks an Alter Ego, a name of
   equal Lordship, not of inequality.  For Another is not said, I know, of
   different kinds, but of things consubstantial.  And He came in the form
   of Tongues because of His close relation to the Word.  And they were of
   Fire, perhaps because of His purifying Power (for our Scripture knows
   of a purifying fire, as any one who wishes can find out), or else
   because of His Substance.  For our God is a consuming Fire, and a Fire
   [4248] burning up the ungodly; [4249] though you may again pick a
   quarrel over these words, being brought into difficulty by the
   Consubstantiality.  And the tongues were cloven, because of the
   diversity of Gifts; and they sat to signify His Royalty and Rest among
   the Saints, and because the Cherubim are the Throne of God.  And it
   took place in an Upper Chamber (I hope I am not seeming to any one over
   tedious), because those who should receive it were to ascend and be
   raised above the earth; for also certain upper chambers [4250] are
   covered with Divine Waters, [4251] by which the praise of God are
   sung.  And Jesus Himself in an Upper Chamber gave the Communion of the
   Sacrament to those who were being initiated into the higher Mysteries,
   that thereby might be shewn on the one hand that God must come down to
   us, as I know He did of old to Moses; and on the other that we must go
   up to Him, and that so there should come to pass a Communion of God
   with men, by a coalescing of the dignity.  For as long as either
   remains on its own footing, the One in His Glory [4252] the other in
   his lowliness, so long the Goodness of God cannot mingle with us, and
   His lovingkindness is incommunicable, and there is a great gulf
   between, which cannot be crossed; and which separates not only the Rich
   Man from Lazarus and Abraham's Bosom which he longs for, but also the
   created and changing natures from that which is eternal and immutable.

   XIII.  This was proclaimed by the Prophets in such passages as the
   following:--The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; [4253] and, There shall
   rest upon Him Seven Spirits; and The Spirit of the Lord descended and
   led them; [4254] and The spirit of Knowledge filling Bezaleel, [4255]
   the Master-builder of the Tabernacle; and, The Spirit provoking to
   anger; [4256] and the Spirit carrying away Elias in a chariot, [4257]
   and sought in double measure by Elissæus; and David led and
   strengthened by the Good and Princely Spirit. [4258]   And He was
   promised by the mouth of Joel first, who said, And it shall be in the
   last days that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh (that is,
   upon all that believe), and upon your sons and upon your daughters,
   [4259] and the rest; and then afterwards by Jesus, being glorified by
   Him, and giving back glory to Him, as He was glorified by and glorified
   the Father. [4260]   And how abundant was this Promise.  He shall abide
   for ever, and shall remain with you, whether now with those who in the
   sphere of time are worthy, or hereafter with those who are counted
   worthy of that world, when we have kept Him altogether by our life
   here, and not rejected Him in so far as we sin.

   XIV.  This Spirit shares with the Son in working both the Creation and
   the Resurrection, as you may be shewn by this Scripture; By the Word of
   the Lord were the heavens made, and all the power of them by the breath
   of His Mouth; [4261] and this, The Spirit of God that made me, and the
   Breath of the Almighty that teacheth me; [4262] and again, Thou shalt
   send forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew
   the face of the earth. [4263]   And He is the Author of spiritual
   regeneration.  Here is your proof:--None can see or enter into the
   Kingdom, except he be born again of the Spirit, [4264] and be cleansed
   from the first birth, which is a mystery of the night, by a remoulding
   of the day and of the Light, by which every one singly is created
   anew.  This Spirit, for He is most wise and most loving, [4265] if He
   takes possession of a shepherd makes him a Psalmist, subduing evil
   spirits by his song, [4266] and proclaims him King; if he possess a
   goatherd and scraper [4267] of sycamore fruit, [4268] He makes him a
   Prophet.  Call to mind David and Amos.  If He possess a goodly youth,
   He makes him a Judge of Elders, [4269] even beyond his years, as Daniel
   testifies, who conquered the lions in their den. [4270]   If He takes
   possession of Fishermen, He makes them catch the whole world in the
   nets of Christ, taking them up in the meshes of the Word.  Look at
   Peter and Andrew and the Sons of Thunder, thundering the things of the
   Spirit.  If of Publicans, He makes gain of them for discipleship, and
   makes them merchants of souls; witness Matthew, yesterday a Publican,
   today an Evangelist.  If of zealous persecutors, He changes the current
   of their zeal, and makes them Pauls instead of Sauls, and as full of
   piety as He found them of wickedness.  And He is the Spirit of
   Meekness, and yet is provoked by those who sin.  Let us therefore make
   proof of Him as gentle, not as wrathful, by confessing His Dignity; and
   let us not desire to see Him implacably wrathful.  He too it is who has
   made me today a bold herald to you;--if without rest to myself, God be
   thanked; but if with risk, thanks to Him nevertheless; in the one case,
   that He may spare those that hate us; in the other, that He may
   consecrate us, in receiving this reward of our preaching of the Gospel,
   to be made perfect by blood.

   XV.  They spoke with strange tongues, and not those of their native
   land; and the wonder was great, a language spoken by those who had not
   learnt it.  And the sign is to them that believe not, [4271] and not to
   them that believe, that it may be an accusation of the unbelievers, as
   it is written, With other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this
   people, and not even so will they listen to Me [4272] saith the Lord.
   But they heard.  Here stop a little and raise a question, how you are
   to divide the words.  For the expression has an ambiguity, which is to
   be determined by the punctuation.  Did they each hear in their own
   dialect [4273] so that if I may so say, one sound was uttered, but many
   were heard; the air being thus beaten and, so to speak, sounds being
   produced more clear than the original sound; or are we to put the stop
   after "they Heard," and then to add "them speaking in their own
   languages" to what follows, so that it would be speaking in languages
   their own to the hearers, which would be foreign to the speakers?  I
   prefer to put it this latter way; for on the other plan the miracle
   would be rather of the hearers than of the speakers; whereas in this it
   would be on the speakers' side; and it was they who were reproached for
   drunkenness, evidently because they by the Spirit wrought a miracle in
   the matter of the tongues.

   XVI.  But as the old Confusion of tongues was laudable, when men who
   were of one language in wickedness and impiety, even as some now
   venture to be, were building the Tower; [4274] for by the confusion of
   their language the unity of their intention was broken up, and their
   undertaking destroyed; so much more worthy of praise is the present
   miraculous one.  For being poured from One Spirit upon many men, it
   brings them again into harmony.  And there is a diversity of Gifts,
   which stands in need of yet another Gift to discern which is the best,
   where all are praiseworthy.  And that division also might be called
   noble of which David says, Drown O Lord and divide their tongues.
   [4275]   Why?  Because they loved all words of drowning, the deceitful
   tongue. [4276]   Where he all but expressly arraigns the tongues of the
   present day [4277] which sever the Godhead.  Thus much upon this point.

   XVII.  Next, since it was to inhabitants of Jerusalem, most devout
   Jews, Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, Egyptians, and Libyans, Cretans
   too, and Arabians, and Mesopotamians, and my own Cappadocians, that the
   tongues spake, and to Jews (if any one prefer so to understand it), out
   of every nation under heaven thither collected; it is worth while to
   see who these were and of what captivity.  For the captivity in Egypt
   and Babylon was circumscribed, and moreover had long since been brought
   to an end by the Return; and that under the Romans, which was exacted
   for their audacity against our Saviour, was not yet come to pass,
   though it was in the near future.  It remains then to understand it of
   the captivity under Antiochus, which happened not so very long before
   this time.  But if any does not accept this explanation, as being too
   elaborate, seeing that this captivity was neither ancient nor
   widespread over the world, and is looking for a more reliable--perhaps
   the best way to take it would be as follows.  The nation was removed
   many times, as Esdras related; and some of the Tribes were recovered,
   and some were left behind; of whom probably (dispersed as they were
   among the nations) some would have been present and shared the miracle.

   XVIII.  These questions have been examined before by the studious, and
   perhaps not without occasion; and whatever else any one may contribute
   at the present day, he will be joined with us.  But now it is our duty
   to dissolve this Assembly, for enough has been said.  But the Festival
   is never to be put an end to; but kept now indeed with our bodies; but
   a little later on altogether spiritually there, where we shall see the
   reasons of these things more purely and clearly, in the Word Himself,
   and God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the True Festival and Rejoicing of
   the Saved--to Whom be the glory and the worship, with the Father and
   the Holy Ghost, now and for ever.  Amen.

   [4205] They deify bad passions, and then act as if the gratification of
   them were an honour to the gods in whom they have personified them.

   [4206] The followers of Pythagoras swore by their master, who taught
   them the mystic properties of the number Four, which he called the
   Fountain of the Universe, because all things were made of four
   elements.

   [4207] The Simonians and Marcionites were two Gnostic sects, the one
   deriving its name from Simon Magus, the other from Marcion of Sinope.
   Simon, of whom we read in the Acts c. viii., is generally regarded by
   the Fathers as the precursor of the Gnostic Heresies.  He maintained a
   system of Emanations from God, of which he claimed to be himself the
   chief.  In his teaching the first cause of all things was an Ineffable
   Existence or Non-existence, which he sometimes called Silence and
   sometimes Fire, from which the Universe was generated by a series of
   six Emanations called Roots, which he arranged in pairs, male and
   female; and these six contained among them the whole Essence of his
   first Principle Silence.  These Roots with Simon himself and his
   consort Helena, make up the Ogdoad referred to in the text. Marcion was
   a native of Sinope in Pontus, and flourished about the middle of the
   Second Century.  His system of teaching was mainly rationalistic, and
   did not recognize (Dr. Mansel tells us, "Gnostic Heresies," p. 203) any
   theory of Emanations as connecting links between God and the world; for
   from his point of view the Supreme God was not, even indirectly, the
   Author of the world.  It would seem that S. Gregory is confusing
   Marcion with Valentinus, and Egyptian heresiarch who flourished about
   the same time.  In his theory we first find a system of "Æons," divided
   into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Dodecad.  Or he may mean Marcus, a
   follower of Valentinus, and founder of the subordinate sect of the
   Marcosians.

   almsgiving.  S. Ambrose (in Luc. vi.) has a mystical interpretation
   somewhat resembling that here referred to:  but I cannot find a
   predecessor of Gregory on the verse.  Some later commentators,
   according to Cornelius and Lapide, take the Seven of the poor in this
   life, and the Eight of the souls in Purgatory, following a common
   interpretation of these numbers.

   [4216] It will be worth while, says Nicetas, to add S. John
   Chrysostom's account of the sevenfold punishment which was inflicted on
   Cain.  The number Seven he says (Hom. in Gen. xix. 5, p. 168 c.) is
   often used in Holy Scripture in the sense of multitude, as e.g., in
   such places, as, "The barren hath borne seven," and the like.  So here;
   the greatness of the crime is implied, and that it is not a simple and
   single crime, but seven sins; and those of such a sort that every one
   of them must be avenged by a very severe punishment.  First, that he
   envied his brother when he saw that God loved him, a sin which without
   any other added to it was sufficient to be deadly.  The next was that
   this sin was against a brother.  The third that he compassed a deceit.
   The fourth that he perpetrated a murder.  The fifth that it was his
   brother that he slew.  The sixth that he was the first man to commit a
   murder.  The seventh that he lied to God.  You have followed these
   steps with your mind, or do you desire that I should repeat the
   enumeration in a fuller way, to make you understand how each of these
   sins would be visited with a very severe penalty, even if it stood
   alone.  Who would judge a man worthy of pardon who envies another
   simply because he enjoys the favour and love of God?  Here then is one
   very great and inexpiable sin.  And this is shewn to be even more
   atrocious when he who is envied is a brother, and has done him no
   wrong.  Further, he contrived a deceit, bringing his brother out by a
   trick into the field, without reverence for nature herself.  The fourth
   crime is the murder which he committed.  The fifth is that it was his
   brother whom he put to death; his brother, I say, that came out of the
   same womb.  Sixthly, he was the first inventor of murder.  Seventhly,
   when questioned by God he did not hesitate to lie.  And therefore
   because he dared to lay hands on his brother, he draws upon himself
   severe punishments.  He then proceeds to shew how Lamech's crime was
   worse than Cain's, and is therefore said to be punished seventy times;
   that is, in manifold ways.  Lamech slew a man and a young man, and
   this, after the law against murder had been given; that is, after God
   had punished Cain.  Cain's punishment he says was sevenfold,
   corresponding to his seven sins:--1. Cursed is the ground for thy
   sake.  2. Thou shalt till the ground; i.e., thou shalt never rest from
   the toils of husbandry.  3. It shall not yield unto thee its strength;
   4. thy labours shall be barren, and 5. "sighing and trembling" shalt
   thou be.  And the sixth is from the lips of Cain himself:--"If Thou
   castest me out from the earth," i.e., from all earthly conveniences,
   "from Thy face shall I be hid."  And God put a mark upon Cain; this is
   the seventh punishment--a mark of infamy declaring his guilt and shame
   to all that should see him.  Others according to the same authority
   (and Bishop Wordsworth adopts the explanation) explains it thus.  From
   Cain to the Deluge are seven generations, and then the world was
   punished because sin had spread far and wide.  But Lamech's sin could
   not be cured by the Deluge, but only by Him Who taketh away the sin of
   the world.  Then count all the generations from Adam to Christ, and
   according to the Genealogy in Luke, you will find that our Lord was
   born in the seventieth generation.  This is S. Jerome's explanation.

   perfect number.  (Six because it is the sum of its own factors, 1, 2,
   3; Ten, because it is the basis of numeration; Seven because it is the
   number of Creation; for God rested on the Sabbath Day.).

   the child (in Cant. xvi).

   [4236] S. Gregory makes this explanation because there were certain
   heretics who taught that our Lord at His Ascension laid aside His
   Humanity.  It is said that this was held by certain Manichæans, who
   based their idea on Ps. xix. 4, where the LXX. and Vulgate read, "He

   [4238] The reference is to the Macedonians or Pneumatomachi, followers
   of Macedonius, Patriarch of Constantinople, who had passed from extreme
   or Anomoean Arianism to Semi-Arianism, and was forcibly intruded on the
   See by order of Constantius in 343, but was afterwards deposed.  After
   his deposition he broached the heresy known by his name, denying the
   Deity of the Holy Ghost; some of its adherents, with Macedonius
   himself, maintaining Him to be a mere creature; others stopping short
   of this; and others calling Him a creature and servant of the Son.  The
   heresy was formally condemned in the Ecumenical Council of
   Constantinople in 381.

   [4239] John iii. 8.

   [4240] S. Gregory here commends the practice of reserve in respect of
   the Deity of the Holy Ghost.  To believe it is necessary to salvation,
   he would say; but in view of the prevailing ignorance it is well to be
   careful before whom we give Him the Name of God.  But he demands that
   his hearers should give to the Holy Ghost all the Attributes of
   Godhead, and should bear with those who, like himself, gave Him also
   the Name, as he prays that they all may have grace to do (Bénoît).

   point to the passive sense of Majesty or Glory.  The word is not in the
   Lexicon, and Suicer does not notice it; but the corresponding adjective
   has only the passive sense.  Specula, however, is used in the sense of
   Eminence, but apparently only geographically.

   Oration XLII.

   The Last Farewell in the Presence of the One Hundred and Fifty Bishops.

   ThisOration was delivered during the Second OEcumenical Council, held
   at Constantinople a.d. 381.  Historical as well as personal motives
   render the occasion of the deepest interest.  The audience consisted of
   the one hundred and fifty Bishops of the Eastern Church who took part
   in the Council, and of the speaker's own flock, the orthodox Christians
   of Constantinople.  He had by his own exertions gathered that flock
   together, after it had been ravaged by heretical teachers.  He had won
   the admiration and affection of its members, by his courageous
   championship of the Faith, his lucid teaching, and his fatherly care
   for their spiritual needs.  He had been, against his will, enthroned
   with acclamation in the highest ecclesiastical position in the Eastern
   Church, and called to preside over the Synod of its assembled Bishops.
   Finding himself unable to guide the deliberations of the Council in
   regard to a question of the highest importance, and perceiving that he
   himself and his position were made by some of the Bishops a fresh cause
   of dissension, he felt bound to resign his high office, and endeavour
   by this personal sacrifice to restore peace to the Church.  His
   language is worthy of the occasion.  Obliged to deal with the topics
   which had caused dissension, he handles them with gentle and
   discriminating tact; he speaks with great self-restraint in his own
   defence; he sets forth with tenderest feeling the common experiences of
   himself and his flock;  he gives with dignity and clearness his last
   public exposition of the Faith; and finally, in language of exquisite
   beauty, spoken with the quivering tones of an aged man, he bids a
   tender farewell to his flock, his cathedral, and his throne, with all
   their affecting associations.  It was an occasion whose pathos is
   unsurpassed in history.  Orator and audience were alike deeply moved,
   and the emotion has been renewed in all those who have read his words,
   and realised the scene of their delivery.

   1.  What think ye of our affairs, dear shepherds and fellow-shepherds:
   whose feet are beautiful, for you bring glad tidings of peace and of
   the good things [4278] with which ye have come; beautiful again in our
   eyes, to whom ye have come in season, not to convert a wandering sheep,
   [4279] but to converse with a pilgrim shepherd?  What think ye of this
   our pilgrimage?  And of its fruit, or rather of that of the Spirit
   [4280] within us, [4281] by Whom we are ever moved, [4282] and
   specially have now been moved, desiring to have, and perhaps having,
   nothing of our own?  Do you of yourselves understand and perceive--and
   are you kindly critics of our actions?  Or must we, like those from
   whom a reckoning is demanded as to their military command, or civil
   government, or administration of the exchequer, publicly and in person
   submit to you the accounts of our administration?  Not indeed that we
   are ashamed of being judged, for we are ourselves judges in turn, and
   both with the same charity.  But the law is an ancient one:  for even
   Paul communicated to the Apostles his Gospel: [4283]   not for the sake
   of ostentation, for the Spirit is far removed from all ostentation, but
   in order to establish his success and correct his failure, if indeed
   there were any such in his words or actions, as he declares when
   writing of himself.  Since even the Spirits of the Prophets are subject
   to the prophets, [4284] according to the order of the Spirit who
   regulates and divides all things well.  And do not wonder that, while
   he rendered his account privately and to some, I do so publicly, and to
   all.  For my need is greater than his, of being aided by the freedom of
   my censors, if I am proved to have failed in my duty, lest I should
   run, or have run, in vain. [4285]   And the only possible mode of
   self-defence is speech in the presence of men who know the facts.

   2.  What then is my defence? [4286]   If it be false, you must convict
   me, but if true, you on behalf of whom [4287] and in whose presence I
   speak, must bear witness to it.  For you are my defence, my witnesses,
   and my crown of rejoicing, [4288] if I also may venture to boast myself
   a little in the Apostle's language.  This flock was, when it was small
   and poor, as far as appearances went, nay, not even a flock, but a
   slight trace and relic of a flock, without order, or shepherd, or
   bounds, with neither right to pasturage, nor the defence of a fold,
   wandering upon the mountains and in caves and dens of the earth, [4289]
   scattered and dispersed hither and thither as each one could find
   shelter or pasture, or could gratefully secure its own safety; like
   that flock which was harassed by lions, dispersed by tempest, or
   scattered in darkness, the lamentation of prophets who compared it to
   the misfortunes of Israel, [4290] given up to the Gentiles; over which
   we also lamented, so long as our lot was worthy of lamentation.  For in
   very deed we also were thrust out and cast off, and scattered upon
   every mountain and hill, from the need of a shepherd: [4291]   and a
   dreadful storm fell upon the Church, and fearful beasts assailed her,
   who do not even now, after the calm, spare us, but without being
   ashamed of themselves, wield a greater power than the time should
   allow; while a gloomy darkness, far more oppressive than the ninth
   plague of Egypt, the darkness which might be felt, [4292] enveloped and
   concealed everything, so that we could scarcely even see one another.

   3.  To speak in a more feeling strain, trusting in Him Who then forsook
   me, as in a Father, "Abraham has been ignorant of us, Israel has
   acknowledged us not, but Thou art our Father, and unto Thee do we look;
   [4293] beside Thee we know none else, we make mention of Thy name."
   [4294]   Therefore, says Jeremiah, I will plead with Thee, I will
   reason the cause with Thee. [4295]   We are become as at the beginning,
   when Thou barest not rule [4296] over us, and Thou hast forgotten Thy
   holy covenant, and shut up Thy mercies from us.  Therefore we, the
   worshippers of the Trinity, the perfect suppliants of the perfect
   Deity, became a reproach to Thy Beloved, neither daring to bring down
   to our own level any of the things above us, nor in such wise to rise
   up against the godless tongues which fought against God, as to make His
   Majesty a fellow servant with ourselves; but, as is plain, we were
   delivered up on account of our other sins, and because our conduct had
   been unworthy of Thy commandments, and we had walked after our own evil
   mind.  For what other reason can there be for our being delivered up to
   the most unrighteous and wicked men of all the dwellers upon the
   earth?  First Nebuchadnezzar [4297] afflicted us, [4298] possessed
   during the Christian era with an anti-Christian rage, hating Christ
   just because he had through Him gained salvation, and having bartered
   the sacred books for sacrifices to those who are no gods.  He devoured
   me, he tore me in pieces, a slight darkness enveloped me, [4299] if I
   may even in my lamentation keep to the language of Scripture.  If the
   Lord had not helped me, [4300] and righteously delivered him to the
   hands of the lawless, by casting him off (such are the judgments of
   God) to the Persians, by whom his blood was righteously shed for his
   unholy sheddings of blood, since in this case alone justice could not
   afford even to be longsuffering, my soul had shortly dwelt in the
   grave. [4301]   The second [4302] no more kindly, if he were not even
   more grievous still, for while he bore the name of Christ, he was a
   false Christ, and at once a burden and a reproach to the Christians,
   for, while to obey him was ungodly, to suffer at his hands was
   inglorious, since they did not even seem to be wronged, nor to gain by
   their sufferings the glorious title of martyr, inasmuch as the truth
   was in this case perverted, for while they suffered as Christians, they
   were supposed to be punished as heretics.  Alas! how rich we were in
   misfortunes, for the fire consumed the beauties of the world. [4303]
   That which the palmerworm left did the locust eat, and that which the
   locust left did the caterpillar eat:  then came the cankerworm, [4304]
   then, what next I know not, one evil springing up after another.  But
   for what purpose should I give a tragic description of the evils of the
   time, and of the penalty exacted from us, or, if I must rather call it
   so, the testing and refining we endured?  At any rate, we went through
   fire and water, [4305] and have attained a place of refreshment by the
   good pleasure of God our Saviour.

   4.  To return to my original startingpoint.  This was my field, when it
   was small and poor, unworthy not only of God, Who has been, and is
   cultivating the whole world with the fair seeds and doctrines of piety,
   but, apparently, even of any poor and needy man of slender means.  Nay
   it did not deserve to be called a field, requiring neither barn nor
   threshing-floor, and not even worthy of the sickle; with neither heap
   nor sheaves, or small and untimely sheaves, like those on the housetop,
   which do not fill the hand of the reaper, nor call forth a blessing
   from them which go by. [4306]   Such was my field, such my harvest;
   great and well-eared and fat in the eyes of Him Who beholdeth hidden
   things, and becoming such a husbandman, its abundance springing from
   the valleys of souls well tilled with the Word:  unrecognized however
   in public, and not collected together, but gathered in fragments, as an
   ear gleaned in the stubble, [4307] as gleaning-grapes in the vintage,
   where there is no cluster left.  I think I may add, only too
   appropriately, I found Israel like a figtree in the wilderness, [4308]
   and like one or two ripe grapes in an unripe cluster, preserved as a
   blessing from the Lord, [4309] and a consecrated firstfruit, though
   small as yet and scanty, and not filling the mouth of the eater:  and
   as an ensign on a hill, [4310] and as a beacon on a mountain, or any
   other solitary thing visible only to few.  Such was its former poverty
   and dejection.

   5.  But since God, Who maketh poor and maketh rich, Who killeth and
   maketh alive; [4311] Who maketh and transformeth all things; Who
   turneth night into day, [4312] winter into spring, storm into calm,
   drought into abundance of rain; and often for the sake of the prayers
   [4313] of one righteous man [4314] sorely persecuted; Who lifteth up
   the meek on high, and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground; [4315]
   since God said to Himself, I have surely seen the affliction of Israel;
   [4316] and they shall no longer be further vexed with clay and
   brick-making; and when He spake He visited, and in His visitation He
   saved, and led forth His people with a mighty hand and outstretched
   arm, [4317] by the hand of Moses and Aaron, [4318] His chosen--what is
   the result, and what wonders have been wrought?  Those which books and
   monuments contain.  For besides all the wonders by the way, and that
   mighty roar, to speak most concisely, Joseph came into Egypt alone,
   [4319] and soon after six hundred thousand depart from Egypt. [4320]
   What more marvellous than this?  What greater proof of the generosity
   of God, when from men without means He wills to supply the means for
   public affairs?  And the land of promise is distributed through one who
   was hated, and he who was sold [4321] dispossesses nations, and is
   himself made a great nation, and that small offshoot becomes a
   luxuriant vine, [4322] so great that it reaches to the river, and is
   stretched out to the sea, [4323] and spreads from border to border, and
   hides the mountains with the height of its glory and is exalted above
   the cedars, even the cedars of God, whatever we are to take these
   mountains and cedars to be.

   6.  Such then was once this flock, and such it is now, so healthy and
   well grown, and if it be not yet in perfection, it is advancing towards
   it by constant increase, and I prophesy that it will advance.  This is
   foretold me by the Holy Spirit, if I have any prophetic instinct and
   insight into the future.  And from what has preceded I am able to be
   confident, and recognize this by reasoning, being the nursling of
   reason.  For it was much more improbable that, from that condition, it
   should reach its present development, than that, as it now is, it
   should attain to the height of renown.  For ever since it began to be
   gathered together, by Him Who quickeneth the dead, [4324] bone to its
   bone, joint to joint, and the Spirit of life and regeneration was given
   to it in their dryness, [4325] its entire resurrection has been, I know
   well, sure to be fulfilled:  so that the rebellious should not exalt
   themselves, [4326] and that those who grasp at a shadow, or at a dream
   when one awaketh, [4327] or at the dispersing breezes, or at the traces
   of a ship in the water, [4328] should not think that they have
   anything.  Howl, firtree, for the cedar is fallen! [4329]   Let them be
   instructed by the misfortunes of others, and learn that the poor shall
   not alway be forgotten, [4330] and that the Deity will not refrain, as
   Habakkuk says, from striking through the heads of the mighty ones
   [4331] in His fury--the Deity, Who has been struck through and
   impiously divided into Ruler and Ruled, in order to insult the Deity in
   the highest degree by degrading It, and oppress a creature by equality
   with Deity.

   7.  I seem indeed to hear that voice, from Him Who gathers together
   those who are broken, and welcomes the oppressed:  Enlarge thy cords,
   break forth on the right hand and on the left, drive in thy stakes,
   spare not thy curtains. [4332]   I have given thee up, and I will help
   thee.  In a little wrath I smote thee, but with everlasting mercy I
   will glorify thee. [4333]   The measure of His kindness exceeds the
   measure of His discipline.  The former things were owing to our
   wickedness, the present things to the adorable Trinity:  the former for
   our cleansing, the present for My glory, Who will glorify them that
   glorify Me, [4334] and I will move to jealousy them that move Me to
   jealousy.  Behold this is sealed up with Me, [4335] and this is the
   indissoluble law of recompense.  But thou didst surround thyself with
   walls and tablets and richly set stones, and long porticos and
   galleries, and didst shine and sparkle with gold, which thou didst, in
   part pour forth like water, in part treasure up like sand; not knowing
   that better is faith, with no other roof but the sky to cover it, than
   impiety rolling in wealth, and that three gathered together in the Name
   of the Lord [4336] count for more with God than tens of thousands of
   those who deny the Godhead.  Would you prefer the whole of the
   Canaanites to Abraham alone? [4337] or the men of Sodom to Lot? [4338]
   or the Midianites to Moses, [4339] when each of these was a pilgrim and
   a stranger?  How do the three hundred men with Gideon, who bravely
   lapped, [4340] compare with the thousands who were put to flight?  Or
   the servants of Abraham, who scarcely exceeded them in number, with the
   many kings and the army of tens of thousands whom, few as they were,
   they overtook and defeated? [4341]   Or how do you understand the
   passage that though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand
   of the sea, a remnant shall be saved? [4342]   And again, I have left
   me seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal? [4343]
   This is not the case; it is not?  God has not taken pleasure in
   numbers.

   8.  Thou countest tens of thousands, God counts those who are in a
   state of salvation; thou countest the dust which is without number, I
   the vessels of election.  For nothing is so magnificent in God's sight
   as pure doctrine, and a soul perfect in all the dogmas of the
   truth.--For there is nothing worthy of Him Who made all things, of Him
   by Whom are all things, and for Whom are all things, [4344] so that it
   can be given or offered to God:  not merely the handiwork or means of
   any individual, but even if we wished to honour Him, by uniting
   together all the property and handiwork of all mankind.  Do not I fill
   heaven and earth? [4345] saith the Lord! and what house will ye build
   Me? or what is the place of My rest? [4346]   But, since man must needs
   fall short of what is worthy, I ask of you, as approaching it most
   nearly, piety, the wealth which is common to all and equal in My eyes,
   wherein the poorest may, if he be nobleminded, surpass the most
   illustrious.  For this kind of glory depends upon purpose, not upon
   affluence.  These things be well assured, I will accept at your hands.
   [4347]   To tread [4348] My courts ye shall not proceed, but the feet
   of the meek [4349] shall tread them, who have duly and sincerely
   acknowledged Me, and My only-begotten Word, and the Holy Spirit.  How
   long will ye inherit My holy Mountain? [4350]   How long shall My ark
   be among the heathen? [4351]   Now for a little longer ye indulge
   yourselves in that which belongs to others, and gratify your desires.
   For as ye have devised to reject Me, so will I also reject you, [4352]
   saith the Lord Almighty.

   9.  This I seemed to hear Him say, and to see Him do, and besides, to
   hear Him shouting to His people, which once were few and scattered and
   miserable, and have now become many, and compact enough and enviable,
   Go through [4353] My gates [4354] and be ye enlarged.  Must you always
   be in trouble and dwell in tents, while those who vex you rejoice
   exceedingly?  And to the presiding Angels, for I believe, as John
   teaches me in his Revelation, that each Church has its guardian, [4355]
   Prepare ye the way of My people, and cast away the stones from the way,
   [4356] that there may be no stumblingblock or hindrance for the people
   [4357] in the divine road and entrance, now, to the temples made with
   hands, [4358] but soon after, to Jerusalem above, [4359] and the Holy
   of holies there, [4360] which will, I know, be the end of suffering and
   struggle to those who here bravely travel on the way.  Among whom are
   ye also called to be Saints, [4361] a people of possession, a royal
   priesthood, [4362] the most excellent portion of the Lord, a whole
   river from a drop, a heavenly lamp from a spark, a tree from a grain of
   mustard seed, [4363] on which the birds come and lodge.

   10.  These we present to you, dear shepherds, these we offer to you,
   with these we welcome our friends, and guests, and fellow pilgrims.  We
   have nothing fairer or more splendid to offer to you, for we have
   selected the greatest of all our possessions, that you may see that,
   strangers as we are, we are not in want, but though poor are making
   many rich. [4364]   If these things are small and unworthy of notice, I
   would fain learn what is greater and of more account.  For, if it be no
   great thing to have established and strengthened with wholesome
   doctrines a city which is the eye of the universe, in its exceeding
   strength by sea and land, which is, as it were, the link between the
   Eastern and Western shores, in which the extremities of the world from
   every side meet together, and from which, as the common mart of the
   faith, they take their rise, a city borne hither and thither on the
   eddying currents of so many tongues, it will be long ere anything be
   considered great or worthy of esteem.  But if it be indeed a subject
   for praise, allow to us some glory on this account, since we have
   contributed in some portion to these results which ye see.

   11.  Lift up thine eyes round about, and see, [4365] thou critic of my
   words!  See the crown which has been platted in return for the
   hirelings of Ephraim [4366] and the crown of insolence; see the
   assembly of the presbyters, honoured for years and wisdom, the fair
   order of the deacons, who are not far from the same Spirit, the good
   conduct of the readers, the people's eagerness for teaching, both of
   men and women, who are equally renowned for virtue:  the men, whether
   philosophers or simple folk, being alike wise in divine things, whether
   rulers or ruled, being all in this respect duly under rule; whether
   soldiers or nobles, students or men of letters, being all soldiers
   [4367] of God, though in all other respects meek, ready to fight for
   the Spirit, all reverencing the assembly above, to which we obtain an
   entrance, not by the mere letter, but by the quickening Spirit, all in
   very deed being men of reason, and worshippers of Him Who is in truth
   the Word:  the women, if married, being united by a Divine rather than
   by a carnal bond; if unwedded and free, being entirely dedicated to
   God; whether young or old, some honourably advancing towards old age,
   others eagerly striving to remain immortal, being renewed by the best
   of hopes.

   12.  To those who platted this crown--that which I speak, I speak it
   not after the Lord, [4368] nevertheless I will say it--I also have
   given assistance.  Some of them are the result of my words, not of
   those which we have uttered at random, but of those which we have
   loved--nor again of those which are meretricious, though the language
   and manners of the harlot have been slanderously attributed to me, but
   of those which are most grave.  Some of them are the offspring and
   fruit of my Spirit, as the Spirit can beget those who rise superior to
   the body.  To this I have no doubt that those who are kindly among you,
   nay all of you, will testify, since I have been the husbandman of all:
   and my sole reward is your confession.  For we neither have, nor have
   had, any other object.  For virtue, that it may remain virtue, is
   without reward, its eyes fixed alone on that which is good.

   13.  Would you have me say something still more venturesome?  Do you
   see the tongues of the enemy made gentle, and those who made war upon
   the Godhead against me tranquillised?  This also is the result of our
   Spirit, of our husbandry.  For we are not undisciplined in our exercise
   of discipline, nor do we hurl insults, as many do, who assail not the
   argument but the speaker, and sometimes strive by their invective to
   hide the weakness of their reasoning; as the cuttlefish are said to
   cast forth ink before them, in order to escape from their pursuers, or
   themselves to hunt others when unperceived.  But we show that our
   warfare is in behalf of Christ by fighting as Christ, the peaceable and
   meek, [4369] Who has borne our infirmities, fought. [4370]   Though
   peaceable, we do not injure the word of truth, by yielding a jot, to
   gain a reputation for reasonableness; for we do not pursue that which
   is good by means of ill:  and we are peaceable by the legitimate
   character of our warfare, confined as it is to our own limits, and the
   rules of the Spirit.  Upon these points, this is my decision, and I lay
   down the law for all stewards of souls and dispensers of the Word:
   neither to exasperate others by their harshness, nor to render them
   arrogant by submissiveness:  but to be of good words in treating of the
   Word, and in neither direction to overstep the mean.

   14.  But you are perhaps longing for me to give an exposition of the
   faith, in so far as I am able.  For I shall myself be sanctified by the
   effort of memory, and the people also will be benefited, by its special
   delight in such discussions, and you will fully acknowledge it--unless
   we are the objects of groundless envy, as the rivals, in the
   manifestation of the truth, of those whom we do not excel.  For as, of
   deep waters, some in the depths are utterly hidden, some foam against
   any obstruction, and hesitate a while before breaking (as they promise
   to our ears), some do actually break; so also, of those who are
   professors of the Divine philosophy--setting aside the utterly
   misguided--some keep their piety entirely secret and hidden within
   themselves, some are not far from the birth pangs, avoiding impiety,
   yet not speaking out their piety, either from cautious reserve in their
   teaching, or under pressure of fear, being themselves sound, as they
   say, in mind, but not making sound their people, as if they had been
   entrusted with the government of their own souls, but not of those of
   others; while there are some who make public their treasure, unable to
   restrain themselves from giving birth to their piety, and not
   considering that to be salvation which saves themselves alone, without
   bestowing upon others the overflow of their blessings.  Among these
   would I range myself, and all who by my side have nobly dared to
   confess the truth.

   15.  One concise proclamation of our teaching, an inscription
   intelligible to all, is this people, which so sincerely worships the
   Trinity, that it would sooner sever anyone from this life, than sever
   one of the three from the Godhead:  of one mind, of equal zeal, and
   united to one another, to us and to the Trinity by unity of doctrine.
   Briefly to run over its details:  That which is without beginning, and
   is the beginning, and is with the beginning, is one God.  For the
   nature of that which is without beginning does not consist in being
   without beginning or being unbegotten, for the nature of anything lies,
   not in what it is not but in what it is.  It is the assertion of what
   is, not the denial of what is not.  And the Beginning is not, because
   it is a beginning, separated from that which has no beginning.  For its
   beginning is not its nature, any more than the being without beginning
   is the nature of the other.  For these are the accompaniments of the
   nature, not the nature itself.  That again which is with that which has
   no beginning, and with the beginning, is not anything else than what
   they are.  Now, the name of that which has no beginning is the Father,
   and of the Beginning the Son, and of that which is with the Beginning,
   the Holy Ghost, and the three have one Nature--God.  And the union is
   the Father from Whom and to Whom the order of Persons runs its course,
   not so as to be confounded, but so as to be possessed, without
   distinction of time, of will, or of power.  For these things in our
   case produce a plurality of individuals, since each of them is separate
   both from every other quality, and from every other individual
   possession of the same quality.  But to Those who have a simple nature,
   and whose essence is the same, the term One belongs in its highest
   sense.

   16.  Let us then bid farewell to all contentious shiftings and
   balancings of the truth on either side, neither, like the Sabellians,
   assailing the Trinity in the interest of the Unity, and so destroying
   the distinction by a wicked confusion; nor, like the Arians, assailing
   the Unity in the interest of the Trinity, and by an impious distinction
   overthrowing the Oneness.  For our object is not to exchange one evil
   for another, but to ensure our attainment of that which is good.  These
   are the playthings of the Wicked One, who is ever swaying our fortunes
   towards the evil.  But we, walking along the royal road which lies
   between the two extremes, which is the seat of the virtues, as the
   authorities say, believe in the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, of
   one Substance and glory; in Whom also baptism has its perfection, both
   nominally and really (thou knowest who hast been initiated!); being a
   denial of atheism and a confession of Godhead; and thus we are
   regenerated, acknowledging the Unity in the Essence and in the
   undivided worship, and the Trinity in the Hypostases or Persons (which
   term some prefer.)  And let not those who are contentious on these
   points utter their scandalous taunts, as if our faith depended on terms
   and not on realities.  For what do you mean who assert the three
   Hypostases?  Do you imply three Essences by the term?  I am assured
   that you would loudly shout against those who do so.  For you teach
   that the Essence of the Three is One and the same.  What do you mean,
   who assert the Three Persons?  Do you imagine a single compound sort of
   being, with three faces, [4371] or of an entirely human form?  Perish
   the thought!  You too will loudly reply that he who thinks thus, will
   never see the face of God, whatever it may be.  What is the meaning of
   the Hypostases of the one party, of the Persons of the other, to ask
   this further question?  That They are three, Who are distinguished not
   by natures, but by properties. [4372]   Excellent.  How could men agree
   and harmonize better than you do, even if there be a difference between
   the syllables you use?  You see what a reconciler I am, bringing you
   back from the letter to the sense, as we do with the Old and New
   Testaments.

   17.  But, to resume:  let us speak of the Unbegotten, the Begotten, and
   the Proceeding, if anyone likes to create names:  for we shall have no
   fear of bodily conceptions attaching to Those who are not embodied, as
   the calumniators of the Godhead think.  For the creature must be called
   God's, and this is for us a great thing, but God never.  Otherwise I
   shall admit that God is a creature, if I become God, in the strict
   sense of the term.  For this is the truth.  If God, He is not a
   creature; for the creature ranks with us who are not Gods.  And if a
   creature, he is not God, for he had a beginning in time.  And there was
   a time when he who had a beginning was not.  And that of which
   non-existence was its prior condition, has not being in the strict
   sense of the term.  And how can that, which strictly has not being, be
   God?  Not one single one, then, of the Three is a creature, nor, what
   is worse, came into being for my sake; for in that case he would be not
   only a creature, but inferior in honour to us.  For, if I am for the
   glory of God, and he is for my sake, as the tongs for the waggon, the
   saw for the door, I am his superior in causality.  For in whatever
   degree God is superior to creatures, in the same degree is he, who came
   into being for my sake, inferior to me who exist for God's sake.

   18.  Moreover, the Moabites and Ammonites must not even be allowed to
   enter [4373] into the Church of God, I mean those sophistical,
   mischievous arguments which enquire curiously into the generation and
   inexpressible procession of God, and rashly set themselves in array
   against the Godhead:  as if it were necessary that those things which
   it is beyond the power of language to set forth, must either be
   accessible to them alone, or else have no existence because they have
   not comprehended them.  We however, following the Divine Scriptures,
   and removing out of the way of the blind the stumbling blocks contained
   in them, will cling to salvation, daring any and every thing rather
   than arrogance against God.  As for the evidences, we leave them to
   others, since they have been set forth by many, and by ourselves also
   with no little care.  And indeed, it would be a very shameful thing for
   me at this time to be gathering together proofs for what has all along
   been believed.  For it is not the best order of things, first to teach
   and then to learn, even in matters which are small and of no
   consequence, and much more in those which are Divine and of such great
   importance.  Nor, again, is it proper to the present occasion to
   explain and disentangle the difficulties of Scripture, a task requiring
   fuller and more careful consideration than our present purpose will
   allow.  Such then, to sum up, is our teaching.  I have entered into
   these details, with no intention of contending against the
   adversaries:  for I have already often, even if it be imperfectly,
   fought out the question with them:  but in order that I might exhibit
   to you the character of my teaching, that you might see whether I have
   not a share in the defence of your own, and do not take my stand on the
   same side, and opposed to the same enemies as yourselves.

   19.  You have now, my friends, heard the defence of my presence here:
   if it be deserving of praise, thanks are due for it to God, and to you
   who called me; if it has fallen below your expectation, I give thanks
   even on this behalf.  For I am assured that it has not been altogether
   deserving of censure, and am confident that you also admit this.  Have
   we at all made a gain [4374] of this people?  Have we consulted at all
   our own interests, as I see is most often the case?  Have we caused any
   vexation to the Church?  To others possibly, with whose idea that they
   had gained judgment against us by default, we have joined issue in our
   argument; but in no wise, as far as I am aware, to you.  I have taken
   no ox of yours, [4375] says the great Samuel, in his contention against
   Israel on the subject of the king, nor any propitiation for your souls,
   the Lord is witness among you, nor this, nor that, proceeding at
   greater length, that I may not count up every particular; but I have
   kept the priesthood pure and unalloyed.  And if I have loved power, or
   the height of a throne, or to tread Kings' courts, may I never possess
   any distinction, or if I gain it, may I be hurled from it.

   20.  What then do I mean?  I am no proficient in virtue without reward,
   having not attained to so high a degree of virtue.  Give me the reward
   of my labours.  What reward?  Not that which some, prone to any
   suspicion would suppose, but that which it is safe for me to seek.
   Give me a respite from my long labours; give honour to my foreign
   service; elect another in my place, the one who is being eagerly sought
   on your behalf, someone who is clean of hands, someone who is not
   unskilled in voice, someone who is able to gratify you on all points,
   and share with you the ecclesiastical cares; for this is especially the
   time for such.  But behold, I pray you, the condition of this body, so
   drained by time, by disease, by toil.  What need have you of a timid
   and unmanly old man, who is, so to speak, dying day by day, not only in
   body, but even in powers of mind, who finds it difficult to enter into
   these details before you?  Disobey not the voice of your teacher:  for
   indeed you have never yet disobeyed it.  I am weary of being charged
   with my gentleness.  I am weary of being assailed in words and in envy
   by enemies, and by our own.  Some aim at my breast, and are less
   successful in their effort, for an open enemy can be guarded against.
   Others lie in wait for my back, and give greater pain, for the
   unsuspected blow is the more fatal.  If again I have been a pilot, I
   have been one of the most skilful; the sea has been boisterous around
   us, boiling about the ship, and there has been considerable uproar
   among the passengers, who have always been fighting about something or
   another, and roaring against one another and the waves.  What a
   struggle I have had, seated at the helm, contending alike with the sea
   and the passengers, to bring the vessel safe to land through this
   double storm?  Had they in every way supported me, safety would have
   been hardly won, and when they were opposed to me, how has it been
   possible to avoid making shipwreck?

   21.  What more need be said?  But how can I bear this holy war?  For
   there has been said to be a holy, as well as a Persian, war. [4376]
   How shall I unite and join together the hostile occupants of sees, and
   hostile pastors, and the people broken up along with, and opposed to
   them, as if by some chasms caused by earthquakes between neighbouring
   and adjoining places; or as, in pestilential diseases, befalls servants
   and members of the family, when the sickness readily attacks in
   succession one after another; and besides the very quarters of the
   globe are affected by the spirit of faction, so that East and West are
   arrayed on opposite sides, and bid fair to be severed in opinion no
   less than in position.  How long are parties to be mine and yours, the
   old and the new, the more rational and the more spiritual, the more
   noble and the more ignoble, the more and the less numerous?  I am
   ashamed of my old age, when, after being saved by Christ, I am called
   by the name of others.

   22. [4377]   I cannot bear your horse races and theatres, and this rage
   for rivalry in expense and party spirit.  We unharness, and harness
   ourselves on the other side, we neigh against each other, we almost
   beat the air, as they do, and fling the dust towards heaven, like those
   which are excited; and under other masks satisfy our own rivalry, and
   become evil arbiters of emulation, and senseless judges of affairs.
   To-day sharing the same thrones and opinions, if our leaders thus carry
   us along; to-morrow hostile alike in position and opinion, if the wind
   blows in the contrary direction.  Amid the variations of friendship and
   hatred, our names also vary:  and what is most terrible, we are not
   ashamed to set forth contrary doctrines to the same audience; nor are
   we constant to the same objects, being rendered different at different
   times by our contentiousness.  They are like the ebb and flow of some
   narrow strait. [4378]   For as when the children are at play in the
   midst of the market place, it would be most disgraceful and unbecoming
   for us to leave our household business, and join them; for children's
   toys are not becoming for old age:  so, when others are contending,
   even if I am better informed than the majority, I could not allow
   myself to be one of them, rather than, as I now do, enjoy the freedom
   of obscurity.  For, besides all this, my feeling is that I do not, on
   most points, agree with the majority, and cannot bear to walk in the
   same way.  Rash and stupid though it may be, such is my feeling.  That
   which is pleasant to others causes pain to me, and I am pleased with
   what is painful to others.  So that I should not be surprised if I were
   even imprisoned as a disagreeable man, and thought by most men to be
   out of my senses, as is said to have been the case with one of the
   Greek philosophers, whose moderation exposed him to the charge of
   madness, because he laughed at everything, since he saw that the
   objects of the eager pursuit of the majority were ridiculous; or even
   be thought full of new wine as were in later days the disciples of
   Christ, because they spoke with tongues, [4379] since men knew not that
   it was the power of the Spirit, and not a distraction of mind.

   23.  Now, consider the charges laid against us.  You have been ruler of
   the church, it is said, for so long, and favoured by the course of
   time, and the influence of the sovereign, a most important matter.
   What change have we been able to notice?  How many men have in days
   gone by used us outrageously?  What sufferings have we failed to
   undergo?  Ill-usage?  Threats?  Banishment?  Plunder?  Confiscation?
   The burning [4380] of priests at sea?  The desecration of temples by
   the blood of the saints, till, instead of temples, they became
   charnel-houses?  The public slaughter of aged Bishops, to speak more
   accurately, of Patriarchs?  The denial of access to every place in the
   case of the godly alone?  In fact any kind of suffering which could be
   mentioned?  And for which of these have we requited the wrongdoers?
   For the wheel of fortune gave us the power of rightly treating those
   who so treated us, and our persecutors ought to have received a
   lesson.  Apart from all other things, speaking only of our experiences,
   not to mention your own, have we not been persecuted, maltreated,
   driven from churches, houses, and, most terrible of all, even from the
   deserts?  Have we not had to endure an enraged people, insolent
   governors, the disregard of Emperors and their decrees?  What was the
   result?  We became stronger, and our persecutors took to flight.  That
   was actually the case.  The power to requite them seemed to me a
   sufficient vengeance on those who had wronged us.  These men thought
   otherwise; for they are exceedingly exact and just in requiting:  and
   accordingly they demand [4381] what the state of things permits.  What
   governor, they say, has been fined?  What populace chastised?  What
   ringleaders of the populace?  What fear of ourselves have we been able
   to inspire for the future?

   24.  Perhaps [4382] we may be reproached, as we have been before, with
   the exquisite character of our table, the splendour of our apparel, the
   officers who precede us, our haughtiness to those who meet us.  I was
   not aware that we ought to rival the consuls, the governors, the most
   illustrious generals, who have no opportunity of lavishing their
   incomes; or that our belly ought to hunger for the enjoyment of the
   goods of the poor, and to expend their necessaries on superfluities,
   and belch forth over the altars.  I did not know that we ought to ride
   on splendid horses, and drive in magnificent carriages, and be preceded
   by a procession and surrounded by applause, and have everyone make way
   for us, as if we were wild beasts, and open out a passage so that our
   approach might be seen afar.  If these sufferings have been endured,
   they have now passed away:  Forgive me this wrong. [4383]   Elect
   another who will please the majority:  and give me my desert, my
   country life, and my God, Whom alone I may have to please, and shall
   please by my simple life.  It is a painful thing to be deprived of
   speeches and conferences, and public gatherings, and applause like that
   which now lends wings to my thoughts, and relatives, and friends and
   honours, and the beauty and grandeur of the city, and its brilliancy
   which dazzles those who look at the surface without investigating the
   inner nature of things; but yet not so painful as being clamoured
   against and besmirched amid public disturbances and agitations, which
   trim their sails to the popular breeze.  For they seek not for priests,
   but for orators, not for stewards of souls, but for treasurers of
   money, not for pure offerers of the sacrifice, but for powerful
   patrons.  I will say a word in their defence:  we have thus trained
   them, by becoming all things to all men, [4384] whether to save or
   destroy all, I know not.

   25.  What say you?  Are you persuaded, have you been overcome by my
   words?  Or must I use stronger terms in order to persuade you?  Yea by
   the Trinity Itself, Whom you and I alike worship, by our common hope,
   and for the sake of the unity of this people, grant me this favour;
   dismiss me with your prayers; let this be the proclamation of my
   contest; give me my certificate of retirement, as sovereigns do to
   their soldiers; and, if you will, with a favourable testimony, that I
   may enjoy the honour of it; if not, just as you please; this will make
   no difference to me, until God sees what my case really is.  What
   successor then shall we elect?  God will provide Himself [4385] a
   shepherd for the office, as He once provided a lamb for a
   burnt-offering.  I only make this further request,--let him be one who
   is the object of envy, not the object of pity; not one who yields
   everything to all, but one who can on some points offer resistance for
   the sake of what is best:  for though the one is most pleasant, the
   other is most profitable.  So do you prepare for me your addresses of
   dismissal:  I will now bid you farewell.

   26.  Farewell my Anastasia, [4386] whose name is redolent of piety:
   for thou hast raised up for us the doctrine which was in contempt:
   farewell, scene of our common victory, modern Shiloh, [4387] where the
   tabernacle was first fixed, after being carried about in its wanderings
   for forty years in the wilderness.  Farewell likewise, grand and
   renowned temple, our new inheritance, whose greatness is now due to the
   Word, which once wast a Jebus, [4388] and hast now been made by us a
   Jerusalem.  Farewell, all ye others, inferior only to this in beauty,
   scattered through the various parts of the city, like so many links,
   uniting together each your own neighbourhood, which have been filled
   with worshippers of whose existence we had despaired, not by me, in my
   weakness, but by the grace which was with me. [4389]   Farewell, ye
   Apostles, [4390] noble settlers here, my masters in the strife; if I
   have not often kept festival with you, it has been possibly due to the
   Satan [4391] which I, like S. Paul, [4392] who was one of you, carry
   about in my body for my own profit, and which is the cause of my now
   leaving you.  Farewell, my throne, envied and perilous height; farewell
   assembly of high priests, honoured by the dignity and age of its
   priests, and all ye others ministers of God round the holy table,
   drawing nigh to the God Who draws nigh to you. [4393]   Farewell,
   choirs of Nazarites, harmonies of the Psalter, night-long stations,
   venerable virgins, decorous matrons, gatherings of widows and orphans,
   and ye eyes of the poor, turned towards God and towards me.  Farewell,
   hospitable and Christ-loved dwellings, helpers of my infirmity.
   Farewell, ye lovers of my discourses, in your eagerness and concourse,
   ye pencils seen and unseen, and thou balustrade, pressed upon by those
   who thrust themselves forward to hear the word.  Farewell, Emperors,
   and palace, and ministers and household of the Emperor, whether
   faithful or not to him, I know not, but for the most part, unfaithful
   to God.  Clap your hands, shout aloud, extol your orator to the skies.
   This pestilent and garrulous tongue has ceased to speak to you.  Though
   it will not utterly cease to speak:  for it will fight with hand and
   ink:  but for the present we have ceased to speak.

   27.  Farewell, mighty Christ-loving city.  I will testify to the truth,
   though thy zeal be not according to knowledge. [4394]   Our separation
   renders us more kindly.  Approach the truth:  be converted at this late
   hour.  Honour God more than you have been wont to do.  It is no
   disgrace to change, while it is fatal to cling to evil.  Farewell, East
   and West, for whom and against whom I have had to fight; He is witness,
   Who will give you peace, if but a few would imitate my retirement.  For
   those who resign their thrones will not also lose God, but will have
   the seat on high, which is far more exalted and secure.  Last of all,
   and most of all, I will cry,--farewell ye Angels, guardians of this
   church, and of my presence and pilgrimage, since our affairs are in the
   hands of God.  Farewell, O Trinity, my meditation, and my glory.
   Mayest Thou be preserved by those who are here, and preserve them, my
   people:  for they are mine, even if I have my place assigned elsewhere;
   and may I learn that Thou art ever extolled and glorified in word and
   conduct.  My children, keep, I pray you, that which is committed to
   your trust. [4395]   Remember my stonings. [4396]   The grace of our
   Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.

   Oration XLIII.

   Funeral Oration on the Great S. Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia.

   S. Basil died January 1, a.d. 379.  A serious illness, in addition to
   other causes, prevented S. Gregory from being present at his funeral
   (Epist. 79).  Benoît holds that an expression (Epitaph, cxix. 38) in
   which S. Gregory says that his "lips are fettered" proves that he was
   still in retirement at Seleucia.  This is an unwarranted deduction.  In
   this Oration, § 2, the Saint, alluding to his illness in disparaging
   terms, alleges his labours at Constantinople as a more pressing reason
   for his absence:  and says that he undertook the task according to the
   judgment of S. Basil.  This implies that S. Gregory went to
   Constantinople before the death of S. Basil, or that he had then been
   influenced by his friend's advice and was on the point of setting
   out--more probably the former, as we may be sure that, if S. Gregory
   had been still at Seleucia, no reason but physical incapacity would
   have kept him from his friend's side.  His pressing duties at
   Constantinople and the difficulties of the long journey were the "other
   causes" of his letter to S. Gregory of Nyssa:  and we know that he
   suffered from serious illness at Constantinople (Carm. xi. 887.  Orat.
   xxiii. 1).  S. Gregory left Constantinople in June, a.d. 381, and
   Tillemont places the date of this Oration soon after his return to
   Nazianzus.  Benoît thinks that it was probably delivered on the
   anniversary of S. Basil's death.  The Oration, as all critics are
   agreed, is one of great power and beauty.  Its length (62 pages folio),
   the physical weakness of the speaker, and the limits of the endurance
   of even an interested audience, incline us to suppose that it was not
   spoken in its present form.  We cannot well set aside expressions which
   clearly point to actual delivery, but it may have been amplified later.

   1.  It has then been ordained that the great Basil, who used so
   constantly to furnish me with subjects for my discourses, of which he
   was quite as proud as any other man of his own, should himself now
   furnish me with the grandest subject which has ever fallen to the lot
   of an orator.  For I think that if anyone desired, in making trial of
   his powers of eloquence, to test them by the standard of that one of
   all his subjects which he preferred (as painters do with epoch-making
   pictures), he would choose that which stood first of all others, but
   would set aside this as beyond the powers of human eloquence.  So great
   a task is the praise of such a man, not only to me, who have long ago
   laid aside all thought of emulation, but even to those who live for
   eloquence, and whose sole object is the gaining of glory by subjects
   like this.  Such is my opinion, and, as I persuade myself, with perfect
   justice.  But I know not what subject I can treat with eloquence, if
   not this; or what greater favour I can do to myself, to the admirers of
   virtue, or to eloquence itself, than express our admiration for this
   man.  To me it is the discharge of a most sacred debt.  And our speech
   is a debt beyond all others due to those who have been gifted, in
   particular, with powers of speech.  To the admirers of virtue a
   discourse is at once a pleasure and an incentive to virtue.  For when
   [4397] I have learned the praises of men, I have a distinct idea of
   their progress:  now, there is none of us all, within whose power it is
   not to attain to any point whatsoever in that progress.  As for
   eloquence itself, in either case, all must go well with it.  For, if
   the discourse be almost worthy of its subject--eloquence will have
   given an exhibition of its power:  if it fall far short of it, as must
   be the case when the praises of Basil are being set forth, by an actual
   demonstration of its incapacity, it will have declared the superiority
   of the excellences of its subject to all expression in words.

   2.  These are the reasons which have urged me to speak, and to address
   myself to this contest.  And at my late appearance, long after his
   praises have been set forth by so many, who have publicly and privately
   done him honour, let no one be surprised.  Yea, may I be pardoned by
   that divine soul, the object of my constant reverence!  And as, when he
   was amongst us, he constantly corrected me in many points, according to
   the rights of a friend and the still higher law; for I am not ashamed
   to say this, for he was a standard of virtue to us all; so now, looking
   down upon me from above, he will treat me with indulgence.  I ask
   pardon too of any here who are among his warmest admirers, if indeed
   anyone can be warmer than another, and we are not all abreast in our
   zeal for his good fame.  For it is not contempt which has caused me to
   fall short of what might have been expected of me:  nor have I been so
   regardless of the claims of virtue or of friendship; nor have I thought
   that to praise him befitted any other more than me.  No! my first
   reason was, that I shrunk from this task, for I will say the truth, as
   priests [4398] do, who approach their sacred duties before being
   cleansed both in voice and mind.  In the second place, I remind you,
   though you know it well, of the task [4399] in which I was engaged on
   behalf of the true doctrine, which had been properly forced upon me,
   and had carried me from home, according, as I suppose, to the will of
   God, and certainly according to the judgment of our noble champion of
   the truth, the breath of whose life was pious doctrine alone, such as
   promotes the salvation of the whole world.  As for my bodily health, I
   ought not, perhaps, to dare to mention it, when my subject is a man so
   doughty in his conquest of the body, even before his removal hence, and
   who maintained that no powers of the soul should suffer hindrance from
   this our fetter. [4400]   So much for my defence.  I do not think I
   need labour it further, in speaking of him to you who know so clearly
   my affairs.  I must now proceed with my eulogy, commending myself to
   his God, in order that my commendations may not prove an insult to the
   man, and that I may not lag far behind all others; even though we all
   equally fall as far short of his due, as those who look upon the
   heavens or the rays of the Sun.

   3.  Had I seen him to be proud of his birth, and the rights of birth,
   or any of those infinitely little objects of those whose eyes are on
   the ground, we should have had to inspect a new catalogue of the
   Heroes.  What details as to his ancestors might I not have laid under
   contribution!  Nor would even history have had any advantage over me,
   since I claim this advantage, that his celebrity depends, not upon
   fiction or legend, but upon actual facts attested by many witnesses.
   On his father's side Pontus offers to me many details, in no wise
   inferior to its wonders of old time, of which all history and poesy are
   full; [4401] there are many others concerned with this my native land,
   of illustrious men of Cappadocia, renowned for its youthful progeny,
   [4402] no less than for its horses.  Accordingly we match with his
   father's family that of his mother.  What family owns more numerous, or
   more illustrious generals and governors, or court officials, or again,
   men of wealth, and lofty thrones, and public honours, and oratorical
   renown?  If it were permitted me to wish to mention them, I would make
   nothing of the Pelopidæ and Cecropidæ, the Alcmæonids, the Æacidæ, and
   Heracleidæ, and other most noble families:  inasmuch as they, in
   default of public merit in their house, betake themselves to the region
   of uncertainty, claiming demigods and divinities, merely mythical
   personages, as the glory of their ancestors, whose most vaunted details
   are incredible, and those which we can believe are an infamy.

   4.  But since our subject is a man who has maintained that each man's
   nobility is to be judged of according to his own worth, and that, as
   forms and colours, and likewise our most celebrated and most infamous
   horses, are tested by their own properties, so we too ought not to be
   depicted in borrowed plumes; after mentioning one or two traits, which,
   though inherited from his ancestors, he made his own by his life, and
   which are specially likely to give pleasure to my hearers, I will then
   proceed to deal with the man himself.  Different families and
   individuals have different points of distinction and interest, great or
   small, which, like a patrimony of longer or shorter descent, come down
   to posterity:  the distinction of his family on either side was piety,
   which I now proceed to display.

   5.  There was a persecution, the most frightful and severe of all; I
   mean, as you know, the persecution of Maximinus, which, following
   closely upon those which immediately preceded it, made them all seem
   gentle, by its excessive audacity, and by its eagerness to win the
   crown of violence in impiety.  It was overcome by many of our
   champions, who wrestled with it to the death, or well-nigh to the
   death, with only life enough left in them to survive their victory, and
   not pass away in the midst of the struggle; remaining to be trainers
   [4403] in virtue, living witnesses, breathing trophies, silent
   exhortations, among whose numerous ranks were found Basil's paternal
   ancestors, upon whom, in their practice of every form of piety, that
   period bestowed many a fair garland.  So prepared and determined were
   they to bear readily all those things on account of which Christ crowns
   those who have imitated His struggle on our behalf.

   6.  But since their strife must needs be lawful, and the law of
   martyrdom alike forbids us voluntarily to go to meet it (in
   consideration for the persecutors, and for the weak) or to shrink from
   it if it comes upon us; for the former shows foolhardiness, the latter
   cowardice; in this respect they paid due honour to the Lawgiver; but
   what was their device, or rather, to what were they led by the
   Providence which guided them in all things?  They betook themselves to
   a thicket on the mountains of Pontus, of which there are many deep ones
   of considerable extent, with very few comrades of their flight, or
   attendants upon their needs.  Let others marvel at the length of time,
   for their flight was exceedingly prolonged, to about seven years, or a
   little more, and their mode of life, delicately nurtured as they were,
   was straitened and unusual, as may be imagined, with the discomfort of
   its exposure to frost and heat and rain:  and the wilderness allowed no
   fellowship or converse with friends:  a great trial to men accustomed
   to the attendance and honour of a numerous retinue.  But I will proceed
   to speak of what is still greater and more extraordinary:  nor will
   anyone fail to credit it, save those who, in their feeble and dangerous
   judgment, think little of persecutions and dangers for Christ's sake.

   7.  These noble men, suffering from the lapse of time, and feeling a
   distaste for ordinary food, felt a longing for something more
   appetising.  They did not indeed speak as Israel did, [4404] for they
   were not murmurers [4405] like them, in their afflictions in the
   desert, after the escape from Egypt--that Egypt would have been better
   for them than the wilderness, in the bountiful supply of its
   flesh-pots, and other dainties which they had left behind them there,
   for the brickmaking and the clay seemed nothing to them then in their
   folly--but in a more pious and faithful manner.  For why, said they, is
   it incredible that the God of wonders, who bountifully fed [4406] in
   the wilderness his homeless and fugitive people, raining bread upon
   them, and abounding in quails, nourishing them not only with
   necessaries, but even with luxuries:  that He, Who divided the sea,
   [4407] and stayed the sun, [4408] and parted the river, with all the
   other things that He has done; for under such circumstances the mind is
   wont to recur to history, and sing the praises of God's many wonders:
   that He, they went on, should feed us champions of piety with dainties
   to-day?  Many animals which have escaped the tables of the rich, have
   their lairs in these mountains, and many eatable birds fly over our
   longing heads, any of which can surely be caught at the mere fiat of
   Thy will!  At these words, their quarry lay before them, with food come
   of its own accord, a complete banquet prepared without effort, stags
   appearing all at once from some place in the hills.  How splendid they
   were! how fat! how ready for the slaughter!  It might almost be
   imagined that they were annoyed at not having been summoned earlier.
   Some of them made signs to draw others after them, the rest followed
   their lead.  Who pursued and drove them?  No one.  What riders?  What
   kind of dogs, what barking, or cry, or young men who had occupied the
   exits according to the rules of the chase?  They were the prisoners of
   prayer and righteous petition.  Who has known such a hunt among men of
   this, or any day?

   8.  O what a wonder!  They were themselves stewards of the chase; what
   they would, was caught by the mere will to do so; what was left, they
   sent away to the thickets, for another meal.  The cooks were
   extemporised, the dinner exquisite, the guests were grateful for this
   wonderful foretaste of their hopes.  And hence they grew more earnest
   in their struggle, in return for which they had received this
   blessing.  Such is my history.  And do thou, my persecutor, in thy
   admiration for legends, tell of thy huntresses, [4409] and Orions, and
   Actæons, those ill-fated hunters, and the hind substituted for the
   maiden, [4410] if any such thing rouses thee to emulation, and if we
   grant that this story is no legend.  The sequel of the tale is too
   disgraceful.  For what is the benefit of the exchange, if a maiden is
   saved to be taught to murder her guests, and learn to requite humanity
   with inhumanity?  Let this one instance, such as it is, chosen out of
   many, represent the rest, as far as I am concerned.  I have not related
   it to contribute to his reputation:  for neither does the sea stand in
   need of the rivers which flow into it, many and great though they be,
   nor does the present subject of my praises need any contributions to
   his fair fame.  No! my object is to exhibit the character of his
   ancestors, and the example before his eyes, which he so far excelled.
   For if other men find it a great additional advantage to receive
   somewhat of their honour from their forefathers, it is a greater thing
   for him to have made such an addition to the original stock that the
   stream seems to have run uphill.

   9.  The union of his parents, cemented as it was by a community of
   virtue, no less than by cohabitation, was notable for many reasons,
   especially for generosity to the poor, for hospitality, for purity of
   soul as the result of self-discipline, for the dedication to God of a
   portion of their property, a matter not as yet so much cared for by
   most men, as it now has grown to be, in consequence of such previous
   examples, as have given distinction to it, and for all those other
   points, which have been published throughout Pontus and Cappadocia, to
   the satisfaction of many:  in my opinion, however, their greatest claim
   to distinction is the excellence of their children.  Legend indeed has
   its instances of men whose children were many and beautiful, but it is
   practical experience which has presented to us these parents, whose own
   character, apart from that of their children, was sufficient for their
   fair fame, while the character of their children would have made them,
   even without their own eminence in virtue, to surpass all men by the
   excellence of their children.  For the attainment of distinction by one
   or two of their offspring might be ascribed to their nature; but when
   all are eminent, the honour is clearly due to those who brought them
   up.  This is proved by the blessed roll of priests and virgins, and of
   those who, when married, have allowed nothing in their union to hinder
   them from attaining an equal repute, and so have made the distinction
   between them to consist in the condition, rather than in the mode of
   their life.

   10.  Who has not known Basil, our archbishop's father, a great name to
   everyone, who attained a father's prayer, if anyone, I will not say as
   no one, ever did?  For he surpassed all in virtue, and was only
   prevented by his son from gaining the first prize.  Who has not known
   Emmelia, whose name was a forecast of what she became, or else whose
   life was an exemplification of her name?  For she had a right to the
   name which implies gracefulness, and occupied, to speak concisely, the
   same place among women, as her husband among men.  So that, when it was
   decided that he, in whose honour we are met, should be given to men to
   submit to the bondage of nature, as anyone of old has been given by God
   for the common advantage, it was neither fitting that he should be born
   of other parents, nor that they should possess another son:  and so the
   two things suitably concurred.  I have now, in obedience to the Divine
   law which bids us to pay all honour to parents, bestowed the
   firstfruits of my praises upon those whom I have commemorated, and
   proceed to treat of Basil himself, premising this, which I think will
   seem true to all who knew him, that we only need his own voice to
   pronounce his eulogium.  For he is at once a brilliant subject for
   praise, and the only one whose powers of speech make him worthy of
   treating it.  Beauty indeed and strength and size, in which I see that
   most men rejoice, I concede to anyone who will--not that even in these
   points he was inferior to any of those men of small minds who busy
   themselves about the body, while he was still young, and had not yet
   reduced the flesh by austerity--but that I may avoid the fate of
   unskilful athletes, who waste their strength in vain efforts after
   minor objects, and so are worsted in the crucial struggle, whose
   results are victory and the distinction of the crown.  The praise,
   then, which I shall claim for him is based upon grounds which no one, I
   think, will consider superfluous, or beyond the scope of my oration.

   11.  I take it as admitted by men of sense, that the first of our
   advantages is education; and not only this our more noble form of it,
   which disregards rhetorical ornaments and glory, and holds to
   salvation, and beauty in the objects of our contemplation:  but even
   that external culture which many Christians ill-judgingly abhor, as
   treacherous and dangerous, and keeping us afar from God.  For as we
   ought not to neglect the heavens, and earth, and air, and all such
   things, because some have wrongly seized upon them, and honour God's
   works instead of God:  but to reap what advantage we can from them for
   our life and enjoyment, while we avoid their dangers; not raising
   creation, as foolish men do, in revolt against the Creator, but from
   the works of nature apprehending the Worker, [4411] and, as the divine
   apostle says, bringing into captivity every thought to Christ: [4412]
   and again, as we know that neither fire, nor food, nor iron, nor any
   other of the elements, is of itself most useful, or most harmful,
   except according to the will of those who use it; and as we have
   compounded healthful drugs from certain of the reptiles; so from
   secular literature we have received principles of enquiry and
   speculation, while we have rejected their idolatry, terror, and pit of
   destruction.  Nay, even these have aided us in our religion, by our
   perception of the contrast between what is worse and what is better,
   and by gaining strength for our doctrine from the weakness of theirs.
   We must not then dishonour education, because some men are pleased to
   do so, but rather suppose such men to be boorish and uneducated,
   desiring all men to be as they themselves are, in order to hide
   themselves in the general, and escape the detection of their want of
   culture.  But come now, and, after this sketch of our subject and these
   admissions, let us contemplate the life of Basil.

   12.  In his earliest years he was swathed and fashioned, in that best
   and purest fashioning which the Divine David speaks of as proceeding
   day by day, [4413] in contrast with that of the night, under his great
   father, acknowledged in those days by Pontus, as its common teacher of
   virtue.  Under him then, as life and reason grew and rose together, our
   illustrious friend was educated:  not boasting of a Thessalian mountain
   cave, as the workshop of his virtue, nor of some braggart Centaur,
   [4414] the tutor of the heroes of his day:  nor was he taught under
   such tuition to shoot hares, and run down fawns, or hunt stags, or
   excel in war, or in breaking colts, using the same person as teacher
   and horse at once; nor nourished on the fabulous marrows of stags and
   lions, but he was trained in general education, and practised in the
   worship of God, and, to speak concisely, led on by elementary
   instructions to his future perfection.  For those who are successful in
   life or in letters only, while deficient in the other, seem to me to
   differ in nothing from one-eyed men, whose loss is great, but their
   deformity greater, both in their own eyes, and in those of others.
   While those who attain eminence in both alike, and are ambidextrous,
   both possess perfection, and pass their life with the blessedness of
   heaven.  This is what befell him, who had at home a model of virtue in
   well-doing, the very sight of which made him excellent from the first.
   As we see foals and calves skipping beside their mothers from their
   birth, so he too, running close beside his father in foal-like
   wantonness, without being left far behind in his lofty impulses toward
   virtue, or, if you will, sketching out and showing traces of the future
   beauty of his virtue, and drawing the outlines of perfection before the
   time of perfection arrived.

   13.  When sufficiently trained at home, as he ought to fall short in no
   form of excellence, and not be surpassed by the busy bee, which gathers
   what is most useful from every flower, he set out for the city of
   Cæsarea, [4415] to take his place in the schools there, I mean this
   illustrious city of ours, for it was the guide and mistress of my
   studies, the metropolis of letters, no less than of the cities which
   she excels and reigns over:  and if any one were to deprive her of her
   literary power, he would rob her of her fairest and special
   distinction.  Other cities take pride in other ornaments, of ancient or
   of recent date, that they may have something to be described or to be
   seen.  Letters form our distinction here, and are our badge, as if upon
   the field of arms or on the stage.  His subsequent life let those
   detail who trained him, or enjoyed his training, as to what he was to
   his masters, what he was to his classmates, equalling the former,
   surpassing the latter in every form of culture, what renown he won in a
   short time from all, both of the common people, and of the leaders of
   the state; by showing both a culture beyond his years, and a
   steadfastness of character beyond his culture.  An orator among
   orators, even before the chair of the rhetoricians, [4416] a
   philosopher among philosophers, even before the doctrines of
   philosophers:  highest of all a priest among Christians even before the
   priesthood.  So much deference was paid to him in every respect by
   all.  Eloquence was his by-work, from which he culled enough to make it
   an assistance to him in Christian philosophy, since power of this kind
   is needed to set forth the objects of our contemplation.  For a mind
   which cannot express itself is like the motion of a man in a lethargy.
   His pursuit was philosophy, and breaking from the world, and fellowship
   with God, by concerning himself, amid things below, with things above,
   and winning, where all is unstable and fluctuating, the things which
   are stable and remain.

   14.  Thence to Byzantium, the imperial city of the East, for it was
   distinguished by the eminence of its rhetorical and philosophic
   teachers, whose most valuable lessons he soon assimilated by the
   quickness and force of his powers:  thence he was sent by God, and by
   his generous craving for culture, to Athens the home of letters.
   Athens, which has been to me, if to any one, a city truly of gold, and
   the patroness of all that is good.  For it brought me to know Basil
   more perfectly, though he had not been unknown to me before; and in my
   pursuit of letters, I attained to happiness; and in another fashion had
   the same experience as Saul, [4417] who, seeking his father's asses,
   found a kingdom, and gained incidentally what was of more importance
   than the object which he had in view.  Hitherto my course has been
   clear, leading me in my encomiums along a level and easy, in fact, a
   king's highway:  henceforth I know not how to speak or whither to
   turn:  for my task is becoming arduous.  For here I am anxious, and
   seize this opportunity to add from my own experience somewhat to my
   speech, and to dwell a little upon the recital of the causes and
   circumstances which originated our friendship, or to speak more
   strictly, our unity of life and nature.  For as our eyes are not ready
   to turn from attractive objects, and, if we violently tear them away,
   are wont to return to them again; so do we linger in our description of
   what is most sweet to us.  I am afraid of the difficulty of the
   undertaking.  I will try, however, to use all possible moderation.  And
   if I am at all overpowered by my regret, pardon this most righteous of
   all feelings, the absence of which would be a great loss, in the eyes
   of men of feeling.

   15.  We were contained by Athens, like two branches of some
   river-stream, for after leaving the common fountain of our fatherland,
   we had been separated in our varying pursuit of culture, and were now
   again united by the impulsion of God no less than by our own
   agreement.  I preceded him by a little, but he soon followed me, to be
   welcomed with great and brilliant hope.  For he was versed in many
   languages, before his arrival, and it was a great thing for either of
   us to outstrip the other in the attainment of some object of our
   study.  And I may well add, as a seasoning to any speech, a short
   narrative, which will be a reminder to those who know it, a source of
   information to those who do not.  Most of the young men at Athens in
   their folly are mad after rhetorical skill--not only those who are
   ignobly born and unknown, but even the noble and illustrious, in the
   general mass of young men difficult to keep under control.  They are
   just like men devoted to horses and exhibitions, as we see, at the
   horse-races; they leap, [4418] they shout, raise clouds of dust, they
   drive in their seats, they beat the air, (instead of the horses) with
   their fingers as whips, they yoke and unyoke the horses, though they
   are none of theirs:  they readily exchange with one another drivers,
   horses, positions, leaders:  and who are they who do this?  Often poor
   and needy fellows, without the means of support for a single day.  This
   is just how the students feel in regard to their own tutors, and their
   rivals, in their eagerness to increase their own numbers and thereby
   enrich them.  The matter is absolutely absurd and silly.  Cities,
   roads, harbours, mountain tops, coastlines, are seized upon--in short,
   every part of Attica, or of the rest of Greece, with most of the
   inhabitants; for even these they have divided between the rival
   parties.

   16.  Whenever any newcomer arrives, and falls into the hands of those
   who seize upon him, either by force or willingly, they observe this
   Attic law, of combined jest and earnest.  He is first conducted to the
   house of one of those who were the first to receive him, or of his
   friends, or kinsmen, or countrymen, or of those who are eminent in
   debating power, and purveyors of arguments, and therefore especially
   honoured among them; and their reward consists in the gain of
   adherents.  He is next subjected to the raillery of any one who will,
   with the intention I suppose, of checking the conceit of the newcomers,
   and reducing them to subjection at once.  The raillery is of a more
   insolent or argumentative kind, according to the boorishness or
   refinement of the railer:  and the performance, which seems very
   fearful and brutal to those who do not know it, is to those who have
   experienced it very pleasant and humane:  for its threats are feigned
   rather than real.  Next, he is conducted in procession through the
   market place to the bath.  The procession is formed by those who are
   charged with it in the young man's honour, who arrange themselves in
   two ranks separated by an interval, and precede him to the bath.  But
   when they have approached it, they shout and leap wildly, as if
   possessed, shouting that they must not advance, but stay, since the
   bath will not admit them; and at the same time frighten the youth by
   furiously knocking at the doors:  then allowing him to enter, they now
   present him with his freedom, and receive him after the bath as an
   equal, and one of themselves.  This they consider the most pleasant
   part of the ceremony, as being a speedy exchange and relief from
   annoyances.  On this occasion I not only refused to put to shame my
   friend the great Basil, out of respect for the gravity of his
   character, and the ripeness of his reasoning powers, but also persuaded
   all the rest of the students to treat him likewise, who happened not to
   know him.  For he was from the first respected by most of them, his
   reputation having preceded him.  The result was that he was the only
   one to escape the general rule, and be accorded a greater honour than
   belongs to a freshman's position.

   17.  This was the prelude of our friendship.  This was the kindling
   spark of our union:  thus we felt the wound of mutual love.  Then
   something of this kind happened, for I think it right not to omit even
   this.  I find the Armenians to be not a simple race, but very crafty
   and cunning.  At this time some of his special comrades and friends,
   who had been intimate with him even in the early days of his father's
   instruction, for they were members of his school, came up to him under
   the guise of friendship, but with envious, and not kindly intent, and
   put to him questions of a disputations rather than rational kind,
   trying to overwhelm him at the first onset, having known his original
   natural endowments, and unable to brook the honour he had then
   received.  For they thought it a strange thing that they who had put on
   their gowns, and been exercised in shouting, should not get the better
   of one who was a stranger and a novice.  I also, in my vain love for
   Athens, and trusting to their professions without perceiving their
   envy, when they were giving way, and turning their backs, since I was
   indignant that in their persons the reputation of Athens should be
   destroyed, and so speedily put to shame, supported the young men, and
   restored the argument; and by the aid of my additional weight, for in
   such cases a small addition makes all the difference, and, as the poet
   says, "made equal their heads in the fray." [4419]   But, when I
   perceived the secret motive of the dispute, which could no longer be
   kept under, and was at last clearly exposed, I at once drew back, and
   retired from their ranks, to range myself on his side, and made the
   victory decisive.  He was at once delighted at what had happened, for
   his sagacity was remarkable, and being filled with zeal, to describe
   him fully in Homer's language, he pursued in confusion [4420] with
   argument those valiant youths, and, smiting them with syllogisms, only
   ceased when they were utterly routed, and he had distinctly won the
   honours due to his power.  Thus was kindled again, no longer a spark,
   but a manifest and conspicuous blaze of friendship.

   18.  Their efforts having thus proved fruitless, while they severely
   blamed their own rashness, they cherished such annoyance against me
   that it broke out into open hostility, and a charge of treachery, not
   only to them, but to Athens herself:  inasmuch as they had been
   confuted and put to shame at the first onset, by a single student, who
   had not even had time to gain confidence.  He moreover, according to
   that human feeling, which makes us, when we have all at once attained
   to the high hopes which we have cherished, look upon their results as
   inferior to our expectation, he, I say, was displeased and annoyed, and
   could take no delight in his arrival.  He was seeking for what he had
   expected, and called Athens an empty happiness.  I however tried to
   remove his annoyance, both by argumentative encounter, and by the
   enchantments of reasoning; alleging, as is true, that the disposition
   of a man cannot at once be detected, without a long time and more
   constant association, and that culture likewise is not made known to
   those who make trial of her, after a few efforts and in a short time.
   In this way I restored his cheerfulness, and by this mutual experience,
   he was the more closely united to me.

   19.  And when, as time went on, we acknowledged our mutual affection,
   and that philosophy [4421] was our aim, we were all in all to one
   another, housemates, messmates, intimates, with one object in life, or
   an affection for each other ever growing warmer and stronger.  Love for
   bodily attractions, since its objects are fleeting, is as fleeting as
   the flowers of spring.  For the flame cannot survive, when the fuel is
   exhausted, and departs along with that which kindles it, nor does
   desire abide, when its incentive wastes away.  But love which is godly
   and under restraint, since its object is stable, not only is more
   lasting, but, the fuller its vision of beauty grows, the more closely
   does it bind to itself and to one another the hearts of those whose
   love has one and the same object.  This is the law of our superhuman
   love.  I feel that I am being unduly borne away, and I know not how to
   enter upon this point, yet I cannot restrain myself from describing
   it.  For if I have omitted anything, it seems, immediately afterwards,
   of pressing importance, and of more consequence than what I had
   preferred to mention.  And if any one would carry me tyrannically
   forward, I become like the polyps, which when they are being dragged
   from their holes, cling with their suckers to the rocks, and cannot be
   detached, until the last of these has had exerted upon it its necessary
   share of force.  If then you give me leave, I have my request, if not I
   must take it from myself.

   20.  Such were our feelings for each other, when we had thus supported,
   as Pindar [4422] has it, our "well-built chamber with pillars of gold,"
   as we advanced under the united influences of God's grace and our own
   affection.  Oh! how can I mention these things without tears.

   We were impelled by equal hopes, in a pursuit especially obnoxious to
   envy, that of letters.  Yet envy we knew not, and emulation was of
   service to us.  We struggled, not each to gain the first place for
   himself, but to yield it to the other; for we made each other's
   reputation to be our own.  We seemed to have one soul, inhabiting two
   bodies.  And if we must not believe those whose doctrine is "All things
   [4423] are in all;" yet in our case it was worthy of belief, so did we
   live in and with each other.  The sole business of both of us was
   virtue, and living for the hopes to come, having retired from this
   world, before our actual departure hence.  With a view to this, were
   directed all our life and actions, under the guidance of the
   commandment, as we sharpened upon each other our weapons of virtue; and
   if this is not a great thing for me to say, being a rule and standard
   to each other, for the distinction between what was right and what was
   not.  Our associates were not the most dissolute, but the most sober of
   our comrades; not the most pugnacious, but the most peaceable, whose
   intimacy was most profitable:  knowing that it is more easy to be
   tainted with vice, than to impart virtue; just as we can more readily
   be infected with a disease, than bestow health.  Our most cherished
   studies were not the most pleasant, but the most excellent; this being
   one means of forming young minds in a virtuous or vicious mould.

   21.  Two ways were known to us, the first of greater value, the second
   of smaller consequence:  the one leading to our sacred buildings and
   the teachers there, the other to secular instructors.  All others we
   left to those who would pursue them--to feasts, theatres, meetings,
   banquets.  For nothing is in my opinion of value, save that which leads
   to virtue and to the improvement of its devotees.  Different men have
   different names, derived from their fathers, their families, their
   pursuits, their exploits:  we had but one great business and name--to
   be and to be called Christians of which we thought more than Gyges
   [4424] of the turning of his ring, if this is not a legend, on which
   depended his Lydian sovereignty:  or than Midas [4425] did of the gold
   through which he perished, in answer to his prayer that all he had
   might turn to gold--another Phrygian legend.  For why should I speak of
   the arrow of the Hyperborean Abaris, [4426] or of the Argive Pegasus,
   [4427] to whom flight through the air was not of such consequence as
   was to us our rising to God, through the help of, and with each other?
   Hurtful as Athens was to others in spiritual things, and this is of no
   slight consequence to the pious, for the city is richer in those evil
   riches--idols--than the rest of Greece, and it is hard to avoid being
   carried along with their devotees and adherents, yet we, our minds
   being closed up and fortified against this, suffered no injury.  On the
   contrary, strange as it may seem, we were thus the more confirmed in
   the faith, from our perception of their trickery and unreality, which
   led us to despise these divinities in the very home of their worship.
   And if there is, or is believed to be, a river [4428] flowing with
   fresh water through the sea, or an animal [4429] which can dance in
   fire, the consumer of all things, such were we among all our comrades.

   22.  And, best of all, we were surrounded by a far from ignoble band,
   under his instruction and guidance, and delighting in the same objects,
   as we ran on foot beside that Lydian car, [4430] his own course and
   disposition:  and so we became famous, not only among our own teachers
   and comrades, but even throughout Greece, and especially in the eyes of
   its most distinguished men.  We even passed beyond its boundaries, as
   was made clear by the evidence of many.  For our instructors were known
   to all who knew Athens, and all who knew them, knew us, as the subject
   of conversation, being actually looked upon, or heard of by report, as
   an illustrious pair.  Orestes and Pylades [4431] were in their eyes
   nothing to us, or the sons of Molione, [4432] the wonders of the
   Homeric scroll, celebrated for their union in misfortune, and their
   splendid driving, as they shared in reins and whip alike.  But I have
   been unawares betrayed into praising myself, in a manner I would not
   have allowed in another.  And it is no wonder that I gained here in
   some advantage from his friendship, and that, as in life he aided me in
   virtue, so since his departure he has contributed to my renown.  But I
   must return to my proper course.

   23.  Who possessed such a degree of the prudence of old age, even
   before his hair was gray?  Since it is by this that Solomon defines old
   age. [4433]   Who was so respectful to both old and young, not only of
   our contemporaries, but even of those who long preceded him?  Who,
   owing to his character, was less in need of education?  Yet who, even
   with his character, was so imbued with learning?  What branch of
   learning did he not traverse; and that with unexampled success, passing
   through all, as no one else passed through any one of them:  and
   attaining such eminence in each, as if it had been his sole study?  The
   two great sources of power in the arts and sciences, ability and
   application, were in him equally combined.  For, because of the pains
   he took, he had but little need of natural quickness, and his natural
   quickness made it unnecessary for him to take pains; and such was the
   cooperation and unity of both, that it was hard to see for which of the
   two he was more remarkable.  Who had such power in Rhetoric, which
   breathes [4434] with the might of fire, different as his disposition
   was from that of rhetoricians?  Who in Grammar, which perfects our
   tongues in Greek and compiles history, and presides over metres and
   legislates for poems?  Who in Philosophy, that really lofty and high
   reaching science, whether practical and speculative, or in that part of
   it whose oppositions and struggles are concerned with logical
   demonstrations; which is called Dialectic, and in which it was more
   difficult to elude his verbal toils, if need required, than to escape
   from the Labyrinths? [4435]   Of Astronomy, Geometry, and numerical
   proportion he had such a grasp, that he could not be baffled by those
   who are clever in such sciences:  excessive application to them he
   despised, as useless to those whose desire is godliness:  so that it is
   possible to admire what he chose more than what he neglected, or what
   he neglected more than what he chose.  Medicine, the result of
   philosophy and laboriousness, was rendered necessary for him by his
   physical delicacy, and his care of the sick.  From these beginnings he
   attained to a mastery of the art, not only in its empirical and
   practical branches, but also in its theory and principles.  But what
   are these, illustrious though they be, compared with the moral
   discipline of the man?  To those who have had experience of him, Minos
   and Rhadamanthus [4436] were mere trifles, whom the Greeks thought
   worthy of the meadows of Asphodel and the Elysian plains, which are
   their representations of our Paradise, derived from those books of
   Moses which are also ours, for though their terms are different, this
   is what they refer to under other names.

   24.  Such was the case, and his galleon was laden with all the learning
   attainable by the nature of man; for beyond Cadiz [4437] there is no
   passage.  There was left no other need but that of rising to a more
   perfect life, and grasping those hopes upon which we were agreed.  The
   day of our departure was at hand, with its attendant speeches of
   farewell, and of escort, its invitations to return, its lamentations,
   embraces and tears.  For there is nothing so painful to any one, as is
   separation from Athens and one another, to those who have been comrades
   there.  On that occasion was seen a piteous spectacle, worthy of
   record.  Around us were grouped our fellow students and classmates and
   some of our teachers, protesting amid entreaties, violence, and
   persuasion, that, whatever happened, they would not let us go; saying
   and doing everything that men in distress could do.  And here I will
   bring an accusation against myself, and also, daring though it be,
   against that divine and irreproachable soul.  For he, by detailing the
   reasons of his anxiety to return home, was able to prevail over their
   desire to retain him, and they were compelled, though with reluctance,
   to agree to his departure.  But I was left behind at Athens, partly, to
   say the truth, because I had been prevailed on--partly because he had
   betrayed me, having been persuaded to forsake and hand over to his
   captors one who refused to forsake him.  A thing incredible, before it
   happened.  For it was like cutting one body into two, to the
   destruction of either part, or the severance of two bullocks who have
   shared the same manger and the same yoke, amid pitiable bellowings
   after one another in protest against the separation.  However, my loss
   was not of long duration, for I could not long bear to be seen in
   piteous plight, nor to have to account to every one for our
   separation:  so, after a brief stay at Athens, my longing desire made
   me, like the horse in Homer, to burst the bonds of those who restrained
   me, and prancing o'er the plains, rush to my mate.

   25.  Upon our return, after a slight indulgence to the world and the
   stage, sufficient to gratify the general desire, not from any
   inclination to theatrical display, we soon became independent, and,
   after being promoted from the rank of beardless boys to that of men,
   made bold advances along the road of philosophy, for though no longer
   together, since envy would not allow this, we were united by our eager
   desire.  The city of Cæsarea took possession of him, as a second
   founder and patron, but in course of time he was occasionally absent,
   as a matter of necessity due to our separation, and with a view to our
   determined course of philosophy.  Dutiful attendance on my aged
   parents, and a succession of misfortunes kept me apart from him,
   perhaps without right or justice, but so it was.  And to this cause I
   am inclined to ascribe all the inconsistency and difficulty which have
   befallen my life, and the hindrances in the way of philosophy, which
   have been unworthy of my desire and purpose.  But as for my fate, let
   it lead whither God pleases, only may its course be the better for his
   intercessions.  As regards himself, the manifold love of God toward
   man, [4438] and His providential care for our race did, after shewing
   forth his merits under many intervening circumstances with ever greater
   brilliancy, set him up as a conspicuous and celebrated light for the
   Church, by advancing him to the holy thrones of the priesthood, to
   blaze forth, through the single city of Cæsarea, to the whole world.
   And in what manner?  Not by precipitate advancement, nor by at once
   cleansing and making him wise, as is the wont of many present
   candidates for preferment:  but bestowing upon him the honour in the
   due order of spiritual advancement.

   26.  For I do not praise the disorder and irregularity which sometimes
   exist among us, even in those who preside over the sanctuary.  I do not
   venture, nor is it just, to accuse them all.  I approve the nautical
   custom, which first gives the oar to the future steersman, and
   afterward leads him to the stern, and entrusts him with the command,
   and seats him at the helm, only after a long course of striking the sea
   and observing the winds.  As is the case again in military affairs:
   private, captain, general.  This order is the best and most
   advantageous for their subordinates.  And if it were so in our case, it
   would be of great service.  But, as it is, there is a danger of the
   holiest of all offices being the most ridiculous among us.  For
   promotion depends not upon virtue, but upon villany; and the sacred
   thrones fall not to the most Worthy, but to the most powerful.  Samuel,
   the seer into futurity, is among the prophets:  but Saul, the rejected
   one, is also there.  Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, is among the kings,
   but so also is Jeroboam, the slave and apostate.  And there is not a
   physician, or a painter who has not first studied the nature of
   diseases, or mixed many colours, or practised drawing:  but a prelate
   is easily found, without laborious training, with a reputation of
   recent date, being sown and springing up in a moment, as the legend
   [4439] of the giants goes.  We manufacture those who are holy in a day,
   and bid those to be wise, who have had no instruction, and have
   contributed nothing before to their dignity, except the will.  So one
   man is content with an inferior position, and abides in his low estate,
   who is worthy of a lofty one, and has meditated much on the inspired
   words, and has reduced the flesh by many laws into subjection to the
   spirit:  while the other haughtily takes precedence, and raises his
   eyebrow over his betters, and does not tremble at his position, nor is
   he appalled at the sight, seeing the disciplined man beneath him; and
   wrongly supposes himself to be his superior in wisdom as well as in
   rank, having lost his senses under the influence of his position.

   27.  Not so our great and illustrious Basil.  In this grace, as in all
   others, he was a public example.  For he first read to the people the
   sacred books, while already able to expound them, nor did he deem
   himself worthy of this rank [4440] in the sanctuary, and thus proceeded
   to praise the Lord in the seat of the Presbyters, [4441] and next in
   that of the Bishops, attaining the office neither by stealth nor by
   violence, instead of seeking for the honour, being sought for by it,
   and receiving it not as a human favour, but as from God and divine.
   The account of his bishopric must be deferred:  over his subordinate
   ministry let us linger a while, for indeed it had almost escaped me, in
   the midst of my discourse.

   28.  There arose a disagreement between him and his predecessor [4442]
   in the rule over this Church:  its source and character it is best to
   pass over in silence, yet it arose.  He was a man in other respects far
   from ignoble, and admirable for his piety, as was proved by the
   persecution of that time, and the opposition to him, yet his feeling
   against Basil was one to which men are liable.  For Momus seizes not
   only upon the common herd, but on the best of men, so that it belongs
   to God alone to be utterly uninfluenced by and proof against such
   feelings.  All the more eminent and wise portion of the Church was
   roused against him, if those are wiser than the majority who have
   separated themselves from the world and consecrated their life to God.
   I mean the Nazarites [4443] of our day, and those who devote themselves
   to such pursuits.  They were annoyed that their chief [4444] should be
   neglected, insulted, and rejected, and they ventured upon a most
   dangerous proceeding.  They determined to revolt and break off from the
   body of the Church, which admits of no faction, severing along with
   themselves no small fraction of the people, both of the lower ranks,
   and of those of position.  This was most easy, owing to three very
   strong reasons.  In the first place, the man was held in repute, beyond
   any other, I think, of the philosophers of our time, and able, if he
   wished, to inspire with courage the conspirators.  Next, his opponent
   [4445] was suspected by the city, in consequence of the tumult which
   accompanied his institution, of having obtained his preferment in an
   arbitrary manner, not according to the laws and canons.  Also there
   were present some of the bishops [4446] of the West, drawing to
   themselves all the orthodox members of the Church.

   29.  What then did our noble friend, the disciple of the Peaceable
   One?  It was not his habit to resist his traducers or partisans, nor
   was it his part to fight, or rend the body of the Church, which was
   from other reasons the subject of attack, and hardly bestead, from the
   great power of the heretics.  With my advice and earnest encouragement
   on the point, he set out from the place with me into Pontus, and
   presided over the abodes of contemplation there.  He himself too
   founded one [4447] worthy of mention, as he welcomed the desert
   together with Elijah and John, [4448] those professors of austerity;
   thinking this to be more profitable for him than to form any design in
   reference to the present juncture unworthy of his philosophy, and to
   ruin in a time of storm the straight course which he was making, where
   the surges of disputation were lulled to a calm.  Yet wonderfully
   philosophic though his retirement was, we shall find his return still
   more wonderful.  For thus it was.

   30.  While we were thus engaged, there suddenly arose a cloud full of
   hail, with destructive roar, overwhelming every Church upon which it
   burst and seized:  an Emperor, [4449] most fond of gold and most
   hostile to Christ, infected with these two most serious diseases,
   insatiate avarice and blasphemy; a persecutor in succession to the
   persecutor, and, in succession to the apostate, not indeed an apostate,
   though no better to Christians, or rather, to the more devout and pure
   party of Christians, who worship the Trinity, which I call the only
   true devotion and saving doctrine.  For we do not measure out the
   Godhead into portions, nor banish from Itself by unnatural
   estrangements the one and unapproachable Nature; nor cure one evil by
   another, destroying the godless confusion of Sabellius by a more
   impious severance and division; which was the error of Arius, whose
   name declares his madness, [4450] the disturber and destroyer of a
   great part of the Church.  For he did not honour the Father, by
   dishonouring His offspring with his unequal degrees of Godhead.  But we
   recognize one glory [4451] of the Father, the equality of the
   Only-begotten; and one glory of the Son, that of the Spirit.  And we
   hold that, to subordinate any of the Three, is to destroy the whole.
   For we worship and acknowledge Them as Three in their properties,
   [4452] but One in their Godhead.  He however had no such idea, being
   unable to look up, but being debased by those who led him, he dared to
   debase along with himself even the Nature of the Godhead, and became a
   wicked creature reducing Majesty to bondage, and aligning with creation
   the uncreated and timeless Nature.

   31.  Such was his mind, and with such impiety he took the field against
   us.  For we must consider it to be nothing else than a barbaric inroad
   which, instead of destroying walls, cities and houses, and other things
   of little worth, made with hands and capable of restoration, spent its
   ravages upon men's souls.  A worthy army joined in his assault, the
   evil rulers of the Churches, the bitter governors of his world-wide
   Empire.  Some of the Churches they now held, some they were assaulting,
   others they hoped to gain by the already exercised influence of the
   Emperor, and the violence which he threatened.  But in their purpose of
   perverting our own, their confidence was specially based on the
   smallness of mind of those whom I have mentioned, the inexperience of
   our prelate, and the infirmities which prevailed among us.  The
   struggle would be fierce:  the zeal of numerous troops was far from
   ignoble, but their array was weak, from the want of a leader and
   strategist to contend for them with the might of the Word and of the
   Spirit.  What then did this noble and magnanimous and truly
   Christ-loving soul?  No need of many words to urge his presence and
   aid.  At once when he saw me on my mission, for the struggle on behalf
   of the faith was common to us both, he yielded to my entreaty; and
   decided by a most excellent distinction, based on spiritual reasons,
   that the time for punctiliousness (if indeed we may give way to such
   feelings at all) is a time of security, but that forbearance is
   required in the hour of necessity.  He immediately returned with me
   from Pontus, and as a zealous volunteer took his place in the fight for
   the endangered truth, and devoted himself to the service of his mother,
   the Church.

   32.  Did then his actual efforts fall short of his preliminary zeal?
   Were they directed by courage, but not by prudence, or by skill, while
   he shrank from danger?  Or, in spite of their unexampled perfection on
   all these points, was there left in him some trace of irritation?  Far
   from it.  He was at once completely reconciled, and took part in every
   plan and effort.  He removed all the thorns and stumbling blocks which
   were in our way, upon which the enemy relied in their attack upon us.
   He took hold of one, grasped another, thrust away a third.  He became
   to some a stout wall and rampart, [4453] to others an axe breaking the
   rock in pieces, [4454] or a fire among the thorns, [4455] as the divine
   Scripture says, easily destroying those fagots who were insulting the
   Godhead.  And if his Barnabas, who speaks and records these things, was
   of service to Paul in the struggle, it is to Paul that thanks are due,
   for choosing and making him his comrade in the strife.

   33.  Thus the enemy failed, and, base men as they were, for the first
   time were then basely put to shame and worsted, learning not to be
   ready to despise the Cappadocians, of all men in the world, whose
   special qualities are firmness in the faith, and loyal devotion to the
   Trinity; to Whom is due their unity and strength, and from Whom they
   receive an even greater and stronger assistance than they are able to
   give.  Basil's next business and purpose was to conciliate the prelate,
   to allay suspicion, to persuade all men that the irritation which had
   been felt was due to the temptation and effort of the Evil one, in his
   envy of virtuous concord:  carefully complying with the laws of
   obedience and spiritual order.  Accordingly he visited him, with
   instruction and advice.  While obedient to his wishes, he was
   everything to him, a good counsellor, a skilful assistant, an expounder
   of the Divine Will, a guide of conduct, a staff for his old age, a
   support of the faith, most trusty of those within, most practical of
   those without, in a word, as much inclined to goodwill, as he had been
   thought to hostility.  And so the power of the Church came into his
   hands almost, if not quite, to an equal degree with the occupant of the
   see.  For in return for his good-will, he was requited with authority.
   And their harmony and combination of power was wonderful.  The one was
   the leader of the people, the other of their leader, like a
   lion-keeper, skilfully soothing the possessor of power.  For, having
   been recently installed in the see, and still somewhat under the
   influence of the world, and not yet furnished with the things of the
   Spirit, in the midst of the eddying tide of enemies assaulting the
   Church, he was in need of some one to take him by the hand and support
   him.  Accordingly he accepted the alliance, and imagined himself the
   conqueror of one who had conquered him.

   34.  Of his care for and protection of the Church, there are many other
   tokens; his boldness towards the governors and other most powerful men
   in the city:  the decisions of disputes, accepted without hesitation,
   and made effective by his simple word, his inclination being held to be
   decisive:  his support of the needy, most of them in spiritual, not a
   few also in physical distress:  for this also often influences the soul
   and reduces it to subjection by its kindness; the support of the poor,
   the entertainment of strangers, the care of maidens; legislation [4456]
   written and unwritten for the monastic life:  arrangements of prayers,
   [4457] adornments of the sanctuary, and other ways in which the true
   man of God, working for God, would benefit the people:  one being
   especially important and noteworthy.  There was a famine, the most
   severe one ever recorded.  The city was in distress, and there was no
   source of assistance, or relief for the calamity.  For maritime cities
   are able to bear such times of need without difficulty, by an exchange
   of their own products for what is imported:  but an inland city like
   ours can neither turn its superfluity to profit, nor supply its need,
   by either disposing of what we have, or importing what we have not:
   but the hardest part of all such distress is, the insensibility and
   insatiability of those who possess supplies.  For they watch their
   opportunities, and turn the distress to profit, and thrive upon
   misfortune:  heeding not that he who shows mercy to the poor, lendeth
   to the Lord, [4458] nor that he that withholdeth corn, the people shall
   curse him: [4459]   nor any other of the promises to the philanthropic,
   and threats against the inhuman.  But they are too insatiate, in their
   ill-judged policy; for while they shut up their bowels against their
   fellows, they shut up those of God against themselves, forgetting that
   their need of Him is greater than others' need of them.  Such are the
   buyers and sellers of corn, who neither respect their fellows, nor are
   thankful to God, from Whom comes what they have, while others are
   straitened.

   35.  He indeed could neither rain bread from heaven by prayer, [4460]
   to nourish an escaped people in the wilderness, [4461] nor supply
   fountains of food without cost from the depth of vessels which are
   filled by being emptied, [4462] and so, by an amazing return for her
   hospitality, support one who supported him; nor feed thousands of men
   with five loaves whose very fragments were a further supply for many
   tables. [4463]   These were the works of Moses and Elijah, and my God,
   from Whom they too derived their power.  Perhaps also they were
   characteristic of their time and its circumstances:  since signs are
   for unbelievers not for those who believe. [4464]   But he did devise
   and execute with the same faith things which correspond to them, and
   tend in the same direction.  For by his word and advice he opened the
   stores of those who possessed them, and so, according to the Scripture
   dealt food to the hungry, [4465] and satisfied the poor with bread,
   [4466] and fed them in the time of dearth, [4467] and filled the hungry
   souls with good things. [4468]   And in what way? for this is no slight
   addition to his praise.  He gathered together the victims of the famine
   with some who were but slightly recovering from it, men and women,
   infants, old men, every age which was in distress, and obtaining
   contributions of all sorts of food which can relieve famine, set before
   them basins of soup and such meat as was found preserved among us, on
   which the poor live.  Then, imitating the ministry of Christ, Who,
   girded with a towel, did not disdain to wash the disciples' feet, using
   for this purpose the aid of his own servants, and also of his fellow
   servants, he attended to the bodies and souls of those who needed it,
   combining personal respect with the supply of their necessity, and so
   giving them a double relief.

   36.  Such was our young furnisher of corn, and second Joseph:  though
   of him we can say somewhat more.  For the one made a gain from the
   famine, and bought up Egypt [4469] in his philanthropy, by managing the
   time of plenty with a view to the time of famine, turning to account
   the dreams of others for that purpose.  But the other's services were
   gratuitous, and his succour of the famine gained no profit, having only
   one object, to win kindly feelings by kindly treatment, and to gain by
   his rations of corn the heavenly blessings.  Further he provided the
   nourishment of the Word, and that more perfect bounty and distribution,
   which is really heavenly and from on high--if the word be that bread of
   angels, [4470] wherewith souls are fed and given to drink, who are a
   hungered for God, [4471] and seek for a food which does not pass away
   or fail, but abides forever.  This food he, who was the poorest and
   most needy man whom I have known, supplied in rich abundance to the
   relief not of a famine of bread, nor of a thirst for water, but a
   longing for that Word [4472] which is really lifegiving and nourishing,
   and causes to grow to spiritual manhood him who is duly fed thereon.

   37.  After these and similar actions--why need I stay to mention them
   all?--when the prelate whose name [4473] betokened his godliness had
   passed away, having sweetly breathed his last in Basil's arms, he was
   raised to the lofty throne of a Bishop, not without difficulty or
   without the envious struggles of the prelates of his native land, on
   whose side were found the greatest scoundrels of the city.  But the
   Holy Spirit must needs win the day--and indeed the victory was
   decisive.  For He brought from a distance, to anoint him, men [4474]
   illustrious and zealous for godliness, and with them the new Abraham,
   our Patriarch, I mean my father, in regard to whom an extraordinary
   thing happened.  For, failing as he was from the number of his years,
   and worn away almost to his last breath by disease, he ventured on the
   journey to give assistance by his vote, relying on the aid of the
   Spirit.  In brief, he was placed in his litter, as a corpse is laid in
   its tomb, to return in the freshness and strength of youth, with head
   erect, having been strengthened by the imposition of hands and unction,
   and, it is not too much to say by the head of him who was anointed.
   This must be added to the instances of old time, which prove that
   labour bestows health, zealous purpose raises the dead, and old age
   leaps up when anointed by the Spirit.

   38.  Having thus been deemed worthy of the office of prelate, as it is
   seemly that men should who have lived such a life, and won such favour
   and consideration, he did not disgrace, by his subsequent conduct,
   either his own philosophy, or the hopes of those who had trusted him.
   But he ever so far surpassed himself as he has been shown hitherto to
   have surpassed others, his ideas on this point being most excellent and
   philosophic.  For he held that, while it is virtuous in a private
   individual to avoid vice, and be to some extent good, it is a vice in a
   chief and ruler, especially in such an office, to fail to surpass by
   far the majority of men, and by constant progress to make his virtue
   correspond to his dignity and throne:  for it is difficult for one in
   high position to attain the mean, and by his eminence in virtue raise
   up his people to the golden mean.  Or rather to treat this question
   more satisfactorily, I think that the result is the same as I see in
   the case of our Saviour, and of every specially wise man, I fancy, when
   He was with us in that form which surpassed us and yet is ours.  For He
   also, the gospel says, increased in wisdom and favour, as well as in
   stature, [4475] not that these qualities in Him were capable of
   growth:  for how could that which was perfect from the first become
   more perfect, but that they were gradually disclosed and displayed?  So
   I think that the virtue of Basil, without being itself increased,
   obtained at this time a wider exercise, since his power provided him
   with more abundant material.

   39.  He first of all made it plain that his office had been bestowed
   upon him, not by human favour, but by the gift of God.  This will also
   be shown by my conduct.  For in what philosophic research did he not,
   about that time, join with me?  So every one thought that I should run
   to meet him after what had happened, and show my delight at it (as
   would, perhaps, have been the case with any one else) and claim a share
   in his authority, rather than rule beside him, according to the
   inferences they drew from our friendship.  But, in my exceeding anxiety
   to avoid the annoyance and jealousy of the time, and specially since
   his position was still a painful and troubled one, I remained at home,
   and forcibly restrained my eager desire, while, though he blamed me,
   Basil accepted my excuse.  And when, on my subsequent arrival, I
   refused, for the same reason the honour of this chair, and a dignified
   position [4476] among the Presbyters, he kindly refrained from blaming,
   nay he praised me, preferring to be charged with pride by a small
   clique, in their ignorance of our policy, rather than do anything
   contrary to reason and his own resolutions.  And indeed, how could a
   man have better shown his soul to be superior to all fawning and
   flattery, and his single object to be the law of right, than by thus
   treating me, whom he acknowledged as among the first of his friends and
   associates?

   40.  His next task was to appease, and allay by magnanimous treatment,
   the opposition to himself:  and that without any trace of flattery or
   servility, but in a most chivalrous and magnanimous way; with a view,
   not merely to present exigencies, but also to the fostering of future
   obedience.  For, seeing that, while tenderness leads to laxity and
   slackness, severity gives rise to stubbornness and self-will, he was
   able to avoid the dangers of each course by a combination of both,
   blending his correction with consideration, and gentleness with
   firmness, influencing men in most cases principally by his conduct
   rather than by argument:  not enslaving them by art, but winning them
   by good nature, and attracting them by the sparing use, rather than by
   the constant exercise, of his power.  And, most important of all, they
   were brought to recognize the superiority of his intellect and the
   inaccessibility of his virtue, to consider their only safety to consist
   in being on his side and under his command, their sole danger to be in
   opposition to him, and to think that to differ from him involved
   estrangement from God.  Thus they willingly yielded and surrendered,
   submitting themselves, as if in a thunder-clap, and hastening to
   anticipate each other with their excuses, and exchange the intensity of
   their hostility for an equal intensity of goodwill, and advance in
   virtue, which they found to be the one really effective defence.  The
   few exceptions to this conduct were passed by and neglected, because
   their ill-nature was incurable, and they expended their powers in
   wearing out themselves, as rust consumes itself together with the iron
   on which it feeds.

   41.  Affairs at home being now settled to his mind, in a way that
   faithless men who did not know him would have thought impossible, his
   designs became greater and took a loftier range.  For, while all others
   had their eyes on the ground before them, and directed attention to
   their own immediate concerns, and, if these were safe, troubled
   themselves no further, being incapable of any great and chivalrous
   design or undertaking; he, moderate as he was in all other respects,
   could not be moderate in this, but with head erect, casting his mental
   eye about him, took in the whole world over which the word of salvation
   has made its way.  And when he saw the great heritage of God, purchased
   by His own words and laws and sufferings, the holy nation, the royal
   priesthood, [4477] in such evil plight that it was torn asunder into
   ten thousand opinions and errors:  and the vine brought out of Egypt
   and transplanted, [4478] the Egypt of impious and dark ignorance, which
   had grown to such beauty and boundless size that the whole earth was
   covered with the shadow of it, while it overtopped mountains and
   cedars, now being ravaged by that wicked wild boar, the devil, he could
   not content himself with quietly lamenting the misfortune, and merely
   lifting up his hands to God, and seeking from Him the dispersion of the
   pressing misfortunes, while he himself was asleep, but felt bound to
   come to her aid at some expense to himself.

   42.  For what could be more distressing than this calamity, or call
   more loudly on one whose eyes were raised aloft for exertions on behalf
   of the common weal?  The good or ill success of an individual is of no
   consequence to the community, but that of the community involves of
   necessity the like condition of the individual.  With this idea and
   purpose, he who was the guardian and patron of the community (and, as
   Solomon says with truth, a perceptive heart is a moth to the bones,
   [4479] unsensitiveness is cheerily confident, while a sympathetic
   disposition is a source of pain, and constant consideration wastes away
   the heart), he, I say, was consequently in agony and distress from many
   wounds; like Jonah and David, he wished in himself to die [4480] and
   gave not sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, [4481] he
   expended what was left of his flesh upon his reflections, until he
   discovered a remedy for the evil:  and sought for aid from God and man,
   to stay the general conflagration, and dissipate the gloom which was
   lowering over us.

   43.  One of his devices was of the greatest service.  After a period of
   such recollection as was possible, and private spiritual conference, in
   which, after considering all human arguments, and penetrating into all
   the deep things of the Scriptures, he drew up a sketch of pious
   doctrine, and by wrestling with and attacking their opposition he beat
   off the daring assaults of the heretics:  overthrowing in hand to hand
   struggles by word of mouth those who came to close quarters, and
   striking those at a distance by arrows winged with ink, which is in no
   wise inferior to inscriptions on tablets; not giving directions for one
   small nation only like that of the Jews, concerning meats and drinks,
   temporary sacrifices, and purifications of the flesh; [4482] but for
   every nation and part of the world, concerning the Word of truth, the
   source of our salvation.  Again, since unreasoning action and
   unpractical reasoning are alike ineffectual, he added to his reasoning
   the succour which comes from action; he paid visits, sent messages,
   gave interviews, instructed, reproved, rebuked, [4483] threatened,
   reproached, undertook the defence of nations, cities and individuals,
   devising every kind of succour, and procuring from every source
   specifics for disease:  a second Bezaleel, an architect of the Divine
   tabernacle, [4484] applying every material and art to the work, and
   combining all in a harmonious and surpassing beauty.

   44.  Why need I enter into further detail?  We were assailed again by
   the Anti-Christian Emperor, [4485] that tyrant of the faith, with more
   abundant impiety and a hotter onset, inasmuch as the dispute must be
   with a stronger antagonist, like that unclean and evil spirit, who when
   sent forth upon his wanderings from man, returns to take up his abode
   in him again with a greater number of spirits, as we have heard in the
   Gospels. [4486]   This spirit he imitated, both in renewing the contest
   in which he had formerly been worsted, and in adding to his original
   efforts.  He thought that it was a strange and insufferable thing that
   he, who ruled over so many nations and had won so much renown, and
   reduced under the power of impiety all those round about him, and
   overcome every adversary, should be publicly worsted by a single man,
   and a single city, and so incur the ridicule not only of those patrons
   of ungodliness by whom he was led, but also, as he supposed, of all
   men.

   45.  It is said that the King [4487] of Persia, on his expedition into
   Greece, was not only urged to immoderate threats, by elation at the
   numbers of every race of men which in his wrath and pride he was
   leading against them:  but thought to terrify them the more, by making
   them afraid of him, in consequence of his novel treatment of the
   elements.  A strange land and sea were heard of, the work of the new
   creator; and an army which sailed over the dry land, and marched over
   the ocean, while islands were carried off, and the sea was scourged,
   and all the other mad proceedings of that army and expedition, which,
   though they struck terror into the ignoble, were ridiculous in the eyes
   of men of brave and steadfast hearts.  There was no need of anything of
   this kind in the expedition against us, but what was still worse and
   more harmful, this was what the Emperor was reported to say and do.  He
   stretched forth his mouth unto heaven, speaking blasphemy against the
   most High, and his tongue went through the world. [4488]   Excellently
   did the inspired David before our days thus describe him who made
   heaven to stoop to earth, and reckoned with the creation that
   supermundane nature, which the creation cannot even contain, even
   though in kindness to man it did to some extent come among us, in order
   to draw to itself us who were lying upon the ground.

   46.  Furious indeed were his first acts of wantonness, more furious
   still his final efforts against us.  What shall I speak of first?
   Exiles, banishments, confiscations, open and secret plots, persuasion,
   where time allowed, violence, where persuasion was impossible.  Those
   who clung to the orthodox faith, as we did, were extruded from their
   churches; others were intruded, who agreed with the Imperial
   soul-destroying doctrines, and begged for testimonials of impiety, and
   subscribed to statements still harder than these.  Burnings [4489] of
   Presbyters at sea, impious generals, not those who conquered the
   Persians, or subdued the Scythians, or reduced any other barbaric
   nation, but those who assailed churches, and danced in triumph upon
   altars, and defiled the unbloody sacrifices with the blood of man and
   victims, and offered insult to the modesty of virgins.  With what
   object?  The extrusion of the Patriarch Jacob, [4490] and the intrusion
   in his place of Esau, who was hated, [4491] even before his birth.
   This is the description of his first acts of wantonness, the mere
   recollection and mention of which even now, rouses the tears of most of
   us.

   47.  Accordingly, when, after passing through all quarters, he made his
   attack in order to enslave this impregnable and formidable mother of
   the Churches, the only still remaining unquenched spark of the truth,
   he discovered that he had been for the first time ill advised.  For he
   was driven back like a missile which strikes upon some stronger body,
   and recoiled like a broken hawser.  Such was the prelate of the Church
   that he met with, such was the bulwark by which his efforts were broken
   and dissipated.  Other particulars may be heard from those who tell and
   recount them, from their own experience--and none of those who recount
   them is destitute of this full experience.  But all must be filled with
   admiration who are aware of the struggles of that time, the assaults,
   the promises, the threats, the commissioners sent before him to try to
   prevail upon us, men of judicial and military rank, men from the harem,
   who are men among women, women among men, whose only manliness
   consisted in their impiety, and being incapable of natural
   licentiousness, commit fornication in the only way they can, with their
   tongues; the chief cook Nebuzaradan, [4492] who threatened us with the
   weapons of his art, and was despatched by his own fire.  But what
   especially excites my wonder, and what I could not, even if I would,
   pass by, I will describe as concisely as possible.

   48.  Who has not heard of the prefect [4493] of those days, who, for
   his own part, treated us with such excessive arrogance, having himself
   been admitted, or perhaps committed, to baptism by the other party; and
   strove by exceeding the letter of his instructions, and gratifying his
   master in every particular, to guarantee and preserve his own
   possession of power.  Though he raged against the Church, and assumed a
   lion-like aspect, and roared like a lion till most men dared not
   approach him, yet our noble prelate was brought into or rather entered
   his court, as if bidden to a feast, instead of to a trial.  How can I
   fully describe, either the arrogance of the prefect or the prudence
   with which it was met by the Saint.  "What is the meaning, Sir Basil,"
   he said, addressing him by name, and not as yet deigning to term him
   Bishop, "of your daring, as no other dares, to resist and oppose so
   great a potentate?"  "In what respect?" said our noble champion, "and
   in what does my rashness consist?  For this I have yet to learn."  "In
   refusing to respect the religion of your Sovereign, when all others
   have yielded and submitted themselves?"  "Because," said he, "this is
   not the will of my real Sovereign; nor can I, who am the creature of
   God, and bidden myself to be God, submit to worship any creature."
   "And what do we," said the prefect, "seem to you to be?  Are we, who
   give you this injunction, nothing at all?  What do you say to this?  Is
   it not a great thing to be ranged with us as your associates?"  "You
   are, I will not deny it," said he, "a prefect, and an illustrious one,
   yet not of more honour than God.  And to be associated with you is a
   great thing, certainly; for you are yourself the creature of God; but
   so it is to be associated with any other of my subjects.  For faith,
   and not personal importance, is the distinctive mark of Christianity."

   49.  Then indeed the prefect became excited, and rose from his seat,
   boiling with rage, and making use of harsher language.  "What?" said
   he, "have you no fear of my authority?  "Fear of what?" said Basil,
   "How could it affect me?"  "Of what?  Of any one of the resources of my
   power."  "What are these?" said Basil, "pray, inform me."
   "Confiscation, banishment, torture, death."  "Have you no other
   threat?" said he, "for none of these can reach me."  "How indeed is
   that?" said the prefect.  "Because," he replied, "a man who has
   nothing, is beyond the reach of confiscation; unless you demand my
   tattered rags, and the few books, which are my only possessions.
   Banishment is impossible for me, who am confined by no limit of place,
   counting my own neither the land where I now dwell, nor all of that
   into which I may be hurled; or, rather, counting it all God's, whose
   guest and dependent I am.  As for tortures, what hold can they have
   upon one whose body has ceased to be?  Unless you mean the first
   stroke, for this alone is in your power.  Death is my benefactor, for
   it will send me the sooner to God, for Whom I live, and exist, and have
   all but died, and to Whom I have long been hastening."

   50.  Amazed at this language, the prefect said, "No one has ever yet
   spoken thus, and with such boldness, to Modestus."  "Why, perhaps,"
   said Basil, "you have not met with a Bishop, or in his defence of such
   interests he would have used precisely the same language.  For we are
   modest in general, and submissive to every one, according to the
   precept of our law.  We may not treat with haughtiness even any
   ordinary person, to say nothing of so great a potentate.  But where the
   interests of God are at stake, we care for nothing else, and make these
   our sole object.  Fire and sword and wild beasts, and rakes which tear
   the flesh, we revel in, and fear them not.  You may further insult and
   threaten us, and do whatever you will, to the full extent of your
   power.  The Emperor himself may hear this--that neither by violence nor
   persuasion will you bring us to make common cause with impiety, not
   even though your threats become still more terrible."

   51.  At the close of this colloquy, the prefect, having been convinced
   by the attitude of Basil, that he was absolutely impervious to threats
   and influence, dismissed him from the court, his former threatening
   manner being replaced by somewhat of respect and deference.  He himself
   with all speed obtained an audience of the Emperor, and said:  "We have
   been worsted, Sire, by the prelate of this Church.  He is superior to
   threats, invincible in argument, uninfluenced by persuasion.  We must
   make trial of some more feeble character; and in this case resort to
   open violence, or submit to the disregard of our threatenings."
   Hereupon the Emperor, forced by the praises of Basil to condemn his own
   conduct (for even an enemy can admire a man's excellence), would not
   allow violence to be used against him:  and, like iron, which is
   softened by fire, yet still remains iron, though turned from
   threatening to admiration, would not enter into communion with him,
   being prevented by shame from changing his course, but sought to
   justify his conduct by the most plausible excuse he could, as the
   sequel will show.

   52.  For he entered the Church attended by the whole of his train; it
   was the festival of the Epiphany, and the Church was crowded, and, by
   taking his place among the people, he made a profession of unity.  The
   occurrence is not to be lightly passed over.  Upon his entrance he was
   struck by the thundering roll of the Psalms, by the sea of heads of the
   congregation, and by the angelic rather than human order which pervaded
   the sanctuary and its precincts:  while Basil presided over his people,
   standing erect, as the Scripture says of Samuel, [4494] with body and
   eyes and mind undisturbed, as if nothing new had happened, but fixed
   upon God and the sanctuary, as if, so to say, he had been a statue,
   while his ministers stood around him in fear and reverence.  At this
   sight, and it was indeed a sight unparalleled, overcome by human
   weakness, his eyes were affected with dimness and giddiness, his mind
   with dread.  This was as yet unnoticed by most people.  But when he had
   to offer the gifts at the Table of God, which he must needs do himself,
   since no one would, as usual, assist him, because it was uncertain
   whether Basil would admit him, his feelings were revealed.  For he was
   staggering, and had not some one in the sanctuary reached out a hand to
   steady his tottering steps, he would have sunk to the ground in a
   lamentable fall.  So much for this.

   53.  As for the wisdom of his conference with the Emperor, who, in his
   quasi-communion with us entered within the veil to see and speak to
   him, as he had long desired to do, what else can I say but that they
   were inspired words, which were heard by the courtiers and by us who
   had entered with them?  This was the beginning and first establishment
   of the Emperor's kindly feeling towards us; the impression produced by
   this reception put an end to the greater part of the persecution which
   assailed us like a river.

   54.  Another incident is not of less importance than those I have
   mentioned.  The wicked were victorious, and the decree for his
   banishment was signed, to the full satisfaction of those who furthered
   it.  The night had come, the chariot was ready, our haters were
   exultant, the pious in despair, we surrounded the zealous traveller, to
   whose honourable disgrace nothing was wanting.  What next?  It was
   undone by God.  For He Who smote the first-born of Egypt, [4495] for
   its harshness towards Israel, also struck the son of the Emperor with
   disease.  How great was the speed!  There was the sentence of
   banishment, here the decree of sickness:  the hand of the wicked scribe
   was restrained, and the saint was preserved, and the man of piety
   presented to us, by the fever which brought to reason the arrogance of
   the Emperor.  What could be more just or more speedy than this?  This
   was the series of events:  the Emperor's child was sick and in bodily
   pain.  The father was pained for it, for what can the father do?  On
   all sides he sought for aid in his distress, he summoned the best
   physicians, he betook himself to intercessions with the greatest
   fervour, and flung himself upon the ground.  Affliction humbles even
   emperors, and no wonder, for the like sufferings of David in the case
   of his child are recorded for us. [4496]   But as no cure for the evil
   could anywhere be found, he applied to the faith of Basil, not
   personally summoning him, in shame for his recent ill treatment, but
   entrusting the mission to others of his nearest and dearest friends.
   On his arrival, without the delay or reluctance which any one else
   might have shown, at once the disease relaxed, and the father cherished
   better hopes; and had he not blended salt water with the fresh, by
   trusting to the heterodox at the same time that he summoned Basil, the
   child would have recovered his health and been preserved for his
   father's arms.  This indeed was the conviction of those who were
   present at the time, and shared in the distress.

   55.  The same mischance is said to have befallen the prefect.  He also
   was obliged by sickness to bow beneath the hands of the Saint, and, in
   reality, to men of sense a visitation brings instruction, and
   affliction is often better than prosperity.  He fell sick, was in
   tears, and in pain, he sent for Basil, and entreated him, crying out,
   "I own that you were in the right; only save me!"  His request was
   granted, as he himself acknowledged, and convinced many who had known
   nothing of it; for he never ceased to wonder at and describe the powers
   of the prelate.  Such was his conduct in these cases, such its result.
   Did he then treat others in a different way, and engage in petty
   disputes about trifles, or fail to rise to the heights of philosophy in
   a course of action which merits no praise and is best passed over in
   silence?  By no means.  He who once stirred up the wicked Hadad against
   Israel, [4497] stirred up against him the prefect [4498] of the
   province of Pontus; nominally, from annoyance connected with some poor
   creature of a woman, but in reality as a part of the struggle of
   impiety against the truth.  I pass by all his other insults against
   Basil, or, for it is the same thing, against God; for it is against Him
   and on His behalf that the contest was waged.  One instance of it,
   however, which brought special disgrace upon the assailant, and exalted
   his adversary, if philosophy and eminence for it be a great and lofty
   thing, I will describe at length.

   56.  The assessor of a judge was attempting to force into a distasteful
   marriage a lady of high birth whose husband was but recently dead.  At
   a loss to escape from this high-handed treatment, she resorted to a
   device no less prudent than daring.  She fled to the holy table, and
   placed herself under the protection of God against outrage.  What, in
   the Name of the Trinity Itself, if I may introduce into my panegyric
   somewhat of the forensic style, ought to have been done, I do not say,
   by the great Basil, who laid down the law for us all in such matters,
   but by any one who, though far inferior to him, was a priest?  Ought he
   not to have allowed her claim, to have taken charge of, and cared for,
   her; to have raised his hand in defence of the kindness of God and the
   law which gives honour to the altar?  Ought he not to have been willing
   to do and suffer anything, rather than take part in any inhuman design
   against her, and outrage at once the holy table, and the faith in which
   she had taken sanctuary?  No! said the baffled judge, all ought to
   yield to my authority, and Christians should betray their own laws.
   The suppliant whom he demanded, was at all hazards retained.
   Accordingly, in his rage, he at last sent some of the magistrates to
   search the saint's bedchamber, with the purpose of dishonouring him,
   rather than from any necessity.  What!  Search the house of a man so
   free from passion, whom the angels revere, at whom women do not venture
   even to look?  And, not content with this, he summoned him, and put him
   on his defence; and that, in no gentle or kindly manner, but as if he
   were a convict.  Upon Basil's appearance, standing, like my Jesus,
   before the judgment seat of Pilate, he presided at the trial, full of
   wrath and pride.  Yet the thunderbolts did not fall, and the sword of
   God still glittered, and waited, while His bow, though bent, was
   restrained.  Such indeed is the custom of God.

   57.  Consider another struggle between our champion and his
   persecutor.  His ragged pallium having been ordered to be torn away, "I
   will also, if you wish it, strip off my coat," said he.  His fleshless
   form was threatened with blows, and he offered to submit to be torn
   with combs, and he said, "By such laceration you will cure my liver,
   which, as you see, is wearing me away."  Such was their argument.  But
   when the city perceived the outrage and the common danger of all--for
   each one considered this insolence a danger to himself, it became all
   on fire with rage; and, like a hive roused by smoke, one after another
   was stirred and arose, every race and every age, but especially the men
   from the small-arms factory and from the imperial weaving-sheds.  For
   men at work in these trades are specially hot-tempered and daring,
   because of the liberty allowed them.  Each man was armed with the tool
   he was using, or with whatever else came to hand at the moment.  Torch
   in hand, amid showers of stones, with cudgel's ready, all ran and
   shouted together in their united zeal.  Anger makes a terrible soldier
   or general.  Nor were the women weaponless, when roused by such an
   occasion.  Their pins were their spears, and no longer remaining women,
   they were by the strength of their eagerness endowed with masculine
   courage.  It is a short story.  They thought that they would share
   among themselves the piety of destroying him, and held him to be most
   pious who first laid hands on one who had dared such deeds.  What then
   was the conduct of this haughty and daring judge?  He begged for mercy
   in a pitiable state of distress, cringing before them to an
   unparalleled extent, until the arrival of the martyr without bloodshed,
   who had won his crown without blows, and now restrained the people by
   the force of his personal influence, and delivered the man who had
   insulted him and now sought his protection.  This was the doing of the
   God of Saints, Who worketh and changeth all things for the best, who
   resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. [4499]   And why
   should not He, Who divided the sea and stayed the river, and ruled the
   elements, and by stretching out set up a trophy, to save His exiled
   people, why should not He have also rescued this man from his perils?

   58.  This was the end and fortunate close, in the Providence of God, of
   the war with the world, a close worthy of his faith.  But here at once
   is the beginning of the war with the Bishops, and their allies, which
   involved great disgrace, and still greater injury to their subjects.
   For who could persuade others to be temperate, when such was the
   conduct of their prelates?  For a long time they had been unkindly
   disposed towards him, on three grounds.  They neither agreed with him
   in the matter of the faith, except in so far as they were absolutely
   obliged to yield to the majority of the faithful.  Nor had they
   altogether laid aside the grudge they owed him for his election.  And,
   what was most grievous of all to them, though they would have been most
   ashamed to own it--he so far outshone them in reputation.  There was
   also a further cause of dissension which stirred up again the others.
   When our country had been divided into two provinces and metropolitical
   sees, and a great part of the former was being added to the new one,
   this again roused their factious spirit.  The one [4500] thought it
   right that the ecclesiastical boundaries should be settled by the civil
   ones:  and therefore claimed those newly added, as belonging to him,
   and severed from their former metropolitan.  The other [4501] clung to
   the ancient custom, and to the division which had come down from our
   fathers.  Many painful results either actually followed, or were
   struggling in the womb of the future.  Synods were wrongfully gathered
   by the new metropolitan, and revenues seized upon.  Some of the
   presbyters of the churches refused obedience, others were won over.  In
   consequence the affairs of the churches fell into a sad state of
   dissension and division.  Novelty indeed has a certain charm for men,
   and they readily turn events to their own advantage, and it is easier
   to overthrow something which is already established, than to restore it
   when overthrown.  What however enraged him most was, that the revenues
   [4502] of the Taurus, which passed along before his eyes, accrued to
   his rival, as also the offerings at Saint Orestes', [4503] of which he
   was greatly desirous to reap the fruits.  He even went so far as, on
   one occasion when Basil was riding along his own road, to seize his
   mules by the bridle and bar the passage with a robber band.  And with
   how specious a pretext, the care of his spiritual children and of the
   souls entrusted to him, and the defence of the faith--pretexts which
   veiled that most common vice, insatiable avarice--and further, the
   wrongfulness of paying dues to heretics, a heretic being any one who
   had displeased him.

   59.  The holy man of God however, metropolitan as he was of the true
   Jerusalem above, was neither carried away with the failure of those who
   fell, nor allowed himself to overlook this conduct, nor did he desire
   any inadequate remedy for the evil.  Let us see how great and wonderful
   it was, or, I would say, how worthy of his soul.  He made of the
   dissension a cause of increase to the Church, and the disaster, under
   his most able management, resulted in the multiplication of the Bishops
   of the country.  From this ensued three most desirable consequences; a
   greater care for souls, the management by each city of its own affairs,
   and the cessation of the war in this quarter.  I am afraid that I
   myself was treated as an appendage to this scheme.  By no other term
   can I readily describe the position.  Greatly as I admire his whole
   conduct, to an extent indeed beyond my powers of expression, of this
   single particular I find it impossible to approve, for I will
   acknowledge my feelings in regard to it, though these are from other
   sources not unknown to most of you.  I mean the change and
   faithlessness of his treatment of myself, a cause of pain which even
   time has not obliterated.  For this is the source of all the
   inconsistency and tangle of my life; it has robbed me of the practice,
   or at least the reputation, of philosophy; of small moment though the
   latter be.  The defence, which you will perhaps allow me to make for
   him, is this; his ideas were superhuman, and having, before his death,
   become superior to worldly influences, his only interests were those of
   the Spirit:  while his regard for friendship was in no wise lessened by
   his readiness then, and then only, to disregard its claims, when they
   were in conflict with his paramount duty to God, and when the end he
   had in view was of greater importance than the interests he was
   compelled to set aside.

   60.  I am afraid that, in avoiding the imputation of indifference at
   the hands of those who desire to know all that can be said about him, I
   shall incur a charge of prolixity from those whose ideal is the golden
   mean.  For the latter Basil himself had the greatest respect, being
   specially devoted to the adage "In all things the mean [4504] is the
   best," and acting upon it throughout his life.  Nevertheless,
   disregarding alike those who desire undue conciseness or excessive
   prolixity, I proceed thus with my speech.  Different men attain success
   in different ways, some applying themselves to one alone of the many
   forms of excellence, but no one, of those hitherto known to me,
   arriving at the highest eminence in all respects; he being in my
   opinion the best, who has won his laurels on the widest field, or
   gained the highest possible renown in some single particular.  Such
   however was the height of Basil's fame, that he became the pride of
   human kind.  Let us consider the matter thus.  Is any one devoted to
   poverty and a life devoid of property, and free from superfluity?  What
   did he possess besides his body, and the necessary coverings of the
   flesh?  His wealth was the having nothing, and he thought the cross,
   with which he lived, more precious than great riches.  For no one,
   however much he may wish, can obtain possession of all things, but any
   one can learn to despise, and so prove himself superior to, all
   things.  Such being his mind, and such his life, he had no need of an
   altar and of vainglory, nor of such a public announcement as "Crates
   [4505] sets Crates the Theban free."  For his aim was ever to be, not
   to seem, most excellent.  Nor did he dwell in a tub, [4506] and in the
   midst of the market-place, and so by luxuriating in publicity turn his
   poverty into riches:  but was poor and unkempt, yet without
   ostentation:  and taking cheerfully the casting overboard of all that
   he ever had, sailed lightly across the sea of life.

   61.  A wondrous thing is temperance, and fewness of wants, and freedom
   from the dominion of pleasures, and from the bondage of that cruel and
   degrading mistress, the belly.  Who was so independent of food, and,
   without exaggeration, more free from the flesh?  For he flung away all
   satiety and surfeit to creatures destitute of reason, whose life is
   slavish and debasing.  He paid little attention to such things as, next
   to the appetite, are of equal rank, but, as far as possible, lived on
   the merest necessaries, his only luxury being to prove himself not
   luxurious, and not, in consequence, to have greater needs:  but he
   looked to the lilies and the birds, [4507] whose beauty is artless, and
   their food casual, according to the important advice of my Christ, who
   made Himself poor [4508] in the flesh for our sakes, that we might
   enjoy the riches of His Godhead.  Hence came his single coat and well
   worn cloak, and his bed on the bare ground, his vigils, his
   unwashedness (such were his decorations) and his most sweet food and
   relish, bread, and salt, his new dainty, and the sober and plentiful
   drink, with which fountains supply those who are free from trouble.
   The result, or the accompaniment, of these things were the attendance
   on the sick and practice of medicine, our common intellectual pursuit.
   For, though inferior to him in all other respects, I must needs be his
   equal in distress.

   62.  A great thing is virginity, and celibacy, and being ranked with
   the angels, and with the single nature; for I shrink from calling it
   Christ's, Who, though He willed to be born for our sakes who are born,
   by being born of a Virgin, enacted [4509] the law of virginity, to lead
   us away from this life, and cut short the power of the world, or
   rather, to transmit one world to another, the present to the future.
   Who then paid more honour to virginity, or had more control of the
   flesh, not only by his personal example, but in those under his care?
   Whose are the convents, and the written regulations, by which he
   subdued every sense, and regulated every member, and won to the real
   practice of virginity, turning inward the view of beauty, from the
   visible to the invisible; and by wasting away the external, and
   withdrawing fuel from the flame, and revealing the secrets of the heart
   to God, Who is the only bridegroom of pure souls, and takes in with
   himself the watchful souls, if they go to meet him with lamps burning
   and a plentiful supply of oil? [4510]   Moreover he reconciled most
   excellently and united the solitary and the community life.  These had
   been in many respects at variance and dissension, while neither of them
   was in absolute and unalloyed possession of good or evil:  the one
   being more calm and settled, tending to union with God, yet not free
   from pride, inasmuch as its virtue lies beyond the means of testing or
   comparison; the other, which is of more practical service, being not
   free from the tendency to turbulence.  He founded cells [4511] for
   ascetics and hermits, but at no great distance from his cenobitic
   communities, and, instead of distinguishing and separating the one from
   the other, as if by some intervening wall, he brought them together and
   united them, in order that the contemplative spirit might not be cut
   off from society, nor the active life be uninfluenced by the
   contemplative, but that, like sea and land, by an interchange of their
   several gifts, they might unite in promoting the one object, the glory
   of God.

   63.  What more?  A noble thing is philanthropy, and the support of the
   poor, and the assistance of human weakness.  Go forth a little way from
   the city, and behold the new city, [4512] the storehouse of piety, the
   common treasury of the wealthy, in which the superfluities of their
   wealth, aye, and even their necessaries, are stored, in consequence of
   his exhortations, freed from the power of the moth, [4513] no longer
   gladdening the eyes of the thief, and escaping both the emulation of
   envy, and the corruption of time:  where disease is regarded in a
   religious light, and disaster is thought a blessing, and sympathy is
   put to the test.  Why should I compare with this work Thebes [4514] of
   the seen portals, and the Egyptian Thebes, and the walls of Babylon,
   and the Carian tomb of Mausolus, and the Pyramids, and the bronze
   without weight of the Colossus, or the size and beauty of shrines that
   are no more, and all the other objects of men's wonder, and historic
   record, from which their founders gained no advantage, except a slight
   meed of fame.  My subject is the most wonderful of all, the short road
   to salvation, the easiest ascent to heaven.  There is no longer before
   our eyes that terrible and piteous spectacle of men who are living
   corpses, the greater part of whose limbs have mortified, driven away
   from their cities and homes and public places and fountains, aye, and
   from their own dearest ones, recognizable by their names rather than by
   their features:  they are no longer brought before us at our gatherings
   and meetings, in our common intercourse and union, no longer the
   objects of hatred, instead of pity on account of their disease;
   composers of piteous songs, if any of them have their voice still left
   to them.  Why should I try to express in tragic style all our
   experiences, when no language can be adequate to their hard lot?  He
   however it was, who took the lead in pressing upon those who were men,
   that they ought not to despise their fellowmen, nor to dishonour
   Christ, the one Head of all, by their inhuman treatment of them; but to
   use the misfortunes of others as an opportunity of firmly establishing
   their own lot, and to lend to God that mercy of which they stand in
   need at His hands.  He did not therefore disdain to honour with his
   lips this disease, noble and of noble ancestry and brilliant reputation
   though he was, but saluted them as brethren, not, as some might
   suppose, from vainglory, (for who was so far removed from this
   feeling?) but taking the lead in approaching to tend them, as a
   consequence of his philosophy, and so giving not only a speaking, but
   also a silent, instruction.  The effect produced is to be seen not only
   in the city, but in the country and beyond, and even the leaders of
   society have vied with one another in their philanthropy and
   magnanimity towards them.  Others have had their cooks, and splendid
   tables, and the devices and dainties of confectioners, and exquisite
   carriages, and soft, flowing robes; Basil's care was for the sick, and
   the relief of their wounds, and the imitation of Christ, by cleansing
   leprosy, not by a word, but in deed.

   64.  As to all this, what will be said by those who charge him with
   pride and haughtiness?  Severe critics they are of such conduct,
   applying to him, whose life was a standard, those who were not
   standards at all.  Is it possible that he who kissed the lepers, and
   humiliated himself to such a degree, could treat haughtily those who
   were in health:  and, while wasting his flesh by abstinence, puff out
   his soul with empty arrogance?  Is it possible to condemn the Pharisee,
   and expound the debasing effect of haughtiness, to know Christ, Who
   condescended to the form of a slave, and ate with publicans, and washed
   the disciples' feet, and did not disdain the cross, in order to nail my
   sin to it:  and, more incredible still, to see God crucified, aye,
   along with robbers also, and derided by the passers by, impassible, and
   beyond the reach of suffering as He is; and yet, as his slanderers
   imagine, soar himself above the clouds, and think that nothing can be
   on an equality with him.  Nay, what they term pride is, I fancy, the
   firmness and steadfastness and stability of his character.  Such
   persons would readily, it seems to me, call bravery rashness, and the
   circumspect a coward, and the temperate misanthropic, and the just
   illiberal.  For indeed this philosophic axiom is excellent, which says
   that the vices [4515] are settled close to the virtues, and are, in
   some sense, their next-door neighbours:  and it is most easy, for those
   whose training in such subjects has been defective, to mistake a man
   for what he is not.  For who honoured virtue and castigated vice more
   than he, or showed himself more kind to the upright, more severe to the
   wrong doers?  His very smile often amounted to praise, his silence to
   rebuke, racking the evil in the secret conscience.  And if a man have
   not been a chatterer, and jester, and gossip, nor a general favourite,
   because of having pleased others by becoming all things to all men,
   [4516] what of that?  Is he not in the eyes of sensible men worthy of
   praise rather than of blame?  Unless it is a fault in the lion that he
   is terrible and royal, and does not look like an ape, and that his
   spring is noble, and is valued for its wonderfulness:  while
   stage-players ought to win our admiration for their pleasant and
   philanthropic characters, because they please the vulgar, and raise a
   laugh by their sounding slaps in the face.  And if this indeed be our
   object, who was so pleasant when you met him, as I know, who have had
   the longest experience?  Who was more kindly in his stories, more
   refined in his wit, more tender in his rebukes?  His reproofs gave rise
   to no arrogance, his relaxation to no dissipation, but avoiding excess
   in either, he made use of both in reason and season, according to the
   rules of Solomon, who assigns to every business a season. [4517]

   65.  But what are these to his renown for eloquence, and his powers of
   instruction, which have won the favour of the ends of the world?  As
   yet we have been compassing the foot of the mountain, to the neglect of
   its summit, as yet we have been crossing a strait, paying no heed to
   the mighty and deep ocean.  For I think that if any one ever has
   become, or can become, a trumpet, in his far sounding resonance, or a
   voice of God, embracing the universe, or an earthquake of the world, by
   some unheard of miracle, it is his voice and intellect which deserve
   these titles, for surpassing and excelling all men as much as we
   surpass the irrational creatures.  Who, more than he, cleansed himself
   by the Spirit, and made himself worthy to set forth divine things?  Who
   was more enlightened by the light of knowledge, and had a closer
   insight into the depths of the Spirit, and by the aid of God beheld the
   things of God?  Whose language could better express intellectual truth,
   without, as most men do, limping on one foot, by either failing to
   express his ideas, or allowing his eloquence to outstrip his reasoning
   powers?  In both respects he won a like distinction, and showed himself
   to be his own equal, and absolutely perfect.  To search all things,
   yea, the deep things of God [4518] is, according to the testimony of S.
   Paul, the office of the Spirit, not because He is ignorant of them, but
   because He takes delight in their contemplation.  Now all the things of
   the Spirit Basil had fully investigated, and hence he drew his
   instructions for every kind of character, his lessons in the sublime,
   and his exhortations to quit things present, and adapt ourselves to
   things to come.

   66.  The sun is extolled by David for its beauty, its greatness, its
   swift course, and its power, splendid as a bridegroom, majestic as a
   giant; [4519] while, from the extent of its circuit, it has such power
   that it equally sheds its light from one end of heaven to the other,
   and the heat thereof is in no wise lessened by distance.  Basil's
   beauty was virtue, his greatness theology, his course the perpetual
   motion reaching even to God by its ascents, and his power the sowing
   and distribution of the Word.  So that I will not hesitate to say even
   this, his utterance went out into all lands, [4520] and the power of
   his words to the ends of the world:  as S. Paul says of the Apostles,
   [4521] borrowing the words from David.  What other charm is there in
   any gathering to-day?  What pleasure in banquets, in the courts, in the
   churches?  What delight in those in authority, and those beneath them?
   What in the hermits, or the cenobites?  What in the leisured classes,
   or those busied in affairs?  What in profane schools of philosophy or
   in our own?  There is one, which runs through all, and is the
   greatest--his writings and labours.  Nor do writers require any supply
   of matter besides his teaching or writings.  All the laborious studies
   of old days in the Divine oracles are silent, while the new ones are in
   everybody's mouth, and he is the best teacher among us who has the
   deepest acquaintance with his works, and speaks of them and explains
   them in our ears.  For he alone more than supplies the place of all
   others to those who are specially eager for instruction.

   67.  I will only say this of him.  Whenever I handle his Hexaemeron,
   and take its words on my lips, I am brought into the presence of the
   Creator, and understand the words of creation, and admire the Creator
   more than before, using my teacher as my only means of sight.  Whenever
   I take up his polemical works, I see the fire of Sodom, [4522] by which
   the wicked and rebellious tongues are reduced to ashes, or the tower of
   Chalane, [4523] impiously built, [4524] and righteously destroyed.
   Whenever I read his writings on the Spirit, I find the God Whom I
   possess, and grow bold in my utterance of the truth, from the support
   of his theology and contemplation.  His other treatises, in which he
   gives explanations for those who are shortsighted, by a threefold
   inscription on the solid tablets of his heart, lead me on from a mere
   literal or symbolical interpretation to a still wider view, as I
   proceed from one depth to another, calling upon deep [4525] after deep,
   and finding light after light, until I attain the highest pinnacle.
   When I study his panegyrics on our athletes, I despise the body, and
   enjoy the society of those whom he is praising, and rouse myself to the
   struggle.  His moral and practical discourses purify soul and body,
   making me a temple fit for God, and an instrument struck by the Spirit,
   to celebrate by its strains the glory and power of God.  In fact, he
   reduces me to harmony and order, and changes me by a Divine
   transformation.

   68.  Since I have mentioned theology, and his most sublime treatises in
   this science, I will make this addition to what I have already said.
   For it is of great service to the community, to save them from being
   injured by an unjustifiably low opinion of him.  My remarks are
   directed against those evil disposed persons who shelter their own
   vices under cover of their calumnies against others.  In his defence of
   orthodox teaching, and of the union and coequal divinity of the Holy
   Trinity, to use terms which are, I think, as exact and clear as
   possible, he would have eagerly welcomed as a gain, and not a danger,
   not only expulsion from his see, in which he had originally no desire
   to be enthroned, but even exile, and death, and its preliminary
   tortures.  This is manifest from his actual conduct and sufferings.
   For when he had been sentenced to banishment on behalf of the truth,
   the only notice which he took of it was, to bid one of his servants to
   take his writing tablet and follow him.  He held it necessary,
   according to the divine David's advice, to guide his words with
   discretion, [4526] and to endure for a while the time of war, and the
   ascendency of the heretics, until it should be succeeded by a time of
   freedom and calm, which would admit of freedom of speech.  The enemy
   were on the watch for the unqualified statement "the Spirit is God;"
   which, although it is true, they and the wicked patron of their impiety
   imagined to be impious; so that they might banish him and his power of
   theological instruction from the city, and themselves be able to seize
   upon the church, and make it the starting point and citadel, from which
   they could overrun with their evil doctrine the rest of the world.
   Accordingly, by the use of other terms, and by statements which
   unmistakably had the same meaning, and by arguments necessarily leading
   to this conclusion, he so overpowered his antagonists, that they were
   left without reply, and involved in their own admissions,--the greatest
   proof possible of dialectical power and skill.  His treatise on this
   subject makes it further manifest, being evidently written by a pen
   borrowed from the Spirit's store.  He postponed for the time the use of
   the exact term, begging as a favour from the Spirit Himself and his
   earnest champions, that they would not be annoyed at his economy,
   [4527] nor, by clinging to a single expression, ruin the whole cause,
   from an uncompromising temper, at a crisis when religion was in peril.
   He assured them that they would suffer no injury from a slight change
   in their expressions, and from teaching the same truth in other terms.
   For our salvation is not so much a matter of words as of actions; for
   we would not reject the Jews, if they desired to unite with us, and yet
   for a while sought to use the term "Anointed" instead of "Christ:"
   while the community would suffer a very serious injury, if the church
   were seized upon by the heretics.

   69.  That he, no less than any other, acknowledged that the Spirit is
   God, is plain from his often having publicly preached this truth,
   whenever opportunity offered, and eagerly confessed it when questioned
   in private.  But he made it more clear in his conversations with me,
   from whom he concealed nothing during our conferences upon this
   subject.  Not content with simply asserting it, he proceeded, as he had
   but very seldom done before, to imprecate upon himself that most
   terrible fate of separation from the Spirit, if he did not adore the
   Spirit as consubstantial and coequal with the Father and the Son.  And
   if any one would accept me as having been his fellow labourer in this
   cause, I will set forth one point hitherto unknown to most men.  Under
   the pressure of the difficulties of the period, he himself undertook
   the economy, while allowing freedom of speech to me, whom no one was
   likely to drag from obscurity to trial or banishment, in order that by
   our united efforts our Gospel might be firmly established.  I mention
   this, not to defend his reputation, for the man is stronger than his
   assailants, if there are any such; but to prevent men from thinking
   that the terms found in his writings are the utmost limit of the truth,
   and so have their faith weakened, and consider that their own error is
   supported by his theology, which was the joint result of the influences
   of the time and of the Spirit, instead of considering the sense of his
   writings, and the object with which they were written, so as to be
   brought closer to the truth, and enabled to silence the partisans of
   impiety.  At any rate let his theology be mine, and that of all dear to
   me!  And so confident am I of his spotlessness in this respect, that I
   take him for my partner in this, as in all else:  and may what is mine
   be attributed to him, what is his to me, both at the hands of God, and
   of the wisest of men!  For we would not say that the Evangelists are at
   variance with one another, because some are more occupied with the
   human side of the Christ, and others pay attention to His Divinity;
   some having commenced their history with what is within our own
   experience, others with what is above us; and by thus sharing the
   substance of their message, they have procured the advantage of those
   who receive it, and followed the impressions of the Spirit Who was
   within them.

   70.  Come then, there have been many men of old days illustrious for
   piety, as lawgivers, generals, prophets, teachers, and men brave to the
   shedding of blood.  Let us compare our prelate with them, and thus
   recognize his merit.  Adam was honoured by the hand of God, [4528] and
   the delights of Paradise, [4529] and the first legislation: [4530]
   but, unless I slander the reputation of our first parent, he kept not
   the command.  Now Basil both received and observed it, and received no
   injury from the tree of knowledge, and escaped the flaming sword, and,
   as I am well assured, has attained to Paradise.  Enos first ventured to
   call upon the Lord. [4531]   Basil both called upon Him himself, and,
   what is far more excellent, preached Him to others.  Enoch was
   translated, [4532] attaining to his translation as the reward of a
   little piety (for the faith was still in shadow) and escaped the peril
   of the remainder of life, but Basil's whole life was a translation, and
   he was completely tested in a complete life.  Noah was entrusted with
   the ark, [4533] and the seeds of a new world committed to a small house
   of wood, in their preservation from the waters.  Basil escaped the
   deluge of impiety and made of his own city an ark of safety, which
   sailed lightly over the heretics, and afterwards recovered the whole
   world.

   71.  Abraham was a great man, a patriarch, the offerer of the new
   sacrifice, [4534] by presenting to Him who had given it the promised
   seed, as a ready offering, eager for slaughter.  But Basil's offering
   was no slight one, when he offered himself to God, without any
   equivalent being given in his stead, (for how could that have been
   possible?) so that his sacrifice was consummated.  Isaac was promised
   even before his birth, [4535] Basil promised himself, and took for his
   spouse Rebekah, I mean the Church, not fetched from a distance by the
   mission of a servant, [4536] but bestowed upon and entrusted to him by
   God close at home:  nor was he outwitted in the preference of his
   children, but bestowed upon each what was due to him, without any
   deception, according to the judgment of the Spirit.  I extol the ladder
   of Jacob, [4537] and the pillar which he anointed to God, and his
   wrestling with Him, whatever it was; and, in my opinion, it was the
   contrast and opposition of the human stature to the height of God,
   resulting in the tokens of the defeat [4538] of his race.  I extol also
   his clever devices and success in cattle-breeding, and his children,
   the twelve Patriarchs, and the distribution of his blessings, with
   their glorious prophecy of the future.  But I still more extol Basil
   for the ladder which he did not merely see, but which he ascended by
   successive steps towards excellence, and the pillar which he did not
   anoint, but which he erected to God, by pillorying the teaching of the
   ungodly; and the wrestling with which he wrestled, not with God, but,
   on behalf of God, to the overthrow of the heretics; and his pastoral
   care, whereby he grew rich, through gaining for himself a number of
   marked sheep greater than that of the unmarked, and his illustrious
   fruitfulness in spiritual children, and the blessing with which he
   established many.

   72.  Joseph was a provider of corn, [4539] but in Egypt only, and not
   frequently, and of bodily food.  Basil did so for all men, and at all
   times, and in spiritual food, and therefore, in my opinion, his was the
   more honourable function.  Like Job, the man of Uz, [4540] he was both
   tempted, and overcame, and at the close of his struggles gained
   splendid honour, having been shaken by none of his many assailants, and
   having gained a decisive victory over the efforts of the tempter, and
   put to silence the unreason of his friends, who knew not the mysterious
   character of his affliction.  "Moses and Aaron among His priests."
   [4541]   Truly was Moses great, who inflicted the plagues upon Egypt,
   [4542] and delivered the people among many signs and wonders, and
   entered within the cloud, and sanctioned the double law, outward in the
   letter, and inward in the Spirit.  Aaron was Moses' brother, [4543]
   both naturally and spiritually, and offered sacrifices and prayers for
   the people, as the hierophant of the great and holy tabernacle, which
   the Lord pitched, and not man. [4544]   Of both of them Basil was a
   rival, for he tortured, not with bodily but with spiritual and mental
   plagues, the Egyptian race of heretics, and led to the land of promise
   [4545] the people of possession, zealous of good works; [4546] he
   inscribed laws, which are no longer obscure, but entirely spiritual, on
   tables [4547] which are not broken but are preserved; he entered the
   Holy of holies, [4548] not once a year, but often, I may say every day,
   and thence he revealed to us the Holy Trinity; and cleansed the people,
   not with temporary sprinklings, but with eternal purifications:  What
   is the special excellence of Joshua? [4549]   His generalship, and the
   distribution of the inheritance, and the taking possession of the Holy
   Land.  And was not Basil an Exarch? [4550]   Was he not a general of
   those who are saved by faith? [4551]   Did he not assign the different
   inheritances and abodes, according to the will of God, among his
   followers?  So that he too could use the words, "The lot is fallen unto
   me in pleasant places; [4552] and "my fortunes are in Thy hands,"
   [4553] fortunes more precious than those which come to us on earth, and
   can be snatched away.

   73.  Further, to run over the Judges, or the most illustrious of the
   Judges, there is "Samuel among those that call upon His Name," [4554]
   who was given to God before his birth, [4555] and sanctified
   immediately after his birth, and the anointer with his horn of kings
   and priests. [4556]   But was not Basil as an infant consecrated to God
   from the womb, and offered with a coat [4557] at the altar, and was he
   not a seer of heavenly things, and anointed of the Lord, and the
   anointer of those who are perfected by the Spirit?  Among the kings,
   David is celebrated, whose victories and trophies [4558] gained from
   the enemy are on record, but his most characteristic trait was his
   gentleness, [4559] and, before his kingly office, his power with the
   harp, able to soothe even the evil spirit.  Solomon asked of God and
   obtained breadth of heart, [4560] making the furthest possible progress
   in wisdom and contemplation, so that he became the most famous man of
   his time.  Basil, in my opinion, was in no wise, or but little
   inferior, to the one in gentleness, to the other in wisdom, so that he
   soothed the arrogance of infuriated sovereigns; and did not merely
   bring the queen of the south from the ends of the earth, or any other
   individual, to visit him because of his renown for wisdom, but made his
   wisdom known in all the ends of the world.  I pass over the rest of
   Solomon's life.  Even if we spare it, it is evident to all.

   74.  Do you praise the courage of Elijah [4561] in the presence of
   tyrants, and his fiery translation? [4562]   Or the fair inheritance of
   Elisha, the sheepskin mantle, accompanied by the spirit of Elijah?
   [4563]   You must also praise the life of Basil, spent in the fire.  I
   mean in the multitude of temptations, and his escape through fire,
   which burnt, but did not consume, the mystery of "the bush," [4564] and
   the fair cloak of skin from on high, his indifference to the flesh.  I
   pass by the rest, the three young men bedewed in the fire, [4565] the
   fugitive prophet praying in the whale's belly, [4566] and coming forth
   from the creature, as from a chamber; the just man in the den,
   restraining the lions' rage, [4567] and the struggle of the seven
   Maccabees, [4568] who were perfected with their father and mother in
   blood, and in all kinds of tortures.  Their endurance he rivalled, and
   won their glory.

   75.  I now turn to the New Testament, and comparing his life with those
   who are here illustrious, I shall find in the teachers a source of
   honour for their disciple.  Who was the forerunner of Jesus? [4569]
   John, the voice of the Word, [4570] the lamp of the Light, [4571]
   before Whom he even leaped in the womb, [4572] and Whom he preceded to
   Hades, whither he was despatched by the rage of Herod, [4573] to herald
   even there Him who was coming.  And, if my language seems audacious to
   anyone, let me assure him beforehand, that in making this comparison, I
   neither prefer Basil, nor imply that he is equal to him who surpasses
   all who are born of women, [4574] but only show that he was stirred to
   emulation, and possessed to some extent his striking features.  For it
   is no slight thing for the earnest to imitate the greatest of men, even
   in a slight degree.  Is it not indeed manifest that Basil was a copy of
   John's asceticism?  He also lived in the wilderness, and wore in
   nightly watchings a ragged garb, during his shrinking retirement; he
   also loved a similar food, purifying himself for God by abstinence; he
   also was thought worthy to be a herald, if not a forerunner, of Christ,
   and there went out to him not only all the region round about, [4575]
   but also that which was beyond its borders; he also stood between the
   two covenants, abolishing the letter of the one by administering the
   spirit of the other, and bringing about the fulfilment of the hidden
   law through the dissolution of that which was apparent.

   76.  He emulated the zeal of Peter, [4576] the intensity of Paul, the
   faith of both these men of name and of surname, the lofty utterance of
   the sons of Zebedee, the frugality and simplicity of all the
   disciples.  Therefore he was also entrusted with the keys of the
   heavens, [4577] and not only from Jerusalem and round about unto
   Illyricum, [4578] but he embraces a wider circle in the Gospel; he is
   not named, but becomes, a Son of thunder; and lying upon the breast of
   Jesus, he draws thence the power of his word, and the depth of his
   thoughts.  He was prevented from becoming a Stephen, [4579] eager
   though he was, since reverence stayed the hands of those who would have
   stoned him.  I am able to sum up still more concisely, to avoid
   treating in detail on these points of each individual.  In some
   respects he discovered, in some he emulated, in others he surpassed the
   good.  In his many-sided virtues he excelled all men of this day.  I
   have but one thing left to say, and in few words.

   77.  So great was his virtue, and the eminence of his fame, that many
   of his minor characteristics, nay, even his physical defects, have been
   assumed by others with a view to notoriety.  For instance his paleness,
   his beard, his gait, his thoughtful, and generally meditative,
   hesitation in speaking, which, in the ill-judged, inconsiderate
   imitation of many, took the form of melancholy.  And besides, the style
   of his dress, the shape of his bed, and his manner of eating, none of
   which was to him a matter of consequence, but simply the result of
   accident and chance.  So you might see many Basils in outward
   semblance, among these statues in outline, for it would be too much to
   call them his distant echo.  For an echo, though it is the dying away
   of a sound, at any rate represents it with great clearness, while these
   men fall too far short of him to satisfy even their desire to approach
   him.  Nor was it a slight thing, but a matter with good reason held in
   the highest estimation, to chance to have met him or done him some
   service, or to carry away the souvenir of something which he had said
   or done in jest or in earnest:  as I know that I have myself often
   taken pride in doing; for his improvisations were much more precious
   and brilliant than the laboured efforts of other men.

   78.  But when, after he had finished his course, and kept the faith,
   [4580] he longed to depart, and the time for his crown was approaching,
   [4581] he did not hear the summons:  "Get thee up into the mountain and
   die," [4582] but "Die and come up to us."  And here again he wrought a
   wonder in no wise inferior to those mentioned before.  For when he was
   almost dead, and breathless, and had lost the greater part of his
   powers; he grew stronger in his last words, so as to depart with the
   utterances of religion, and, by ordaining the most excellent of his
   attendants, bestowed upon them both his hand and the Spirit:  so that
   his disciples, who had aided him in his priestly office, might not be
   defrauded of the priesthood.  The remainder of my task I approach, but
   with reluctance, as it would fall more fully from the mouths of others
   than from my own.  For I cannot philosophise over my misfortune, even
   if I greatly longed to do so, when I recollect that the loss is common
   to us all, and that the misfortune has befallen the whole world.

   79.  He lay, drawing his last breath, and awaited by the choir on high,
   towards which he had long directed his gaze.  Around him poured the
   whole city, unable to bear his loss, inveighing against his departure,
   as if it had been an oppression, and clinging to his soul, as though it
   had been capable of restraint or compulsion at their hands or their
   prayers.  Their suffering had driven them distracted, all were eager,
   were it possible, to add to his life a portion of their own.  And when
   they failed, for it must needs be proved that he was a man, and, with
   his last words "Into thy Hands I commend my spirit," [4583] he had
   joyfully resigned his soul to the care of the angels who carried him
   away; not without having some religious instructions and injunctions
   for the benefit of those who were present--then occurred a wonder more
   remarkable than any which had happened before.

   80.  The saint was being carried out, lifted high by the hands of holy
   men, and everyone was eager, some to seize the hem of his garment,
   [4584] others only just to touch the shadow, [4585] or the bier which
   bore his holy remains (for what could be more holy or pure than that
   body), others to draw near to those who were carrying it, others only
   to enjoy the sight, as if even this were beneficial.  Market places,
   porticos, houses of two or three stories were filled with people
   escorting, preceding, following, accompanying him, and trampling upon
   each other; tens of thousands of every race and age, beyond all
   previous experience.  The psalmody was overborne by the lamentations,
   philosophic resignation sank beneath the misfortune.  Our own people
   vied with strangers, Jews, Greeks, and foreigners, and they with us,
   for a greater share in the benefit, by means of a more abundant
   lamentation.  To close my story, the calamity ended in danger; many
   souls departed along with him, from the violence of the pushing and
   confusion, who have been thought happy in their end, departing together
   with him, "funeral victims," perhaps some fervid orator might call
   them.  The body having at last escaped from those who would seize it,
   and made its way through those who went before it, was consigned to the
   tomb of his fathers, the high priest being added to the priests, the
   mighty voice which rings in my ears to the heralds, the martyr to the
   martyrs.  And now he is in heaven, where, if I mistake not, he is
   offering sacrifices for us, and praying for the people, for though, he
   has left us, he has not entirely left us.  While I, Gregory, who am
   half dead, and, cleft in twain, torn away from our great union, and
   dragging along a life of pain which runs not easily, as may be
   supposed, after separation from him, know not what is to be my end now
   that I have lost my guidance.  And even now I am admonished and
   instructed in nightly visions, if ever I fall short of my duty.  And my
   present object is not so much to mingle lamentations with my praises,
   or to portray the public life of the man, or publish a picture of
   virtue common to all time, and an example salutary to all churches, and
   to all souls, which we may keep in view, as a living law, and so
   rightly direct our lives as to counsel you, who have been completely
   initiated into his doctrine, to fix your eyes upon him, as one who sees
   you and is seen by you, and thus to be perfected by the Spirit.

   81.  Come hither then, and surround me, all ye members of his choir,
   both of the clergy and the laity, both of our own country and from
   abroad; aid me in my eulogy, by each supplying or demanding the account
   of some of his excellences.  Regard, ye occupants of the bench, the
   lawgiver; ye politicians, the statesman; ye men of the people, his
   orderliness; ye men of letters, the instructor; ye virgins, the leader
   of the bride; ye who are yoked in marriage, the restrainer; ye hermits,
   him who gave you wings; ye cenobites, the judge; ye simple men, the
   guide; ye contemplatives, the divine; ye cheerful ones, the bridle; ye
   unfortunate men, the consoler, the staff of hoar hairs, the guide of
   youth, the relief of poverty, the steward of abundance.  Widows also
   will, I imagine, praise their protector, orphans their father, poor men
   their friend, strangers their entertainer, brothers the man of
   brotherly love, the sick their physician, whatever be their sickness
   and the healing they need, the healthy the preserver of health, and all
   men him who made himself all things to all that he might gain the
   majority, if not all.

   82.  This is my offering to thee, Basil, uttered by the tongue which
   once was the sweetest of all to thee, of him who was thy fellow in age
   and rank.  If it have approached thy deserts, thanks are due to thee,
   for it was from confidence in thee that I undertook to speak of thee.
   But if it fall far short of thy expectations, what must be our
   feelings, who are worn out with age and disease and regret for thee?
   Yet God is pleased, when we do what we can.  Yet mayest thou gaze upon
   us from above, thou divine and sacred person; either stay by thy
   entreaties our thorn in the flesh, [4586] given to us by God for our
   discipline, or prevail upon us to bear it boldly, and guide all our
   life towards that which is most for our profit.  And if we be
   translated, do thou receive us there also in thine own tabernacle,
   that, as we dwell together, and gaze together more clearly and more
   perfectly upon the holy and blessed Trinity, of Which we have now in
   some degree received the image, our longing may at last be satisfied,
   by gaining this recompense for all the battles we have fought and the
   assaults we have endured.  Such are our words on thy behalf:  who will
   there be to praise us, since we leave this life after thee, even if we
   offer any topic worthy of words or praise in Christ Jesus our Lord, to
   Whom be glory forever?  Amen.

   Oration XLV.

   The Second Oration on Easter.

   ThisOration was not, as its title would perhaps lead us to suppose,
   delivered immediately after the first; but an interval of many years
   elapsed between them, and the two have no connection with each other.
   Chronologically they are the first and last of S. Gregory's Sermons.
   The Second was delivered in the Church of Arianzus, a village near
   Nazianzus, where he had inherited some property, to which he withdrew
   after resigning the Archbishopric of Constantinople, and then, finding
   the administration even of the little Bishopric of Nazianzus too much
   for his advancing years and declining strength, he retired to Arianzus
   about the end of a.d. 383, dying there in 389 or 390.  "The exordium of
   this discourse is quite in the style of the Bible; the Orator here
   describes and puts words into the mouth of the Angel of the
   Resurrection.  His object is to show the importance of the day's
   solemnities, and to explain allegorically all the circumstances of the
   ancient Passover, applying them to Christ and the Christian life.  Two
   passages are borrowed verbatim from the discourse on the Nativity,
   preached at Constantinople" (Benoît).

   The Benedictine Editors profess themselves unable to determine whether
   this repetition is due to S. Gregory himself--or to the carelessness of
   some amanuensis.

   I.  I will stand upon my watch, [4587] saith the venerable Habakkuk;
   and I will take my post beside him today on the authority and
   observation which was given me of the Spirit; and I will look forth,
   and will observe what shall be said to me.  Well, I have taken my
   stand, and looked forth; and behold a man riding on the clouds and he
   is very high, and his countenance is as the countenance of Angel,
   [4588] and his vesture as the brightness of piercing lightning; and he
   lifts his hand toward the East, and cries with a loud voice.  His voice
   is like the voice of a trumpet; and round about Him is as it were a
   multitude of the Heavenly Host; and he saith, Today is salvation come
   unto the world, to that which is visible, and to that which is
   invisible.  Christ is risen from the dead, rise ye with Him.  Christ is
   returned again to Himself, return ye.  Christ is freed from the tomb,
   be ye freed from the bond of sin.  The gates of hell are opened, and
   death is destroyed, and the old Adam is put aside, and the New is
   fulfilled; if any man be in Christ he is a new creature; [4589] be ye
   renewed.  Thus he speaks; and the rest sing out, as they did before
   when Christ was manifested to us by His birth on earth, their glory to
   God in the highest, on earth, peace, goodwill among men. [4590]   And
   with them I also utter the same words among you.  And would that I
   might receive a voice that should rank with the Angel's, and should
   sound through all the ends of the earth.

   II.  The Lord's Passover, the Passover, and again I say the Passover to
   the honour of the Trinity.  This is to us a Feast of feasts and a
   Solemnity of solemnities [4591] as far exalted above all others (not
   only those which are merely human and creep on the ground, but even
   those which are of Christ Himself, and are celebrated in His honour) as
   the Sun is above the stars.  Beautiful indeed yesterday was our
   splendid array, and our illumination, in which both in public and
   private we associated ourselves, every kind of men, and almost every
   rank, illuminating the night with our crowded fires, formed after the
   fashion of that great light, both that with which the heaven above us
   lights its beacon fires, and that which is above the heavens, amid the
   angels (the first luminous nature, next to the first nature of all,
   because springing directly from it), and that which is in the Trinity,
   from which all light derives its being, parted from the undivided light
   and honoured.  But today's is more beautiful and more illustrious;
   inasmuch as yesterday's light was a forerunner of the rising of the
   Great Light, and as it were a kind of rejoicing in preparation for the
   Festival; but today we are celebrating the Resurrection itself, no
   longer as an object of expectation, but as having already come to pass,
   and gathering the whole world unto itself.  Let then different persons
   bring forth different fruits and offer different offerings at this
   season, smaller or greater...such spiritual offerings as are dear to
   God...as each may have power.  For scarcely Angels themselves could
   offer gifts worthy of its rank, those first and intellectual and pure
   beings, who are also eye-witnesses of the Glory That is on high; if
   even these can attain the full strain of praise.  We will for our part
   offer a discourse, the best and most precious thing we have--especially
   as we are praising the Word for the blessing which He hath bestowed on
   the reasoning creation.  I will begin from this point.  For I cannot
   endure, when I am engaged in offering the sacrifice of the lips
   concerning the Great Sacrifice and the greatest of days, to fail to
   recur to God, and to take my beginning from Him.  Therefore I pray you,
   cleanse your mind and ears and thoughts, all you who delight in such
   subjects, since the discourse will be concerning God, and will be
   divine; that you may depart filled with delights of a sort that do not
   pass away into nothingness.  And it shall be at once very full and very
   concise, so as neither to distress you by its deficiencies, nor to
   displease you by satiety.

   III.  God [4592] always was and always is, and always will be; or
   rather, God always Is. [4593]   For Was and Will Be are fragments of
   our time, and of changeable nature.  But He is Eternal Being; and this
   is the Name He gives Himself when giving the Oracles to Moses in the
   Mount.  For in Himself He sums up and contains all Being, having
   neither beginning in the past nor end in the future...like some great
   Sea of Being, limitless and unbounded, transcending all conception of
   time and nature, only adumbrated by the mind, and that very dimly and
   scantily...not by His Essentials but by His Environment, [4594] one
   image being got from one source and another from another, and combined
   into some sort of presentation of the truth, which escapes us before we
   have caught it, and which takes to flight before we have conceived it,
   blazing forth upon our master-part, even when that is cleansed, as the
   lightning flash which will not stay its course does upon our sight...in
   order, as I conceive, by that part of it which we can comprehend to
   draw us to itself (for that which is altogether incomprehensible is
   outside the bounds of hope, and not within the compass of endeavour);
   and by that part of It which we cannot comprehend to move our wonder;
   and as an object of wonder to become more an object of desire; and
   being desired, to purify; and purifying to make us like God; so that,
   when we have become like Himself, God may, to use a bold expression,
   hold converse with us as God; being united to us, and known by us; and
   that perhaps to the same extent as He already knows those who are known
   to Him. [4595]   The Divine Nature, then, is boundless and hard to
   understand, and all that we can comprehend of Him is His boundlessness;
   even though one may conceive that because He is of a simple Nature He
   is therefore either wholly incomprehensible or perfectly
   comprehensible.  For let us farther enquire what is implied by "is of a
   simple Nature?"  For it is quite certain that this simplicity is not
   itself its nature, just as composition is not by itself the essence of
   compound beings.

   IV.  And when Infinity is considered from two points of view, beginning
   and end (for that which is beyond these and not limited by them is
   Infinity), when the mind looks into the depths above, not having where
   to stand, and leans upon phænomena to form an idea of God it calls the
   Infinite and Unapproachable which it finds there by the name of
   Unoriginate.  And when it looks into the depth below and at the future,
   it calls Him Undying and Imperishable.  And when it draws a conclusion
   from the whole, it calls Him Eternal.  For Eternity is neither time nor
   part of time; for it cannot be measured.  But what time measured by the
   course of the sun is to us, that Eternity is to the Everlasting; namely
   a sort of timelike movement and interval, coextensive with Their
   Existence.  This however is all that I must now say of God; for the
   present is not a suitable time, as my present subject is not the
   doctrine of God, but that of the Incarnation.  And when I say God, I
   mean Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; for Godhead is neither diffused
   beyond These, so as to introduce a mob of gods, nor yet bounded by a
   smaller compass than These, so as to condemn us for a poverty stricken
   conception of Deity, either Judaizing to save the Monarchia, or falling
   into heathenism by the multitude of our gods.  For the evil on either
   side is the same, though found in contrary directions.  Thus then is
   the Holy of Holies, Which is hidden even from the Seraphim, and is
   glorified with a thrice-repeated Holy meeting in one ascription of the
   title Lord and God, as one of our predecessors has most beautifully and
   loftily reasoned out.

   V.  But since this movement of Self-contemplation alone could not
   satisfy Goodness, but Good must be poured out and go forth beyond
   Itself, to multiply the objects of Its beneficence (for this was
   essential to the highest Goodness), He first conceived the Angelic and
   Heavenly Powers.  And this conception was a work fulfilled by His Word
   and perfected by His Spirit.  And so the Secondary Splendours came into
   being, as the ministers of the Primary Splendour (whether we are to
   conceive of them as intelligent Spirits, or as Fire of an immaterial
   and incorporeal kind, or as some other nature approaching this as near
   as may be).  I should like to say that they are incapable of movement
   in the direction of evil, and susceptible only of the movement of good,
   as being about God and illuminated with the first Rays from God (for
   earthly beings have but the second illumination), but I am obliged to
   stop short of saying that they are immovable, and to conceive and speak
   of them as only difficult to move, because of him who for His Splendour
   was called Lucifer, but became and is called Darkness through his
   pride; and the Apostate Hosts who are subject to him, creators of evil
   by their revolt against good, and our inciters.

   VI.  Thus then and for these reasons, He gave being to the world of
   thought, as far as I can reason on these matters, and estimate great
   things in my own poor language.  Then, when His first Creation was in
   good order, He conceives a second world, material and visible; and this
   a system of earth and sky and all that is in the midst of them; an
   admirable creation indeed when we look at the fair form of every part,
   but yet more worthy of admiration when we consider the harmony and
   unison of the whole, and how each part fits in with every other in fair
   order, and all with the whole, tending to the perfect completion of the
   world as a Unit.  This was to shew that He could call into being not
   only a nature akin to Himself, but also one altogether alien to Him.
   For akin to Deity are those natures which are intellectual, and only to
   be comprehended by mind; but all of which sense can take cognizance are
   utterly alien to It; and of these the furthest removed from it are all
   those which are entirely destitute of soul and power of motion.

   VII.  Mind then and sense, thus distinguished from each other, had
   remained within their own boundaries, and bore in themselves the
   magnificence of the Creator-Word, silent praisers and thrilling heralds
   of His mighty work.  Not yet was there any mingling of both, nor any
   mixture of these opposites, tokens of a greater wisdom and generosity
   in the creation of natures; nor as yet were the whole riches of
   goodness made known.  Now the Creator-Word, determining to exhibit
   this, and to produce a single living being out of both (the invisible
   and the visible creation, I mean) fashions Man; and taking a body from
   already existing matter, and placing in it a Breath taken from Himself
   (which the Word knew to be an intelligent soul, and the image of God),
   as a sort of second world, great in littleness, He placed him on the
   earth, a new Angel, a mingled worshipper, fully initiated into the
   visible creation, but only partially into the intellectual; king of all
   upon earth, but subject to the King above; earthly and heavenly;
   temporal and yet immortal; visible and yet intellectual; halfway
   between greatness and lowliness; in one person combining spirit and
   flesh; spirit because of the favour bestowed on him, flesh on account
   of the height to which he had been raised; the one that he might
   continue to live and glorify his benefactor, the other that he might
   suffer, and by suffering be put in remembrance, and be corrected if he
   became proud in his greatness; a living creature, trained here and then
   moved elsewhere; and to complete the mystery, deified by its
   inclination to God...for to this, I think, tends that light of Truth
   which here we possess but in measure; that we should both see and
   experience the Splendour of God, which is worthy of Him Who made us,
   and will dissolve us, and remake us after a loftier fashion.

   VIII.  This being He placed in paradise--whatever that paradise may
   have been (having honoured him with the gift of free will, in order
   that good might belong to him as the result of his choice, no less than
   to Him Who had implanted the seeds of it)--to till the immortal plants,
   by which is perhaps meant the Divine conceptions, both the simpler and
   the more perfect; naked in his simplicity and inartificial life; and
   without any covering or screen; for it was fitting that he who was from
   the beginning should be such.  And He gave Him a Law, as material for
   his free will to act upon.  This Law was a commandment as to what
   plants he might partake of, and which one he might not touch.  This
   latter was the Tree of Knowledge; not, however, because it was evil
   from the beginning when planted; nor was it forbidden because God
   grudged it to men--let not the enemies of God wag their tongues in that
   direction, or imitate the serpent.  But it would have been good if
   partaken of at the proper time; for the Tree was, according to my
   theory, Contemplation, which it is only safe for those who have reached
   maturity of habit to enter upon; but which is not good for those who
   are still somewhat simple and greedy; just as neither is solid food
   good for those who are yet tender and have need of milk.  But when
   through the devil's malice and the woman's caprice, [4596] to which she
   succumbed as the more tender, and which she brought to bear upon the
   man, as she was the more apt to persuade--alas for my weakness, for
   that of my first father was mine; he forgot the commandment which had
   been given him, and yielded to the baleful fruit; and for his sin was
   banished at once from the tree of life, and from paradise, and from
   God; and put on the coats of skins, that is, perhaps, the coarser
   flesh, both mortal and contradictory.  And this was the first thing
   which he learnt--his own shame--and he hid himself from God.  Yet here
   too he makes a gain, namely death and the cutting off of sin, in order
   that evil may not be immortal.  Thus, his punishment is changed into a
   mercy, for it is in mercy, I am persuaded, that God inflicts
   punishment.

   IX.  And having first been chastened by many means because his sins
   were many, whose root of evil sprang up through divers causes and
   sundry times, by word, by law, by prophets, by benefits, by threats, by
   plagues, by waters, by fires, by wars, by victories, by defeats, by
   signs in heaven, and signs in the air, and in the earth, and in the
   sea; by unexpected changes of men, of cities, of nations (the object of
   which was the destruction of wickedness) at last he needed a stronger
   remedy, for his diseases were growing worse; mutual slaughters,
   adulteries, perjuries, unnatural crimes, and that first and last of all
   evils, idolatry, and the transfer of worship from the Creator to the
   creatures.  As these required a greater aid, so they also obtained a
   greater.  And that was that the Word of God Himself, Who is before all
   worlds, the Invisible, the Incomprehensible, the Bodiless, the
   Beginning of beginning, the Light of Light, the Source of Life and
   Immortality, the Image of the Archetype, the Immovable Seal, the
   Unchangeable Image, the Father's Definition and Word, came to His own
   Image, and took on Him Flesh for the sake of our flesh, and mingled
   Himself with an intelligent soul for my soul's sake, purifying like by
   like; and in all points except sin was made Man; conceived by the
   Virgin, who first in body and soul was purified by the Holy Ghost, for
   it was needful both That Child-bearing should be honoured and that
   Virginity should receive a higher honour.  He came forth then, as God,
   with That which He had assumed; one Person in two natures, flesh and
   Spirit, of which the latter deified the former.  O new commingling; O
   strange conjunction! the Self-existent comes into Being, the Uncreated
   is created, That which cannot be contained is contained by the
   intervention of an intellectual soul mediating between the Deity and
   the corporeity of the flesh.  And He who gives riches becomes poor; for
   He assumes the poverty of my flesh, that I may assume the riches of His
   Godhead.  He that is full empties Himself; for He empties Himself of
   His Glory for a short while, that I may have a share in His Fulness.
   What is the riches of His Goodness?  What is this mystery that is
   around me?  I had a share in the Image and I did not keep it; He
   partakes of my flesh that He may both save the Image and make the flesh
   immortal.  He communicates a Second Communion, far more marvellous than
   the first, inasmuch as then He imparted the better nature, but now He
   Himself assumes the worse.  This is more godlike than the former
   action; this is loftier in the eyes of all men of understanding.

   X.  But perhaps some one of those who are too impetuous and festive may
   say, "What has all this to do with us?  Spur on your horse to the goal;
   talk to us about the Festival and the reasons for our being here
   to-day."  Yes, this is what I am about to do, although I have begun at
   a somewhat previous point, being compelled to do so by the needs of my
   argument.  There will be no harm in the eyes of scholars and lovers of
   the beautiful if we say a few words about the word Pascha itself, for
   such an addition will not be useless in their ears.  This great and
   venerable Pascha is called Phaska by the Hebrews in their own language;
   and the word means Passing Over.  Historically, from their flight and
   migration from Egypt into the Land of Canaan; spiritually, from the
   progress and ascent from things below to things above and to the Land
   of Promise.  And we observe that a thing which we often find to have
   happened in Scripture, the change of certain nouns from an uncertain to
   a clearer sense, or from a coarser to a more refined, has taken place
   in this instance.  For some people, supposing this to be a name of the
   Sacred Passion, and in consequence Grecizing the word by changing Phi
   and Kappa into Pi and Chi, called the Day Pascha. [4597]   And custom
   took it up and confirmed the word, with the help of the ears of most
   people, to whom it had a more pious sound.

   XI.  But before our time the Holy Apostle declared that the Law was but
   a shadow of things to come, [4598] which are conceived by thought.  And
   God too, who in still older times gave oracles to Moses, said when
   giving laws concerning these things, See thou make all things according
   to the pattern shewed thee in the Mount, [4599] when He shewed him the
   visible things as an adumbration of and design for the things that are
   invisible.  And I am persuaded that none of these things has been
   ordered in vain, none without a reason, none in a grovelling manner or
   unworthy of the legislation of God and the ministry of Moses, even
   though it be difficult in each type to find a theory descending to the
   most delicate details, to every point about the Tabernacle itself, and
   its measures and materials, and the Levites and Priests who carried
   them, and all the particulars which were enacted about the Sacrifices
   and the purifications and the Offerings; [4600] and though these are
   only to be understood by those who rank with Moses in virtue, or have
   made the nearest approach to his learning.  For in that Mount itself
   God is seen by men; on the one hand through His own descent from His
   lofty abode, on the other through His drawing us up from our abasement
   on earth, that the Incomprehensible may be in some degree, and as far
   as is safe, comprehended by a mortal nature.  For in no other way is it
   possible for the denseness of a material body and an imprisoned mind to
   come into consciousness of God, except by His assistance.  Then
   therefore all men do not seem to have been deemed worthy of the same
   rank and position; but one of one place and one of another, each, I
   think, according to the measure of his own purification.  Some have
   even been altogether driven away, and only permitted to hear the Voice
   from on high, namely those whose dispositions are altogether like wild
   beasts, and who are unworthy of divine mysteries.

   XII.  But we, standing midway between those whose minds are utterly
   dense on the one side, and on the other those who are very
   contemplative and exalted, that we may neither remain quite idle and
   immovable, nor yet be more busy than we ought, and fall short of and be
   estranged from our purpose--for the former course is Jewish and very
   low, and the latter is only fit for the dream-soothsayer, and both
   alike are to be condemned--let us say our say upon these matters, so
   far as is within our reach, and not very absurd, or exposed to the
   ridicule of the multitude.  Our belief is that since it was needful
   that we, who had fallen in consequence of the original sin, and had
   been led away by pleasure, even as far as idolatry and unlawful
   bloodshed, should be recalled and raised up again to our original
   position through the tender mercy of God our Father, Who could not
   endure that such a noble work of His own hands as Man should be lost to
   Him; the method of our new creation, and of what should be done, was
   this:--that all violent remedies were disapproved, as not likely to
   persuade us, and as quite possibly tending to add to the plague,
   through our chronic pride; but that God disposed things to our
   restoration by a gentle and kindly method of cure.  For a crooked
   sapling will not bear a sudden bending the other way, or violence from
   the hand that would straighten it, but will be more quickly broken than
   straightened; and a horse of a hot temper and above a certain age will
   not endure the tyranny of the bit without some coaxing and
   encouragement.  Therefore the Law is given to us as an assistance, like
   a boundary wall between God and idols, drawing us away from one and to
   the Other.  And it concedes a little at first, that it may receive that
   which is greater.  It concedes the Sacrifices for a time, that it may
   establish God in us, and then when the fitting time shall come may
   abolish the Sacrifices also; thus wisely changing our minds by gradual
   removals, and bringing us over to the Gospel when we have already been
   trained to a prompt obedience.

   XIII.  Thus then and for this cause the written Law came in, gathering
   us into Christ; and this is the account of the Sacrifices as I account
   for them.  And that you may not be ignorant of the depth of His Wisdom
   and the riches of His unsearchable judgments, [4601] He did not leave
   even these unhallowed altogether, or useless, or with nothing in them
   but mere blood. [4602]   But that great, and if I may say so, in Its
   first nature unsacrificeable Victim, was intermingled with the
   Sacrifices of the Law, and was a purification, not for a part of the
   world, nor for a short time, but for the whole world and for all time.
   For this reason a Lamb was chosen for its innocence, and its clothing
   of the original nakedness.  For such is the Victim, That was offered
   for us, Who is both in Name and fact the Garment of incorruption.  And
   He was a perfect Victim not only on account of His Godhead, than which
   nothing is more perfect; but also on account of that which He assumed
   having been anointed with Deity, and having become one with That which
   anointed It, and I am bold to say, made equal with God.  A Male,
   because offered for Adam; or rather the Stronger for the strong, when
   the first Man had fallen under sin; and chiefly because there is in Him
   nothing feminine, nothing unmanly; but He burst from the bonds of the
   Virgin-Mother's womb with much power, and a Male was brought forth by
   the Prophetess, [4603] as Isaiah declares the good tidings.  And of a
   year old, because He is the Sun of Righteousness [4604] setting out
   from heaven, and circumscribed by His visible Nature, and returning
   unto Himself. [4605]   And "The blessed crown of Goodness,"--being on
   every side equal to Himself and alike; and not only this, but also as
   giving life to all the circle of the virtues, gently commingled and
   intermixed with each other, according to the Law of Love and Order.
   [4606]   And Immaculate and guileless, as being the Healer of faults,
   and of the defects and taints that come from sin.  For though He both
   took on Him our sins and bare our diseases, [4607] yet He did not
   Himself suffer aught that needed healing.  For He was tempted in all
   points like as we are yet without sin. [4608]   For he that persecuted
   the Light that shineth in darkness could not overtake Him.

   XIV.  What more?  The First Month is introduced, or rather the
   beginning of months, whether it was so among the Hebrews from the
   beginning, or was made so later on this account, and became the first
   in consequence of the Mystery; and the tenth of the Month, for this is
   the most complete number, of units the first perfect unit, and the
   parent of perfection.  And it is kept until the fifth day, perhaps
   because the Victim, of Whom I am speaking, purifies the five senses,
   from which comes falling into sin, and around which the war rages,
   inasmuch as they are open to the incitements to sin.  And it was
   chosen, not only out of the lambs, but also out of the inferior
   species, which are placed on the left hand [4609] --the kids; because
   He is sacrificed not only for the righteous, but also for sinners; and
   perhaps even more for these, inasmuch as we have greater need of His
   mercy.  And we need not be surprised that a lamb for a house should be
   required as the best course, but if that could not be, then one might
   be obtained by contributions (owing to poverty) for the houses of a
   family; because it is clearly best that each individual should suffice
   for his own perfecting, and should offer his own living sacrifice holy
   unto God Who called him, being consecrated at all times and in every
   respect.  But if that cannot be, then that those who are akin in virtue
   and of like disposition should be made use of as helpers.  For I think
   this provision means that we should communicate of the Sacrifice to
   those who are nearest, if there be need.

   XV.  Then comes the Sacred Night, the Anniversary of the confused
   darkness of the present life, into which the primæval darkness is
   dissolved, and all things come into life and rank and form, and that
   which was chaos is reduced to order.  Then we flee from Egypt, that is
   from sullen persecuting sin; and from Pharaoh the unseen tyrant, and
   the bitter taskmasters, changing our quarters to the world above; and
   are delivered from the clay and the brickmaking, and from the husks and
   dangers of this fleshly condition, which for most men is only not
   overpowered by mere husklike calculations.  Then the Lamb is slain, and
   act and word are sealed with the Precious Blood; that is, habit and
   action, the sideposts of our doors; I mean, of course, of the movements
   of mind and opinion, which are rightly opened and closed by
   contemplation, since there is a limit even to thoughts.  Then the last
   and gravest plague upon the persecutors, truly worthy of the night; and
   Egypt mourns the first-born of her own reasonings and actions which are
   also called in the Scripture the Seed of the Chaldeans [4610] removed,
   and the children of Babylon dashed against the rocks and destroyed;
   [4611] and the whole air is full of the cry and clamour of the
   Egyptians; and then the Destroyer of them shall withdraw from us in
   reverence of the Unction.  Then the removal of leaven; that is, of the
   old and sour wickedness, not of that which is quickening and makes
   bread; for seven days, a number which is of all the most mystical,
   [4612] and is co-ordinate with this present world, that we may not lay
   in provision of any Egyptian dough, or relic of Pharisaic or ungodly
   teaching.

   XVI.  Well, let them lament; we will feed on the Lamb toward
   evening--for Christ's Passion was in the completion of the ages;
   because too He communicated His Disciples in the evening with His
   Sacrament, destroying the darkness of sin; and not sodden, but
   roast--that our word may have in it nothing that is unconsidered or
   watery, or easily made away with; but may be entirely consistent and
   solid, and free from all that is impure and from all vanity.  And let
   us be aided by the good coals, [4613] kindling and purifying our minds
   from Him That cometh to send fire on the earth, [4614] that shall
   destroy all evil habits, and to hasten its kindling.  Whatsoever then
   there be, of solid and nourishing in the Word, shall be eaten with the
   inward parts and hidden things of the mind, and shall be consumed and
   given up to spiritual digestion; aye, from head to foot, that is, from
   the first contemplations of Godhead to the very last thoughts about the
   Incarnation.  Neither let us carry aught of it abroad, nor leave it
   till the morning; because most of our Mysteries may not be carried out
   to them that are outside, nor is there beyond this night any further
   purification; and procrastination is not creditable to those who have a
   share in the Word.  For just as it is good and well-pleasing to God not
   to let anger last through the day, [4615] but to get rid of it before
   sunset, whether you take this of time or in a mystical sense, for it is
   not safe for us that the Sun of Righteousness should go down upon our
   wrath; so too we ought not to let such Food remain all night, nor to
   put it off till to-morrow.  But whatever is of bony nature and not fit
   for food and hard for us even to understand, this must not be broken;
   that is, badly divined and misconceived (I need not say that in the
   history not a bone of Jesus was broken, even though His death was
   hastened by His crucifiers on account of the Sabbath); [4616] nor must
   it be stripped off and thrown away, lest that which is holy should be
   given to the dogs, [4617] that is, to the evil hearers of the Word;
   just as the glorious pearl of the Word is not to be cast before swine;
   but it shall be consumed with the fire with which the burnt offerings
   also are consumed, being refined and preserved by the Spirit That
   searcheth and knoweth all things, not destroyed in the waters, nor
   scattered abroad as the calf's head which was hastily made by Israel
   was by Moses, [4618] for a reproach for their hardness of heart.

   XVII.  Nor would it be right for us to pass over the manner of this
   eating either, for the Law does not do so, but carries its mystical
   labour even to this point in the literal enactment.  Let us consume the
   Victim in haste, eating It with unleavened bread, with bitter herbs,
   and with our loins girded, and our shoes on our feet, and leaning on
   staves like old men; with haste, that we fall not into that fault which
   was forbidden to Lot [4619] by the commandment, that we look not
   around, nor stay in all that neighbourhood, but that we escape to the
   mountain, that we be not overtaken by the strange fire of Sodom, nor be
   congealed into a pillar of salt in consequence of our turning back to
   wickedness; for this is the result of delay.  With bitter herbs, for a
   life according to the Will of God is bitter and arduous, especially to
   beginners, and higher than pleasures.  For although the new yoke is
   easy and the burden light, [4620] as you are told, yet this is on
   account of the hope and the reward, which is far more abundant than the
   hardships of this life.  If it were not so, who would not say that the
   Gospel is more full of toil and trouble than the enactments of the
   Law?  For, while the Law prohibits only the completed acts of sin, we
   are condemned for the causes also, almost as if they were acts.  The
   Law says, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but you may not even desire,
   kindling passion by curious and earnest looks.  Thou shalt not kill,
   says the Law; but you are not even to return a blow, but on the
   contrary are to offer yourself to the smiter.  How much more ascetic is
   the Gospel than the Law!  Thou shalt not forswear thyself is the Law;
   but you are not to swear at all, either a greater or a lesser oath, for
   an oath is the parent of perjury.  Thou shalt not join house to house,
   nor field to field, oppressing the poor; [4621] but you are to set
   aside willingly even your just possessions, and to be stripped for the
   poor, that without encumbrance you may take up the Cross [4622] and be
   enriched with the unseen riches.

   XVIII.  And let the loins of the unreasoning animals be unbound and
   loose, for they have not the gift of reason which can overcome pleasure
   (it is not needful to say that even they know the limit of natural
   movement).  But let that part of your being which is the seat of
   passion, and which neighs, [4623] as Holy Scripture calls it, when
   sweeping away this shameful passion, be restrained by a girdle of
   continence, so that you may eat the Passover purely, having mortified
   your members which are upon the earth, [4624] and copying the girdle
   [4625] of John, the Hermit and Forerunner and great Herald of the
   Truth.  Another girdle I know, the soldierly and manly one, I mean,
   from which the Euzoni of Syria and certain Monozoni [4626] take their
   name.  And it is in respect of this too that God saith in an oracle to
   Job, "Nay, but gird up thy loins like a man, and give a manly answer."
   [4627]   With this also holy David boasts that he is girded with
   strength from God, [4628] and speaks of God Himself as clothed with
   strength [4629] and girded about with power--against the ungodly of
   course--though perhaps some may prefer to see in this a declaration of
   the abundance of His power, and, as it were, its restraint, just as
   also He clothes Himself with Light as with a garment. [4630]   For who
   shall endure His unrestrained power and light?  Do I enquire what there
   is common to the loins and to truth?  What then is the meaning to S.
   Paul of the expression, "Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about
   with truth?" [4631]   Is it perhaps that contemplation is to restrain
   concupiscence, and not to allow it to be carried in another direction?
   For that which is disposed to love in a particular direction will not
   have the same power towards other pleasures.

   XIX.  And as to shoes, let him who is about to touch the Holy Land
   which the feet of God have trodden, put them off, as Moses did upon the
   Mount, [4632] that he may bring there nothing dead; nothing to come
   between Man and God.  So too if any disciple is sent to preach the
   Gospel, let him go in a spirit of philosophy and without excess,
   inasmuch as he must, besides being without money and without staff and
   with but one coat, also be barefooted, [4633] that the feet of those
   who preach the Gospel of Peace and every other good may appear
   beautiful. [4634]   But he who would flee from Egypt and the things of
   Egypt must put on shoes for safety's sake, especially in regard to the
   scorpions and snakes in which Egypt so abounds, so as not to be injured
   by those which watch the heel [4635] which also we are bidden to tread
   under foot. [4636]   And concerning the staff and the signification of
   it, my belief is as follows.  There is one I know to lean upon, and
   another which belongs to Pastors and Teachers, and which corrects human
   sheep.  Now the Law prescribes to you the staff to lean upon, that you
   may not break down in your mind when you hear of God's Blood, and His
   Passion, and His death; and that you may not be carried away to heresy
   in your defence of God; but without shame and without doubt may eat the
   Flesh and drink the Blood, if you are desirous of true life, neither
   disbelieving His words about His Flesh, nor offended at those about His
   Passion.  Lean upon this, and stand firm and strong, in nothing shaken
   by the adversaries nor carried away by the plausibility of their
   arguments.  Stand upon thy High Place; in the Courts of Jerusalem
   [4637] place thy feet; lean upon the Rock, that thy steps in God be not
   shaken.

   XX.  What sayest thou?  Thus it hath pleased Him that thou shouldest
   come forth [4638] out of Egypt, the iron furnace; that thou shouldest
   leave behind the idolatry of that country, and be led by Moses and his
   lawgiving and martial rule.  I give thee a piece of advice which is not
   my own, or rather which is very much my own, if thou consider the
   matter spiritually.  Borrow from the Egyptians vessels of gold and
   silver; [4639] with these take thy journey; supply thyself for the road
   with the goods of strangers, or rather with thine own.  There is money
   owing to thee, the wages of thy bondage and of thy brickmaking; be
   clever on thy side too in asking retribution; be an honest robber.
   Thou didst suffer wrong there whilst thou wast fighting with the clay
   (that is, this troublesome and filthy body) and wast building cities
   foreign and unsafe, whose memorial perishes with a cry. [4640]   What
   then?  Dost thou come out for nothing and without wages?  But why wilt
   thou leave to the Egyptians and to the powers of thine adversaries that
   which they have gained by wickedness, and will spend with yet greater
   wickedness?  It does not belong to them:  they have ravished it, and
   have sacrilegiously taken it as plunder from Him who saith, The silver
   is Mine and the gold is Mine, [4641] and I give it to whom I will.
   Yesterday it was theirs, for it was permitted to be so; to-day the
   Master takes it and gives it to thee, [4642] that thou mayest make a
   good and saving use of it.  Let us make to ourselves friends of the
   Mammon of unrighteousness, [4643] that when we fail, they may receive
   us in the time of judgment.

   XXI.  If you are a Rachel or a Leah, a patriarchal and great soul,
   steal whatever idols of your father you can find; [4644] not, however,
   that you may keep them, but that you may destroy them; and if you are a
   wise Israelite remove them to the Land of the Promise, and let the
   persecutor grieve over the loss of them, and learn through being
   outwitted that it was vain for him to tyrannize over and keep in
   bondage better men than himself.  If thou doest this, and comest out of
   Egypt thus, I know well that thou shalt be guided by the pillar of fire
   and cloud by night and day. [4645]   The wilderness shall be tamed for
   thee, and the Sea divided; [4646] Pharaoh shall be drowned; [4647]
   bread shall be rained down: [4648]   the rock shall become a fountain;
   [4649] Amalek shall be conquered, not with arms alone, but with the
   hostile hand of the righteous forming both prayers and the invincible
   trophy of the Cross; [4650] the River shall be cut off; the sun shall
   stand still; and the moon be restrained; [4651] walls shall be
   overthrown even without engines; [4652] swarms of hornets shall go
   before thee to make a way for Israel, and to hold the Gentiles in
   check; [4653] and all the other events which are told in the history
   after these and with these (not to make a long story) shall be given
   thee of God.  Such is the feast thou art keeping to-day; and in this
   manner I would have thee celebrate both the Birthday and the Burial of
   Him Who was born for thee and suffered for thee.  Such is the Mystery
   of the Passover; such are the mysteries sketched by the Law and
   fulfilled by Christ, the Abolisher of the letter, the Perfecter of the
   Spirit, who by His Passion taught us how to suffer, and by His
   glorification grants us to be glorified with Him.

   XXII. [4654]   Now we are to examine another fact and dogma, neglected
   by most people, but in my judgment well worth enquiring into.  To Whom
   was that Blood offered that was shed for us, and why was It shed?  I
   mean the precious and famous Blood of our God and High priest and
   Sacrifice.  We were detained in bondage by the Evil One, sold under
   sin, and receiving pleasure in exchange for wickedness.  Now, since a
   ransom belongs only to him who holds in bondage, I ask to whom was this
   offered, and for what cause?  If to the Evil One, fie upon the
   outrage!  If the robber receives ransom, not only from God, but a
   ransom which consists of God Himself, and has such an illustrious
   payment for his tyranny, a payment for whose sake it would have been
   right for him to have left us alone altogether.  But if to the Father,
   I ask first, how?  For it was not by Him that we were being oppressed;
   and next, On what principle did the Blood of His Only begotten Son
   delight the Father, Who would not receive even Isaac, when he was being
   offered by his Father, but changed the sacrifice, putting a ram in the
   place of the human victim? [4655]   Is it not evident that the Father
   accepts Him, but neither asked for Him nor demanded Him; but on account
   of the Incarnation, and because Humanity must be sanctified by the
   Humanity of God, [4656] that He might deliver us Himself, and overcome
   the tyrant, and draw us to Himself by the mediation of His Son, Who
   also arranged this to the honour of the Father, Whom it is manifest
   that He obeys in all things?  So much we have said of Christ; the
   greater part of what we might say shall be reverenced with silence.
   But that brazen serpent [4657] was hung up as a remedy for the biting
   serpents, not as a type of Him that suffered for us, but as a contrast;
   and it saved those that looked upon it, not because they believed it to
   live, but because it was killed, and killed with it the powers that
   were subject to it, being destroyed as it deserved.  And what is the
   fitting epitaph for it from us?  "O death, where is thy sting?  O
   grave, where is thy victory?" [4658]   Thou art overthrown by the
   Cross; thou art slain by Him who is the Giver of life; thou art without
   breath, dead, without motion, even though thou keepest the form of a
   serpent lifted up on high on a pole.

   XXIII.  Now we will partake of a Passover which is still typical;
   though it is plainer than the old one.  For that is ever new which is
   now becoming known.  It is ours to learn what is that drinking and that
   enjoyment, and His to teach and communicate the Word to His disciples.
   For teaching is food, even to the Giver of food.  Come hither then, and
   let us partake of the Law, but in a Gospel manner, not a literal one;
   perfectly, not imperfectly; eternally, not temporarily.  Let us make
   our Head, not the earthly Jerusalem, but the heavenly City; [4659] not
   that which is now trodden under foot by armies, [4660] but that which
   is glorified by Angels.  Let us sacrifice not young calves, nor lambs
   that put forth horns and hoofs, [4661] in which many parts are
   destitute of life and feeling; but let us sacrifice to God the
   sacrifice of praise upon the heavenly Altar, with the heavenly dances;
   let us hold aside the first veil; let us approach the second, and look
   into the Holy of Holies. [4662]   Shall I say that which is a greater
   thing yet?  Let us sacrifice ourselves to God; or rather let us go on
   sacrificing throughout every day and at every moment.  Let us accept
   anything for the Word's sake.  By sufferings let us imitate His
   Passion:  by our blood let us reverence His Blood:  let us gladly mount
   upon the Cross.  Sweet are the nails, though they be very painful.  For
   to suffer with Christ and for Christ is better than a life of ease with
   others.

   XXIV.  If you are a Simon of Cyrene, [4663] take up the Cross and
   follow.  If you are crucified with Him as a robber, [4664] acknowledge
   God as a penitent robber.  If even He was numbered among the
   transgressors [4665] for you and your sin, do you become law-abiding
   for His sake.  Worship Him Who was hanged for you, even if you yourself
   are hanging; make some gain even from your wickedness; purchase
   salvation by your death; enter with Jesus into Paradise, [4666] so that
   you may learn from what you have fallen. [4667]   Contemplate the
   glories that are there; let the murderer die outside with his
   blasphemies; and if you be a Joseph of Arimathæa, [4668] beg the Body
   from him that crucified Him, make thine own that which cleanses the
   world. [4669]   If you be a Nicodemus, the worshipper of God by night,
   bury Him with spices. [4670]   If you be a Mary, or another Mary, or a
   Salome, or a Joanna, weep in the early morning.  Be first to see the
   stone taken away, [4671] and perhaps you will see the Angels and Jesus
   Himself.  Say something; hear His Voice.  If He say to you, Touch Me
   not, [4672] stand afar off; reverence the Word, but grieve not; for He
   knoweth those to whom He appeareth first.  Keep the feast of the
   Resurrection; come to the aid of Eve who was first to fall, of Her who
   first embraced the Christ, and made Him known to the disciples.  Be a
   Peter or a John; hasten to the Sepulchre, running together, running
   against one another, vying in the noble race. [4673]   And even if you
   be beaten in speed, win the victory of zeal; not Looking into the tomb,
   but Going in.  And if, like a Thomas, you were left out when the
   disciples were assembled to whom Christ shews Himself, when you do see
   Him be not faithless; [4674] and if you do not believe, then believe
   those who tell you; and if you cannot believe them either, then have
   confidence in the print of the nails.  If He descend into Hell, [4675]
   descend with Him.  Learn to know the mysteries of Christ there also,
   what is the providential purpose of the twofold descent, to save all
   men absolutely by His manifestation, or there too only them that
   believe.

   XXV.  And if He ascend up into Heaven, [4676] ascend with Him.  Be one
   of those angels who escort Him, or one of those who receive Him.  Bid
   the gates be lifted up, [4677] or be made higher, that they may receive
   Him, exalted after His Passion.  Answer to those who are in doubt
   because He bears up with Him His body and the tokens of His Passion,
   which He had not when He came down, and who therefore inquire, "Who is
   this King of Glory?" that it is the Lord strong and mighty, as in all
   things that He hath done from time to time and does, so now in His
   battle and triumph for the sake of Mankind.  And give to the doubting
   of the question the twofold answer.  And if they marvel and say as in
   Isaiah's drama Who is this that cometh from Edom and from the things of
   earth? Or How are the garments red of Him that is without blood or
   body, as of one that treads in the full wine-press? [4678] set forth
   the beauty of the array of the Body that suffered, adorned by the
   Passion, and made splendid by the Godhead, than which nothing can be
   more lovely or more beautiful.

   XXVI. [4679]   To this what will those cavillers say, those bitter
   reasoners about Godhead, those detractors of all things that are
   praiseworthy, those darkeners of Light, uncultured in respect of
   Wisdom, for whom Christ died in vain, unthankful creatures, the work of
   the Evil One.  Do you turn this benefit into a reproach to God?  Will
   you deem Him little on this account, that He humbled Himself for your
   sake, and because to seek for that which had wandered the Good
   Shepherd, He who layeth down His life for the sheep, [4680] came upon
   the mountains and hills upon which you used to sacrifice, [4681] and
   found the wandering one; and having found it, took it upon His
   shoulders, [4682] on which He also bore the wood; and having borne it,
   brought it back to the life above; and having brought it back, numbered
   it among those who have never strayed.  That He lit a candle, [4683]
   His own flesh, and swept the house, by cleansing away the sin of the
   world, and sought for the coin, the Royal Image that was all covered up
   with passions, and calls together His friends, the Angelic Powers, at
   the finding of the coin, and makes them sharers of His joy, as He had
   before made them sharers of the secret of His Incarnation?  That the
   Light that is exceeding bright should follow the Candle--Forerunner,
   [4684] and the Word, the Voice, and the Bridegroom, the Bridegroom's
   friend, [4685] that prepared for the Lord a peculiar people [4686] and
   cleansed them by the water [4687] in preparation for the Spirit?  Do
   you Reproach God with this?  Do you conceive of Him as less because He
   girds Himself with a towel and washes His disciples, [4688] and shows
   that humiliation is the best road to exaltation; [4689] because He
   humbles Himself for the sake of the soul that is bent down to the
   ground, [4690] that He may even exalt with Himself that which is bent
   double under a weight of sin?  How comes it that you do not also charge
   it upon Him as a crime that He eateth with Publicans [4691] and at
   Publicans' tables, and makes disciples of Publicans [4692] that He too
   may make some gain.  And what gain?  The salvation of sinners.  If so,
   one must blame the physician for stooping over suffering and putting up
   with evil smells in order to give health to the sick; and him also who
   leans over the ditch, that he may, according to the Law, save the beast
   that has fallen into it.

   XXVII.  He was sent, but sent according to His Manhood (for He was of
   two Natures), since He was hungry and thirsty and weary, and was
   distressed and wept, according to the Laws of human nature.  But even
   if He were sent also as God, what of that?  Consider the Mission to be
   the good pleasure of the Father, to which He refers all that concerns
   Himself, both that He may honour the Eternal Principle, and that He may
   avoid the appearance of being a rival God.  For He is said on the one
   hand to have been betrayed, and on the other it is written that He gave
   Himself up; and so too that He was raised and taken up by the Father,
   and also that of His own power He rose and ascended.  The former
   belongs to the Good Pleasure, the latter to His own Authority; but you
   dwell upon all that diminishes Him, while you ignore all that exalts
   Him.  For instance, you score that He suffered, but you do not add "of
   His own Will."  Ah, what things has the Word even now to suffer!  By
   some He is honoured as God but confused with the Father; by others He
   is dishonoured as Flesh, and is severed from God.  With whom shall He
   be most angry--or rather which shall He forgive--those who falsely
   contract Him, or those who divide Him?  For the former ought to have
   made a distinction, and the latter to have made a Union, the one in
   number, the other in Godhead.  Do you stumble at His Flesh?  So did the
   Jews.  Do you call Him a Samaritan, [4693] and the rest which I will
   not utter?  This did not even the demons, O man more unbelieving than
   demons, and more stupid than Jews.  The Jews recognized the title Son
   as expressing equal rank; and the demons knew that He who drove them
   out was God, for they were persuaded by their own experience.  But you
   will not either admit the equality or confess the Godhead.  It would
   have been better for you to have been circumcised and a demoniac--to
   reduce the matter to an absurdity--than in uncircumcision and robust
   health to be thus ill and ungodly disposed.  But for our war with such
   men, let it be brought to an end by their returning, however late, to a
   sound mind, if they will; or else if they will not, let it be postponed
   to another occasion, if they continue as they are.  Anyhow, we will
   have no fear when contending for the Trinity with the help of the
   Trinity.

   XXVIII.  It is now needful for us to sum up our discourse as follows:
   We were created that we might be made happy.  We were made happy when
   we were created.  We were entrusted with Paradise that we might enjoy
   life.  We received a Commandment that we might obtain a good repute by
   keeping it; not that God did not know what would take place, but
   because He had laid down the law of Free Will.  We were deceived
   because we were the objects of envy.  We were cast out because we
   transgressed.  We fasted because we refused to fast, being overpowered
   by the Tree of Knowledge.  For the Commandment was ancient, coeval with
   ourselves, and was a kind of education of our souls and curb of luxury,
   to which we were reasonably made subject, in order that we might
   recover by keeping it that which we had lost by not keeping it.  We
   needed an Incarnate God, a God put to death, that we might live.  We
   were put to death together with Him, that we might be cleansed; we rose
   again with Him because we were put to death with Him; we were glorified
   with Him, because we rose again with Him.

   XXIX.  Many indeed are the miracles of that time:  God crucified; the
   sun darkened and again rekindled; for it was fitting that the creatures
   should suffer with their Creator; the veil rent; the Blood and Water
   shed from His Side; the one as from a man, the other as above man; the
   rocks rent for the Rock's sake; the dead raised for a pledge of the
   final Resurrection of all men; the Signs at the Sepulchre and after the
   Sepulchre, which none can worthily celebrate; and yet none of these
   equal to the Miracle of my salvation.  A few drops of Blood recreate
   the whole world, and become to all men what rennet is to milk, drawing
   us together and compressing us into unity.

   XXX.  But, O Pascha, great and holy and purifier of all the world--for
   I will speak to thee as to a living person--O Word of God and Light and
   Life and Wisdom and Might--for I rejoice in all Thy names--O Offspring
   and Expression and Signet of the Great Mind; O Word conceived and Man
   contemplated, Who bearest all things, binding them by the Word of Thy
   power; receive this discourse, not now as firstfruits, but perhaps as
   the completion of my offerings, a thanksgiving, and at the same time a
   supplication, that we may suffer no evil beyond those necessary and
   sacred cares in which our life has been passed; and stay the tyranny of
   the body over us; (Thou seest, O Lord, how great it is and how it bows
   me down) or Thine own sentence, if we are to be condemned by Thee.  But
   if we are to be released, in accordance with our desire, and be
   received into the Heavenly Tabernacle, there too it may be we shall
   offer Thee acceptable Sacrifices upon Thine Altar, to Father and Word
   and Holy Ghost; for to Thee belongeth all glory and honour and might,
   world without end.  Amen.

   [4590] The reading eudokia of the Received Text is pronounced by
   Tischendorf to have less authority than eudokias, which he adopts on
   the testimony of important mss., but chiefly on the strength of a
   citation and comment three times in Origen, and because all the Latin
   Fathers read bonæ voluntatis.  Lachmann, Tregelles, Westcott, and with
   some hesitation Alford follow him; though Tregelles and Westcott allow
   eudokias a place in the margin.  Wordsworth (giving no reason); and
   Scrivener because he thinks it makes better sense, read eudokia, and
   scout eudokias; which, however, is found in four of the five oldest
   mss., and in all the Latin versions and Fathers.  The Greek Fathers,
   however, all but unanimously support the Received Text.

   [4591] heorte heorton, kai paneguris panegurion.  heorte says Nicetas,
   is one thing, paneguris another.  heorte is the Commemoration of a
   Saint; paneguris is Easter, or Ascension, or some other mystical
   festival.  Thus Synesius calls the Paschal Letters of the Alexandrian
   Patriarch panegurika grammata.

   [4592] This passage to the end of c. ix. occurs verbatim in the oration
   on the Theophany, cc. vii.-xiii.

   [4593] "There is no Past in Eternity, and no Future; for that which is
   past has ceased to be, and that which is future has not yet come into
   existence; but Eternity is only Present; it has no Past which does not
   still exist nor any Future which does not yet exist" (S. Augustine de
   Vera Rel., c. 49).

   [4594] The Environment here spoken of seems to mean those created
   Existences of which God is the Self-Existent Cause.

   [4596] Wisd. ii. 24.

   [4597] Pascha represents the Hebrew PHSKH.  Throughout 2 Chron. the
   LXX. represents the word by Phasek, which like Pascha is a
   transliteration of the Hebrew word.  The form which the transliteration
   takes is due to the fact that the Greek language does not tolerate
   these two aspirates in juxtapostion.  S. Gregory is correct in
   remarking that Pascha has no real connection with pascho (to suffer),
   though it might appear to unlearned ears that it has.

   [4598] Heb. x. 1.

   [4599] Exod. xxv. 40.

   [4600] aphairema is given by the Lexicons as the Heave-Offering, and it
   is certainly used in that sense among others (all sacrificial) in the
   LXX.  Suicer, however, follows Suidas in regarding the word as quite
   general; he also quotes Zonaras' definition, "Quod offertur aphairema
   dicitur, quod a toto mactatæ animantis corpore abstractum sit."
   Balsamon, according to the same authority, makes it the portion which
   was severed from the carcase of the victim and set apart for the Priest
   (i.e., the heave-offering, Lev. vii. 14, 32).

   [4601] Rom. xi. 33.

   [4602] The Jewish Sacrifices had a deep inner meaning and mystery.  In
   a limited sense they may be called Sacraments of the future Atonement,
   which they prefigured and appealed to.  But only in a limited sense can
   they be so called, because they did not convey grace to the soul, but
   only appealed to the grace to come; and so the Sin-offerings of the Law
   are only said to cover, not to take away sin.  They removed the
   spiritual disqualification for worship; but they did not restore full
   Spiritual Communion with God.  Still they were not altogether
   unhallowed or useless like those of the heathen, inasmuch as they did
   point forward and plead the merits of the One true Sacrifice.

   [4603] Isa. xiii. 3.

   [4604] Mal. iv. 2.

   [4605] The Greek here is very obscure.  The meaning seems to be that
   which Nicetas suggests, viz.:--that our Lord in coming to earth and
   becoming Incarnate did not in His Divine Nature leave Heaven, but was,
   while still here on earth in His own words, "The Son of Man Which is in
   Heaven."

   [4606] Christ is "a blessed crown of goodness" according to the saying
   of David, Thou shalt bless the crown of the year with Thy goodness (Ps.
   lxv. 11).  The idea of a year is taken from the Sun; that of the crown
   from the year (for the year is a circle guarded with four seasons), and
   from the circle again equality.  Therefore the crown is Christ, as
   adorning and beautifying the minds of believers.  But the year of
   Goodness was that time when Christ moved by goodness was declaring the
   Gospel, as Isaiah saith of Him, "He hath sent Me to preach the Gospel
   to the poor, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord" (Isa. lxi. 1,
   2).  Thus the Crown is on every side equal.  For if one draw a line
   from the upper side to the lower, and the same in a transverse
   direction, all the intervals will be equal.  And the Crown is like
   itself, because its figure is seen alike on every side, for on every
   side it is seen as a round.  Therefore Christ as to His Humanity is
   called a Crown of Righteousness, as composed of all the virtues, and
   having no end of His goodness and righteousness; and of that
   righteousness one quality is equality, that is, it allows neither
   excess nor defect.  For excess and defect do not arise from virtue and
   righteousness, but from fault and unrighteousness (Nicetas).

   [4609] Matt. xxv. 33.

   [4610] Judith v. 6.

   [4611] Ps. cxxxviii. 9.

   [4612] We are to part with leaven for seven days (Exod. xii. 15), that
   is, with sin for the whole week of this life.  The number Seven Days
   signifies the passing of time which revolves in weeks.  And this number
   is mystical, because it is virgin and signifies virginity and the
   angelic life; for it alone, as arithmeticians teach, of all the numbers
   within the decade, is neither a multiple nor a measure, and also
   contains in itself the Four and the Three.  For there are four elements
   of the world, and the Trinity is their Creator.  He calls it
   co-ordinate with the world, because the world was made in seven days,
   and again because when seven thousand years are completed the end of
   the world is to come (Nicetas).  S. Augustine (Civ. Dei. c. ii. 31)
   says that the number Seven often stands for the Universe, because it is
   made up of Four which is altogether even (2 and 2 the sum of two even
   numbers) and Three which is altogether uneven (1 and 1 and 1).

   [4613] Isa. vi. 6.

   [4614] Luke xii. 49.

   [4615] Ephes. iv. 26.

   [4616] S. Gregory does not mean to say that our Lord's death was
   actually hastened by violent actions on the part of the Jews, which we
   know was not the case; but that they were anxious that it should take
   place before the Sabbath began.  The two thieves, who were still
   living, received the coup de grace from the Roman soldiers, who broke
   their legs; but our Lord, much to their astonishment was dead already,
   so this course was not taken with Him, but His side was pierced with a
   spear.

   A Selection from the Letters of Saint Gregory Nazianzen, Sometime
   Archbishop of Constantinople.

   ------------------------

   Division I.

   Letters on the Apollinarian Controversy.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   The circumstances which called forth the two letters to Cledonius have
   already been described in the first section of the General Prolegomena,
   and it will not be necessary here to add much to what was there said.
   In the letter to Nectarius, his own successor on the throne of
   Constantinople, written about a.d. 383, and sometimes reckoned as Orat.
   XLVI., S. Gregory gives extracts from a work of Apollinarius himself,
   but without mentioning the title of the book.  In this treatise the
   fundamental errors of the heresy (see Proleg. c. 1, p. 172) are laid
   down.  Apollinarius, according to S. Gregory, declares that the Son of
   God was from all eternity clothed with a human body, and not from the
   time of His conception only by the Blessed Virgin; but that this
   humanity of God is without human mind, the place of which was supplied
   by the Godhead of the Only-begotten.  And he goes even further and
   ascribes passibility and mortality to the very Godhead of Christ.
   Therefore S. Gregory earnestly protests against any toleration being
   granted to these heretics, or even permission to hold their assemblies;
   for, he says, toleration or permission would certainly be regarded by
   them as a condonation of their doctrinal position, and a condemnation
   of that of the Church.  Dr. Ullman, however, thinks that while S.
   Gregory was certainly speaking the truth in saying that he had in his
   hands a pamphlet by Apollinarius, yet that he, perhaps unconsciously,
   exaggerated the heretical character of its contents, pushing its
   statements to consequences which Apollinarius would have repudiated.
   The one purpose of the latter was, in Dr. Ullman's view, to safeguard
   the doctrine of the Unity of Christ; and he thought that the orthodox
   expression of Two Whole and Perfect Natures tended to a Nestorian
   division of the Person of Christ; and so he used language which
   certainly seemed to confound the natures, or at any rate to make the
   Incarnation imperfect, inasmuch as a Christ in Whom the human mind is
   absent, and its place filled up by the Godhead of the Son, cannot be
   said to be perfect Man.  But while Epiphanius mentions these
   extravagances of the heresy, and does so with a lingering feeling of
   regret for the lapse of so good a man whose services in the past had
   been of so much value to the Church, yet, in the spirit common to
   Ecclesiastical authorities of the time, he would rather ascribe them to
   an expansion of Apollinarius' teaching by his younger disciples who did
   not really understand what Apollinarius himself meant.

   Olympius, to whom the last of this series is addressed, was Governor of
   Cappadocia Secunda in a.d. 382.  He was a man for whom S. Gregory had a
   very high esteem, and with whom he was upon terms of close friendship,
   as will be seen from other letters of Gregory to him in another
   division of this Selection.  The occasion of the present letter was the
   necessity to appeal to the secular power for aid to punish a sect of
   Apollinarians at Nazianzus, who had ventured to take advantage of S.
   Gregory's absence at the Baths of Xanxaris to procure the consecration
   of a Bishop of their own way of thinking.  Technically the See was
   vacant, but the administration had been committed to Gregory by the
   Bishops of the Province, and though he, foreseeing some such attempt on
   the part of the heretics, had been very earnest in pressing upon the
   Metropolitan and his Comprovincials the necessity of filling this
   throne by a canonical election, yet he was by no means prepared to hand
   over the authority, with which he had been invested, to an irregularly
   elected and uncanonically consecrated heretic.

   To Nectarius, Bishop of Constantinople.  (Ep. CCII.)

   The Care of God, which throughout the time before us guarded the
   Churches, seems to have utterly forsaken this present life.  And my
   soul is immersed to such a degree by calamities that the private
   sufferings of my own life hardly seem to be worth reckoning among evils
   (though they are so numerous and great, that if they befel anyone else
   I should think them unbearable); but I can only look at the common
   sufferings of the Churches; for if at the present crisis some pains be
   not taken to find a remedy for them, things will gradually get into an
   altogether desperate condition.  Those who follow the heresy of Arius
   or Eudoxius (I cannot say who stirred them up to this folly) are making
   a display of their disease, as if they had attained some degree of
   confidence by collecting congregations as if by permission.  And they
   of the Macedonian party have reached such a pitch of folly that they
   are arrogating to themselves the name of Bishops, and are wandering
   about our districts babbling of Eleusius [4694] as to their
   ordinations.  Our bosom evil, Eunomius, is no longer content with
   merely existing; but unless he can draw away everyone with him to his
   ruinous heresy, he thinks himself an injured man.  All this, however,
   is endurable.  The most grievous item of all in the woes of the Church
   is the boldness of the Apollinarians, whom your Holiness has
   overlooked, I know not how, when providing themselves with authority to
   hold meetings on an equality with myself.  However, you being, as you
   are, thoroughly instructed by the grace of God in the Divine Mysteries
   on all points, are well informed, not only as to the advocacy of the
   true faith, but also as to all those arguments which have been devised
   by the heretics against the sound faith; and yet perhaps it will not be
   unseasonable that your Excellency should hear from my littleness that a
   pamphlet by Apollinarius has come into my hands, the contents of which
   surpass all heretical pravity.  For he asserts that the Flesh which the
   Only-begotten Son assumed in the Incarnation for the remodelling of our
   nature was no new acquisition, but that that carnal nature was in the
   Son from the beginning.  And he puts forward as a witness to this
   monstrous assertion a garbled quotation from the Gospels, namely, No
   man hath Ascended up into Heaven save He which came down from Heaven,
   even the Son of Man which is in Heaven. [4695]   As though even before
   He came down He was the Son of Man, and when He came down He brought
   with Him that Flesh, which it appears He had in Heaven, as though it
   had existed before the ages, and been joined with His Essence.  For he
   alleges another saying of an Apostle, which he cuts off from the whole
   body of its context, that The Second Man is the Lord from Heaven.
   [4696]   Then he assumes that that Man who came down from above is
   without a mind, but that the Godhead of the Only-begotten fulfils the
   function of mind, and is the third part of this human composite,
   inasmuch as soul and body are in it on its human side, but not mind,
   the place of which is taken by God the Word.  This is not yet the most
   serious part of it; that which is most terrible of all is that he
   declares that the Only-begotten God, the Judge of all, the Prince of
   Life, the Destroyer of Death, is mortal, and underwent the Passion in
   His proper Godhead; and that in the three days' death of His body, His
   Godhead also was put to death with His body, and thus was raised again
   from the dead by the Father.  It would be tedious to go through all the
   other propositions which he adds to these monstrous absurdities.  Now,
   if they who hold such views have authority to meet, your Wisdom
   approved in Christ must see that, inasmuch as we do not approve their
   views, any permission of assembly granted to them is nothing less than
   a declaration that their view is thought more true than ours.  For if
   they are permitted to teach their view as godly men, and with all
   confidence to preach their doctrine, it is manifest that the doctrine
   of the Church has been condemned, as though the truth were on their
   side.  For nature does not admit of two contrary doctrines on the same
   subject being both true.  How then could your noble and lofty mind
   submit to suspend your usual courage in regard to the correction of so
   great an evil?  But even though there is no precedent for such a
   course, let your inimitable perfection in virtue stand up at a crisis
   like the present, and teach our most pious Emperor, that no gain will
   come from his zeal for the Church on other points if he allows such an
   evil to gain strength from freedom of speech for the subversion of
   sound faith.

   [4694] Eleusius was Bishop of Cyzicus, a prominent leader of the
   Semi-Arian party.  He bore a very high character for personal holiness,
   and approached more nearly to orthodoxy than most of his associates,
   men like Basil of Ancyra, Eustathius of Sebaste, etc.  He obstinately
   maintained, however, Macedonian views on the Deity of the Holy Ghost,
   even after their condemnation by the Council of Constantinople.

   To Cledonius the Priest Against Apollinarius.  (Ep. CI.)

   To our most reverend and God-beloved brother and fellow-priest
   Cledonius, Gregory, greeting in the Lord.

   I desire to learn what is this fashion of innovation in things
   Concerning the Church, which allows anyone who likes, or the passerby,
   [4697] as the Bible says, to tear asunder the flock that has been well
   led, and to plunder it by larcenous attacks, or rather by piratical and
   fallacious teachings.  For if our present assailants had any ground for
   condemning us in regard of the faith, it would not have been right for
   them, even in that case, to have ventured on such a course without
   giving us notice.  They ought rather to have first persuaded us, or to
   have been willing to be persuaded by us (if at least any account is to
   be taken of us as fearing God, labouring for the faith, and helping the
   Church), and then, if at all, to innovate; but then perhaps there would
   be an excuse for their outrageous conduct.  But since our faith has
   been proclaimed, both in writing and without writing, here and in
   distant parts, in times of danger and of safety, how comes it that some
   make such attempts, and that others keep silence?

   The most grievous part of it is not (though this too is shocking) that
   the men instil their own heresy into simpler souls by means of those
   who are worse; but that they also tell lies about us and say that we
   share their opinions and sentiments; thus baiting their hooks, and by
   this cloak villainously fulfilling their will, and making our
   simplicity, which looked upon them as brothers and not as foes, into a
   support of their wickedness.  And not only so, but they also assert, as
   I am told, that they have been received by the Western Synod, by which
   they were formerly condemned, as is well known to everyone.  If,
   however, those who hold the views of Apollinarius have either now or
   formerly been received, let them prove it and we will be content.  For
   it is evident that they can only have been so received as assenting to
   the Orthodox Faith, for this were an impossibility on any other terms.
   And they can surely prove it, either by the minutes of the Synod, or by
   Letters of Communion, for this is the regular custom of Synods.  But if
   it is mere words, and an invention of their own, devised for the sake
   of appearances and to give them weight with the multitude through the
   credit of the persons, teach them to hold their tongues, and confute
   them; for we believe that such a task is well suited to your manner of
   life and orthodoxy.  Do not let the men deceive themselves and others
   with the assertion that the "Man of the Lord," as they call Him, Who is
   rather our Lord and God, is without human mind.  For we do not sever
   the Man from the Godhead, but we lay down as a dogma the Unity and
   Identity of Person, Who of old was not Man but God, and the Only Son
   before all ages, unmingled with body or anything corporeal; but Who in
   these last days has assumed Manhood also for our salvation; passible in
   His Flesh, impassible in His Godhead; circumscript in the body,
   uncircumscript in the Spirit; at once earthly and heavenly, tangible
   and intangible, comprehensible and incomprehensible; that by One and
   the Same Person, Who was perfect Man and also God, the entire humanity
   fallen through sin might be created anew.

   If anyone does not believe that Holy Mary is the Mother of God, he is
   severed from the Godhead.  If anyone should assert that He passed
   through the Virgin as through a channel, and was not at once divinely
   and humanly formed in her (divinely, because without the intervention
   of a man; humanly, because in accordance with the laws of gestation),
   he is in like manner godless.  If any assert that the Manhood was
   formed and afterward was clothed with the Godhead, he too is to be
   condemned.  For this were not a Generation of God, but a shirking of
   generation.  If any introduce the notion of Two Sons, one of God the
   Father, the other of the Mother, and discredits the Unity and Identity,
   may he lose his part in the adoption promised to those who believe
   aright.  For God and Man are two natures, as also soul and body are;
   but there are not two Sons or two Gods.  For neither in this life are
   there two manhoods; though Paul speaks in some such language of the
   inner and outer man.  And (if I am to speak concisely) the Saviour is
   made of elements which are distinct from one another (for the invisible
   is not the same with the visible, nor the timeless with that which is
   subject to time), yet He is not two Persons.  God forbid!  For both
   natures are one by the combination, the Deity being made Man, and the
   Manhood deified or however one should express it.  And I say different
   Elements, because it is the reverse of what is the case in the Trinity;
   for There we acknowledge different Persons so as not to confound the
   persons; but not different Elements, for the Three are One and the same
   in Godhead.

   If any should say that it wrought in Him by grace as in a Prophet, but
   was not and is not united with Him in Essence--let him be empty of the
   Higher Energy, or rather full of the opposite.  If any worship not the
   Crucified, let him be Anathema and be numbered among the Deicides.  If
   any assert that He was made perfect by works, or that after His
   Baptism, or after His Resurrection from the dead, He was counted worthy
   of an adoptive Sonship, like those whom the Greeks interpolate as added
   to the ranks of the gods, let him be anathema.  For that which has a
   beginning or a progress or is made perfect, is not God, although the
   expressions may be used of His gradual manifestation.  If any assert
   that He has now put off His holy flesh, and that His Godhead is
   stripped of the body, and deny that He is now with His body and will
   come again with it, let him not see the glory of His Coming.  For where
   is His body now, if not with Him Who assumed it?  For it is not laid by
   in the sun, according to the babble of the Manichæans, that it should
   be honoured by a dishonour; nor was it poured forth into the air and
   dissolved, as is the nature of a voice or the flow of an odour, or the
   course of a lightning flash that never stands.  Where in that case were
   His being handled after the Resurrection, or His being seen hereafter
   by them that pierced Him, for Godhead is in its nature invisible.  Nay;
   He will come with His body--so I have learnt--such as He was seen by
   His Disciples in the Mount, or as he shewed Himself for a moment, when
   his Godhead overpowered the carnality.  And as we say this to disarm
   suspicion, so we write the other to correct the novel teaching.  If
   anyone assert that His flesh came down from heaven, and is not from
   hence, nor of us though above us, let him be anathema.  For the words,
   The Second Man is the Lord from Heaven; [4698] and, As is the Heavenly,
   such are they that are Heavenly; and, No man hath ascended up into
   Heaven save He which came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which
   is in Heaven; [4699] and the like, are to be understood as said on
   account of the Union with the heavenly; just as that All Things were
   made by Christ, [4700] and that Christ dwelleth in your hearts [4701]
   is said, not of the visible nature which belongs to God, but of what is
   perceived by the mind, the names being mingled like the natures, and
   flowing into one another, according to the law of their intimate union.

   If anyone has put his trust in Him as a Man without a human mind, he is
   really bereft of mind, and quite unworthy of salvation.  For that which
   He has not assumed He has not healed; but that which is united to His
   Godhead is also saved.  If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ
   assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature
   fell, it must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten,
   and so be saved as a whole.  Let them not, then, begrudge us our
   complete salvation, or clothe the Saviour only with bones and nerves
   and the portraiture of humanity.  For if His Manhood is without soul,
   even the Arians admit this, that they may attribute His Passion to the
   Godhead, as that which gives motion to the body is also that which
   suffers.  But if He has a soul, and yet is without a mind, how is He
   man, for man is not a mindless animal?  And this would necessarily
   involve that while His form and tabernacle was human, His soul should
   be that of a horse or an ox, or some other of the brute creation.
   This, then, would be what He saves; and I have been deceived by the
   Truth, and led to boast of an honour which had been bestowed upon
   another.  But if His Manhood is intellectual and nor without mind, let
   them cease to be thus really mindless.  But, says such an one, the
   Godhead took the place of the human intellect.  How does this touch
   me?  For Godhead joined to flesh alone is not man, nor to soul alone,
   nor to both apart from intellect, which is the most essential part of
   man.  Keep then the whole man, and mingle Godhead therewith, that you
   may benefit me in my completeness.  But, he asserts, He could not
   contain Two perfect Natures.  Not if you only look at Him in a bodily
   fashion.  For a bushel measure will not hold two bushels, nor will the
   space of one body hold two or more bodies.  But if you will look at
   what is mental and incorporeal, remember that I in my one personality
   can contain soul and reason and mind and the Holy Spirit; and before me
   this world, by which I mean the system of things visible and invisible,
   contained Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  For such is the nature of
   intellectual Existences, that they can mingle with one another and with
   bodies, incorporeally and invisibly.  For many sounds are comprehended
   by one ear; and the eyes of many are occupied by the same visible
   objects, and the smell by odours; nor are the senses narrowed by each
   other, or crowded out, nor the objects of sense diminished by the
   multitude of the perceptions.  But where is there mind of man or angel
   so perfect in comparison of the Godhead that the presence of the
   greater must crowd out the other?  The light is nothing compared with
   the sun, nor a little damp compared with a river, that we must first do
   away with the lesser, and take the light from a house, or the moisture
   from the earth, to enable it to contain the greater and more perfect.
   For how shall one thing contain two completenesses, either the house,
   the sunbeam and the sun, or the earth, the moisture and the river?
   Here is matter for inquiry; for indeed the question is worthy of much
   consideration.  Do they not know, then, that what is perfect by
   comparison with one thing may be imperfect by comparison with another,
   as a hill compared with a mountain, or a grain of mustard seed with a
   bean or any other of the larger seeds, although it may be called larger
   than any of the same kind?  Or, if you like, an Angel compared with
   God, or a man with an Angel.  So our mind is perfect and commanding,
   but only in respect of soul and body; not absolutely perfect; and a
   servant and a subject of God, not a sharer of His Princedom and honour.
    So Moses was a God to Pharaoh, [4702] but a servant of God, [4703] as
   it is written; and the stars which illumine the night are hidden by the
   Sun, so much that you could not even know of their existence by
   daylight; and a little torch brought near a great blaze is neither
   destroyed, nor seen, nor extinguished; but is all one blaze, the bigger
   one prevailing over the other.

   But, it may be said, our mind is subject to condemnation.  What then of
   our flesh?  Is that not subject to condemnation?  You must therefore
   either set aside the latter on account of sin, or admit the former on
   account of salvation.  If He assumed the worse that He might sanctify
   it by His incarnation, may He not assume the better that it may be
   sanctified by His becoming Man?  If the clay was leavened and has
   become a new lump, O ye wise men, shall not the Image be leavened and
   mingled with God, being deified by His Godhead?  And I will add this
   also:  If the mind was utterly rejected, as prone to sin and subject to
   damnation, and for this reason He assumed a body but left out the mind,
   then there is an excuse for them who sin with the mind; for the witness
   of God--according to you--has shewn the impossibility of healing it.
   Let me state the greater results.  You, my good sir, dishonour my mind
   (you a Sarcolater, if I am an Anthropolater [4704] ) that you may tie
   God down to the Flesh, since He cannot be otherwise tied; and therefore
   you take away the wall of partition.  But what is my theory, who am but
   an ignorant man, and no Philosopher.  Mind is mingled with mind, as
   nearer and more closely related, and through it with flesh, being a
   Mediator between God and carnality.

   Further let us see what is their account of the assumption of Manhood,
   or the assumption of Flesh, as they call it.  If it was in order that
   God, otherwise incomprehensible, might be comprehended, and might
   converse with men through His Flesh as through a veil, their mask and
   the drama which they represent is a pretty one, not to say that it was
   open to Him to converse with us in other ways, as of old, in the
   burning bush [4705] and in the appearance of a man. [4706]   But if it
   was that He might destroy the condemnation by sanctifying like by like,
   then as He needed flesh for the sake of the flesh which had incurred
   condemnation, and soul for the sake of our soul, so, too, He needed
   mind for the sake of mind, which not only fell in Adam, but was the
   first to be affected, as the doctors say of illnesses.  For that which
   received the command was that which failed to keep the command, and
   that which failed to keep it was that also which dared to transgress;
   and that which transgressed was that which stood most in need of
   salvation; and that which needed salvation was that which also He took
   upon Him.  Therefore, Mind was taken upon Him.  This has now been
   demonstrated, whether they like it or no, by, to use their own
   expression, geometrical and necessary proofs.  But you are acting as
   if, when a man's eye had been injured and his foot had been injured in
   consequence, you were to attend to the foot and leave the eye uncared
   for; or as if, when a painter had drawn something badly, you were to
   alter the picture, but to pass over the artist as if he had succeeded.
   But if they, overwhelmed by these arguments, take refuge in the
   proposition that it is possible for God to save man even apart from
   mind, why, I suppose that it would be possible for Him to do so also
   apart from flesh by a mere act of will, just as He works all other
   things, and has wrought them without body.  Take away, then, the flesh
   as well as the mind, that your monstrous folly may be complete.  But
   they are deceived by the latter, and, therefore, they run to the flesh,
   because they do not know the custom of Scripture.  We will teach them
   this also.  For what need is there even to mention to those who know
   it, the fact that everywhere in Scripture he is called Man, and the Son
   of Man?

   If, however, they rely on the passage, The Word was made Flesh and
   dwelt among us, [4707] and because of this erase the noblest part of
   Man (as cobblers do the thicker part of skins) that they may join
   together God and Flesh, it is time for them to say that God is God only
   of flesh, and not of souls, because it is written, "As Thou hast given
   Him power over all Flesh," [4708] and "Unto Thee shall all Flesh come;"
   [4709] and "Let all Flesh bless His holy Name," [4710] meaning every
   Man.  Or, again, they must suppose that our fathers went down into
   Egypt without bodies and invisible, and that only the Soul of Joseph
   was imprisoned by Pharaoh, because it is written, "They went down into
   Egypt with threescore and fifteen Souls," [4711] and "The iron entered
   into his Soul," [4712] a thing which could not be bound.  They who
   argue thus do not know that such expressions are used by Synecdoche,
   declaring the whole by the part, as when Scripture says that the young
   ravens call upon God, [4713] to indicate the whole feathered race; or
   Pleiades, Hesperus, and Arcturus [4714] are mentioned, instead of all
   the Stars and His Providence over them.

   Moreover, in no other way was it possible for the Love of God toward us
   to be manifested than by making mention of our flesh, and that for our
   sake He descended even to our lower part.  For that flesh is less
   precious than soul, everyone who has a spark of sense will
   acknowledge.  And so the passage, The Word was made Flesh, seems to me
   to be equivalent to that in which it is said that He was made sin,
   [4715] or a curse [4716] for us; not that the Lord was transformed into
   either of these, how could He be?  But because by taking them upon Him
   He took away our sins and bore our iniquities. [4717]   This, then, is
   sufficient to say at the present time for the sake of clearness and of
   being understood by the many.  And I write it, not with any desire to
   compose a treatise, but only to check the progress of deceit; and if it
   is thought well, I will give a fuller account of these matters at
   greater length.

   But there is a matter which is graver than these, a special point which
   it is necessary that I should not pass over.  I would they were even
   cut off that trouble you, [4718] and would reintroduce a second
   Judaism, and a second circumcision, and a second system of sacrifices.
   For if this be done, what hinders Christ also being born again to set
   them aside, and again being betrayed by Judas, and crucified and
   buried, and rising again, that all may be fulfilled in the same order,
   like the Greek system of cycles, in which the same revolutions of the
   stars bring round the same events?  For what the method of selection
   is, in accordance with which some of the events are to occur and others
   to be omitted, let these wise men who glory in the multitude of their
   books shew us.

   But since, puffed up by their theory of the Trinity, they falsely
   accuse us of being unsound in the Faith and entice the multitude, it is
   necessary that people should know that Apollinarius, while granting the
   Name of Godhead to the Holy Ghost, did not preserve the Power of the
   Godhead.  For to make the Trinity consist of Great, Greater, and
   Greatest, as of Light, Ray, and Sun, the Spirit and the Son and the
   Father (as is clearly stated in his writings), is a ladder of Godhead
   not leading to Heaven, but down from Heaven.  But we recognize God the
   Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and these not as bare titles,
   dividing inequalities of ranks or of power, but as there is one and the
   same title, so there is one nature and one substance in the Godhead.

   But if anyone who thinks we have spoken rightly on this subject
   reproaches us with holding communion with heretics, let him prove that
   we are open to this charge, and we will either convince him or retire.
   But it is not safe to make any innovation before judgment is given,
   especially in a matter of such importance, and connected with so great
   issues.  We have protested and continue to protest this before God and
   men.  And not even now, be well assured, should we have written this,
   if we had not seen that the Church was being torn asunder and divided,
   among their other tricks, by their present synagogue of vanity. [4719]
     But if anyone when we say and protest this, either from some
   advantage they will thus gain, or through fear of men, or monstrous
   littleness of mind, or through some neglect of pastors and governors,
   or through love of novelty and proneness to innovations, rejects us as
   unworthy of credit, and attaches himself to such men, and divides the
   noble body of the Church, he shall bear his judgment, whoever he may
   be, [4720] and shall give account to God in the day of judgment. [4721]
     But if their long books, and their new Psalters, contrary to that of
   David, and the grace of their metres, are taken for a third Testament,
   we too will compose Psalms, and will write much in metre.  For we also
   think we have the spirit of God, [4722] if indeed this is a gift of the
   Spirit, and not a human novelty.  This I will that thou declare
   publicly, that we may not be held responsible, as overlooking such an
   evil, and as though this wicked doctrine received food and strength
   from our indifference.

   Against Apollinarius; The Second Letter to Cledonius.  (Ep. CII.)

   Forasmuch as many persons have come to your Reverence seeking
   confirmation of their faith, and therefore you have affectionately
   asked me to put forth a brief definition and rule of my opinion, I
   therefore write to your Reverence, what indeed you knew before, that I
   never have and never can honour anything above the Nicene Faith, that
   of the Holy Fathers who met there to destroy the Arian heresy; but am,
   and by God's help ever will be, of that faith; completing in detail
   that which was incompletely said by them concerning the Holy Ghost; for
   that question had not then been mooted, namely, that we are to believe
   that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are of one Godhead, thus
   confessing the Spirit also to be God.  Receive then to communion those
   who think and teach thus, as I also do; but those who are otherwise
   minded refuse, and hold them as strangers to God and the Catholic
   Church.  And since a question has also been mooted concerning the
   Divine Assumption of humanity, or Incarnation, state this also clearly
   to all concerning me, that I join in One the Son, who was begotten of
   the Father, and afterward of the Virgin Mary, and that I do not call
   Him two Sons, but worship Him as One and the same in undivided Godhead
   and honour.  But if anyone does not assent to this statement, either
   now or hereafter, he shall give account to God at the day of judgment.

   Now, what we object and oppose to their mindless opinion about His Mind
   is this, to put it shortly; for they are almost alone in the condition
   which they lay down, as it is through want of mind that they mutilate
   His mind.  But, that they may not accuse us of having once accepted but
   of now repudiating the faith of their beloved Vitalius [4723] which he
   handed in in writing at the request of the blessed Bishop Damasus of
   Rome, I will give a short explanation on this point also.  For these
   men, when they are theologizing among their genuine disciples, and
   those who are initiated into their secrets, like the Manichæans among
   those whom they call the "Elect," expose the full extent of their
   disease, and scarcely allow flesh at all to the Saviour.  But when they
   are refuted and pressed with the common answers about the Incarnation
   which the Scripture presents, they confess indeed the orthodox words,
   but they do violence to the sense; for they acknowledge the Manhood to
   be neither without soul nor without reason nor without mind, nor
   imperfect, but they bring in the Godhead to supply the soul and reason
   and mind, as though It had mingled Itself only with His flesh, and not
   with the other properties belonging to us men; although His sinlessness
   was far above us, and was the cleansing of our passions.

   Thus, then, they interpret wrongly the words, But we have the Mind of
   Christ, [4724] and very absurdly, when they say that His Godhead is the
   mind of Christ, and not understanding the passage as we do, namely,
   that they who have purified their mind by the imitation of the mind
   which the Saviour took of us, and, as far as may be, have attained
   conformity with it, are said to have the mind of Christ; just as they
   might be testified to have the flesh of Christ who have trained their
   flesh, and in this respect have become of the same body and partakers
   of Christ; and so he says "As we have borne the image of the earth
   [4725] we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."  And so they
   declare that the Perfect Man is not He who was in all points tempted
   like as we are yet without sin; [4726] but the mixture of God and
   Flesh.  For what, say they, can be more perfect than this?

   They play the same trick with the word that describes the Incarnation,
   viz.:  He was made Man, explaining it to mean, not, He was in the human
   nature with which He surrounded Himself, according to the Scripture, He
   knew what was in man; [4727] but teaching that it means, He consorted
   and conversed with men, and taking refuge in the expression which says
   that He was seen on Earth and conversed with Men. [4728]   And what can
   anyone contend further?  They who take away the Humanity and the
   Interior Image cleanse by their newly invented mask only our outside,
   [4729] and that which is seen; so far in conflict with themselves that
   at one time, for the sake of the flesh, they explain all the rest in a
   gross and carnal manner (for it is from hence that they have derived
   their second Judaism and their silly thousand years delight in
   paradise, and almost the idea that we shall resume again the same
   conditions after these same thousand years); and at another time they
   bring in His flesh as a phantom rather than a reality, as not having
   been subjected to any of our experiences, not even such as are free
   from sin; and use for this purpose the apostolic expression, understood
   and spoken in a sense which is not apostolic, that our Saviour was made
   in the likeness of Men and found in fashion as a Man, [4730] as though
   by these words was expressed, not the human form, but some delusive
   phantom and appearance.

   Since then these expressions, rightly understood, make for orthodoxy,
   but wrongly interpreted are heretical, what is there to be surprised at
   if we received the words of Vitalius in the more orthodox sense; our
   desire that they should be so meant persuading us, though others are
   angry at the intention of his writings?  This is, I think, the reason
   why Damasus himself, having been subsequently better informed, and at
   the same time learning that they hold by their former explanations,
   excommunicated them and overturned their written confession of faith
   with an Anathema; as well as because he was vexed at the deceit which
   he had suffered from them through simplicity.

   Since, then, they have been openly convicted of this, let them not be
   angry, but let them be ashamed of themselves; and let them not slander
   us, but abase themselves and wipe off from their portals that great and
   marvellous proclamation and boast of their orthodoxy, meeting all who
   go in at once with the question and distinction that we must worship,
   not a God-bearing Man, but a flesh-bearing God.  What could be more
   unreasonable than this, though these new heralds of truth think a great
   deal of the title?  For though it has a certain sophistical grace
   through the quickness of its antithesis, and a sort of juggling
   quackery grateful to the uninstructed, yet it is the most absurd of
   absurdities and the most foolish of follies.  For if one were to change
   the word Man or Flesh into God (the first would please us, the second
   them), and then were to use this wonderful antithesis, so divinely
   recognized, what conclusion should we arrive at?  That we must worship,
   not a God-bearing Flesh, but a Man-bearing God.  O monstrous
   absurdity!  They proclaim to us to-day a wisdom hidden ever since the
   time of Christ--a thing worthy of our tears.  For if the faith began
   thirty years ago, when nearly four hundred years had passed since
   Christ was manifested, vain all that time will have been our Gospel,
   and vain our faith; in vain will the Martyrs have borne their witness,
   and in vain have so many and so great Prelates presided over the
   people; and Grace is a matter of metres and not of the faith.

   And who will not marvel at their learning, in that on their own
   authority they divide the things of Christ, and assign to His Manhood
   such sayings as He was born, He was tempted, He was hungry, He was
   thirsty, He was wearied, He was asleep; but reckon to His Divinity such
   as these:  He was glorified by Angels, He overcame the Tempter, He fed
   the people in the wilderness, and He fed them in such a manner, and He
   walked upon the sea; and say on the one hand that the "Where have ye
   laid Lazarus?" [4731] belongs to us, but the loud voice "Lazarus, Come
   Forth" [4732] and the raising him that had been four days dead, is
   above our nature; and that while the "He was in an Agony, He was
   crucified, He was buried," belongs to the Veil, on the other hand, "He
   was confident, He rose again, He ascended," belong to the Inner
   Treasure; and then they accuse us of introducing two natures, separate
   or conflicting, and of dividing the supernatural and wondrous Union.
   They ought, either not to do that of which they accuse us, or not to
   accuse us of that which they do; so at least if they are resolved to be
   consistent and not to propound at once their own and their opponents'
   principles.  Such is their want of reason; it conflicts both with
   itself and with the truth to such an extent that they are neither
   conscious nor ashamed of it when they fall out with themselves.  Now,
   if anyone thinks that we write all this willingly and not upon
   compulsion, and that we are dissuading from unity, and not doing our
   utmost to promote it, let him know that he is very much mistaken, and
   has not made at all a good guess at our desires, for nothing is or ever
   has been more valuable in our eyes than peace, as the facts themselves
   prove; though their actions and brawlings against us altogether exclude
   unanimity.

   [4723] Vitalius or Vitalis was one of the principal followers of
   Apollinarius, and by him was consecrated schismatical Bishop of
   Antioch, where, while yet orthodox, he had been ordained a priest by
   Meletius.  But he quarrelled with his Bishop through jealousy of
   another priest, and then fell under the influence of Apollinarius.  He
   was summoned to Rome to clear himself of the charge of heresy; and by a
   clever manipulation of language he produced a confession which the
   Pope, Damasus, accepted as orthodox; but the Pope remitted the whole
   case to Paulinus, who was at that time recognized by the Western Church
   as rightful Bishop.  Vitalius, however, was unable to accept the test
   required, and seceded.  On his return from Rome he had visited
   Nazianzus, where S. Gregory received him as a brother in the faith,
   though further acquaintance compelled him to withdraw from this
   position.  Vitalius, while admitting that our Lord had both a human
   body and a human soul, denied Him a human mind; whose place, according
   to his teaching, was supplied by Divinity.

   Ep. CXXV.  To Olympius.

   Even hoar hairs have something to learn; and old age, it would seem,
   cannot in all respects be trusted for wisdom.  I at any rate, knowing
   better than anyone, as I did, the thoughts and the heresy of the
   Apollinarians, and seeing that their folly was intolerable; yet
   thinking that I could tame them by patience and soften them by degrees,
   I let my hopes make me eager to attain this object.  But, as it seems,
   I overlooked the fact that I was making them worse, and injuring the
   Church by my untimely philosophy.  For gentleness does not put bad men
   out of countenance.  And now if it had been possible for me to teach
   you this myself, I should not have hesitated, you may be sure, even to
   undertake a journey beyond my strength to throw myself at the feet of
   your Excellency.  But since my illness has brought me too far, and it
   has become necessary for me to try the hot baths of Xanxaris at the
   advice of my medical men, I send a letter to represent me.  These
   wicked and utterly abandoned men have dared, in addition to all their
   other misdeeds, either to summon, or to make a bad use of the passage
   (I am not prepared to say precisely which) of certain Bishops, deprived
   by the whole Synod of the Eastern and Western Church; and, in violation
   of all Imperial Ordinances, and of your commands, to confer the name of
   Bishop on a certain individual of their own misbelieving and deceitful
   crew; encouraged to do so, as I believe, by nothing so much as my great
   infirmity; for I must mention this.  If this is to be tolerated, your
   Excellency will tolerate it, and I too will bear it, as I have often
   before.  But if it is serious, and not to be endured by our most august
   Emperors, pray punish what has been done--though more mildly than such
   madness merits.

   Division II.

   Correspondence with Saint Basil the Great, Archbishop of Cæsarea.

   Ep. I.  To Basil His Comrade.

   (Perhaps about a.d. 357 or 358; in answer to a letter which is not now
   extant.)

   I have failed, I confess, to keep my promise.  I had engaged even at
   Athens, at the time of our friendship and intimate connection there
   (for I can find no better word for it), to join you in a life of
   philosophy.  But I failed to keep my promise, not of my own will, but
   because one law prevailed against another; I mean the law which bids us
   honour our parents overpowered the law of our friendship and
   intercourse.  Yet I will not fail you altogether, if you will accept
   this offer.  I shall be with you half the time, and half of it you will
   be with me, that we may have the whole in common, and that our
   friendship may be on equal terms; and so it will be arranged in such a
   way that my parents will not be grieved, and yet I shall gain you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. II.

   (Written about the same time, in reply to another letter now lost.)

   I do not like being joked about Tiberina and its mud and its winters, O
   my friend, who are so free from mud, and who walk on tiptoe, and
   trample on the plains.  You who have wings and are borne aloft, and fly
   like the arrows of Abaris, in order that, Cappadocian though you are,
   you may flee from Cappadocia.  Have we done you an injury, because
   while you are pale and breathing hard and measuring the sun, we are
   sleek and well fed and not pressed for room?  Yet this is your
   condition.  You are luxurious and rich, and go to market.  I do not
   approve of this.  Either then cease to reproach us with our mud (for
   you did not build your city, nor we make our winter), or else for our
   mud we will bring against you your hucksters, and the rest of the crop
   of nuisances which infest cities.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. IV.

   (In answer to Ep. XIV., of Basil, about 361.)

   You may mock and pull to pieces my affairs, whether in jest or in
   earnest.  This is a matter of no consequence; only laugh, and take your
   fill of culture, and enjoy my friendship.  Everything that comes from
   you is pleasant to me, no matter what it may be, and how it may look.
   For I think you are chaffing about things here, not for the sake of
   chaffing, but that you may draw me to yourself, if I understand you at
   all; just like people who block up streams in order to draw them into
   another channel.  That is how your sayings always seem to me.

   For my part I will admire your Pontus and your Pontic darkness, and
   your dwelling place so worthy of exile, and the hills over your head,
   and the wild beasts which test your faith, and your sequestered spot
   that lies under them...or as I should say your mousehole with the
   stately names of Abode of Thought, Monastery, School; and your thickets
   of wild bushes, and crown of precipitous mountains, by which may you
   be, not crowned but, cloistered; and your limited air; and the sun, for
   which you long, and can only see as through a chimney, O sunless
   Cimmerians of Pontus, who are condemned not only to a six months'
   night, as some are said to be, but who have not even a part of your
   life out of the shadow, but all your life is one long night, and a real
   shadow of death, to use a Scripture phrase.  And admire your strait and
   narrow road, leading...I know not if it be to the Kingdom, or to Hades,
   but for your sake I hope it is the Kingdom...And as for the intervening
   country, what is your wish?  Am I falsely to call it Eden, and the
   fountain divided into four heads, by which the world is watered, or the
   dry and waterless wilderness (only what Moses will come to tame it,
   bringing water out of the rock with his staff)?  For all of it which
   has escaped the rocks is full of gullies; and that which is not a gully
   is a thicket of thorns; and whatever is above the thorns is a
   precipice; and the road above that is precipitous, and slopes both
   ways, exercising the mind of travellers, and calling for gymnastic
   exercises for safety.  And the river rushes roaring down, which to you
   is a Strymon of Amphipolis for quietness, and there are not so many
   fishes in it as stones, nor does it flow into a lake, but it dashes
   into abysses, O my grandiloquent friend and inventor of new names.  For
   it is great and terrible, and overwhelms the psalmody of those who live
   above it; like the Cataracts and Catadoupa of the Nile, so does it roar
   you down day and night.  It is rough and fordless; and it has only this
   morsel of kindness about it, that it does not sweep away your dwelling
   when the torrents and winter storms make it mad.  This then is what I
   think of those Fortunate Islands and of you happy people.  And you are
   not to admire the crescent-shaped curves which strangle rather than cut
   off the accessible parts of your Highlands, and the strip of mountain
   ridge that hangs over your heads, and makes your life like that of
   Tantalus; and the draughty breezes, and the vent-holes of the earth,
   which refresh your courage when it fails; and your musical birds that
   sing (but only of famine), and fly about (but only about the desert).
   No one visits it, you say, except for hunting; you might add, and
   except to look upon your dead bodies.  This is perhaps too long for a
   letter, but it is too short for a comedy.  If you can take my jokes
   kindly you will do well, but if not, I will send you some more.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. V.

   (Circa a.d. 361.)

   Since you do take my jokes kindly, I send you the rest.  My prelude is
   from Homer.

   "Come now and change thy theme,

   And sing of the inner adornment."

   --Od. viii. 492.

   Your roofless and doorless hut, your fireless and smokeless hearth,
   your walls dried by fire, that we may not be hit by the drops of the
   mud, condemned like Tantalus thirsting in the midst of waters, and that
   pitiable feast with nothing to eat, to which we were invited from
   Cappadocia, not as to a Lotus-eater's poverty, but to a table of
   Alcinous--we young and miserable survivors of a wreck.  For I remember
   those loaves and the broth (so it was called), yes, and I shall
   remember them too, and my poor teeth that slipped on your hunks of
   bread, and then braced themselves up, and pulled themselves as it were
   out of mud.  You yourself will raise these things to a higher strain of
   tragedy, having learnt to talk big through your own sufferings...for if
   we had not been quickly delivered by that great supporter of the
   poor--I mean your mother--who appeared opportunely like a harbour to
   men tossed by a storm, we should long ago have been dead, rather pitied
   than admired for our faith in Pontus.  How shall I pass over that
   garden which was no garden and had no vegetables, and the Augean
   dunghill which we cleared out of the house, and with which we filled it
   up (sc. the garden), when we drew that mountainous wagon, I the
   vintager, and you the valiant, with our necks and hands, which still
   bear the traces of our labours.  "O earth and sun, O air and virtue"
   (for I will indulge a little in tragic tones), not that we might bridge
   the Hellespont, but that we might level a precipice.  If you are not
   put out by the mention of the circumstances, no more am I; but if you
   are, how much more was I by the reality.  I pass by the rest, through
   respect for the others from whom I received much enjoyment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. VI.

   (Written about the same time, in a more serious vein.)

   What I wrote before about our stay in Pontus was in joke, not in
   earnest; what I write now is very much in earnest.  O that one would
   place me as in the month of those former days, [4733] in which I
   luxuriated with you in hard living; since voluntary pain is more
   valuable than involuntary delight.  O that one would give me back those
   psalmodies and vigils and those sojournings with God in prayer, and
   that immaterial, so to speak, and unbodied life.  O for the intimacy
   and one-souledness of the brethren who were by you divinized and
   exalted:  O for the contest and incitement of virtue which we secured
   by written Rules and Canons; O for the loving labour in the Divine
   Oracles, and the light we found in them by the guidance of the Holy
   Ghost.  Or, if I may speak of lesser and slighter matters, O for the
   daily courses and experiences; O for the gatherings of wood, and the
   cutting of stone; O for the golden plane-tree, more precious than that
   of Xerxes, under which sat, not a King enfeebled by luxury, but a Monk
   worn out by hard life, which I planted and Apollos (I mean your
   honourable self) watered; [4734] but God gave the increase to our
   honour, that a memorial might remain among you of my diligence, as in
   the Ark we read and believe, did Aaron's rod that budded. [4735]   To
   long for all this is very easy, but it is not easy to attain it.  But
   do you come to me, and conspire with me in virtue, and co-operate with
   me, and aid me by your prayers to keep the profit which we used to get
   together, that I may not perish by little and little, like a shadow as
   the day draws to its close.  I would rather breathe you than the air,
   and only live while I am with you, either actually in your presence, or
   virtually by your likeness in your absence.

   Ep. VIII.

   (Written to S. Basil shortly after his Ordination as Priest, probably
   toward the end of a.d. 362.)

   I approve the beginning of your letter; but what is there of yours that
   I do not approve?  And you are convicted of having written just like
   me; [4736] for I, too, was forced into the rank of the Priesthood, for
   indeed I never was eager for it.  We are to one another, if ever any
   men were, trustworthy witnesses of our love for a humble and lowly
   philosophy.  But perhaps it would have been better that this had not
   happened, or I know not what to say, as long as I am in ignorance of
   the purpose of the Holy Ghost.  But since it has come about, we must
   bear it, at least so it seems clear to me; and especially when we take
   the times into consideration, which are bringing in upon us so many
   heretical tongues, and must not put to shame either the hopes of those
   who have trusted us thus, or our own lives.

   Ep. XIX.

   (This Epistle should be read in connection with the three addressed to
   Eusebius of Cæsarea, to which it refers.  For the circumstances see
   General Prolegomena, § 1, p. 194.)

   It is a time for prudence and endurance, and that we should not let
   anyone appear to be of higher courage than ourselves, or let all our
   labours and toils be in an instant brought to nothing.  Why do I write
   this, and wherefore?  Our Bishop Eusebius, very dear to God (for so we
   must for the future both think and write of him), is very much disposed
   to agreement and friendship with us; and as fire softens iron, so has
   time softened him; and I think a letter of appeal and invitation will
   come to you from him, as he intimated to me, and as many persons who
   are well acquainted with his affairs assure me.  Let us be beforehand
   with him then, either by going to him, or by writing to him; or rather
   by first writing and then going; in order that we may not by and by be
   put to shame by being defeated when it was in our power to secure a
   victory by being honourably and philosophically beaten, which so many
   are asking from us.  Be persuaded by me then, and come; both on this
   account and on account of the bad times; for a conspiracy of heretics
   is assailing the Church; some of them are here now, and are troubling
   us; and others, rumour says, are coming; and there is reason to fear
   lest the Word of Truth should be swept away, unless there be stirred up
   very soon the spirit of a Bezaleel, the wise Master builder of such
   arguments and dogmas.  If you think I ought to go too, to stay with you
   and travel with you, I will not refuse to do even this.

   (We insert here the three letters to Eusebius, which are so closely
   connected with the above as not to seem out of place.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XVI.  To Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea.

   Since I am addressing a man who does not love falsehood, and who is the
   keenest man I know at detecting it in another, however it may be twined
   in skilful and varied labyrinths; and, moreover, on my own part I will
   say it, though against the grain I do not like artifice, either, both
   from my natural constitution, and because God's Word has formed me so.
   Therefore I write what presents itself to my mind; and I beg you to
   excuse my plain speaking, or you will wrong the truth by depriving me
   of my liberty, and forcing me to restrain within myself the pain of my
   grief, like some secret and malignant disease.  I rejoice that I have
   your respect (for I am a man, as some one has said before), and that I
   am summoned to Synods and spiritual conferences.  But I am troubled at
   the slight which has been inflicted on my most Reverend brother Basil,
   and is still inflicted on him by Your Reverence; for I chose him as the
   companion of my life and words and highest philosophy, and he is so
   still; and I never had reason to regret my judgment of him.  It is more
   temperate to speak thus of him, that I may not seem to be praising
   myself in admiring him.  You, however, I think, by honouring me and
   dishonouring him, seem to be acting like a man who should with one hand
   stroke a man's head, and with the other hand strike him on the face; or
   while tearing up the foundations of a house should paint the walls and
   decorate the exterior.  If then you will listen to me, this is what you
   will do, and I claim to be listened to, for this is justice.  If you
   will pay due attention to him, he will do the like by you.  And I will
   follow him as a shadow does the body, being of little worth and
   inclined to peace.  For I am not so mean as to be willing in other
   respects to philosophize, and to be of the better part, but to overlook
   a matter which is the end of all our teaching, namely love; especially
   in regard to a Priest, and one of so high a character, and one whom I
   know of all my acquaintances to be the best both in life and doctrine
   and conduct.  For my pain shall not obscure the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XVII.  To Eusebius, Archbishop of Cæsarea.

   I did not write in an insolent spirit, as you complain of my letter,
   but rather in a spiritual and philosophical one, and as was fitting,
   unless this too wrongs "your most eloquent Gregory."  For though you
   are my Superior in rank, yet you will grant me something of liberty and
   just freedom of speech.  Therefore be kinder to me.  But if you regard
   my letter as coming from a servant, and from one who has not the right
   even to look you in the face, I will in this instance accept your
   stripes and not even shed a tear.  Will you blame me for this also?
   That would befit anyone rather than your Reverence.  For it is the part
   of a high-souled man to accept more readily the freedom of a friend
   than the flattery of an enemy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XVIII.  To Eusebius of Cæsarea.

   I was never meanly disposed towards your Reverence; do not find me
   guilty.  But after allowing myself a little liberty and boldness, just
   to relieve and heal my grief, I at once bowed and submitted, and
   willingly subjected myself to the Canon.  What else could I have done,
   knowing both you and the Law of the Spirit?  But if I had been ever so
   mean and ignoble in my sentiments, yet the present time would not allow
   such feelings, nor the wild beasts which are rushing on the Church, nor
   your own courage and manliness, so purely and genuinely fighting for
   the Church.  I will come then, if you wish it, and take part with you
   in prayers and in conflict, and will serve you, and like cheering boys
   will stir up the noble athlete by my exhortations.

   Ep. XL.  To the Great Basil.

   (About the middle of the year 370.  On the death of Eusebius Basil
   seems to have formed a desire that his friend Gregory should succeed to
   the vacant Metropolitanate; and so he wrote to him, without mentioning
   the death of the Archbishop, to come to him at Cæsarea, representing
   himself as dangerously ill.  Gregory, deeply grieved at the news, set
   off at once, but had not proceeded far on his way when he learned that
   Basil was in his usual health, and that the Bishops of the Province
   were assembling at Cæsarea for the Election of a Metropolitan.  He saw
   through the artifice at once; and thinking that Basil had wished to
   secure his presence at the Metropolis in order that his influence might
   bring about his own (Basil's) Election, he wrote him the following
   indignant letter.  Nevertheless both he and his father felt that no one
   was so well fitted to succeed to the vacant throne; and so Gregory
   wrote in his father's name the three letters which we have placed next,
   addressed respectively to the people of Cæsarea, to the Bishops
   attending the Synod, and to Eusebius Bishop of Samosata.)

   Do not be surprized if I say something strange, which has not been said
   before by anyone.  I think you have the reputation of being a steady
   safe and strong-minded man, but also of being more simple than safe in
   much that you plan and do.  For that which is free from evil is also in
   proportion slow to suspect evil, as is shewn by what has just
   occurred.  You have summoned me to the Metropolis at the moment when a
   council has been called for the election of a Bishop, and your pretext
   is very seemly and plausible.  You pretend to be very ill, indeed at
   your last breath, and to long to see me and to bid me a last farewell;
   I do not know with what object, even what my presence can effect in the
   matter.  I started in great grief at what had happened; for what could
   be of higher value to me than your life, or more distressing than your
   departure?  And I shed a fountain of tears; and I wailed aloud; and I
   felt myself now for the first time unphilosophically disposed.  What
   did I leave unperformed of all that befits a funeral?  But as soon as I
   found that the Bishops were assembling at the City, at once I stopped
   short in my course; and I wondered first that you had not perceived
   what was proper, or guarded against people's tongues, which are so
   given to slander the guileless; and secondly that you did not think the
   same course to be fitting for me as for yourself, though our life and
   our rule and everything is common to us both, who have been so closely
   associated by God from the first.  Thirdly, for I must say this also, I
   wondered whether you remembered that such nominations are worthy of the
   more religious, not of the more powerful, nor of those most in favour
   with the multitude.  For these reasons then I backed water, and held
   back.  Now, if you think as I do, come to this determination, to avoid
   these public turmoils and evil suspicions.  I shall see your Reverence
   when the matters are settled and time allows, and I shall have more and
   graver reproaches to address to you.

   Ep. XLI.  To the People of Cæsarea, in His Father's Name.

   I am a little shepherd, and preside over a tiny flock, and I am among
   the least of the servants of the Spirit.  But Grace is not narrow, or
   circumscribed by place.  Wherefore let freedom of speech be given even
   to the small,--especially when the subject matter is of such great
   importance, and one in which all are interested--even to deliberate
   with men of hoary hairs, who speak with perhaps greater wisdom than the
   ordinary run of men.  You are deliberating on no ordinary or
   unimportant matter, but on one by which the common interest must
   necessarily be promoted or injured according to the decision at which
   you arrive.  For our subject matter is the Church, for which Christ
   died, and the guide who is to present it and lead it to God.  For the
   light of the body is the eye, [4737] as we have heard; not only the
   bodily eye which sees and is seen, but that which contemplates and is
   contemplated spiritually.  But the light of the Church is the Bishop,
   as is evident to you even without our writing it.  As then the
   straightness or crookedness of the course of the body depends upon the
   clearness or dulness of the eye, so must the Church necessarily share
   the peril or safety incurred by the conduct of its Chief.  You must
   then take thought for the whole Church as the Body of Christ, but more
   especially for your own, which was from the beginning and is now the
   Mother of almost all the Churches, to which all the Commonwealth looks,
   like a circle described round a centre, not only because of its
   orthodoxy proclaimed of old to all, but also because of the grace of
   unanimity so evidently bestowed upon it by God.  You then have summoned
   us also to your discussion of this matter, and so are acting rightly
   and canonically.  But we are oppressed by age and infirmity, and if we
   by the strength given us by the Holy Ghost could be present (nothing is
   incredible to them that believe), this would be best for the common
   welfare and most pleasant to ourselves, that we might confer something
   on you, and ourselves have a part of the blessing; but if I should be
   kept away through weakness, I will give at any rate whatever can be
   given by one who is absent.

   I believe that there are others among you worthy of the Primacy, both
   because of the greatness of your city, and because it has been governed
   in times past so excellently and by such great men; but there is one
   man among you to whom I cannot prefer any, our son well beloved of God,
   Basil the Priest (I speak before God as my witness); a man of pure life
   and word, and alone, or almost alone, of all qualified in both respects
   to stand against the present times, and the prevailing wordiness of the
   heretics.  I write this to men of the priestly and monastic Orders, and
   also to the dignitaries and councillors, and to the whole people.  If
   you should approve it, and my vote should prevail, being so just and
   right, and given with God's aid, I am and will be with you in spirit;
   or rather I have already set my hand to the work and am bold in the
   Spirit.  But if you should not agree with me, but determine something
   else, and if the matter is to be settled by cliques and relationships,
   and if the hand of the mob is again to disturb the sincerity of your
   vote, do what pleases you--I shall stay at home.

   Ep. XLIII.  To the Bishops.

   (The comprovincial Bishops had notified the elder Gregory of their
   Synod, but without mentioning its date or purpose or inviting him to
   take part in it--probably because they knew how strongly he would
   support the election of Basil, to which they were unfavourable.  S.
   Gregory therefore wrote the following letter in his father's name.)

   How sweet and kind you are, and how full of love.  You have invited me
   to the Metropolis, because, as I imagine, you are going to take some
   counsel about a Bishop.  So much I learn from you, though you have not
   told me either that I am to be present, or why, or when, but have
   merely announced to me suddenly that you were setting out, as though
   resolved not to respect me, and as not desirous that I should share
   your counsels, but rather putting a hindrance in the way of my coming,
   that you may not meet me even against my will.  This is your way of
   action, and I will put up with the insult, but I will set before you my
   view and how I feel.  Various people will put forward various
   candidates, each according to his own inclinations and interests, as is
   usually the case at such times.  But I cannot prefer anyone, for my
   conscience would not allow it, to my dear son and fellow priest Basil.
   For whom of all my acquaintance do I find more approved in his life, or
   more powerful in his word, or more furnished altogether with the beauty
   of virtue?  But if you allege weak health against him, I reply that we
   are choosing not an athlete but a teacher.  And at the same time is
   seen in this case the power of Him that strengthens and supports the
   weak, if such they be.  If you accept this vote I will come and take
   part, either in spirit or in body.  But if you are marching to a
   foregone conclusion, and faction is to overrule justice, I shall
   rejoice to have been overlooked.  The work must be yours; but pray for
   me. [4738]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4738] There is here a various reading (the difference being merely the
   result of itacism) which seems to give a better sense; "Ours is to pray
   for you."

   Ep. XLII.  To Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata.

   (There still seemed a probability that intrigues and party spirit would
   carry the day, and so the two Gregories determined to call in the aid
   of Eusebius of Samosata, though he did not belong to the Province.  He
   had been a conspicuous champion of orthodoxy against the Arian Emperor
   Valens, and the Gregories hoped much from his presence at the Synod.
   He responded to their appeal, and undertook the three hundred miles of
   very difficult travelling to throw in his influence with the cause
   which they had at heart.  He saw, however, that it was necessary that
   the aged Bishop of Nazianzus, notwithstanding his years and
   infirmities, should make the effort, and he persuaded him to go.  The
   result was all that could be desired; for Basil was elected by a
   unanimous vote.  The letter, which S. Gregory wrote in his own name to
   thank him, will be found later on.)

   O that I had the wings of a dove, or that my old age could be renewed,
   that I might be able to go to your charity, and to satisfy the longings
   that I have to see you, and to tell you the troubles of my soul, and in
   you to find some comfort for my afflictions.  For since the death of
   the blessed Bishop Eusebius I am not a little afraid lest they who on a
   former occasion set traps for our Metropolis, and wanted to fill it
   with heretical tares, should now seize the opportunity, and uproot by
   their evil teaching the piety which has with so much labour been sown
   in the hearts of men, and should tear asunder its unity, as they have
   done in many Churches.  As soon as I received letters from the Clergy
   asking me not to forget them in their present circumstances, I looked
   round about me, and remembered your love and your right faith and the
   zeal with which you are ever possessed for the Churches of God; and
   therefore I sent my beloved Eustathius, my Deacon and helper, to warn
   your Reverence, and to entreat you, in addition to all your toils for
   the Churches, to meet me, and both to refresh my old age by your
   coming, and to establish in the Orthodox Church that piety which is so
   famous, by giving her with us (if we may be deemed worthy to have a
   share with you in the good work) a Shepherd according to the will of
   the Lord, who shall be able to rule His people.  For we have a man
   before our eyes, and you are not unacquainted with him; and if we are
   permitted to obtain him I know that we shall acquire great boldness
   towards God, and shall confer a very great benefit upon the people who
   have called upon our aid.  I beg you again and again to put away all
   delay, and to come to us before the bad weather of the winter sets in.

   Ep. XLV.  To Basil.

   (After the Consecration every one thought that Gregory would at once
   join his friend; and Basil himself much wished for his assistance.  But
   Gregory thought it better to restrain his desire to see his friend
   until jealousies had time to calm down.  So he wrote the following
   letter to explain the reasons for his staying away at this juncture.)

   When I learnt that you had been placed on the lofty throne, and that
   the Spirit had prevailed to publish the candle upon the candlestick,
   which even before shone with no dim light, I was glad, I confess.  Why
   should I not be, seeing as I did that the commonwealth of the Church
   was in sorry plight, and needed such a guiding hand?  Yet I did not run
   to you off hand, nor shall I run to you, not even if you ask me
   yourself.  First, in order that I may be careful of your dignity, and
   that you may not seem to be collecting partisans under the influence of
   bad taste and hot temper, as your calumniators would say; and secondly
   that I may make for myself a reputation for stability, and above
   illwill.  When then will you come, perhaps you will ask, and how long
   will you put it off?  As long as God shall bid me, and until the shadow
   of the present enmity and slander shall have passed away.  For the
   lepers, I well know, will not hold out very long to keep our David out
   of Jerusalem.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XLVI.  To Basil.

   (The new Archbishop seems not to have been satisfied with the reasons
   given in Gregory's last letter; so the latter writes again.)

   How can any affairs of yours be mere grape-gleanings to me, O dear and
   sacred friend?

   "What a word has escaped the fence of your teeth," or how could you
   dare to say such a thing, if I too may be somewhat daring?  How could
   your mind set it going, or your ink write it, or your paper receive it,
   O lectures and Athens and virtues and literary labours!  You almost
   make me write a tragedy by what you have written.  Do you not know me
   or yourself, you eye of the world, and great voice and trumpet and
   palace of learning?  Your affairs trifles to Gregory?  What then on
   earth could any one admire, if Gregory admire not you?  There is one
   spring among the seasons, one sun among the stars, and one heaven that
   embraces all things; and so your voice is unique among all things, if I
   am capable of judging such things, and not deceived by my
   affection--and this I do not think to be the case.  But if it is
   because I do not value you according to your worth that you blame me,
   you must also blame all mankind; for no one else has or will
   sufficiently admire you, unless it be yourself, and your own eloquence,
   at least if it were possible to praise oneself, and if such were the
   custom of our speech.  But if you are accusing me of despising you, why
   not rather of being mad?  Or are you vexed because I am acting like a
   philosopher?  Give me leave to say that this and this alone is higher
   than even your conversation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XLVII.  To Basil.

   (The division of the civil Province of Cappadocia into two Provinces in
   the year 372 was followed by ecclesiastical troubles.  Anthimus, the
   Bishop of Tyana, the civil metropolis of the new division of Cappadocia
   Secunda, maintained that the Ecclesiastical divisions must necessarily
   follow the civil, and by consequence claimed for himself that the
   purely civil action of the State had ipso facto elevated him to the
   dignity of Metropolitan of the new Province; and this pretension was
   supported by the Bishops of that district, who were as a rule not well
   disposed towards the great Archbishop.  The next three letters are
   connected with this dispute.)

   I hear that you are being troubled by this fresh innovation, and are
   being worried by some sophistical and not unusual officiousness on the
   part of those in power; and it is not to be wondered at.  For I was not
   ignorant of their envy, or of the fact that many of those around you
   are making use of you to further their own interests, and are kindling
   the spark of meanness.  I have no fear of seeing you unphilosophically
   affected by your troubles, or in any way unworthy of yourself and me.
   Nay, I think that it is now above all that my Basil will be known, and
   that the philosophy which all your life you have been collecting will
   shew itself, and will overcome the abuse as with a high wave; and that
   you will remain unshaken while others are being troubled.  If you think
   it well, I will come myself and perhaps shall be able to give you some
   assistance by my counsel (if the sea needs water, you do counsel!); but
   in any case I shall derive benefit, and shall learn philosophy by
   bearing my part of the abuse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XLVIII.  To Basil.

   (Shortly after the events described above, Basil determined to
   strengthen his own hands by creating a number of new Bishoprics in the
   disputed Province, to one of which, Sasima, he consecrated Gregory,
   very much against the will of the latter, who felt that he had been
   hardly used, and did not attempt to disguise his reluctance.  See Gen.
   Prolegg. p. 195.)

   Do leave off speaking of me as an ill-educated and uncouth and
   unfriendly man, not even worthy to live, because I have ventured to be
   conscious of the way in which I have been treated.  You yourself would
   admit that I have not done wrong in any other respect, and my own
   conscience does not reproach me with having been unkind to you in
   either great or small matters; and I hope it never may.  I only know
   that I saw that I had been deceived--too late indeed, but I saw it--and
   I throw the blame on your throne, as having on a sudden lifted you
   above yourself; and I am weary of being blamed for faults of yours, and
   of having to make excuses for them to people who know both our former
   and our present relations.  For of all that I have to endure this is
   the most ridiculous or most pitiable thing, that the same person should
   have both to suffer the wrong and to bear the blame, and this is my
   present case.  Different people blame me for different things according
   to the tastes of each, or each man's disposition, or the measure of
   their ill feeling on my account; but the kindest reproach me with
   contempt and disdain, and they throw me on one side after making use of
   me, like the most valueless vessels, or those frames upon which arches
   are built, which after the building is complete are taken down and cast
   aside.  We will let them be and say what they please; no one shall curb
   their freedom of speech.  And do you, as my reward, pay off those
   blessed and empty hopes, which you devised against the evil speakers,
   who accused you of insulting me on pretence of honouring me, as though
   I were lightminded and easily taken in by such treatment.  Now I will
   plainly speak out the state of my mind, and you must not be angry with
   me.  For I will tell you just what I said at the moment of the
   suffering, not in a fit of anger or so much in the sense of
   astonishment at what had happened as to lose my reason or not to know
   what I said.  I will not take up arms, nor will I learn tactics which I
   did not learn in former times, when the occasion seemed more suitable,
   as every one was arming and in frenzy (you know the illness of the
   weak), nor will I face the martial Anthimus, though he be an untimely
   warrior, being myself unarmed and unwarlike, and thus the more exposed
   to wounds.  Fight with him yourself if you wish (for necessity often
   makes warriors even of the weak), or look out for some one to fight
   when he seizes your mules, keeping guard over a defile, and like Amalek
   of old, barring the way against Israel.  Give me before all things
   quiet.  Why should I fight for sucking pigs and fowls, and those not my
   own, as though for souls and canons?  Why should I deprive the
   Metropolis of the celebrated Sasima, or lay bare and unveil the secret
   of your mind, when I ought to join in concealing it?  Do you then play
   the man and be strong and draw all parties to your own conclusion, as
   the rivers do the winter torrents, without regard for friendship or
   intimacy in good, or for the reputation which such a course will bring
   you.  Give yourself up to the Spirit alone.  I shall gain this only
   from your friendship, that I shall learn not to trust in friends, or to
   esteem anything more valuable than God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XLIX.  To Basil.  (The Praises of Quiet.)

   You accuse me of laziness and idleness, because I did not accept your
   Sasima, and because I have not bestirred myself like a Bishop, and do
   not arm you against each other like a bone thrown into the midst of
   dogs.  My greatest business always is to keep free from business.  And
   to give you an idea of one of my good points, so much do I value
   freedom from business, that I think I might even be a standard to all
   men of this kind of magnanimity, and if only all men would imitate me
   the Churches would have no troubles; nor would the faith, which every
   one uses as a weapon in his private quarrels, be pulled in pieces.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. L.  To Basil.

   (At the request of Anthimus it would appear that S. Gregory wrote to S.
   Basil a letter, not now extant, proposing a conference between the
   rival Metropolitans.  Basil took umbrage at the well-meant proposal,
   and wrote a stiff letter to S. Gregory, to which the following is the
   reply.)

   How hotly and like a colt you skip in your letters.  Nor do I wonder
   that when you have just become the property of glory you should wish to
   shew me what you find glory to be, so that you may make yourself more
   majestic, like those painters who picture the seasons.  But, to explain
   the whole matter about the Bishops, and the letter by which you were
   annoyed; what was my starting point, and how far I went, and where I
   stopped, appears to me to be too long a matter for a letter, and to be
   a subject not so much for an apology as for a history.  To explain it
   to you concisely:--the most noble Anthimus came to us with certain
   Bishops, whether to visit my Father (this at least was the pretext), or
   to act as he did act.  He sounded me in many ways and on many subjects;
   dioceses, the marshes of Sasima, my ordination,...flattering,
   questioning, threatening, pleading, blaming, praising, drawing circles
   round himself, as though I ought only to look at him and his new
   Metropolis, as being the greater.  Why, I said, do you draw your line
   to include our city, for we too deem our Church to be really a Mother
   of Churches, and that too from ancient times?  In the end he went away
   without having gained his object, much out of breath, and reproaching
   me with Basilism, as if it were a kind of Philipism.  Do you think I
   did you wrong in this?  And now look at the letter from me, who, you
   say, insulted you.  They fashioned a Synodal summons to me; and when I
   declined it and said that the thing was an insult, they then asked as
   an alternative that through me you should be invited to deliberate upon
   these matters.  This I promised, in order to prevent their first plan
   being carried out; placing the whole matter in your hands, if you
   choose to call them together, and where and when.  And if I have not
   injured you in this, tell me where there is room for injury.  If you
   have to learn this from me, I will read you the letter which Anthimus
   sent me, after invading the marshes, notwithstanding my prohibitions
   and threats, insulting and reviling me, and as it were singing a song
   of triumph over my defeat.  And what reason is there that I should
   offend him for your sake and at the same time displease you, as though
   I were currying favour with him?  You ought to have learnt this first,
   my dear friend; and even if it had been so, you should not have
   insulted me,--if only because I am a Priest.  But if you are very much
   disposed to ostentation and quarrelsomeness, and speak as my
   Superior--as the Metropolitan to an insignificant Suffragan, or even as
   to a Bishop without a See--I too have a little pride to set against
   yours.  That is very easy to anybody, and is perhaps the most suitable
   course.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. LVIII.  To Basil.

   (An attack had been made in Gregory's presence on the orthodoxy of
   Basil in respect of the Deity of God the Holy Ghost; and in this letter
   he gives his friend an account of the way in which he had defended
   him.  Unfortunately Basil was not pleased with the letter, taking it as
   intended to convey reproach under the guise of friendly sympathy.)

   From the first I have taken you, and I take you still, for my guide of
   life and my teacher of the faith, and for every thing honourable that
   can be said; and if any one else praises your merits, he is altogether
   with me, or even behind me, so far am I surpassed by your piety, and so
   thoroughly am I yours.  And no wonder; for the longer the intimacy the
   greater the experience; and where the experience is more abundant the
   testimony is more perfect.  And if I get any profit in life it is from
   your friendship and company.  This is my disposition in regard to these
   matters, and I hope always will be.  What I now write I write
   unwillingly, but still I write it.  Do not be angry with me, or I shall
   be very angry myself, if you do not give me credit for both saying and
   writing it out of goodwill to you.

   Many people have condemned us as not firm in our faith; those, I mean,
   who think and think rightly that we thoroughly agree.  Some openly
   charge us with heresy, others with cowardice; with heresy, those who
   believe that our language is not sound; with cowardice, they who blame
   our reserve.  I need not report what other people say; I will tell you
   what has recently happened.

   There was a party here at which a great many distinguished friends of
   ours were present, and amongst them was a man who wore the name and
   dress which betoken piety (i.e. a Monk).  They had not yet begun to
   drink, but were talking about us, as often happens at such parties, and
   made us rather than anything else the subject of their conversation.
   They admired everything connected with you, and they brought me in as
   professing the same philosophy; and they spoke of our friendship, and
   of Athens, and of our conformity of views and feelings on all points.
   Our Philosopher was annoyed by this.  "What is this, gentlemen?" he
   said, with a very mighty shout, "what liars and flatterers you are.
   You may praise these men for other reasons if you like, and I will not
   contradict you; but I cannot concede to you the most important point,
   their orthodoxy.  Basil and Gregory are falsely praised; the former,
   because his words are a betrayal of the faith, the latter, because his
   toleration aids the treason."

   What is this, said I, O vain man and new Dathan and Abiram in folly?
   Where do you come from to lay down the law for us?  How do you set
   yourself up as a judge of such great matters?  "I have just come," he
   replied, "from the festival of the Martyr Eupsychius [4739] , (and so
   it really was), and there I heard the great Basil speak most
   beautifully and perfectly upon the Godhead of the Father and the Son,
   as hardly anyone else could speak; but he slurred over the Spirit."
   And he added a sort of illustration from rivers, which pass by rocks
   and hollow out sand.  "As for you my good sir," he said, looking at me,
   "you do now express yourself openly on the Godhead of the Spirit," and
   he referred to some remarks of mine in speaking of God at a largely
   attended Synod, as having added in respect of the Spirit that
   expression which has made a noise, (how long shall we hide the candle
   under the bushel?) "but the other man hints obscurely, and as it were,
   merely suggests the doctrine, but does not openly speak out the truth;
   flooding people's ears with more policy than piety, and hiding his
   duplicity by the power of his eloquence."

   "It is," I said, "because I (living as I do in a corner, and unknown to
   most men who do not know what I say, and hardly that I speak at all)
   can philosophize without danger; but his word is of greater weight,
   because he is better known, both on his own account and on that of his
   Church.  And everything that he says is public, and the war around him
   is great, as the heretics try to snatch every naked word from Basil's
   lips, to get him expelled from the Church; because he is almost the
   only spark of truth left and the vital force, all else around having
   been destroyed; so that evil may be rooted in the city, and may spread
   over the whole world as from a centre in that Church.  Surely then it
   is better to use some reserve in the truth, and ourselves to give way a
   little to circumstances as to a cloud, rather than by the openness of
   the proclamation to risk its destruction.  For no harm will come to us
   if we recognize the Spirit as God from other phrases which lead to this
   conclusion (for the truth consists not so much in sound as in sense),
   but a very great injury would be done to the Church if the truth were
   driven away in the person of one man."  The company present would not
   receive my economy, as out of date and mocking them; but they shouted
   me down as practising it rather from cowardice than for reason.  It
   would be much better, they said, to protect our own people by the
   truth, than by your so-called Economy to weaken them while failing to
   win over the others.  It would be a long business and perhaps
   unnecessary to tell you all the details of what I said, and of what I
   heard, and how vexed I was with the opponents, perhaps immoderately and
   contrary to my own usual temper.  But, in fine, I sent them away in the
   same fashion.  But do you O divine and sacred head, instruct me how far
   I ought to go in setting forth the Deity of the Spirit; and what words
   I ought to use, and how far to use reserve; that I may be furnished
   against opponents.  For if I, who more than any one else know both you
   and your opinions, and have often both given and received assurance on
   this point, still need to be taught the truth of this matter, I shall
   be of all men the most ignorant and miserable.

   Ep. LIX.  To Basil.

   (The reply to Basil's somewhat angry answer to the last.)

   This was a case which any wiser man would have foreseen; but I who am
   very simple and foolish did not fear it in writing to you.  My letter
   grieved you; but in my opinion neither rightly nor justly, but quite
   unreasonably.  And whilst you did not acknowledge that you were hurt,
   neither did you conceal it, or if you did it was with great skill, as
   with a mask, hiding your vexation under an appearance of respect.  But
   as to myself if I acted in this deceitfully or maliciously, I shall be
   punished not more by your vexation than by the truth itself; but if in
   simplicity and with my accustomed goodwill, I will lay the blame on my
   own sins rather than on your temper.  But it would have been better to
   have set this matter straight, rather than to be angry with those who
   offer you counsel.  But you must see to your own affairs, inasmuch as
   you are quite capable of giving the same advice to others.  You may
   look upon me as very ready, if God will, both to come to you, and to
   join you in the conflict, and to contribute all that I can.  For who
   would flinch, who would not rather take courage in speaking and
   contending for the truth under you and by your side?

   Ep. LX.  To Basil.

   (Gregory was not able, owing to the serious illness of his Mother, to
   carry out the promise at the end of Ep. LIX.; so he writes to explain
   and excuse himself.)

   The Carrying Out of your bidding depends partly on me; but partly, and
   I venture to think principally, on your Reverence.  What depends on me
   is the good will and eagerness, for I never yet avoided meeting you,
   but have always sought opportunities, and at the present moment am even
   more desirous of doing so.  What depends on your Holiness is that my
   affairs be set straight.  For I am sitting by my lady Mother, who has
   for a long time been suffering from illness.  And if I could leave her
   out of danger you might be well assured that I would not deprive myself
   of the pleasure of going to you.  So give me the help of your prayers
   for her restoration to health, and for my journey to you.

   Miscellaneous Letters.

   §1.  Letters to His Brother Cæsarius.

   Ep. VII.

   (On the death of the Emperor Constantius the undisputed succession
   devolved on his cousin Julian the Apostate, who at once began to employ
   all the power of the Empire to discourage, while not absolutely
   persecuting, Christianity, and to restore the supremacy of the ancient
   Paganism.  One of his first acts was to dismiss all the men who had
   held high dignities under his predecessor.  S. Cæsarius, Gregory's
   brother, was however to be excepted; Julian, who had perhaps known and
   esteemed him at Athens, did all that he could to keep him at Court, and
   to attach him to himself.  This caused much anxiety to Gregory and
   other friends of Cæsarius, who foresaw that Julian would do his utmost
   to shake the young man's faith, and could not feel sure that he would
   have courage to resist such assaults.  In his trouble Gregory wrote him
   the following letter.  Shortly afterwards the expected attempt was
   made.  S. Cæsarius bravely held his ground against the Emperor, and
   after declaring his unalterable determination to hold firm to his
   faith, resigned his office at Court and withdrew to Nazianzus.)

   I have had enough to blush for in you; that I was grieved, it is hardly
   necessary to say to him who of all men knows me best.  But, not to
   speak of my own feelings, or of the distress with which the rumour
   about you filled me (and let me say also the fear), I should have liked
   you, had it been possible, to have heard what was said by others, both
   relations and outsiders, who are any way acquainted with us (Christians
   I mean, of course,) about you and me; and not only some of them, but
   everyone in turn alike; for men are always more ready to philosophize
   about strangers than about their own relations.  Such speeches as the
   following have become a sort of exercise among them:  Now a Bishop's
   son takes service in the army; now he covets exterior power and fame;
   now he is a slave of money, when the fire is being rekindled for all,
   and men are running the race for life; and he does not deem the one
   only glory and safety and wealth to be to stand nobly against the
   times, and to place himself as far as possible out of reach of every
   abomination and defilement.  How then can the Bishop exhort others not
   to be carried along with the times, or to be mixed up with idols?  How
   can he rebuke those who do wrong in other ways, seeing his own home
   takes away his right to speak freely?  We have every day to hear this,
   and even more severe things, some of the speakers perhaps saying them
   from a motive of friendship, and others with unfriendly feelings.  How
   do you think we feel, and what is the state of mind with which we, men
   professing to serve God, and to deem the only good to be to look
   forward to the hopes of the future, hear such things as these?  Our
   venerable Father is very much distressed by all that he hears, which
   even disgusts him with life.  I console and comfort him as best I can,
   by making myself surety for your mind, and assuring him that you will
   not continue thus to grieve us.  But if our dear Mother were to hear
   about you (so far we have kept her in the dark by various devices), I
   think she would be altogether inconsolable; being, as a woman, of a
   weak mind, and besides unable, through her great piety, to control her
   feelings on such matters.  If then you care at all for yourself and us,
   try some better and safer course.  Our means are certainly enough for
   an independent life, at least for a man of moderate desires, who is not
   insatiable in his lust for more.  Moreover, I do not see what occasion
   for your settling down we are to wait for, if we let this one pass.
   But if you cling to the same opinion, and every thing seems to you of
   small account in comparison with your own desires, I do not wish to say
   anything else that may vex you, but this I foretell and protest, that
   one of two things must happen; either you, remaining a genuine
   Christian, will be ranked among the lowest, and will be in a position
   unworthy of yourself and your hopes; or in grasping at honours you will
   injure yourself in what is more important, and will have a share in the
   smoke, if not actually in the fire.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XIV. and XXIII.

   (Under the Emperor Valens Cæsarius returned to public life and was made
   Quæstor of Bithynia.  While he was in this office the following letters
   were written to him by his brother on behalf of two cousins, Eulalius,
   who afterwards succeeded Gregory in the Bishopric of Nazianzus, and
   with whom Gregory was on terms of intimate friendship, and
   Amphilochius, who, through the roguery of a partner, had got into some
   trouble at Constantinople about money matters, and for whom he asks aid
   and advice.  Some however think that this letter is not addressed to
   his brother (who may have been at Constantinople at the time), but to
   some other officer of high rank at the Imperial Court.  Amphilochius
   soon after retired from the world, and by a.d. 347 was already bishop
   of the important See of Iconium.  Gregory's letters to him are given
   later in this division.)

   Do a kindness to yourself and to me, of a kind that you will not often
   have an opportunity of doing, because opportunities for such kindnesses
   do not often occur.  Undertake a most righteous protection of my dear
   cousins, who are worried more than enough about a property which they
   bought as suitable for retirement, and capable of providing them with
   some means of living; but after having completed the purchase they have
   fallen into many troubles, partly through finding the vendors
   dishonest, and partly through being plundered and robbed by their
   neighbours, so that it would be a gain to them to get rid of their
   acquisition for the price they gave for it, plus the not small sum they
   have spent on it besides.  If, then, you would like to transfer the
   business to yourself, after examining the contract to see how it may be
   best and most securely done, this course would be most acceptable both
   to them and me; but if you would rather not, the next best course would
   be to oppose yourself to the officiousness and dishonesty of the man,
   that he may not succeed in gaining one advantage over their want of
   business habits, either by wronging them if they retain their property,
   or by inflicting loss upon them if they part with it.  I am really
   ashamed to write to you on such a subject.  All the same, since we owe
   it to them, on account both of their relationship and of their
   profession (for of whom would one rather take care than of such, or
   what would one be more ashamed of than of being unwilling to confer
   such a benefit?) do you either for your own sake, or for mine, or for
   the sake of the men themselves, or for all these sakes put together, by
   all means do them this kindness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXIII.

   Do not be surprized if I ask of you a great favour; for it is from a
   great man that I am asking it, and the request must be measured by him
   of whom it is made; for it is equally absurd to ask great things from a
   small man, and small things from a great man, the one being
   unseasonable, and the other mean.  I therefore present to you with my
   own hand my most precious son Amphilochius, a man so famous (even
   beyond his years) for his gentlemanly bearing, that I myself, though an
   old man, and a Priest, and your friend, would be quite content to be as
   much esteemed.  What wonder is it if he was cheated by a man's
   pretended friendship, and did not suspect the swindle?  For not being
   himself a rogue, he did not suspect roguery, but thought that
   correction of language rather than of character was what was wanted,
   and therefore entered into partnership with him in business.  What
   blame can attach to him for this with honest men?  Do not then allow
   wickedness to get the better of virtue; and do not dishonour my grey
   hairs, but do honour to my testimony, and add your kindness to my
   benedictions, which are perhaps of some account with God before Whom we
   stand.

   Ep. XX.

   (In a.d. 368 the City of Nicæa in Bithynia was almost entirely
   destroyed by a terrible earthquake.  Cæsarius lost his house, and his
   personal escape was almost miraculous.  Gregory writes (as also did
   Basil) to congratulate him on his escape, and profits by the occasion
   to urge upon him retirement from his secular avocations.  Cæsarius soon
   resolved to follow this advice, and was taking steps to carry this
   resolution into effect, when he died suddenly, early in a.d. 369, aged
   only 40.  He left the whole of his large property to the poor, but it
   fell for a time into the hands of designing persons, and Gregory, who
   was his brother's executor, had much difficulty in recovering it for
   the purpose for which it had been intended.  (See the letter to
   Sophronius, Prefect of Constantinople on this subject.)  He was buried
   at Nazianzus in the Church of the Martyrs, in a vault which his parents
   had prepared for themselves.  Gregory preached the funeral sermon,
   which is given in the former part of this volume.  These four are the
   only letters known to have passed between the brothers.)

   Even frights are not without use to the wise; or, as I should say, they
   are very valuable and salutary.  For, although we pray that they may
   not happen, yet when they do they instruct us.  For the afflicted soul,
   as Peter [4740] somewhere admirably says, is near to God; and every man
   who escapes a danger is brought into nearer relation to Him Who
   preserved him.  Let us not then be vexed that we had a share in the
   calamity, but let us give thanks that we were delivered.  And let us
   not shew ourselves one thing to God in the time of peril, and another
   when the danger is over, but let us resolve, whether at home or abroad,
   whether in private life or in public office (for I must say this and
   may not omit it), to follow Him Who has preserved us, and to attach
   ourselves to His side, thinking little of the little concerns of earth;
   and let us furnish a tale to those who come after us, great for our
   glory and the benefit of our soul, and at the same time a very useful
   lesson to all, that danger is better than security, and that misfortune
   is preferable to success, at least if before our fears we belonged to
   the world, but after them we belong to God.  Perhaps I seem to you
   somewhat of a bore, by writing to you so often on the same subject, and
   you will think my letter a piece not of exhortation but of ostentation,
   so enough of this.  You will know that I desire and wish especially
   that I might be with you and share your joy at your preservation, and
   to talk over these matters later on.  But since that cannot be, I hope
   to receive you here as soon as may be, and to celebrate our
   thanksgiving together.

   §2.  To S. Gregory of Nyssa.

   (Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, was a younger brother of Basil the Great.
   Ordained a Reader at an early age he grew tired of his vocation, and
   became a professor of Rhetoric.  This gave scandal in the Church and
   occasioned much grief to his friends.  Gregory of Nazianzus, wrote him
   the following letter of remonstrance, which was not without effect, for
   shortly afterwards he gave up his secular avocation, and retired to the
   Monastery which his brother Basil had founded in Pontus.  Here he spent
   several years in the study of Holy Scripture and the best
   Commentators.)

   Ep. I.

   There is one good point in my character, and I will boast myself of one
   point out of many.  I am equally vexed with myself and my friends over
   a bad plan.  Since, then, all are friends and kinsfolk who live
   according to God, and walk by the same Gospel, why should you not hear
   from me in plain words what all men are saying in whispers?  They do
   not approve your inglorious glory (to borrow a phrase from your own
   art), and your gradual descent to the lower life, and your ambition,
   the worst of demons, according to Euripides. [4741]   For what has
   happened to you, O wisest of men, and for what do you condemn yourself,
   that you have cast away the sacred and delightful books which you used
   once to read to the people (do not be ashamed to hear this), or have
   hung them up over the chimney, as men do in winter with rudders and
   hoes, and have applied yourself to salt and bitter ones, and preferred
   to be called a Professor of Rhetoric rather than of Christianity?  I,
   thank God, would rather be the latter than the former.  Do not, my dear
   friend, do not let this be longer the case, but, though it is full
   late, become sober again, and come to yourself once more, and make your
   apology to the faithful, and to God, and to His Altars and Sacraments,
   from which you have withdrawn yourself.  And do not say to me in proud
   rhetorical style, What, was I not a Christian when I practised
   rhetoric?  Was I not a believer when I was engaged among the boys?  And
   perhaps you will call God to witness.  No, my friend, not as thoroughly
   as you ought to have been, even if I grant it you in part.  What of the
   offence to others given by your present employment--to others who are
   prone naturally to evil--and of the opportunity afforded them both to
   think and to speak the worst of you?  Falsely, I grant, but where was
   the necessity?  For a man lives not for himself alone but also for his
   neighbour; nor is it enough to persuade yourself, you must persuade
   others also.  If you were to practise boxing in public, or to give and
   receive blows in the theatre, or to writhe and twist yourself
   shamefully, would you speak of yourself as having a temperate soul?
   Such an argument does not befit a wise man; it is frivolous to accept
   it.  If you make a change I shall rejoice even now, said one of the
   Pythagorean philosophers, lamenting the fall of a friend; but, he
   wrote, if not you are dead to me.  But I will not yet say this for your
   sake.  Being a friend, he became an enemy, yet still a friend, as the
   Tragedy says.  But I shall be grieved (to speak gently), if you do
   neither yourself see what is right, which is the highest method of all,
   nor will follow the advice of others, which is the next.  Thus far my
   counsel.  Forgive me that my friendship for you makes me grieve, and
   kindles me both on your behalf and on behalf of the whole priestly
   Order, and I may add on that of all Christians.  And if I may pray with
   you or for you, may God who quickeneth the dead aid your weakness.

   Ep. LXXII.

   (When S. Gregory was consecrated Bishop of Nyssa the Imperial Throne
   was occupied by Valens, an ardent Arian, whose mind was bent on the
   destruction of the Nicene Faith.  He appointed, with this object, one
   Demosthenes, a former clerk of the Imperial Kitchen, to be Vicar of the
   civil Diocese of Pontus.  An old quarrel with Basil had made this man
   unfriendly to Gregory, and after persecuting him in various small ways
   for some time he procured, a.d. 275, the summoning of a Synod to
   enquire into some allegations of irregularity in his consecration, and
   to try Gregory on some frivolous charges of malversation of Church
   funds.  Gregory was unable to attend this Synod, which met at Ancyra,
   on account of an attack of pleurisy; and another was summoned to meet
   at Nyssa itself.  Gregory however refused to appear, and was deposed as
   contumacious.  Thereupon Valens banished him, and he seems to have
   fallen into very low spirits, almost into despondency at the apparent
   triumph of the heretical party.  The three letters which follow throw
   some light upon his state at this time.  They were written in answer to
   letters of his now lost, and their object was to comfort him in his
   trouble and to encourage him to take heart again in the hope of a good
   day coming.  This more cheerful tone was justified by the event, for on
   the death of Valens, a.d. 378, the exiled Bishops were restored by
   Gratian, and Gregory was replaced in his Episcopal Throne, to the great
   joy of the faithful of his Diocese.)

   Do not let your troubles distress you too much.  For the less we grieve
   over things, the less grievous they are.  It is nothing strange that
   the heretics have thawed, and are taking courage from the springtime,
   and creeping out of their holes, as you write.  They will hiss for a
   short time, I know, and then will hide themselves again, overcome both
   by the truth and the times, and all the more so the more we commit the
   whole matter to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. LXXIII.

   As to the subject of your letter, these are my sentiments.  I am not
   angry at being overlooked, but I am glad when I am honoured.  The one
   is my own desert, the other is a proof of your respect.  Pray for me.
   Excuse this short letter, for anyhow, though it is short, it is longer
   than silence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. LXXIV.

   Although I am at home, my love is expatriated with you, for affection
   makes us have all things common.  Trusting in the mercy of God, and in
   your prayers, I have great hopes that all will turn out according to
   your mind, and that the hurricane will be turned into a gentle breeze,
   and that God will give you this reward for your orthodoxy, that you
   will overcome your opponents.  Most of all I long to see you shortly,
   and to have a good time with you, as I pray.  But if you delay owing to
   the pressure of affairs, at any rate cheer me by a letter, and do not
   disdain to tell me all about your circumstances, and to pray for me, as
   you are accustomed to do.  May God grant you health and good spirits in
   all circumstances,--you who are the common prop of the whole Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. LXXVI.

   (Basil the Great died Jan. 1, a.d. 379.  Gregory of Nazianzus was
   prevented by very serious illness from attending his funeral, and
   therefore wrote as follows to Gregory of Nyssa.)

   This, then, was also reserved for my sad life, to hear of the death of
   Basil, and the departure of that holy soul, which has gone from us that
   it may be with the Lord, for which he had been preparing himself all
   his life.  And among all the other losses I have had to endure this is
   the greatest, that by reason of the bodily sickness from which I am
   still suffering and in great danger, I cannot kiss that holy dust, or
   be with you to enjoy the consolations of a just philosophy, and to
   comfort our common friends.  But to see the desolation of the Church,
   shorn of such a glory, and bereft of such a crown, is what no one, at
   least no one of any feeling, can bear to let his eyes look upon, or his
   ear hearken to.  But you, I think, though you have many friends and
   will receive many words of condolence, yet will not derive comfort so
   much from any as from yourself and your memory of him; for you two were
   a pattern to all of philosophy, a kind of spiritual standard, both of
   discipline in prosperity, and of endurance in adversity; for philosophy
   bears prosperity with moderation and adversity with dignity.  This is
   what I have to say to Your Excellency.  But for myself who write so,
   what time or what words shall comfort me, except your company and
   conversation, which our blessed one has left me in place of all, that
   seeing his character in you as in a bright and shining mirror, I may
   think myself to possess him also!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. LXXXI.

   You are distressed by your travels, and think yourself unsteady, like a
   stick carried along by a stream.  But, my dear friend, you must not let
   yourself feel so at all.  For the travels of the stick are involuntary,
   but your course is ordained by God, and your stability is in doing good
   to others, even though you are not fixed to a place; unless indeed one
   ought to find fault with the sun, for going about the world scattering
   his rays, and giving life to all things on which he shines; or, while
   praising the fixed stars, one should revile the planets, whose very
   wandering is harmonious.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. CLXXXII.

   (Gregory after his resignation of the Patriarchal See of Constantinople
   had retired to Nazianzus, and had been persuaded to undertake the
   administration of the diocese then vacant, until the vacancy should be
   filled.  The Bishops of the Province wished him to retain it
   altogether, and therefore were in no hurry to proceed to election.  At
   length however they yielded to the continually expressed wishes of
   Gregory and chose his cousin Eulalius.  Soon however Gregory's enemies
   spread abroad a report that this election had been made against his
   wishes, and with the intention of unfairly ousting him from the
   administration of that Church.  The following letter was written in
   consequence of this slander.)

   Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged, and, which is the greatest
   of my misfortunes, that war and dissensions are among us, and that we
   have not kept the peace which we received from our holy fathers.  This
   I doubt not you will restore, in the power of the Spirit who upholds
   you and yours.  But let no one, I beg, spread false reports about me
   and my lords the bishops, as though they had proclaimed another bishop
   in my place against my will.  But being in great need, owing to my
   feeble health, and fearing the responsibility of a Church neglected, I
   asked this favour of them, which was not opposed to the Canon Law, and
   was a relief to me, that they would give a Pastor to the Church.  He
   has been given to your prayers, a man worthy of your piety, and I now
   place him in your hands, the most reverend Eulalius, a bishop very dear
   to God, in whose arms I should like to die.  If any be of opinion that
   it is not right to ordain another in the lifetime of a Bishop, let him
   know that he will not in this matter gain any hold upon us.  For it is
   well known that I was appointed, not to Nazianzus, but to Sasima,
   although for a short time out of reverence for my father, I as a
   stranger undertook the government.

   Ep. CXCVII.  A Letter of Condolence on the Death of His Sister
   Theosebia.

   (The writer of the article on Gregory Nyssen in the Dict. Biogr.
   supposes her to have been his wife, but produces no evidence of this
   beyond the ambiguous expression in this letter which speaks of her as
   "the true consort of a priest," but on the other hand she is expressly
   called his Sister in the same letter.  Some writers have imagined that
   she was the wife of Gregory Nazianzen himself, but there is no evidence
   to show that he was ever married.  The date of her death is uncertain,
   but it was probably subsequent to a.d. 381.  It would seem that the
   term Consort might have a general application to those who shared in
   the same work, and consequently the Benedictine Editors regard
   Theosebia as a Deaconess of the Church of Nyssa.)

   I had started in all haste to go to you, and had got as far as
   Euphemias, when I was delayed by the festival which you are celebrating
   in honour of the Holy Martyrs; partly because I could not take part in
   it, owing to my bad health, partly because my coming at so unsuitable a
   time might be inconvenient to you.  I had started partly for the sake
   of seeing you after so long, and partly that I might admire your
   patience and philosophy (for I had heard of it) at the departure of
   your holy and blessed sister, as a good and perfect man, a minister of
   God, who knows better than any the things both of God and man; and who
   regards as a very light thing that which to others would be most heavy,
   namely to have lived with such a soul, and to send her away and store
   her up in the safe garners, like a shock of the threshingfloor gathered
   in due season, [4742] to use the words of Holy Scripture; and that in
   such time that she, having tasted the joys of life, escaped its sorrows
   through the shortness of her life; and before she had to wear mourning
   for you, was honoured by you with that fair funeral honour which is due
   to such as she.  I too, believe me, long to depart, if not as you do,
   which were much to say, yet only less than you.  But what must we feel
   in presence of a long prevailing law of God which has now taken my
   Theosebia (for I call her mine because she lived a godly life; for
   spiritual kindred is better than bodily), Theosebia, the glory of the
   church, the adornment of Christ, the helper of our generation, the hope
   of woman; Theosebia, the most beautiful and glorious among all the
   beauty of the Brethren; Theosebia, truly sacred, truly consort of a
   priest, and of equal honour and worthy of the Great Sacraments, [4743]
   Theosebia, whom all future time shall receive, resting on immortal
   pillars, that is, on the souls of all who have known her now, and of
   all who shall be hereafter.  And do not wonder that I often invoke her
   name.  For I rejoice even in the remembrance of the blessed one.  Let
   this, a great deal in few words, be her epitaph from me, and my word of
   condolence for you, though you yourself are quite able to console
   others in this way through your philosophy in all things.  Our meeting
   (which I greatly long for) is prevented by the reason I mentioned.  But
   we pray with one another as long as we are in the world, until the
   common end, to which we are drawing nigh, overtake us.  Wherefore we
   must bear all things, since we shall not for long have either to
   rejoice or to suffer.

   §3.  To Eusebius Bishop of Samosata.

   Ep. XLII.

   (This letter, urging his friend to attend at Cæsarea for the election
   of a Metropolitan in succession to Eusebius, has been already given in
   the second division of this Selection.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XLIV.

   (Eusebius, having in response to the appeal referred to above, betaken
   himself to Cæsarea, the Elder Gregory, though in very feeble health,
   resolved to attend the Synod in person, that Basil's Election might be
   secured by their joint exertions, Gregory the Younger sent the
   following letter by his father to explain to his friend the reason why
   he had not come too.  The date is about September of the year 379.)

   Whence shall I begin your praises, and by what name shall I give you
   your right appellation?  The pillar and ground of the church, or a
   light in the world, using the very words of the apostle, or a crown of
   glory to the remaining portion of christendom; [4744] or a gift of God,
   or the bulwark of your country, or the standard of faith, or the
   ambassador of truth, or all these at once, and more than all?  And
   these excessive praises I will prove by what we shall see.  What rain
   ever came so seasonably to a thirsty land, what water flowing out of
   the rock to those in the wilderness?  What such Bread of Angels did
   ever man eat?  When did Jesus the common Lord ever so seasonably
   present Himself to His drowning disciples, and tame the sea, and save
   the perishing, as you have shewn yourself to us in our weariness and
   distress, and in our immediate danger as it were of shipwreck?  I need
   not speak of other points, with what courage and joy you filled the
   souls of the orthodox, and how many you delivered from despair.

   But our mother church, Cæsarea I mean, is now really putting off the
   garments of her widowhood at the sight of you, and putting on again her
   robe of cheerfulness, and will be yet more resplendent when she
   receives a pastor worthy of herself and of her former Bishops and of
   your hands.  For you yourself see what is the state of our affairs, and
   what a miracle your zeal has wrought, and your toil, and your godly
   plainness of speech.  Age is renewed, disease is conquered, [4745] they
   leap who were in their beds, and the weak are girded with power.  By
   all this I guess that our matters too will turn out as we desire.  You
   have my father, moreover, representing both himself and me, to put a
   glorious close to his whole life and to his venerable age by this
   present struggle on behalf of the Church.  And I shall receive him
   back, I am well assured, strengthened by your prayers, and with youth
   renewed, for one must confidently commit all in faith to them.  But if
   he should end his life in this anxiety, it would be no calamity to
   attain to such an end in such a cause.  Pardon me, I beg of you, if I
   give way a little to the tongues of evil men, and delay a little to
   come and embrace you, and to complete in person what I now pass over of
   the praises due to you.

   Ep. LXIV.

   (In the year 374 Eusebius and other orthodox Bishops of the East were
   banished by Valens and their thrones filled with Arian intruders.
   Eusebius was ordered to retire to Thrace, and his journey lay through
   Cappadocia, where he saw Basil, but Gregory to his great grief was too
   unwell to leave his house and go to meet him.  Instead he sent the
   following letter.)

   When Your Reverence was passing through our country I was so ill as not
   to be able even to look out of my house.  And I was grieved not so much
   on account of the illness, though it brought about the fear of the
   worst, as by the inability to meet your holiness and goodness.  My
   longing to see your venerable face was like that which a man would
   naturally feel who needed healing of spiritual wounds, and expected to
   receive it from you.  But though at that time the effect of my sins was
   that I missed the meeting with you, it is now by your goodness possible
   for me to find a remedy for my trouble, for if you will deign to
   remember me in your acceptable prayers, this will be to me a store of
   every blessing from God, both in this my life and in the age to come.
   For that such a man, such a combatant for the Faith of the Gospel, one
   who has endured such persecutions, and won for himself such confidence
   before the all-righteous God by his patience in tribulation--that such
   a man should deign to be my patron also in his prayers will gain for
   me, I am persuaded, as much strength as I should have gained through
   one of the holy martyrs.  Therefore let me entreat you to remember your
   Gregory without ceasing in all the matters in which I desire to be
   worthy of your remembrance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. LXV.

   (Eusebius having replied to the former letter Gregory wrote again,
   having an opportunity of communicating with his friend through one
   Eupraxius, a disciple of Eusebius, who passed through Cappadocia on his
   way to visit his master.  This letter is sometimes attributed to
   Basil.)

   Our reverend brother Eupraxius has always been dear to me and a true
   friend, but he has shewn himself dearer and truer through his
   affections for you, inasmuch as even at the present time he has hurried
   to your reverence, like, to use David's words, a hart to quench his
   great and unendurable thirst [4746] with a sweet and pure spring at
   your patience in tribulations.  Deign then to be his patron and mine.

   Happy indeed are they who are permitted to come near you, and happier
   still is he who can place upon his sufferings for Christ's sake and
   upon his labours for the truth, a crown such as few of those who fear
   God have obtained.  For it is not an untested virtue that you have
   shown, nor is it only, in a time of calm that you have sailed aright
   and steered the souls of others, but you have shone in the difficulties
   of temptations, and have been greater than your persecutors, having
   nobly departed from the land of your birth.  Others possess the
   threshold of their fathers,--we the heavenly City; others perhaps hold
   our throne, but we Christ.  O what a profitable exchange!  How little
   we give up, to receive how much!  We went through fire and water, and I
   believe that we shall also come out into a place of refreshment.  For
   God will not forsake us for ever, or abandon the true faith to
   persecution, but according to the multitude of our pains His comforts
   shall make us glad.  This at any rate we believe and desire.  But do
   you, I beg, pray for our humility.  And as often as occasion shall
   present itself bless us without hesitation by a letter, and cheer us up
   by news of yourself, as you have just been good enough to do.

   Ep. LXVI.

   (The following letter is sometimes attributed to Basil, and is found in
   his works as well as in those of Gregory.  The mss. however, with only
   a single exception, give it to the latter.)

   You give me pleasure both by writing and remembering me, and a much
   greater pleasure by sending me your blessing in your letter.  But if I
   were worthy of your sufferings and of your conflicts for Christ and
   through Christ I should have been counted worthy also to come to you,
   to embrace Your Piety, and to take example by your patience in your
   sufferings.  But since I am not worthy of this, being troubled with
   many afflictions and hindrances I do what is next best.  I address Your
   Perfection, and I beg you not to be weary of remembering me.  For to be
   deemed worthy of your letters is not only profitable to me, but is also
   a matter to boast of to many people, and is an honour, because I am
   considered by a man of so great virtue, and such near relations with
   God, that he can bring others also by word and example into relation to
   Him.

   §4.  To Sophronius, Prefect of Constantinople.

   (Sophronius, a native of the Cappadocian Cæsarea, was an early friend
   and fellow-student of Gregory and Basil.  He entered the Civil Service,
   and soon rose to high office.  In a.d. 365 he was appointed Prefect of
   Constantinople, as a reward for timely intimation which he gave to the
   Emperor Valens of the usurpation attempted by Procopius.  He is chiefly
   known to us by the letters of Gregory and Basil, invoking his good
   offices for various persons.  Ep. 21 was written in a.d. 369 to commend
   to him Nicobulus, Gregory's nephew by marriage, the husband of
   Alypiana, daughter of his sister Gorgonia.  This Nicobulus was a man of
   great wealth and ability, but much disinclined for public life.
   Gregory constantly writes to one and another high official to get him
   excused from appointments which had been thrust upon him.)

   Ep. XXI.

   Gold is changed and transformed into various forms at various times,
   being fashioned into many ornaments, and used by art for many purposes;
   yet it remains what it is--gold; and it is not the substance but the
   form which admits of change.  So also, believing that your kindness
   will remain unchanged for your friends, although you are ever climbing
   higher, I have ventured to send you this request, because I do not more
   reverence your high rank than I trust your kind disposition.  I entreat
   you to be favourable to my most respectable son Nicobulus, who is in
   all respects allied with me, both by kindred and by intimacy, and,
   which is more important, by disposition.  In what matters, and to what
   extent?  In whatever he may ask your aid, and as far as may seem to you
   to befit your Magnanimity.  I on my part will repay you the best I
   have.  I have the power of speech, and of proclaiming your goodness, if
   not nearly according to its worth, at any rate to the best of my
   ability.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXII.

   (Is for Amphilochius, written at the same time and in consequence of
   the same trouble as that which we have placed second of the letters to
   Cæsarius.)

   As we know gold and stones by their look, so too we may distinguish
   good men from bad in the same way, and do not need a very long trial.
   For I should not have needed many words in pleading for my most
   honourable son Amphilochius with Your Magnanimity.  I should rather
   have expected some strange and incredible thing to happen than that he
   would do anything dishonourable, or think of such a thing, in a matter
   of money; such a universal reputation has he as a gentleman, and as
   wiser than his years.  But what must he suffer?  Nothing escapes envy,
   for some word of blame has touched even him, a man who has fallen under
   accusation of crime through simplicity rather than depravity of
   disposition.  But do not allow it to be tolerable to you to overlook
   him in his vexations and trouble.  Not so, I entreat your sacred and
   great mind, but honour your country [4747] and aid his virtue, and have
   a respect for me who have attained to glory by and through you; and be
   everything to this man, adding the will to the power, for I know that
   there is nothing of equal power with Your Excellency.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXIX.

   (Of the same year.  Here Cæsarius had bequeathed all his property to
   the poor; but his house had been looted by his servants, and his
   friends could only find a comparatively small sum.  Besides this a
   number of persons, shortly afterwards, presented themselves as
   creditors of his estate, and their claims, though incapable of proof,
   were paid.  Then others kept coming forward, until at last the family
   refused to admit any more.  Then a lawsuit was threatened.  Gregory
   intensely disliking all this, and dreading moreover the scandal which
   might be caused by legal proceedings, writes as follows to the
   Prefect.)

   You see how matters stand with me, and how the circle of human affairs
   goes round, now some now others flourishing or the reverse, and neither
   prosperity nor adversity remaining constant with us, as the saying is,
   but ever changing and altering, so that one might trust the breezes, or
   letters written in the waters, rather than human prosperity.  For what
   reason is this?  I think it is in order that by the contemplation of
   the uncertainty and anomaly of all these things we may learn the rather
   to have recourse to God and to the future, giving scanty thoughts to
   shadows and dreams.  But what has produced this talk, for it is not
   without a cause that I thus philosophize, and I am not idly boasting?

   Cæsarius was once one of your not least distinguished friends; indeed,
   unless my brotherly affection deceives me, he was one of your most
   distinguished, for he was remarkably well informed, and for gentlemanly
   conduct was above the average, and was celebrated for the number of his
   friends; among the very first of these, as he always thought and as he
   persuaded me, Your Excellency held the first place.  These are old
   stories, and you will add to them of your own accord in rendering
   honours to his memory; for it is human nature to add something to the
   praises of the departed.  But now (that you may not pass over this
   story without a tear, or that you may weep to some good and useful
   purpose), he lies dead, friendless, solitary, pitiable, deemed worthy
   of a little myrrh (if even of so much), and of the last small
   coverings, and it is much that he has found even thus much compassion.
   But his enemies, as I hear, have fallen upon his estate, and from all
   quarters with great violence are plundering it, or are about to do so.
   O cruelty!  O savagery!  And there is no one to hinder them; but even
   the kindest of his friends only calls upon the laws as his utmost
   favour.  If I may put it concisely, I am become a mere drama, who once
   was wont to be happy.  Do not let this seem to you to be tolerable, but
   help me by sympathy and by sharing my indignation, and do right by the
   dead Cæsarius.  Yes, in the name of friendship herself; yes, by all
   that you hold dearest; by your hope (which may you make secure by
   shewing yourself faithful and true to the departed), I pray you do this
   kindness to the living, and make them of good hope.  Do you think that
   I am grieved about the money?  It would have been a more intolerable
   disgrace to me if Cæsarius alone, who thought he had so many friends,
   turned out to have none.  Such is my request, and from such a cause
   does it arise, for perhaps my affairs are not altogether matters of
   indifference to you.  In what you will assist me, and by what means,
   and how, the matter itself will suggest and your wisdom will consider.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXXVII.

   (A letter of recommendation for Eudoxius a Rhetorician for whom Gregory
   had a warm regard.)

   To honour a mother is a religious duty.  Now, different individuals
   have different mothers; but the common mother of all is our country.
   This mother you have honoured by the splendour of your whole life; and
   you will honour her again now by obtaining for me that which I
   entreat.  And what is my request?  You certainly know Eudoxius the
   Rhetorician, the most learned of her sons.  His son, to speak
   concisely, another Eudoxius both in life and learning, now approaches
   you through me.  In order then to get yourself a yet better name, be
   helpful to him in the matters for which he asks your assistance.  For
   it were a shame were you, who are the universal Patron of our Country,
   and who have done good to so many, and I will add, who will yet
   continue to do so, should not honour above all him who is most
   excellent in learning and in his eloquence, which you ought to honour,
   if for no other reason, because he uses it to praise your goodness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXXIX.

   (About the same date.  A recommendation of one Amazonius, whose
   learning was much respected by Gregory.)

   I wish well to all my friends.  And when I speak of friends, I mean
   honourable and good men, linked with me in virtue, if indeed I myself
   have any claim to it.  Therefore at the present time when seeking how I
   might do a kindness to my excellent brother Amazonius (for I was very
   much pleased with the man in some intercourse which has lately taken
   place between us), I thought I might return him one favour for all,--in
   your friendship and protection.  For in a short time he shewed proof of
   an extensive education, both of the kind which I used once to be very
   zealous for, when I was shortsighted, and of that for which I am
   zealous in its place since I have been able to contemplate the summit
   of virtue.  Whether I in my turn have appeared to him to be worth
   anything in respect of virtue is his affair.  At any rate I shewed him
   the best things I have, namely, my friends to him as my friend.  Of
   these I reckon you as the first and truest, and want you to shew
   yourself so to him--as your common Country demands, and my desire and
   promise begs; for I promised him your patronage in return for all his
   kindness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XCIII.

   (Written soon after Gregory's resignation of the Archbishopric.)

   Our retreat and leisure and quiet have about them something very
   agreeable to me; but the fact that they cut me off from your friendship
   and society is not so advantageous but rather the other way.  Others
   enjoy your Perfection, to me it would be really a great boon if I might
   have just that shadow of conversation which comes in a letter.  Shall I
   see you again?  Shall I embrace again him of whom I am so proud, and
   shall this be granted to the remnant of my life?  If so, all thanks to
   God:  if not, the best part of my life is over.  Pray remember your
   friend Gregory and pray for him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. CXXXV.

   (About the middle of a.d. 382 Theodosius, on the recommendation of S.
   Damasus, summoned a new Synod of Eastern Bishops to meet at
   Constantinople, to try and heal the schism which had been embittered by
   the election of Flavian at Antioch.  As soon as Gregory heard of the
   convocation of this Synod he wrote to several of his influential
   friends at Court, to beg them to do their utmost for the promotion of
   peace.)

   I am philosophizing at leisure.  That is the injury my enemies have
   done me, and I should be glad if they would do more of the same sort,
   that I might look upon them still more as benefactors.  For it often
   happens that those who are wronged get a benefit, while they, whom we
   would treat well, suffer injury.  That is the state of my affairs.  But
   if I cannot make every one believe this, I am very anxious, that at all
   events you, for them all, to whom I most willingly give an account of
   my affairs, should know, or rather I feel certain that you do know it,
   and can persuade those who do not.  You, however, I beg to give all
   diligence, now at any rate, if you have not done so before, to bring
   together to one voice and mind the sections of the world that are so
   unhappily divided; and above all if you should perceive, as I have
   observed, that they are divided not on account of the Faith, but by
   petty private interests.  To succeed in doing this would earn you a
   reward; and my retirement would have less to grieve over if I could see
   that I did not grasp at it to no purpose, but was like a Jonas,
   willingly casting myself into the sea, that the storm might cease and
   the sailors be saved.  If, however, they are still as storm-tost as
   ever, I at all events have done what I could.

   §5. To Amphilochius the Younger.

   Ep. IX.

   (Constantine and Constantius had granted exemption from the military
   tax to all clerics.  This privilege was, however, abolished by Julian,
   and was restored by Valentinian and Valens:  but the collectors of
   revenue often tried to levy it on them in spite of the exemption.  The
   collector at Nazianzus tried to do this in the case of a Deacon named
   Euthalius, in whose behalf Gregory wrote the following letter to
   Amphilochius, who was at the time one of the principal magistrates of
   the province.  The date of the letter is given as a.d. 372, the year of
   Gregory's Ordination to the Priesthood.  For further particulars about
   this Amphilochius, see introd. to letters II. and III. to Cæsarius Epp.
   22, 23.)

   Support a wellbuilt chamber with columns of gold, as Pindar [4748]
   says, and make yourself from the beginning known to us on the right
   side in our present anxiety, that you may build yourself a notable
   palace, and shew yourself in it with a good fame.  But how will you do
   this?  By honouring God and the things of God, than Whom there can be
   nothing greater in your eyes.  But how, and by what act can you honour
   Him?  By this one act, by protecting the servants of God and ministers
   of the altar.  One of these is our fellow deacon Euthalius, on whom, I
   know not how, the officers of the Prefecture are trying to impose a
   payment of gold after his promotion to the higher rank.  Pray do not
   allow this.  Reach a hand to this deacon and to the whole clergy, and
   above all to me, for whom you care; for otherwise he would have to
   endure a grievous wrong, alone of men deprived of the kindness of the
   time and the privilege granted by the Emperor to the Clergy, and would
   even be insulted and fined, possibly on account of my weakness.  It
   would be well for you to prevent this even if others are not well
   disposed.

   Ep. XIII.

   (See the first letter to Sophronius.  The nature of the trouble here
   alluded to is unknown.  There are several letters to various persons in
   reference to his troubles and difficulties, many of them coming from
   his reluctance to undertake the duties of any public office.  He died
   at an early age, leaving his widow, Alypiana, with a large family to
   bring up in very reduced circumstances.  Her troubles and the education
   of her children were matters of much concern to Gregory, whose frequent
   letters on the subject will be found below.)

   I approve the statement of Theognis, who, while not praising the
   friendship which goes no further than cups and pleasures, praises that
   which extends to actions in these words,

   Beside a full wine cup a man has many friends:

   But they are fewer when grave troubles press.

   We, however, have not shared winecups with each other, nor indeed have
   we often met (though we ought to have been very careful to do so, both
   for our own sake, and for the sake of the friendship which we inherited
   from our fathers), but we do ask for the goodwill which shews itself in
   acts.  A struggle is at hand, and a very serious struggle.  My son
   Nicobulus has got into unexpected troubles, from a quarter from which
   troubles would least be looked for.  Therefore I beg you to come and
   help us as soon as you can, both to take part in trying the case, and
   to plead our cause, if you find that a wrong is being done us.  But if
   you cannot come, at any rate do not let yourself be previously retained
   by the other side, or sell for a small gain the freedom which we know
   from everybody's testimony has always characterized you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXV.

   (Amphilochius was acquitted of the charges made against him, referred
   to in former letters; but the result of the accusation on his own mind
   was such that he resigned his office, and retired to a sort of
   hermitage at a place called Ozizala, not far from Nazianzus, where he
   devoted his hours of labour to the cultivation of vegetables.  The four
   letters which follow are of no special importance, and are only given
   as specimens of the lighter style which Gregory could use with his
   intimate friends.)

   I did not ask you for bread, just as I would not ask for water from the
   inhabitants of Ostracine.  But if I were to ask for vegetables from a
   man of Ozizala it were no strange thing, nor too great a strain on
   friendship; for you have plenty of them, and we a great dearth.  I beg
   you then to send me some vegetables, and plenty of them, and the best
   quality, or as many as you can (for even small things are great to the
   poor); for I am going to receive the great Basil, and you, who have had
   experience of him full and philosophical, would not like to know him
   hungry and irritated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXVI.

   What a very small quantity of vegetables you have sent me!  They must
   surely be golden vegetables!  And yet your whole wealth consists of
   orchards and rivers and groves and gardens, and your country is
   productive of vegetables as other lands are of gold, and

   You dwell among meadowy leafage.

   But corn is for you a fabulous happiness, and your bread is the bread
   of angels, as the saying is, so welcome is it, and so little can you
   reckon upon it.  Either, then, send me your vegetables less grudgingly,
   or--I won't threaten you with anything else, but I won't send you any
   corn, and will see whether there is any truth in the saying that
   grasshoppers live on dew!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XXVII.

   You make a joke of it; but I know the danger of an Ozizalean starving
   when he has taken most pains with his husbandry.  There is only this
   praise to be given them, that even if they die of hunger they smell
   sweet, and have a gorgeous funeral.  How so?  Because they are covered
   with plenty of all sorts of flowers.

   Ep. XXVIII.

   In visiting the mountain cities which border on Pamphylia I fished up
   in the Mountains a sea Glaucus; I did not drag the fish out of the
   depths with a net of flax, but I snared my game with the love of a
   friend.  And having once taught my Glaucus to travel by land, I sent
   him as the bearer of a letter to Your Goodness.  Please receive him
   kindly, and honour him with the hospitality commended in the Bible, not
   forgetting the vegetables.

   Ep. LXII.

   (The Armenian referred to is probably Eustathius Bishop of Sebaste, the
   capital of Armenia Minor.  He had been a disciple of Arius, but more
   than once professed the Nicene Faith, changing his opinions with his
   company.  His personal character however stood very high, and for a
   long time S. Basil regarded him with affectionate esteem.  Indeed S.
   Basil's Rule for Monks is based on one drawn up by him.  But after
   Basil's elevation to the Episcopate Eustathius began to oppose him and
   to calumniate him on all sides, and even entered openly into communion
   with the Arians.  It would seem that this man tried to get Amphilochius
   round to his side, and through him Gregory.)

   The Injunction of your inimitable Honour is not barbaric, but Greek, or
   rather christian; but as for the Armenian on whom you pride yourself
   so, he is a downright barbarian, and far from our honour.

   Ep. LXIII.  To Amphilochius the Elder.

   (In a.d. 374 Amphilochius was made Bishop of Iconium; and his father, a
   man of the same name, was deeply aggrieved at being thus deprived of
   his son, to whom he had looked to support him in his old age, and
   accused Gregory of being the cause.  Gregory, who had just lost his own
   father, writes to undeceive him, and to convince him how much he dreads
   the burden of the responsibilities of the episcopate for his friend as
   well as for himself.)

   Are you grieving?  I, of course, am full of joy!  Are you weeping?  I,
   as you see, am keeping festival and glorying in the present state of
   things!  Are you grieved because your son is taken from you and
   promoted to honour on account of his virtue, and do you think it a
   terrible misfortune that he is no longer with you to tend your old age,
   and, as his custom is, to bestow on you all due care and service?  But
   it is no grief to me that my father has left me for the last journey,
   from which he will return to me no more, and I shall never see him
   again!  Then I for my part do not blame you, nor do I ask you for due
   condolence, knowing as I do that private troubles allow no leisure for
   those of strangers; for no man is so friendly and so philosophical as
   to be above his own suffering and to comfort another when needing
   comfort himself.  But you on the contrary heap blow on blow, when you
   blame me, as I hear you do, and think that your son and my brother is
   neglected by us, or even betrayed by us, which is a still heavier
   charge; or that we do not recognize the loss which all his friends and
   relatives have suffered, and I more than all, because I had placed in
   him my hopes of life, and looked upon him as the only bulwark, the only
   good counsellor, and the only sharer of my piety.  And yet, on what
   grounds do you form this opinion?  If on the first, be assured that I
   came over to you on purpose, and because I was troubled by the rumour,
   and I was ready to share your deliberations while it was still time for
   consultation about the matter; and you imparted anything to me rather
   than this, whether because you were in the same distress, or with some
   other purpose, I know not what.  But if the last, I was prevented from
   meeting you again by my grief, and the honour I owed my father, and his
   funeral, over which I could not give anything precedence, and that when
   my sorrow was fresh, and it would not only have been wrong but also
   quite improper to be unseasonably philosophical, and above human
   nature.  Moreover, I thought that I was previously engaged by the
   circumstances, especially as his had come to such a conclusion as
   seemed good to Him who governs all our affairs.  So much concerning
   this matter.  Now I beg you to put aside your grief, which is most
   unreasonable I am sure; and if you have any further grievance, bring it
   forward that you may not grieve both me in part and yourself, and put
   yourself in a position unworthy of your nobility, blaming me instead of
   others, though I have done you no wrong, but, if I must say the truth,
   have been equally tyrannized over by our common friend, although you
   used to think me your only benefactor.

   Ep. CLXXI.  To Amphilochius, Bishop of Iconium.

   Scarcely yet delivered from the pains of my illness, I hasten to you,
   the guardian of my cure.  For the tongue of a priest meditating of the
   Lord raises the sick.  Do then the greater thing in your priestly
   ministration, and loose the great mass of my sins when you lay hold of
   the Sacrifice of Resurrection.  For your affairs are a care to me
   waking or sleeping, and you are to me a good plectrum, and have made a
   welltuned lyre to dwell within my soul, because by your numerous
   letters you have trained my soul to science.  But, most reverend
   friend, cease not both to pray and to plead for me when you draw down
   the Word by your word, when with a bloodless cutting you sever the Body
   and Blood of the Lord, using your voice for the glaive. [4749]

   Ep. CLXXXIV.

   (Bosporius, Bishop of Colonia in Cappadocia Secunda, who had apparently
   taken a prominent part in the election and consecration of Eulalius to
   the See of Nazianzus, was accused of heresy by Helladius Archbishop of
   Cæsarea, and a Council met at Parnassus to try him, a.d. 383.  Gregory,
   not being able personally to attend this Synod, writes to Amphilochius,
   to beg him to undertake the defence of the accused.  The letter is
   lost, but Gregory's friend carried out his mission with success, and
   the following letter is to thank him for his kindness.)

   The Lord fulfil all thy petitions (do not despise a father's prayer),
   for you have abundantly refreshed my age, both by having gone to
   Parnassus, as you were invited to do, and by having refuted the calumny
   against the most Reverend and God-beloved Bishop.  For evil men love to
   set down their own faults to those who convict them.  For the age of
   this man is stronger than all the accusations, and so is his life, and
   we too who have often heard from him and taught others, and those whom
   he has recovered from error and added to the common body of the church;
   but yet the present evil times called for more accurate proof on
   account of the slanderers and evil-disposed; and this you have supplied
   us with, or rather you have supplied it to those who are of fickler
   mind and easily led away by such men.  But if you will undertake a
   longer journey, and will personally give testimony, and settle the
   matter with the other bishops, you will be doing a spiritual work
   worthy of your Perfection.  I and those with me salute your Fraternity.

   §6.  To Nectarius Archbishop of Constantinople.

   (Gregory, having failed to persuade the Council of a.d. 381 to end the
   schism at Antioch by recognizing Paulinus as successor to Meletius,
   thought it best for the sake of peace to resign the Archbishopric.  The
   Council elected in his place Nectarius, a catechumen at the time, who
   was Prætor of Constantinople, and he was consecrated and enthroned June
   9, 381.  Gregory always maintained cordial relations with him; and the
   following letter was written in answer to the formal announcement of
   his election.)

   Ep. LXXXVIII.

   It was needful that the Royal Image should adorn the Royal City.  For
   this reason it wears you upon its bosom, as was fitting, with the
   virtues and the eloquence, and the other beauties with which the Divine
   Favour has conspicuously enriched you.  Us it has treated with utter
   contempt, and has cast away like refuse and chaff or a wave of the
   sea.  But since friends have a common interest in each other's affairs,
   I claim a share in your welfare, and feel myself a partaker in your
   glory and the rest of your prosperity.  Do you also, as is fitting,
   partake of the anxieties and reverses of your exiles, and not only (as
   the tragedians say) hold and stick to happy circumstances, but also
   take your part with your friend in troubles; that you may be perfectly
   just, living justly and equally in respect of friendship and of your
   friends.  May good fortune abide with you long, that you may do yet
   more good; yes, may it be with you irrevocably and eternally, after
   your prosperity here, unto the passage to that other world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. XCI.

   (A letter of no great importance, except as shewing the friendly
   feelings which Gregory continued to maintain towards his successor.)

   Affairs with us go on as usual:  we are quiet without strifes and
   disputes, valuing as we do the reward (which has no risk attaching to
   it) of silence, beyond everything.  And we have derived some profit
   from this rest, having by God's mercy fairly recovered from our
   illness.  Do you ride on and reign, as holy David says, [4750] and may
   God, Who has honoured you with Priesthood, accompany you throughout,
   and set it for you above all slander.  And that we may give each other
   a proof of our courage, and may not suffer any human calamity as we
   stand before God, I send this message to you, and do you promptly
   assent to it.  There are many reasons which make me very anxious about
   our very dear Pancratius.  Be good enough to receive him kindly, and to
   commend him to the best of your friends, that he may attain his
   object.  His object is through some kind of military service to obtain
   relief from public office, though there is no single kind of life that
   is unexposed to the slanders of worthless men, as you very well know.

   (Written about a.d. 382, commending his friend George, a deacon of
   Nazianzus, to the good offices of the Archbishop and the Count of the
   Domestics, or Master of the Imperial Household, on account of his
   private troubles and anxieties.)

   People in general make a very good guess at your disposition--or
   rather, they do not conjecture, but they do not refuse to believe me
   when I pride myself on the fact that you deem me worthy of no small
   respect and honour.  One of these people is my very precious son
   George, who having fallen into many losses, and being very much
   overwhelmed by his troubles, can find only one harbour of safety,
   namely, to be introduced to you by us, and to obtain some favour at the
   hands of the Most Illustrious the Count of the Domestics.  Grant them
   this favour, either to him and his need, or else, if you prefer it, to
   me, to whom I know you have resolved to grant all favours; and facts
   also persuade me that this is true of you.

   Ep. CLXXXV.

   (See Introduction to Ep. CLXXXIV. above, p. 469.  Bosporius was to be
   sent to Constantinople that his cause might there be tried in the Civil
   Courts.  Gregory therefore writes to the Archbishop to point out what a
   serious infringement of the rights of the Church this would be.
   Probably the attitude which Nectarius took up at the suggestion of
   Gregory was the occasion of the Edict which Theodosius addressed in
   February, a.d. 384 or 5, to the Augustal Prefect, withdrawing all
   clerics from the jurisdiction of the civil tribunals, and placing them
   under the exclusive control of the episcopal courts.)

   Whenever different people praise different points in you, and all are
   pushing forward your good fame, as in a marketplace, I contribute
   whatever I can, and not less than any of them, because you deign also
   to honour me, to cheer my old age, as a well-beloved son does that of
   his father.  For this reason I now also venture to offer to you this
   appeal on behalf of the Most Reverend and God-beloved Bishop Bosporius;
   though ashamed on the one hand that such a man should need any letter
   from me, since his venerable character is assured both by his daily
   life and by his age; and on the other hand not less ashamed to keep
   silence and not to say a word for him, while I have a voice, and honour
   faith, and know the man most intimately.  The controversy about the
   dioceses you will no doubt yourself resolve according to the grace of
   the Spirit which is in you, and to the order of the canons.  But I hope
   Your Reverence will see that it is not to be endured that our affairs
   are to be posted up in the secular courts.  For even if they who are
   judges of such courts are Christians, as by the mercy of God they are,
   what is there in common between the Sword and the Spirit?  And even if
   we yield this point, how or where can it be just that a dispute
   concerning the faith should be interwoven with the other questions?  Is
   our God-beloved Bishop Bosporius to-day a heretic?  Is it to-day that
   his hoar hair is set in the balance, who has brought back so many from
   their error, and has given so great proof of his orthodoxy, and is a
   teacher of us all?  No, I entreat you, do not give place to such
   slanders; but if possible reconcile the opposing parties and add this
   to your praises; but if this may not be, at all events do not allow us
   all, (with whom he has lived, and with whom he has grown old,) to be
   outraged by such insolence,--us whom you know to be accurate preachers
   of the Gospel, both when to be so was dangerous, and when it is free
   from risk; and to be unable to endure any detraction from the One
   Unapproachable Godhead.  And I beg you to pray for me who am suffering
   from serious illness.  I and all who are with me salute the brethren
   who surround you.  May you, strong and of good courage and of good fame
   in the Lord, grant to us and the Churches the support which all in
   common demand.

   Ep. CLXXXVI.

   (A letter of introduction for a relative.)

   What would you have done if I had come in person and taken up your
   time?  I am quite certain you would have undertaken with all zeal to
   deliver me from the slander, if I may take as a token what has happened
   before.  Do me this favour, then, through my most discreet kinswoman
   who approaches you through me, reverencing first the age of your
   petitioner, and next her disposition and piety, which is more than is
   ordinarily found in a woman; and besides this, her ignorance in
   business-matters, and the troubles now brought upon her by her own
   relations; and above all, my entreaty.  The greatest favour you can do
   me is speed in the benefit for which I am asking.  For even the unjust
   judge in the Gospel [4751] shewed kindness to the widow, though only
   after long beseeching and importunity.  But from you I ask for speed,
   that she may not be overwhelmed by being long burdened with anxieties
   and miseries in a foreign land; though I know quite well that Your
   Piety will make that alien land to be a fatherland to her.

   §7. To Theodore, Bishop of Tyana.

   (Theodore, a native of Arianzus, and an intimate friend of Gregory,
   accompanied him to Constantinople a.d. 379, and shared his persecution
   by the Arians, who broke into their church during the celebration of
   the divine liturgy, and pelted the clergy with stones.  Theodore could
   not bring himself to put up with this, and declared his intention of
   prosecuting the aggressors.  Gregory wrote the following letter to
   dissuade him from this course, by shewing him how much more noble it is
   to forgive than to revenge.)

   Ep. LXXVII.

   I hear that you are indignant at the outrages which have been committed
   on us by the Monks and the Mendicants.  And it is no wonder, seeing
   that you never yet had felt a blow, and were without experience of the
   evils we have to endure, that you did feel angry at such a thing.  But
   we as experienced in many sorts of evil, and as having had our share of
   insult, may be considered worthy of belief when we exhort Your
   Reverence, as old age teaches and as reason suggests.  Certainly what
   has happened was dreadful, and more than dreadful,--no one will deny
   it:  that our altars were insulted, our mysteries disturbed, and that
   we ourselves had to stand between the communicants and those who would
   stone them, and to make our intercessions a cure for stonings; that the
   reverence due to virgins was forgotten, and the good order of monks,
   and the calamity of the poor, who lost even their pity through
   ferocity.  But perhaps it would be better to be patient, and to give an
   example of patience to many by our sufferings.  For argument is not so
   persuasive of the world in general as is practice, that silent
   exhortation.

   We think it an important matter to obtain penalties from those who have
   wronged us:  an important matter, I say, (for even this is sometimes
   useful for the correction of others)--but it is far greater and more
   Godlike, to bear with injuries.  For the former course curbs
   wickedness, but the latter makes men good, which is much better and
   more perfect than merely being not wicked.  Let us consider that the
   great pursuit of mercifulness is set before us, and let us forgive the
   wrongs done to us that we also may obtain forgiveness, and let us by
   kindness lay up a store of kindness.

   Phineas was called Zelotes because he ran through the Midianitish woman
   with the man who was committing fornication with her, [4752] and
   because he took away the reproach from the children of Israel:  but he
   was more praised because he prayed for the people when they had
   transgressed. [4753]   Let us then also stand and make propitiation,
   and let the plague be stayed, and let this be counted unto us for
   righteousness.  Moses also was praised because he slew the Egyptian
   that oppressed the Israelite; [4754] but he was more admirable because
   he healed by his prayer his sister Miriam when she was made leprous for
   her murmuring. [4755]   Look also at what follows.  The people of
   Nineve are threatened with an overthrow, but by their tears they redeem
   their sin. [4756]   Manasses was the most lawless of Kings, [4757] but
   is the most conspicuous among those who have attained salvation through
   mourning.

   O Ephraim what shall I do unto thee, [4758] saith God.  What anger is
   here expressed--and yet protection is added.  What is swifter than
   Mercy?  The Disciples ask for flames of Sodom upon those who drive
   Jesus away, but He deprecates revenge. [4759]   Peter cuts off the ear
   of Malchus, one of those who outraged Him, but Jesus restores it.
   [4760]   And what of him who asks whether he must seven times forgive a
   brother if he has trespassed, is he not condemned for his
   niggardliness, for to the seven is added seventy times seven? [4761]
   What of the debtor in the Gospel who will not forgive as he has been
   forgiven? [4762]   Is it not more bitterly exacted of him for this?
   And what saith the pattern of prayer?  Does it not desire that
   forgiveness may be earned by forgiveness?

   Having so many examples let us imitate the mercy of God, and not desire
   to learn from ourselves how great an evil is requital of sin.  You see
   the sequence of goodness.  First it makes laws, then it commands,
   threatens, reproaches, holds out warnings, restrains, threatens again,
   and only when forced to do so strikes the blow, but this little by
   little, opening the way to amendment.  Let us then not strike suddenly
   (for it is not safe to do so), but being self-restrained in our fear
   let us conquer by mercy, and make them our debtors by our kindness,
   tormenting them by their conscience rather than by anger.  Let us not
   dry up a fig tree which may yet bear fruit, [4763] nor condemn it as
   useless and cumbering the ground, when possibly the care and diligence
   of a skilful gardener may yet heal it.  And do not let us so quickly
   destroy so great and glorious a work through what is perhaps the spite
   and malice of the devil; but let us choose to shew ourselves merciful
   rather than severe, and lovers of the poor rather than of abstract
   justice; and let us not make more account of those who would enkindle
   us to this than of those who would restrain us, considering, if nothing
   else, the disgrace of appearing to contend against mendicants who have
   this great advantage that even if they are in the wrong they are pitied
   for their misfortune.  But as things are, consider that all the poor
   and those who support them, and all the Monks and Virgins are falling
   at your feet and praying you on their behalf.  Grant to all these for
   them this favour (since they have suffered enough as is clear by what
   they have asked of us) and above all to me who am their
   representative.  And if it appear to you monstrous that we should have
   been dishonoured by them, remember that it is far worse that we should
   not be listened to by you when we make this request of you.  May God
   forgive the noble Paulus his outrages upon us.

   Ep. CLII.

   (On his retirement from Constantinople Gregory had at the request of
   the Bishops of the Province, and especially of Theodore of Tyana the
   Metropolitan, and Bosporius Bishop of Colonia (see letters above) and
   at the earnest solicitation of the people, undertaken the charge of the
   Diocese of Nazianzus; but he very soon found that his health was not
   equal to so great a task, and that he could not fulfil its calls upon
   him.  He struggled on for some time, but at length, finding himself
   quite unequal to it, he wrote as follows to the Metropolitan:)

   It is time for me to use these words of Scripture, To whom shall I cry
   when I am wronged? [4769]   Who will stretch out a hand to me when I am
   oppressed?  To whom shall the burden of this Church pass, in its
   present evil and paralysed condition?  I protest before God and the
   Elect Angels that the Flock of God is being unrighteously dealt with in
   being left without a Shepherd or a Bishop, through my being laid on the
   shelf.  For I am a prisoner to my ill health and have been very quickly
   removed thereby from the Church, and made quite useless to everybody,
   every day breathing my last, and getting more and more crushed by my
   duties.  If the Province had any other head, it would have been my duty
   to cry out and protest to it continually.  But since Your Reverence is
   the Superior, it is to you I must look.  For, to leave out everything
   else, you shall learn from my fellow-priests, Eulalius the
   Chorepiscopus [4770] and Celeusius, whom I have specially sent to Your
   Reverence, what these robbers [4771] who have now got the upper hand,
   are both doing and threatening.  To repress them is not in the power of
   my weakness, but belongs to your skill and strength; since to you, with
   His other gifts God has given that of strength also for the protection
   of His Church.  If in saying and writing this I cannot get a hearing, I
   shall take the only course remaining to me, that of publicly
   proclaiming and making known that this Church needs a Bishop, in order
   that it may not be injured by my feeble health.  What is to follow is
   matter for your consideration.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4769] Hab. ii. 1.

   [4770] Chorepiscopi;--a grade of clergy called into existence in the
   latter part of the Third Century, first in Asia Minor, to meet the
   difficulty of providing Episcopal supervision in the country districts
   of large Dioceses.  They seemed to have been allowed to confer the
   Minor, but not the Holy Orders, unless by special commission from the
   Diocesan, on the ground of their lack of original Jurisdiction.  That
   they were originally possessed of full Episcopal Orders there can be no
   doubt, but eventually the position was allowed to be held by Priests,
   and in the West the office became practically merged in that of the
   Archdeacon.

   Ep. CLIII.  To Bosporius, Bishop of Colonia.

   (S. Gregory had to carry out his threat.  He resigned the care of
   Nazianzus, and nothing would induce him to withdraw his resignation.
   Bosporius wrote him an urgent letter with this object, but he replied
   as follows:)

   Twice I have been tripped up by you, and have been deceived (you know
   what I mean), and, if it was justly, may the Lord smell from you an
   odour of sweet savour; [4772] if unjustly, may the Lord pardon it.  For
   so it is reasonable for me to speak of you, seeing we are commanded to
   be patient when injuries are inflicted on us.  But as you are master of
   your own opinions, so am I of mine.  That troublesome Gregory will no
   longer be troublesome to you.  I will withdraw myself to God, Who alone
   is pure and guileless.  I will retire into myself.  This I have
   determined; for to stumble twice on the same stone is attributed by the
   proverb to fools alone.

   Ep. CLVII.  To Theodore, Archbishop of Tyana.

   (S. Gregory succeeded at the end of a.d. 382 in convincing the
   Metropolitan and his Comprovincials of his sincerity in desiring to
   retire; and so they began to cast about for a Successor.  Gregory
   desired that his cousin the Chorepiscopus Eulalius should be nominated,
   but the Bishops felt some jealousy at what they took to be an attempt
   on his part to dictate to them, and refused to allow him to take any
   part in the election, on the ground that he either never had been, or
   at any rate had ceased to be one of the Bishops of the Province.  He
   protested, but finding that he could not convince them he withdrew his
   claim to a vote and wrote to Theodore, as follows:--)

   Our spiritual affairs have reached their limit:  I will not trouble you
   any further.  Join together:  take your precautions:  take counsel
   against us:  let our enemies have the victory:  let the canons be
   accurately observed, beginning with us, the most ignorant of men.
   There is no ill-will in accuracy; only do not let the rights of
   friendship be impeded.  The children of my very honoured son Nicobulus
   have come to the city to learn shorthand.  Be kind enough to look upon
   them with a fatherly and kindly eye (for the canons do not forbid
   this), but especially take care that they live near the Church.  For I
   desire that they should be moulded in character to virtue by continual
   association with Your Perfectness.

   Ep. CLXIII.

   (George a layman of Paspasus, was sent by Theodore of Tyana to Saint
   Gregory that the latter might convince him of his error and sin in
   repudiating an oath which he had taken, on the ground that it was taken
   in writing and not viva voce.  Gregory seems to have brought him to a
   better mind, and sent him back to the Metropolitan with the following
   letter, requesting that due penance be imposed upon him, and have its
   length regulated by his contrition.  This letter was read to the Second
   Council of Constantinople in 553, by Euphrantes, a successor of
   Theodore in the See of Tyana, and was accepted by the Fathers,
   wherefore it is regarded as having almost the force of a Canon of the
   Church Universal.)

   God grant you to the Churches, both for our glory, and for the benefit
   of many, being as you are so circumspect and cautious in spiritual
   matters as to make us also more cautious who are considered to have
   some advantage over you in years.  Since, however, you have wished to
   take us as partners in your spiritual inquiry (I mean about the oath
   which George of Paspasus appears to have sworn), we will declare to
   Your Reverence what presents itself to our mind.  Very many people, as
   it seems to me, delude themselves by considering oaths which are taken
   with the sanction of spoken imprecations to be real oaths, but those
   which are written and not verbally uttered, to be mere matter of form,
   and no oaths at all.  For how can we suppose that while a written
   schedule of debts is more binding than a verbal acknowledgment, yet a
   written oath is something other than an oath?  Or to speak concisely,
   we hold an oath to be the assurance given to one who asked for and
   obtained it.  Nor is it sufficient to say that he suffered violence
   (for the violence was the Law by which he bound himself), nor that
   afterwards he won the cause in the Law Court--for the very fact that he
   went to law was a breach of his oath.  I have persuaded our brother
   George of this, not to pretend excuses for his sin, and not to seek out
   arguments to defend his transgression, but to recognize the writing as
   an oath, and to bewail his sin before God and Your Reverence, even
   though he formerly deceived himself and took a different view of it.
   This is what we have personally argued with him; and it is evident that
   if you will discourse with him more carefully, you will deepen his
   contrition, since you are a great healer of souls, and having treated
   him according to the Canon for as long a time as shall seem right, you
   will afterwards be able to confer indulgence upon him in the matter of
   time.  And the measure of the time must be the measure of his
   compunction.

   Ep. CLXXXIII.

   (Helladius, Archbishop of Cæsarea, contested the validity of the
   election of Eulalius to the Bishopric of Nazianzus, and accused
   Bosporius of heresy.  S. Gregory here throws the whole weight of his
   authority into the other scale.  It is however manifest from the very
   terms of the letter that the person addressed is not Theodore of
   Tyana.  It was conjectured by Clémencet that perhaps he was Theodore of
   Mopsuestia.)

   Envy, which no one easily escapes, has got some foothold amongst us.
   See, even we Cappadocians are in a state of faction, so to speak--a
   calamity never heard of before, and not to be believed--so that no
   flesh may glory [4773] in the sight of God, but that we may be careful,
   since we are all human, not to condemn each other rashly.  For myself,
   there is some gain even from the misfortune (if I may speak somewhat
   paradoxically), and I really gather a rose out of thorns, as the
   proverb has it.  Hitherto I have never met Your Reverence face to face,
   nor conversed with you by letter, but have only been illuminated by
   your reputation; but now I am of necessity compelled to approach you by
   letter, and I am very grateful to him who has procured me this
   privilege.  I omit to write to the other Bishops about whom you wrote
   to me, as the opportunity has not yet arisen.  Moreover my weak health
   makes me less active in this matter; but what I write to you I write to
   them also through you.  My Lord the God-beloved Bishop Helladius [4774]
   must cease to waste his labour on our concerns.  For it is not through
   spiritual earnestness, but through party zeal, that he is seeking this;
   and not for the sake of accurate compliance with the canons, but for
   the satisfaction of anger, as is evident by the time he has chosen, and
   because many have moved with him unreasonably, for I must say this, and
   not trouble myself about it.  If I were physically in a condition to
   govern the Church of Nazianzus, to which I was originally appointed,
   and not to Sasima as some would falsely persuade you, I should not have
   been so cowardly or so ignorant of the Divine Constitutions as either
   to despise that Church, or to seek for an easy life in preference to
   the prizes which are in store for those who labour according to God's
   will, and work with the talent committed to their care.  For what
   profit should I have from my many labours and my great hopes, if I were
   ill advised in the most important matters?  But since my bodily health
   is bad, as everyone can plainly see, and I have not any responsibility
   to fear on account of this withdrawal, for the reason I have mentioned,
   and I saw that the Church through cleaving to me was suffering in its
   best interests and almost being destroyed through my illness, I prayed
   both before and now again my Lords the God-beloved Bishops (I mean
   those of our own Province) to give the Church a head, which they have
   done by God's Grace, worthy both of my desire and of your prayers.
   This I would have you both know yourself, most honourable Lord, and
   also inform the rest of the Bishops, that they may receive him and
   support him by their votes, and not bear heavily on my old age by
   believing the slander.  Let me add this to any letter.  If your
   examination finds my Lord the God-beloved Priest Bosporius guilty
   concerning the faith--a thing which it is not lawful even to
   suggest--(I pass over his age and my personal testimony) judge him so
   yourselves.  But if the discussion about the dioceses is the cause of
   this evil report and this novel accusation, do not be led away by the
   slander, and do not give to falsehoods a greater strength than to the
   truth, I beg you, lest you should cast into despair those who desire to
   do what is right.  May you be granted good health and spirits and
   courage and continual progress in the things of God to us and to the
   Church, whose common boast you are.

   Ep. CXXXIX.

   (This letter is written at a somewhat earlier date in reference to the
   consent he had been induced to give to remaining for some time longer
   as administrator of the See of Nazianzus.  It is certainly not
   addressed to Theodore of Tyana, and it is not known who this Theodore
   is.)

   He Who raised David His servant from the Shepherd's work to the Throne,
   and Your Reverence from the flock to the Work of the Shepherd:  He that
   orders our affairs and those of all who hope in Him according to His
   own Will:  may He now put it into the mind of Your Reverence to know
   the dishonour which I have suffered at the hands of my Lords the
   Bishops in the matter of their votes, in that they have agreed to the
   Election, [4775] but have excluded us.  I will not lay the blame on
   Your Reverence, because you have but recently come to preside over our
   affairs, and are, as is to be expected, for the most part unacquainted
   with our history.  This is quite enough:  for I have no mind to trouble
   you further, that I may not seem burdensome at the very beginning of
   our friendship.  But I will tell you what suggests itself to me in
   taking counsel with God.  I retired from the Church at Nazianzus, not
   as either despising God, or looking down on the littleness of the flock
   (God forbid that a philosophic [4776] soul should be so disposed); but
   first because I am not bound by any such appointment:  and secondly
   because I am broken down by my ill health, and do not think myself
   equal to such anxieties.  And since you too have been heavy on me, in
   reproaching me with my resignation, and I myself could not endure the
   clamours against me, and since the times are hard, threatening us with
   an inroad of enemies to the injury of the commonwealth of the whole
   Church, I finally made up my mind to suffer a defeat which is painful
   to my body, but perhaps not bad for my soul.  I make over this
   miserable body to the Church for as long as it may be possible,
   thinking it better to suffer any distress to the flesh rather than to
   incur a spiritual injury myself or to inflict it upon others, who have
   thought the worst of us, judging from their own experience.  Knowing
   this, do pray for me, and approve my resolution:  and perhaps it is not
   out of place to say, mould yourself to piety.

   Ep. XII.  (About a.d. 365).

   You joke me about Alypiana as being little and unworthy of your size,
   you tall and immense and monstrous fellow both in form and strength.
   For now I understand that soul is a matter of measure, and virtue of
   weight, and that rocks are more valuable than pearls, and crows more
   respectable than nightingales.  Well, well! rejoice in your bigness and
   your cubits, and be in no respect inferior to the famed sons of Aloeus.
   [4777]   You ride a horse, and shake a spear, and concern yourself with
   wild beasts.  But she has no such work; and no great strength is needed
   to carry a comb, [4778] or to handle a distaff, or to sit by a loom,
   "For such is the glory of woman." [4779]   And if you add this, that
   she has become fixed to the ground on account of prayer, and by the
   great movement of her mind has constant communion with God, what is
   there here to boast of in your bigness or the stature of your body?
   Take heed to seasonable silence:  listen to her voice:  mark her
   unadornment, her womanly virility, her usefulness at home, her love of
   her husband.  Then you will say with the Laconian, that verily soul is
   not a subject for measure, and the outer must look to the inner man.
   If you look at the things in this way you will leave off joking and
   deriding her as little, and you will congratulate yourself on your
   marriage.

   Ep. LI.

   (An answer to a request made by Nicobulus for a treatise on the art of
   writing letters.  Benoît thinks this and the following ones were
   written to the Younger Nicobulus.)

   Of those who write letters, since this is what you ask, some write at
   too great a length, and others err on the side of deficiency; and both
   miss the mean, like archers shooting at a mark and sending some shafts
   short of it and others beyond it; for the missing is the same though on
   opposite sides.  Now the measure of letters is their usefulness:  and
   we must neither write at very great length when there is little to say,
   nor very briefly when there is a great deal.  What?  Are we to measure
   our wisdom by the Persian Schoene, or by the cubits of a child, and to
   write so imperfectly as not to write at all but to copy the midday
   shadows, or lines which meet right in front of you, whose lengths are
   foreshortened and which show themselves in glimpses rather than
   plainly, being recognized only by certain of their extremities?  We
   must in both respects avoid the want of moderation and hit off the
   moderate.  This is my opinion as to brevity; as to perspicuity it is
   clear that one should avoid the oratorical form as much as possible and
   lean rather to the chatty:  and, to speak concisely, that is the best
   and most beautiful letter which can convince either an unlearned or an
   educated reader; the one, as being within the reach of the many; the
   other, as above the many; and it should be intelligible in itself.  It
   is equally disagreeable to think out a riddle and to have to interpret
   a letter.  The third point about a letter is grace:  and this we shall
   safeguard if we do not write in any way that is dry and unpleasing or
   unadorned and badly arranged and untrimmed, as they call it; as for
   instance a style destitute of maxims and proverbs and pithy sayings, or
   even jokes and enigmas, by which language is sweetened.  Yet we must
   not seem to abuse these things by an excessive employment of them.
   Their entire omission shews rusticity, but the abuse of them shews
   insatiability.  We may use them about as much as purple is used in
   woven stuffs.  Figures of speech we shall admit, but few and modest.
   Antitheses and balanced clauses and nicely divided sentences, we shall
   leave to the sophists, or if we do sometimes admit them, we shall do so
   rather in play than in earnest.  My final remark shall be one which I
   heard a clever man make about the eagle, that when the birds were
   electing a king, and came with various adornment, the most beautiful
   point about him was that he did not think himself beautiful.  This
   point is to be especially attended to in letter-writing, to be without
   adventitious ornament and as natural as possible.  So much about
   letters I send you by a letter; but perhaps you had better not apply it
   to myself, who am busied about more important matters.  The rest you
   will work out for yourself, as you are quick at learning, and those who
   are clever in these matters will teach you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. LII.

   (Nicobulus asked Gregory to publish a collection of his letters.
   Gregory forwards a copy.)

   You are asking flowers from an autumn meadow, and arming Nestor in his
   old age, in demanding from me now something clever in the way of
   language, after I have long neglected all that is enjoyable in language
   and in life.  But yet (since it is not an Eurysthean or Herculean
   labour that you are imposing on me, but rather one which is very
   agreeable and quiet, to collect for you as many of my own letters as I
   can), do you place this volume among your books--a work not amatory but
   oratorical, and not for display so much as for use, and that for our
   own home. [4780]   For different authors have different
   characteristics, greater or smaller.  Mine is a tendency to instruct by
   maxims and positive statements wherever opportunity occurs.  And as in
   a legitimate child, so also in language, the father is always visible,
   not less than parents are shewn by bodily characteristics.  Mine are
   such as I have mentioned.  You may repay me both by writing and by
   deriving profit from what I have written.  I cannot ask for or request
   any better reward than this, either more profitable to the asker, or
   more becoming him who gives it.

   (Gregory put a collection of Basil's letters with his own, and gave
   them the first place.  Nicobulus seems to have been surprised at this,
   and asked the reason.  Gregory explains as follows.)

   I have always preferred the Great Basil to myself, though he was of the
   contrary opinion; and so I do now, not less for truth's sake than for
   friendship's.  This is the reason why I have given his letters the
   first place and my own the second.  For I hope we two will always be
   coupled together; and also I would supply others with an example of
   modesty and submission.

   On Laconicism.  To be laconic is not merely, as you suppose, to write
   few words, but to say a great deal in few words.  Thus I call Homer

   by the matter and not by the letters.

   §9.  To Olympius.

   (Olympius was Prefect of Cappadocia Secunda in 382.  One letter to him
   against the Apollinarians, has already been given; the rest, which are
   to follow are mainly recommendations of various persons to his
   patronage.)

   Ep. CIV.

   All The Other favours which I have received I know to be due to your
   kindness; and may God reward you for them with His own mercies; and may
   one of these be, that you may discharge your office of prefect with
   good fame and splendour from beginning to end.  In what I now ask I
   come rather to give than to receive, if it is not arrogant to say so.
   I personally introduce poor Philumena to you, to entreat your justice,
   and to move you to the tears with which she afflicts my soul.  She
   herself will explain to you in what and by whom she has been wronged,
   for it would not be right for me to bring accusations against any one.
   But this much it is necessary for me to say, that widowhood and
   orphanhood have a right to the assistance of all right-minded men, and
   especially of those who have wife and children, those great pledges of
   pity, since we--ourselves only men--are set to judge men.  Pardon me
   that I plead with you for these by letter, since it is by ill health
   that I am deprived of seeing a ruler so kind and so conspicuous for
   virtue that even the prelude of your administration is more precious
   than the good fame of others even at the end of their term.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. CV.

   The time is swift, the struggle great, and my sickness severer,
   reducing me almost to immovability.  What is left but to pray to God,
   and to supplicate your kindness, the one, that He will incline your
   mind to gentler counsels, the other that you will not roughly dismiss
   our intercession, but will receive kindly the wretched Paulus, whom
   justice has brought under your hands, perhaps in order that it may make
   you more illustrious by the greatness of your kindness, and may commend
   our prayers (such as they are) to your mercy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. CVI.

   Here is another laying before you a letter, of which, if the truth may
   be said, you are the cause yourself, for you provoke them by the honour
   you do them.  Here too is another petitioner for you, a prisoner of
   fear, our kinsman Eustratius, who with us and by us entreats your
   goodness, inasmuch as he cannot endure to be in perpetual rebellion
   against your government, even though a just terror has frightened him,
   nor does he choose to entreat you by anyone else than me, that he may
   make your mercy to him more conspicuous through his use of such
   intercessors, whom at all events you yourself make great by thus
   accepting their appeal.  I will say one thing, and that briefly.  All
   the other favours you conferred upon me; but this you will confer upon
   your own judgment, since once you purposed to comfort our age and
   infirmity with such honours.  And I will add that you are continually
   rendering God more propitious to you.

   Ep. CXXVI.

   (While Gregory was at Xantharis an opportunity presented itself for
   seeing Olympius, but a return of illness prevented him from taking
   advantage of it.  He writes to express his regret, and takes the
   opportunity also to request that Nicobulus may be exempted from the
   charge of the Imperial Posts.)

   I was happy in a dream.  For having been brought as far as the
   Monastery to obtain some comfort from the bath, and then hoping to meet
   you, and having this good fortune almost in my hands, and having
   delayed a few days, I was suddenly carried away by my illness, which
   was already painful in some respects and threatening in others.  And,
   if one must find some conjecture to account for the misfortune, I
   suffered in the same way as the polypods do, which if torn by force
   from the rocks risk the loss of the suckers by which they attach
   themselves to the rocks, or carry off some portion of the latter.
   Something of this kind is my case.  And what I should have asked Your
   Excellency for had I seen you, I now venture to ask for though I am
   absent.  I found my son Nicobulus much worried by the care of the Post,
   and by close attention to the Monastery.  He is not a strong man, and
   has great distaste for solitude.  Make use of him for anything else you
   please, for he is eager to serve your authority in all things; but if
   it be possible set him free from this charge, if for no other reason,
   at any rate to do him honour as my Hospitaller.  Since I have asked
   many favours from you for many people, and have obtained them, I need
   also your kindness for myself.

   Ep. CXXXI.

   (In 382 Gregory was summoned to a Synod at Constantinople; he wrote to
   Procopius, the Prefectus Urbi, and declined to go, on the ground of his
   great dislike to Episcopal Synods, from which, he said, he had never
   known any good to result.  However he seems to have received a more
   urgent summons through Icarius and Olympius.  His reply to Icarius has
   been lost; that to Olympius is as follows.)

   It is more serious to me than my illness, that no one will believe that
   I am ill, but that so long a journey is enjoined upon me, and I am
   pushed into the midst of troubles from which I rejoiced to have
   withdrawn, and almost thought that I ought to be grateful for this to
   my bodily affliction.  For quiet and freedom from affairs is more
   precious than the splendour of a busy life.  I wrote this yesterday to
   the Most Illustrious Icarius, from whom I received the same summons:
   and I now beg your Magnanimity also to write this for me, for you are a
   very trustworthy witness of my ill health.  Another proof of my
   inability is the loss which I have now suffered in having been unable
   even to come and enjoy your society, who are so kind a Governor, and so
   admirable for virtue that even the preludes of your term of office are
   more honourable than the good fame which others can earn by the end of
   theirs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. CXL.

   Again I write when I ought to come:  but I gain confidence to do so
   from yourself, O Umpire of spiritual matters (to put the first thing
   first), and Corrector of the Commonweal--and both by Divine
   Providence:  who have also received as the reward of your piety that
   your affairs would prosper to your mind, and that you alone should find
   attainable what to every one else is out of reach.  For wisdom and
   courage conduct your government, the one discovering what is to be
   done, and the other easily carrying out what has been discovered.  And
   the greatest of all is the purity of your hands with which all is
   directed.  Where is your ill-gotten gold?  There never was any; it was
   the first thing you condemned to exile as an invisible tyrant.  Where
   is illwill?  It is condemned.  Where is favour?  Here you do bend
   somewhat (for I will accuse you a little), but it is in imitating the
   Divine Mercy, which at the present time your soldier Aurelius entreats
   of you by me.  I call him a foolish fugitive, because he has placed
   himself in our hands, and through ours in yours, sheltering himself
   under our gray hair and our Priesthood (for which you have often
   professed your veneration) as if it were under some Imperial Image.
   See, this sacrificing and unbloodstained hand leads this man to you; a
   hand which has written often in your praise, and will I am sure write
   yet more, if God continue your term of government--yours, I mean, and
   that of your colleague Themis.

   Ep. CXLI.

   (The people of Nazianzus had in some way incurred the loss of civic
   rights; and the Order for the forfeiture of the title of City had been
   signed by Olympius.  This led to something like a revolt on the part of
   a certain number of the younger citizens:  and this Olympius determined
   to punish by the total destruction of the place.  S. Gregory was again
   prevented by sickness from appearing in person before the Governor:
   but he pleaded the cause of his native city (using its official Latin
   name of Diocæsarea) in the following letters so successfully as to
   induce Olympius to pardon the outbreak.)

   Again an opportunity for kindness:  and again I am bold enough to
   commit to a letter my entreaty about so important a matter.  My illness
   makes me thus bold, for it does not even allow me to go out, and it
   does not permit me to make a fitting entrance to you.  What then is my
   Embassy?  Pray receive it from me gently and kindly.  The death of a
   single man, who to-day is and to-morrow will not be and will not return
   to us is of course a dreadful thing.  But it is much more dreadful for
   a City to die, which Kings founded, and time compacted, and a long
   series of years has preserved.  I speak of Diocæsarea, once a City, a
   City no longer, unless you grant it mercy.  Think that this place now
   falls at your feet by me:  let it have a voice, and be clothed in
   mourning and cut off its hair as in a tragedy, and let it speak to you
   in such words as these:

   Give a hand to me that lie in the dust:  help the strengthless:  do not
   add the weight of your hand to time, nor destroy what the Persians have
   left me.  It is more honourable to you to raise up cities than to
   destroy those that are distressed.  Be my founder, either by adding to
   what I possess, or by preserving me as I am.  Do not suffer that up to
   the time of your administration I should be a City, and after you
   should be so no longer:  do not give occasion to after times to speak
   evil of you, that you received me numbered among cities, and left me an
   uninhabited spot, which was once a city, only recognizable by mountains
   and precipices and woods.

   This let the City of my imagination do and say to your mercy.  But
   deign to receive an exhortation from me as your friend:  certainly
   chastise those who have rebelled against the Edict of your authority.
   On this behalf I am not bold to say anything, although this piece of
   audacity was not, they say, of universal design, but was only the
   unreasoning anger of a few young men.  But dismiss the greater part of
   your anger, and use a larger reasoning.  They were grieved for their
   Mother's being put to death; they could not endure to be called
   citizens, and yet to be without political rights:  they were mad:  they
   committed an offence against the law:  they threw away their own
   safety:  the unexpectedness of the calamity deprived them of reason.
   Is it really necessary that for this the city should cease to be a
   city?  Surely not.  Most excellent, do not write the order for this to
   be done.  Rather respect the supplication of all citizens and statesmen
   and men of rank--for remember the calamity will touch all alike--even
   if the greatness of your authority keeps them silent, sighing as it
   were in secret.  Respect also my gray hair:  for it would be dreadful
   to me, after having had a great city, now to have none at all, and that
   after your government the Temple which we have raised to God, and our
   love for its adornment, is to become a dwelling for beasts.  It is not
   a terrible thing if some statues were thrown down--though in itself it
   would be so--but I would not have you think that I am speaking of this,
   when all my care is for more important things:  but it is dreadful if
   an ancient city is to be destroyed with them--one which has splendidly
   endured, as I, who am honoured by you, and am supposed to have some
   influence, have lived to see.  But this is enough upon such a subject,
   for I shall not, if I speak at greater length, find anything stronger
   than your own reasons, by which this nation is governed--and may more
   and greater ones be governed by them too, and that in greater
   commands.  This however it was needful that Your Magnanimity should
   know about those who have fallen before your feet, that they are
   altogether wretched and despairing, and have not shared in any disorder
   with those who have broken the law, as I am certified by many who were
   then present.  Therefore deliberate what you may think expedient, both
   for your own reputation in this world, and your hopes in the next.  We
   will bear what you determine--not indeed without grief--but we will
   bear it:  for what else can we do?  If the worse determination prevail,
   we shall be indignant, and shall shed a tear over our City that has
   ceased to be.

   Ep. CXLII.

   Though my desire to meet you is warm, and the need of your petitioners
   is great, yet my illness is invincible.  Therefore I am bold to commit
   my intercession to writing.  Have respect to our gray hair, which you
   have already often reverenced by good actions.  Have respect also to my
   infirmity, to which my labours for God have in part contributed, if I
   may swagger a little.  For this cause spare the citizens who look to me
   because I use some freedom of speech with you.  And spare also the
   others who are under my care.  For public affairs will suffer no damage
   through mercy, since you can do more by fear than others by
   punishment.  May you, as your reward for this, obtain such a Judge as
   you shew yourself to your petitioners and to me their intercessor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. CXLIII.

   What does much experience, and experience of good do for men?  It
   teaches kindness, and inclines them to those who entreat them.  There
   is no such education in pity as the previous reception of goodness.
   This has happened to myself among others.  I have learned compassion by
   the things which I have suffered.  And do you see my greatness of soul
   when I myself need your gentleness in my own affairs?  I intercede for
   others, and do not fear lest I should exhaust all your kindness on
   other men's concerns.  I am writing thus on behalf of the Presbyter
   Leontius--or, if I may so describe him, the ex-Presbyter.  If he has
   suffered sufficiently for what he has done, let us stop there, lest
   excess become injustice.  And if there is still any balance of
   punishment due, and the consequences of his crime have not yet equalled
   his offence, yet remit it for our sake and God's, and that of the
   sanctuary, and the general assembly of the priests, among whom he was
   once numbered, even though he has now shewn himself unworthy of them,
   both by what he has done and by what he has suffered.  If I can prevail
   with you it will be best; but if not, I will bring to you a more
   powerful intercessor, her who is the partner both of your rule and of
   your good fame.

   Ep. CXLIV.

   (Verianus, a citizen of Nazianzus, had been offended by his son-in-law,
   and on this account wished his daughter to sue for a divorce.  Olympius
   referred the matter to the Episcopal arbitration of S. Gregory, who
   refused to countenance the proceeding, and writes the two following
   letters, the first to the Prefect, the second to Verianus himself.)

   Haste is not always praiseworthy.  For this reason I have deferred my
   answer until now about the daughter of the most honorable Verianus,
   both to allow for time setting matters right, and also because I
   conjecture that Your Goodness does not approve of the divorce, inasmuch
   as you entrusted the enquiry to me, whom you knew to be neither hasty
   nor uncircumspect in such matters.  Therefore I have refrained myself
   till now, and, I venture to think, not without reason.  But since we
   have come nearly to the end of the allotted time, and it is necessary
   that you should be informed of the result of the examination I will
   inform you.  The young lady seems to me to be of two minds, divided
   between reverence for her parents and affection for her husband.  Her
   words are on their side, but her mind, I rather think, is with her
   husband, as is shewn by her tears.  You will do what commends itself to
   your justice, and to God who directs you in all things.  I should most
   willingly have given my opinion to my son Verianus that he should pass
   over much of what is in question, with a view not to confirm the
   divorce, which is entirely contrary to our law, [4781] though the Roman
   law may determine otherwise.  For it is necessary that justice be
   observed--which I pray you may ever both say and do.

   Ep. CXLV.  To Verianus.

   Public executioners commit no crime, for they are the servants of the
   laws:  nor is the sword unlawful with which we punish criminals.  But
   nevertheless, the public executioner is not a laudable character, nor
   is the death-bearing sword received joyfully.  Just so neither can I
   endure to become hated by confirming the divorce by my hand and
   tongue.  It is far better to be the means of union and of friendship
   than of division and parting of life.  I suppose it was with this in
   his mind that our admirable Governor entrusted me with the enquiry
   about your daughter, as one who could not proceed to divorce abruptly
   or unfeelingly.  For he proposed me not as Judge, but as Bishop, and
   placed me as a mediator in your unhappy circumstances.  I beg you
   therefore, to make some allowance for my timidity, and if the better
   prevail, to use me as a servant of your desire:  I rejoice in receiving
   such commands.  But if the worse and more cruel course is to be taken,
   seek for some one more suitable to your purpose.  I have not time, for
   the sake of favouring your friendship (though in all respects I have
   the highest regard for you), to offend against God, to Whom I have to
   give account of every action and thought.  I will believe your daughter
   (for the truth shall be told) when she can lay aside her awe of you,
   and boldly declare the truth.  At present her condition is
   pitiable--for she assigns her words to you, and her tears to her
   husband.
     __________________________________________________________________

   To Olympius.  Ep. CXLVI.

   This is what I said as if by a sort of prophecy, when I found you
   favourable to every request, and was making insatiable use of your
   gentleness, that I fear I shall exhaust your kindness upon the affairs
   of others.  For see, a contest of my own has come (if that is mine
   which concerns my own relations), and I cannot speak with the same
   freedom.  First, because it is my own.  For to entreat for myself,
   though it may be more useful, is more humiliating.  And next, I am
   afraid of excess as destroying pleasure, and opposing all that is
   good.  So matters stand, and I conjecture only too rightly.
   Nevertheless with confidence in God before Whom I stand, and in your
   magnanimity in doing good, I am bold to present this petition.

   Suppose Nicobulus to be the worst of men:--though his only crime is
   that through me he is an object of envy, and more free than he ought to
   be.  And suppose that my present opponent is the most just of men.  For
   I am ashamed to accuse before Your Uprightness one whom yesterday I was
   supporting:  but I do not know if it will seem to you just that
   punishment should be demanded for one man's crimes from another, though
   these were quite strange to him, and had not even his consent; from the
   man who has so stirred his household and been so upset as to have
   surrendered to his accuser more readily than the latter wished.  Must
   Nicobulus or his children be reduced to slavery as his persecutors
   desire?  I am ashamed both of the ground of the persecution and of the
   time, if this is to be done while both you are in power and I have
   influence with you.  Not so, most admirable friend, let not this be
   suggested to Your Integrity.  But recognizing by the winged swiftness
   of your mind the malice from which this proceeds, and having respect to
   me your admirer, shew yourself a merciful judge to those who are being
   disturbed--for to-day you are not merely judging between man and man,
   but between virtue and vice; and to this more consideration than by an
   ordinary man must be given by those who are like you in virtue and are
   skilful governors.  And in return for this you shall have from me not
   only the matter of my prayers, which I know you do not, like so many
   men, despise; but also that I will make your government famous with all
   to whom I am known.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ep. CLIV.

   To me you are Prefect even after the expiry of your term of office--for
   I judge things differently from the run of men--because you embrace in
   yourself every prefectoral virtue.  For many of those who sit on lofty
   thrones are to me base, all those whose hand makes them base and slaves
   of their subjects. [4782]   But many are high and lofty though they
   stand low, whom virtue places on high and makes worthy of greater
   government.  But what have I to do with this?  No longer is the great
   Olympius with us, nor does he bear our rudder-lines.  We are undone, we
   are betrayed, we have become again the Second Cappadocia, after having
   been made the First by you.  Of other men's matters why should I speak?
   but who will cherish the old age of your Gregory, and administer to his
   weakness the enchantment of honours, and make him more honourable
   because he obtains kindness for many from you?  Now then depart on your
   journey with escort and greater pomp, leaving behind for us many tears,
   and carrying with you much wealth, and that of a kind which few
   Prefects do, good fame, and the being inscribed on all hearts, pillars
   not easily moved.  If you preside over us again with greater and more
   illustrious rule, (this is what our longing augurs), we shall offer to
   God more perfect thanks.
