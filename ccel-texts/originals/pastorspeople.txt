   THE

   DUTY OF PASTORS AND PEOPLE DISTINGUISHED:

   or,

   a brief discourse touching the administration of things commanded in
   religion;

   especially concerning the means to be used by the people of God
   (distinct from church officers) for the increasing of divine knowledge
   in themselves and others:

   wherein bounds are prescribed to their performances; their liberty is
   enlarged to the utmost extent of the dictates of nature and rules of
   charity; their duty laid down in directions drawn from Scripture
   precepts and the practice of God's people in all ages.

   Together with

   the several ways of extraordinary calling to the office of public
   teaching,

   with what assurance such teachers may have of their calling, and what
   evidence they can give of it unto others.

Prefatory note.

   The title-page of the following treatise indicates that it was
   published in the year 1644; but in the second chapter of "The Review of
   the True Nature of Schism," in this volume, it is stated that the date
   is a misprint for 1643. The work is dedicated to Sir Edward Scot, in
   whose family, it would appear, the author had for some time resided,
   and who had offered him some "ecclesiastical preferment" when it was
   vacant. Owen here declares himself to be in sentiment a Presbyterian,
   in opposition to Prelacy and Independency. He afterwards changed his
   views on church-government; but in the work on schism, to which we have
   just referred, he declares that, on the subjects under discussion in
   this treatise, his principles had undergone no essential change: "When
   I compare what I then wrote with my present judgment, I am scarce able
   to find the least difference between the one and the other."

   Two chapters of the work are occupied with a statement of the provision
   made for conducting religious instruction and worship under the
   patriarchal and Mosaic dispensations. An interesting chapter follows on
   the spiritual priesthood of all believers, as destructive of the
   superstitions tenet which invests the office of the ministry with
   esoteric virtue and sanctity. The several ways under which men may be
   constrained, under an extraordinary call, to impart religious
   instruction publicly to others, are next considered. The treatise
   closes with an assertion of the right and obligation of private
   Christians to conduct certain kinds of divine worship, without
   interfering with the official functions of the Christian ministry.

   The tractate to which he alludes, "De Sacerdotio Christi, contra Armin.
   Socin. et Papistas," is described as not yet published, and seems never
   to have been published. It may have supplied part of the long and
   valuable exercitations on the priesthood of Christ prefixed to the
   Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews, as, from the slight allusion
   to it in this treatise, the same topics appear to have been handled in
   it. He refers, also, in the close of this treatise, to an answer, drawn
   up for the satisfaction of some private friends, to the arguments of
   the Remonstrants for liberty of prophesying. Mr Orme supposes this
   unpublished document to be identical with the "Tractatus de Christi
   Sacerdotio." We are not aware of any grounds for supposing such an
   identity. The subjects which these unpublished tracts seem to have
   discussed are obviously different. -- Ed.

   I have perused this Discourse touching "The Administration of Things
   Commanded in Religion," and conceive it written with much clearness of
   judgment and moderation of spirit; and therefore do approve of it to be
   published in print.

To the truly noble and my ever honoured friend,
Sir Edward Scot,
of Scot's Hall in Kent,
Knight of the Honourable Order of the Bath.

   Sir,

   Having of late been deprived of the happiness to see you, I make bold
   to send to visit you; and because that the times are troublesome, I
   have made choice of this messenger, who, having obtained a license to
   pass, fears no searching. He brings no news, at least to you, but that
   which was from the beginning, and must continue unto the end, which you
   have heard, and which (for some part thereof) you have practised out of
   the word of God. He hath no secret messages prejudicial to the state of
   church or commonwealth; neither, I hope, will he entertain any such
   comments by the way, considering from whom he comes and to whom he
   goes; of whom the one would disclaim him and the other punish him.
   Ambitious I am not of any entertainment for these few sheets, neither
   care much what success they find in their travel, setting them out
   merely in my own defence, to be freed from the continued solicitations
   of some honest, judicious men, who were acquainted with their contents,
   being nothing but an hour's country discourse, resolved from the
   ordinary pulpit method into its own principles. When I first thought of
   sending it to you, I made full account to use the benefit of the
   advantage in recounting of and returning thanks for some of those many
   undeserved favours which I have received from you; but addressing
   myself to the performance, I fainted in the very entrance, finding
   their score so large that I know not where to begin, neither should I
   know how to end. Only one I cannot suffer to lie hid in the crowd,
   though other engagements hindered me from embracing it -- namely, your
   free proffer of an ecclesiastical preferment, then vacant and in your
   donation. Yet, truly, all received courtesies have no power to oblige
   me unto you in comparison of that abundant worth which, by experience,
   I have found to be dwelling in you. Twice, by God's providence, have I
   been with you when your county hath been in great danger to be ruined,
   -- once by the horrid insurrection of a rude, godless multitude, and
   again by the invasion of a potent enemy prevailing in the neighbour
   county; at both which times, besides the general calamity justly
   feared, particular threatenings were daily brought unto you: under
   which sad dispensations, I must crave leave to say (only to put you in
   mind of yourself, if it should please God again to reduce you to the
   like straits), that I never saw more resolved constancy, more cheerful,
   unmoved Christian courage in any man. Such a valiant heart in a weak
   body, such a directing head where the hand was but feeble, such
   unwearied endeavours under the pressures of a painful infirmity, so
   well advised resolves in the midst of imminent danger, did I then
   behold, as I know not where to parallel. Neither can I say less, in her
   kind, of your virtuous lady, whose known goodness to all, and
   particular indulgences to me, make her, as she is in herself, very
   precious in my thoughts and remembrance: whom having named, I desire to
   take the advantage thankfully to mention her worthy son, my noble and
   very dear friend C. Westrow; whose judgment to discern the differences
   of these times, and his valour in prosecuting what he is resolved to be
   just and lawful, place him among the number of those very few to whom
   it is given to know aright the causes of things, and vigorously to
   execute holy and laudable designs. But farther of him I choose to say
   nothing, because if I would, I cannot but say too little. Neither will
   I longer detain you from the ensuing discourse, which I desire to
   commend to your favourable acceptance, and with my hearty prayers that
   the Lord would meet you and yours in all those ways of mercy and grace
   which are necessary to carry you along through all your engagements,
   until you arrive at the haven of everlasting glory, where you would be.
   I rest your most obliged servant in Jesus Christ, our common Master,

   John Owen.

Preface.

   The glass of our lives seems to run and keep pace with the extremity of
   time. The end of those "ends of the world" [1] which began with the
   gospel is doubtless coming upon us. He that was instructed what should
   be till time should be no more, [2] said it was eschate hora, [3] the
   last hour, in his time. Much sand cannot be behind, and Christ shakes
   the glass; many minutes of that hour cannot remain; the next measure we
   are to expect is but "a moment, the twinkling of an eye, wherein we
   shall all be changed.'' [4] Now, as if the horoscope of the decaying
   age had some secret influence into the wills of men to comply with the
   decrepit world, they generally delight to run into extremes. Not that I
   would have the fate of the times to bear the faults of men, [5] like
   him who cried, Ouk ego aitios eimi alla Zeus kai moira, to free
   himself, entitling God and fate to his sins; but only to show how the
   all-disposing providence of the Most High works such a compliance of
   times and persons as may jointly drive at his glorious aims, causing
   men to set out in such seasons as are fittest for their travel. This
   epidemical disease of the aged world is the cause why, in that great
   diversity of contrary opinions wherewith men's heads and hearts are now
   replenished, the truth pretended to be sought with so much earnestness
   may be often gathered up quite neglected between the parties litigant.
   "Medio tutissimus" is a sure rule, but that fiery spirits, --


   "Pyroeis, Eous, et Æthon,

   ? Quartusque Phlegon," --

   will be mounting. In the matter concerning which I propose my weak
   essay, some would have all Christians to be almost ministers; others,
   none but ministers to be God's clergy. Those would give the people the
   keys, these use them to lock them out of the church; the one ascribing
   to them primarily all ecclesiastical power for the ruling of the
   congregation, the other abridging them of the performance of spiritual
   duties for the building of their own souls: as though there were no
   habitable earth between the valley (I had almost said the pit) of
   democratical confusion and the precipitous rock of hierarchical
   tyranny. When unskilful archers shoot, the safest place to avoid the
   arrow is the white. Going as near as God shall direct me to the truth
   of this matter, I hope to avoid the strokes of the combatants on every
   side; and therefore will not handle it eristikos, with opposition to
   any man or opinion, but dogmatikos, briefly proposing mine own required
   judgment: the summary result whereof is, that the sacred calling may
   retain its ancient dignity, though the people of God be not deprived of
   their Christian liberty. To clear which proposal some things I shall
   briefly premise.

Chapter I.

   Of the administration of holy things among the patriarchs before the
   law.

   Concerning the ancient patriarchs: From these, some, who would have
   Judaism to be but an intercision of Christianity, [6] derive the
   pedigree of Christians, affirming the difference between us and them to
   be solely in the name, and not the thing itself. Of this, thus much at
   least is true, that "the law of commandments contained in ordinances"
   [7] did much more diversify the administration of the covenant before
   and after Christ than those plain moralities wherewith in their days it
   was clothed. Where the assertion is deficient, antiquity hath given its
   authors sanctuary from farther pursuit. Their practice, then, were it
   clear, can be no precedent for Christians. All light brought to the
   gospel, in comparison of those full and glorious beams that shine in
   itself, is but a candle set up in the sun; yet for their sakes who
   found out the former unity, I will (not following the conceit of any,
   nor the comments of many) give you such a bare narration, as the
   Scripture will supply me withal, of their administration of the holy
   things and practice of their religion (as it seems Christianity, though
   not so called). And doubt you not of divine approbation and
   institution; for all prelacy, at least until Nimrod hunted for
   preferment, was "de jure divino."

   I find, then, that before the giving of the law, the chief men among
   the servants of the true God did, every one in their own families, with
   their neighbours adjoining of the same persuasion, perform those things
   which they knew to be required, by the law of nature, tradition, or
   special revelation (the unwritten word of those times), in the service
   of God; instructing their children and servants in the knowledge of
   their creed concerning the nature and goodness of God, the fall and sin
   of man, the use of sacrifices, and the promised seed (the sum of their
   religion); and, moreover, performing ta pros ton Theon, things
   appertaining unto God. This we have delivered concerning Seth, Enoch,
   Noah, Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Jethro, Job, and others. [8] Now,
   whether they did this as any way peculiarly designed unto it as an
   office, or rather in obedient duty to the prime law of nature, in which
   and to whose performance many of them were instructed and encouraged by
   divine revelation (as seems most probable), is not necessary to be
   insisted on. To me, truly, it seems evident that there were no
   determinate ministers of divine worship before the law; for where find
   we any such office instituted? where the duties of those officers
   prescribed? or were they of human invention? [9] God would never allow
   that in any regard the will of the creature should be the measure of
   his honour and worship. "But the right and exercise of the priesthood,"
   say some, "was in the first-born;" but a proof of this will be for ever
   wanting. Abel was not Adam's eldest son, yet, if any thing were
   peculiar to such an office, it was by him performed. That both the
   brothers carried their sacrifices to their father is a vain surmise.
   [10] Who was priest, then, when Adam died? Neither can any order of
   descent be handsomely contrived. Noah had three sons: grant the eldest
   only a priest; were the eldest sons of his other sons priests, or no?
   If not, how many men fearing God were scattered over the face of the
   earth utterly deprived of the means of right worship! if so, there must
   be a new rule produced beyond the prescript of nature, whereby a man
   may be enabled by generation to convey that to others which he hath not
   in himself. I speak not of Melchizedek and his extraordinary
   priesthood; why should any speak where the Holy Ghost is silent? If we
   pretend to know him, we overthrow the whole mystery, and run cross to
   the apostle, affirming him to be apatora ametora, Without father,
   mother, or genealogy. For so long time, then, as the greatest
   combination of men was in distinct families (which sometimes were very
   great [11] ), politics and economics being of the same extent, all the
   way of instruction in the service and knowledge of God was by the way
   of paternal admonition, -- for the discharge of which duty Abraham is
   commended, Gen. xviii. 19; whereunto the instructors had no particular
   engagement, but only the general obligation of the law of nature. What
   rule they had for their performances towards God doth not appear. All
   positive law, in every kind, is ordained for the good of community.
   That then being not, no such rule was assigned until God gathered a
   people, and lifted up the standard of circumcision for his subjects to
   repair unto. The world in the days of Abraham beginning generally to
   incline to idolatry and polytheism, [12] the first evident
   irreconcilable division was made between his people and the malignants,
   which before lay hid in his decree. Visible signs and prescript rules
   were necessary for such a gathered church. This before I conceive to
   have been supplied by special revelation.

   The law of nature a long time prevailed for the worship of the one true
   God. The manner of this worship, the generality had at first (as may be
   conceived) from the vocal instruction of Adam, full of the knowledge of
   divine things; this afterward their children had from them by
   tradition, helped forward by such who received particular revelations
   in their generation, such as Noah, thence called "A preacher of
   righteousness." So knowledge of God's will increased, [13] until sin
   quite prevailed, and "all flesh had corrupted his way." All apostasy
   for the most part begins in the will, which is more bruised by the fall
   than the understanding. Nature is more corrupted in respect of the
   desire of good than the knowledge of truth. The knowledge of God would
   have flourished longer in men's minds had not sin banished the love of
   God out of their hearts.

   The sum is, that before the giving of the law, every one in his own
   person served God according to that knowledge he had of his will.
   Public performances were assigned to none, farther than the obligation
   of the law of nature to their duty in their own families. I have
   purposely omitted to speak of Melchizedek, as I said before, having
   spoken all that I can or dare concerning him on another occasion. Only
   this I will add: they who so confidently affirm him to be Shem, the son
   of Noah, and to have his priesthood in an ordinary way, by virtue of
   his primogeniture, might have done well to ask leave of the Holy Ghost
   for the revealing of that which he purposely concealed to set forth no
   small mystery, by them quite overthrown. And he who of late makes him
   look upon Abraham and the four kings, all of his posterity, fighting
   for the inheritance of Canaan (of which cause of their quarrel the
   Scripture is silent), robs him at least of one of his titles, a "king
   of peace," making him neither king nor peaceable, but a bloody
   grandsire, that either could not or would not part his fighting
   children, contending for that whose right was in him to bestow on whom
   he would.

   And thus was it with them in the administration of sacred things: There
   was no divine determination of the priestly office on any order of men.
   When things appertaining unto God were to be performed in the name of a
   whole family (as afterward, 1 Sam. xx. 6), perhaps the honour of the
   performance was by consent given to the first-born. Farther; the way of
   teaching others was by paternal admonition (so Gen. xviii. 19); motives
   thereunto, and rules of their proceeding therein, being the law of
   nature and special revelation. Prescription of positive law, ordained
   for the good of community, could have no place when all society was
   domestical. To instruct others (upon occasion) wanting instruction, for
   their good, is an undeniable dictate of the first principles of nature,
   obedience to which was all the ordinary warrant they had for preaching
   to any beyond their own families; observed by Lot, Gen. xix. 7, though
   his sermon contained a little false doctrine, verse 8. Again; as
   special revelation leaves a great impression on the mind of him to whom
   it is made, so an effectual obligation for the performance of what it
   directeth unto: "The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord God
   hath spoken, who can but prophesy?" Amos iii. 8. And this was Noah's
   warrant for those performances from whence he was called "A preacher of
   righteousness," 2 Pet. ii. 5. Thus, although I do not find any
   determinate order of priesthood by divine institution, yet do I not
   thence conclude, with Aquin. 12. æ. quest. 3. a 1. (if I noted right at
   the reading of it), that all the worship of God (I mean for the manner
   of it) was of human invention, yea, sacrifices themselves; for this
   will-worship, as I showed before, God always rejected. No doubt but
   sacrifices and the manner of them were of divine institution, albeit
   their particular original in regard of precept, though not of practice,
   be to us unknown. For what in all this concerns us, we may observe that
   a superinstitution of a new ordinance doth not overthrow any thing that
   went before in the same kind, universally moral or extraordinary, nor
   at all change it, unless by express exception; as, by the introduction
   of the ceremonial law, the offering of sacrifices, which before was
   common to all, was restrained to the posterity of Levi. Look, then,
   what performances in the service of God that primitive household of
   faith was in the general directed unto by the law of nature, the same,
   regulated by gospel light (not particularly excepted), ought the
   generality of Christians to perform; which what they were may be
   collected from what was fore-spoken.

Chapter II.

   Of the same among the Jews, and of the duty of that people distinct
   from their church officers.

   Concerning the Jews after the giving of Moses' law: The people of God
   were then gathered in one, and a standard was set up for all his to
   repair unto, and the church of God became like a city upon a hill,
   conspicuous to all, and a certain rule set down for every one to
   observe that would approach unto him. As, then, before the law, we
   sought for the manner of God's worship from the practice of men, so
   now, since the change of the external administration of the covenant,
   from the prescription of God. Then we guessed at what was commanded by
   what was done; now, at what was done by what was commanded. And this is
   all the certainty we can have in either kind, though the consequence
   from the precept to the performance, and on the contrary, in this
   corrupted state of nature, be not of absolute necessity; only, the
   difference is, where things are obscured, it is a safer way to prove
   the practice of men by God's precept, charitably supposing them to have
   been obedient, than to wrest the divine rule to their observation,
   knowing how prone men are to deify themselves by mixing their
   inventions with the worship of God. The administration of God's
   providence towards his church hath been various, and the communication
   of himself unto it, at "sundry times," hath been in "divers manners;"
   especially, it pleased him not to bring it to perfection but by
   degrees, as the earth bringeth forth fruit; "first the blade, then the
   ear, after that the full corn in the ear." [14] Thus, the church,
   before the giving of Moses' law, seems to have had two main defects,
   which the Lord at that time supplied; -- one in discipline or
   government, in that every family exercised the public worship of God
   within itself or apart (though some do otherwise conclude from Gen. iv.
   26), which was first removed by establishing a consistory of elders;
   the other in the doctrine, wanting the rule of the written word, being
   directed by tradition, the manifold defects whereof were made up by a
   special revelation. To neither of these defects was the church since
   exposed. Whether there was any thing written before the giving of the
   law is not worth contending about. Austin thought Enoch's prophecy was
   written by him; [15] and Josephus affirms that there were two pillars
   erected, one of stone, the other of brick, before the flood, wherein
   divers things were engraven; [16] and Sixtus Senensis, that the book of
   the wars of the Lord was a volume ancienter than the books of Moses; --
   but the contrary opinion is most received: so Chrysost. Hom. 1. in
   Mali. [17] After its giving, none ever doubted of the perfection of the
   written word for the end to which it was ordained, until the Jews had
   broached their Talmud to oppose Christ, and the Papists their
   traditions to advance Antichrist; doubtless the sole aim of the work,
   whatever were the intentions of the workmen.

   The lights which God maketh are sufficient to rule the seasons for
   which they are ordained. As, in creating of the world, God" made two
   great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light
   to rule the night;" so, in the erection of the new world of his church,
   he set up two great lights, the lesser light of the Old Testament to
   guide the night, the dark space of time under the law, and the greater
   light of the New Testament to rule the glorious day of the gospel. And
   these two lights do sufficiently enlighten every man that cometh into
   this new world. There is no need of the false fire of tradition where
   God sets up such glorious lights. This be premised for the proneness of
   men to deflect from the golden rule and heavenly pole-star in the
   investigation of the truth, especially in things of this nature
   concerning which we treat, wherein ordinary endeavours are far greater
   in searching after what men have done than what they ought to have
   done; and when the fact is once evidenced from the pen of a rabbi or a
   father, presently to conclude the right. Amongst many, we may take a
   late treatise, for instance, entitled, "Of Religious Assemblies and the
   Public Service of God," [18] whose author would prescribe the manner of
   God's worship among Christians from the custom of the Jews; and their
   observations he would prove from the rabbis, not at all taking notice
   that from such observances they were long ago recalled to the "law and
   to the testimony," and afterward for them sharply rebuked by Truth
   itself. [19] Doubtless it is a worthy knowledge to be able, and a
   commendable diligence, to search into those coiners of curiosities; but
   to embrace the fancies of those wild heads, which have nothing but
   novelty to commend them, and to seek their imposition on others, is but
   an abusing of their own leisure and others' industry. The issue of such
   a temper seems to be the greatest part of that treatise; which because
   I wait only for some spare hours to demonstrate in a particular tract,
   I shall for the present omit the handling of divers things there spoken
   of, though otherwise they might very opportunely here be mentioned, --
   as the office and duty of prophets, the manner of God's worship in
   their synagogues, the original and institution of their later teachers,
   scribes and Pharisees, etc., and briefly only observe those things
   which are most immediately conducing to my proposed subject.

   The worship of God among them was either moral or ceremonial and
   typical. The performances belonging unto the latter, with all things
   thereunto conducing, were appropriated, to them whom God had peculiarly
   set apart for that purpose. By ceremonial worship I understand all
   sacrifices and offerings, the whole service of the tabernacle, and
   afterward of the temple; all which were typical, and established merely
   for the present dispensation, not without purpose of their abrogation,
   when that which was to be more perfect should appear. Now, the several
   officers, with their distinct employments in and about this service,
   were so punctually prescribed and limited by Almighty God, that as none
   of them might allotrioepiskopein, without presumptuous impiety, intrude
   into the function of others not allotted to them, as Num. xvi. 1-10; so
   none of their brethren might presume to intrude into the least part of
   their office without manifest sacrilege, Josh. xxii. 11-20. True it is,
   that there is mention of divers in the Scripture that offered
   sacrifices, or vowed so to do, who were strangers from the priest's
   office, yea, from the tribe of Levi: as Jephthah, Judges ix.; Manoah,
   chap. xiii.; David, 2 Sam. vi., and again, chap. xxiv.; Solomon, 1
   Kings iii., and again, chap. ix. But following our former rule of
   interpreting the practice by the precept, we may find, and that truly,
   that all the expressions of their offerings signify no more but they
   brought those things to be offered, and caused the priests to do what
   in their own persons they ought not to perform. Now, hence, by the way,
   we may observe that the people of God under the New Testament,
   contradistinct from their teachers, have a greater interest in the
   performance of spiritual duties belonging to the worship of God, and
   more in that regard is granted unto them and required of them than was
   of the ancient people of the Jews, considered as distinguished from
   their priests, because their duty is prescribed unto them under the
   notion of these things which then were appropriate only to the priests,
   as of offering incense, sacrifice, oblations, and the like; which, in
   their original institution, were never permitted to the people of the
   Jews, but yet tralatitiously and by analogy are enjoined to all
   Christians But of these afterward.

   The main question is about the duty of the people of God in
   performances for their own edification, and the extent of their lawful
   undertakings for others' instruction. For the first, which is of
   nearest concernment unto themselves, the sum of their duty in this kind
   may be reduced to these two heads:-- First, To hear the word and law of
   God read attentively, especially when it was expounded; secondly, To
   meditate therein themselves, to study it by day and night, and to get
   their senses exercised in that rule of their duty: concerning each of
   which we have both the precept and the practice, God's command and
   their performance. The one in that injunction given unto the priest,
   Deut. xxxi. 11-13 "When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord
   thy God, in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
   before all Israel in their hearing. Gather the people together, men,
   and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates,
   that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your
   God, and observe to do all the words of this law; and that their
   children, which have not known, may hear and learn." All which we find
   punctually performed on both sides, Neh. viii. 1-8. Ezra the priest,
   standing on a pulpit of wood, read the law and gave the meaning of it;
   and the "ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law."
   Which course continued until there was an end put to the observances of
   that law; as Acts xv. 21, "Moses of old time hath in every city them
   that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath-day." On
   which ground, not receding from their ancient observations, the people
   assembled to hear our Saviour teaching with authority, Luke xxi. 38;
   and St Paul divers times took advantage of their ordinary assemblies to
   preach the gospel unto them. For the other, which concerns their own
   searching into the law and studying of the word, we have a strict
   command, Deut. vi. 6-9, "And these words, which I command thee this
   day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto
   thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house,
   and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
   thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand,
   and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write
   them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates." Which strict
   charge is again repeated, chap. xi. 18, summarily comprehending all
   ways whereby they might become exercised in the law. Now, because this
   charge is in particular given to the king, chap. xvii. 18-20, the
   performance of a king in obedience thereunto will give us light enough
   into the practice of the people. And this we have in that most
   excellent psalm of David, namely, cxix.; which for the most part is
   spent in petitions for light, direction, and assistance in that study,
   in expressions of the performance of this duty, and in spiritual
   glorying of his success in his divine meditations; especially, verse
   99, he ascribeth his proficiency in heavenly wisdom and understanding
   above his teachers, not to any special revelation, not to that
   prophetical light wherewith he was endued (which, indeed, consisting in
   a transient irradiation of the mind, being a supernatural impulsion,
   commensurate to such things as are connatural only unto God, doth of
   itself give neither wisdom nor understanding), but unto his study in
   the testimonies of God. The blessings pronounced upon and promises
   annexed to the performance of this duty concern not the matter in hand;
   only, from the words wherein the former command is delivered, two
   things may be observed:-- 1. That the paternal teaching and instruction
   of families in things which appertain to God being a duty of the law of
   nature, remained in its full vigour, and was not at all impaired by the
   institution of a new order of teachers for assemblies beyond
   domestical, then established. Neither, without doubt, ought it to cease
   amongst Christians, there being no other reason why now it should but
   that which then was not effectual.

   Secondly, That the people of God were not only permitted, but enjoined
   also, to read the Scriptures, and upon all occasions, in their own
   houses and elsewhere, to talk of them, or communicate their knowledge
   in them, unto others. There had been then no council at Trent to forbid
   the one; nor, perhaps, was there any strict canon to bring the other
   within the compass of a "conventicle." But now, for the solemn public
   teaching and instructing of others, it was otherwise ordained; for this
   was committed to them, in regard of ordinary performance, who were set
   apart by God; as for others before named, so also for that purpose. The
   author of the treatise I before mentioned concludeth that the people
   were not taught at the public assemblies by priests as such, -- that
   is, teaching the people was no part of their office or duty; but, on
   the contrary, that seems to be a man's duty in the service or worship
   of God which God requires of him, and that appertains to his office,
   whose performance is expressly enjoined unto him as such, and for whose
   neglect he is rebuked or punished. Now, all this we find concerning the
   priests' public teaching of the people; for the proof of which the
   recital of a few pertinent places shall suffice. Lev. x. 11, we have an
   injunction laid upon Aaron and his sons to "teach the children of
   Israel all the statutes which the Lord had spoken unto them by the hand
   of Moses." And of the Levites it is affirmed, Deut. xxxiii. 10, "They
   shall teach Jacob thy statutes, and Israel thy law." Now, though some
   restrain these places to the discerning of leprosies, and between holy
   and unholy, with their determination of difficulty emergent out of the
   law, yet this no way impairs the truth of that I intend to prove by
   them; for even those things belonged to that kind of public teaching
   which was necessary under that administration of the covenant. But
   instead of many, I will name one not liable to exception: Mal. ii. 7,
   "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law
   at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts;" -- where
   both a recital of his own duty, that he should be full of knowledge to
   instruct; the intimation to the people, that they should seek unto him,
   or give heed to his teaching; with the reason of them both, "For he is
   the Lord's messenger" (one of the highest titles of the ministers of
   the gospel, performing the same office), -- do abundantly confirm that
   instructing of the people in the moral worship of God was a duty of the
   priestly office, or of the priests as such, especially considering the
   effect of this teaching, mentioned verse 6, the "turning of many away
   from iniquity," the proper end of teaching in assemblies: all which we
   find exactly performed by an excellent priest, preaching to the people
   on a pulpit of wood, Neh. viii. 1-8. Farther; for a neglect of this,
   the priests are threatened with the rejection from their office, Hos.
   iv. 6. Now, it doth not seem justice that a man should be put out of
   his office for a neglect of that whose performance doth not belong unto
   it. The fault of every neglect ariseth from the description of a duty.
   Until something, then, of more force than any thing as yet I have seen
   be objected to the contrary, we may take it for granted that the
   teaching of the people under the law in public assemblies was performed
   ordinarily by the priests, as belonging to their duty and office. Men
   endued with gifts supernatural, extraordinarily called, and immediately
   sent by God himself for the instruction of his people, the reformation
   of his church, and foretelling things to come, -- such as were the
   prophets, who, whenever they met with opposition, stayed themselves
   upon their extraordinary calling, -- come not within the compass of my
   disquisition. The institution, also, of the schools of the prophets,
   the employment of the sons of the prophets, the original of the
   scribes, and those other possessors of Moses' chair in our Saviour's
   time, wherein he conversed here below, being necessarily to be handled
   in my observations on the fore-named treatise, I shall omit until more
   leisure and an enjoyment of the small remainder of my poor library
   shall better enable me. For the present, because treating "in causâ
   facili," although writing without books, I hope I am not beside the
   truth. The book of truth, praised be God, is easy to be obtained; and
   God is not tied to means in discovering the truth of that book.

   Come we, then, to the consideration of what duty in the service of God,
   beyond those belonging unto several families, were permitted to any of
   the people not peculiarly set apart for such a purpose. The ceremonial
   part of God's worship, as we saw before, was so appropriated to the
   priests that God usually revenged the transgression of that ordinance
   very severely. The examples of Uzzah and Uzziah [20] are dreadful
   testimonies of his wrath in that kind. It was an unalterable law by
   virtue whereof the priests excommunicated [21] that presumptuous king.
   For that which we chiefly intend, the public teaching of others, as to
   some it was enjoined as an act of their duty, so it might at first seem
   that it was permitted to all who, having ability thereunto, were called
   by charity or necessity. So the princes of Jehoshaphat taught the
   people out of the law of God, as well as the priests and Levites, 2
   Chron. xvii. 7-9. So also Nehemiah and others of the chiefs of the
   people are reckoned among them who taught the people, Neh. viii. 9. And
   afterward, when St Paul at any time entered into their synagogues, they
   never questioned any thing but his abilities; if he had "any word of
   exhortation for the people," he might "say on." [22] And the scribes,
   questioning the authority of our Saviour for his teaching, were moved
   to it, not because he taught, but because he taught so and such things,
   -- with authority and against their traditions; otherwise, they rather
   troubled themselves to think how he should become able to teach, Mark
   vi. 2, 3, than him be cause he did. There are, indeed, many sharp
   reproofs in the Old Testament of those who undertook to be God's
   messengers without his warrant; as Jer. xxii. 21, 22, "I have not sent
   these prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they
   prophesied. But if they had stood in my counsel," etc.; -- to which,
   and the like places, it may satisfactorily be answered, that howsoever,
   by the way of analogy, they may be drawn into rule for these times of
   the gospel, yet they were spoken only in reference to them who falsely
   pretended to extraordinary revelations and a power of foretelling
   things to come, whom the Lord forewarned his people of, and appointed
   punishments for them, Deut. xiii. 1-6; with which sort of pretenders
   that nation was ever replenished, for which the very heathen often
   derided them. He who makes it his employment to counterfeit God's
   dispensations had then no more glorious work to imitate than that of
   prophecy; wherein he was not idle. Yet, notwithstanding all this, I do
   not conceive the former discourse to be punctually true in the latitude
   thereof, as though it were permitted to all men, or any men, besides
   the priests and prophets, to teach publicly at all times, and in all
   estates of that church. Only, I conceive that the usual answers given
   to the fore-cited places, when objected, are not sufficient. Take an
   instance in one, 2 Chron. xvii. 7-9, of the princes of Jehoshaphat
   teaching with the priests. The author of the book before intimated
   conceives that neither priests nor princes taught at all in that way we
   now treat of, but only that the priests rode circuit to administer
   judgment, and had the princes with them to do execution. But this
   interpretation he borroweth only to confirm his proton pseudos, that
   priests did not teach as such. The very circumstance of the place
   enforces a contrary sense. And in chap. xix. 5-7, there is express
   mention of appointing judges for the determination of civil causes in
   every city; which evidently was a distinct work, distinguished from
   that mentioned in this place. And, upon the like ground, I conceive it
   to be no intimation of a movable sanhedrim; which, although of such a
   mixed constitution, yet was not itinerant, and is mentioned in that
   other place. Neither is that other ordinary gloss more probable, "They
   were sent to teach, that is, to countenance the teaching of the law,"
   -- a duty which seldom implores the assistance of human countenance;
   and if for the present it did, the king's authority commanding it was
   of more value than the presence of the princes. Besides, there is
   nothing in the text, nor the circumstances thereof, which should hold
   out this sense unto us; neither do we find any other rule, precept, or
   practice, whose analogy might lead us to such an interpretation. That
   which to me seems to come nearest the truth is, that they taught also,
   not in a ministerial way, like the priests and Levites, but imperially
   and judicially, declaring the sense of the law, the offences against
   it, and the punishments due to such offences, especially inasmuch as
   they had reference to the peace of the commonwealth; which differs not
   much from that which I rest upon, -- to wit, that in a collapsed and
   corrupted state of the church, when the ordinary teachers are either
   utterly ignorant and cannot, or negligent and will not, perform their
   duty, gifts in any one to be a teacher, and consent in others by him to
   be taught, are a sufficient warrant for the performance of it; and than
   this the places cited out of the Old Testament prove no more. For the
   proceedings of St Paul in the synagogues, their great want of teaching
   (being a people before forsaken of the Spirit, and then withering)
   might be a warrant for them to desire it, and his apostolical mission
   for him to do it. It doth not, then, at all from hence appear that
   there was then any liberty of teaching in public assemblies granted
   unto or assumed by any, in such an estate of the church as wherein it
   ought to be. When, indeed, it is ruinously declining, every one of
   God's servants hath a sufficient warrant to help or prevent the fall;
   this latter being but a common duty of zeal and charity, the former an
   authoritative act of the keys, the minister whereof is only an
   instrumental agent, that from whence it hath its efficacy residing in
   another, in whose stead, and under whose person it is done, 2 Cor. v.
   19, 20. Now, whoever doth any thing in another's stead, not by express
   patent from him, is a plain impostor; and a grant of this nature made
   unto all in general doth not appear. I am bold to speak of these things
   under the notion of the "keys," though in the time of the law; for I
   cannot assent to those schoolmen [23] who will not allow that the keys
   in any sense were granted to the legal priests. Their power of
   teaching, discerning, judging, receiving in and casting out, import the
   thing, though the name (no more than that of "regnum coelorum," as
   Jerome and Augustine observe) be not to be found in the Old Testament;
   and, doubtless, God ratified the execution of his own ordinances in
   heaven then as well as now. What the immediate effect of their services
   was, how far by their own force they reached, and what they typified,
   how in signification only, and not immediately, they extended to an
   admission into and exclusion from the heavenly tabernacle, and wherein
   lies the secret power of gospel commissions beyond theirs to attain the
   ultimate end, I have declared elsewhere. [24]

   Thus much of what the ancient people of God, distinguished from their
   priests, might not do; now briefly of what they might, or rather of
   what they ought, and what their obedience and profession declared that
   they thought themselves obliged unto. Private exhortations, rebukings,
   and such dictates of the law of nature, being presupposed, we find them
   farther "speaking often one to another" of those things which concerned
   the fear and worship of the Lord, Mal. iii. 16; by their "lips feeding
   many with wisdom," Prov. x. 21; discoursing of God's laws upon all
   occasions, Deut. vi. 6, 7; by multitudes encouraging each other to the
   service of God, Zech. viii. 20, 21, Isa. ii. 2, 3; jointly praising God
   with cheerful hearts, Ps. xlii. 4; giving and receiving mutual
   consolation, Ps. lv. 14; and all this, with much more of the same
   nature, at their meetings, either occasional or for that purpose
   indicted; -- always provided that they abstained from fingering the
   ark, or meddling with those things which were appropriated to the
   office of the priests, and concerning them hitherto.

Chapter III.

   Containing a digression concerning the name of "priests," the right of
   Christians thereunto by their interest in the priesthood of Christ,
   with the presumption of any particularly appropriating it to
   themselves.

   And now the transaction of these things in the Christian church
   presents itself to our consideration; in handling whereof I shall not
   at all discourse concerning the several church-officers instituted by
   Christ and his apostles for the edification of his body, nor concerning
   the difference between them who were partakers at first of an
   extraordinary vocation and those who since have been called to the same
   work in an ordinary manner, divinely appointed for the direction of the
   church. Neither yet doth that diversity of the administration of
   government in the churches, then when they were under the plenitude of
   apostolical power, and now when they follow rules prescribed for their
   reiglement, come in my way.

   Farther; who are the subject of the keys, in whom all that secondary
   ecclesiastical power which is committed to men doth reside, after the
   determinations of so many learned men by clear Scripture light, shall
   not by me be called in question. All these, though conducing to the
   business in hand, would require a large discussion; and such a
   scholastical handling as would make it an inconsutilous [25] piece of
   this popular discourse; my intent being only to show, -- seeing there
   are, as all acknowledge, some under the New Testament, as well as the
   Old, peculiarly set apart by God's own appointment for the
   administration of Christ's ordinances, especially teaching of others by
   preaching of the gospel, in the way of office and duty, -- what
   remaineth for the rest of God's people to do, for their own and others'
   edification.

   1. But here, before I enter directly upon the matter, I must remove one
   stone of offence, concerning the common appellation of those who are
   set apart for the preaching of the gospel. That which is most
   frequently used for them in the New Testament is diakonoi, so 1 Cor.
   iii. 5; 2 Cor. iii. 6, vi. 4, xi. 15, 23; 1 Tim. iv. 6, and in divers
   other places; to which add huperetai, 1 Cor. iv. 1, a word though of
   another original, yet of the same signification with the former, and
   both rightly translated "ministers." The names of "ambassadors,"
   "stewards," and the like, wherewith they are often honoured, are
   figurative, and given unto them by allusion only. That the former
   belonged unto them, and were proper for them, none ever denied but some
   Rabshakehs of antichrist. Another name there is, which some have
   assumed unto themselves as an honour, and others have imposed the same
   upon them for a reproach, namely, that of "priest;" which, to the
   takers, seemed to import a more mysterious employment, a greater
   advancement above the rest of their brethren, a nearer approach unto
   God, in the performances of their office, than that of "ministers;"
   wherefore they embraced it either voluntarily, alluding to the service
   of God and the administration thereof amongst his ancient people the
   Jews, or thought that they ought necessarily to undergo it, as
   belonging properly to them who are to celebrate those mysteries and
   offer those sacrifices which they imagined were to them prescribed. The
   imposers, on the contrary, pretend divers reasons why now that name can
   signify none but men rejected from God's work, and given up to
   superstitious vanities; attending, in their minds, the old priests of
   Baal, and the now shavelings of Antichrist. It was a new etymology of
   this name which that learned man cleaved unto, who, unhappily, was
   engaged into the defence of such errors as he could not but see and did
   often confess, [26] -- to which, also, he had an entrance made by an
   archbishop, [27] -- to wit, that it was but an abbreviation of
   "presbyters;" knowing full well, not only that the signification of
   these words is diverse amongst them to whom belong "jus et norma
   loquendi," but also that they are widely different in holy writ: yea,
   farther, that those who first dignified themselves with this title
   never called themselves presbyters by way of distinction from the
   people, but only to have a note of distance among themselves, there
   being more than one sort of them that were sacrificers, and which, "eo
   nomine," accounted themselves priests. Setting aside, then, all such
   evasions and distinctions as the people of God are not bound to take
   notice of, and taking the word in its ordinary acceptation, I shall
   briefly declare what I conceive of the use thereof, in respect of them
   who are ministers of the gospel; which I shall labour to clear by these
   following observations:--

   (1.) All faithful ministers of the gospel, inasmuch as they are
   ingrafted into Christ and are true believers, may, as all other true
   Christians, be called priests; but this inasmuch as they are members of
   Christ, not ministers of the gospel. It respecteth their persons, not
   their function, or not them as such. Now, I conceive it may give some
   light to this discourse if we consider the grounds and reasons of this
   metaphorical appellation, in divers places of the gospel ascribed to
   the worshippers of Christ, [28] and how the analogy which the present
   dispensation holds with what was established under the administration
   of the Old Testament may take place; for there we find the Lord thus
   bespeaking his people, "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and
   an holy nation," Exod. xix. 6: so that it should seem that there was
   then a twofold priesthood; -- a ritual priesthood, conferred upon the
   tribe of Levi; and a royal priesthood, belonging to the whole people.
   The first is quite abrogated and swallowed up in the priesthood of
   Christ; the other is put over unto us under the gospel, being ascribed
   to them and us, and every one in covenant with God, not directly and
   properly, as denoting the function peculiarly so called, but
   comparatively, with reference had to them that are without: for as
   those who were properly called priests had a nearer access unto God
   than the rest of the people, especially in his solemn worship, so all
   the people that are in covenant with God have such an approximation
   Unto him by virtue thereof, in comparison of them that are without,
   that in respect thereof they are said to be priests. Now, the outward
   covenant, made with them who were the children of Abraham after the
   flesh, was representative of the covenant of grace made with the
   children of promise, and that whole people typified the hidden elect
   people of God; so that of both there is the same reason. Thus, as "the
   priests the sons of Levi" are said to "come near unto God," Deut. xxi.
   5, and God tells them that "him whom he hath chosen, he will cause to
   come near unto him," Num. xvi. 5, -- chosen by a particular calling "ad
   munus," to the office of the ritual priesthood; so in regard of that
   other kind, comparatively so called, it is said of the whole people,
   "What nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the
   Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?" Deut. iv. 7.
   Their approaching nigh unto God made them all a nation of priests, in
   comparison of those "dogs" and unclean Gentiles that were out of the
   covenant. Now, this prerogative is often appropriated to the faithful
   in the New Testament: for "through Christ we have access by one Spirit
   unto the Father," Eph. ii. 18; and chap. iii. 12, "We have boldness and
   access with confidence;" so James iv. 8, "Draw nigh to God, and he will
   draw nigh to you;" -- which access and approximation unto God seemed,
   as before was spoken, to be uttered in allusion to the priests of the
   old law, who had this privilege above others in the public worship, in
   which respect only things then were typical; since, because we enjoy
   that prerogative in the truth of the thing itself, which they had only
   in type, we also are called priests. And as they were said to "draw
   nigh" in reference to the rest of the people, so we in respect of them
   who are "strangers from the covenants," that now are said to be "afar
   off;" Eph. ii. 17, and hereafter shall be "without;" for "without are
   dogs," etc., Rev. xxii. 15. Thus, this metaphorical appellation of
   priests is, in the first place an intimation of that transcendent
   privilege of grace and favour which Jesus Christ hath purchased for
   every one that is sanctified with the blood of the covenant.

   (2.) We have an interest in this appellation of priests by virtue of
   our union with Christ. Being one with our high priest, we also are
   priests. There is a twofold union between Christ and us; -- the one, by
   his taking upon him our nature; the other, by bestowing on us his
   Spirit: for as in his incarnation he took upon him our flesh and blood
   by the work of the Spirit, so in our regeneration he bestoweth on us
   his flesh and blood by the operation of the same Spirit. Yea, so strict
   is this latter union which we have with Christ, that as the former is
   truly said to be a union of two natures into one person, so this of
   many persons into one nature; for by it we are "made partakers of the
   divine nature," 2 Pet. i. 4, becoming "members of his body, of his
   flesh, and of his bones," Eph. v. 30. We are so parts of him, of his
   mystical body, that we and he become thereby, as it were, one Christ:
   "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of
   that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ, 1 Cor. xii.
   12. And the ground of this is, because the same Spirit is in him and
   us. In him, indeed, dwelleth the fulness of it, when it is bestowed
   upon us only by measure; but yet it is still the same Spirit, and so
   makes us, according to his own prayer, one with him, as the soul of
   man, being one, makes the whole body with it to be but one man. Two men
   cannot be one, because they have two souls; no more could we be one
   with Christ were it not the same Spirit in him and us. Now, let a man
   be never so big or tall, so that his feet rest upon the earth and his
   head reach to heaven, yet, having but one soul, he is still but one
   man. Now, though Christ for the present, in respect of our nature
   assumed, be never so far remote and distant from us in heaven, yet, by
   the effectual energy and inhabitation of the same Spirit, he is still
   the head of that one body whereof we are members, still but one with
   us. Hence ariseth to us a twofold right to the title of priests:--

   [1.] Because being in him, and members of him, we are accounted to have
   done, in him and with him, whatsoever he hath done for us: We are "dead
   with him," Rom. vi. 8; "buried with him," verse 4; "quickened together
   with him," Eph. ii. 5; "risen with him," Col. iii. 1; being "raised
   up," we "sit together with him in heavenly places," Eph. ii. 6. Now,
   all these in Christ were in some sense sacerdotal; wherefore we, having
   an interest in their performance, by reason of that heavenly
   participation derived from them unto us, and being united unto him that
   in them was so properly, are therefore called priests.

   [2.] By virtue of this union there is such an analogy between that
   which Christ hath done for us as a priest and what he worketh in us by
   his Holy Spirit, that those acts of ours come to be called by the same
   name with his, and we for them to be termed priests. Thus, because
   Christ's death and shedding of his blood, so offering up himself by the
   eternal Spirit, was a true, proper sacrifice for sin, even our
   spiritual death unto sin is described to be such, both in the nature of
   it, to be an offering or sacrifice (for, "I beseech you, brethren,"
   saith St Paul, "by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a
   living sacrifice," etc., Rom. xii. 1), and for the manner of it; our
   "old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be
   destroyed,'' Rom. vi. 6.

   (3.) We are priests as we are Christians, or partakers of a holy
   unction, whereby we are anointed to the participation of all Christ's
   glorious offices. We are not called Christians for nothing. If truly we
   are so, then have we an "unction from the Holy One," whereby we "know
   all things," 1 John ii. 20. And thus also were all God's people under
   the old covenant, when God gave that caution concerning them, "Touch
   not my Christians, [29] and do my prophets no harm," Ps. cv. 15. The
   unction, then, of the Holy Spirit implies a participation of all those
   endowments which were typified by the anointing with oil in the Old
   Testament, and invests us with the privileges, in a spiritual
   acceptation, of all the sorts of men which then were so anointed, -- to
   wit, of kings, priests, and prophets: so that by being made Christians
   (every one is not so that bears that name), we are ingrafted into
   Christ, and do attain to a kind of holy and intimate communion with him
   in all his glorious offices; and in that regard are called priests.

   (4.) The sacrifices we are enjoined to offer give ground to this
   appellation. Now, they are of divers sorts, though all in general
   eucharistical; -- as, first, Of prayers and thanksgivings: Ps. cxvi.
   17, "I will offer unto thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
   call upon the name of the Lord;" and again, "Let my prayer be set forth
   before thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening
   sacrifice." Ps. cxli. 2: so Heb. xiii. 15, "Let us offer the sacrifice
   of praise to God," -- that is, the "fruit of our lips." Secondly, Of
   good works: Heb. xiii. 16, "To do good and to communicate forget not;
   for with such sacrifices God is well pleased." Thirdly, Autothusias, or
   self slaughter, crucifying the old man, killing sin, and offering up
   our souls and bodies an acceptable sacrifice unto God, Rom. xii. 1.
   Fourthly, The sweet incense of martyrdom: "Yea, and if I be offered
   upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, etc., Phil. ii. 17. Now,
   these and sundry other services acceptable to God, receiving this
   appellation in the Scripture, denominate the performers of them
   priests. Now, here it must be observed, that these aforenamed holy
   duties are called "sacrifices," not properly, but metaphorically only,
   -- not in regard of the external acts, as were those under the law, but
   in regard of the internal purity of heart from whence they proceed. And
   because pure sacrifices, by his own appointment, were heretofore the
   most acceptable service of Almighty God, therefore now, when he would
   declare himself to be very much delighted with the spiritual acts of
   our duty, he calls them "oblations," "incense," "sacrifices,"
   "offerings," etc.; to intimate, also, a participation with Him in his
   offices who properly and directly is the only priest of his church, and
   by the communication of the virtue of whose sacrifice we are made
   priests, not having authority in our own names to go unto God for
   others, but having liberty, through him, and in his name, to go unto
   God for ourselves.

   Not to lose myself and reader in this digression, the sum is, -- The
   unspeakable blessings which the priesthood of Christ hath obtained for
   us are a strong obligation for the duty of praise and thanksgiving; of
   which that in some measure we may discharge ourselves, he hath
   furnished us with sacrifices of that kind to be offered unto God. For
   our own parts, we are poor, and blind, and lame, and naked; neither in
   the field nor in the fold, in our hearts nor among our actions, can we
   find any thing worth the presenting unto him: wherefore, he himself
   provides them for us; especially for that purpose sanctifying and
   consecrating our souls and bodies with the sprinkling of his blood and
   the unction of the Holy Spirit. Farther; he hath erected an altar (to
   sanctify our gifts) in heaven, before the throne of grace, which, being
   spread over with his blood, is consecrated unto God, that the
   sacrifices of his servants may for ever appear thereon. Add to this,
   what he also hath added, the eternal and never-expiring fire of the
   favour of God, which kindleth and consumes the sacrifices laid on that
   altar. And to the end that all this may be rightly accomplished, he
   hath consecrated us with his blood to be kings and priests to God for
   evermore. So that the close of this discourse will be, that all true
   believers, by virtue of their interest in Jesus Christ, are in the holy
   Scripture, by reason of divers allusions called priests; which name, in
   the sense before related, belonging unto them as such, cannot, on this
   ground, be ascribed to any part of them distinguished any ways from the
   rest by virtue of such distinction.

   2. The second thing I observe concerning the business in hand is, that
   the offering up unto God of some metaphorical sacrifices, in a peculiar
   manner, is appropriate unto men set apart for the work of the ministry;
   as the slaying of men's lusts, and the offering up of them, being
   converted by the preaching of the gospel, unto God. So St Paul of his
   ministry, Rom. xv. 16, "That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ
   unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up
   of the Gentiles might be acceptable," etc. Ministers preaching the
   gospel to the conversion of souls are said to kill men's lusts, and
   offer them up unto God as the fruit of their calling, as Abel brought
   unto him an acceptable sacrifice of the fruit of his flock; and so also
   in respect of divers other acts of their duty, which they perform in
   the name of their congregations. Now, these sacrifices are appropriated
   to the ministers of the gospel, not in regard of the matter, -- for
   others also may convert souls unto God, and offer up prayers and
   praises in the name of their companions, -- but in respect of the
   manner: they do it publicly and ordinarily; others, privately or in
   extraordinary cases. Now, if the ministers, who are thus God's
   instruments for the conversion of souls, be themselves ingrafted into
   Christ, all the acts they perform in that great work are but parts of
   their own duty, of the same nature in that regard with the rest of our
   spiritual sacrifices; so that they have not by them any farther,
   peculiar interest in the office of the priesthood more than others. But
   if these preachers themselves do not belong unto the covenant of grace,
   as God oftentimes, out of his care for his flock, bestows gifts upon
   some for the good of others, on whom he will bestow no graces for the
   benefit of their own souls, men may administer that consolation out of
   the word unto their flock which themselves never tasted, -- preach to
   others, and be themselves cast-aways. St Paul tells us that some preach
   Christ out of envy and contention, not sincerely, but on purpose to add
   to his affliction; and yet, saith he, "whether in pretence, or in
   truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
   rejoice, Phil. i. 16-18. Surely, had there been no good effected by
   such preaching, St Paul would not have rejoiced in it; and yet,
   doubtless, it was no evidence of sanctification to preach Christ merely
   out of contention, and on purpose to add to the affliction of his
   servants. But, I say, if the Lord shall be pleased at any time to make
   use of such as instruments in his glorious work of converting souls,
   shall we think that it is looked upon as their sacrifice unto God? No,
   surely. The soul of the Lord is delighted with the repentance of
   sinners; but all the sacrifices of these wicked men are an abomination
   unto him, and therefore they have no interest in it. Neither can they
   from hence be said to be priests of God, seeing they continue "dogs"
   and "unclean beasts," etc. So that all the right unto this priestly
   office seems to be resolved into, and to be the same with, the common
   interest of all believers in Christ, whereby they have a participation
   of his office. Whence I affirm, --

   3. That the name of priests is nowhere in the Scripture attributed
   peculiarly and distinctively to the ministers of the gospel as such.
   Let any produce an instance to the contrary, and this controversy is at
   an end. Yea, that which puts a difference between them and the rest of
   the people of God's holiness seems to be a more immediate participation
   of Christ's prophetical office, to teach, instruct, and declare the
   will of God unto men; and not of his sacerdotal, to offer sacrifices
   for men unto God. Now, I could never observe that any of those who were
   so forward of late to style themselves priests were at all greedy of
   the appellation of prophets. No; this they were content to let go, name
   and thing. And yet, when Christ ascended on high, he gave some to be
   prophets, for the edification of his body, Eph. iv. 11; none, as we
   find, to be priests. Priests, then (like prelates), are a sort of
   church-officers whom Christ never appointed. Whence I conclude, --

   4. That whosoever maintaineth any priests of the New Testament as
   properly so called, in relation to any altar or sacrifice by them to be
   offered, doth as much as in him lieth disannul the covenant of grace,
   and is blasphemously injurious to the priesthood of Christ. The priest
   and the sacrifice under the New Testament are one and the same; and
   therefore, they who make themselves priests must also make themselves
   Christs, or get another sacrifice of their own. As there is but "one
   God," so there is but "one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
   Jesus," 1 Tim. ii. 5. Now, he became the mediator of the New Testament
   chiefly by his priesthood, because "through the eternal Spirit he
   offered himself to God," Heb. ix. 14, 15. Neither is any now called of
   God to be a priest, as was Aaron; and without such divine vocation to
   this office none ought to undertake it, as the apostle argues, Heb. v.
   4. Now, the end of any such vocation and office is quite ceased, being
   nothing but to "offer gifts and sacrifices" unto God, Heb. viii. 3: for
   Christ hath offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, and is "set down
   at the right hand of God," chap. x. 12; yea, "by one offering he hath
   perfected for ever them that are sanctified," verse 14; and if that did
   procure remission of sins, there must be "no more offering for sin,"
   verse 18; and the surrogation of another makes the blood of Christ to
   be no better than that of bulls and goats. Now, one of these they must
   do who make themselves priests (in that sense concerning which we now
   treat), -- either get them a new sacrifice of their own, or pretend to
   offer Christ again. [30] The first seems to have been the fault of
   those of ours who made a sacrifice of the sacrament, yet pretended not
   to believe the real presence of Christ in or under the outward elements
   or species of them; the other of the Romanists, whose priests in their
   mass blasphemously make themselves mediators between God and his Son,
   and offering up Christ Jesus for a sacrifice, desire God to accept him,
   -- so charging that sacrifice with imperfection which he offered on the
   altar of the cross, and making it necessary not only that he should
   annually, but daily, yea hourly, suffer afresh, so recrucifying unto
   themselves the Lord of glory. Farther; themselves confessing that, to
   be a true sacrifice, it is required that that which is offered unto God
   be destroyed, and cease to be what it was, they do confess by what lies
   in them to destroy the Son of God; and by their mass have
   transubstantiated their altars into crosses, their temples into
   Golgothas, their prelates into Pilates, their priests into hangmen,
   tormentors of Jesus Christ! Concerning them and ours, we may shut up
   this discourse with what the apostle intimates to the Hebrews, --
   namely, that all priests are ceased who were mortal. Now, small cause
   have we to believe them to be immaterial spirits, among whom we find
   the works of the flesh to have been so frequent.

   And this may give us some light into the iniquity of those times
   whereinto we were lately fallen; in which lord bishops and priests had
   almost quite oppressed the bishops of the Lord and ministers of the
   gospel. How unthankful men were we for the light of the gospel! -- men
   that loved darkness rather than light. "A wonderful and horrible thing
   was committed in the land; the prophets prophesied falsely, the priests
   bare rule by their means;" almost the whole "people loved to have it
   so: and what will we now do in the end thereof?" Jer. v. 30, 31. Such a
   hasty apostasy was growing on us as we might justly wonder at, because
   unparalleled in any church, of any age. But our revolters were profound
   hasty men, and eager in their master's service. So, what a height of
   impiety and opposition to Christ the Roman apostasy in a thousand years
   attained unto! and yet I dare aver that never so many errors and
   suspicions in a hundred years crept into that church as did into ours
   of England in sixteen. And yet I cannot herein give the commendation of
   so much as industry to our innovators (I accuse not the whole church,
   but particulars in it, and that had seized themselves of its
   authority), because they had a platform before them, and materials
   provided to their hand, and therefore it was an easy thing for them to
   erect a Babel of antichristian confusion, when the workmen in the Roman
   apostasy were forced to build in the plain of Christianity without any
   pre-existent materials, but were fain to use brick and slime of their
   own provision. Besides, they were unacquainted with the main design of
   Satan, who set them on work, and therefore it is no wonder if those
   Nimrods ofttimes hunted counter, and disturbed each other in their
   progress. Yea, the first mover in church apostasy knows that now his
   time is but short, and therefore it behoves him to make speedy work in
   seducing, lest he be prevented by the coming of Christ.

   Then, having himself a long tract of time granted unto him, he allowed
   his agents to take leisure also; but what he doth now must be done
   quickly, or his whole design will be quashed: and this made him inspire
   the present business with so much life and vigour. Moreover, he was
   compelled then to sow his tares in the dark, "while men slept," --
   taking advantage of the ignorance and embroilment of the times. If any
   man had leisure enough to search, and learning enough to see and find
   him at it, he commonly filled the world with clamours against him, and
   scarce any but his avowed champions durst be his advocates. In our time
   he was grown bold and impudent, working at noonday; yea, he openly
   accused and condemned all that durst accuse him for sowing any thing
   but good wheat, that durst say that the tares of his Arminianism and
   Popery were any thing but true doctrine. Let us give so much way to
   indignation. We know Satan's trade what it is, -- to accuse the
   brethren: as men are called after their professions, one a lawyer,
   another a physician, so is he "The accuser of the brethren." Now
   surely, if ever he set up a shop on earth to practice his trade in, it
   was our High Commission Court, as of late employed; but apechesthe.

Chapter IV.

   Of the duty of God's people in cases extraordinary concerning his
   worship.

   This being thus determined, I return again to the main zetoumenon,
   concerning the duty and privilege of the common people of Christianity
   in sacred things; and, first, in cases extraordinary, in which,
   perhaps, it may be affirmed that every one (of those, I mean, before
   named) is so far a minister of the gospel as to teach and declare the
   faith to others, although he have no outward calling thereunto. And
   yet, in this case, every one for such an undertaking must have a
   warrant by an immediate call from God. And when God calls there must be
   no opposition; the thing itself he sends us upon becomes lawful by his
   mission: "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common," Acts x.
   15. Never fear the equity of what God sets thee upon. No excuses of
   disability or any other impediment ought to take place; the Lord can
   and will supply all such defects. This was Moses' case, Exod. iv. 10,
   11: "O my Lord," saith he," I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor
   since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and
   of a slow tongue. And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's
   mouth? have not I the Lord?" So also was it with the prophet Jeremiah.
   When God told him that he had ordained him a prophet unto the nations,
   he replies, "Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.
   But the Lord," saith he, "said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou
   shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee
   thou shalt speak," Jer. i. 6, 7. Nothing can excuse any from going on
   His message who can perfect his praise out of the mouths of babes and
   sucklings. This the prophet Amos rested upon when he was questioned,
   although he were unfit for that heavenly employment either by education
   or course of life: "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son;
   but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: and the Lord
   took me as I followed the flock, and said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my
   people Israel," Amos vii. 14, 15. So, on the contrary, St Paul, a man
   of strong parts, great learning, and endowments, of indefatigable
   industry and large abilities, yet affirms of himself that when God
   called him to preach his word, he "conferred not with flesh and blood,"
   but went on presently with his work, Gal. i. 15-17.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter V.

   Of the several ways of extraordinary calling to the teaching of others
   -- The first way.

   Now, three ways may a man receive, and be assured that he hath
   received, this divine mission, or know that he is called of God to the
   preaching of the word; I mean not that persuasion of divine concurrence
   which is necessary also for them that are partakers of an ordinary
   vocation, but that which is required in extraordinary cases to them in
   whom all outward calling is wanting:-- 1. By immediate revelation; 2.
   By a concurrence of Scripture rules directory for such occasions; 3. By
   some outward acts of Providence, necessitating him thereunto.

   For the first, -- not to speak of light prophetical, whether it
   consists in a habit, or rather in a transient irradiating motion, nor
   to discourse of the species whereby supernatural things are conveyed to
   the natural faculty, with the several ways of divine revelation (for St
   Paul affirmeth it to have been polutropos as well as polumeros), with
   the sundry appellations it received from the manner whereby it came, --
   I shall only show what assurance such a one as is thus called may have
   in himself that he is so called, and how he may manifest it unto
   others. That men receiving any revelation from God had always an
   assurance that such it was, to me seems most certain: neither could I
   ever approve the note of Gregory on Ezek. i.., -- namely, "That
   prophets, being accustomed to prophesying, did oftentimes speak of
   their own spirit, supposing that it proceeded from the Spirit of
   prophecy." [31] What is this but to question the truth of all
   prophetical revelations, and to shake the faith that is built upon it?
   Surely the prophet Jeremiah had an infallible assurance of the author
   of his message, when he pleaded for himself before the princes, "Of a
   truth the Lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your
   ears," chap. xxvi. 15. And Abraham certainly had need of a good
   assurance whence that motion did proceed which made him address himself
   to the sacrificing the son of promise. And that all other prophets had
   the like evidence of knowledge concerning the divine verity of their
   revelations is unquestionable. Hence are those allusions in the
   Scripture, whereby it is compared unto things whereof we may be most
   certain by the assurance of sense. So Amos iii. 8, "The lion hath
   roared, who will not fear? the Lord God hath spoken, who can but
   prophesy?" and Jer. xx. 9, "His word was in mine heart as a burning
   fire shut up in my bones;" -- things sensible enough. Haply Satan may
   so far delude false prophets as to make them suppose their lying
   vanities are from above; whence they are said to be "prophets of the
   deceit of their own heart," Jer. xxiii. 26, being deceived as well as
   deceivers, thinking in themselves as well as speaking unto others, "He
   saith," verse 31. But that any true prophets should not know a true
   revelation from a motion of their own hearts wants not much of
   blasphemy. The Lord surely supposes that assurance of discerning when
   he gives that command, "The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a
   dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What
   is the chaff to the wheat?" Jer. xxiii. 28. He must be both blind and
   mad that shall mistake wheat for chaff, and on the contrary. What some
   men speak of a hidden instinct from God moving the minds of men, yet so
   as they know not whether it be from him or no, may better serve to
   illustrate Plutarch's discourse of Socrates' demon than any passage in
   holy writ. St Austin says his mother would affirm, that though she
   could not express it, yet she could discern the difference between
   God's revelation and her own dreams; [32] in which relation I doubt not
   but the learned father took advantage, from the good old woman's words
   of what she could do, to declare what might be done of every one that
   had such immediate revelations. Briefly, then; the Spirit of God never
   so extraordinarily moveth the mind of man to apprehend any thing of
   this kind whereof we speak, but it also illustrateth it with a
   knowledge and assurance that it is divinely moved to this apprehension.
   Now, because it is agreed on all sides that light prophetical is no
   permanent habit in the minds of the prophets, but a transient
   impression, of itself not apt to give any such assurance, it may be
   questioned from what other principle it doth proceed. But, not to pry
   into things perhaps not fully revealed, and seeing St Paul shows us
   that, in such heavenly raptures, there are some things unutterable of
   them and incomprehensible of us, we may let this rest amongst those
   arrheta. It appeareth, then, from the preceding discourse, that a man
   pretending to extraordinary vocation by immediate revelation, in
   respect of self-persuasion of the truth of his call, must be as
   ascertained of it as he could be of a burning fire in his bones, if
   there shut up.

Chapter VI.

   What assurance men extraordinarily called can give to others that they
   are so called in the former way.

   The next thing to be considered is, what assurance he can give to
   others, and by what means, that he is so called. Now, the matter or
   subject of their employment may give us some light to this
   consideration; and this is, either the inchoation of some divine work
   to be established amongst men, by virtue of a new and
   never-before-heard-of revelation of God's will, or a restoration of the
   same, when collapsed and corrupted by the sin of men. To the first of
   these: God never sendeth any but whom he doth so extraordinarily and
   immediately call and ordain for that purpose; and that this may be
   manifested unto others, he always accompanieth them with his own
   almighty power, in the working of such miracles as may make them be
   believed, for the very works' sake which God by them doth effect. This
   we may see in Moses and (after Jesus Christ, anointed with the oil of
   gladness above his fellows to preach the gospel) the apostles. But this
   may pass, for nothing in such a way shall ever again take place, God
   having ultimately revealed his mind concerning his worship and our
   salvation, a curse being denounced to man or angel that shall pretend
   to revelation for the altering or changing one jot or tittle of the
   gospel. For the other, the work of reformation, there being, ever since
   the writing of his word, an infallible rule for the performance of it,
   making it fall within the duty and ability of men partaking of an
   ordinary vocation, and instructed with ordinary gifts, God doth not
   always immediately call men unto it; but yet, because oftentimes he
   hath so done, we may inquire what assurance they could give of this
   their calling to that employment. Our Saviour Christ informs us that a
   prophet is often without honour in his own country. The honour of a
   prophet is to have credence given to his message (of which, it should
   seem, Jonah was above measure zealous); yet such is the cursed
   infidelity and hardness of men's hearts, that though they cried, "Thus
   saith the Lord," yet they would reply, "The Lord hath not spoken."
   Hence are those pleadings betwixt the prophet Jeremiah and his enemies;
   the prophet averring, "Of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto you," and
   they contesting that the Lord had not sent him, but that he lied in the
   name of the Lord. Now, to leave them inexcusable, and, whether they
   would hear or whether they would forbear, to convince them that there
   hath been a prophet amongst them, as also to give the greater
   credibility to their extraordinary message to them that were to believe
   their report, it is necessary that "the arm of the Lord should be
   revealed," working in and by them in some extraordinary manner. It is
   certain enough that God never sent any one extraordinarily, instructed
   only with ordinary gifts and for an ordinary end. The aim of their
   employment I showed before was extraordinary, even the reparation of
   something instituted by God and collapsed by the sin of man. That it
   may be credible, or appear of a truth that God had sent them for this
   purpose, they were always furnished with such gifts and abilities as
   the utmost reach of human endeavours, with the assistance of common
   grace, cannot possibly attain. The general opinion is, that God always
   supplies such with the gift of miracles. Take the word in a large
   sense, for every supernatural product, beyond the ordinary activity of
   that secondary cause whereby it is effected, and I easily grant it; but
   in the usual restrained acceptation of it, for outward wonderful works,
   the power of whose production consists in operation, I something doubt
   the universal truth of the assertion. We do not read of any such
   miracles wrought by the prophet Amos, and yet he stands upon his
   extraordinary immediate vocation, "I was no prophet, neither was I a
   prophet's son, but the Lord took me," etc. It sufficeth, then, that
   they be furnished with a supernatural power, either in, -- 1.
   Discerning; 2. Speaking; or 3. Working. First, The power of discerning,
   according to the things by it discernible, may be said to be of two
   sorts: for it is either of things present, beyond the power of human
   investigation, as to know the thoughts of other men's hearts, or their
   words not ordinarily to be known, -- as Elisha discovered the
   bed-chamber discourse of the king of Syria (not that by virtue of their
   calling they come to be kardiognostai, "knowers of the heart," which is
   God's property alone, but that God doth sometimes reveal such things
   unto them; for otherwise no such power is included in the nature of the
   gift, which is perfective of their knowledge, not by the way of habit,
   but actual motion in respect of some particulars; and when this was
   absent, the same Elisha affirmeth that he knew not why the Shunammitish
   woman was troubled); or, secondly, of things future and contingent in
   respect of their secondary causes, not precisely necessitated by their
   own internal principle of operation for the effecting of the things so
   foreknown; and, therefore, the truth of the foreknowledge consists in a
   commensuration to God's purpose. Now, effects of this power are all
   those predictions of such things which we find in the Old and New
   Testament, and divers also since. Secondly, The supernatural gift in
   speaking I intimate is that of tongues, proper to the times of the
   gospel, when the worship of God was no longer to be confined to the
   people of one nation. The third, working, is that which strictly and
   properly is called the gift of miracles, which are hard, rare, and
   strange effects, exceeding the whole order of created nature, for whose
   production God sometimes useth his servants instrumentally, moving and
   enabling them thereunto by a transient impression of his powerful
   grace; of which sort the holy Scripture hath innumerable relations.
   Now, with one of those extraordinary gifts at least, sometimes with
   all, doth the Lord furnish those his messengers of whom we treat; which
   makes their message a sufficient revelation of God's will, and gives it
   credibility enough to stir up faith in some, and leave others
   inexcusable. All the difficulty is, that there have been Simon Maguses,
   and there are Antichrists, falsely pretending to have in themselves
   this mighty power of God, in one or other of the forenamed kinds. Hence
   were those many false prophets, dreamers, and wizards mentioned in the
   Old Testament, which the Lord himself forewarns us of; as also those
   agents of that man of sin, "whose coming is after the working of Satan,
   with all power and signs and lying wonders," 2 Thess. ii. 9. I mean the
   juggling priests and Jesuits, pretending falsely by their impostures to
   the power of miracle-working, though their employment be not to reform,
   but professedly to corrupt the worship of God. Now, in such a case as
   this, we have, -- 1. The mercy of God to rely upon, whereby he will
   guide his into the way of truth; and the purpose or decree of God,
   making it impossible that his elect should be deceived by them. 2.
   Human diligence, accompanied with God's blessing, may help us
   wonderfully in a discovery whether the pretended miracles be of God or
   no, for there is nothing more certain than that a true and real miracle
   is beyond the activity of all created power (for if it be not, it is
   not a miracle); so that the devil and all his emissaries are not able
   to effect any one act truly miraculous, but in all their pretences
   there is a defect discernible, either in respect of the thing itself
   pretended to be done, or of the manner of its doing, not truly
   exceeding the power of art or nature, though the apprehension of it, by
   reason of some hell-conceived circumstances, be above our capacity.
   Briefly: either the thing is a lie, and so it is easy to feign
   miracles; or the performance of it is pure juggling, and so it is easy
   to delude poor mortals. Innumerable of this sort, at the beginning of
   the Reformation, were discovered among the agents of that
   wonder-working "man of sin," by the blessing of God upon human
   endeavours. Now, from such discoveries a good conclusion may be drawn
   against the doctrine they desire by such means to confirm; for as God
   never worketh true miracles but for the confirmation of the truth, so
   will not men pretend such as are false, but to persuade that to others
   for a truth which themselves have just reason to be persuaded is a lie.
   Now, if this means fail, -- 3. God himself hath set down a rule of
   direction for us in the time of such difficulty: Deut. xiii. 1-5, "If
   there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth
   thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass,
   whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which
   thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto
   the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your
   God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all
   your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the Lord your
   God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and
   ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. And that prophet, or that
   dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death." The sum is, that seeing such
   men pretend that their revelations and miracles are from heaven, let us
   search whether the doctrine they seek to confirm by them be from heaven
   or no. If it be not, let them be stoned or accursed, for they seek to
   draw us from our God; if it be, let not the curse of a stony heart, to
   refuse them, be upon us. Where the miracles are true, the doctrine
   cannot be false; and if the doctrine be true, in all probability the
   miracles confining it are not false. And so much of them who are
   immediately called of God from heaven, [as to] what assurance they may
   have in themselves of such a call, and what assurance they can make of
   it to others. Now, such are not to expect any ordinary vocation from
   men below, God calling them aside to his work from the midst of their
   brethren. The Lord of the harvest may send labourers into his field
   without asking his steward's consent, and they shall speak whatever he
   saith unto them.

Chapter VII.

   The second way whereby a man may be called extraordinarily.

   Secondly, A man may be extraordinarily called to the preaching and
   publishing of God's word by a concurrence of Scripture rules, directory
   for such occasions, occurrences, and opportunities of time, place, and
   persons, as he liveth in and under. Rules in this kind may be drawn
   either from express precept or approved practice. Some of these I shall
   intimate, and leave it to the indifferent reader to judge whether or no
   they hold in the application; and all that in this kind I shall
   propose, I do with submission to better judgments.

   1. Consider, then, that of our Saviour to St Peter, Luke xxii. 32,
   "When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren;" which containing
   nothing but an application of one of the prime dictates of the law of
   nature, cannot, ought not, to be restrained unto men of any peculiar
   calling as such. Not to multiply many of this kind (whereof in the
   Scripture is plenty), add only that of St James, James v. 19, 20,
   "Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him,
   let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his
   way shall save a soul from death," etc. From these and the like places
   it appears to me, that, --

   There is a general obligation on all Christians to promote the
   conversion and instruction of sinners, and men erring from the right
   way.

   2. Again, consider that of our Saviour, Matt. v. 15, "Men do not light
   a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth
   light unto all that are in the house;" to which add that of the
   apostle, "If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
   first hold his peace," 1 Cor. xiv. 30: which words, although primarily
   they intend extraordinary immediate revelations, yet I see no reason
   why in their equity and extent they may not be directory for the use of
   things revealed unto us by Scripture light. At least, we may deduce
   from them, by the way of analogy, that, --

   Whatsoever necessary truth is revealed to any out of the word of God,
   not before known, he ought to have an uncontradicted liberty of
   declaring that truth, provided that he use such regulated ways for that
   his declaration as the church wherein he liveth (if a right church)
   cloth allow.

   3. Farther, see Amos iii. 8, "The lion hath roared, who will not fear?
   the Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy?" and Jer. xx. 9, "Then
   I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name.
   But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones;
   and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay;" with the answer
   of Peter and John to the rulers of the Jews, Acts iv. 19, 20, "Whether
   it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,
   judge ye; for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
   heard." Whence it appears, that, --

   Truth revealed unto any carries along with it an unmovable persuasion
   of conscience (which is powerfully obligatory) that it ought to be
   published and spoken to others.

   That none may take advantage of this to introduce confusion into our
   congregations, I gave a sufficient caution in the second rule.

   Many other observations giving light to the business in hand might be
   taken from the common dictates of nature, concurring with many general
   precepts we have in the Scripture, but, omitting them, the next thing I
   propose is the practice, etc., --

   1. Of our Saviour Christ himself, who did not only pose the doctors
   when he was but twelve years old, Luke ii. 46, but also afterward
   preached in the synagogue of Nazareth, chap. iv. 16-22, being neither
   doctor, nor scribe, nor Levite, but of the tribe of Judah (concerning
   which tribe it is evident that Moses spake nothing concerning the
   priesthood).

   2. Again, in the eighth of the Acts, great persecution arising against
   the church after the death of Stephen, "they were all scattered abroad
   from Jerusalem," verse 1, -- that is, all the faithful members of the
   church, -- who being thus dispersed, "went everywhere preaching the
   word," verse 4; and to this their publishing of the gospel (having no
   warrant but the general engagement of all Christians to further the
   propagation of Christ's kingdom), occasioned by their own persecution,
   the Lord gave such a blessing, that they were thereby the first
   planters of a settled congregation among the Gentiles, they and their
   converts being the first that were honoured by the name of Christians,
   Acts xi. 21, 26.

   3. Neither is the example of St Paul altogether impertinent, who with
   his companions repaired unto the synagogues of the Jews, and taught
   them publicly, yea, upon their own request, Acts xiii. 15. Apollos also
   spake boldly and preached fervently when he knew only the baptism of
   John, and needed himself farther instruction. Acts xviii. 24-26. It
   should seem, then, in that juncture of time, he that was instructed in
   any truth not ordinarily known might publicly acquaint others with it,
   though he himself were ignorant in other points of high concernment;
   yet, perhaps, now it is not possible that any occurrences should
   require a precise imitation of what was not only lawful but also
   expedient in that dawning towards the clear day of the last
   unchangeable revelation of God's will. Now, in these and the like there
   is so much variety, such several grounds and circumstances, that no
   direct rule can from them be drawn; only, they may give strength to
   what from the former shall be concluded.

   For a farther light to this discourse, consider what desolate estate
   the church of God hath been, may be, and at this present in divers
   places is, reduced to. Her silver may become dross, and her wine be
   mixed with water, the faithful city becoming a harlot; her shepherds
   may be turned into dumb, sleeping dogs, and devouring wolves; the
   watchmen may be turned smiters, her prophets to prophesy falsely, and
   her priests to bear rule by lies; the commandments of God being made
   void by the traditions of men, superstition, human inventions,
   will-worship, may defile and contaminate the service of God; yea, and
   greater abominations may men possessing Moses' chair by succession do.
   [33] Now, that the temple of God hath been thus made a den of thieves,
   that the abomination of desolation hath been set up in the holy place,
   is evident from the Jewish and Christian church; for in the one it was
   clearly so when the government of it was devolved to the scribes and
   Pharisees, and in the other when the man of sin had exalted himself in
   the midst thereof. Now, suppose a man living in the midst and height of
   such a sad apostasy, when a universal darkness had spread itself over
   the face of the church; if the Lord be pleased to reveal unto him out
   of his word some points of faith, then either not at all known or
   generally disbelieved, yet a right belief whereof is necessary to
   salvation; and, farther, out of the same word shall discover unto him
   the wickedness of that apostasy, and the means to remove it, -- I
   demand whether that man, without expecting any call from the fomenters
   and maintainers of those errors with which the church at that time is
   only not destroyed, may not preach, publish, and publicly declare the
   said truths to others (the knowledge of them being so necessary for the
   good of their souls), and conclude himself thereunto called of God, by
   virtue of the fore-named and other the like rules? Truly, for my part
   (under correction), I conceive he may, nay, he ought; neither is any
   other outward call requisite to constitute him a preacher of the gospel
   than the consent of God's people to be instructed by him. For instance:
   suppose that God should reveal the truth of the gospel to "a mere
   layman" (as they say) in Italy, so that he be fully convinced thereof,
   what shall he now do? abstain from publishing it, though he be
   persuaded in conscience that a great door of utterance might be granted
   unto him, only because some heretical, simoniacal, wicked,
   antichristian prelate hath not ordained him minister, who yet would not
   do it unless he will subscribe to those errors and heresies which he is
   persuaded to be such? Truly, I think by so abstaining he should sin
   against the law of charity, in seeing, not the ox or ass of his brother
   falling into the pit, but their precious souls sinking to everlasting
   damnation, and not preventing it when he might; and were he indeed
   truly angry with his whole nation, he might have the advantage of an
   Italian revenge.

   Moreover, he should sin against the precept of Christ, by hiding his
   light under a bushel, and napkening up his talent, an increase whereof
   will be required of him at the last day. Now, with this I was always so
   well satisfied, that I ever deemed all curious disquisition after the
   outward vocation of our first reformers, Luther, Calvin, etc.,
   altogether needless, the case in their days being exactly that which I
   have laid down.

   Come we now to the third and last way whereby men, not partakers of any
   outward ordinary vocation, may yet receive a sufficient warrant for the
   preaching and publishing of the gospel, and that by some outward act of
   Providence guiding them thereunto. For example: put case a Christian
   man should, by any chance of providence, be cast, by shipwreck, or
   otherwise upon the country of some barbarous people that never heard of
   the name of Christ, and there, by His goodness that brought him
   thither, be received amongst them into civil human society, may he not,
   nay, ought he not, to preach Christ unto them? and if God give a
   blessing to his endeavours, may he not become a pastor to the converted
   souls? None, I hope, makes any doubt of it; and in the primitive times
   nothing was more frequent than such examples. Thus were the Indians and
   the Moors turned to the faith, as you may see in Eusebius; yea, great
   was the liberty which in the first church was used in this kind,
   presently after the supernatural gift of tongues ceased amongst men.

Chapter VIII.

   Of the liberty and duty of gifted uncalled Christians in the exercise
   of divers acts of God's worship.

   And thus have I declared what I conceive concerning extraordinary
   calling to the public teaching of the word, in what cases only it useth
   to take place; whence I conclude, that whosoever pretends unto it, not
   warranted by an evidence of one of those three ways that God taketh in
   such proceedings, is but a pretender, an impostor, and ought,
   accordingly, to be rejected of all God's people. In other cases, not to
   disuse what outward ordinary occasion, from them who are intrusted by
   commission from God with that power, doth confer upon persons so
   called, we must needs grant it a negative voice in the admission of any
   to the public preaching of the gospel. If they come not in at that
   door, they do climb over the wall, if they make any entrance at all. It
   remains, then, to shut up all, that it be declared what private
   Christians, living in a pure, orthodox, well-ordered church, may do,
   and how far they may interest themselves in holy, soul-concerning
   affairs, both in respect of their own particular and of their brethren
   in the midst of whom they live; in which determination, because it
   concerneth men of low degree, and those that comparatively may be said
   to be unlearned, I shall labour to express the conceivings of my mind
   in as familiar, plain observations as I can. Only, thus much I desire
   may be premised, that the principles and rules of that church
   government from which, in the following assertions, I desire not to
   wander are of that kind (to which I do, and always, in my poor
   judgment, have adhered, since, by God's assistance, I had engaged
   myself to the study of his word) which commonly are called presbyterial
   or synodical, in opposition to prelatical or diocesan on the one side,
   and that which is commonly called independent or congregational on the
   other.

   First, then, a diligent searching of the Scriptures, with fervent
   prayers to Almighty God for the taking away that veil of ignorance
   which by nature is before their eyes, that they may come to a saving
   knowledge in and a right understanding of them, is not only lawful and
   convenient for all men professing the name of Christ, but also
   absolutely necessary; because commanded, yea indeed commanded, because
   the end so to be attained is absolutely necessary to salvation. To
   confirm this I need not multiply precepts out of the Old or New
   Testament, (such as that of Isa. viii. 20, "To the law and to the
   testimony;" and that of John v. 39, "Search the Scriptures,") which are
   innumerable; nor yet heap up motives unto it, such as are the
   description of the heavenly country whither we are going, in them
   contained, John xiv. 2; 2 Cor. v. 1; Rev. xxii. 1, etc.; the way by
   which we are to travel, laid down John v. 39, xiv. 5, 6; Jesus Christ,
   whom we must labour to be like, painted out, Gal. iii. 1; and the back
   parts of God discovered, Deut. xxix. 29. By them only true spiritual
   wisdom is conveyed to our souls, Jer. viii. 9, whereby we may become
   even wiser than our teachers, Ps. cxix. 99; in them all comfort and
   consolation is to be had in the time of danger and trouble, Ps. cxix.
   54, 71, 72; in brief, the knowledge of Christ, which is "life eternal,"
   John xvii. 3; yea, all that can be said in this kind comes infinitely
   short of those treasures of wisdom, riches, and goodness which are
   contained in them: "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the
   soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple," Ps.
   xix. 7. But this duty of the people is clear and confessed, the
   objections of the Papists against it being, for the most part, so many
   blasphemies against the holy word of God. They accuse it of difficulty,
   which God affirms to "make wise the simple;" of obscurity, which
   "openeth the eyes of the blind;" to be a dead letter, a nose of wax,
   which is "quick and powerful, piercing to the dividing asunder of the
   soul and spirit;" to be weak and insufficient, which "is able to make
   the man of God perfect" and "wise unto salvation." Yea, that word which
   the apostle affirmeth to be "profitable for reproof" is not in any
   thing more full than in reproving of this blasphemy.

   Secondly, They may not only (as before) search the Scriptures, but also
   examine and try by them the doctrine that publicly is taught unto them.
   The people of God must not be like "children, tossed to and fro, and
   carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and
   cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive," Eph. iv. 14.
   All is not presently gospel that is spoken in the pulpit; it is not
   long since that altar-worship, Arminianism, Popery, superstition, etc.,
   were freely preached in this kingdom. Now, what shall the people of God
   do in such a case? Yield to every breath, to every puff of false
   doctrine? or rather try it by the word of God, and if it be not
   agreeable thereunto, cast it out like salt that hath lost its savour?
   Must not the people take care that they be not seduced? Must they not
   "beware of false prophets, which come unto them in sheep's clothing,
   but inwardly are ravening wolves?" And how shall they do this? what way
   remains but a trying their doctrine by the rule? In these evil days
   wherein we live, I hear many daily complaining that there is such
   difference and contrariety among preachers, they know not what to do
   nor scarce what to believe. My answer is, Do but your own duty, and
   this trouble is at an end. Is there any contrariety in the book of God?
   Pin not your faith upon men's opinions; the Bible is the touchstone.
   That there is such diversity amongst teachers is their fault, who
   should think all the same thing; but that this is so troublesome to you
   is your own fault, for neglecting your duty of trying all things by the
   word. Alas! you are in a miserable condition, if you have all this
   while relied on the authority of men in heavenly things. He that builds
   his faith upon preachers, though they preach nothing but truth, and he
   pretend to believe it, hath indeed no faith at all, but a wavering
   opinion, built upon a rotten foundation. Whatever, then, is taught you,
   you must go with it "to the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
   according to this word, it is because there is no light in them," Isa.
   viii. 20. Yea, the Bereans are highly extolled for searching whether
   the doctrine concerning our Saviour preached by St Paul were so or no,
   Acts xvii. 11; agreeably to the precept of the same preacher, 1 Thess.
   v. 21, "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good;" as also to
   that of St John, 1 Epist. iv. 1, "Beloved, believe not every spirit,
   but try the spirits whether they be of God; because many false prophets
   are gone out into the world." Prophets, then, must be tried before they
   be trusted. Now, the reason of this holds still. There are many false
   teachers abroad in the world; wherefore try every one, try his spirit,
   his spiritual gift of teaching, and that by the word of God. And here
   you have a clear rule laid down how you may extricate yourselves from
   the former perplexity. Nay, St Paul himself, speaking to understanding
   Christians, requires them to judge of it: 1 Cor. x. 15, "I speak as to
   wise men; judge ye what I say." Hence are those cautions that the
   people should look that none do seduce them, Matt. xxiv. 4; to which
   end they must have their souls "exercised" in the word of God, "to
   discern both good and evil," Heb. v. 14. Thus, also, in one place
   Christ biddeth his followers hear the Pharisees, and do what they
   should command, because they sat in Moses' chair, Matt. xxiii. 2, 3;
   and yet in another place gives them a caution to beware of the doctrine
   of the Pharisees, Matt. xvi. 12. It remaineth, then, that the people
   are bound to hear those who possess the place of teaching in the
   church, but withal they must beware that it contain nothing of the old
   leaven; to which end they must try it by the word of God; when, as St
   Paul prayeth for the Philippians, "their love may abound yet more and
   more in knowledge, and all judgment, that they may approve things that
   are excellent," Phil. i. 9, 10. Unless ministers will answer for all
   those souls they shall mislead, and excuse them before God at the day
   of trial, they ought not to debar them from trying their doctrine. Now
   this they cannot do; for "if the blind lead the blind, both fall into
   the pit" of destruction. And here I might have just occasion of
   complaint:-- 1. Of the superstitious pride of the late clergy of this
   land, who could not endure to have their doctrine tried by their
   auditors, crying to poor men, with the Pharisees, John ix. 34, "Ye were
   altogether born in sins, and do ye teach us?' A pretty world it is like
   to be, when the sheep will needs teach their pastors!" Nothing would
   serve them but a blind submission to the loose dictates of their cobweb
   homilies. He saw farther, sure, in the darkness of Popery, who
   contended that a whole general council ought to give place to a simple
   layman urging Scripture or speaking reason. Now, surely this is very
   far from that gentleness, meekness, and aptness to teach, which St Paul
   requireth in a man of God, a minister of the gospel. 2. The negligence
   of the people, also, might here come under a just reproof, who have not
   laboured to discern the voice of the hireling from that of the true
   shepherd, but have promiscuously followed the new-fangledness and
   heretical errors of every time-serving starver of souls. Whence
   proceedeth all that misery the land now groaneth under, but that we
   have had a people willing to be led by a corrupted clergy, freely
   drinking in the poison wherewith they are tainted? "The prophets
   prophesied falsely, the priests bare rule by their means, the people
   loved to have it so; but what shall we now do in the end thereof?" Who
   could ever have thought that the people of England would have yielded a
   willing ear to so many popish errors, and an obedient shoulder to such
   a heavy burden of superstitions, as in a few years were instilled into
   them, and laid upon them voluntarily, by their own sinful neglect,
   ensnaring their consciences by the omission of this duty we insist
   upon, of examining by the word what is taught unto them? [34] But this
   is no place for complaints. And this is a second thing which the
   people, distinct from their pastors, may do for their own edification.
   Now, whether they do this privately, every one apart, or by assembling
   more together, is altogether indifferent. And that this was observed by
   private Christians in the primitive times is very apparent.

   Come we, in the third place, to what either their duty binds them to,
   or otherwise by the word they are allowed to do, in sacred performances
   having reference to others. Look, then, in general upon those things we
   find them tied unto by virtue of special precept, such as are, to warn
   the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, 1 Thess. v.
   14; to admonish and reprove offending brethren, Matt. xviii. 15; to
   instruct the ignorant, John iv. 29, Acts xviii. 26; to exhort the
   negligent, Heb. iii. 13, x. 24, 25; to comfort the afflicted, 1 Thess.
   v. 11; to restore him that falleth, Gal. vi. 1; to visit the sick,
   Matt. xxv. 36, 40; to reconcile those that are at variance, Matt. v. 9;
   to contend for the faith, Jude 3, 1 Pet. iii. 15; to pray for the
   sinner not unto death,1 John v. 16; to edify one another in their most
   holy faith, Jude 20; to speak to themselves in psalms, and hymns, and
   spiritual songs, Eph. v. 19; to be ready to answer every man in giving
   account of their faith, Col. iv. 6; to mark them that make divisions,
   Rom. xvi. 17; with innumerable others to the like purpose. It remaineth
   for them to consider, secondly, in particular, what course they may
   take, beyond private conference between man and man, by indiction of
   time or place for the fulfilling of what, by these precepts and the
   like, is of them required. To which I answer, --

   First, lawful things must be done lawfully. If any unlawful
   circumstance attend the performance of a lawful action, it vitiates the
   whole work; for "bonum oritur ex integris." For instance, to reprove an
   offender is a Christian duty, but for a private man to do it in the
   public congregation whilst the minister is preaching, were, instead of
   a good act, a foul crime, being a notorious disturbance of church
   decency and order.

   Secondly, That for a public, formal, ministerial teaching, two things
   are required in the teacher:-- first, Gifts from God; secondly,
   Authority from the church (I speak now of ordinary cases). He that
   wants either is no true pastor. For the first, God sends none upon an
   employment but whom he fits with gifts for it, 1. Not one command in
   the Scripture made to teachers; 2. Not one rule for their direction; 3.
   Not one promise to their endeavours; 4. Not any end of their
   employment; 5. Not one encouragement to their duty; 6. Not one reproof
   for their negligence; 7. Not the least intimation of their reward, --
   but cuts off ungifted, idle pastors from any true interest in the
   calling. And for the others, that want authority from the church,
   neither ought they to undertake any formal act properly belonging to
   the ministry, such as is solemn teaching of the word; for, -- 1. They
   are none of Christ's officers, Eph. iv. 11. 2. They are expressly
   forbidden it, Jer. xxiii. 21; Heb. v. 4. 3. The blessing on the word is
   promised only to sent teachers, Rom. x. 14, 15. 4. If to be gifted be
   to be called, then, -- (1.) Every one might undertake so much in sacred
   duties as he fancies himself to be able to perform; (2.) Children (as
   they report of Athanasius [35] ) might baptize; (3.) Every common
   Christian might administer the communion. But endless are the arguments
   that might be multiplied against this fancy. In a word, if our Saviour
   Christ be the God of order, he hath left his church to no such
   confusion.

   Thirdly, That to appoint time and place for the doing of that which God
   hath appointed indefinitely to be done in time and place, rather
   commends than vitiates the duty. So did Job's friends in the duty of
   comforting the afflicted; they made an appointment together to come and
   comfort him, Job ii. 11; and so did they, Zech. viii. 21; and so did
   David, Ps. cxix. 62.

   Fourthly, There is much difference between opening or interpreting the
   word, and applying the word upon the advantage of such an approved
   interpretation; as also between an authoritative act, or doing a thing
   by virtue of special office, and a charitable act, or doing a thing out
   of a motion of Christian love.

   Fifthly, It may be observed concerning gifts, --

   1. That the gifts and graces of God's Spirit are of two sorts, some
   being bestowed for the sanctification of God's people, some for the
   edification of his church; some of a private allay, looking primarily
   inwards to the saving of his soul on whom they are bestowed (though in
   their fruits also they have a relation and habitude to others), other
   some aiming at the commonwealth or profit of the whole church as such.
   Of the first sort are those mentioned Gal. v. 22, 23, "The fruit of the
   Spirit is love, joy, peace," etc., with all other graces that are
   necessary to make the man of God perfect in all holiness and the fear
   of the Lord; the other are those charismata pneumatika, spiritual gifts
   of teaching, praying, prophesying, mentioned 1 Cor. xiv., and in other
   places.

   2. That all these gifts, coming down from the Father of lights, are
   given by the same Spirit, "dividing to every man severally as he will,"
   1 Cor. xii. 11. He is not tied, in the bestowing of his gifts, to any
   sort, estate, calling, or condition of men; but worketh them freely, as
   it pleaseth him, in whom he will. The Spirit them mentioned is that God
   which "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will," Eph. i.
   11; they are neither deserved by our goodness nor obtained by our
   endeavours.

   3. That the end why God bestoweth these gifts on any is merely that,
   within the bounds of their own calling (in which they are
   circumscribed, 1 Cor. i. 26), they should use them to his glory and the
   edification of his church; for "the manifestation of the Spirit is
   given to every man to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7. Christ gives none
   of his talents to be bound up in napkins, but expects his own with
   increase. [36]

   And from these considerations it is easily discernible both what the
   people of God, distinct from their pastors, in a well-ordered church,
   may do in this kind whereof we treat, and how. In general, then, I
   assert, --

   That, for the improving of knowledge, the increasing of Christian
   charity, for the furtherance of a strict and holy communion of that
   spiritual love and amity which ought to be amongst the brethren, they
   may of their own accord assemble together, to consider one another, to
   provoke unto love and good works, to stir up the gifts that are in
   them, yielding and receiving mutual consolation by the fruits of their
   most holy faith.

   Now, because there be many Uzzahs amongst us, who have an itching
   desire to be fingering of the ark, thinking more highly of themselves
   than they ought to think, and, like the ambitious sons of Levi, taking
   too much upon them, it will not be amiss to give two cautions, deducted
   from the former rules:--

   First, That they do not, under a pretence of Christian liberty and
   freedom of conscience, cast away all brotherly amity, and cut
   themselves off from the communion of the church. Christ hath not
   purchased a liberty for any to rend his body. They will prove at length
   to be no duties of piety which break the sacred bonds of charity.

   Men ought not, under a pretence of congregating themselves to serve
   their God, separate from their brethren, neglecting the public
   assemblies; as was the manner of some rebuked by the apostle, Heb. x.
   25. There be peculiar blessings and transcendant privileges annexed to
   public assemblies, which accompany not private men to their recesses.
   The sharp-edged sword becomes more keen when set on by a skillful
   master of the assemblies; and when the water of the word flows there,
   the Spirit of God moves upon the face thereof, to make it effectual in
   our hearts. "What! despise ye the church of God?" 1 Cor. xi. 22.

   Secondly, As the ministry, so also ought the ministers to have that
   regard, respect, and obedience, which is due to their labours in that
   sacred calling. Would we could not too frequently see more puffed up
   with the conceit of their own gifts, into a contempt of the most
   learned and pious pastors! -- these are "spots in your feasts of
   charity, clouds without water, carried about of winds." It must,
   doubtless, be an evil root that bringeth forth such bitter fruit.
   Wherefore, let not our brethren fall into this condemnation, lest there
   be an evil report raised by them that are without; but "remember them
   which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of
   God," Heb. xiii. 7. There is no greater evidence of the heavenly
   improvement you make by your recesses than that you obey them that are
   guides unto you, and submit yourselves: for "they watch for your souls,
   as they that must give an account, that they may do it with joy, and
   not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you," verse 17. Let not
   them who despise a faithful, painful minister in public, flatter
   themselves with hope of a blessing on their endeavours in private. Let
   them pretend what they will, they have not an equal respect unto all
   God's ordinances. Wherefore, that the coming together in this sort may
   be for the better, and not for the worse, observe these things:--

   Now, for what gifts (that are, as before, freely bestowed) whose
   exercise is permitted unto such men so assembled; I mean in a private
   family, or two or three met homothumadon, in one.

   And first we may name the gift of prayer, whose exercise must not be
   exempted from such assemblies, if any be granted. These are the times
   wherein the Spirit of grace and of supplications is promised to be
   poured out upon the Jerusalem of God, Zech. xii. 10. Now, God having
   bestowed the gift and requiring the duty, his people ought not to be
   hindered in the performance of it. Are all those precepts to pray, in
   the Scriptures, only for our closets? When the church was in distress
   for the imprisonment of Peter, there was a meeting at the house of
   Mary, the mother of John, Acts xii. 12. "Many were gathered together
   praying," saith the text; -- a sufficient warrant for the people of God
   in like cases. The churches are in no less distress now than at that
   time; and in some congregations the ministers are so oppressed that
   publicly they dare not, in others so corrupted that they will not, pray
   for the prosperity of Jerusalem. Now, truly, it were a disconsolate
   thing for any one of God's servants to say, "During all these straits,
   I never joined with any of God's children in the pouring out of my
   prayer in the behalf of his church:" neither can I see how this can
   possibly be prevented but by the former means; to which add the counsel
   of St Paul, "Speaking to themselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
   songs, singing and making melody in their hearts unto the Lord," Eph.
   v. 19.

   Secondly, They may exercise the gifts of wisdom, knowledge, and
   understanding in the ways of the Lord; comforting, strengthening, and
   encouraging each other with the same consolations and promises which,
   by the benefit of the public ministry, they have received from the
   word. Thus, in time of distress, the prophet Malachi tells us that
   "they that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord
   hearkened, and heard," etc., chap. iii. 16; -- comforting, as it
   appears, one another in the promises of God made unto his church,
   against the flourishing of the wicked and overflowing of ungodliness,
   the persecution of tyrants and impurity of transgressors.

   Thirdly, They may make use of "the tongue of the learned" (if given
   unto them) to "speak a word in season to him that is weary," Isa. l. 4;
   for being commanded to "confess their faults one to another," James v.
   16, they have power also to apply to them that are penitent the
   promises of mercy. We should never be commanded to open our wounds to
   them who have no balm to pour into them; he shall have cold comfort who
   seeks for counsel from a dumb man. So that in this, and the like cases,
   they may apply unto and instruct one another in the word of God; doing
   it as a charitable duty, and not as out of necessary function, even as
   Aquila and Priscilla expounded unto Apollos the word of God more
   perfectly than he knew it before, Acts xviii. 24-26. In sum, and not to
   enlarge this discourse with any more particulars, the people of God are
   allowed all quiet and peaceable means, whereby they may help each other
   forward in the knowledge of godliness and the way towards heaven.

   Now, for the close of this discourse, I will remove some objections
   that I have heard godly men, and men not unlearned, lay against it, out
   of a zeal (not unlike that of Joshua for Moses' sake) [for] the
   constitute pastor's sake; to whom, though I might briefly answer, with
   Moses, "Would God all the Lord's people were prophets!' -- I heartily
   wish that every one of them had such a plentiful measure of spiritual
   endowments that they might become wise unto salvation, above many of
   their teachers;" in which vote I make no doubt but every one will
   concur with me who has the least experimental knowledge what a burden
   upon the shoulders, what a grief unto the soul of a minister knowing
   and desiring to discharge his duty, is an ignorant congregation (of
   which, thanks to our prelates, pluralists, non-residents, homilies,
   service-book, and ceremonies, we have too many in this kingdom; the
   many, also, of our ministers in this church taking for their directory
   the laws and penalties of men, informing what they should not do if
   they would avoid their punishment, and not the precepts of God, what
   they should as their duty do if they meant to please him, and knowing
   there was no statute whereon they might be sued for (pardon the
   expression) the dilapidation of souls: so their own houses were ceiled,
   they cared not at all though the church of God lay waste); -- I say,
   though I might thus answer, with opening my desire for the increasing
   of knowledge among the people, of which I take this to be an effectual
   means, yet I will give brief answers to the several objections:--

   Objection 1. "Then this seems to favour all allowance of licentious
   conventicles, which in all places the laws have condemned, and learned
   men in all ages have abhorred, as the seminaries of faction and schism
   in the church of God."

   Ans. That (under correction) I conceive the law layeth hold of none, as
   peccant in such a kind, but only those who have pre-declared themselves
   to be opposers of the worship of God in the public assemblies of that
   church wherein they live. Now, the patronage of any such I before
   rejected. Neither do I conceive that they ought at all to be allowed
   the benefit of private meetings who wilfully abstain from the public
   congregations, so long as the true worship of God is held forth in
   them. Yea, how averse I have ever been from that kind of confused
   licentiousness in any church, I have some while since declared, in an
   answer (drawn up for my own and private friends' satisfaction) to the
   arguments of the Remonstrants in their Apology, and replies to
   Vedelius, with other treatises, for such a "liberty of prophesying," as
   they term it, If, then, the law account only such assemblies to be
   conventicles wherein the assemblers contemn and despise the service of
   God in public, I have not spoken one word in favour of them. And for
   that canon which was mounted against them, whether intentionally, in
   the first institution of it, it was moulded and framed against
   Anabaptists or no, I cannot tell; but this I am sure, that in the
   discharge of it, it did execution oftentimes upon such as had Christ's
   precept and promise to warrant their assembling, Matt. xviii. 19, 20.
   Not to contend about words, would to God that which is good might not
   be persecuted under odious appellations, and called evil when it is
   otherwise; so to expose it to the tyrannical oppression of the enemies
   of the gospel! The thing itself, rightly understood, can scarce be
   condemned of any who envies not the salvation of souls. They that would
   banish the gospel from our houses would not much care if it were gone
   from our hearts; from our houses, I say, for it is all one whether
   these duties be performed in one family or a collection of more. Some
   one is bigger than ten others; shall their assembling to perform what
   is lawful for that one be condemned for a conventicle? Where is the law
   for that? or what is there in all this more than God required of his
   ancient people, as I showed before? Or must a master of a family cease
   praying in his family, and instructing his children and servants in the
   ways of the Lord, for fear of being counted a preacher in a tub? Things
   were scarcely carried with an equal hand for the kingdom of Christ,
   when orders came forth on the one side to give liberty to the profane
   multitude to assemble themselves at heathenish sports, with bestial
   exclamations, on the Lord's own day; and on the other, to punish them
   who durst gather themselves together for prayer or the singing of
   psalms But I hope, through God's blessing, we shall be for ever quit of
   all such ecclesiastical discipline as must be exercised according to
   the interest of idle drones, whom it concerneth to see that there be
   none to try or examine their doctrine, or of superstitious innovators,
   who desire to obtrude their fancies upon the unwary people. Whence
   comes it that we have such an innumerable multitude of ignorant, stupid
   souls, unacquainted with the very principles of religion, but from the
   discountenancing of these means of increasing knowledge by men who
   would not labour to do it themselves? O that we could see the many
   swearers, and drunkards, and Sabbath-breakers, etc., in this nation,
   guilty only of this crime! Would the kingdom were so happy, the church
   so holy!

   Obj. 2. "Men are apt to pride themselves in their gifts, and flatter
   themselves in their performances, so that let them approach as nigh as
   the tabernacle, and you shall quickly have them encroaching upon the
   priest's office also, and, by an overweening of their own endeavours,
   create themselves pastors in separate congregations.

   Ans. It cannot be but offences will come, so long as there is malice in
   Satan and corruption in men. There is no doubt but there is danger of
   some such thing; but hereof the liberty mentioned is not the cause, but
   an accidental occasion only, no way blamable. Gifts must not be
   condemned because they may be abused. God-fearing men will remember
   Korah, knowing, as one says well, that "Uzzah had better ventured the
   falling than the fingering of the ark." They that truly love their
   souls will not suffer themselves to be carried away by false conceit,
   so far as to help to overthrow the very constitution of any church by
   confusion, or the flourishing of it by ignorance; both which would
   certainly follow such courses. Knowledge if alone puffeth up, but
   joined to charity it edifieth.

   Obj. 3. "But may not this be a means for men to vent and broach their
   own private fancies unto others? to foment and cherish errors in one
   another? to give false interpretations of the word, there being no way
   to prevent it?"

   Ans. For interpreting of the word I speak not, but applying of it,
   being rightly interpreted. And for the rest, would to God the
   complaints were not true of those things that have for divers years in
   this church been done publicly and outwardly according to order! But,
   that no inconvenience arise from hence, the care rests on them to whom
   the dispensation of the word is committed, whose sedulous endeavour to
   reprove and convince all unsound doctrine, not agreeing to the form of
   wholesome words, is the sovereign and only remedy to cure, or means to
   prevent, this evil. For the close of all, we may observe that those who
   are most offended and afraid lest others should encroach upon their
   callings are, for the most part, such as have almost deserted it
   themselves, neglecting their own employment, when they are the busiest
   of mortals in things of this world. To conclude, then, for what I have
   delivered in this particular, I conceive that I have the judgment and
   practice of the whole church of Scotland, agreeable to the word of God,
   for my warrant. Witness the act of their assembly at Edinburgh, anno
   1641, wherewith the learned Rutherford concludes his defence of their
   discipline, with whose words I will shut up this discourse: "Our
   assembly, also, commandeth godly conference at all occasional meetings,
   or as God's providence shall dispose, as the word of God commandeth,
   providing none invade the pastor's office, to preach the word, who are
   not called thereunto by God and his church."
