   A History Of The

   Methodist Episcopal Church

By Nathan Bangs, D.D.

   Volume III, Published in 1841 (From The Year 1816 To The Year 1828)

NOTICE TO THE READER

   The favorable manner in which the first and second volumes of this
   History have been received, induces me to add a third, in the hope that
   it may increase the stock of useful information in reference to the
   work which God has wrought in this country by the instrumentality of
   the Methodist Episcopal Church.

   In the conclusion of the second volume it was remarked, that it was my
   intention, when the History was commenced, to bring it down near to the
   present time, in two volumes; but, as I proceeded in the work, it was
   found impracticable to fulfill this intention, without such an
   abridgment as would either compel me to omit some important
   transactions and edifying incidents, or so to shorten them as to render
   them uninstructive and uninteresting. I was therefore compelled,
   contrary to my first design, to close the second volume in the year
   1816.

   That this alteration in the plan at first contemplated has been
   generally approved of, I have evidence from numerous testimonies.
   Indeed, the greatest fault I have heard, from those who are disposed to
   judge charitably of my work, has been, that it is not sufficiently
   particular, or that its details are not as numerous as is desired. This
   defect, however, if it be one, I am unable to remedy, as I have, with
   but few exceptions, wrought up all the materials within my reach,
   unless I were injudiciously to encumber the volume with irrelevant
   matter.

   The present volume, however, I consider rich in matter, particularly in
   relation to the doings of the General Conference, and to the
   enlargement of our work by means of our Missionary Society, and other
   auxiliary appliances. And I have endeavored to give such a detailed
   account of the origin, character, and progress of this society as will,
   if the history be continued on the same plan, supersede the necessity
   of a separate history of that institution. Indeed, this society,
   together with the tract, Sunday school, and education causes, is so
   interwoven in our general plan of operations, that a history of our
   Church would be quite imperfect which did not embrace a narrative of
   these things.

   It being desirable to have the alphabetical list of preachers unbroken,
   it has been thought advisable to transfer that list from the third to
   the fourth volume; and the more so as that volume is sufficiently large
   without it, containing, as it does, upward of four hundred pages.

   In adverting to this list I consider it proper to mention the following
   facts, as furnishing good reasons for an apology for any errors which
   have been or may be detected, in the spelling of names, dates, or
   otherwise.
    1. In regard to the orthography [ spelling -- DVM] of proper names I
       have, found insuperable difficulties. The same name I have in
       frequent instances found differently spelled in the printed Minutes
       even for the same year -- one way perhaps when admitted on trial,
       and another in the stations -- and then the next year differently
       from either of the two. In this confusion who is to decide which is
       right. It is true that some names, particularly those found in the
       sacred Scriptures, though these are by no means uniformly alike in
       their orthography in the Old and New Testaments, owing to the
       different usages of the Hebrew and Greek languages -- and in the
       Greek and Latin classics, have a fixed orthography; but in most
       instances proper names are spelled as whim or fancy would dictate,
       some families, even of their own accord, either dropping or adding
       a letter or letters. And this confusion and difficulty exist in a
       peculiar degree in the United States, made up, as the citizens are,
       from almost every nation under heaven, and therefore having names,
       the orthography of which is peculiar to the several nations from
       which they came, or to the ancestors from whom they have descended.
       If any one can unravel this tangled skein, and teach us how to
       spell every proper name correctly, he will perform a task for which
       I confess myself inadequate. Or if any one will take the Minutes of
       our conferences and decide which of the varying orthographies of
       some names is the correct one, he shall receive my thanks, and will
       merit the thanks of all concerned. But as the secretaries of the
       annual conferences, editors, and printers were not able to control
       this perplexing business at the times the Minutes were prepared and
       printed, I hope to be pardoned if I should fail to make every thing
       of this sort entirely accurate.
    2. But this is by no means the most serious difficulty which I have
       had to encounter. In several instances I have found preachers
       returned located, and in three instances expelled, [1] who were
       never admitted into full connection. Such names I have generally
       omitted altogether, as I have taken no account of mere probationers
       in the traveling ministry.
    3. In numerous instances I have found that certain preachers were
       located, readmitted, and then located again, twice, thrice, and
       even four times. In such cases I have, as far as I could ascertain
       the fact, fixed the date of their location the last time mentioned,
       with a view to give them credit for at least all the years they may
       have traveled. On this account, those who may compare the list in
       this volume -- which has been thoroughly revised -- with the one
       appended to the second, will find that several who were recorded as
       located before, or in the year 1816, are herein returned as having
       located at a later date, because they re-entered the traveling
       ministry, continued for a shorter or longer time, and then located
       again.
    4. In a few instances persons have been expelled by an annual
       conference, and afterward, on an appeal, restored by the General
       Conference. This may have led to some errors in these returns,
       though I trust but few.
    5. In some instances preachers were continued on trial for more than
       two years and not adverting to that fact while preparing the list
       for the former volume, and taking their names as they stand
       recorded in answer to the question, "Who are admitted into full
       connection?" such were returned as received a year later than was
       actually the case. So far as this fact has been ascertained, the
       correction has been made in the present list.
    6. In many cases it has been difficult to ascertain the precise year
       in which a preacher died. In the body of the History I have, in
       recording deaths, generally followed the order of the Minutes, and
       recorded them as having died in the course of the preceding year;
       but in the alphabetical list I have endeavored to ascertain the
       year in which each preacher died. As, however, some of the records
       are indefinite in this particular, I have been guided by the most
       probable conjecture. There are, however, I believe, but few cases
       of this character.

   When the reader duly considers these perplexing discrepancies and
   defects, he will be prepared to make some allowance for the unavoidable
   errors which grow out of them; and the more so, when he considers that
   this History has been written by a hand equally fallible as those which
   prepared the authorized records.

   Some unintentional omissions of names in the former volume are supplied
   in this; and if others should be detected, as doubtless they will be,
   the correction will be made with the more pleasure, because it will add
   to the perfection of the work. The reader may rest assured, however,
   that no pains have been spared by either the author or printer to make
   every thing as accurate as possible; and hence, if errors are detected,
   he must attribute them to a want of ability, under the circumstances,
   to avoid them.

   To God, -- who alone is absolutely perfect, but whose boundless mercy
   inclines him to pardon the aberrations of his creatures, for the sake
   of his Son Jesus Christ, be ascribed the honor and glory for what he
   has done for this branch of his Church.

CHAPTER 3

    From the Death of Bishop Asbury to the Close of the General Conference of
    1816

   In the closing part of the last volume an incidental allusion was made
   to a controversy which arose in this country between us and other
   denominations, but more particularly the Calvinists.

   It is well known that not long after Mr. Wesley began his career of
   usefulness, he was joined by Mr. Whitefield, whose stirring eloquence
   in the pulpits of the Establishment created a great sensation among
   both clergy and people, and drew such multitudes to hear him, that he
   ventured, in imitation of his Divine Master, into the fields, where he
   proclaimed the glad tidings of salvation to listening thousands. Wesley
   soon followed the example, and great was the effect produced by their
   joint exertions in this novel way of preaching Christ and him
   crucified.

   Unhappily, to human appearance, a difference arose between these two
   great and good men. Whitefield, being much opposed and persecuted by
   the lukewarm clergy of the Establishment, gradually contracted an
   intimacy with the Dissenters, and, on his coming to America, became
   acquainted with the pious and talented Edwards -- afterward president
   of Princeton College -- then settled at Northampton, Massachusetts.
   Finding among these people more of the appearance of evangelical
   doctrine, and of experimental and practical piety, than with those of
   the Establishment, Whitefield soon drank in their doctrine of
   predestination and its correlatives, eternal election and final
   perseverance. This led to a controversy between him and Wesley, which
   eventuated in a partial separation -- a separation in their respective
   fields of labor and sentiment, though not in heart and affection -- for
   they always esteemed each other highly as devoted Christian ministers.
   This took place in the year 1741, Whitefield rallying under the banner
   of Calvinistic decrees, patronized by Lady Huntingdon, and supported by
   many of what were called the evangelical clergy of the Establishment in
   England, and by the most zealous of the Presbyterians and
   Congregationalists of America -- while Wesley and his brother Charles
   hoisted the flag of Arminius, fortifying themselves with the standards
   of their own church, and defending themselves by direct appeals to the
   Holy Scriptures and the dictates of common sense and sound reason. This
   brought on a protracted warfare between the parties, both from the
   pulpit and the press, during which the doctrines and measures of Mr.
   Wesley passed through the severest ordeal of critical investigation,
   and most heart-searching appeals to Scripture and reason.

   This brought the vicar of Madeley, the pious and peace-loving Fletcher,
   from his retreat in the obscure parish where he had chosen to labor for
   the salvation of souls, and obliged him, quite contrary to his pacific
   disposition, to buckle on the armor of a polemic, in which he acquitted
   himself with singular success. He, indeed, seemed to be providentially
   raised up for the crisis, and he entered the arena of controversy fully
   furnished by sound and various learning, by deep and genuine piety, by
   meekness, patience, and love, and by a power of comprehension and nice
   discrimination, which peculiarly fitted him to sustain with dignity,
   firmness, and success, the high and holy cause he was called to defend.
   It is not saying too much to affirm, that he vanquished all his
   antagonists, cleared the field of controversy of the thorns and briers
   of error, and at the same time maintained the spirit and temper of the
   Christian, while he powerfully wielded the sword of truth, and brought
   the warfare to a successful issue, sustaining through the entire
   conflict the character of an able divine, a sound moralist, a
   consistent minister of Jesus Christ, and an acute and conclusive
   reasoner.

   Though assailed often by bitter railing and biting sarcasm, he
   maintained the gravity of the minister of Christ and the meekness of
   the consistent Christian. If at any time he turned the weapon of irony
   upon his antagonists -- as he sometimes did with most powerful effect
   -- it was divested of the venom of bitterness, and dipped in the sweet
   waters of brotherly love. His masterly defenses of Wesleyan theology
   remain unanswered, and, it is believed, unanswerable, and will long
   remain as a monument of his piety, of his devotion to the cause of
   truth, as well as a lofty beacon to apprise future mariners who may
   embark upon the rough sea of controversy, of the dangerous shoals and
   rocks upon which so many heedless men have been wrecked -- at the same
   time distinctly and accurately marking the channel of truth through
   which the spiritual ark may be safely guided to the harbor of eternal
   repose.

   Armed with the panoply thus furnished them, the Wesleyan missionaries
   who first visited our shores were prepared to promulgate and defend the
   doctrines and to enforce the discipline of their founder. As before
   said, however, they mainly insisted on experimental and practical
   godliness, urging upon all, high and low, rich and poor, the necessity
   of a change of heart, -- such a change as should be productive of a
   reformation of life and conduct, in order to insure everlasting
   salvation. Instead of exhausting their strength in controversial
   preaching on those debatable points about which they differed from
   Calvinists, Unitarians, Arians, and Universalists, they generally
   contented themselves with a plain and unvarnished statement of their
   doctrinal views, with urging upon the people experimental and practical
   religion, and with defending themselves when assailed by others. This
   defense, however, often became necessary, more especially in the
   northern and eastern states, where the people were more accustomed to a
   critical examination of doctrinal points, and questions of doubtful
   disputation.

   For some time, however, the number of Methodists in this country was so
   inconsiderable, that other denominations affected to treat them with
   silent contempt; and if occasionally they condescended to notice them
   at all, it was more in the way of caricature and misrepresentation than
   by sober argument, or an attempt at a fair and direct refutation of
   their doctrine and usages. The High Churchman would sneer at our
   ordination, and, wrapping himself in the cloak of apostolical
   succession, with an air of assumed dignity, prate about "John Wesley's
   lay bishops," as though these jokes were sufficient to put us out of
   countenance. Others, panoplied in the stern decrees of Calvin, and
   priding themselves in their exclusive orthodoxy, would tantalize us
   with "salvation by the merit of good works, the omnipotency of
   free-will, and the unsoundness of our doctrine of justification;" while
   some would smile at "baby baptism," as an affront offered to the Deity,
   and an innovation upon apostolic usage. These all united to ridicule
   our itinerant plan of preaching the gospel, as a novelty which must
   soon come to an end; and, to give point and poignancy to their
   sarcasms, our itinerant preachers were called "circuit-riders," as if
   to ride a circuit were their distinguishing badge, not caring to inform
   the people whether as preachers or itinerant physicians.

   These reproaches were borne with as much patience as possible, and our
   ministers continued to deserve them more and more by persevering in
   their peculiar work, and by endeavoring to prove their falsity by a
   faithful exhibition of the true doctrines of their church, and also to
   refute the slanderous representations of their mode of life and manner
   of preaching, by the exemplariness of their conduct. To those who
   became intimately acquainted with them from personal intercourse, they
   commended themselves for the depth and uniformity of their piety, as
   well as by the soundness of their doctrine and the laboriousness of
   their lives. In all such a confidence was inspired in the strictness of
   their integrity, as well as in the wisdom of their plans of doing good
   to the souls and bodies of men.

   But, as before said, these controversies and modes of defense were
   confined chiefly to the pulpit, and to a republication of a few of
   Wesley's and Fletcher's doctrinal and practical tracts and sermons, the
   reading of which was confined mostly to our own societies and their
   immediate friends.; we had no writers of note on this side the
   Atlantic, and no periodical through which we could speak to the public
   ear; for, as I have before remarked, after the discontinuance of the
   Arminian Magazine, in 1790 -- two volumes only having been published --
   with the exception of a few straggling pamphlets, which scarcely
   survived the day of their birth, our press was as silent as the grave
   in respect to uttering a sentiment from an American author, and the
   Magazine was not resumed until the year 1818, and even then, as its
   respected editor announced, with much fear and trembling for its
   success.

   Yet, as the Methodists increased in number and respectability, and
   their influence upon the public mind was proportionately augmented,
   other denominations began to awake from their slumber, to look about
   them for other means than those heretofore used for offensive warfare,
   as well as to defend themselves against the inroads which Methodism was
   making upon their congregations, and the impression it produced upon
   the public mind. For these "circuit-riders" were no idle shepherds.
   They not only rode circuits, but they "went everywhere preaching the
   kingdom of God," breaking over parish lines, entering into every open
   door, and with a loud, distinct voice, proclaiming to all they could
   prevail on to hear them, that they must "fear God and give glory to his
   name." Hence the opposition to our distinctive doctrines and modes of
   procedure became more serious and systematical; our opponents began to
   feel the necessity of meeting us in the field of argument with more
   fairness; and instead of drawing ridiculous caricatures for the
   amusement of themselves and their readers, to state our doctrines as we
   hold them. This, we say, became necessary, for the eyes of the public
   were becoming somewhat enlightened in respect to what Wesleyan
   Methodists really believed and taught, and were thence led to hear, and
   read, and compare for themselves. The consequence was, that the
   offensive features of Calvinism were becoming more and more repulsive,
   and the creed by which its nominal followers were distinguished
   underwent some modifications, better suited, as was thought, to the
   temper of the times. Thus, instead of ascribing the final destinies of
   mankind to an omnipotent decree, the subtle distinction was introduced
   between the natural and moral abilities of men, making the latter the
   only potent barrier to the sinner's salvation. This theory, which for
   some time was confined to comparatively few, seems to have been an
   improvement upon President Edwards's system "On the Will," and was
   invented by Dr. Hopkins, of Newport, R. I., and thenceforth called, by
   way of distinction, Hopkinsianism. This, it was thought by many, would
   enable them to meet and obviate the objections which were brought
   against the doctrine of unconditional election and reprobation, by
   placing the criminality of all sinful actions in the perversity of the
   human will, called "moral inability," especially as they contended that
   the sinner possessed a "natural ability" to do all which God required.
   Hence the doctrine of eternal decrees, as taught by John Calvin, though
   still held in theory, was studiously kept out of sight by those who
   embraced these new views, and the theory of "natural ability and moral
   inability" was substituted in its place.

   This subtle theory, however, by no means answered the proposed end. The
   Methodists still insisted that this "natural ability," however potent,
   could never overcome the efficient operation of an immutable decree,
   which had fixed the destinies of all mankind before the worlds were
   made -- nor would the moral ability or inability alter that which had
   been made unalterable by the eternal fiat [determination -- DVM] of the
   Almighty.

   These conflicting theories somewhat changed the points of controversy
   between the Calvinists and Arminians. While Wesley and Fletcher were
   compelled, from their position, to meet their antagonists on the old
   points of controversy which had been mooted in the Protestant world
   from the days of John Calvin, his system had now assumed, under the
   improving hands of some of his most distinguished followers, so many
   new traits, that new arguments of defense were called for by the
   advocates of universal atonement and conditional salvation. Under these
   circumstances, many, on both sides of these controverted points,
   thought it their duty to enter the field of theological discussion.
   This they did with all the ardor of new recruits. And among those who
   distinguished themselves in conducting this theological warfare, might
   be mentioned men who had grown gray in the cause of Christ, as well as
   others of younger years, whose youthful temperament may have betrayed
   them into a harshness of expression, on some occasions, incompatible
   with the meekness and soberness of the Christian minister -- faults of
   human beings, for which the Christian system alone provides an adequate
   atonement and mode of forgiveness.

   At length circumstances led the author of this History into a public
   debate with a Presbyterian minister, which was held in the town of
   Durham, N.Y., May 10, 1810. The discussion involved the "Five Points,"
   so long mooted by Calvinists and Arminians, and some of the other
   subjects of dispute already indicated. Not long after, the pastor of
   the congregation in whose church the debate was conducted, the Rev.
   Ralph Williston, published a volume of sermons, in which he entered
   into a discussion of the topics which had been the subjects of
   controversy in the public debate, and concluded the whole with an
   examination into the character of "Satan's ministers," in which it was
   broadly insinuated that our ministers, on several accounts, might be
   classed under that denomination. As it was thought by many that these
   sermons gave a distorted view of some of our doctrines, and must exert
   an injurious influence upon our ministry, a reply was published in
   1815, in six letters addressed to the author of the sermons, in which
   an attempt was made to rectify his mistakes, to refute his arguments in
   favor of the Calvinistic and Hopkinsian theory, and to vindicate the
   doctrines and ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Some portions
   of these letters were severely animadverted upon by the Rev. Mr.
   Haskil, of Vermont, to which an answer was published in a small book,
   called "Predestination Examined." Soon after, Mr. Williston sent out a
   second volume, in reply to the "Errors of Hopkinsianism," the title of
   the book containing the letters addressed to that gentleman, called "A
   Vindication of some of the essential Doctrines of the Reformation."
   This attempt to identify the peculiarities of Hopkinsianism with the
   essential doctrines of the reformers, called forth "The Reformer
   Reformed," the title being suggested by the impression, that if the
   Reformation carried with it errors of such a pernicious consequence, as
   it was believed must flow from the doctrine of an efficient operation
   of universal and immutable decrees, the Reformation itself needed
   reforming -- a sentiment not retracted on more mature consideration.

   It by no means becomes me to express an opinion of the character or
   results of this protracted discussion, though I may be allowed to
   indulge a hope that it had its use in bringing our doctrines more
   prominently before the public, in rectifying some erroneous impressions
   respecting our ministry and usages, and in awakening public attention
   to the precise points of difference between us and our Calvinistic
   brethren. The subject, however, has been thus introduced here, because
   these things belong properly to the history of the times, and also to
   show the position we occupied in the ecclesiastical affairs of the
   country, as well as the duties which seemed to devolve on us to defend,
   as far as we were able, our doctrines and usages from all unjust
   imputations. It will be found in the sequel that we were called upon to
   sustain an arduous conflict with our brethren of other denominations,
   as well as with some of our own household, who, for various reasons,
   "went out from us," in order to rescue our ministry from reproach, and
   our doctrines, government, and usages from the numerous objections
   which were preferred against them.

   Another thing tended about this time to direct our attention to the
   general state of the religious affairs in our country. Allusion has
   already been made to the "Charitable Society for the Education of pious
   Young Men for the Ministry of the Gospel," and of the commission which
   was sent to explore the western country, and to report the religious
   state of things in that portion of our republic.

   To awaken public attention to the necessity and importance of
   sustaining this society, Dr. Lyman Beecher, in behalf of the society,
   issued an address to the churches, calling on them for pecuniary aid,
   to support and educate indigent pious young men for the ministry,
   assigning, among other reasons, the peculiar fitness of such young men,
   from their more hardy character and habits of life, to enter upon this
   rugged field of labor. To make the deeper and more powerful impression
   upon the Christian community in favor of the object proposed, the
   address went into a statistical account of the religious state of the
   several portions of our country, and concluded by a most rousing appeal
   to the sympathies and liberality of the people in behalf of the
   Education Society. In describing the moral and spiritual desolation of
   these United States, the address disclosed the astounding fact, that,
   in addition to those already in the services of the sanctuary, there
   were wanting "five thousand competent ministers," to supply the entire
   population of our country with the word and ordinances of the gospel.

   At the announcement of this fact, the Christian community awoke as from
   a deep slumber. They began to look around them for the data on which
   this calculation was founded. On examination, it was ascertained that
   the address assumed the necessity of one minister to every one thousand
   souls -- that, as there were at time eight millions of inhabitants in
   the United States and territories, and as there were, says the address,
   only three thousand educated ministers in the land, there remained five
   millions of the inhabitants destitute of a competent ministry. This was
   an alarming conclusion.

   Among others who published strictures on this strange production, the
   late Rev. Freeborn Garrettson wrote a small pamphlet, in which he
   showed the effect which the statements set forth in the address must
   have upon other denominations. He, as well as others who examined the
   statistics of Dr. Beecher, concluded that he meant to exclude all other
   ministers than those of the Calvinistic order from being "competent" to
   the work in which they were engaged; for, on a very moderate
   calculation, there were even then more than three thousand ministers
   belonging to the Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and Congregational
   churches; and it is believed that among the Baptist, Lutheran,
   Protestant, and Methodist Episcopal Churches, without saying any thing
   of the minor sects, there were more than five thousand ministers, many
   of whom would by no means suffer from a comparison with their brethren
   of the other denominations; hence, allowing the accuracy of this
   calculation, there was at that very time more than one minister for
   every one thousand human souls; the irresistible conclusion therefore
   was, that the address excluded from the catalogue of competent
   ministers all except those who belonged to one or the other of the
   Calvinistic churches above named. And this conclusion is strengthened
   by the fact, that the address dwelt so emphatically upon the necessity
   of "an educated ministry" as being essential to the efficient discharge
   of its duties, as it is well known that most of the other churches,
   however highly they might appreciate human learning, do not consider it
   an essential prerequisite to a gospel ministry.

   Such a disclosure of opinions, so deeply implicating the character and
   competency of so many ministers, many of whom had furnished the most
   irrefutable evidence of their efficiency in spreading the doctrines of
   God our Saviour, taken in connection with the report from the
   commission sent to explore our western country, might well alarm the
   apprehensions of all concerned; and hence a deep tone of
   dissatisfaction was heard throughout the churches, and a general burst
   of indignation against the assumptions of the address was
   simultaneously expressed by the several denominations who felt that
   their ministry were proscribed by its unwarrantable conclusions. The
   zeal, too, with which the address urged its claims upon the churches
   more immediately interested in its objects, showed that a mighty effort
   was making to carry into practical effect its comprehensive plans. As
   an evidence of this take the following extract: --

   "To produce such a combination and such an effort, the wretched state
   of our country must be made known. The information contained in this
   address may with propriety, it is believed, be communicated on the
   sabbath to all our worshipping assemblies, and the investigation
   commenced in it be continued, until a regular and minute account be
   given of the religious state of our land. The newspaper, the tract, and
   magazine must disclose to our slumbering countrymen their danger. The
   press must groan in the communication of our wretchedness; and from
   every pulpit in our land the trumpet must sound long and loud. The
   nation must be awakened to save itself by its own energies, or we are
   undone."

   We have no right, nor have we any wish, to decide upon the character of
   men's motives, any further than their words and actions proclaim it.
   And allowing that the end proposed by the gentlemen who wrote and
   sanctioned this address was purely the salvation of souls from sin, and
   the salvation of our country from its ruinous consequences, the means
   used were highly laudable, and the stirring language of the address, a
   fair sample of which is found in the preceding extract, was admirably
   calculated to arouse the slumbering energies of the church to a zealous
   activity in the cause of reform. Yet it could not but seem somewhat
   strange to us, that they should not have awakened to this all-important
   subject until just then -- at a time too when other denominations, and
   particularly the Methodists, had been blessed with the most extensive
   revivals of religion which had been witnessed in any age or land since
   the apostolic days. This is fully attested by the preceding volume of
   this History. Were the authors of this address ignorant of these facts?
   We had reason to believe that it was a knowledge of them which aroused
   their dormant energies, and led them just then to put forth their
   strength to counteract the growing influence of Methodism. For it was
   to the western country chiefly, and in the southern states, that this
   society were about to direct their efforts to supply the lack of
   ministerial service. And it was in the west more especially that our
   ministry had been so abundantly blessed. It was here, where the
   inhabitants from the older states and from Europe were pouring in with
   unparalleled rapidity, that, through the agency of camp meetings, and a
   general itinerant ministry, Methodism had already wrought wonders, and
   was still going forward, keeping pace with the extension of the
   settlements, and bowing the hearts of sinners to the yoke of Jesus
   Christ. Had we not, therefore, reason to suspect that our ministry
   especially were denounced as incompetent, and that the fear was the
   country would become deluged with the bitter waters issuing from the
   corrupt fountain of Methodism! Whether true or false, such was the
   impression, and therefore, in conjunction with others who felt
   themselves deeply implicated by the assumptions of this remarkable
   address, we felt ourselves authorized to enter our protest against its
   doctrines, and to furnish the people with an antidote to its injurious
   insinuations. This, as I have before said, was done by Mr. Garrettson;
   and the following extract from his pamphlet will show the successful
   manner in which he exposed and refuted the erroneous calculations of
   the address. Addressing himself directly to Dr. Beecher, he thus shows
   the fallacy of his arguments: --

   "You have placed your church in Connecticut on the highest scale among
   the several states in the Union. You have given a short history of it,
   and have, in your way, prostrated the southern part of our country.
   Probably you are a native of Connecticut; I was born in Maryland; and
   as you have, among other southern states, undertaken to degrade the
   religious character of the people of this state, I am willing to
   compare them with those of your state. I am well acquainted with about
   every part of both; and as you have fixed your eye on the
   Congregational Church in Connecticut, I shall fix mine on the Methodist
   Episcopal Church in Maryland.

   "You say that you have upward of 200 congregations, averaging 50
   members each, making about 10,000 church members. I have looked over
   our church records, and find that we have in Maryland [2] more than
   25,000 church members, who have the pure word of God preached, and the
   sacraments duly administered."

   It was, moreover, the opinion of many, that the address had a political
   object in view. This opinion was founded on the following extract,
   taken in connection with the conclusion which seems to he warranted
   from the general tenor of the address, that ministers of other
   denominations were proscribed as being incompetent. After speaking of
   the defective character of the general government, on account of its
   not containing adequate provisions for its own permanency, the address
   adds

   "A remedy must be applied to this vital defect of our national
   organization. But what shall that remedy be? There can be but one. The
   consolidation of the state governments would be a despotism. But the
   prevalence of pious, intelligent, enterprising ministers through the
   nation, at the ratio of one for a thousand, would establish schools,
   and academies, and colleges, and habits and institutions of homogeneous
   influence. These would produce a sameness of views, and feelings, and
   interests, which would lay the foundation of our empire on a rock.
   Religion is the central attraction which must supply the deficiency of
   political affinity and interest. Religion is the bond of charity, which
   in storms must undergird the skip."

   We accord to the soundness of these sentiments, provided they apply to
   Christianity as a system of universal good-will to men, and as designed
   and calculated to connect the hearts of all together in one common
   brotherhood, and finally to produce, by its action on the heart and
   conduct, a conformity to its holy precepts. But the general contents
   and manifest tendency of the address seemed to forbid such a
   construction, and to place its authors in the position of strong
   sectarists, who were laboring to build up a particular denomination at
   the expense of all the rest. This "homogeneous influence" -- this
   "sameness of views, and feelings, and interests," were to be produced
   by the multiplication of "educated and competent ministers," who should
   be trained up in the school of this society, who should receive their
   lessons of instruction from Andover, and thence go out clothed with
   authority to propagate Calvinism, whether under the form of the Old or
   New School Divinity, whether in the guise of Congregational or
   Presbyterian theology; while it appeared manifest that all others were
   proscribed as heterodox and incompetent, and therefore could not
   contribute to throw around the national ship, in time of a tempest, the
   strong cords of pure religion, and thus save the nation for a political
   wreck.

   We do not indeed say that this was the real design of the authors of
   this address; but if it were not, it was most unhappily worded, and
   should have been either corrected or disavowed, neither of which, so
   far as is known to the present writer, has ever been done, although I
   believe that the inferences which were drawn from it, and the general
   indignation it produced in a great portion of the religious community,
   caused its authors to withdraw it from circulation. [3]

   Thus much I have thought it a duty to say in respect to this
   controversy, because of its immediate bearing on the interests of our
   Church, and its more remote tendency upon its future history. It
   certainly tended to keep alive the fire of contention between us and
   the Calvinistic churches, and thus to widen the breach already existing
   between the two great families, the Calvinists and Arminians.

   There was another event of general interest which occurred this year,
   and which had a favorable bearing upon our affairs, particularly in the
   state of Connecticut. In this state the original charter, which was
   received from the king of England on the first settlement of the
   country, had been the only constitution the state had possessed up to
   the time of which we now speak. It is well known that in the early
   settlement of that colony, provision was made by law that no person
   should vote at an election, or hold a civil office, unless he were a
   member of the church. This severe and impolitic law was afterward so
   far relaxed as to allow those who joined the "half-way covenant," in
   order to obtain Christian baptism for their children, to be eligible to
   civil offices, and to exercise the right of suffrage. Still, however,
   the law was exclusive in its demands, making it essential, in order to
   possess civil rights, to he either in the "half-way covenant," that is,
   members of the Congregational society, or otherwise to become full
   members of that church. By these civil regulations the
   Congregationalists were established by law, and were supported by a
   regular tax, while other sects were held under civil disabilities,
   being obliged, in addition to supporting themselves, to contribute
   their quota for the maintenance of the established clergy, at the same
   time that they were disfranchised from the privileges of freemen, by an
   exclusion from all offices of trust and profit. Nor could the clergy of
   the Dissenters perform the rites of matrimony even for members of their
   own congregations.

   These severe and unjust regulations were so far modified from time to
   time as to allow those who belonged to dissentient sects the privilege
   of depositing a certificate in the town clerk's office of their having
   separated themselves from the "standing order," and they were thereby
   exempted from paying ministerial tax for the maintenance of the
   established clergy. They were also entitled to hold offices in the
   state, and to vote at the elections.

   Such was the general state of things in Connecticut, when some
   circumstances happened which resulted in the overthrow of this legal
   hierarchy, and placed all the religious sects upon an equal standing,
   both in civil and religious affairs.

   During the war of 1812-1815, the militia of that state were called out,
   by order of the general government, to defend the people against the
   apprehended depredations of the enemy. The authorities of the state,
   however, refused to let their militia serve under United States'
   officers, but they were marshaled under those appointed by the state.
   The consequence was, that the general government refused to pay the
   expense of the campaign. After the restoration of peace, the state of
   Connecticut petitioned Congress to refund the amount which the state
   had expended in paying for the services of the militia during the late
   war, a part of which was granted by the general government, and paid
   into the treasury of the state. The legislature of Connecticut, with a
   view to conciliate all parties, resolved that the money thus refunded
   should be divided among the several religious denominations, which was
   accordingly done; but, in the estimation of the Protestant and
   Methodist Episcopalians and Baptists, the division was so unequal, such
   an undue proportion being given to the Congregationalists, that they
   took offense, some of them refusing to receive what was awarded to
   them, and all united to protest against the proceedings as illiberal,
   unequal, and unjust. This led to a union of effort between the
   dissatisfied denominations against the standing order; and, seizing
   upon the occasion as an auspicious moment to assert their rights, they
   succeeded in calling a state convention, by which the old charter of
   Charles II was abrogated, a bill of rights promulgated, and a new
   constitution framed and adopted, which abolished church taxes and
   exclusive privileges, and put all sects upon an equality in respect to
   civil and religious rights; and thus they enfranchised the proscribed
   portion of the community, making all alike dependent on the voluntary
   principle for the support of the clergy and other incidents of divine
   worship.

   This result was hailed as an auspicious period by the friends of equal
   rights, both in and out of the churches, as it did away the odious
   distinction between the privileged order, who had been so long
   established by law, and the various sects which had sprung up in the
   state, some of whom were nearly as numerous as were the
   Congregationalists themselves, and, when united with the others, formed
   a decided majority.

   This was breaking the last link of legal tyranny in religious matters
   in our country -- with the exception, perhaps, of some of its relics
   which are dangling upon the civil code of Massachusetts -- by
   proclaiming to all the rights of conscience, according to the laws of
   nature, of God, and the fundamental principles of our national
   constitution.

   Having noticed these matters, because they had and still have a bearing
   upon our history, I shall now proceed in the narration of the affairs
   of our Church in their regular order.

   The death of Bishop Asbury, as related in the preceding chapter, left
   us with only one superintendent, Bishop McKendree, and he was in a very
   delicate state of health. He continued, however, to discharge his
   official duties, and was much supported in his labors by the good
   countenance of his brethren in the ministry and membership.

   The number of Church members for 1816 shows that the increase was
   small, as the country had not yet fully recovered from the shock it had
   received from the late war, nor was the spirit of revival and
   reformation in that holy and vigorous exercise, by which it had shown
   itself at some former periods. Indeed, a disputatious spirit, in
   respect to some points of church government, engrossed too much of the
   time and attention of many, it is to be feared, to the neglect of the
   "weightier matters of the law, judgment, justice, and the love of God."

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This Year: 171,931; Last Year:167,978;
   Increase: 3,953 -- Colored This Year: 42,304; Last Year: 43,187;
   Decrease: 883 -- Total This Year: 214,235; Last Year: 211,165 --
   Increase: 3,070 -- Preachers This Year: 695; Last Year: 704; Decrease:
   9.

   It will be perceived from the above that there was a decrease of nearly
   nine hundred colored members. This was owing to a defection among the
   colored people in the city of Philadelphia, by which upward of one
   thousand in that city withdrew from our Church and set up for
   themselves, with Richard Allen, a colored local preacher and elder in
   the Methodist Episcopal Church -- at their head.

   We have already had occasion to notice the labors of the Methodist
   ministry in behalf of the colored population of our country, both free
   and enslaved. Many thousands had become members of the Church, and were
   in general orderly and exemplary in their conduct; and some of those
   who were free had acquired wealth and respectability in the community.
   Among these converted Negroes a considerable number, possessing gifts
   for the edification of their brethren, had received license to preach,
   and several had been ordained deacons, and a few to the office of local
   elders.

   Among the latter was Richard Allen, of Philadelphia. By habits of
   industry and economy, though born a slave in one of the southern
   states, he had not only procured his freedman, but acquired
   considerable wealth, and, since he had exercised the office of a
   preacher and an elder, obtained great influence over his brethren in
   the Church. By his assistance, and the assistance of their white
   brethren, they had built them a decent house of worship, and were
   regularly organized into a Christian church, according to our
   disciplinary regulations, and were put under the pastoral oversight of
   a white elder, stationed by the bishop presiding in the Philadelphia
   conference.

   Under this state of things all seemed to go on well and prosperously.
   Mutual affection and confidence between the white and colored
   congregations, not in that city only, but also in most of the populous
   cities and villages in the Union, promised the most happy results of
   their united endeavors to promote their temporal and spiritual welfare.
   This harmony, however, was, by some untoward circumstances,
   interrupted. Mutual distrust and dissatisfaction succeeded, until
   finally Allen, and those who had been brought under his influence,
   separated themselves from the Methodist Episcopal Church. This occurred
   in the month of April, 1816.

   At the secession they organized themselves into an independent body,
   under the title of the "African Methodist Episcopal Church," adopting
   our doctrines as their standards, and, as far as their circumstances
   would seem to allow, our form of discipline for their government. At
   their first General Conference, held in April of this year, Richard
   Allen was elected to the office of a bishop, and was consecrated by
   prayer and the imposition of the hands of five colored local elders,
   one of whom, Absalom Jones, was a priest of the Protestant Episcopal
   Church. Though the circumstances which led to this secession produced
   some exasperation of spirit on both sides, at the time, yet it is
   stated by one of their first ministers, that they have prospered
   considerably in various parts of the country. At their conference in
   1828, one of their elders, Morris Brown, was elected and ordained a
   joint superintendent with Richard Allen; and after the death of the
   latter, in 1836, Edward Watters was set apart with the usual forms of
   consecration, as a joint superintendent with Mr. Brown.

   Whether they are better or worse off than they would have been had they
   remained in connection with the Church and ministry to which they were
   indebted for their spiritual and ecclesiastical existence, is more than
   we have the means of knowing. Be this as it may, the secession created
   for the time considerable uneasiness among our colored congregations in
   New York city and some other places, which resulted in their separation
   also, although they did not all arrange themselves under the banners of
   Allen. They adopted the itinerant mode of preaching, and have spread
   themselves in different parts of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey,
   Maryland, and Delaware states, though it is believed that their
   congregations, out of the city of Philadelphia, are generally small,
   and not very influential. There are also some in the western states,
   and a few in Upper Canada. The exact number belonging to this party I
   have not been able to ascertain.

   In the more southern states, the "Allenites," as they were called, by
   way of distinction, could make no favorable impression, as their
   preachers were not recognized by the laws of the states, and the slave
   population who were members of our Church had the character of our
   white ministry pledged as a guarantee for their good behavior.

   The first thing which arrested the attention of all, and which seemed
   to spread a melancholy gloom over the house, was the absence of our
   venerated senior bishop, whose death and character I have recorded in
   the preceding volume.

   After making preparations for the removal of his remains from the place
   of their first sepulcher, his valedictory address was read to the
   conference, which appeared to have been left in an unfinished state,
   containing merely the heads of what he would probably have drawn out at
   greater length, had his declining health permitted. It shows, however,
   the same intense and enlarged desire for the permanency and prosperity
   of the Church by which he had so long been characterized, expressed in
   his usually sententious [pithy, concise, moralizing -- DVM] style, and
   concluded with an earnest exhortation to the conference to hold fast
   the doctrines and discipline under the influence of which they had been
   hitherto bound together, blessed, and prospered.

   After the conference was organized, by the appointment of a secretary,
   and attending to the usual preliminary business, Bishop McKendree, who,
   by the death of Bishop Asbury, was the only surviving superintendent,
   delivered to the conference an address -- a copy of which I have not
   been able to find in the general state of the work, and the necessity
   of adding strength to the episcopacy. He also made such suggestions as
   he thought fit in respect to future movements for the general peace and
   prosperity of our extended work. This address, and Bishop Asbury's
   valedictory, were referred to appropriate committees, the reports of
   which will be noticed in due time.

   The Rev. Messrs. Black and Bennett, of Nova Scotia, attended this
   conference as delegates from the British conference, in order to
   adjust, if possible, certain difficulties which had arisen in Canada,
   particularly in the lower province, out of what had taken place during
   the late war. As this sanguinary conflict had occasioned a temporary
   separation between us and the brethren in that country, the societies
   in Montreal and Quebec had petitioned the mission committee in London
   to supply them with preachers, and their petition had been granted and
   preachers sent. This occasioned some uneasiness in the minds of our
   preachers in that country, and led to unhappy collisions between the
   two bodies of Methodists, which resulted finally in the separation of
   the Methodists in those provinces from the jurisdiction of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, and their union with the Wesleyan
   Methodists in England.

   Some correspondence had taken place between our bishops and the
   Wesleyan Methodist conference, in relation to this unhappy affair; and
   at this General Conference the following letter was received from the
   missionary committee of London, and submitted to the conference, in
   connection with communications from the Rev. Messrs. Black and Bennett,
   in behalf of the British connection, and Rev. Messrs. Ryan and Case, in
   behalf of the brethren in Canada. The letter, which follows, it
   appears, was addressed to Bishop Asbury, in answer to one they had
   received from him. It is as follows: --

   "New Chapel, City Road, London, Feb. 7, 1816

   "Very Dear Sir: -- It is by the particular request of the last British
   conference that we, as members of the missionary committee, address
   you, and our brethren in the United States, whom we very highly esteem
   as fellow-citizens of the saints, and fellow-laborers in the vineyard
   of our common Lord; most fervently wishing that peace, righteousness,
   and joy in the Holy Ghost may abound in you and by you, to the praise
   of God and the glory of his grace.

   "On reading your last very kind and affectionate letter, we sympathized
   with you, knowing how much it must have affected your mind, after being
   favored with so much spiritual prosperity, to have to lament a decrease
   of members in your societies;' but we trust, since it hath pleased
   Divine Providence to cause the terrors of war to cease, and to restore
   the invaluable blessing of peace between the two countries, that by
   this time you hail the dawn of a more auspicious day, and see the
   returning glory of the Lord revealed, and the quickening power of the
   Spirit diffusing its reviving influence, and that the voice of joy and
   rejoicing is heard in the congregations of the righteous, Glory to God
   in the highest, peace upon earth, and good-will toward men.' Our united
   prayer and supplication for you is, O Lord, we beseech, O Lord, we
   beseech, send now prosperity!'

   It is with gratitude to the Lord of all that we can say, he is still
   extending his kingdom among us, by the instrumentality of the preached
   word; and his servants have had much consolation in their labors, by
   seeing sinners powerfully convinced of sin, penitents born of God, and
   believers sanctified by the Spirit. God has lately been reviving his
   work in various places, particularly in the city of Bristol, at
   Salisbury, &c.: in the former place several hundreds have been brought
   to the knowledge of God their Saviour. We can assure you we love this
   good, old-fashioned religion,' of a deep conviction for sin, a clear
   sense of justification by faith, and entire sanctification of the soul
   from all moral pollution, as well, if not better than ever. Blessed be
   the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us, and
   does even now bless us, with these spiritual blessings in heavenly
   places in Christ Jesus: and we ever pray with increasing desire, Thy
   kingdom come.'

   "Our blessed Lord has greatly favored us with success in our missionary
   efforts, particularly in our new stations in the eastern world, Ceylon,
   &c., though this has been attended with its afflictive circumstances.
   Since the death of our venerable, highly esteemed, and much lamented
   friend and brother, Dr. Coke, our beloved brother Ault has been removed
   from a sphere of useful labor to his great reward. The other brethren
   are still preserved in their useful labors. A Buddhist priest of
   considerable learning has been converted to Christianity, and is now
   engaged in translating the Scriptures into two of the native languages.
   Several Moormen or Mohammedans have also received the truth, and are
   becoming useful preachers of the word of life; and thousands of the
   poor heathen flock to hear the joyful tidings of the gospel. Our
   missionaries have begun to build a large chapel, house, school,
   printing-office, &c., at Columbo, and have received the liberal support
   of the inhabitants. These buildings are to cost seven thousand dollars,
   six thousand of which have been already subscribed by the inhabitants.
   We have lately sent five more missionaries to that quarter of the
   globe, and one more is shortly to sail for Bombay. Thus the Lord is
   enlarging his kingdom, even from the rivers to the ends of the earth.'

   "We rejoice in the ardent Christian affection you express toward your
   brethren in this country; and be assured they entertain the same lively
   feelings and sentiments of brotherly love toward you and your
   fellow-laborers in the Lord; and should we be favored with a visit from
   you or them, it would give us inexpressible pleasure to give you the
   right hand of fellowship, and every expression of our sincere Christian
   regard.

   "To preserve a mutual good understanding, and the unity of the Spirit,
   and, as far as possible, a co-operation in promoting the good work of
   the Lord, we feel it our duty to state to you a subject of local
   difference, which to us has been painful, and which we feel a delicacy
   in stating, but to which we are compelled from the necessity of the
   case, that the word of the Lord be not hindered. In consequence of
   application being made to the British conference from the society at
   Montreal, a missionary was sent to that place, and received as the
   messenger of the gospel of peace; but we are sorry to learn that some
   misunderstanding has taken place between brothers Strong and Williams,
   our missionaries, and brother Ryan, your presiding elder for Lower
   Canada. From the former we have received a statement of their
   proceedings, and from the latter a letter of complaint. We have also
   received a letter from brother Bennett, the chairman of the Nova Scotia
   district, who has visited Montreal, &c., and reported to us his
   proceedings.

   "Upon a review of the whole, and from the most serious and deliberate
   consideration we are led to conclude that, considering the relative
   situation of the inhabitants of Montreal and of Canada to this country,
   and particularly as a principal part of the people appear to be in
   favor of our missionaries, it would be for their peace and comfort, and
   the furtherance of the gospel, for our brethren to occupy those
   stations, especially the former, and to which we conceive we have a
   claim, as a considerable part of the money for building the chapel and
   house was raised in this country. We trust our American brethren will
   see the propriety of complying with our wishes with respect to those
   places; not to mention their political relation to this country, which,
   however, is not of little importance, for we are conscious that their
   general habits and prejudices are in favor of English preachers, being
   more congenial to their views and feelings, which should certainly be
   consulted, and will tend to facilitate the success of the gospel, and
   their spiritual prosperity. As your and our object is mutually to
   diffuse the knowledge of him whose kingdom is not of this world, and by
   every possible means to promote the immortal interests of men, let us
   not contend -- we have one Master, even Christ -- but give place to
   each other, that the word of the Lord may have free course, run, and be
   glorified. We cannot but hope, that from the contiguity of the labors
   of the brethren belonging to the two conferences, the spirit of unity
   and love will be promoted, and by this measure a more perfect
   reciprocal intercourse established. As you have kindly invited our
   esteemed brethren, Messrs. Black and Bennett, to take a seat in your
   conference, we have directed them to pay you a visit at Baltimore for
   this purpose, and to amicably arrange and settle this business, whom we
   trust you will receive as our representatives and as brethren.

   "Praying that our mutual love may abound yet more and more, and that we
   may ever enjoy and rejoice in each other's prosperity, till the whole
   earth is filled with the glory of God, we remain your truly
   affectionate brethren in Christ Jesus.

   (Signed for and in behalf of the committee.) "James Wood, Treasurer,
   Joseph Benson, James Buckley, Secretary."

   This letter, together with the written and verbal communications from
   the brethren above mentioned, was referred to a committee, and the
   following report, which was concurred in by the conference, will show
   the result of their labors: --

   "The committee appointed by the General Conference to confer with
   Messrs. Black and Bennett, delegates appointed by the London Methodist
   Missionary Society to represent the British connection to this
   conference, and, if possible, to make an amicable adjustment of certain
   differences between our Church and the British connection, relative to
   Upper and Lower Canada, beg leave to submit the following report, viz.:
   --
    1. Your committee have had several friendly interviews with the
       above-mentioned delegates on those subjects, and they are happy to
       state that there appears to be an earnest desire to have all
       existing difficulties terminated to the peace and mutual
       satisfaction of both parties, and to perpetuate the Christian union
       and good understanding which have hitherto existed.
    2. It appears from written communications, as well as from verbal
       testimony, that unhappy dissensions have taken place in Montreal
       between certain missionaries sent (at the request of a few official
       members of the society in that place, in time of the last war) by
       the London Missionary Society, and some American preachers, which
       have terminated in the division of that society.
    3. Although the late hostilities between the two countries separated,
       for some time, those provinces from the immediate superintendency
       of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America, yet all the circuits
       (except Quebec) were as regularly supplied as circumstances would
       admit of with American preachers.
    4. It furthermore appears, from written and verbal communications,
       that it is the desire of the great majority of the people in Upper
       and Lower Canada to be supplied, as heretofore, with preachers from
       the United States.
    5. In the two provinces there are twelve circuits and one station,
       (Montreal,) which have eleven meeting-houses, which have been
       hitherto supplied by American preachers.

   "These things being duly considered, together with the contiguity of
   those provinces to the western and northern parts of the United States,
   your committee respectfully submit the following resolutions: --

   "Resolved by the delegates of the Annual Conference of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, in General Conference assembled,
    1. That we cannot, consistently with our duty to the societies of our
       charge in the Canadas, give up any part of them, or any of our
       chapels in those provinces, to the superintendence of the British
       connection.
    2. That a respectful letter be addressed to the London Methodist
       Missionary Society, explaining the reasons for the above
       resolution."

   A letter was accordingly addressed to the missionary committee of
   London, explanatory of the reasons which led to the conclusions stated
   in the above report, and requesting that the preachers of each
   connection might be permitted to occupy in peace their respective
   fields of labor; but, whatever might have been the pacific disposition
   of the two bodies of Methodists in Great Britain and the United States,
   and however sincere and ardent their desire for mutual good
   understanding and brotherly affection, there were local feelings
   existing in the societies in some places, particularly in Montreal and
   Kingston, which could not be so easily satisfied; hence the society in
   the former place remained in a divided state, one party being supplied
   from England, and the other from the United States: and thus Judah
   continued to vex Ephraim, until, after a lapse of some years, an
   amicable arrangement was made between the British and American
   connection.

   It was beyond all controversy that the present state of the work
   required an additional number of bishops. Accordingly the committee on
   the episcopacy reported as follows in reference to this subject, which
   was concurred in by the conference: --

   "1. It is the opinion of your committee that the state of the
   superintendency, in consequence of the ever to be lamented death of our
   venerable father, Bishop Asbury, and the impaired state of the health
   of Bishop McKendree, and the increasing extent of the work, is such as
   require immediate and adequate strengthening;" and hence they
   recommended that two additional bishops be elected and consecrated."

   On May 14, Enoch George and Robert Richford Roberts were elected by
   ballot, the former having fifty-seven and the latter fifty-five votes
   out of one hundred and six that were cast. They were accordingly
   consecrated in due form, and, after the adjournment of conference,
   entered upon their peculiar work with zeal and energy.

   The effect of the numerous locations on the ministry, and the want of
   more efficient means for its intellectual improvement, induced this
   conference to appoint a committee to take these subjects into
   consideration, and, if practicable, provide an adequate remedy. And as
   the report of this committee, and the action of the conference thereon,
   had a very important bearing upon these interests, the report, as it
   was adopted by the conference, is given entire.

   "The committee of ways and means, appointed to provide a more ample
   support of the ministry among us, to prevent locations, and the
   admission of improper persons into the itinerancy, have taken the
   subjects committed to them under serious consideration. They have
   found, with serious concern and deep regret, that, in the present state
   of things, there exist many evils, which threaten to undermine that
   system of itinerating preaching which, under the blessing of God, has
   been so successful in spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.
    1. The small pittance allowed to our preachers, and, in many places,
       the inefficient means used to insure even that, we conceive to be
       one reason why so many of our useful ministers are induced to
       locate. Groaning under the pressure of poverty now, and looking
       forward to a superannuated state, without adequate means afforded
       them for a comfortable support in the decline of life, they sink
       under the melancholy prospect, and reluctantly retire from the
       field, that they may provide a morsel of bread for themselves,
       their wives, and children.
    2. The many locations, from these and other causes, have a manifest
       tendency to weaken and embarrass the itinerancy, by obliging us to
       fill up the vacancies with persons not competent to the work
       assigned them, and to commit the administration, in some of its
       important branches, to the hands of young and inexperienced men.
    3. To the same causes we may attribute the many partial locations,
       that is, families of traveling preachers which are immovably fixed.
       Their scanty allowance furnishes an excuse (whether justifiable or
       not, your committee presume not to determine) for combining
       farming, mercantile business, &c., with the ministration of God's
       word. This practice, in the opinion of your committee, exceedingly
       embarrasses the general superintendency, in the frequent changes
       which, in the discharge of its duty, are unavoidable. In
       consequence of this, either those whose families are thus located
       must be subject to distant removals from their families, or others
       must be exposed to the inconvenience of frequent and distant
       removals, to make way for those who are in this partially located
       state.
    4. We perceive a manifest defect among us, occasioned in some measure
       by the multiplicity of locations, in regard to ministerial
       qualifications. Although a collegiate education is not, by your
       committee, deemed essential to a gospel ministry, yet it appears
       absolutely necessary for every minister of the gospel to study to
       show himself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be
       ashamed. Every one, therefore, who would be useful as a minister in
       the Church, should, to a sincere piety and laudable zeal for the
       salvation of souls, add an ardent desire for useful knowledge; --
       he should strive by every lawful means to imbue his mind with every
       science which is intimately connected with the doctrine of
       salvation by Jesus Christ, and which will enable him to understand
       and illustrate the sacred Scriptures. But the early departure of
       many from the work of the ministry among us, of those whose piety,
       zeal, talent, and mental improvement justified the expectation of
       their extensive usefulness in the Church, and the manifest
       indifference of some who remain with us to this important branch of
       ministerial duty, thus stripping the Church of some of its
       brightest ornaments, not only exposes her nakedness, but loudly
       calls for the prompt and vigorous interference of the General
       Conference. To obviate these evils, and to secure to the Church a
       succession of holy, zealous, and useful ministers, becomes at this
       time, in the humble opinion of your committee, the imperious duty
       of this conference. To accomplish these very desirable objects,
       your committee beg leave to recommend the following resolutions,
       viz.:

   Resolved.
    1. That it shall be the duty of the presiding elders and preachers to
       use their influence to carry the rule of Discipline relating to
       building and renting houses for accommodation of preachers and
       families into effect. In order to this, each quarterly meeting
       conference shall appoint a committee, (unless other measures have
       been adopted,) who, with the aid and advice of the preachers and
       presiding elder, shall devise such means as may seem fit to raise
       moneys for that purpose. And we furthermore recommend to each
       annual conference to make special inquiry of its members respecting
       this part of their duty.
    2. That those preachers who refuse to occupy the houses which may be
       provided for them on the stations and circuits where they are from
       time to time appointed, shall be allowed nothing for house-rent,
       nor receive anything more than their simple quarterage for
       themselves, wives, and children, and their traveling expenses.
       Nevertheless, this rule shall not apply to those preachers whose
       families are either established within the bounds of their circuits
       or stations, or are so situated that, in the judgment of the
       stewards, or the above-mentioned committee, it is not necessary for
       the benefit of the circuit to remove them.
    3. That that part of the Discipline which relates to the temporal
       economy of our Church be so altered as to make the annual allowance
       of preachers one hundred dollars, and that of their wives and
       widows one hundred dollars.
    4. That there be a committee appointed by the quarterly meeting
       conference of every circuit and station, consisting of members of
       the Methodist Episcopal Church, whose duty it shall be to make an
       estimate of the amount necessary to furnish fuel and table expenses
       of the family or families of the preachers stationed with them, and
       that the stewards shall provide, by such means as they shall
       devise, to meet such expenses, in money or otherwise; -- provided
       that the quarterly allowance of the preachers shall first be paid
       by the stewards.
    5. That there be a meeting in every district of one steward from each
       station and circuit, to be selected from among the stewards by the
       quarterly conference, whose duty it shall be, by and with the
       advice of the presiding elders who shall preside in such meeting,
       to take into consideration the general state of the district in
       regard to temporalities, and to furnish a house and provision for
       the presiding elders' families, in conformity to the first and
       fourth resolutions of this report.

   "In order more effectually to provide for the distressed traveling,
   superannuated, and supernumerary preachers, their wives, widows, and
   children, your committee earnestly recommend,

   6.?That each annual conference, in such way and manner as they may
   think proper, raise a fund for these purposes, according to the 6th
   article of the 5th section of the temporal economy of our Church.

   "Thinking the Discipline sufficiently explicit on those points which
   relate to the Christian experience, practice, &c., of preachers, your
   committee deem it needless to add any thing on these subjects. But they
   beg leave to recommend,

   7.?That it be the duty of the bishop or bishops, or a committee which
   they may appoint in each annual conference, to point out a course of
   reading and study proper to be pursued by candidates for the ministry;
   and the presiding elders, whenever a person is presented as a candidate
   for the ministry, shall direct him to those studies which have been
   thus recommended. And before any such candidate shall be received into
   full connection, he shall give satisfactory evidence respecting his
   knowledge of those particular subjects which have been recommended to
   his consideration."

   The adoption of this report, it is believed, had a salutary influence
   upon the ministry and membership, by exciting a spirit of liberality,
   and leading to a more vigorous action in respect to acquiring a greater
   amount of ministerial qualification.

   From that time forth a regular course of study has been prescribed by
   the bishops for those on trial in the annual conferences, to which the
   candidates must attend, and give satisfactory evidence of their
   attainments, especially in theological science, before they can be
   admitted into full membership as itinerant ministers. Though the course
   of study at first was very limited in some of the conferences, and the
   examinations comparatively superficial, it has been gradually enlarged
   and improved, so much so as to require a great compass of knowledge to
   be able to pass an approved examination. Still there is much wanting to
   give that thorough training which is most desirable for the full and
   profitable development of the mental powers, and their energetic
   application in the field of usefulness.

   A committee of safety was also appointed, who reported that doctrines
   in some instances adverse to the standards of our Church were
   insinuating themselves among us -- that the building churches with pews
   to rent or sell was gaining an ascendency in some places, and that the
   rules on dress and the manner of ministerial support were but
   negligently enforced: whereupon the following resolutions were adopted:
   --
    1. Resolved by the delegates of the annual conferences in General
       Conference assembled, That the General Conference do earnestly
       recommend the superintendents to make the most careful inquiry in
       all the annual conferences, in order to ascertain whether any
       doctrines are embraced or preached contrary to our established
       Articles of Faith; and to use their influence to prevent the
       existence and circulation of all such doctrines.
    2. Resolved, &c., That it be specially recommended to all the
       presiding elders and stationed and circuit preachers to take
       particular care that all our houses of worship be secured on the
       principles of our deed of settlement, in the form of Discipline.
    3. Resolved, &c., That the manner of building houses of religious
       worship with pews is contrary to the rules of our economy, and
       inconsistent with the interests of our societies.
    4. Resolved, &c., That it is the opinion of this conference that the
       practice of assessing and collecting taxes by civil law for the
       support of the ministers of the gospel is contrary to the temporal
       economy of our Church, and inconsistent with apostolic example;
       that it goes to impede the progress of experimental religion and
       destroy the itinerant plan. And the superintendents with all the
       annual conferences are hereby desired to take such measures as in
       their judgment will most effectually cure such an evil.
    5. Resolved, &c., That the superintendents, together with all the
       presiding elders and assistant preachers, be, and hereby are,
       earnestly requested to carry into effect, in their several charges,
       our rules on dress, family worship, love-feasts, class and society
       meetings.
    6. Resolved, &c., That no preacher having the charge of a circuit
       shall be allowed to divide or in any way to lessen the circuit,
       without the consent and advice of the presiding elder.
    7. Resolved, &c., That it be, and hereby is, recommended to the
       bishops and presiding elders, in the general and particular
       oversight of their charges, to guard against such divisions and
       reductions of districts and circuits, as in their judgment may be
       inconsistent with the temporal and spiritual interests of our
       societies, and the preservation of the energies of our itinerant
       system."

   No part of this report was incorporated in the Discipline, but it was
   ordered that it should be recorded on the journals of the several
   annual conferences, and, so far as relates to the building of churches
   with slips to rent or sell, it has remained a dead letter in many parts
   of our work. The practice of renting pews at that time was limited to a
   few places, but it has since extended more and more through the eastern
   and some of the more northern conferences, the people pleading the
   necessity of the case for a departure in this respect from the
   primitive usage of Methodism.

   It may be regretted that the state of society requires us to relinquish
   the mode of building churches with free seats; but as it is not
   pretended to be in itself sinful to rent or sell the seats, the
   expediency of the measure must he determined by the probable utility in
   any given place of resorting to this method of providing houses of
   worship. And when the question is put, "Shall we have such a house or
   none?" as is the case in many parts of our country, it is believed that
   hesitancy should be at an end, and that we should be guilty of a
   dereliction of duty were we to refuse to avail ourselves of this means
   to provide homes in which we may preach the gospel to sinners.

   It is, however, admitted, that houses with free seats, when they can be
   built and paid for, and the people induced to occupy them, are to be
   preferred; but if otherwise, it appears like an inexcusable pertinacity
   in so cleaving to a usage not expressly enjoined in Scripture, as to
   refuse to preach the gospel and administer the ordinances in a house of
   worship merely because the seats are rented.

   Sundry memorials from local preachers were presented to this General
   Conference, praying for an enlargement of their privileges: 1. To have
   a representation in the councils of the Church: 2. Be permitted a share
   in the administration of the discipline; and, 3. To stipulate with the
   people who might wish for their services for a certain amount of
   salary. The committee appointed to take these memorials into
   consideration reported as follows: --

   "Your committee are of opinion that the first request is inconsistent
   with the constitution of the General Conference; -- that the second is
   inexpedient; -- that as to the third, provision is already made for the
   relief of local preachers in certain cases, and it is the opinion of
   the committee that this General Conference ought not to make any
   further provision, except as is hereinafter recommended.

   "From an attentive inquiry into the state of the local preachers in all
   parts of our vast continent, we are happy to be able to say, that the
   great body of that very respectable and useful class of our brethren
   are, in our judgment, the firm friends and supporters of our doctrines,
   discipline, and Church government; and that by far the greater part of
   them would be much grieved at any radical changes in our present
   regulations. But upon examining those parts of our Discipline which
   respect local preachers, your committee beg leave to recommend the
   following amendments."

   On this recommendation the section relating to local preachers was so
   altered as to read as follows: --

   "Before any person shall be licensed to preach as a local preacher
   among us, he shall bring a recommendation from the society or class of
   which he is a member, and be personally examined before the quarterly
   meeting conference by the presiding elder, or, in his absence, by the
   preacher having the charge, touching his acquaintance with the
   doctrines of our Church, to which he shall declare his assent, together
   with his gifts and grace for preaching; and if he be approved by the
   quarterly meeting conference in these respects, and they believe he
   will be generally acceptable and useful as a preacher, he shall then
   receive a license, signed by the presiding elder, or, in his absence,
   by the preacher having charge, which license it shall be the duty of
   such local preacher to have annually renewed."

   After a few other verbal alterations, the section provided as follows:
   --

   "Whenever a local preacher shall remove from one circuit to another, he
   shall procure from the presiding elder of the district, or the preacher
   having the charge of the circuit, a certificate of his official
   standing in the Church at the time of his removal, without which he
   shall not be received as a local preacher in another place."

   The following item respecting the manner in which exhorters should
   receive authority to exercise their gifts was ordered to be inserted in
   the Discipline, and was so done accordingly. The preacher in charge,
   among other duties, was to have authority: --

   "To license such persons as he may judge proper to officiate as
   exhorters in the Church, provided no person shall be licensed without
   the consent of a leaders' meeting, or of the class of which he is a
   member, where no leaders' meeting is held; and the exhorters so
   authorized shall be subject to the annual examination of character in
   the quarterly meeting conference, and have their license annually
   renewed by the presiding elder, or the preacher having the charge, if
   approved of by the quarterly meeting conference."

   That part of the Discipline which relates to circuit stewards was so
   amended as to make them responsible to the quarterly meeting conference
   "for the faithful performance of their duties."

   Hitherto it had been the duty of an annual conference, if it had any
   surplus money on hand after paying its own claimants, to send it to the
   next conference. This regulation was so altered at this conference as
   to make it the duty of the annual conference to "send such surplus
   forward to that conference they judge to be most necessitous."

   As the two bishops who had been elected and consecrated at this
   conference were men of families, and as no provision had been made in
   the Discipline for the support of such families, it was ordered that
   the "book agents, in conjunction with the book committee New York, be
   authorized to estimate the sum to defray the necessary expenses of the
   bishops' families, for which they shall be authorized to draw on the
   editor and general book steward."

   Joshua Soule and Thomas Mason were elected book agents, and the
   conference renewed the order for the publication of the Methodist
   Magazine, in monthly numbers of forty octavo pages each, and required
   each annual conference to appoint a committee of three to receive and
   forward communications, and otherwise to furnish materials for the
   work. The Magazine, however, was not commenced till 1818, and the
   appointment of these committees answered no valuable purpose, as but
   little aid was afforded by them to the editors.

   These include all the acts of this conference worthy of public record,
   or which went to affect the general administration. On the 24th of May
   the business closed by adjournment, to meet again in the city of
   Baltimore, May 1, 1820.

   [2] Dr. Beecher had represented the state of Maryland as being in a
   most deplorable condition. After having said that Virginia, with a
   population of 974,622, needed 900 ministers in addition to the 60 it
   already had to make up the one for every one of the inhabitants, he
   says, "Of the state of Maryland we cannot speak particularly. But from
   general information on the subject, we have no reason to believe the
   supply any better than that of Virginia;" that is, as 60 to 900. He
   must therefore have considered either that the Methodists were not
   worthy to be included among Christian ministers and members of the
   church, or otherwise greatly depreciated the religious character of the
   state of Maryland.

   [3] Dr. Beecher, who wrote the address, in a conversation with the
   writer of this History, remarked that he had been misunderstood, and
   therefore had suffered much abuse from the public press, on account of
   the sentiments set forth in the address. It was asked, "Why, then, do
   you not explain yourself, and set the public right?" The reply was, "I
   cannot do it without making matters worse." From this it was inferred
   that he found himself in a dilemma, from which he could not extricate
   himself without offending one party or the other. I think it, however,
   but justice to say, that he disavowed any intention of producing any
   other political influence than what should arise from a religious
   purification of the moral atmosphere, so that men should come to the
   polls under the restraints of Christian principles and that by an
   educated ministry he did not mean a collegiate, but only a theological
   education.

CHAPTER 4

    From the Close of the General Conference of 1816 to the Commencement of the
    General Conference of 1820

  1817

   There were, by an act of the foregoing General Conference, two new
   conferences, namely Mississippi and Missouri, added to the number,
   making in all eleven annual conferences to be attended by the three
   bishops. Though some had contended that it would be most convenient to
   divide the episcopal supervision so as to apportion a specified
   district of country to each bishop, yet the majority thought it most
   advisable to leave these things to be regulated by the bishops
   themselves, as they might judge most convenient for an efficient
   oversight of the whole work; and they concluded that this object could
   be accomplished most easily and energetically by an interchange of
   labors, so that each bishop should visit all the conferences at least
   once in the four years. This, it was contended, would best answer the
   character of a general itinerating superintendency, prevent local
   interests and jealousies from springing up, and tend most effectually
   to preserve that homogeneousness of character and reciprocity of
   brotherly feeling by which Methodism had been and should be ever
   distinguished. The bishops accordingly commenced their labors on this
   plan, and, as far as health and other existing circumstances would
   allow, steadily pursued it until the close of their quadrennial term.

   The "Tract Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church" was formed this
   year, by some members of our Church, with a view to furnish the poorer
   class of the community with religious reading. It is true that a small
   society, managed by a few pious and benevolent females, had been formed
   a short time previously, but its operations were extremely limited. The
   society now formed took a wider range, and commenced publishing its
   tracts and distributing them with spirit and energy. It has gone on
   from that time to the present, increasing the number and variety of its
   tracts, and enlarging the sphere of its operations; and has done much
   good by diffusing abroad the truths of the gospel, by issuing
   doctrinal, experimental, and practical illustrations of the Holy
   Scriptures.

   This method of scattering among the great mass of the people, in the
   cheapest possible form, and in a small compass, religious knowledge,
   was begun by Mr. Wesley at an early period of his ministry, and was one
   of the means to which he resorted to effect the reformation and
   salvation of the world. Under date of Dec. 18, 1745, he says: "We had
   within a short time given away some thousands of little tracts among
   the common people. And it pleased God hereby to provoke others to
   jealousy. Insomuch that the lord mayor had ordered a large quantity of
   papers, dissuading from cursing and swearing, to be printed and
   distributed to the trainband. And this day An Earnest Appeal to
   Repentance was given at every church door, in or near London, to every
   person who came out; and one left at the house of every householder who
   was absent from church. I doubt not but God gave a blessing therewith."
   Here was an example for the distribution of tracts long before any
   tract society existed either in Great Britain or America; and Mr.
   Wesley continued the practice from that time forward with unexampled
   diligence, furnishing those who were willing to aid him in this good
   method of "sowing the seed of the kingdom" with short and pithy tracts,
   such as "A Word to the Drunkard," "A Word to the Swearer," to the
   "Smuggler," to the "Sabbath-breaker," &c., &c., for gratuitous
   distribution.

   This method, so admirably adapted to bring religious instruction within
   the reach of all classes of men, but more especially the poor, and
   those who have little time and less inclination to read, was afterward
   adopted by Miss Hannah More [sic], by which she contributed much to
   check the progress of infidelity, which about that time threatened to
   deluge the land. Following these examples, others had resorted to the
   same means for diffusing religious truth more effectually among the
   people, both in Europe and America. And, as we have before seen, Bishop
   Asbury had done much by his individual exertions in the same way.

   From a knowledge of the good effects resulting from this practice at
   the time of which we now speak, a combination of effort was made by
   forming the Tract Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which has
   resulted most beneficially to the best interests of mankind. After a
   few years of experiment, the whole concern, by an amicable arrangement,
   was transferred to the book agency, and thenceforward it has been
   conducted as a part and parcel of that establishment.

   The records within my reach do not enable me to notice any particular
   enlargement of the work in the new countries, nor special revivals in
   other places. There was, however, a gradual increase in many places,
   and an extension of the circuits in others, as may be seen by an
   inspection of the numbers in Church fellowship.

   Fifty-two preachers located this year, fourteen were returned
   supernumerary, thirty-eight superannuated, two had been expelled, one
   withdrawn, and five had died.

   Among those who had entered their rest the past year was the Rev. Jesse
   Lee. He was born in Prince George's county, in the state of Virginia,
   in 1758. His parents were respectable, and they gave him that sort of
   education which it was common in those days to bestow on boys not
   destined for any learned profession. In the fifteenth year of his age
   he was happily brought to the knowledge of the truth, and made a
   partaker of the pardoning mercy of God. In the year 1783, one year
   before the organization of our Church, he entered the traveling
   ministry, and continued in it with great zeal and much success till his
   death, which happened on the 12th of August, 1816.

   As the preceding pages of this History have recorded much respecting
   his early labors in the cause of Christ, particularly in New England,
   it is not necessary to recapitulate them in this place. The last
   station he filled was Annapolis, the metropolis of Maryland. While here
   he attended a camp meeting near Hillsborough, on the Eastern Shore of
   Maryland, where he preached twice with great acceptance and power; and
   in the evening of the day on which he preached his last sermon he was
   seized with a chill and fever, from which he never recovered. During
   this time he frequently expressed himself in terms of unshaken
   confidence in his God, and on one occasion shouted aloud, Glory! Glory!
   Glory! Hallelujah! Jesus reigns!"

   On the same evening he spoke for nearly twenty minutes with great
   deliberation, requesting, among other things, that a letter should be
   written to his brother, to let him know that he died happy in the Lord,
   and also that he was fully satisfied with the kind treatment he had
   received from brother Sellers, at whose house he died.

   It seems that there had existed between Jesse Lee and Bishop McKendree
   some difficulty, by which a degree of alienation of affection had taken
   place, much to the grief of their mutual friends. Before, however, the
   former closed his eyes in death, he said to a friend of both, "Give my
   respects to Bishop McKendree, and tell him that I die in love with all
   the preachers; that I love him; and that he lives in my heart." With
   these sentiments of brotherly love in his heart, and a consciousness of
   the peace of God overflowing his soul, this veteran of the cross and
   minister of Christ fell asleep in Jesus, at about half past seven
   o'clock in the evening of the twelfth of September, 1816, aged
   fifty-eight years, having been in the itinerant ministry about
   thirty-three years.

   When Jesse Lee joined the Methodists they were few in number, much
   despised and persecuted, and had therefore to contend with many sorts
   of opposition. Yet in the midst of these things he boldly espoused the
   cause, and early displayed that independence of mind for which he was
   ever afterward characterized. That same love of Christ which was shed
   abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit at his conversion, impelled him
   forward in the path of duty as a minister of Jesus Christ, and enabled
   him to bear up under the various sorts of reproach which were usually
   cast upon Methodist preachers in those days, and to persevere through
   all in the discharge of his high duties as an ambassador of God.

   We do not, indeed, rank him among ministers of the most eminent talents
   as a preacher. His education was limited, his reading confined to a
   small circle of authors, and his mind was left principally to its own
   resources in handling the subjects which came up for investigation. Yet
   his talents were respectable, and his burning zeal in the cause of
   Christ compensated, in some measure at least, for the lack of those
   expanded views which might have been acquired by a more extended and
   critical knowledge of literature and science. But being possessed of
   strong common sense, of a ready wit, and sound understanding, and being
   brought, by his extensive travels, into contact with various classes of
   men, of different views and habits, he treasured up from his daily
   experience and observation much useful knowledge, of which he could
   avail himself in time of need, in defense of the truths he preached,
   and the plans of procedure he had adopted. This also gave him a deep
   insight into the human character, and qualified him to adapt himself
   with admirable facility to the variety of exigencies which arose before
   him.

   His preaching was chiefly of an experimental and practical character;
   and had he not sometimes lowered the dignity of the pulpit by facetious
   sayings, more calculated to "court a grin, or woo a smile," than they
   were to inspire respect "for that holy place, the pulpit," he might be
   more safely held up for the imitation of others. Though we by no means
   condemn an innocent sally of wit, nor that satire which dresses up vice
   and folly in their own native deformity, yet, whenever either of these
   is so far indulged as to leave the mind barren, or to divert the soul
   from the spirit of devotion, it evinces the necessity of laying a
   restraint upon this witty disposition of the mind, and of making it bow
   to the more sober dictates of manly truth and logical argument.

   It has also been objected to Mr. Lee, that he evinced an ambitious
   mind; and his disappointment at not being elected a bishop at the time
   Richard Whatcoat was chosen to that office has been adduced as an
   evidence that he was ambitious of office. That he had reason to expect
   such an appointment must be granted. That Bishop Asbury had designated
   him, at one time, as a proper person for that office, is equally
   manifest. And hence, that he suffered some degree of mortification at
   his non-election, it is reasonable to suppose; and that this might have
   created some uneasiness in his mind, and have biased his judgment and
   feelings toward those who were preferred before him, is not at all
   unlikely. But these things by no means prove the existence of an unholy
   ambition, or an improper thirst for human fame. A man may be very
   improperly deprived of his rights by the unjust imputations of others,
   by intrigue, jealousy, and a mean compliance with the dictates of the
   spirit of rivalry. Without, however, pretending to decide whether or
   not Jesse Lee should have been elected to the office of a bishop, he
   may have thought himself justly entitled to that distinction, and
   hence, from a simple desire to be more extensively useful, he might
   have desired it without subjecting himself to the charge of indulging
   in a criminal ambition. That he was ambitious to do good on the most
   extensive scale is manifest from the whole tenor of his conduct, from
   the sacrifices he made in the cause of Christ, and the manner in which
   he employed his time and talents.

   But whatever defects the keen eye of criticism may have discovered in
   his character or conduct, they must be ranked among those venial faults
   which are common to human beings -- defects of the head, not of the
   heart; of education, and not from moral or intellectual obliquity. The
   integrity of his heart, the uprightness of his deportment, and his
   indefatigable labors in the best of all causes, effectually shield him
   from all imputations of moral delinquency, and place him high on the
   pedestal of honor among his brethren of that age of Methodism.

   He, indeed, opened the way for the introduction of Methodism in many
   new places, in doing which he had to contend with a variety of
   difficulties of a peculiar character; and the firm and prudent manner
   in which he encountered and overcame those difficulties evinced at once
   his moral courage, the purity of his motives, and the strength of his
   understanding. In New England especially, where the people were
   generally well instructed on religious subjects, and where he
   frequently came in contact with ministers of other denominations whose
   doctrinal views differed, in some important points, from his own, he
   was called upon to exercise all his ingenuity and patience in defending
   himself against his assailants, and in planting the standard of
   Methodism in that land of the pilgrims. And this was one of the best
   schools in which a minister could be educated. Coming in collision with
   error in all its various hues, with folly and vice in all the shapes
   they generally assume, whether in open profanity, or of a secret,
   disguised infidelity, hypocrisy, and "cunning craftiness," a minister
   must be armed at all points to be able effectually to ward off the
   attacks of his opponents, to unmask the hypocrite, to detect the
   sophistry of infidelity, and to establish the truth upon a firm
   foundation. Yet this was the work which Jesse Lee, and others engaged
   with him in that day, had to perform. He stood alone against a host. He
   manfully fought the battles of the Lord, and came off "more than a
   conqueror." Hence his name is remembered with gratitude and veneration
   by the men of that generation, who bore witness to his self-denying
   zeal and persevering efforts to do them good.

   His preaching was not distinguished by profound depth of thought, by a
   regular chain of argumentation, or by any sudden flights of oratory,
   but by a gentle flow of language, by apposite appeals to Scripture, by
   apt illustrations from experience and observation, and often by
   anecdotes which he had treasured up from his extensive travels and
   social intercourse with mankind. He generally addressed himself to the
   heart, and sought to effect a reformation there, knowing full well that
   a reformation of life would necessarily follow: and he won the
   affections of the sinner to Jesus Christ by the power of truth
   addressed to him in the persuasive language of the gospel, rather than
   by awakening his fears by the terrors of the law.

   There was an engaging variety in his sermons. Having surveyed, as far
   as he was able, the whole field of theological truth, he was qualified
   to present it in all its various aspects, without tiring the hearer
   with a dull monotony of the same thing over and over again. As a
   writer, Jesse Lee is more distinguished for his industry in collating
   and his fidelity in recording facts, than he is for the chasteness and
   elegance of his style. There is, however, a pleasing simplicity in the
   plain and unvarnished manner in which his history is composed, far more
   to be commended than that labored and pompous style of writing with
   which some authors endeavor to decorate their pages. Jesse Lee was the
   first historian of American Methodism. As such, he deserves the thanks
   of the Church for the faithful and accurate manner in which he has
   recorded the events of his day, though it is evident that his judgment
   was biased, in some instances, either by personal prejudice, or by too
   great a tenacity for his own peculiar views. It must be confessed, too,
   that his history is wanting in the variety of incident and copiousness
   of detail which are essential to excite interest and to satisfy the
   desire of those readers who wish for full information respecting the
   character, doings, and progress of this branch of the church of Christ.

   His personal appearance was respectable and commanding; his countenance
   intelligent, and marked with that shrewdness by which he was peculiarly
   distinguished and often a pleasant smile played upon his lips, which
   gave an air of cheerfulness to his conversation with his friends. As he
   advanced in life he became quite corpulent, so much so that it seemed a
   labor for him either to walk or ride. This, however, did not arise from
   a luxurious mode of living, for he was exceedingly temperate in his
   habits, as well as plain in his manners and dress.

   Such was Jesse Lee, as nearly as I am able to describe him. If the
   portraiture be faulty, it must be attributed to want of skill in the
   painter, and not fidelity in the heart or hand which guided the pencil.
   As such he stands enrolled among those early Methodist preachers who
   contributed by their deep piety, their sacrifices, and labors, to lay
   the foundation of that superstructure which has since arisen in such
   beauty and grandeur in this western world. And having "finished his
   course, and kept the faith," he is now reaping the reward of his
   sacrifices and toils in the world of glory everlasting.

   Samuel Waggoner, Peter Wyatt, John Van Schoick, and Stephen Richmond
   had also filled up the measure of their days in usefulness, and gone to
   their home in peace.

   It seems proper to record here the death of another eminent servant of
   God who had exchanged worlds during the past year, namely, the Rev.
   George Shadford. As he had devoted several years to the service of his
   Master in America, justice requires that some notice should be taken of
   him in the history of our Zion.

   He was born near Lincolnshire, at a place called Slotter, in England,
   January 19,1739. He was educated in the principles of the Established
   Church; was early taught by his parents to read the Holy Scriptures,
   the necessity of prayer, us well as to repeat his catechism; and at a
   suitable age was confirmed by the bishop, and received the sacrament of
   the Lord's supper. Though he was thus taught the form of godliness, he
   remained unchanged in heart until he was in his twenty-fourth year,
   when, after various struggles against sin and error, he was brought
   into gospel liberty by the instrumentality of the Methodist ministry.
   He was soon after led forth into the ministry of the word, and in 1768
   joined the itinerant ministry under the direction of Mr. Wesley. It
   soon appeared, by the blessed effects of his ministrations, that a
   dispensation of the gospel had been committed to him. After continuing
   in this work for about four years, during which time God had given him
   the most indubitable marks of his approbation, hearing Captain Webb
   speak of the state of things in America, and the great want of
   preachers, Mr. Shadford offered his services for this new field of
   labor. His offer being accepted by Mr. Wesley, in company with Mr.
   Thomas Rankin, on Good Friday, he set sail for America, and after a
   voyage of eight weeks safely landed in Philadelphia, where he was most
   cordially received by the people. He immediately entered upon his work,
   and God attended his word with his blessing. He visited Trenton and
   various parts of New Jersey, and then came to New York. In all these
   places God gave him seals to his ministry.

   When he was about leaving the city of Philadelphia the following
   remarkable circumstance happened, which is related in his own words: --

   "When I went," said he, "to the inn where my horse was, and had just
   entered into the yard, I observed a man fixing his eyes upon me, and
   looking earnestly, until he seemed ashamed, and blushed very much. At
   length he came up to me, and abruptly said, Sir, I saw you in a dream
   last night. When I saw your back as you came into the yard I thought it
   was you; but now that I see your face, I am sure that you are the
   person. I have been wandering up and down till now, seeking you.' Saw
   me in a dream,' said I, what do you mean?' Sir,' said he, I did, I am
   sure I did: and yet I never saw you with my bodily eyes before.
   Yesterday in the afternoon I left this city and went as far as
   Schuylkill river, intending to cross it, but began to be uneasy, and
   could not go over it; I therefore returned to this place, and last
   night, in my sleep, saw you stand before me; when a person from another
   world bade me seek for you until I found you, and said you would tell
   me what I must do to be saved. He said also that one particular mark by
   which I might know you was, that you preached in the streets and lanes
   of the city.' Having spoken this, he immediately asked, Pray, sir, are
   not you a minister?' I said, Yes, I am a preacher of the gospel; and it
   is true that I preach in the streets and lanes of the city, which no
   other preacher in Philadelphia does. I preach also every Sunday
   morning, at nine o'clock, in Newmarket.' I then asked him to step
   across the way to a friend's house, where I asked him from whence he
   came. He answered, From the Jerseys.' I asked whether he had any
   family; he said, Yes, a wife and children.' I asked where he was going;
   he said he did not know. I likewise asked, Does your wife know where
   you are?' He said, No; the only reason why I left home was, I had been
   very uneasy and unhappy for half a year past, and could rest no longer,
   but came to Philadelphia."

   "I replied, I first advise you to go back to your wife and children,
   and take care of them, by obeying God in the order of his providence.
   It is unnatural,' said I, to leave them in this manner; for even the
   birds of the air provide for their young. Secondly, you say you are
   unhappy; therefore the thing you want is religion; the love of God, and
   of all mankind; righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. When
   this takes possession of your heart, so as to destroy your evil
   tempers, and root out the love of the world, anger, pride, self-will,
   and unbelief, then you will be happy. The way to obtain this is, you
   must forsake all your sins, and heartily believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ. When you return to the Jerseys, go to hear the Methodist
   preachers constantly, and pray to the Lord to bless the word; and if
   you heartily embrace it you will become a happy man.'

   "While I was exhorting him tears ran plentifully from his eyes. We then
   kneeled down to pray, and I was enabled to plead and intercede with
   much earnestness for his soul. When we arose from our knees I shook him
   by the hand: he wept much, and had a broken heart; but did not know how
   to part with me. He then set out to go to his wife in the Jerseys, and
   I saw him no more; but I trust I shall meet him in heaven."

   Of his subsequent labors in America, and the great success which
   attended his preaching, the reader will find an ample account in the
   first volume of this History, book ii, chapter 1. The following
   incident is related as the effect of his labors while in Virginia.
   Concerning the new converts who were brought to the knowledge of the
   truth during that great and glorious work, Mr. Shadford says: --

   "Among these was a dancing-master, who came first to hear on a
   week-day, dressed in scarlet; and came several miles again on Sunday,
   dressed in green. After preaching he spoke to me, and asked if I could
   come to that part where he lived some day in the week. I told him I
   could not, as I was engaged every day. I saw him again at preaching
   that week, and another man of his profession. When I was going to
   preach one morning, a friend said to me, Mr. Shadford, you spoiled a
   fine dancing-master last week. He was so cut under preaching, and feels
   such a load of sin upon his conscience, that he moves very heavily;
   nay, he cannot shake his heels at all. He had a profitable school, but
   hath given it up, and is determined to dance no more. He intends now to
   teach reading, writing, and arithmetic.' I said, It is very well; what
   is his name?' He said, He is called Madcap!' I said, A very proper name
   for a dancing-master;' but I found this was only a nickname, for his
   real name was Metcalf. He began to teach school, joined our society,
   found the guilt and load of his sin removed from his conscience, and
   the pardoning love of God shed abroad in his heart. He lived six or
   seven years after, and died a great witness for God, having been one of
   the most devoted men in our connection."

   In 1778 Mr. Shadford, not willing to throw off his allegiance to the
   British government, and not being permitted to remain here in peace
   without taking the oath required by the law of the state of Maryland,
   to be an obedient citizen of this country, took his departure for
   England. After his return he continued with great diligence in the work
   of an itinerant minister, being everywhere received as a messenger of
   God, until, worn down with labor and weakened by disease, he was
   compelled, in 1791, to take a supernumerary relation. He did not,
   however, bury himself in obscurity, or lead a life of useless
   inactivity, but persevered in his work as his strength would permit the
   remainder of his days. His biographer gives the following account of
   his last hours, which is an instructive comment upon a life of piety
   and devotion to God: --

   "On Monday, February 28, Mr. Shadford dined with his affectionate
   friend Mr. Blunt, in company with his brethren. He then appeared in
   tolerable health, and ate a hearty dinner. In the course of the week he
   felt indisposed, from a complication of diseases. He was under no
   apprehension at this time that his departure was so near, as he had
   frequently felt similar affections, and, by timely applications to his
   medical friend Mr. Bush, had been relieved. On Friday, March 1, he with
   some difficulty met his class, and afterward said it was impressed on
   his mind he should never meet it more. On the Saturday afternoon I
   called to inquire about his health, when he said, with unusual fervor,

   To patient faith the prize is sure; And all that to the end endure The
   cross, shall wear the crown.'

   His mind seemed fully occupied with the great and interesting realities
   of eternity, and he had no greater pleasure than in meditating and
   talking of the redeeming love of God. On the Lord's day morning, March
   10, before I went to the chapel I called to see him and found he had
   slept most of the night; from this we flattered ourselves the complaint
   had taken a favorable turn, and were in hopes of his recovery. But when
   the doctor called he said the disease was fast approaching to a crisis,
   and it was impossible for him to recover. Upon this information Mr.
   Shadford broke out into a rapture, and exclaimed, Glory be to God!'
   Upon the subject of his acceptance with God, and assurance of eternal
   glory, he had not the shadow of a doubt. While he lay in view of an
   eternal world, and was asked if all was clear before him, he replied, I
   bless God, it is;' and added, Victory! victory! through the blood of
   the Lamb!' When Mrs. Shadford was sitting by him, he repeated, What
   surprise! what surprise!' I suppose he was reflecting upon his
   deliverance from a corruptible body, and his entrance into the presence
   of his God and Saviour, where every scene surpasses all imagination,
   and the boldest fancy returns wearied and unsatisfied in its loftiest
   flights.

   Two friends, who were anxious for his recovery, called upon him, and
   when they inquired how he was, he replied, I am going to my Father's
   house, and find religion to be an angel in death.' A pious lady, in the
   course of the day, was particularly desirous of seeing him, and she
   asked him to pray for her: he inquired, What shall I pray for?' She
   said, That I may meet you in heaven, to cast my blood-bought crown at
   the feet of my Redeemer:' he said, with great energy, The prize is
   sure.' His pious sayings were numerous, and will long live in the
   recollection of many; but a collection of them all would swell this
   article beyond due limits. His last words were, I'll praise, I'll
   praise, I'll praise;' and a little after he fell asleep in Jesus, on
   March 11,1816, in the 78th year of his age."

   The following remarks upon his character are as just as they are true:

   "For nearly fifty-four years Mr. Shadford had enjoyed a sense of the
   divine favor. His conduct and conversation sufficiently evinced the
   truth of his profession. For many years he had professed to enjoy that
   perfect love which excludes all slavish fear; and if Christian tempers
   and a holy walk are proofs of it, his claims were legitimate.
   Maintaining an humble dependence upon the merits of the Redeemer, he
   steered clear of both Pharisaism and Antinomianism: his faith worked by
   love. Truly happy himself, there was nothing forbidding in his
   countenance, sour in his manners, or severe in his observations. His
   company was always agreeable, and his conversation profitable. If there
   was any thing stern in his behavior, it was assumed, to silence
   calumniators and religious gossips. In short, he was a man of prayer,
   and a man of God.

   "His abilities as a preacher were not above mediocrity; yet he was a
   very useful laborer in the vineyard of the Lord. In illustrating the
   doctrines of the gospel he was simple, plain, and clear. His
   discourses, though not labored, were methodical, full of Scriptural
   phraseology, delivered with pathos, and accompanied with the blessing
   of God. He did not perplex his hearers with abstruse reasoning and
   metaphysical distinctions, but aimed to feed them with the bread of
   life; and instead of sending them to a dictionary for an explanation of
   a difficult word, he pointed them to the Lamb of God which taketh away
   the sin of the world.

   "Mr. Shadford was free and generous. His little annual income, managed
   with a strict regard to economy, supplied his wants, and left a portion
   for the poor and needy. In visiting the sick, while he assisted them by
   his prayers and advice, he cheerfully administered to their wants. He
   spent no idle time in needless visits or unmeaning chit-chat; and
   though many of his kind friends in Frome would have considered it a
   high favor if he could have been prevailed upon to partake of their
   bounty, yet he always declined it, except once a week, at the
   hospitable table of his generous friend Mr. Blunt, where he generally
   met the preachers with some part of their families. He loved his
   brethren in the ministry; and, like an old Soldier who had survived
   many a campaign, he felt a plea-sure in retracing the work of God, in
   which he had been engaged for more than half a century. He claimed it
   as a right, and deemed it a privilege, to have the preachers to take
   tea with him every Saturday afternoon. There was nothing sordid in his
   disposition, and, as far as I could ever observe, covetousness formed
   no part of his character. He considered the rule of his Saviour as
   having a peculiar claim upon his attention: Lay up for yourselves
   treasure in heaven.'

   "His patience and resignation to the will of God were such, that he has
   left few superiors in those passive graces. Some years since he lost
   his eyesight, and continued in this state of affliction for several
   years; but instead of murmuring at this dispensation of Providence, he
   bore it with Christian fortitude. This did not altogether prevent his
   usefulness; for though the sphere of his action was circumscribed by
   it, he could still pray with the afflicted, converse with the pious,
   and meet several classes in the week. In this state he was advised to
   submit to an operation for the recovery of his sight. The trial proved
   successful; and when the surgeon said, Sir, now you will have the
   pleasure of seeing to use your knife and fork,' Mr. Shadford feelingly
   replied, Doctor, I shall have a greater pleasure; that of seeing to
   read my Bible.' This luxury he enjoyed; for when he was permitted to
   use his eyesight, the first thing he did was to read the word of life
   for three hours, reading and weeping with inexpressible joy. During the
   whole of his last short illness he betrayed no symptoms of uneasiness,
   but cheerfully submitted to the will of God. Through the last few years
   of his life he glided smoothly down the stream of time. The assiduous
   attention of Mrs. Shadford to all his wants, her sympathy in the
   moments of his pain, and unwearied attempts, either to prevent his
   sufferings or lessen their force, greatly tended to soften them down.
   She has lost a pious and an affectionate husband, and the Methodist
   Society in Frome one of its best members."

   This year marks a favorable epoch in the history of our Church, by the
   recommencement of the Methodist Magazine, the first number of which was
   published by J. Soule and T. Mason, in January, 1818. As has already
   been remarked, the General Conference of 1812 ordered the resumption of
   this work, but the order was never executed. The order was renewed in
   1816, yet from some cause it was not recommenced until this year. Its
   appearance, even at this late period, was hailed, by the friends of
   literature and religion, as the harbinger of brighter days to our Zion,
   as it promised to become a medium of information and instruction to our
   people generally, and a permanent record of those facts and incidents
   which might throw light upon our history in a future day.

   As the issuing of this work was entering on an untrodden path by those
   who were to guide its course and watch over its destinies, it is no
   wonder that its editor, the Rev. Joshua Soule, felt some anxiety for
   its success, and a trembling sense of the responsibilities he was about
   to assume. These he expressed, in the preface to the first number, in
   the following language: --

   "In publishing this periodical, the editors feel all those
   sensibilities which arise from a conviction that its merits are to be
   tested under the inspection of an enlightened community. The care and
   labor inseparable from the agency of the Book Concern forbid our
   devoting as much time and application to the selection and arrangement
   of materials for publication in the Magazine as its nature and
   importance demand. But notwithstanding these embarrassments exist, we
   trust the work will be found both useful and entertaining to the real
   friends of Zion."

   The design of the work, and the manner in which it was proposed to
   carry it into execution, were thus announced: --

   "The great design of this publication is to circulate religious
   knowledge, a design which embraces the highest interests of rational
   existence, as the sum of individual and social happiness increases in a
   scale of proportion with the increase of spiritual light and
   information.

   "In the execution of this design the strictest care will be taken to
   guard the purity and simplicity of the doctrines of the gospel against
   the innovations of superstition on the one hand, and of false
   philosophy on the other.

   "In admitting controversial subjects into this work, the heat of party
   zeal and personal crimination will be carefully avoided."

   As before said, the appearance of this work gave great satisfaction to
   the most enlightened and intelligent friends of our communion, and
   hence a commendable zeal was exemplified in procuring subscribers, that
   it might have as wide a circulation as possible among the people of our
   charge; and I believe that not less than ten thousand were procured the
   first year, though its circulation in subsequent years did not answer
   the expectations raised by this promising commencement.

   An effort was made last year to resuscitate the cause of education
   among us. Dr. Samuel K. Jennings, aided by several benevolent and
   public spirited individuals in the city of Baltimore, laid the
   foundation of a literary institution, denominated the Asbury College;
   and it into operation under apparently favorable auspices, an account
   of which was published in the March number of the Methodist Magazine
   for this year. With this account, however, the friends of education,
   who estimated things as they are, were not much gratified, as it seemed
   to promise more than could be rationally expected, and was rather
   calculated to blazon forth the attainments of the professors than to
   enlighten the public by a sober statement of facts.

   It continued for a short time, and then, greatly to the disappointment
   and mortification of its friends, went down as suddenly as it had come
   up, and Asbury College lives only in the recollection of those who
   rejoiced over its rise and mourned over its fall -- a fatality which
   had hitherto attended all attempts to establish literary institutions
   among us.

   This year was distinguished by some powerful revivals of religion. In
   the city of Baltimore the Rev. Stephen G. Roszel gives an account of
   one of the most extensive and encouraging revivals ever beheld in that
   city. It was preceded by observing days of fasting and prayer, and
   began at Fell's Point, whence it spread throughout the entire city, in
   the progress of which nearly one thousand souls were brought into
   church fellowship. The subjects of this great work were from twelve to
   eighty and even ninety years of age, many of whom were heads of
   families, of respectable standing and influence in society, and others
   in the bloom of life, young men and maidens of promising talents, who
   became pillars in the Church. The work entered the penitentiary, and
   quite a number of the convicts became subjects of the grace of life.
   Such was the impression made upon the public mind by this powerful
   reformation, that even those who were not its immediate subjects were
   awed into silent submission, being constrained to acknowledge the hand
   of God.

   In many other places also, in the bounds of the New York and New
   England conferences, there were gracious outpourings of the Spirit of
   God, and great was the rejoicing of happy believers over the conversion
   of penitent sinners. Southold, on Long Island, and some circuits within
   the bounds of the Kennebec district, in Maine, and other places which
   might be named, were favored with manifestations of the power and grace
   of God in the awakening and conversion of sinners.

   In Upper Canada, particularly on the Augusta, Bay of Quinte, Hallowell,
   and Niagara circuits, there was a great ingathering of souls into the
   fold of Christ, among whom were several Roman Catholics, and eight
   persons who were over sixty years of age.

   This work commenced at an annual conference held at Elizabethtown in
   June, 1817, the first ever held in that province, and thence spread in
   a glorious manner through the above-mentioned circuits, bowing the
   hearts of hundreds, young and old, and in some instances whole
   families, to the yoke of Jesus Christ. During the progress of this
   great work about one thousand souls were brought from darkness to
   light, and added to the Church.

   We have heretofore seen that camp meetings, by reason of the
   irregularities which brought them into discredit, gradually declined in
   Kentucky, and were indeed generally abandoned for several years,
   especially in the central part of the state. Their usefulness, however,
   in other parts of the country, induced some of the friends of the cause
   to make an effort to introduce them again into the interior of
   Kentucky. The Rev. Le Roy Cole, who joined the traveling ministry as
   early as 1777, had located and moved into Clarke county, Ky.; but,
   being much devoted to the work of God, he had entered the itinerancy,
   and was again zealously engaged in promoting revivals. This year he
   appointed a camp meeting in the neighborhood of Cynthiana, in Harrison
   county. For the first and second days every thing tended to discourage
   them -- the rain descended in torrents, and a company of rude young men
   came on the ground, with bottles of whisky in their pockets, evidently
   determined on mischief. The friends of religion, however, persevered in
   their work, and on Saturday night there was a mighty display of the
   convincing power of God. Those very young men, who came for sport,
   became much alarmed; some, throwing away their whisky bottles, fell
   upon their knees in prayer, while others ran into the woods, to escape,
   if possible, from their fears; but even here their cries for mercy
   testified to the deep anguish of their souls. This was the commencement
   of a great revival of religion in that part of the country, which
   eventuated in the conversion of about four hundred souls in Cynthiana
   and its vicinity, under the ministry of Absalom Hunt, Le Roy Cole, and
   others, who assisted them in their work. From this the reformation
   afterward spread its hallowing influence in various directions through
   the country, and camp-meetings regained their lost character in that
   part of Kentucky. It is, indeed, said, that during this great and good
   work several traveling preachers were raised up, who have since
   distinguished themselves for usefulness in the Church.

   The general superintendency of the Church, as has been seen in the
   account given of the General Conference of 1816, was now committed to
   three hands, all of whom entered upon their work with commendable zeal
   and diligence, traveling through the length and breadth of their
   charge, alternately changing with each other, so that each could pass
   through his great circuit at least once in four years. Bishop
   McKendree, however, enjoyed but a feeble state of health, and could
   not, therefore, render that efficient service which was desirable. But
   his colleagues were comparatively young and vigorous, their labors
   incessant, and their services highly appreciated by the Church
   generally.

   Of the living it would be unseemly to speak in terms of fulsome
   flattery, while of the dead they may be told without the fear of
   censure for either praise or dispraise. Of Bishop McKendree we have
   already spoken, while giving an account of his election to office.
   Bishop George was a man singularly devoted to God, of great natural
   eloquence, and his preaching was "in the demonstration of the Spirit
   and power;" and wherever he went he diffused the spirit of piety and of
   Christian and ministerial zeal among preachers and people. And it is
   enough to say that his colleague, Bishop Roberts, gave equal evidence
   of his strong attachment to the cause he had espoused, and general
   satisfaction to his brethren by the manner in which he discharged his
   duties. In the hands of such men the government was administered with
   fidelity, the conferences attended with punctuality, and the union,
   peace, and prosperity of the Church generally secured and promoted.

   But though the health of Bishop McKendree was delicate, he was enabled
   to move around among the churches, and to discharge a portion of the
   duties of the superintendency. This year he traveled through the
   southern and western states, extending his visits to Ohio, Illinois,
   Indiana, Mississippi, and Missouri, in which he passed through several
   tribes of Indians. Though his bodily infirmities were such that his
   friends had to assist him in mounting and dismounting his horse, yet
   his zeal for God and perishing souls impelled him forward, and enabled
   him to triumph over all the difficulties of his journey, and to
   perform, with such assistance as he could procure, the duties of his
   office. Such, however, was his feebleness when he came to the Tennessee
   conference, that he had to be taken from his bed and supported by two
   preachers while he performed the ordination services, which he did on
   the camp ground where the exercises were held on the sabbath. The rest
   of his journey was pursued in a like state of feebleness and pain, and
   his sufferings were heightened by his being obliged to lodge in the
   woods eight or ten nights while passing through the Choctaw and
   Chickasaw nations of Indians. In these labors he was borne up by a
   consciousness of the divine approbation, and cheered by the good
   countenance and affectionate attentions of his brethren and friends.

   Fifty were located, seventeen returned supernumerary, thirty-eight
   superannuated, and five, namely, William Patridge, Anthony Senter,
   Henry Padgett, Hezekiah Harryman, and Gad Smith, had died in peace. A
   strong testimony in favor of all these is left on record; but the last
   mentioned, Gad Smith, was one of the most devoted, diligence, and
   useful young ministers I ever knew. His race was short, but it was
   attended with most evident marks of the divine favor.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This Year: 190,447; Last Year: 181,442;
   Increase: 9,035 -- Colored This Year: 39,150; Last Year: 43,411;
   Decrease: 4,261 -- Total This Year: 229,627; Last Year: 224,853 --
   Increase: 4,774 -- Preachers This Year: 748; Last Year: 716; Increase:
   32.

   The reader will perceive that while there was an increase of white
   members amounting to 9,035, there was a decrease of 4,261 of the
   colored members, reducing the actual increase to 4,774.

   This diminution in the number of colored communicants was owing to the
   influence of the Allenite secession, before mentioned, which had now
   spread into the city of New York and some other places, exciting quite
   a spirit of dissatisfaction in the minds of many of this class of our
   membership. Indeed, a desire to become independent of the white
   preachers had manifested itself for some time among a portion of our
   colored congregations, not because they were oppressed, -- for our
   services had been rendered mostly gratuitous, the entire colored
   congregation in the city of New York not paying more, at any time, than
   two hundred dollars a year for the support of the ministry, -- but
   chiefly from a disposition to manage their own affairs in their own
   way, without check or control from their white brethren, pleading that
   they had piety and talent among themselves sufficient to guide them in
   their counsels, to supply their pulpits, and to exercise the discipline
   of the Church. It is not known, however, that they departed in any
   degree from the, doctrines which they had received, or from the General
   Rules of the United Societies. In this respect, therefore, they
   remained Methodists still, while they declared themselves independent
   in regard to a general control over their societies and church
   property.

  1819

   This year was distinguished for the origin and commencement of the
   Missionary society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

   It is true that Methodism had been justly considered missionary in its
   character from its beginning. Among all modern missionaries, John
   Wesley was the greatest, the most evangelical, laborious, and
   successful. The method which he adopted and pursued to the end of his
   most useful life included in it all the elements of a missionary
   society, missionary plans, and operations. And the manner in which our
   Church was organized in this country partook of the like missionary
   character. The first Wesleyan ministers who came to this country were
   missionaries, in the proper sense of that word; and it was by carrying
   out the spirit and plans which they adopted, itinerating as extensively
   as possible through the country, that the gospel took such a rapid
   spread through the instrumentality of their successors.

   Yet, on the increase of our work, bringing the circuits, districts, and
   conferences into a more regular and compact order, it was found that it
   was losing somewhat of its missionary character, and therefore needed,
   that it might take a still wider range of usefulness, something by
   which a more expansive field of labor might be occupied. This could be
   done only by grafting upon the original stock the branch of a
   missionary society, subject to such regulations as should bring it
   strictly within the control of the general superintendency.

   It was found also that there were many parts of our country, both in
   the old and new settlements, where the people were either too poor or
   too indifferent about their eternal interests to grant any thing like a
   competent support to those who might be sent to preach the gospel to
   them. With these difficulties we had long contended, and many of our
   preachers had suffered all sorts of hardships in conveying to the
   people in these circumstances the glad tidings of salvation. But as
   they had succeeded in raising up societies, many of which had become
   comparatively wealthy, it was thought to be nothing more than a duty
   which the Church owed to God and to mankind, that its members should
   contribute a portion of their earthly substance to aid in supplying the
   spiritual wants of those destitute places. Under these impressions it
   was concluded that if a united and systematic plan could be devised to
   call forth the ability and liberality of the Church, that amount of
   human suffering arising from pecuniary embarrassments might be greatly
   diminished, the gospel be more extensively spread among the poor and
   the destitute, and those men of God who were willing to devote their
   energies to this noble enterprise be relieved from the anxieties
   arising from present or prospective want and suffering. These thoughts
   had long occupied the minds of some of the most enlightened and
   warm-hearted ministers and members of our Church.

   This subject accordingly became the topic of conversation among several
   individuals in the city of New York in the beginning of this year, some
   for and some against the measure. At length, at a meeting of preacher's
   stationed in New York, and the book agents, the Rev. Laban Clark
   presented a resolution in favor of forming a Bible and missionary
   society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. At this time the following
   preachers were present, namely, Freeborn Garrettson, Joshua Soule,
   Samuel Merwin, Nathan Bangs, Laban Clark, Thomas Mason, Seth Crowell,
   Samuel Howe, and Thomas Thorp. After a free interchange of thoughts on
   the subject the resolution was adopted, and Freeborn Garrettson, Laban
   Clark, and Nathan Bangs were appointed a committee to prepare a
   constitution to be submitted at a subsequent meeting of the
   above-mentioned preachers. This committee, on coming together, agreed
   that each member should draft a constitution, and at a subsequent
   meeting the one should be adopted which might appear the most suitable.
   On comparing these drafts, the one prepared by the present writer was
   preferred, and at a full meeting of the preachers before mentioned,
   after undergoing some verbal alterations, was unanimously concurred in,
   and ordered to be submitted to a public meeting of all the members and
   friends of the Church who might choose to attend the call, in the
   Forsyth Street church, on the evening of April 5, 1819. This was
   accordingly done, when Nathan Bangs was called to the chair. Addresses
   were delivered by the Chair, by Freeborn Garrettson, Joshua Soule, and
   some others, when, on motion of Joshua Soule, seconded by Freeborn
   Garrettson, the constitution which had been prepared was adopted. It is
   as follows: --

  CONSTITUTION

   application of its funds for the accomplishment of the objects herein
   expressed, and for the purpose of depositing its funds with the agents
   of the Book Concern, and of having their aid in printing, purchasing,

   revenue of the society shall never be used or appropriated otherwise
   than for the printing, purchasing, and distributing Bibles and
   Testaments under the direction of the managers; and for the support of
   missionaries who may act under the direction of the bishops and
   conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

   Article XIV. This constitution, being submitted and approved according
   to the provisions of the preceding article, shall not be altered but by

   Having thus formed the society, and created a board of officers and
   managers, the next question was, how we might best enlist the feelings
   and engage the co-operation of our brethren and friends generally in
   this important cause. To do this the more effectually, at the first
   meeting of the managers the following address and circular, prepared by
   the author, who had been appointed for that purpose, were adopted, and
   ordered to be printed and circulated, both in pamphlet form and in the
   Methodist Magazine.

  ADDRESS

    Of the Missionary and Bible Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in
    America

   At a time when the Christian world is alive to every sentiment of
   humanity, and awake to the temporal and spiritual wants of men, every
   effort directed to the accomplishment of the grand climax of human
   felicity will, by the philanthropic mind, be viewed with pleasure and
   delight.

   "It is the peculiar office of Christianity to inspire in the breasts of
   its votaries an ardent desire for the happiness of man. Expanding the
   soul with the purest benevolence, wherever its influence is felt it
   expels that selfishness which is fed and strengthened by avarice. And
   this divine principle, occupying the heart, prompts its possessor to
   the selection of the most suitable means to accomplish the object of
   his desire. Ever active, and directing his activity to exalt the glory
   of God, and to effect the present and future happiness of man, whenever
   suitable means are presented they are applied with assiduity, and with
   certain hope of success.

   "Such, we trust, are the objects of the patrons of this society.
   Beholding with pleasure the extensive diffusion of Scriptural
   knowledge, through the medium of missionary, Bible, and tract
   societies, and believing that more efficient means to extend the
   Redeemer's kingdom were within their power, the members of the
   Missionary and Bible Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in
   America have agreed to unite their strength for the purpose of
   contributing their mite toward sending the messengers of peace to
   gather in the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

   "In presenting their institution to their brethren and to the Christian
   public, they deem it expedient to explain, in a few words, their
   ultimate design: -- it is, as expressed in the first article of the
   constitution, To enable the several annual conferences more effectually
   to extend their missionary labors throughout the United States and
   elsewhere; to afford a cheap supply of Bibles and Testaments to those
   who may have the means of purchasing; and to supply the destitute
   gratis.

   "The primary intention, therefore, of this institution is an extended
   operation of the great missionary system, the success of which has been
   witnessed among us for so many years; and the Bible is only so far
   associated with it as to be made subservient to the main design. That
   this ought to be the leading design of every association which has for
   its final object the diffusion of Christianity, will appear evident to
   those who consider, that it has been the invariable method of God to
   bring mankind to the knowledge of the truth by means of a living
   ministry. The Bible is the infallible judge to which the living
   messenger appeals for the correctness of his message; but it is the
   word of truth, addressed by the ambassador of Christ to the
   understandings and consciences of men, that generally lays open the
   nakedness of the human heart, and brings the guilty sinner to Jesus
   Christ. Send, therefore, the living messenger of God, with the Bible in
   his hands, and let that finally decide the controversy between the
   sinner and the truths delivered. This method, we believe, will be the
   most effectual to convey the glad tidings of salvation to those who are
   perishing for lack of knowledge.

   Moreover, as it is the design of this society to extend itself, if
   possible, by means of auxiliary societies, throughout the United
   States, and to engage especially the co-operation of all the annual
   conferences, provision is made in the constitution for the formation of
   auxiliary societies, and a circular addressed to them on the subject;
   and as none are so competent to take an impartial and comprehensive
   view of the various parts of our extensive continent as the General
   Conference, in which is concentrated the episcopal authority and the
   general oversight of the whole Church; and as it would, in our opinion,
   very much facilitate the operations, and greatly contribute to
   accomplish the benevolent objects of the society, to unite in some
   measure its counsels and operations with the book agency; we have
   provided for the attainment of these objects, by ceding to the General
   Conference a power of inserting such articles for these purposes as
   they may judge proper, as well as for the equitable apportionment of
   the funds of the society among the several annual conferences. As our
   ultimate object is the general good of mankind, by the extensive
   diffusion of experimental and practice godliness, we are principally
   solicitous to raise an adequate supply for such men of God as may
   volunteer their services in the cause of Christ, leaving to the
   episcopacy the selection of the men, as well as the place of their
   destination. We take the liberty of observing, however, that our views
   are not restricted to our own nation or color; we hope the aborigines
   of our country, the Spaniards of South America, the French of Louisiana
   and Canada, and every other people who are destitute of the invaluable
   blessings of the gospel, as far as our means may admit, will be
   comprehended in the field of the labors of our zealous missionaries. To
   accomplish so great and so glorious an object, time, union, liberality,
   patience, and perseverance are all necessary. And we hope to exhibit,
   in our future exertions, evidence of our zeal in providing pecuniary
   aid to the extent of our power, and in our fervent prayers and earnest
   wishes for the success of our institution.

   "With an object of such magnitude and importance before us, we think we
   cannot appeal in vain to the liberality of our brethren and friends for
   their hearty cooperation.

   "When we review our ministry from the commencement of our existence as
   a separate communion, and mark its successful progress, we are
   constrained to say, What hath God wrought!

   "Contending with numerous impediments, they have persevered with great
   success in extending the triumphs of the cross among mankind. We
   ourselves are, we humbly trust, the trophies of this ministry. By the
   blessing of God upon their labors, it was this same ministry, crossing
   the watery world' in the character of missionaries, that gave the first
   impetus to that mighty exertion in the Christian cause, by which the
   present generation in this western world is distinguished. And shall we
   be wanting in our efforts to send this gospel of the kingdom' to our
   fellow-men, millions of whom are yet dwelling in darkness and in the
   shadow of death?

   "Arise, brethren, in the majesty of your strength: in the name of
   Immanuel, God with us, go forward: concentrate your force in this
   society; and, by a united exertion, help to people the regions of
   perennial happiness, by contributing to send the word of life to the
   destitute inhabitants of our fallen world. What heart can remain
   unmoved, what hand unemployed, when called to action in a cause so
   important, so interesting, so sacred! Let but the friends of Zion give
   half as much for the support of missionaries, and for the distribution
   of the word of life, as the intemperate do to gratify and pamper their
   appetites, and there shall be no lack. "Although the constitution which
   accompanies this address requires the payment of two dollars annually
   to constitute a member, and the payment of twenty dollars at one time
   to constitute a member for life, yet this does not exclude donations to
   any amount, great or small. Remember, the mite of the poor widow was
   not only accepted, but her liberality was highly applauded by her Lord,
   because she put in all her living. It is accepted according to what a
   man hath, and not according to what he hath not.' And if every one will
   become a cheerful giver, according to the ability which God giveth,' we
   shall soon witness the rising glory of the Church; the solitary places
   shall be glad for them' -- the messengers of Zion -- and the wilderness
   shall blossom as the rose;' the pagan nations, which inhabit the wilds
   of America, and the desolate inhabitants of our new states and
   territories, shall hail the effects of your bounty; -- nations unborn
   shall rise up and call you blessed. Let, then, all hearts be warm, and
   all hands active, until the ends of the earth see the salvation of our
   God.'"

  CIRCULAR

   "The managers of the Missionary and Bible Society of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church in America beg leave to present to the several annual
   conferences, and through them to the members of our Church generally, a
   copy of their address and constitution, with an earnest solicitation
   that efficient means may be adopted to establish societies auxiliary to
   this.

   "Having long been convinced of the necessity of some institution, by
   which pecuniary aid could be afforded to enable the conferences to
   carry on their missionary labors on a more extended plan, the object of
   their desire is at length so far accomplished in the formation of this
   society, the real and professed object of which is, to extend the
   influence of divine truth, by means of those missionaries who may, from
   time to time, be approved and employed by the bishops and conferences
   for that purpose.

   "You are referred to the preceding address for more particular
   information of our views, and the reasons for some of the articles of
   the constitution. Any amendments which may be suggested by either of
   the annual conferences can be forwarded to the managers, and, if deemed
   expedient, the General Conference, agreeably to the provisions of the
   last article of the constitution, can adopt them.

   "You are likewise presented with the draught of a constitution deemed
   suitable for auxiliary societies, leaving it to you to make such
   alterations as local circumstances may seem to require. This is done
   with a view to produce as much uniformity in the operations of the
   various auxiliaries as circumstances will admit.

   "The managers beg leave to suggest the propriety of forming one society
   only auxiliary to this, in each conference, to be located in the most
   populous town or city within the bounds of the conference, such as
   Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, Boston, &c., &c., and that the
   other societies which may be formed within the limits of each
   conference become branches of that. This method, it is thought, will
   greatly facilitate the operations of the society, and produce greater
   energy in the execution of its benevolent designs, than it would to
   make every subordinate society immediately auxiliary to the parent
   society. And if the several annual conferences unite their counsels,
   and recommend the subject to the people of their charge, with practical
   zeal and energy, it is believed that auxiliary and branch societies may
   be established in every City and circuit throughout our extensive work.

   "According to a recent report of the General Wesleyan Methodist
   Missionary Society,' now in successful operation in England, our
   brethren in Europe, during the last year, have raised upward of eighty
   thousand dollars for the support of domestic and foreign missionaries!
   Through this generous pecuniary aid they now employ one hundred and
   three missionaries. How much, therefore, may we do, if efficient means
   are used to combine our strength!

   "The object contemplated by this society, the managers think, is of
   sufficient importance and utility to recommend itself to every
   considerate and pious mind; and therefore they need say no more, than
   to add their prayers, and request yours, that we may all be guided by
   the wisdom that cometh from above in all our attempts to promote peace
   on earth and good-will among men.

   "Signed by order of the board of managers, N. Bangs, Chairman. New
   York, April 21, 1819.

   "P.S. As soon as any auxiliary society is formed, it is requested that
   official notice thereof be forwarded to our corresponding secretary,
   Rev. Thomas Mason, No. 41 John Street, New York."

   Soon after the society was thus organized, our plans and proceedings
   were submitted to the Baltimore conference by the Rev. Joshua Soule;
   and it was no small encouragement to be assured that the brethren of
   that conference most heartily approved of our objects, and passed
   spirited resolutions to carry our plans into effect. The Virginia, New
   York, and New England conferences passed similar resolutions,
   recommending the society to the patronage and support of the people of
   their charge.

   The first auxiliary society was the Female Missionary Society of New
   York, which was organized in July, 1819. Then followed the Young Men's
   of New York, Courtlandt, Stamford, Genesee conference, the Domestic
   Missionary Society of Boston, and Columbia, of South Carolina, all
   which became auxiliary in the course of the year. These movements were
   sources of much comfort, and greatly encouraged the officers and
   managers to persevere in the work they had so happily begun.

   Soon after our organization a letter was addressed, by order of the
   managers, to Bishop McKendree, stating to him the plan and objects of
   the society, and requesting his opinion respecting the practicability
   and the most suitable means of sending the gospel to the French of
   Louisiana, and to the destitute inhabitants of Florida. The following
   is an extract from the bishop's answer

   "Your plan meets my views of preaching the gospel to every creature
   better than any one I have yet seen.
    1. Because that body of missionaries whom you intend to employ have
       mutually agreed to renounce ease and worldly interest, and devote
       their time, their talents, and their labors. They know no
       geographical boundaries; but, like the gospel which they preach,
       embrace the poor as well as the rich of every nation and condition
       of men; and in order to perpetuate the blessings of the gospel to
       all classes of men, they voluntarily subject themselves to a system
       of rules and regulations calculated to promote so desirable an end,
       and labor for the reformation and happiness of mankind, which is
       the ultimate design of the gospel.
    2. It promises that pecuniary aid, for want of which we have had the
       mortification of seeing many well-devised plans frustrated, and
       many hopeful prospects fade away.

   "You are sufficiently acquainted with the state of things in Canada,
   Florida, the state of Louisiana, and the Missouri territory form our
   western frontiers, and furnish a large field for missionary enterprise.
   In these bounds there are many French, some of them friendly to our
   views of religion. Believing that it would be productive of much good,
   we have long wished for, and frequently endeavored to procure,
   ministers who would be itinerant ministers indeed, to send to our
   western frontiers to preach to their inhabitants in French; but we have
   been hitherto disappointed."

   About the same time that this society was established in the city of
   New York, the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church
   within the bounds of the Philadelphia conference was formed; and though
   it has never thought it best to become auxiliary, it has pursued the
   even tenor of its way from that time to this, appropriating its funds
   for the promotion of the same benevolent objects, and has done much in
   furtherance of the cause of missions.

   While these efforts were making to enlarge the sphere of our operations
   by means of missionary institutions and labors, the work in general, on
   the circuits and stations, was in a state of prosperity, as may be seen
   by reference to the number of Church members. In the Scioto and Ohio
   districts, in Chillicothe, Ohio, and in Schenectady, New York, and some
   other places, there were encouraging revivals of religion. There was,
   however, a very considerable secession among the colored people in the
   city of New York.

   We have already seen that the secession of Allen and his party created
   much uneasiness in the minds of the colored members of our Church, both
   in Philadelphia and New York, and that quite a number, particularly in
   the other city, were induced to join the disaffected party. Allen had
   succeeded also in establishing a small congregation in the city of New
   York, over which he had ordained a preacher by the name of Miller, [4]
   who had been for several years a local preacher in our Church.

   There were in this city, altogether; about one thousand colored people
   attached to our Church, among whom were several local preachers of
   piety and talent. These had heretofore been under the pastoral
   oversight of a white elder, stationed by the bishop, who administered
   to them the ordinances, exercised discipline, held love-feasts, and
   generally preached to them once every sabbath-the other appointments
   being filled by their own local preachers. For this service the
   trustees of the white churches thought it no more than just that the
   colored congregation should pay something toward the support of the
   preacher who had charge of them. This became one source of complaint,
   while others thought it was degrading to them to be in any way
   dependent upon white men for the administration of the ordinances and
   the government of the Church. Accordingly symptoms of dissatisfaction
   had shown themselves for several years on these and collateral
   subjects; and though various attempts had been made to remove their
   grounds of complaint, they had proved unavailing; this year, therefore,
   they declared themselves independent.

   They did not, however, connect themselves with the Allenites. As they
   had succeeded in building them a commodious house of worship in Church
   Street, had several local preachers and some elders among themselves,
   and not having full confidence in Allen and his partisans, they saw fit
   to organize themselves into an independent body, called the African
   Methodist Episcopal Church, under the government of elders of their own
   choosing, altering our Discipline so far as to make it conform to their
   peculiar organization, electing annually one of their elders as a
   general superintendent, without, however, setting him apart to that
   office by prayer and imposition of hands. With these exceptions, it is
   believed that they retain the doctrines and discipline of the Church
   they have left, having their annual and quarterly conferences, class
   meeting, love-feasts, and sacramental services, as provided for in our
   Discipline.

   One principal reason assigned by themselves for this separate
   organization was, that colored preachers were not recognized by our
   conferences as traveling preachers; and, therefore, however much a
   local preacher might labor in word and doctrine for the benefit of his
   colored brethren, he could neither exercise the functions of pastor in
   the governmental department, nor receive a pecuniary support for his
   services. To remedy this inconvenience, and remove the disability under
   which they labored in this respect, they withdrew from our pastoral
   oversight, established a conference of their own, and commenced the
   itinerant mode of preaching the gospel.

   By this secession we lost fourteen colored local preachers, and nine
   hundred and twenty-nine private members, including class leaders,
   exhorters, and stewards. But though they thus "went out from us," they
   have never, I believe, manifested any rancorous or bitter spirit toward
   their old friends, but have cultivated a feeling of friendship and
   brotherly affection; and there is reason to believe that, though they
   may not have prospered in the same ratio in which they did before their
   separation, they have retained their piety and zeal, and have managed
   their affairs in an orderly manner.

   It is now (1839) twenty years since the secession took place, and the
   degree of their prosperity may be estimated from the following
   statement of their number of circuits and stations, preachers and
   members, taken from their minutes for 1839.

   Circuits 21; preachers 32; members 2,608. These circuits and stations
   are found in the states of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode
   Island, and Massachusetts. In the City of New York, where the secession
   originated, they have a membership of 1,325, making an increase of 396
   in twenty years, which is by no means in a ratio with their increase
   while they remained under the care of their white brethren. In the city
   of Boston, however, their success has been greater in proportion. In
   1819 they had only 33; but now, in 1839, they have 126.

   They will not allow any slaveholder to become or remain a member of
   their church.

   As the Methodist Episcopal Church never derived any temporal emolument
   from them, so we have sustained no other damage by the secession than
   what may arise from missing the opportunity of doing them all the good
   in our power as their pastors. And if a desire for independence on
   their part has deprived us of this opportunity, having done what we
   could as Christian ministers to prevent the rupture, I trust we shall
   be absolved from all blame, be the consequences what they may. We
   cannot do otherwise than wish them all spiritual and temporal blessings
   in Christ Jesus. Though formally separated from us in name, we still
   love them as our spiritual children, and stand ready to aid them, as
   far as we may, in extending the Redeemer's kingdom among men.

   Forty-seven preachers located this year, fifteen were returned
   supernumerary, thirty-six superannuated, two were expelled, and nine
   had finished their work and gone to their reward. These latter were,
   Fletcher Harris, Thomas Lucas, Joseph Stone, John Wesley Bond, Joseph
   Totten, Daniel Moore, Thomas Thorp, Stephen Jacob, Jason Walker.

   Joseph Totten had long been a faithful laborer in his Lord's vineyard,
   having entered the traveling ministry in 1792, and continued steadfast
   in his work until death signed his release.

   Thomas Thorp was young in the ministry, but was a man of precocious
   genius, possessing a remarkable aptitude for the acquirement of
   knowledge, and for imparting it to others.

   John Wesley Bond was for several years the traveling companion of
   Bishop Asbury during the close of his days, and attended him with the
   fidelity and affection of a son, was with him in his last sickness and
   death, watching his parting breath, while the bishop leaned his dying
   head upon his arm. Of his excellent spirit, his integrity, and faithful
   services, particularly toward him as his traveling companion, Bishop
   Asbury bears an ample testimony. He ended his days in peace and
   triumph.

   The others enumerated were faithful in their calling and happy in their
   death.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This Year:201,750; Last Year: 190,477;
   Increase: 11,273 -- Colored This Year: 39,174; Last Year: 39,150;
   Increase: 24 -- Total This Year: 240,924; Last Year: 229,627 --
   Increase: 11,297 -- Preachers This Year: 812; Last Year: 748; Increase:
   64.

   The secession of the colored people in the city of New York, amounting
   to about nine hundred, accounts for the small increase of that class to
   the membership; while the general increase shows the happy results of
   the work among the white population.

  1820

   Previously to the session of the General Conference, May 1 of this
   year, the Ohio, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina,
   Virginia, Baltimore, and Philadelphia Conferences held their sessions
   and elected their delegates -- the New York, New England, and Genesee
   conferences, having held theirs after the session of the General
   Conference, elected their delegates the year before.

   The reports from various parts of the work this year were highly
   favorable, the increase to the membership being nearly twenty thousand.
   The establishment of the Tract and Missionary Societies, and the
   publication of the Methodist Magazine, added a fresh stimulant to
   preachers and people, and tended much to enlarge the field of labor, as
   well as to encourage the hearts of those who were panting for the
   salvation of the world.

   But, before giving a detailed account of these things, we shall notice
   the doings of the General Conference.

   Bishops McKendree, George, and Roberts were present, and the conference
   was opened by Bishop McKendree by reading a portion of the word of God,
   singing, and prayer; and he then informed the conference that, in
   consequence of ill health, he should not he able to discharge the
   duties of the chair, but should avail himself of every opportunity
   which his health might permit to assist his colleagues in guiding the
   counsels of the conference. I regret that I am not able to find a copy
   of the written address which he afterward presented, containing
   recommendations of such subjects as he considered worthy the attention
   of the conference. From the character and duties of the committees,
   however, it appears that the address referred to the state of the
   episcopacy, -- the local preachers, -- to the instruction of children
   -- to the condition of the slaves, -- to the cause of missions -- to
   the use of spirituous liquors, -- to the condition of our houses of
   worship, and to the boundaries of the annual conferences -- all which
   were referred to appropriate committees.

   Bishops George and Roberts, in a verbal communication, called the
   attention of the conference to the state of things in Canada, and to
   the subject of locating traveling preachers without their consent,
   which were referred to committees.

   The following is an extract from the report of the committee on the
   episcopacy: --

   After approving of the manner in which the bishops had discharged their
   onerous duties during the past four years, the committee add --

   "In relation to strengthening the episcopacy, they have regarded with
   deep and affectionate concern the declining health and strength of our
   senior superintendent. Worn down by long, extensive, and faithful
   labors in the service of God and the Church, your committee feel a
   solicitude, which they doubt not is equally felt by the conference,
   that every practicable provision may be made for his relief and
   comfort, hoping that by a prudent relaxation from labor for a time, the
   Church may yet be blessed with the benefit of his very desirable
   services and counsel."

   Whereupon the following resolutions were submitted by the committee and
   concurred in by the conference: --
    1. That it is the wish and desire of this General Conference that
       Bishop McKendree, during his afflictions and debility, should
       travel in such directions, or remain in such places, as he may
       judge most conducive to his own health and comfort, and that he be
       accordingly, at the close of the conference, respectfully and
       affectionately requested so to do.
    2. That, whenever Bishop McKendree shall think himself able, it is the
       desire of this conference that he should continue, so far as his
       health will permit, the exercise of his episcopal functions and
       superintending care.
    3. That the committee appointed by the last General Conference, to
       make provision for the families of the bishops, are hereby
       continued, and that the same committee be directed to take into
       consideration the present state of Bishop McKendree's health, and
       to provide for defraying any extra expenses which, in their
       judgment, his afflictions may make requisite."

   This affectionate regard of the conference for the bishop was a source
   of great consolation to him, and counterbalanced, in some measure at
   least, the mental anxieties he suffered at this conference, in
   consequence of the conflicting opinions respecting the manner in which
   the presiding elders should be appointed, and in what their duties
   should consist. But as all these things, together with the election and
   resignation of another bishop, have been fully detailed in vol. ii,
   page 330 [separate pages not transcribed into the electronic text --
   DVM], I shall add nothing more in reference to them here, only to say,
   that Bishop McKendree expressed his high gratification for the respect
   and sympathy thus manifested toward him by the conference in his
   afflictions, and for the confidence reposed in the integrity with which
   he had administered the government of the Church.

   We have before remarked that the cause of education had been abandoned
   by our Church since the destruction of Cokesbury College the second
   time by fire, and that the consequences of this long neglect of so
   important a cause began to bear injuriously upon the character and
   prosperity of the Church. This had been painfully felt and feelingly
   expressed by some of the most enlightened members of our Church, both
   ministers and people, and some incipient steps had been taken by the
   New England and New York conferences to remedy the evil. In 1817 an
   academy had been established in Newmarket, N.H., under the patronage of
   the New England conference, and another in the city of New York in
   1819, under the patronage of the New York conference. Wishing to secure
   also the patronage of the General Conference, as far as might be
   consistent, and likewise to awaken a spirit favorable to the cause of
   education generally, the friends of these institutions presented to
   this General Conference their respective constitutions and plans of
   procedure, praying that the bishops might be authorized to appoint
   principals from among the traveling preachers for a longer space than
   two years. This authority was granted, and the whole subject was
   referred to a committee, the report of which, in the following words,
   was adopted by the conference: --

   "The committee appointed to take into consideration the propriety of
   recommending to the annual conferences the establishment of seminaries
   of learning, having had the subject under deliberation, beg leave to
   submit the following report: --

   "Your committee regret the want of time, as well as talent, to take
   that extended and comprehensive view of the subject which its
   importance demands; but it is cause of greater regret still,
   considering the rapid improvement of society in almost every science,
   and the extension of our Church through the propagation of those divine
   principles which we consider so unspeakably precious, that this subject
   has not sooner claimed the attention of the General Conference.

   "Almost all seminaries of learning in our country, of much celebrity,
   are under the control of Calvinistic or of Hopkinsian principles, or
   otherwise are managed by men denying the fundamental doctrines of the
   gospel. If any of our people, therefore, wish to give their sons or
   daughters a finished education, they are under the necessity of
   resigning them to the management of those institutions which are more
   or less hostile to our views of the grand doctrines of Christianity.

   "Another capital defect in most seminaries of learning, your committee
   presume to think, is, that experimental and practical godliness is
   considered only of secondary importance; whereas, in the opinion of
   your committee, this ought to form the most prominent feature in every
   literary institution. Religion and learning should mutually assist each
   other, and thus connect the happiness of both worlds together.

   "On account, however, of the different usages which prevail in the
   several sections of our widely extended country, originating from state
   regulations, &c., your committee think it impossible for the General
   Conference to adopt a system of regulations on this subject uniformly
   the same for each annual conference. But that each conference should
   exert itself to adopt some method for such advantages to the rising
   generation as may be had from literary institutions which combine
   religion and learning together, it is thought, there can be no doubt.

   "Your committee rejoice in being able to say, that two of your annual
   conferences, namely, New England and New York, have established
   seminaries, which, in a good degree, answer the description your
   committee would recommend. These institutions afford an encouraging
   prospect of usefulness. Your committee therefore recommend the adoption
   of the following resolutions, viz.:
    1. Resolved, by the delegates of the annual conferences in General
       Conference assembled, that it be, and it is hereby, recommended to
       all the annual conferences to establish, as soon as practicable,
       literary institutions, under their own control, in such way and
       manner as they may think proper.
    2. Resolved, &c., That it be the special duty of the episcopacy to use
       their influence to carry the above resolution into effect, by
       recommending the subject to each annual conference.
    3. Resolved, &c., That the following amendment to the second answer of
       the third question of the fourth section of the first chapter of
       the Discipline be adopted, viz.: after the word preachers, let
       there be added, And the presidents, principals, or teachers of
       seminaries of learning, which are or may be under our
       superintendence.
    4. Resolved, &c., That the principals of the Wesleyan Academy and
       Wesleyan Seminary be requested to forward a copy of their
       constitutions to each of the annual conferences.
    5. Resolved, &c., That a copy of this report be recorded on the
       journals of the several annual conferences."

   The adoption of this report by the General Conference, no doubt, tended
   greatly to subserve the cause of education, and to diffuse among us
   more generally than heretofore a desire to avail ourselves of the
   advantages to be derived from literary and scientific improvement.

   That opposition should be manifested to these efforts to raise the
   standard of education, by any of the disciples of the illustrious
   Wesley, whose profound learning added so much splendor to his character
   as an evangelical minister, may seem strange to some. This, however,
   was the fact; and their unreasonable opposition, exemplified in a
   variety of ways, tended not a little to paralyze, for a season, the
   efforts of those who had enlisted in this cause; while the apathy of
   others retarded its progress, and made its final success somewhat
   uncertain. And it has not been without much labor and persevering
   industry that this opposition has been measurably overcome, and the
   dormant energies of the Church awakened and excited to action in favor
   of this noble enterprise. Its onward march, however, has been hailed
   with no less delight by its friends than deprecated by its enemies,
   while its success thus far has added greatly to the character which
   Methodism was acquiring in the public estimation. All we now want, to
   place our literary institutions on a permanent foundation, and make
   them eminently useful, is the simultaneous and general effort of the
   members and friends of the Church to contribute liberally for their
   support and endowment.

   It has been seen in a preceding chapter that difficulties had arisen in
   Canada, growing chiefly out of the state of things which had been
   brought on by the war of 1812. In compliance with the request of the
   brethren in Quebec, and some members of the church in Montre, the
   British conference had supplied these places with missionaries; and
   through the solicitations of some individuals in Upper Canada
   missionaries had also been sent into that province, where our preachers
   had long labored with great success, amid many privations and
   sufferings, and were still working to the satisfaction of the great
   majority of the people.

   This state of things had been productive of much irritation among the
   societies in Upper Canada, protesting conflicting views and interests
   mutually injurious, and of course tending to impede the progress of
   pure religion.

   At this General Conference the subject came up for consideration, by
   numerous memorials and petitions from the several circuits in Upper
   Canada, protesting against the interference of the British
   missionaries, and praying that they might still be supplied with the
   ministry and ordinances of religion by the American conference. After a
   due consideration of the subject, the following resolutions were
   adopted: --
    1. Resolved, by the delegates of the annual conferences in General
       Conference assembled, That it is the duty of the bishops of the
       Methodist Episcopal Church to continue their episcopal charge over
       our societies in the Canadas, all except Quebec.
    2. Resolved, &c., That the following address be sent to our brethren
       in Canada: --

   "Dear Brethren: -- We have received and read with deep interest the
   affectionate memorials and addresses from the several circuits in the
   provinces of Canada, in which you have expressed your strong attachment
   to us, and your ardent desire for the continuance of our ministerial
   care over you. We most cordially reciprocate the sentiments of
   brotherly affection and Christian attachment you have expressed, and
   pledge ourselves to use our best endeavors for your spiritual and
   eternal interest.

   "We sincerely deprecate those evils of which you complain, and which
   have grown out of the conduct of the missionaries sent by the British
   conference to labor in Canada. Confiding, however, in the integrity of
   that conference, and believing they have been misled by partial and
   erroneous statements, sent by interested persons in Canada, we still
   hope that the existing embarrassments will be removed, and that an
   amicable adjustment of this unhappy affair may be brought about.

   "We can assure you that no means which, in our opinion, will be likely
   to produce this desirable result, shall be left untried.

   "That you may be convinced that we have neither been inattentive to
   your interests nor unmindful of the respect due to our British
   brethren, we beg leave to lay before you a brief statement of what has
   been done in reference to this subject.

   "It is doubtless well known to you that your case was fully laid before
   us at our last session in this city, and impartially considered in the
   presence of brothers Black and Bennett, who were sent as
   representatives by the British conference; and after hearing all that
   could be said on both sides of the question, it was resolved most
   expedient, among other reasons because we understood it was your
   earnest desire, to continue, as we had done heretofore, our ministerial
   labors among you. That the British conference might be fully apprised
   of the course we had taken, an address was sent to them, stating the
   reasons which had directed our decision in relation to Canada, and
   requesting that some arrangements might be made for an amicable
   adjustment of the existing difficulties. To this Communication we have
   received no direct answer.

   "Similar communications have been since sent, by Bishops McKendree and
   George. The letter sent by Bishop George contained a full development
   of the affairs of Canada; but neither has an answer to this been
   received. As some of the circuits have petitioned to have a separate
   annual conference in Canada, this subject has been considered, and it
   is thought to be inexpedient for the present, because, among other
   reasons, it might prevent that interchange of preachers, so very
   desirable, and so essential to your prosperity.

   "After assuring you of our unabated attachment to you as a branch of
   the Church over which we are called, in the providence of God, to
   extend our oversight, and of our determination, at your earliest
   request, as well as from a consciousness of imperious duty, to continue
   to afford you all the ministerial aid in our power, we exhort you to
   steadfastness in the faith, to unity and love, and to perseverance in
   all holy obedience.

   3.  Resolved, &c., That the following note be inserted in the
   Discipline, under the twenty-third article of our Church, viz.: As far
   as it respects civil affairs we believe it the duty of Christians, and
   especially all Christian ministers, to be subject to the supreme
   authority of the country where they may reside, and to use all laudable
   means to enjoin obedience to the powers that le: and therefore it is
   expected that all our preachers and people who may be under the British
   or any other government will behave themselves as peaceable and orderly
   subjects.'

   4.  Resolved, by the delegates of the annual conferences in General
   Conference assembled, That this conference address the British
   conference on the subject of a mutual exchange of delegates, as
   representatives of the one conference to the other."

   The first resolution was afterward so modified as to authorize the
   delegate who might be sent to England to allow the whole of the lower
   province to be given up to the British connection: and then the
   following was added: --

   5.  That the episcopacy be requested, if practicable, to send a
   delegate to the British conference at their next session in July, or at
   any time thereafter, and furnish him with the requisite instructions,
   and also to draw on the Book Concern for the amount necessary to defray
   the expense.

   6.  Resolved, &c., That the episcopacy, by and with the advice and
   consent of the Genesee conference, if they judge it expedient, previous
   to the sitting of the next General Conference, shall have authority to
   establish an annual conference in Canada."

   The Rev. J. Emory was appointed delegate, who, in addition to an
   adjustment of the existing difficulties in Canada, was instructed to
   Convey to that body the affectionate attachment of the American
   conference to their British brethren, and to request a regular
   interchange of delegates from one connection to the other, at such
   times as might be mutually satisfactory. As an assurance, however, that
   there existed a disposition, on the part of the missionary Committee in
   London, to remove all just cause of complaint, and to prevent any
   improper interference of their missionaries in the houses and places
   occupied by our preachers in Upper Canada, the following document had
   been received by Bishop McKendree and submitted to the General
   Conference: --

   "Wesleyan Mission House, 77 Hatton Garden, London, 25th February, 1819

   "Dear Sir: -- We transmit for your information the following
   resolutions, lately entered into by the committee of the General
   Wesleyan Missionary Society in London, relative to the British
   missionaries in Canada, and which resolutions have been transmitted to
   those missionaries.
    1. "Resolved, That it be recommended to the brethren in Canada to
       preach in a chapel which is now jointly occupied by the American
       brethren, and, for the sake of peace, to pursue their labor
       separately, and not to continue their labors in any station
       previously occupied by the American brethren, except when the
       population is so large, or so scattered, that it is evident a very
       considerable part of them must be neglected.
    2. "Resolved, That they are to act under the general instruction of
       the committee of June 26, 1818, viz.:

   "1. That it be communicated to the missionaries there that the
   conference and the committee never intended that the missionaries sent
   out by them should invade the societies raised up by the preachers
   appointed by the American conference, and to divide them; but that they
   should communicate the benefits of the Christian ministry to those
   parts of the country where the inhabitants are destitute of them, and
   to labor in those towns and villages where the population is so large
   that the addition of their labors to those of other ministers is
   demanded by the moral necessities of the people.

   "The foregoing resolutions will, we hope, satisfy yourself and the
   American conference that the British conference and the missionary
   committee in London feel sorry that any interference should have ever
   taken place between your missionaries and those sent by the British
   conference, who most earnestly wish that their missionaries may labor
   in harmony with all good men.

   "Praying that Christian kindness and good-will may prevail and abound,
   we are, dear sir, with Christian affection, your obedient servants,

   "Jabez Bunting, Richard Watson, Jos. Taylor, General Secretaries."

   Though the final result of this negotiation could not be known until
   some time after the adjournment of the conference, yet it seems most
   proper to finish the account of it in this place. And it is recorded
   with the more pleasure, because it evinces the disposition and
   determination, on the part of both the English and American
   conferences, not to allow the collisions which had unhappily occurred
   in Canada between individual preachers of the two connections to
   interrupt their harmony, or to weaken the strength of their friendship
   and fraternal regards.

   Mr. Emory bore with him to the British conference the following
   address: --

   "Baltimore, May 27, 1820

   "The General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United
   States of America, to the British conference of ministers and
   preachers, late in connection with the Rev. John Wesley.

   "Reverend and Dear Brethren: -- Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied
   to you, and to the Israel of God under your charge, both at home and in
   foreign countries. With a sincere and earnest desire to establish and
   preserve the most perfect harmony and peace with you, our elder
   brethren, we have adopted measures for opening such friendly
   intercourse as will, we devoutly pray, tend to the accomplishment of
   this desirable end.

   "Situated so remotely from each other, and under different forms of
   civil government, it is believed that no mode of correspondence will so
   effectually unite the European and American Methodists as an
   interchange of delegates from our respective conferences.

   We are encouraged to hope that such correspondence will be acceptable
   to you, from the consideration of the visit of Messrs. Black and
   Bennett, at our last session, and from the friendly opinion of our dear
   brother, the Rev. William Black, who has been with us during our
   present sitting in this city.

   "Should such a friendly intercourse be approved, we shall receive with
   cordiality your representative at our succeeding sessions, and, with
   the most sincere friendship and affection, reciprocate the visit.

   "The prosperity of your missions, both at home and in foreign
   countries, is matter of praise and thanksgiving to the great Head of
   the church; and our unceasing prayer is, that they still may increase
   more and more.

   "The last four years have been distinguished by no ordinary success
   within the field of our labor: our borders have been greatly enlarged,
   and the wilderness has budded and blossomed as the rose. The last year
   especially has been attended with an abundant outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit, and the increase of our numbers has exceeded that of any former
   year.

   "The field of missionary labors is opening and extending before us, and
   the Divine Providence appears to be preparing the way for the
   conversion of the Indian tribes on this vast continent.

   "The bearer, the Rev. John Emory, has been appointed our delegate to
   your body, and will be able to give you a more particular account of
   the work under our charge, and especially of our commencement and
   progress in the missionary cause.

   "Most earnestly praying that the Methodists may be identified in their
   doctrine, experience, and practice, in every part of the world, and
   that the Father of lights may pour upon you and upon us the Spirit of
   grace, and preserve us in the unity of faith, and in the fellowship and
   peace of his Son Jesus Christ, we remain, reverend and dear brethren,
   yours in the gospel of our common Lord.

   "Signed by order and in behalf of the Methodist Episcopal Church,

   Enoch George, President, Alexander McCaine, Secretary."

   To this address the following answer was sent, together with the
   resolutions in relation to the existing difficulties in Canada: --

   "To the General Superintendents of the Methodist Episcopal Church in
   the United States of America

   "Dear Brethren: -- We inclose to your care the resolutions passed by
   the conference after the letters addressed to us by the American
   General Conference, and delivered by the Rev. John Emory, had been read
   and considered.

   "In addition to the expression of our sentiments contained in those
   resolutions, on the renewal of intercourse between the two conferences,
   we are directed to request you to convey to your next General
   Conference our Warmest thanks for those declarations o unabated
   brotherly affection toward us and the connection which your letters
   contain, and for the appointment of Mr. Emory as your representative.

   "In him we have recognized the purity of your doctrine and the fervor
   and simplicity of your piety. We have received him, not as a stranger,
   but as a brother beloved.' Our hearts are as his heart; and it will be
   remembered as one of the most pleasing circumstances Connected with the
   conference held in this town, that our personal intercourse with you
   was here restored, and that this work of love' was committed to so able
   and excellent a brother, whose public ministrations and addresses in
   our conference have been equally gratifying and instructive to us and
   to our people.

   "From the statements made by Mr. Emory as to the progress of the work
   of God in the United States, we have received the greatest
   satisfaction. We offered our united thanksgivings to God that the
   doctrines of primitive Methodism, the preaching of which God has so
   eminently owned in the salvation of men and the edification of
   believers, are not only continued among you in their purity, but have
   been so widely extended by your great and persevering efforts; and that
   the same holy discipline, in all its essential parts, continues,
   wherever you form societies, to guard and confirm the work which God
   has made to prosper in your hands.

   "For the state of our affairs in Great Britain and Ireland, and in our
   missionary stations, we refer you to Mr. Emory, who, as health would
   allow, has attended our sittings, and to those publications with which,
   before his departure, we shall be happy to furnish him, to be laid
   before you.

   "You will see that we have had to rejoice with you in the great
   extension of the work of God into the various parts of the British
   empire, and that the institutions of Methodism, which we have proved to
   be so well adapted to promote and to preserve true religion, are known
   and valued in every quarter of the globe. May we, with you, be the
   honored instruments of turning the disobedient to the wisdom of the
   just in every place, and of hastening the universal kingdom of our
   Lord.

   "The resolutions on the disputes in the Canadas were adopted after a
   calm and patient consideration of the case, in which we were greatly
   assisted by Mr. Emory. We hope that they will lead to a full adjustment
   of those disputes, and that the affection which exists between the two
   connections generally will extend itself to the brethren and societies
   in the Canadas. This is the disposition which we shall earnestly
   inculcate upon those under our care in those provinces, and we have
   full confidence that the same care will be taken by you to extinguish
   every feeling contrary to love among those over whom you have control
   and influence.

   "With earnest prayers for you, dear and honored brethren, in
   particular, on whom devolve the general direction of the affairs of the
   great body of Methodists in the western world, and labors so severe,
   but so glorious, -- that you may be filled with wisdom for counsel, and
   strength to fulfill the duties of your great office; -- and also
   praying that all your churches may have rest, and, walking in the fear
   of the Lord, and in the comforts of the Holy Ghost, be abundantly
   multiplied, we are, dear brethren, yours most affectionately in Christ
   Jesus,

   "Jabez Bunting, President, George Marsden, Secretary. Liverpool,
   August, 1820."

   "Resolutions of the British Conference on American Affairs
    1. That the conference embraces with pleasure this opportunity of
       recognizing that principle which, it is hoped, will be permanently
       maintained, that the Wesleyan Methodists are one in every part of
       the world.
    2. That the British conference has frequently rejoiced in the very
       favorable account which they have received, year after year, of the
       great and glorious work which God is graciously carrying on in the
       United States of America; but that it is with peculiar pleasure
       that they receive a representative from the General Conference in
       America. The statement given by our beloved brother, Mr. Emory, of
       the present state of Methodism in America, has been received with
       much joy; and the conference also expresses its high satisfaction,
       not only in the declaration, but in the proof, of the love of our
       American brethren in fully opening the way for a brotherly
       intercourse between the European and the American societies.
    3. The conference particularly rejoices in the zeal which is
       manifested by our American brethren in carrying the gospel of our
       Lord Jesus Christ to the Indian tribes, and in the success which
       God has already given to their labors in that natural and moral
       wilderness; and hopes that the time is drawing near when the
       aborigines of that vast continent shall become the mild and gentle
       followers of our gracious Redeemer.
    4. That it is the earnest wish of this conference that the kind and
       friendly intercourse which is now opened between the British and
       the American conference should be continued; and that, prior to the
       time of holding the next General Conference in America, the British
       conference will appoint one or more of their body to visit our
       brethren in America, to be present at their General Conference.
    5. That a letter shall be sent to the American brethren, containing
       these resolutions, and strongly expressing our high approbation of
       the selection of our highly esteemed brother, Mr. Emory, as their
       representative to our conference, and of our earnest desire and
       prayer that, in the spirit of Christian love, we may ever be one in
       Christ Jesus.
    6. That there shall be a regular exchange of Minutes, magazines,
       missionary reports and notices, and all new original works,
       published by the European and American Methodists, from their
       respective book rooms.

   "On the subject of the unpleasant circumstances which have occurred in
   the Canadas between the American preachers and our missionaries,
   referred to the conference by the missionary committee in London, with
   their opinion that Upper Canada shall be left in possession of the
   American brethren, and that our missionary exertions shall be confined
   to the lower province, this committee recommend to the conference the
   adoption of the following principles and arrangements
    1. That, as the American Methodists and ourselves are but one body, it
       would be inconsistent with our unity, and dangerous to that
       affection which ought to characterize us in every place, to have
       different societies and congregations in the same towns and
       villages, or to allow of any intrusion on either side into each
       other's labors.
    2. That this principle shall be the rule by which the disputes now
       existing in the Canadas, between our missionaries, shall be
       terminated.
    3. That the simplest and most effectual manner of carrying this rule
       into effect appears to us to be, to accede to the suggestion of the
       American conference, that the American brethren shall have the
       occupation of Upper Canada, and the British missionaries that of
       Lower Canada, allowing sufficient time for carrying this
       arrangement into effect, with all possible tenderness to existing
       prejudices and conflicting interests on both sides; the arrangement
       to be Completed within a period to be fixed as early as possible by
       the missionary committee. But should insuperable difficulties occur
       in the attempt to execute this plan, (which, however, we do not
       anticipate,) either party shall be at liberty to propose any other
       mode of accommodation which shall assume as its basis the great
       principle laid down in the first of these resolutions, and which we
       are of opinion should be held most sacred in every part of the
       world.
    4. That if hereafter it shall appear to any of our brethren there,
       either British missionaries or American preachers, that any place
       on either side the boundary line, now mentioned, needs religious
       help, and presents a favorable opportunity for usefulness, the case
       shall be referred by the Canada district meeting to the General
       Conference, or by that body to the Canada district; and if either
       shall formally decline to supply the place on their own side the
       boundary, then the other shall be at liberty to supply the said
       place, without being deemed to have violated the terms of this
       friendly compact.
    5. And it shall be explicitly understood in this arrangement, that
       each party shall be bound to supply with preachers all those
       stations and their dependencies which shall be relinquished by each
       of the connections, that no place on either side shall sustain any
       loss of the ordinances of religion in consequence of this
       arrangement.
    6. That the missionary committee be directed to address a letter to
       the private and official members, trustees, &c., under the care of
       our missionaries in Upper Canada, informing them of the judgment of
       the conference, and affectionately and earnestly advising them to
       put themselves and their chapels under the pastoral care of the
       American preachers, with the suggestion of such considerations, to
       incline them to it, as the Committee may judge most proper.
    7. That the bishops of the American connection shall direct a similar
       letter to the private and official members, trustees, &c., under
       the care of the American preachers in the province of Lower Canada,
       requesting them to put themselves and their chapels under the care
       of the British missionaries."

   The instructions to the missionaries, sent out in pursuance of the
   above arrangement, are so replete with Christian urbanity and kindness,
   and so fully exemplified the spirit by which all Christian associations
   should be actuated in their intercourse with each other, that I am
   persuaded the reader will be gratified with their perusal They are as
   follows: --

   "Copy of a letter of instructions from the Missionary Committee in
   London, to the Rev. Messrs. R. Williams and the other British
   missionaries in the provinces of Canada."

   "Dear Brothers: -- Herewith we transmit you a copy of resolutions,
   passed at our late conference, on the subject of the disputes which
   have unhappily existed between our American brethren and us, relative
   to our missions in Canada.

   "The preceding resolutions are general, and refer to the renewal of the
   intercourse, by personal deputation, between the American and British
   conferences, by the visit of Mr. Emory. We have given you the
   resolutions in full, that you may see that we have recognized the
   principle that the Methodist body is ONE throughout the world, and that
   therefore its members are bound to cordial affection and brotherly
   union.

   "The resolutions of the committee, passed some time ago, and forwarded
   for your guidance, prohibiting any interference with the work of the
   American brethren, would show you that the existence of collisions
   between us and them gave us serious concern, and that the Committee
   were anxious to remove, as far as they, at that time, were acquainted
   with the circumstances, every occasion of dispute.

   "Certainly the case of Montreal chapel was one which we could never
   justify to our minds, and the committee have in many instances had but
   a partial knowledge of the real religious wants of the upper province,
   and of its means of supply. The only reason we could have for
   increasing the number of missionaries in that province was, the
   presumption of a strong necessity, arising out of the destitute
   condition of the inhabitants, the total want, or too great distance of
   ministers.

   "On no other ground could we apply money raised for missionary purposes
   for the supply of preachers to Upper Canada. The information we have
   had for two years past has all served to show that the number of
   preachers employed there by the American brethren was greater than we
   had at first supposed, and was constantly increasing.

   "To us, therefore, it now appears, that though there may be places in
   that province which are not visited, they are within the range, or
   constantly coming within the range, of the extended American
   itinerancy; and that Upper Canada does not present to our efforts a
   ground so fully and decidedly missionary as the lower province, where
   much less help exists, and a great part of the population is involved
   in popish superstition.

   "We know that political reasons exist in many minds for supplying even
   Upper Canada, as far as possible, with British missionaries; and
   however natural this feeling may be to Englishmen, and even
   praiseworthy, when not carried too far, it will be obvious to you that
   this is a ground on which, as a missionary society, and especially as a
   society under the direction of a committee which recognizes as
   brethren, and one with itself, the American Methodists, we cannot act.
    1. Because, as a missionary society, we cannot lay it town as a
       principle that those whose object is to convert the world shall be
       prevented from seeking and saving souls under a foreign government,
       for we do not thus regulate our own efforts.
    2. To act on this principle would be to cast an odium upon our
       American brethren, as though they did not conduct themselves
       peaceably under the British government, which is, we believe,
       contrary to the fact.
    3. That if any particular exceptions to this Christian and submissive
       conduct were, on their part, to occur, we have not the least right
       to interfere, unless, indeed, the Americas conference obviously
       neglected to enforce upon the offending parties its own discipline.
       Upon any political feeling which may exist, either in your minds or
       in the minds of a party in any place, we cannot therefore proceed.
       Our objects are purely spiritual, and our American brethren and
       ourselves are one body of Christians, sprung a common stock,
       holding the same doctrines, enforcing the same discipline, and
       striving in common to spread the light of true religion through the
       world.

   "In conformity with these views, we have long thought it a reproach,
   and doing more injury, by disturbing the harmony of the two
   connections, than could be counterbalanced by any local good, that the
   same city or town should see two congregations, and two societies, and
   two preachers, professing the same form of Christianity, and yet thus
   proclaiming themselves rivals to each other, and, in some instances,
   invading each other's societies and chapels, and thus producing party
   feelings. The purposes of each, we are ready to allow, have been good,
   though mistaken; and we rather blame ourselves for not having obtained
   more accurate information on some particulars, that intimate any
   dissatisfaction with the missionaries la the Canadas, with whose zeal
   and labors we have much reason to be satisfied.

   "A part of the evil has also arisen from the want of personal
   communication, by deputation, between the two conferences, now happily
   established. These considerations had long and seriously occupied our
   minds before the arrival of Mr. Emory, charged by the General American
   Conference to bring these matters under our consideration. The
   committee, previous to the conference, went with him fully into the
   discussion of the disputes in the Canadas, and recommended those
   principles of adjustment which the conference, after they had been
   referred to a special committee during the time of its sitting,
   adopted, and which we now transmit to all the brethren in the Canada
   station.

   "You will consider these resolutions as the fruit of a very ample
   inquiry, and of serious deliberation.

   "None of the principles here adopted by us do indeed go farther than to
   prevent interference with each other's labors among the American and
   British missionaries, and the setting up of altar against altar' in the
   same city, town, or village; but, knowing that circumstances of
   irritation exist, and that too near a proximity might, through the
   infirmity of human nature, lead to a violation of that union which the
   conference has deemed a matter of paramount: importance to maintain, we
   have thought it best to adopt a geographical division of the labor of
   each, and that the upper province should be left to the American
   brethren and the lower to you. The reasons for this are, --
    1. That the upper province is so adequately supplied by the American
       conference as not to present that pressing ease of necessity which
       will justify our expending our funds upon it.
    2. That Mr. Emory has engaged that its full supply by American
       preachers shall be, as far as possible, attended to.
    3. That this measure at once terminates the dispute as to Montreal.
    4. That it will prevent collision without sacrifice of public good.
    5. That Lower Canada demands our efforts rather than Upper, as being
       more destitute, and the labors of the brethren there being more
       truly missionary.

   "A transfer of societies and places of preaching will of course follow.
   Our societies in Upper Canada are to be put under the care of the
   American brethren; theirs in the lower province under yours.

   "It is clear that this, under all circumstances, will require prudent
   and wise management, and we depend upon you to carry the arrangement
   into effect in the same spirit of kindness and temper in which the
   question has been determined by the conference and Mr. Emory.

   "Feel that you are one with your American brethren, embarked in the
   same great cause, and eminently of the same religious family, and the
   little difficulties of arrangement will be easily surmounted; and if
   any warm spirits (which is probable) rise up to trouble you, remember
   that you are to act upon the great principle sanctioned by the
   conference, and not upon local prejudices. The same advices Mr. Emory
   has pledged himself shall be given to the American preachers, and you
   will each endeavor to transfer the same spirit into the societies
   respectively. When the preachers recognize each other as brethren, the
   people will naturally fall under the influence of the same feeling.

   "We have appointed our respected brethren, Messrs. Williams and Hick,
   who are to choose as an associate a third preacher in full connection,
   to meet an equal number of preachers to be appointed by the American
   bishop, who shall agree upon the time in which the chapels and
   societies shall be mutually transferred, and the arrangements of the
   conference be carried into effect. The place of the meeting they are to
   fix for their mutual convenience, but the meeting is to be held as
   early as possible after the receipt of the instructions of the
   committee, that the report of the final adjustment of the affair may
   appear in your next district minutes.

   "We conclude with our best wishes for your personal happiness and
   usefulness. May you ever go forth in the fulness of the blessing of the
   gospel of peace,' and be made the honored instruments of winning many
   souls to the knowledge and obedience of the faith of our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   "We are, dear brother, yours very affectionately,

   "Jos. Taylor, Richard Watson, Secretaries. "Wesleyan Mission House, 77
   Hatton Garden; 23d August, 1820."

   As it was agreed that our bishops should send similar instructions to
   those brethren to whom the carrying the above resolutions into
   practical effect should be committed, the following communication was
   sent to the Rev. William Case: --

   "Alexandria, (D. C.,) Oct. 16, 1820.

   "Dear Brother: -- I transmit you herewith a Copy of the resolutions of
   the late British conference, received through brother Emory, our
   representative to that body, on the subjects embraced in his mission;
   and also of the instructions of the missionary committee in London to
   the Rev. Messrs. R. Williams and the other British missionaries in the
   provinces of Canada, predicated on those resolutions.

   "From these documents you will perceive that the desire of our General
   Conference, both for the establishment of a personal intercourse by
   deputation between the two connections, and for the amicable adjustment
   of the afflicting differences in the Canadas, has been happily
   accomplished. Indeed it appears, not only from those papers, but from
   the communications of our representative, that this desire was met,
   both by, the British conference and the missionary committee, with a
   promptness and brotherly affection which we should take equal pleasure
   in acknowledging and reciprocating.

   "This it now devolves upon me (my colleagues being necessarily at a
   great distance, in the discharge of their official duties in the south
   and west) to enjoin it upon you to do; and to promote the same spirit
   of kindness toward our British brethren, among all the preachers,
   traveling and local, and all the official and private members within
   your district, to the utmost extent of your power.

   "To remove the prejudices and allay the unpleasant excitements existing
   will, no doubt, require much prudent care. But in this labor of love' I
   expect in you a ready mind. Let the difficulties you may meet with only
   stimulate you to the exertion of your best and most persevering efforts
   in this behalf. Remember, Blessed are the peacemakers.' Seek peace,
   then, and ensue it.' If it even seem to flee from you, follow it:
   Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any
   root of bitterness, springing up, trouble you, and thereby many be
   deified.'

   "In the present state of things, (your acquaintance with which renders
   detail unnecessary,) we have thought it best to agree to a division of
   our field of labors in the Canadas by the provincial line. In the
   expediency of this measure you will see that the missionary committee
   in London and the British conference have concurred; so that our labors
   there are to be confined, in future, to the upper province, and those
   of the British missionaries to the lower.

   "A transfer of societies and places of preaching will of course follow.
   Our societies in Lower Canada are to be put under the care of our
   British brethren, and theirs, in the upper province, under ours.

   "For the execution of these arrangements I have appointed brother Ryan
   and yourself, with authority to associate with you a third preacher in
   full connection, to meet the Rev. Messrs. R. Williams and Hick,
   appointed by the missionary committee, and such other preacher as they
   may associate with them. The time and place of meeting you will agree
   on with them, for your mutual convenience. The missionary committee
   have instructed their agents that the meeting is to be held as early as
   possible after the receipt of the instructions of the committee, that
   the report of the final adjustment of the affair may appear in the next
   district minutes. In this we concur. You will, therefore, immediately
   on the reception of these instructions, in conjunction with brother
   Ryan and your associate, correspond with the Rev. Messrs. Williams and
   Hick and their associate on the subject; and fail not to use every
   means in your power for the prompt execution of the arrangements in the
   best faith, and in the most harmonious and affectionate manner. In the
   language of the missionary committee we cordially unite to say, Feel
   that you are one with your' British brethren, embarked in the same
   great cause, and eminently of the same religious family, and the little
   difficulties of arrangement will be easily surmounted; and if any warm
   spirits rise up to trouble you, remember that you are to act on the
   great principles now sanctioned and avowed by the two Connections, and
   not upon local prejudices.' If each endeavor to transfuse this spirit
   into the societies respectively, the people will much more easily be
   brought under the influence of the same feeling, when it shall be found
   to possess and actuate the preachers. In any event, let there be no
   deficiency on your part in spirit, word, or deed. We commit to you a
   sacred work, which you are bound to perform, not only as to the matter,
   but in the manner, in the temper, in which, as these instructions are
   intended to show you, we ourselves would perform it, could we be
   present. Attend strictly to this, that we may have joy and consolation
   in your love, the bowels of the saints being refreshed by you; and
   forward to us, as early as possible, regular and full copies of all
   your correspondence and proceedings in this business.

   "Should it be found practicable to complete the arrangements previously
   to the next Genesee annual conference, you will of course take care to
   provide for the supply of those circuits, societies, and places of
   preaching in the upper province which may be transferred to us by our
   British brethren, as they are to provide for those which are to be
   simultaneously transferred to them in the lower province. You will also
   take care, from time to time, to extend supplies to any remaining
   places which may be found destitute in the upper province, as far as
   possible.

   "There are several circuits, I believe, in Lower Canada, attached to
   the New York and New England conferences. These are included in the
   arrangement. You will therefore forward a copy of these instructions to
   each of the presiding elders within whose districts those circuits are
   embraced, and request them to be prepared to cooperate with you in the
   final execution of the business, and to report the same at their
   ensuing annual conferences respectively.

   "The missionary committee in London having kindly furnished us with a
   copy of their instructions, we shall transmit a copy of these I now
   send you to them. You will also show them, when you meet, to the Rev.
   Messrs. Williams and Hick and their associate, and, if they desire it,
   give them a copy, that you may go on in this good work as we have
   happily begun, with that frankness and kindness which become brethren
   in such a cause.

   "By the sixth resolution of the British conference on the Canadian
   business, it is provided that the missionary committee be directed to
   address a letter to the private and official members, trustees, &c.,
   under the care of the missionaries in Upper Canada, informing them of
   the judgment of the Conference, and affectionately and earnestly
   advising them to put themselves and their chapels under the pastoral
   care of the American preachers, with the suggestion of such
   considerations to incline them to it as the committee may judge most
   proper. And by the seventh resolution it is provided that we shall
   address a similar letter to the private and official members, trustees,
   &c., under our care. I accordingly inclose a letter which you will use
   for this purpose, after you have met with Messrs. Williams and Hick,
   &c., and agreed with them on the time of making the transfer of the
   societies, chapels, &c., but not to be used before. At the same time,
   after this meeting and agreement, you will also forward a copy of this
   letter to each of the presiding elders in the New York and New England
   conferences whose districts embrace circuits in Lower Canada, to be
   used by them.

   "Confiding in your faithful discharge of the several trusts committed
   to you, I commend you to the Lord, and remain, dear brother, yours in
   love.

   "Wm. McKendree."

   The following was also addressed to the brethren therein mentioned in
   Lower Canada: --

   "To the private and official members, trustees, &c., of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church in Lower Canada

   "Very Dear Brethren: -- You are aware that, for several years past,
   very unpleasant collisions have occurred in various parts both of the
   upper and lower provinces, between the British missionaries and some of
   our brethren. This has been a source of great affliction to us, and has
   led to the adoption of various and successive measures for the
   correction of the evil.

   "Our late General Conference, being earnestly desirous of restoring the
   amicable relations of the two connections, authorized the deputation of
   a representative to the British conference for this purpose. One was
   accordingly sent. And, after a deliberate investigation, it has been
   mutually thought best, for the sake of peace and love, under all the
   circumstances of the case, to divide our labors in the Canadas in such
   a manner as to guard effectually against all collisions in future.

   "With this view, it has been agreed that our British brethren shall
   supply the lower province and our preachers the upper; yet so that no
   circuits or societies on either side shall be left destitute by the
   other. This has been sacredly attended to, and mutual pledges for the
   performance of it have been passed. It now becomes our duty, therefore,
   to inform you of this agreement, and to advise you, in the most
   affectionate and earnest manner, to put yourselves and your chapels
   under the care of our British brethren, as their societies and chapels
   in the upper province will be put under ours.

   "This communication to you, we confess, is not made without pain; not
   from any want of affection for our British brethren, but from the
   recollection of those tender and endearing ties which have bound us to
   you. But a necessity is laid upon us. It is a peace-offering. No other
   consideration could have induced us to consent to the measure. Forgive,
   therefore, our seeming to give you up. We do not give you up in heart,
   in affection, in kind regard, in prayers.

   "The British and American connections have now mutually recognized each
   other as one body of Christians, sprung from a common stock, holding
   the same doctrines, of the same religious family, and striving in
   common to speed the light of true religion through the world; and they
   have agreed to keep up a regular intercourse by deputation, in future,
   for the maintenance of this brotherly union.

   "Let any past differences, therefore, be forgotten. Let them be buried
   for ever. Confirm your love toward our British brethren, and receive
   them as ourselves; -- not as strangers, but as brothers beloved. By
   this shall all men know that we are Christ's disciples, if we love one
   another. Love is of God, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God,
   and God in him. May the God of love and peace be with you, and crown
   you with the blessedness of contributing with us to heal the wounds of
   the Church, and to establish that fellowship of the Spirit' which shall
   enable us to say, Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren
   to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the
   head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down
   to the skirts of his garments. As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
   that descended upon the mountain of Zion: for there the Lord commanded
   the blessing, even life for evermore.'

   "For any farther information that you may desire I refer you to the
   presiding elder, to whom it is given in charge to make this
   communication to you; and remain, dear brethren, with the same
   affection for you, in the bonds of the gospel of peace, and the best
   wishes and prayers for your happiness and salvation,

   "Wm. McKendree. "Alexandria, (D. C.,) October 16, 1820."

   These proceedings gave general satisfaction, and tended not a little to
   allay the uneasiness which had resulted from the collisions of
   individuals in the two provinces, as well as to soften the asperities
   of those who had suffered the heat of party zeal to carry them beyond
   the bounds of Christian moderation. This result also shows how little
   the individual and local interests of a few affect those whose position
   gives them a commanding and impartial view of the whole ground of
   controversy, and who consequently feel for the whole as for every part,
   and for every part as for the whole. And it is no small commendation of
   the Christian spirit by which each of the contracting parties was
   actuated, to find them thus ready to sacrifice individual and local
   interests for the sake of binding the entire Methodist family together
   in one great brotherhood.

   An improved edition of our Hymn Book was ordered by this General
   Conference to be printed by the book agents. The first hymn book
   printed in this country for the use of the members and friends of our
   Church was small, containing, to be sure, a choice selection, but not a
   sufficient variety of hymns to suit the different states of the human
   heart, and the several subjects which might be introduced into the
   pulpit, and other exercises of social worship and private devotion.
   This had been remedied, as was supposed, by adding, in 1808, a second
   book, consisting chiefly of hymns taken from the original hymns of John
   and Charles Wesley; but, unhappily, those who made this selection had
   taken the liberty to alter many of the hymns, by leaving out parts of
   stanzas, altering words, shortening or lengthening hymns, without much
   judgment or taste. By this injudicious method the poetry was often
   marred, and the sentiment changed much for the worse.

   These things led the New York conference, at its session in 1819, to
   request the book committee in New York, in conjunction with the book
   agents, to prepare a revised edition of our Hymn Book, to be presented
   to this General Conference, which was done accordingly. The conference
   approved of the copy, and ordered it to be printed. The following
   extract from the preface will show the extent of and reasons for the
   alterations: --

   "The Hymn Book heretofore in use among us has been thought by many to
   be defective, partly on account of the mutilated state of some of the
   hymns, and partly because of its being divided into two books. To
   remedy these inconveniences, measures have been adopted to prepare a
   revised edition of our Hymn Book, such a one as should exclude the
   defects and retain the excellences of the one heretofore published.

   "The greater part of the hymns contained in the former edition are
   retained in this, and several from Wesleys' and Coke's collections, not
   before published in this country, are added. The principal improvements
   which have been made consist in restoring those which had been altered,
   as is believed, for the worse, to their original state, as they came
   from the poetical pen of the Wesleys; for the following hymns were,
   except a few which have been taken from other authors, composed by the
   Rev. John and Charles Wesley -- names that will ever be held dear and
   in high estimation by every lover of sacred poetry."

   This edition of the Hymn Book has been in use ever since, unaltered,
   except the addition of the names of the tunes at the head of each hymn,
   and, in 1836, of a supplement, which was prepared in conformity to the
   recommendation of the General Conference of 1832. Up to this time our
   people had not been furnished with a tune book suited to the various
   meters of our most excellent hymns. This General Conference ordered the
   editors to adopt such measures as they might judge most fit to supply
   this deficiency; and they accordingly, soon after the adjournment of
   conference, appointed a committee of competent persons to make a
   selection of such tunes as were needed to enable our congregations to
   use, in their devotional exercises, any and every hymn in the published
   collection they might choose, without being compelled to omit, for the
   want of a suitable tune, those particular meters especially, which are
   among the most experimental, spiritual, and poetical in the book. The
   following preface to this collection of tunes will show the reasons for
   and the manner in which the work was accomplished: --

   "Singing forms such an interesting and important branch of divine
   service, that every effort to improve the science of sacred music
   should meet with corresponding encouragement. Nothing tends more, when
   rightly performed, to elevate the mind, and tune it to the strains of
   pure devotion. Hence the high estimation in which it has been
   constantly held by the Christian church. Indeed, every considerable
   revival of true godliness has been attended, not only with the
   cultivation and enlargement of knowledge in general, but of sacred
   poetry and music in particular. Singing and making melody in the heart
   to the Lord is the natural result of having the love of God shed abroad
   in the heart by the Holy Spirit. The melodious notes of many voices,
   harmoniously uniting to sound the praises of God, cannot but inspire
   the heart of the Christian to devotion, and elevate the affections to
   things spiritual and divine. Who, then, can be uninterested in the
   improvement of a science so beneficial to the church of God! What hear
   t that has ever vibrated to the inspiring sounds of sacred and vocal
   music, but must exult in every attempt that is made to cultivate and
   diffuse the knowledge of this useful auxiliary in spreading the
   knowledge of God our Saviour!

   "Though the Methodist Episcopal Church has never been insensible to the
   advantages resulting from the knowledge and practice of vocal music,
   having always used it perhaps more than most other denominations of
   Christians -- in public assemblies and private associations; yet a
   suitable tune book, adapted to the various hymns and meters of its Hymn
   Book, has long been a desideratum in its spiritual economy. Several
   efforts, indeed, have been made, by individuals, to supply this
   deficiency. The subject was brought before the General Conference at
   its last session; and it was finally referred to the discretion of the
   book agents.

   "Believing such a collection of tunes, as should be suited to the
   various meters and subjects of our hymns, would be highly advantageous
   to the members and friends of our Church, soon after the conference
   closed its session, the agents adopted measures to accomplish this very
   desirable object. For this purpose a committee, consisting of members
   of our Church, was appointed, who, besides their competency to this
   undertaking, felt a deep interest in the reputation and utility of this
   very important part of divine service. They were requested, in
   conformity as nearly as practicable to the requisition of our
   Discipline, to make a selection of tunes from authors of approved
   merit, keeping in view the various sections of our widely extended
   connection, that the peculiarity of taste, in the choice of tunes,
   might, as far as possible, be gratified. They entered upon their labor
   with cheerfulness, and persevered with conscientious care and diligence
   until they brought their work to a close: and the tunes comprised in
   the following selection will evince the result of their exertions, and
   their communication to the agents, with which we close this preface,
   will explain the manner in which they executed the trust confided to
   them.

   "Dear Brethren: -- Your Committee, whose task it has been, by your
   request, to compile a book of tunes for the use of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, report: That they have been fully aware of the
   extreme difficulty of making such a collection of tunes as should in
   all respects be accommodated either to the fancy or taste of every
   section of our widely extended connection. In the use of any particular
   style of tunes, so much generally depends upon education, local
   feelings, or mental constitution, that, except with those who are
   skilled in the science of music, the choice of a tune is seldom Caused
   by a discovery of its intrinsic worth, or its adaptation to the
   solemnities of Christian worship. Your committee, therefore, will
   neither be surprised nor disappointed if their selection, in coming
   before the public, meet with some of those discouragements which have
   attended works of a similar nature.

   "Your committee, however, have not been regardless of the partialities
   of our societies in different parts of the Union. They have availed
   themselves of standard works which have obtained celebrity in the
   eastern and southern states, as well as those that are in general use
   among us. The best European authors have also been consulted. Books
   edited by members of our Church, or with a design to suit our Hymn
   Book, have received particular attention. They have neglected no means
   of ascertaining the wishes of our friends, and of accommodating, as far
   as possible, their plan to those wishes.

   "It may be proper to suggest that the primary object of your committee
   has been, not to prepare a collection of tunes for social circles or
   singing associations, (though they hope the work will not be
   unacceptable even in this light,) but, according to your own
   directions, for the use of worshipping congregations. They have
   therefore, in the first place, carefully avoided the choice of all such
   tunes as, from the intricacy or unsuitableness of their style, are
   incapable of being easily learned by ordinary congregations; for one of
   the most important objects of public singing is lost when every tuneful
   voice in the house of God cannot join in the solemn exercise.

   "Secondly, In cordial approbation of that clause of our Discipline
   which disapproves of fugue tunes, they have (with the exception of a
   very few, the use of which has been established by general practice)
   passed by those distinguished by that peculiarity.

   "Thirdly, In order to assist leaders of singing, they have carefully
   affixed over each hymn in the new Hymn Book the name of such tune as,
   in their opinion, is suitable to that hymn.

   "Your committee have thought proper to insert brief instructions in the
   rudiments of music, which will be found of great utility where the work
   is introduced into singing schools.

   "Thus, after the labor of nearly a twelvemonth [a quaint term for
   "year" -- DVM], your committee have the pleasure of delivering into
   your hands the result of their joint exertions: they are happy in
   having this opportunity of contributing their part toward the
   improvement of one of the most delightful, as well as one of the most
   devotional parts of divine worship. Uninfluenced by the expectation or
   desire of any pecuniary recompense, they only wish as a reward for
   their labors the approbation of their brethren, beloved in Christ, who
   compose the general and annual conferences, and that of the membership
   of the Methodist Church. We have long needed a work which might be
   considered as a standard of music for our connection in America. That
   which your committee present to you is an attempt for this, according
   to the best of their judgment.

   "Finally, praying that the blessing of Heaven may accompany their
   efforts, they would subjoin the language of our bishops as a just
   expression of their own sentiments: "We exhort all to sing with the
   Spirit and with the understanding also; and thus may the high praises
   of God be set up from east to west, from north to south; and we shall
   be happily instrumental in leading the devotion of thousands, and shall
   rejoice to join them in time and eternity." -- All which is
   respectfully submitted.

   "New York, October 23, 1821.'"

   This book continued in use until 1832, when a revised edition of these
   tunes was published, in obedience to the orders of the General
   Conference. In 1836, believing that a greater variety of tunes was
   needed to meet the wants of our growing Church, better suited to the
   various tastes and peculiar habits of the several sections of our
   country, our book agents and editors adopted the very judicious course
   of selecting a committee composed of a member from Boston, New York,
   Philadelphia, and Baltimore, who prepared the edition now in use, and
   which, I believe, gives general satisfaction.

   With a view to prevent, as far as practicable, our people from running
   heedlessly into debt in procuring houses of worship, to secure them
   permanently for the use of the ministers and members of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church in the places where they should be built, as well as
   to check the practice of selling or renting the slips, the following
   resolutions were adopted, and ordered to be incorporated in the
   Discipline, in answer to the question, "Is any thing advisable in
   regard to building?"
    1. That from this date no house of worship under our charge shall be
       built, or the building commenced, until the site or ground on which
       such house or houses are to be located is secured to the church as
       our deed of settlement directs, and said deed is legally executed.
    2. That from and after this date no house of worship under our charge
       shall be commenced until three-fourths of the money necessary to
       complete the building be in hand or subscribed. The estimate of the
       sum necessary for the whole expense of said house or houses to be
       made by a judicious committee, to consist of at least three members
       of our Church, to be chosen by the quarterly meeting conference of
       the circuit or station in which such house or houses are designed
       to be built.
    3. That it be made the duty of each presiding elder and preacher in
       charge to make proper inquiry in their districts, circuits, and
       stations respecting the title we have to our houses of worship; and
       in all cases where a title is found deficient, to adopt the most
       judicious and prudent measures to have them secured as directed in
       our deed of settlement, and whenever a vacancy is found in the
       trusteeship to have it filled, as directed in the Discipline.
    4. That the practice of building houses with pews, and the renting and
       selling said pews, is contrary to our economy, and that it be the
       duty of the several annual conferences to use their influence to
       prevent such houses from being built in future, and, as far as
       possible, to make those free which have already been built with
       pews.
    5. That in future we will admit of no charter, deed, or conveyance for
       any house to be used by us as a house of worship, unless it be
       provided in such charter, deed, or conveyance that the trustees of
       said house shall at all times permit such ministers. and preachers,
       belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Church, as shall from time to
       time be duly authorized by the General Conference of said Church,
       or by the annual conference, to preach and expound Gods holy word,
       and to execute the rules and discipline of the Church, and to
       administer the sacraments therein, according to the true meaning
       and purport of our deed of settlement."

   The rule in reference to the preliminary steps to be taken in regard to
   procuring funds for building churches has been but little heeded, our
   people thinking, probably, that they understand this matter better than
   the General Conference, and hence, in many instances, debts have been
   contracted to such an amount as to render the situation of the trustees
   extremely embarrassing, if not indeed almost ruinous. Nor has all that
   has been said and done to prevent the renting or selling of slips
   checked the practice, for it has gone on steadily increasing among us
   in most of the northern conferences. It would seem, however, that the
   advocates for the exclusive free seat system were determined at this
   conference to make a strong effort to annihilate the practice; for in
   the first answer to the above question, which until now read, "Let all
   our churches be built plain and decent," were added the words, "and
   with free seats." This amendment, however, was not carried without
   great opposition from those delegates who felt the necessity, either to
   have no houses at all, or to permit them to be built with a view to
   rent or sell the seats.

   A very important alteration was made at this conference in respect to
   local preachers. Until now they had been identified with the quarterly
   meeting conferences, had received their license to preach on the
   recommendation of this meeting, and were amenable to it for their
   moral, Christian, and official conduct, with the privilege of an appeal
   to an annual conference in case they had been censured, suspended, or
   expelled by the quarterly conference. A little uneasiness had been
   manifested at times, by some of the local preachers, because they
   thought they had been abridged of some of their rights, in not being
   permitted to be examined, licensed, and tried by their peers
   exclusively. To remove the cause of their dissatisfaction by granting
   the privilege of transacting the business which related to themselves
   exclusively, this General Conference created a District Conference," to
   be composed of "all the local preachers in the" (presiding elder's)
   "district who shall have been licensed two years." Of this meeting the
   presiding elder of the district, or, in his absence, such person as the
   district meeting might elect for the purpose, was to be president. This
   conference was authorized to grant licenses to proper persons to preach
   as local preachers, to renew their licenses, to recommend to annual
   conferences suitable persons for deacon's or elder's orders in the
   local ministry, for admission on trial in an annual conference, to try,
   suspend, expel, or acquit such local preachers as might be accused; but
   it could not license any man to preach unless he were recommended by a
   quarterly meeting conference: in fact, all the powers formerly
   belonging to the quarterly conference, which related to local
   preachers, except simply the privilege of recommending the candidates
   to the office of local preachers, were transferred to this district
   conference.

   As was foreseen by some who were opposed to this startling innovation
   upon a long established usage, this conference by no means worked well.
   Many of the local preachers themselves were much dissatisfied with it,
   and hence, in various parts of the country, it was difficult to convene
   a sufficient number to do business; while in others, where they were
   most active in procuring the passage of the law creating and defining
   the powers of this conference, a spirit of insubordination,
   incompatible with the rights and privileges of the itinerancy, began to
   manifest itself; and there can be no doubt that this injudicious
   measure, which had been presented to and carried through the conference
   with some precipitancy, tended to foment that spirit of radicalism
   which ended in the secession of the party who styled themselves
   "Reformers," and who have since organized under the name of the
   "Protestant Methodist Church."

   In consequence of witnessing these effects of the present organization,
   the powers of the district conferences were from time to time somewhat
   abridged, replacing in the quarterly meeting conference the power of
   transacting the affairs relating to local preachers, where and when the
   district conference did not assemble, until finally, in 1836, the
   district conference was dissolved, and its rights, powers, and
   privileges reverted back to the quarterly meeting conference, where
   they have been and are now exercised, to the general satisfaction of
   all concerned.

   As the constitution of our Missionary Society contemplated the
   co-operation of the General Conference, having given authority to that
   body to incorporate an article for the appointment of missionaries, and
   for regulating the manner in which the funds for their support should
   be drawn, the subject came up for consideration before this General
   Conference, and its deliberations resulted in the adoption of the
   following report, which was drawn up, I believe, by the late Bishop
   Emory: --

   "Your committee regard the Christian ministry as peculiarly a
   missionary ministry. Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
   every creature,' is the very foundation of its authority, and develops
   its character simultaneously with its origin.

   "The success which attended the itinerant and missionary labors of the
   first heralds of salvation farther establishes the correctness of this
   view, and demonstrates the divine sanction of this method of spreading
   the gospel.

   "In process of time, however, the missionary spirit declined, and the
   spirit of genuine Christianity with it. Then it pleased the Lord to
   raise up the Messrs. Wesleys, Whitefield, and others, through whose
   itinerant and missionary labors a great revival of vital piety was
   commenced, the progress and extent of which, at present, your committee
   cannot but regard as cause of unbounded thankfulness and pleasure.

   "The missions of Boardman and Pilmoor, of Wright, of Asbury, and
   others, are events in our history not soon to be forgotten. A grateful
   people feel their happy influence and hold their memory dear, and
   generations yet unborn will rise up and call them blessed.

   "Can we, then, be listless to the cause of missions, We cannot.
   Methodism itself is a missionary system. Yield the missionary spirit,
   and you yield the very lifeblood of the cause.

   "In missionary efforts our British brethren are before us. We
   congratulate them on their zeal and their success. But your committee
   beg leave to entreat this conference to emulate their example. The
   time, indeed, may not yet be come in which we should send our
   missionaries beyond seas. Our own continent presents to us fields
   sufficiently vast, which are opening before us, and whitening to the
   harvest. These, it is probable, will demand all the laborers and all
   the means which we can command at present.

   "You will permit your committee to mention some of those missionary
   grounds which may have a peculiar claim to your first attentions. They
   are the Canadas, the Floridas, the state of Louisiana, the territories
   of Arkansas and Missouri, our western frontiers generally, having
   regard to those who use the French, Spanish, or other foreign
   languages, as well as to those who use the English; together with any
   destitute places in the interior in which circuits may not yet have
   been formed, and where it may be judged important to have efficient
   missions.

   "In a particular manner the committee solicit the attention of the
   Conference to the condition of the aborigines of our Country, the
   Indian tribes. American Christians are certainly under peculiar
   obligations to impart to them the blessings of Civilization and
   Christian light. That there is no just cause to despair of success,
   through grace, in this charitable and pious undertaking, is
   demonstrated by the fact that there are already gathered into Church
   fellowship about sixty members of the Wyandot tribe, in the state of
   Ohio; and that a successful mission, under our direction, is now in
   operation among them. Why might not similar success attend other
   missions among other tribes? Is the Lord's arm shortened that he cannot
   save our brothers of the forest? or is his ear heavy that he will not
   hear in their behalf?

   "The government of the United States has manifested a disposition
   toward the Indians which may contribute much, not only to their
   civilization, but to their evangelization. Ten thousand dollars
   annually have been appropriated by congress for the establishment of
   schools among them. By this act it is required that the plan of
   education embrace, for the boys, in addition to reading, writing, and
   arithmetic, the practical knowledge of agriculture, and of such of the
   mechanic arts as are suited to the condition of the Indians; and for
   the girls, spinning, weaving, and sewing. This your committee consider
   a very judicious regulation, and perfectly compatible with the duties
   of missionaries, if men of families who might be established among
   them, as teachers in those schools, while their wives would assist in
   the instruction of the girls in their appropriate departments. The
   civilization of the Indians will promote their evangelization.

   Indeed, your committee are decidedly of opinion, that it is the rising
   generation among the Indians to whom your attention should be chiefly
   directed; and that the institution of schools among them, on the
   government plan, and under the government patronage, should be your
   first care. It will be necessary, at the same time, in the appointment
   of teachers to select suitable persons, with a view to the ulterior
   object of Christian instruction, both to the youth and the adult; which
   object, it is evident, will be greatly promoted by means of a common
   language; by the influence which a teacher will have over the youth;
   and by the free access which will be gained, through them, to their
   parents and friends. This is the course which has been pursued by our
   missionary brethren of the British connection in the island of Ceylon,
   and, your committee believe, with great success.

   "Several denominations have already availed themselves of the proffered
   aid of government above mentioned, and have flourishing schools, of a
   missionary character, now in operation among different tribes.

   "The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions have an
   establishment of this kind on the Chickamaugah, in the Cherokee
   country, and another among the Choctaws. At the first are about one
   hundred Indian Children, and at the second from forty to sixty. This
   board have also directed their attention to the country west of the
   Mississippi, and an establishment similar to those above named is
   already in a state of forwardness there. Besides these, branches are
   organized in different parts of the Cherokee and Choctaw Countries; and
   measures are in operation to establish two other principal schools, one
   for the benefit of the Creeks and the other for the Chickasaws.

   "The Baptist society have a school in Kentucky, at the Great Crossings,
   to which fifteen or twenty Indian children have been sent from the
   Indian country: and they are about to organize a school at the Valley
   Towns, in the Cherokee country.

   "At Spring-place, in the Cherokee nation, there has been a school for
   fourteen years, under the care of the Moravians, which is said to have
   been productive of much good.

   "The United Foreign Missionary Society of New York are about organizing
   a school west of the Mississippi, and also for the benefit of the
   emigrant Cherokees. It is supposed they will go into operation in the
   course of this spring and summer.

   "Your committee had felicitated themselves on the pleasing and inviting
   openings for such institutions which had appeared, particularly among
   the Wyandots; of which tribe many, through the instrumentality of our
   missions, have already been turned from darkness to light, and from the
   power of Satan unto God. But while we have been delaying, others have
   stepped in. The agent of that tribe has informed a member of your
   committee that he has written to the secretary of war to place the
   proportion of the ten thousand dollars per annum, allowed by congress,
   which may be allotted to that agency, at the disposal of the committee
   of Friends on Indian concerns, in this city; and they have it in
   contemplation to open three schools, the ensuing summer, in the said
   agency.

   "Your committee hope not to be understood as expressing any regret at
   the zeal of other denominations in so good a cause. Far from it. The
   mention of this is intended rather to provoke ourselves to love and to
   good works. There yet is room.

   "From the above sketch it will be seen how the spirit of missions is
   diffusing itself in our country. It ought to be cherished and rightly
   directed. If we do not cherish it, others will. It is of God, and will
   prevail.

   "Indeed, many of the Indians themselves, bordering on our improved
   settlements, are roused to a sense of their deplorable condition. With
   outstretched arms they cry to us, and say, Come and help us!' Your
   Committee believe it a call of Providence, which should be obeyed.

   With these views they submit the following resolutions, viz.: --

   "Resolved, by the delegates of the annual conferences in General
   Conference assembled,
    1. That this Conference do highly approve of the institution of the
       Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the City of
       New York, and, on the recommendation of the managers thereof; do
       agree to and adopt its constitution.
    2. That it be, and hereby is, earnestly recommended to all the annual
       conferences to take such measures as they may deem most advisable
       for the establishment of branch societies, auxiliary to the parent
       Methodist Missionary Society at New York, in all convenient and
       practicable places within their bounds; and that it be the duty of
       the general superintendents to communicate this recommendation to
       the said conferences, and to use their best endeavors and influence
       to have it carried into speedy and general effect.
    3. That this conference do fully approve of the plan of education for
       the civilization of the Indians, required by a circular, in
       conformity with an act of congress, issued from the department of
       war, by the Hon. J. C. Calhoun, on the 3d of September, 1819, and
       by a supplement thereto, issued from the department on the 29th of
       February last; and that they do hereby authorize the general
       superintendents of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and any others
       who, under their direction, may be engaged in establishing,
       organizing, or conducting such school or schools, to act in
       conformity therewith.
    4. That the superintendents be, and hereby are, requested to, keep in
       view the selection of a suitable missionary station westwardly or
       southwestwardly -- where a person may be appointed, as soon as they
       may deem it expedient, to have charge of the missions which are or
       may be in that direction, in the absence of the general
       superintendents.
    5. That a more particular and regular attention ought to be paid to
       the instruction of the destitute souls in our cities, towns, and
       country places; and that the same be and is hereby earnestly urged
       on all our preachers who may be appointed to such places
       respectively; and more especially in stations where such
       instructions may be given with the greatest regularity and effect:
       in which good cause the said preachers are advised and requested,
       by all prudent and affectionate means, to engage, as far as
       possible, the aid of our brethren the local preachers.
    6. That this conference do highly approve of the pious zeal which
       caused the institution of the Mite Society of Philadelphia, for
       promoting domestic and foreign missions; that the thanks of this
       conference be, and hereby are, rendered to the said society for the
       same, and for their friendly address to this conference on the
       subject; but that, having adopted a modified constitution of a
       missionary society, to be established in New York, from the objects
       of which the publishing of Bibles has been separated, for the
       reasons contained in the said address from Philadelphia, and also
       on the recommendation of the society in New York, and contemplating
       very important advantages from having the parent missionary society
       located where the Book Concern is conducted, so that the editor and
       general book steward for the time being may always be treasurer
       thereof, this General Conference do respectfully and affectionately
       recommend to the society in Philadelphia to become auxiliary to
       that in New York.

   "All which is respectfully submitted. "Wm. Ryland, Chairman.
   "Baltimore, May 15, 1820."

   It will be perceived from the sixth resolution of this report that our
   brethren in Philadelphia had also presented an address to the
   conference, in reference to their missionary society, and likewise the
   reasons for the preference given to the one which originated in the
   city of New York; the chief of which was, that the location of the
   parent society might be in the same place with the Book Concern, as it
   was expected that these two institutions would greatly aid and mutually
   support each other, and experience has proved that the expectation was
   well founded.

   At the formation of this society it was intended to print and circulate
   Bibles and Testaments gratuitously, in connection with spreading the
   gospel by means of missionary labors; and hence it was called the
   "Missionary and Bible Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church;" but
   being convinced, upon more mature reflection, that the American Bible
   Society, which was now in successful operation, was fully adequate to
   the task of supplying the community with the sacred Scriptures, the
   society recommended to the General Conference to strike the word Bible
   from the title, that it might confine its efforts exclusively to
   missionary labors, and so more effectually fulfill the primary design
   of its organization. This was accordingly done, and the word "America"
   was also stricken out, as this was unnecessary to designate the
   character of the society, there being no other missionary society of
   the "Methodist Episcopal Church" in existence.

   As the original constitution of this society has been altered from time
   to time by the General Conference, on the recommendation of the board
   of managers, that the reader may see at once how the affairs of the
   society are conducted, and for what ends, I will insert the
   constitution as it now stands, (1839,) without referring to the
   minutiae of those amendments by which it has been brought to its
   present improved character. It is as follows: --

  "REVISED CONSTITUTION

   Of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church

   Article 1. This association, denominated The Missionary Society of The
   Methodist Episcopal Church,' is established for the express purpose of
   enabling the several annual conferences more effectually to extend
   their missionary labors throughout the United States and elsewhere; and
   also to assist in the support and promotion of missionary schools and
   missions in our own and in foreign countries.

   Article 2. The payment of two dollars annually shall constitute a
   member; the payment of twenty dollars at one time a member for life.

   Article 3. The officers of this society shall consist of a president,
   vice presidents, clerk, treasurer, and assistant treasurer, who,
   together with thirty-two managers, shall form a board for the
   transaction of business. They shall all be members of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, and he annually elected by the society. Each annual
   conference shall have also the privilege of appointing one vice
   president from its own body.

   Article 4. There shall also be a resident corresponding secretary
   appointed by the General Conference, whose salary shall be fixed and
   paid by the board of managers, who shall be exclusively employed in
   conducting the correspondence of the society, and, under the direction
   of the board, in promoting its general interests, by traveling or
   otherwise. With the approbation of the managers, he may employ such
   assistance, from time to time, as may be judged necessary for the
   interests of the cause; the compensation for which shall be fixed by
   the board. He shall be, ex officio, a member of the board of managers.
   Should his office become vacant by death, resignation, or otherwise,
   the board shall have power to provide for the duties of the office
   until the next session of the New York conference, which, with the
   concurrence of the presiding bishop, shall fill the vacancy until the
   ensuing General Conference.

   Article 5. The board shall have authority to make by laws for
   regulating its own proceedings, to appropriate money to defray
   incidental expenses, and to print books at our own press, for the
   benefit of Indian and other foreign missions, fill up vacancies that
   may occur during the year, and shall present a statement of its
   transactions and funds to the society, at its annual meeting, and also
   shall lay before the General Conference a report of its transactions
   for the four preceding years, and the state of its funds.

   Article 6. Ordained ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   whether traveling or local, being members of this society, shall be, ex
   officio, members of the board of managers.

   Article 7. The annual meeting, for the election officers and managers,
   shall be held on the third Monday in April, in the city of New York.

   Article 8. At all meetings of the society and of the board, the
   president, or, in his absence, the vice president first on the list
   then present, and in the absence of all the vice presidents, a member
   appointed by the meeting for that purpose, shall preside.

   Article 9. Twenty-five members, at all meetings of the society, and
   thirteen at all meetings of the board of managers, shall be a quorum.

   Article 10. The minutes of each meeting shall be signed by the
   chairman.

   Article 11. It is recommended, that within the bounds of each annual
   conference there be established a conference missionary society,
   auxiliary to this institution, with branches, under such regulations as
   the conferences shall respectively prescribe. Each conference, or other
   auxiliary society, shall annually transmit to the corresponding
   secretary of this society a copy of its annual report, embracing the
   operations of its branches, and shall also notify the treasurer of the
   amount collected in aid of the missionary cause, which amount shall be
   subject to the order of the treasurer of the parent society, as
   provided for in the thirteenth article.

   Article 12. Any auxiliary or branch society may appropriate any part or
   the whole of its funds to any one individual mission, or more, under
   the care of this society, which special appropriation shall be publicly
   acknowledged by the board: but in the event that more funds be raised
   for any individual mission than is necessary for its support, the
   surplus shall go into the general treasury of the parent society, to be
   appropriated as the constitution directs.

   Article 13. The treasurer of this society, under the direction of the
   board of managers, shall give information to the bishops annually, or
   oftener, if the board judge it expedient, of the state of the funds,
   and the sums which may be drawn by them for the missionary purposes
   contemplated by this constitution: agreeably to which information the
   bishops shall have authority to draw upon the treasurer for any sum
   within the amount designated, which the missionary committee of the
   annual conferences respectively shall judge necessary for the support
   of the missions and of the mission schools under their care; provided
   always, that the sums so allowed for the support of a missionary shall
   not exceed the usual allowance of other itinerant preachers. The
   bishops shall always promptly notify the treasurer of all drafts made
   by them, and shall require regular quarterly communications to be made
   by each of the missionaries [5] to the corresponding secretary of the
   society, giving information of the state and prospects of the several
   missions in which they are employed. No one shall be acknowledged a
   missionary, or receive support out of the funds of this society, who
   has not some definite field assigned to him, or who could not be an
   effective laborer on a circuit.

   Article 14. Whenever a foreign mission is to be established, either
   among the aborigines of our country or elsewhere, it shall be the duty
   of the bishop making such appointment immediately to notify the
   treasurer of the missionary society of the place, the number of
   missionaries to be employed, together with the probable amount
   necessary for the support of any such mission; which information shall
   be laid before the managers of the society; and they shall make an
   appropriation according to their judgment, from year to year, of the
   amount called for to sustain and prosecute the mission or missions
   designated; for which amount the missionary, or the superintendent of
   the mission or missions, shall have authority to draw on the treasurer
   of the society, in quarterly or half-yearly installments.

   Article 15. In all cases oft he appointment of a missionary, the name
   of such missionary, and the district in which he is to labor, together
   with the probable expenses of the mission, shall be communicated by the
   bishop or the mission committee of each annual conference to the
   treasury of this society; that a proper record of the same may be
   preserved.

   Article 16. This constitution shall not be altered but by the General
   Conference, upon the recommendation of the board of managers."

   It was ordered that five hundred copies of the report on missions
   together with the amended constitution, should be immediately printed,
   that the delegates might furnish themselves with copies to carry to
   their respective districts and circuits.

   These doings of the conference in relation to the Missionary Society
   exerted a most favorable influence upon the cause, and tended mightily
   to remove the unfounded objections which had existed in some minds
   against this organization.

   Having witnessed much confusion in the conference when appeals from the
   lower tribunals had been presented, the following clause was added to
   the Discipline, with a view to regulate the manner in which appeals
   should be hereafter conducted

   "In all the above-mentioned cases it shall be the duty of the secretary
   of the annual conference to keep regular minutes of the trial,
   including all the questions proposed to the witnesses, and their
   answers, together with the crime with which the accused is charged, the
   specification or specifications, and also preserve all the documents
   relating to the case, which minutes and documents only, in case of an
   appeal from the decision of an annual conference, shall be presented to
   the General Conference, in evidence on the case. And in all cases when
   an appeal is made, and admitted by the General Conference, the
   appellant shall either state personally or by his representative (who
   shall be a member of the conference) the grounds of his appeal, showing
   cause why he appeals, and he shall be allowed to make his defense
   without interruption. After which the representatives of the annual
   conference, from whose decision the appeal is made, shall be permitted
   to respond in presence of the appellant, who shall have the privilege
   of replying to such representatives, which shall close the pleadings on
   both sides. This done, the appellant shall withdraw, and the conference
   shall decide. And after such form of trial and expulsion, the person so
   expelled shall have no privileges of society or sacraments in our
   Church, without confession, contrition, and proper trial."

   These are all the acts and doings of this conference worthy of record,
   except what has been heretofore noticed concerning the election and
   duties of presiding elders, and the resolutions regarding the Book
   Concern and slavery, which will be noted in another place. It may be
   proper, however, to add, that Nathan Bangs was elected principal, and
   Thomas Mason assistant agent and editor of the Book Concern; and as
   this conference resolved to establish a branch at Cincinnati, Martin
   Ruter was appointed to its agency.

   The conference adjourned May the 27th, to meet again in the city of
   Baltimore, May 1, 1824.

   The conflicting opinions in relation to the presiding elder question,
   on slavery, and concerning renting pews in churches, and some other
   matters, had elicited considerable debate, and sometimes, as is usual
   on such occasions, not of the most hallowed and conciliatory character,
   by which means the feelings of some of the members were somewhat
   chafed, and they went home under a state of mind not the most friendly
   one toward another. Time for calm deliberation, however, and the mutual
   interchange of sentiments and feelings in their respective annual
   conferences, gradually wore away this momentary irritation, and
   restored them to that fervor of spirit and devotion to the cause of God
   by which they had been heretofore distinguished.

CHAPTER 6

    From the Close of the General Conference of 1820 to the Beginning of the
    General Conference of 1824

   According to the decision of the late General Conference, there was an
   additional annual conference created this year called Kentucky making
   in all twelve. This conference, it was stated, "shall include the
   Kentucky, Salt River, Green River, and Cumberland districts, and that
   part of the state of Virginia included in the Green Brier and Monroe
   circuits, heretofore belonging to the Baltimore conference, and the
   Kenawa and Middle Island circuits, heretofore belonging to the Ohio
   conference."

   This division of labor into twelve annual conferences gave to each
   effective bishop -- for, as Bishop McKendree had been released from
   effective labor in consequence of his debility, there were but two --
   six conferences to attend, which, in the extension of the work,
   particularly in the west and southwest, made their labors extremely
   arduous. They, however, entered upon their work with diligence and
   zeal; and although Bishop McKendree was not required to perform
   effective service, yet he attended as many of the conferences as his
   strength would allow, and was particularly useful in the missionary
   department of the work, in which be took a deep and lively interest.

   Notwithstanding what had been done to supply the destitute portions of
   our country with the word and ordinances of Christianity, there were
   yet many parts unprovided for, particularly in the southwestern states
   and territories. The state of Louisiana, which contained at this time
   not less than 220,000 inhabitants, about one fourth of whom were
   slaves, was almost entirely destitute of evangelical instruction. About
   three fourths of the population were French Roman Catholics, but few of
   whom could either speak or understand the English language, and the
   greater proportion of these had never heard a Protestant minister.

   In this large territory there was a presiding elder's district,
   including only two circuits, called Attakapas and Washataw, in which
   there were one hundred and fifty-one white and fifty-eight colored
   members, under the charge of three preachers, including the presiding
   elder. How inadequate they were all to meet the spiritual wants of the
   people, may be inferred from the fact, that one of these preachers
   traveled not less than five hundred and eighty miles every five weeks,
   in order to preach to as many of the people in their scattered
   settlements as he possibly could. In this state of things the few whose
   hearts the Lord had touched sent up a loud and urgent call to the
   rulers of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and made their earnest
   appeals to the managers of our Missionary Society for ministerial help.
   After consulting with Bishop McKendree in reference to the best manner
   of answering these earnest appeals, the managers selected a young
   preacher of promising talents, Ebenezer Brown, who was approved of and
   appointed by Bishop George, and, with a view to qualify himself for his
   work, he entered upon the study of the French language. He went finally
   to his field of labor, but the enterprise proved a failure. Such were
   the prejudices of the French population, fomented as they were by
   priestly influence, that the missionary could gain no access to the
   people; and hence, after spending some time in preaching to an English
   congregation in New Orleans, he returned to the New York conference, in
   which he continued until he located.

   But though these efforts to send the gospel in that direction, like
   many others of a similar character which had been made to benefit the
   Catholic population, were unsuccessful, the prospects in other places,
   particularly among the aborigines of our country, were more flattering.
   These long neglected people, the original lords of the soil, began to
   attract the attention of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and by one of
   those singular providences which so strikingly indicate the wisdom and
   power of God in selecting the means for the accomplishment of his
   purposes of mercy, a work of grace had been commenced among the Wyandot
   Indians in Upper Sandusky, in the state of Ohio.

   That the reader may duly estimate the difficulties with which the
   missionaries had to contend, in their efforts to convert these savages
   to the Christian faith, it is necessary that he should know something
   of their superstitions, customs, and manner of living, as well as the
   great diversity of languages which are spoken by the several tribes.

   Within the bounds of the United States and territories there were
   remaining, according to the most accurate estimate which could he made
   of all the numerous tribes which once inhabited this land, only about
   one hundred and thirty thousand; and there were supposed to be in the
   Canadas, chiefly of the Chippeway [sic], Mohawk, and Missisauga tribes,
   about fifty thousand more. Such inroads had disease, wars, and
   intemperance made upon this once numerous and powerful people, the
   aboriginal lords of the soil, that these several tribes of Indians were
   but fragments of what they once were, scattered about in small
   insulated groups, some of them half civilized, and many melted down to
   mere handfuls in comparison to their former numbers.

   These one hundred and thirty thousand were divided into not less than
   sixty-five different tribes, speaking almost as many languages, some
   reduced to as few as thirty in a tribe, while the largest number did
   not exceed thirty thousand in any one tribe. What a difficulty does
   this single circumstance present in the way of their conversion! And
   how hopeless must their case have appeared to all who looked at them
   merely with the eye of human reason! But the faith of the Christian
   surveyed them with very different feelings, and prompted him to adopt
   measures for their melioration and salvation.

   Though each tribe may have some religious notions and customs, as well
   as modes of life, peculiar to itself, yet in the general outline of
   heathen superstitions and manner of savage life they all agree; and
   hence a general description of these things may answer the purpose of
   conveying an accurate idea of their character and religious and social
   condition.

   Though most of them believe in one supremely good Spirit, whom they
   call Ke-Sha-Muneto, yet as they think he is goodness itself, they
   conclude he can do no evil, and therefore they neither fear nor offer
   to him any propitiatory sacrifice. To the evil spirit, who is called
   Manche-Muneto, they offer sacrifices, as an object of fear and dread,
   that they may appease his wrath.

   In addition to these two great and powerful beings, they believe in the
   existence of a multitude of subordinate deities, who are distinguished
   by the simple name of Muneto. These are, like the gods of the ancient
   heathen, local deities, who have their abodes in caves of the earth, in
   great waterfalls, in large and dangerous rivers and lakes, which,
   together with whatever natural phenomenon is calculated to inspire the
   mind with awe and dread, are under the control of these inferior and
   local deities. To the care of these subordinate gods the souls and
   bodies of individuals are committed, and it is a subject of much
   solicitude for each person to ascertain to which of the Munetos his
   destinies are to be consigned, that he may render to it the proper
   homage. For the purpose of acquiring this knowledge they go through a
   most painful process of fasting and other bodily austerities for
   several days in succession, and when reduced by this means to great
   physical weakness, they become perturbed in sleep, and the thoughts
   which flit through their minds in that state are interpreted in such
   way as to lead them to infer that either a bear, a deer, a snake, or
   some other animal is to be the representative of their guardian Muneto;
   and thenceforward the animal selected by the individual becomes the
   object of his superstitious reverence through all the vicissitudes of
   his future roving life. [6]

   But they have also their priests, who hold a preternatural intercourse
   with the invisible world, and interpret the will of the gods unto the
   people. These are called Paw-waws, or Conjurors. These profess to hold
   a correspondence with invisible and absent spirits, whether dead or
   alive, and teach the deluded people to believe that they can inflict
   punishment upon their enemies, even though at a great distance from
   them -- that they can, by their conjurations, cure diseases, expel
   witches and wizards, and control the power of evil spirits. These
   conjurors have their medicine-bags, with which they perform a variety
   of antic tricks, beating their tum-tum, a sort of drum, and singing
   their monotonous tunes over the sick, attempting by this means to drive
   away the evil spirit and restore the patient to health; but they more
   frequently increase the sufferings or hasten the dissolution of the
   diseased person than effect his cure.

   In addition to these ordinary priests there is another order of a
   peculiar character, -- whose business is to guard the "Council Fire."
   This is kept by each tribe in a place selected for that purpose, where
   an altar, something in the form of a rude oven, is erected, and here
   the eternal fire, as it is called, is kept perpetually burning. That it
   may not be extinguished or desecrated by rude or vulgar hands, four
   persons, two males and two females, husbands and their wives, are
   appointed as its guardians. The wives are required to cook and do the
   domestic work, while their husbands, who are destined more especially
   to the sacred duty of guarding the council fire, are likewise engaged
   in hunting and providing all needful things for the household. These
   four persons are relieved from all secular cares, that they may the
   more entirely devote themselves to the holy trust confided to them. In
   this priesthood a perpetual succession is kept up by the appointment of
   the head chief and his spouse, the former selecting the husband and the
   latter the wife of the survivor. And so sacred is the duty of guarding
   the eternal fire considered, that death is inflicted as a punishment
   upon him who violates his trust. [7]

   The custom of ridding themselves of the encumbrance of the aged and
   infirm, by putting an end to their life, is continued among these
   heathen with all its shocking barbarities. The following, as
   corroborative of the truth of this, is related on the authority of the
   Rev. William Case, whose labors among the Indians of Upper Canada, and
   intimate acquaintance with their customs, entitle him not only to
   credit, but also to the thanks of the whole Christian community. He
   says: "Many years since an aged respectable gentleman, being at the
   head of the Bay of Quinte, found an assemblage of Indians. On inquiring
   the cause, he was informed that they had assembled to perform one of
   their ceremonies. Out of respect to our informant they permitted him to
   witness the scene. They were ranged in Indian file, at the head of
   which was an aged man, and next to him a lad, his son, with a hatchet
   in his hand. They all moved slowly until they arrived at a place nearly
   dry in the ground. Here they halted. The old man kneeled down. The son
   stood for a moment, and then deliberately stepped up and struck the
   tomahawk into his father's head. He fell under the stroke, was buried,
   and the ceremony ended by drinking freely of ardent spirits." In
   justification of this inhuman conduct, they alleged that this was not a
   punishment for any crime, but merely because the old man could no
   longer follow them in their wanderings. So powerfully does the selfish
   principle predominate over filial love and obedience.

   But these superstitions are not the worst things with which the
   Christian missionary has to contend. Had these heathen been left in
   their native condition, their conversion to Christianity might be
   effected with much more ease. It is, indeed, lamentable to reflect,
   that their proximity to the white population, and their intermingling
   with them for purposes of traffic, instead of bettering their
   condition, have made it far worse, and furnished them with an argument
   against Christianity of peculiar point and force. I allude to the
   introduction of ardent spirits by mercenary traders, to the custom of
   profane swearing, to gambling, and to those diseases to which they were
   heretofore strangers. These things have debased their minds, corrupted
   their morals, impoverished their tribes, thinned their ranks, and
   hardened them against the truths of the gospel. And this is the more to
   he lamented, because these evils have been superinduced by those who
   have called themselves Christians, and professed to enjoy the
   advantages of civilization. In consequence of these things, the
   semi-civilized Indians, who skirt our settlements, and have
   intermingled with their white neighbors, are the worst, to whom the
   appellation of "miserable, half-starved Indians" most appropriately
   belongs to those in the interior, far removed from civilized life,
   being much more industrious, better clad, enjoy better health, and are
   more easily reached by gospel truth.

   This state of things renders it imperative for the missionary, on his
   first introduction to these semi-barbarians, to remove the objections
   to Christianity arising from the corrupting example of those professed
   Christians who have cheated them, made them drunk with "fire waters,"
   and turned the edge of the sword against them, until they have been
   compelled to seek a shelter from the hot pursuit of their enemies by
   plunging farther and farther into the trackless wilderness -- by
   leaving their paternal inheritances, and taking up their abodes amidst
   bears and wolves, and other wild beasts of the forests. To do this --
   to meet and obviate their objections arising out of this inhuman
   treatment, by distinguishing between a cause and its professed
   advocates, between nominal and real Christians, and by discriminating
   between pure Christianity and that corrupted form of it which has been
   made to accommodate itself to the debased passions of men -- to do this
   effectually and satisfactorily to the inquisitive mind of an Indian
   requires no little ingenuity and patient perseverance. And yet it must
   be done before an entrance can he gained to his heart by the truth. He
   must he convinced that the missionary is honest in his purpose, and
   then the latter must adapt himself, in his mode of instruction, to the
   condition, the intellect, and the moral habits of his pupil.

   Such were the difficulties existing among the Indian tribes to whom the
   gospel was sent by the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church about this time; and yet it met with a success unparalleled
   among Indian missions.

   The Wyandot Indians, among whom the reformation commenced, called by
   the French Hurons, were once a powerful nation, the most ancient
   settlers and proprietors of the country on both sides of the Detroit
   river, extending northwest as far as Mackinaw. By frequent wars,
   however, and the destructive influence of those vices contracted by
   their contiguity to the white population, they had now become greatly
   reduced in number and influence, and were at this time settled on a
   reservation of land in Upper Sandusky.

   This reservation was about nineteen miles in length from east to west,
   and twelve in breadth from north to south, containing in all nearly one
   hundred and fifty thousand acres of land. This tract, through which the
   Sandusky river winds its way, together with five miles square at the
   Big Spring, includes all the soil remaining to this once numerous and
   powerful tribe, whose dominion had extended, in their more palmy days,
   over such a vast region of country. Their chief settlement, where the
   mission was commenced, and the mission premises have been established,
   is about four hundred and seventy miles north of Columbus, the capital
   of the state of Ohio.

   As early as the year 1816, John Steward, a free man of color, born and
   raised in Powhatan county, in the State of Virginia, visited these
   people in the character of a Christian teacher. Having been brought to
   the "knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus," and become a member of
   our Church, it was deeply impressed upon his mind that it was his duty
   to travel somewhere northwest in search of some of the "lost sheep of
   the house of Israel." So strong were his convictions on this subject
   that he could have no rest in his spirit until he yielded obedience to
   what he considered the call of God. Unauthorized by any church, and in
   opposition to the advice of many of his friends, Steward took his
   departure from his "home and kindred," and continued his course until
   he arrived at Pipe Town, on the Sandusky river, where a tribe of the
   Delaware Indians dwelt. After holding a conference with these friendly
   Indians, and, through an interpreter, delivering to them a discourse on
   the subject of religion, impelled on by h is first impressions, the
   next morning he bade them an affectionate adieu, and pursued his
   journey toward Upper Sandusky, and soon arrived at the house of Mr.
   Walker, United States sub-agent, to whom Steward related his Christian
   experience, and the reasons which had induced him to come among them.
   Being finally satisfied that he was actuated by pure motives, Mr. and
   Mrs. Walker, both of whom could speak the Wyandot language, encouraged
   and assisted him much in his work. His first sermon was delivered to
   one old Indian woman. But recollecting that his Lord and Master had
   preached successfully to the woman of Samaria alone, Steward preached
   as faithfully to her as if there had been hundreds present. At his next
   appointment, "on the morrow," he had the satisfaction to find added to
   his congregation an old man. To these he addressed himself with such
   effect that they both were soon converted to the Christian faith.

   In this small way, and by these comparatively inefficient means, the
   work of reformation began among these people in the month of November,
   1816, and by the faithful labors of Steward, assisted occasionally by
   some local preachers, who took an interest in their spiritual welfare,
   before any regular missionary was pointed to take charge of them, a
   large society of converted natives had been formed, all zealous for the
   salvation of their heathen brethren. Among these were several
   influential chiefs of the nation, Between-the-logs, Mononcue, Hicks,
   and Scuteash, together with two of the interpreters, Pointer and
   Armstrong; the first of whom, Between-the-logs, was one of the chief
   counselors of the nation, a man of vigorous intellect, who soon became
   an eloquent advocate for the Christian cause; nor was Mononcue much
   inferior to him in mental strength and useful labors.

   In 1819, the very year in which the Missionary Society was formed -- a
   coincidence not unworthy of notice -- this mission was taken under the
   superintendence of the Ohio conference, which held its session that
   year in Cincinnati, August the 7th, and the Rev. James B. Finley, who
   was appointed to the Lebanon district, took the Wyandot mission under
   his care. At a quarterly meeting, held in November of this year, on Mad
   river circuit, forty-two miles from Upper Sandusky, about sixty of
   these native converts were present, among whom were the four chiefs
   above mentioned and the two interpreters. And that the reader may judge
   for himself in respect to the genuineness of the work which had been
   wrought in the hearts and lives of these people, I will insert the
   following account of the manner in which some of them related their
   Christian experience. Between-the-logs arose first in the love-feast,
   and lifting his eyes to heaven, streaming with tears of penitence and
   gratitude, said: --

   "My dear brethren, I am happy this morning that the Great Spirit has
   permitted us to assemble here for so good a purpose as to worship him,
   and to strengthen the cords of love and friendship. This is the first
   meeting of the kind which has been held for us, and now, my dear
   brethren, I am happy that we, who have been so long time apart, and
   enemies to one another, are come together as brothers, at which our
   Great Father is well pleased. For my part, I have been a very wicked
   man, and have committed many great sins against the Good Spirit, was
   addicted to drinking whisky and many evils: but I thank my good God
   that I am yet alive, and that he has most perfectly opened my eyes by
   his ministers and the good book to see these evils, and has given me
   help to forsake them and turn away from them. Now I feel peace in my
   heart with God and all men; but I feel just like a little child
   beginning to walk; sometimes very weak, and almost ready to give up;
   then I pray, and my Great Father hears me, and gives me the blessing;
   then I feel strong and happy; then I walk again; so sometimes up and
   sometimes down. I want you all to pray for me, that I may never sin any
   more, but always live happy and die happy. Then I shall meet you all in
   our Great Father's house above, and be happy for ever.' This speech was
   attended with great power to the hearts of the people.

   "The next who arose was Hicks, who had become a most temperate and
   zealous advocate for the Christian religion. His speech was not
   interpreted entire; but after expressing his gratitude to God for what
   he then felt, and hoped to enjoy, he exhorted his Indian brethren to be
   much engaged for a blessing, and enforced his exhortation in the
   following manner: -- When I was a boy, my parents used to send me on
   errands, and sometimes I saw so many new things to attract my
   attention, I would say, By and by I will ask, until I would forget what
   I was sent for, and have to go home without it. So it may be with you.
   You have come here to get a blessing, but if you do not ask for it you
   will have to go home without it, and the wicked Indians will laugh at
   you for coming so far for nothing. Now seek, now ask, and if you get
   the blessing you will be happy, and go home light, and then be strong
   to resist evil and to do good.' He concluded by imploring a blessing
   upon his brethren.

   "Scuteash next arose, and, with a smiling and serene countenance, said,
   I have been a great sinner, and such a drunkard as made me commit many
   great sins, and the Great Spirit was very mad with me, so that in here
   -- pointing to his breast -- always sick -- no sleep -- no eat -- walk
   -- walk--drink whisky. Then I pray to the Great Spirit to help me to
   quit getting drunk, and to forgive me all my sins; and God did do
   something for me -- I do not know from whence it comes nor where it
   goes, but it came all over me--Here he cried out, Waugh! Waugh!' as if
   shocked with electricity -- Now me no more sick. Me sleep, eat, and no
   more get drunk -- no more drink whisky -- no more bad man. Me cry -- me
   meet you all in our Great Father's house, and be happy for ever.'

   At the conclusion of the love-feast there were not less than three
   hundred white people assembled from the neighboring frontier
   settlements, to whom Mr. Finley preached with great effect. The
   manifest attention in the appearance and general deportment of the
   Indian converts, together with the preaching, had a most salutary
   effect upon the audience.

   "The next evening, at the earnest request of the natives, the meeting
   was resumed. After an exhortation from Mr. Finley, Mononcue arose and
   exhorted his brethren to look for the blessing they sought now. He then
   addressed the white brethren as follows: --

   "Fathers and brethren, I am happy this night before the Great Spirit
   that made all men, both red, white, and black, that he has favored us
   with good weather for our meeting, and brought us together that we may
   help one another to get good and do good. The Great Spirit has taught
   you and us both in one thing, that we should love one another, and fear
   and obey him. Us Indians he has taught by his Spirit; and you, white
   men, he has taught by your good book, which is all one. But your book
   teaches you, and us by you, more plainly than we were taught before,
   what is for our good. To be sure we served our Great Father sincerely,
   (before we were told by the good book the way,) by our feasts, rattles,
   and sacrifices, and dances, which we now see were not all right. Now
   some of our nation are trying to do better; but we have many
   hindrances, some of which I mean to tell. The white men tell us they
   love us, and we believe some do, and wish us well; but a great many do
   not, for they will bring us whisky, which has been the ruin of our
   people. I can compare whisky to nothing but the devil; for it brings
   with it all kinds of evil -- it destroys our happiness; it makes
   Indians poor; strips our squaws and children of their clothes and food;
   makes us lie, steal, and kill one another. All these and many other
   evils it brings among us; therefore you ought not to bring it among us.
   Now you white people make it, you know its strength and use, Indians do
   not. Now this whisky is a curse to yourselves why not quit making it?
   This is one argument used by wicked Indians against the good book; If
   it is so good; why do not white men all do good? Another hindrance is,
   white men cheat Indians, take away their money and skins for nothing.
   Now you tell us your good book forbids all this; why not then do what
   it tells you? then Indians do right too. Again, you say our Great
   Father loves all men, white, black, and red men, that do right; then
   why do you look at Indians as below you, and treat them as if they were
   not brothers? Does your good book tell you so? I am sure it does not.
   Now, brothers, let us all do right; then our Great Father will be
   pleased, and will make us happy in this world, and when we die then we
   shall all live together in his house above, and always be happy.'"

   At the Ohio conference, which was held this year, 1820, in Chillicothe,
   the chiefs of the Wyandots presented a petition to the conference for a
   regular missionary to be appointed over them. It will doubtless be both
   pleasing and edifying to the reader to know the orderly method by which
   the whole affair of preparing and presenting this petition was
   conducted, as it will show that these people were governed by the
   principles of democracy in coming to a final determination of any
   important question, while the executive authority was confided to their
   chief men. The following is Mr. Finley's' account of this transaction:
   --

   "Sunday, 16th July, in the Wyandot council house, Upper Sandusky, at
   the close of public worship, was my last address to the Wyandots by the
   interpreter. My friends, and you chiefs and speakers in particular, I
   have one word more to say; I expect to meet our good old chiefs and
   fathers in the church at Chillicothe before I come to see you again,
   and they will ask me how you come on in serving the Lord, and if you
   want them to keep sending you preachers any longer, to tell you the
   good word, or if you have any choice in preachers to come and teach
   you.'

   "The answer. -- Our chiefs are not all here, and we must have all our
   chiefs and queens together, and they must all speak their minds, and
   then we will let the old father know.'

   "They appointed to meet me at Negro town on Wednesday evening, on my
   return from Seneca town; and, having returned, found them assembled and
   prepared to answer. On entering in among them a seat was set in the
   midst of the room, and I requested to take the seat, which I declined;
   but took my seat in their circle against the wall, and directed the
   interpreter to take the middle seat, which was done. After a short
   silence I spoke. Dear friends and brothers, I am thankful to find you
   all here, and am now prepared to hear your answer.'

   "Mononcue, chairman and speaker for them all, answered: --

   "We let our old father know that we have put the question round which
   was proposed on Sunday evening in the council house, and our queens
   give their answer first, saying,

   "We thank the old father for coming to see us so often, and speaking
   the good word to us, and we want him to keep coming and never forsake
   us; and we let him know that we love this religion too well to give it
   up while we live, for we think it will go bad with our people if they
   quit this religion; and we want our good brother Steward to stay always
   among us, and our brother Jonathan too, and to help us along as they
   have done. Next we let the old father know what our head chiefs and the
   others have to say. They are willing that the gospel word should be
   continued among them, and they will try to do good themselves and help
   others to do so too; but as for the other things that are mentioned,
   they say, We give it all over to our speakers; just what they say we
   agree to; they know better about these things than we do, and they may
   let the old father know their mind.'

   "The speakers reply for themselves: --

   "We thank the fathers in conference for sending us preachers to help
   our brother Steward, and we desire the old father to keep coming at
   least another year when his year is out; and we want our brother
   Armstrong to come as often as he can, and our brothers Steward and
   Jonathan to stay among us and help us as they have done; and we hope
   our good fathers will not give us up because so many of our people are
   wicked and do wrong, for we believe some white men are wicked yet, that
   had the good word preached to them longer than our people; and our
   great heavenly Father has had long patience with us all; and we let the
   old father know that we, the speakers, will not give over speaking and
   telling our people to live in the right way; and if any of us do wrong
   we will still try to help him right, and let none go wrong; and we will
   try to make our head chiefs and all our people better, and we are one
   in voice with our queens, and we all join in giving thanks to our good
   fathers that care for our souls, and are willing to help our people;
   and we want them all to pray for us, and we will pray for them, and we
   hope our great heavenly Father will bless us all, and this is the
   last.'"

   Their request was granted, and Moses Hinkle, senior, was appointed a
   missionary to Upper Sandusky. Being aided and encouraged by so many
   influential chiefs, and others of the tribe who had embraced the
   Christian faith, the missionary entered upon his work with a fair
   prospect of success; nor was he disappointed in his expectations,
   though it required much labor and skill to bring them into gospel
   order, according to our disciplinary regulations.

   While these prospects were looming up before us in this and some other
   places, the Church in the city of New York was convulsed by an eruption
   which had been secretly working, and sometimes venting itself in low
   murmurings and disputings, for a considerable time before it broke
   forth in the manner now to be described. It would doubtless be tedious,
   and probably uninteresting to the reader, for me to enter into a minute
   detail of all the circumstances which led finally to a secession of a
   traveling preacher and upward of three hundred members, including three
   trustees and quite a number of class-leaders.

   In contests of this character there is generally more or less of blame
   on both sides in respect to the manner in which the controversy is
   conducted, while only one can be right in regard to the main principle
   contended for, or as it respects the measures and things to be
   sustained or sacrificed. And that in the discussions which arose on the
   present occasion there were hasty expressions and precipitate measures
   on the one side as well as the other, I have good reason to know, while
   I am equally well convinced that the seceders themselves had no just
   cause for their complaints, and the means which they employed to
   accomplish their ends.

   The origin of the difficulty may be traced to the rebuilding of John
   Street church, in the year 1817, although long prior to this there had
   appeared a jealousy between the uptown and downtown people, and more
   particularly between the east and west portions of the city. But the
   manner in which this church was re-edified, being a little more neat
   and costly than the other churches in the city, furnished a plausible
   opportunity, for those who seemed to want one, to censure the conduct
   of the trustees and those preachers who favored their plan of building,
   and thus the spirit of discontent among the members of the Church was
   much increased. Unhappily for the peace of the Church, the malcontents
   were strengthened in their opposition at the first by at least one
   preacher, who made no secret of his dissatisfaction at the measures
   which had been pursued in relation to the John Street church, and other
   matters connected with the administration of discipline.

   These things continued to distract the councils of the Church, and to
   disturb its peace and harmony more and more, until the session of the
   New York conference in 1820, when the conference adopted measures to
   remove, if possible, the source of the difficulties, by advising our
   people to petition the state legislature for such an act of
   incorporation as should "recognize the peculiarities of our form of
   church government," and thereby protect the administrators of
   discipline in their ecclesiastical rights and privileges. Though the
   conference meant nothing more than the removal of legal barriers, which
   they then thought existed, out of the way, yet the dissatisfied party
   seized hold of this circumstance with peculiar avidity, and made it
   subserve their purposes by raising the cry of "legal establishment," an
   "attempt to coerce the people by civil laws," &c., &c. Though all this
   was but idle gossip, yet it had its effect in raising a prejudice in
   the minds of many sincere members of our Church, and induced them to
   believe that their preachers were adopting measures to enslave them, or
   to deprive them of their just rights and privileges.

   It is believed that the measures of the conference, though well meant,
   were unnecessary, even for the attainment of the end proposed, as
   subsequent experience has proved that the constitutions, both of the
   general and state governments, amply secure to all denominations the
   full enjoyment of all their peculiarities, and the free and
   unrestrained exercise of their disciplinary regulations, provided they
   behave as peaceable citizens, and do not infract any law of the land.
   This principle has been settled by the highest tribunals of justice,
   and therefore no special act is necessary to remove any legal barrier
   out of the way of the exercise of discipline, provided as above,
   because all such barriers, did they exist, are unconstitutional, and
   are therefore null and void.

   But this act of the New York conference, perfectly innocent in itself,
   and which was never carried into effect, furnished a plausible pretext
   to the discontented party, and was used with admirable effect in
   raising a prejudice against the constituted authorities of the Church.
   It finally ended, as before remarked, in the secession of a preacher,
   William M. Stillwell, and about three hundred members of the Church,
   some of whom were men of long standing and considerable influence. They
   formed themselves into an independent congregation, adopting the
   substance of our general rules for their government, and our doctrines
   as articles of faith, professing at the same time an attachment to the
   itinerating mode of spreading the gospel, and, drawing others after
   them in some portions of the country, formed an annual conference, made
   up chiefly -- for I believe no traveling preacher joined them except
   Stillwell -- of local preachers, and those who had been exhorters in
   our Church. Their itinerancy, however; was of short duration, for those
   who seceded in the city of New York soon settled down upon the
   Congregational plan of church government, allowing even the females a
   voice in all matters of administration.

   As it will not be necessary to advert to these things again, except
   incidentally, it is proper to remark here, that most of those who left
   us at that time have since returned to the church of their first love.
   Having sufficiently tested the quality of the "new wine" to find it
   unsavory, and becoming restive under their new regimen, they made
   application to be restored to the privilege of drinking again the "old
   wine," and to the government from which they had expatriated
   themselves. Some afterward joined the "Reformer," improperly so called,
   and a few only of those who seceded remain attached to Stillwell. Two
   out of the three trustees who left us, most of the class-leaders,
   together with their members, have been, at their own request, restored
   to their former fellowship, in a way equally satisfactory to all
   concerned. Mr. Stillwell, however, remains over a congregation, made up
   chiefly of those who have been gathered in since the secession, and, so
   far as they may promote "the common salvation," we wish them success.

   Notwithstanding these difficulties occurred in the city of New York and
   a few other places which were affected by these movements, by which
   many a sincere heart was made to palpitate with sorrow, and some of our
   ministers to suffer a temporary reproach, the work of God was generally
   prosperous, and great peace reigned among those who remained unmoved in
   the city of New York.

   It was no small satisfaction to the projectors and friends of our
   Missionary Society to find that their labors were duly appreciated by
   their brethren, and that the spirit of missions was gradually diffusing
   itself throughout our ranks, exerting in its course a hallowing
   influence in the Church, and calling forth a spirit of liberality
   highly creditable to all concerned. Many of the annual conferences
   formed themselves into auxiliary societies, and adopted energetic
   measures to establish branches throughout their bounds, with a view to
   supply the pecuniary means needful to support those men of God who
   volunteered their services for the salvation of men. Numerous
   testimonies in favor of these measures, sent to the managers to cheer
   them on the way, might easily be adduced; but I shall content myself
   with inserting the following from the Rev. Thomas L. Douglass, of the
   Tennessee conference: --

   "The plan," he remarks, "proposed in the Address of the Missionary
   Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, places things on very
   advantageous ground. The men to be aided and sanctioned as missionaries
   are to be approved by our annual conferences, and to act under the
   direction of our bishops. Men who, renouncing ease and worldly
   prospects, devoted to God and his Church, and qualified for the divine
   work in which they are engaged, will spread the word of life; and by
   uniting precept with example they will plant the standard of Immanuel,
   and diffuse light to thousands in regions where darkness now reigns. O!
   could our venerable father, Bishop Asbury, the apostle of America, have
   witnessed such a plan matured and carried into operation by his sons in
   the gospel, his great soul must have felt such rapture, that, like
   Simeon, he would have exclaimed, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant
   depart in peace! Admirable system! The strength of Jehovah must be felt
   by the powers of darkness in the operation of such a plan.

   "I think the publication of the Methodist Magazine and the
   establishment of the Missionary Society, both engrafted on the old
   itinerant missionary plan, are calculated to impart such energy and
   spirit to the whole connection, that we shall not only keep up the life
   and power of religion where it is already planted, but renewed exertion
   and unequaled success, since the apostolic age, in saving souls from
   death, will be the resulting consequences.

   "Nashville is certainly the most central as well as the most populous
   town within the limits of this conference, and therefore ought to be
   the place for the location of an auxiliary society, which I shall use
   my endeavors to establish as soon as possible."

   Events have verified the truth of these anticipations respecting the
   blessed results of this society. An enlightened zeal distinguished the
   conduct of those who entered the most heartily into the missionary
   work, and the spirit of revival pervaded many portions of the Church
   during this and succeeding years. An auxiliary missionary society had
   been formed in Lynn, Mass., and the Rev. J. A. Merrill, who was
   appointed by the bishop as a missionary in the bounds of the New
   England conference, went to the upper Coos, along the upper waters of
   the Connecticut river, a tract of country almost entirely destitute of
   the gospel. God accompanied his labors with the energies of the Holy
   Spirit, so that many sinners were awakened and brought to the knowledge
   of the truth. He extended his labors into Vermont, some parts of New
   Hampshire, and Maine, and everywhere found a people eager to hear the
   word. The following extract from one of his letters will show the
   extent and effect of his labors: --

   "Since my last communication I have made two visits into the upper Coos
   country, and am happy to state that the prospect still brightens. In
   Lunenburgh there is a gracious work of religion. I have attended a
   number of meetings in that place, and the power of God was evidently
   manifested among the people. The tears and sighs of mourners clearly
   discovered that the word was not delivered in vain. At one time nearly
   the whole assembly rose and requested prayers, and after the
   congregation was dismissed a number of mourning and weeping souls
   tarried, and still desired we should pray for them. They readily
   prostrated themselves at the foot of the cross, while our prayers were
   offered to God in their behalf. Several have professed faith in the
   Lord Jesus, and others are still struggling for deliverance.

   "There is a good work in the Congregational society in this town. At a
   meeting not long since, the preacher, after giving an invitation to the
   people to rise to be prayed for, and counting forty, urged the
   importance of their kneeling, from the example of Christ and the
   apostles; he then kneeled, and was joined in this Scriptural and
   rational act by nearly all the congregation.

   "About one hundred have been added to the societies on Stratford
   circuit since the last conference, and perhaps more than that number on
   Landaff circuit.

   "I have made a tour of about five weeks into Maine; preached in the
   towns of Shelbourn, Rumford, Bethel, Livermore, Augusta, Sidney,
   Gardner, Litchfield, and Vienna. In some of these towns I preached four
   and five times, and have reason to think the labor will not be lost.
   The prospect in several towns is good; -- in Vienna about sixty have
   experienced religion of late, and the attention in most of these places
   is considerable.

   "You observe in your letter that several wished to know how many miles
   I have traveled and how many sermons I have preached since my
   appointment. I am not much in favor of this practice, generally; but as
   it is the wish of my friends, and has been a practice among
   missionaries, I shall here state, for the satisfaction of the society,
   that I have visited and preached in seventy towns, traveled three
   thousand six hundred and seventy miles, (in about eight months,) and
   preached two hundred and forty sermons; but how many families I have
   visited I cannot tell."

   In the town of Bristol, R. I., there was a gracious work of God. The
   following particulars respecting the commencement and progress of
   Methodism in this place will doubtless be interesting to the reader.
   About the year 1791 a sea captain, a citizen of Bristol, was brought to
   the saving knowledge of the truth under Methodist preaching in the city
   of New York. On his return to his native place he made known to some of
   his neighbors what God had done for his soul. Though many who heard
   these things treated them with contempt, others believed his testimony
   and received it with joy. Being encouraged by these, the captain, whose
   heart burned with love to the souls of his fellowmen, invited the
   Methodist preachers to visit Bristol; and though much opposition was
   manifested by some, yet others received the word with joyful and
   believing hearts, and a society was soon formed, consisting of eighteen
   persons. This was the beginning of Methodism in that place, and the
   society gradually increased in numbers and strength, so that in 1805
   they were enabled to build a commodious house of worship. In 1812,
   under a powerful revival of religion, about one hundred were added to
   their number. This year, 1820, they were favored with another
   outpouring of the Spirit, during which not less than one hundred and
   fifty gave evidence of a work of regenerating grace, so that the whole
   number of Church members was four hundred and eight, including
   twenty-two colored.

   In Provincetown, Massachusetts, also, there was a remarkable work of
   God; -- so powerful was it in its effects, and so rapid in its
   progress, that it changed the entire moral aspect of the place. As this
   work began while many of the men were absent at sea -- the inhabitants
   living chiefly by fishing -- on their return they were astonished at
   the change which had taken place; but they soon became convinced that
   it was the power of God which had produced the reformation, and they
   also were soon made "partakers of like precious faith," whole families
   rejoicing together "for the consolation." About one hundred and forty
   in this little town were brought to God during this revival.

   Chillicothe, Ohio, was also favored with manifest displays of the power
   and grace of God. In 1819 there had been a revival here which
   eventuated in the addition of three hundred and twenty to the Church.
   This year the work continued with increasing power, and, among others,
   the man who had been employed in finishing their house of worship,
   together with all his family, and all the hands employed on the house,
   were made partakers of the grace of life.

   Many other places, too numerous to mention, were blessed with revivals,
   so that it may be said the Church very generally was in a prosperous
   condition.

   Thirty-five preachers were located this year, fifteen were returned
   supernumerary, and forty-two superannuated, and three had been
   expelled. Two, John T. Brame and George Burnet, had died in the Lord.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This Year: 219,332; Last Year: 201,750;
   Increase: 17,582 -- Colored This Year: 40,558; Last Year: 39,174;
   Increase: 1,384 -- Total This Year: 259,890 [8] ; Last Year: 240,924 --
   Increase: 18,966 -- Preachers This Year: 896; Last Year: 812; Increase:
   84.

  1821

   The mission which had been commenced among the Wyandots continued to
   prosper, and the reports of its success had a most happy influence on
   the cause of religion generally. This year the Rev. James B. Finley was
   appointed to the superintendence of this mission. In addition to
   preaching the gospel to the adult Indians, he was instructed to
   establish a school for the education of the children, both in letters
   and in domestic economy -- to teach the boys the art of agriculture,
   and the girls to sew, spin, and knit, and all the duties of the
   household.

   It is a coincidence worthy of notice, that about the time this good
   work commenced among the natives of our forests, the government of the
   United States made an appropriation of ten thousand dollars annually
   for the support of native schools, in which it was ordered that the
   children should he taught the arts of civilized life, as well as to
   read, write, and keep accounts. This annuity was to be divided among
   the several schools which might be established among the aboriginal
   tribes by missionary societies, and the Wyandot school received its
   quota. To accomplish his object Mr. Finley commenced building a house,
   which might serve the double purpose of a house of worship and for
   teaching the children, and likewise inclosed a large farm, the land
   having been granted by the chiefs to the mission, on which he labored
   with his own hands, for the purpose of setting an example to the
   Indians, that they might habituate themselves to an agricultural life.
   These movements had a salutary effect upon their physical and moral
   condition.

   The converted natives were formed into classes, and the chiefs who
   embraced Christianity were appointed leaders. At the first offer that
   was made to receive them into class twenty-three came forward, with
   tears of mingled sorrow and joy, desiring to become members of the
   Christian church, while others stood trembling and weeping, crying
   aloud, "O, Shasus, Ta-men-tare!" that is, "O, Jesus, take pity on us!"
   In this way the good work went on during the year.

   With a view to send the gospel to the Creek Indians, who inhabited a
   tract of country lying within the bounds of the states of Georgia and
   Alabama, then under the chieftainship of McIntosh, the celebrated
   half-breed warrior, the Rev. William Capers undertook a tour through
   the state of Georgia, to ascertain the feelings of its citizens toward
   an attempt to establish a mission among that tribe of Indians. He was
   favorably received by the people generally, and the proposed mission
   was viewed with a friendly eye. He visited and preached in the most
   populous towns and villages in the state, and made collections for the
   support of the contemplated mission, which was begun the succeeding
   year.

   The feelings of the managers of the Missionary Society, in view of what
   God had already done through their instrumentality, may be seen by the
   following extract from their third annual report: --

   "It is now only about three years since this society commenced its
   operations. Combining so large a field of labor, and comprehending in
   its plans so large a circle, as the whole of the Methodist conferences
   in the United States, it was but reasonable to expect that its progress
   would be slow; but it has been sure. Time and patient perseverance are
   necessary to set so many wheels in motion, to communicate life and
   vigor to each, and so to direct the movements of the whole as to
   produce a simultaneous and harmonious co-operation. But, blessed be the
   God of missions! the God of Wesley and Whitefield -- those eminent
   missionaries of the old world -- who inspired them with sufficient
   energy to set the mighty machine in motion -- of Asbury and Coke, who
   gave it such an impulse in the new world -- blessed be his holy name
   for ever, that he hath so far given success to the experiment. Already
   the impulse is felt more or less strongly from the center to the
   circumference of our connection. The mustard-seed first s own about
   three years since has taken deep root, has extended its branches, and
   many are reposing under their shadow. Young branches are shooting forth
   in various directions, and, instead of exhausting the strength of the
   parent stock, are daily adding to its growth and stability. As you have
   already heard, the heathen tribes of our wilderness are partaking of
   its fruits.

   "The time, indeed, is not far distant, when every man who shall have
   engaged in this godlike enterprise will esteem it as the happiest
   period of his existence, the highest honor ever conferred upon him,
   when he embarked in the cause of missions. The loiterers, those who
   have looked on with cold indifference, and with envious eye have waited
   the doubtful result, will stand abashed, filled with confusion at their
   own supineness; and will, if their zeal for God be not quite
   extinguished, petition the privilege to redeem their lost time, by
   being permitted, at last, to participate in the grand work of
   conquering the world by the power of truth."

   The work of God was generally prosperous throughout the bounds of the
   several annual conferences, notwithstanding a spirit of disaffection
   was manifesting itself in some places among a few restless spirits.
   Through the agency of camp meetings in some parts of South Carolina
   much good was done, and a new circuit which was formed in the
   neighborhood of Bush river was blessed with an encouraging revival,
   under the labors of R. L. Edwards. An effort was also made to carry the
   gospel into a new field in the southwest, in what was called Jackson's
   Purchase, which embraced portions of the states of Kentucky and
   Tennessee, and Lewis Garrett and Hezekiah Holland were appointed to
   this service. That they were successful in their labors is evident from
   the fact, that there were returned on the Minutes for 1822 one hundred
   and forty-two whites and thirteen colored.

   In the Nashville district also, through the agency of camp meetings,
   there were extensive revivals of religion throughout nearly all the
   circuits within the district, so much so that the net increase, after
   deducting expulsions, deaths, and removals, was one thousand three
   hundred and five members. The writer of this account, the Rev. Thomas
   L. Douglass, thus concludes his remarks: --

   "The character of this revival is the least mixed with what are called
   irregularities or extravagances of any that I ever saw. We have had
   nothing of what is called the jerks, or dance, among us. The work of
   conviction in the hearts of sinners has been regular, powerful, and
   deep; their conversion, or deliverance from sin and guilt, clear and
   bright; and their rejoicings Scriptural and rational. I think fully
   half of those who have been the subjects of the work are young men, and
   heads of families; many of them among the most respectable in the
   country, men of education, men of talents. We anticipate help and
   usefulness from some of them in the Lord's vineyard. Upon the whole, it
   is the greatest work, the most blessed revival, I ever saw. The whole
   country, in some places, seems like bowing to our Immanuel; religion
   meets with very little that can be called opposition; and many who
   neither profess nor appear to have any desire to get religion
   themselves, manifest an uncommon degree of solicitude that others
   should obtain it, and express a high satisfaction at seeing the work
   prosper. May the Lord continue to pour out his Spirit, and may the
   hallowed fire spread, until all the inhabitants of the earth shall
   rejoice in his salvation! To God be all the glory! Pray for us, dear
   brethren, that this year may be as the past, and much more abundantly.
   We look for it and expect it. The district is well supplied with
   preachers, men of talents, men of zeal, and in the spirit of the work.
   May the Lord bless their labors!"

   In Carter's Valley circuit, Holston conference, there were added,
   during a revival that year, not less than three hundred to the Church.

   In Pittsburgh, Pa., the work of reformation had been going forward
   without interruption for about eighteen months, during which time not
   less than five hundred had been added to the Church, of whom about two
   hundred and sixty had been received in the course of six months. The
   writer of this account of the work of God in Pittsburgh, the Rev.
   Samuel Davis, who was at that time stationed there, closes his
   narrative in following words: --

   "To those who have been conversant with the history of Methodism in
   this place from its rise, and who, with lively interest, have marked
   its progress down to the present, the retrospect must afford matter for
   the liveliest feelings of gratitude to God. Yea, when they look back
   but a few years, and compare what they then were with what they are
   now, their souls, in pleasing astonishment, must cry out, What hath the
   Lord wrought!' When they consider that, about ten or twelve years ago,
   an apartment in a private house was sufficient to contain the society,
   and all who chose to assemble with them to hear the word preached; and
   that now that little society has swelled to a church of near seven
   hundred members, possessing two meeting-houses, (one of which is
   large,) which are well filled, on sabbath evenings especially, with
   serious and attentive hearers -- a review of these circumstances
   constrains them to acknowledge that it is indeed the Lord's doings, and
   marvelous in their eyes,' -- that they who were not a people should
   become the people of the Lord.' The Lord reigneth! Let the earth
   rejoice.'"

   In some portions of North Carolina the camp meetings were rendered a
   great blessing to the people. In the town of Hillsborough, where the
   Methodists had been but little known, having only two Church members in
   the place, there was a society of forty raised up as the fruit of one
   of these meetings, and they immediately adopted measures for erecting a
   house of worship, much to the gratification of the people of
   Hillsborough. Other places shared largely in the blessed effects of
   these revivals, and upward of three hundred were added to the several
   societies in that region of country, besides a number who connected
   themselves with other denominations.

   In the more northern conferences also the work of God was prosperous.
   In the New Hampshire district, in New Haven, Conn., Providence, R. I.,
   New London district, Wellfleet, New Windsor, and Rhinebeck circuits,
   the Lord poured out his Spirit, and blessed the labor of his servants
   in the conversion of many sinners and the sanctification of believers.

   In 1819 Alabama was admitted as a state into the American confederacy.
   It had been filling up, like the other territories in the west and
   southwest, with inhabitants from Europe and the older states in the
   Union, most of whom were destitute of the ordinances of Christianity.
   Into this country the Methodist itinerants had penetrated, and
   succeeded in forming circuits and establishing societies among the
   scattered population. This year, as the following account will show,
   there were encouraging revivals of religion in many places in that part
   of the country. The presiding elder, the Rev. Thomas Griffin, writes as
   follows: --

   "At a camp meeting held on the 6th of July last, on Pearl river, a few
   miles from Monticello, the congregation was large and attentive, many
   were awakened to a sense of their need of Christ, and five or six gave
   evidence of a change of heart.

   "On the 20th we held another meeting on the river Chickasawhay, about
   fifty miles from the town of Mobile, where we have a large, flourishing
   society. There were two traveling and four local preachers, and one
   Presbyterian minister at this meeting. On Friday and Saturday the Lord
   favored us with a solemn sense of his presence. Sinners were struck
   with awe, and stood with respectful silence, while believers rejoiced
   in God their Saviour. On sabbath we administered the Lord's supper. All
   were solemn as night. The word of God was heard with great attention,
   and I believe much good was done. About ten professed justifying grace.

   "On the 27th of July we held another meeting, about thirty miles from
   St. Stephen's, near the Tombeckbee and Alabama rivers. Though the
   principal part of the people were irreligious, yet they behaved with
   great order and decorum, and five or six professed to be converted.

   "On the 2d of August we commenced a camp meeting on the banks of the
   Alabama river, thirty miles below the town of Cahawba the seat of
   government for this state. From the paucity of the inhabitants, and the
   affliction many were suffering from a prevailing fever, there were not
   many that attended this meeting. Some disorder was witnessed; but He
   that commanded the boisterous winds to be still appeared in our behalf,
   and before the exercises closed some were brought, as we have reason to
   believe, to the knowledge of the truth.

   "August 10th another meeting began, thirty miles above Cahawba, on the
   bank of the above-mentioned river. A numerous concourse of people
   attended, and much good was done. On Tuesday morning I requested all
   who had obtained an evidence of their conversion to God to come forward
   to the altar, when thirty-seven presented themselves. The last two
   meetings were held in a forest, and the Indians were fishing in the
   river while we were preaching and praying; the bears were ravaging the
   cornfields, and the wolf and tiger were howling and screaming in the
   very woods in the neighborhood of our meeting.

   "These accounts may seem unimportant to those who are accustomed to
   more numerous congregations, and who have the privilege of assembling
   in convenient houses; but to us, who are struggling with many
   difficulties in this newly settled country, it is highly gratifying,
   and fills us with a pleasing hope of yet seeing the desert blossom as
   the rose."

   Fifty preachers were located this year, twenty-two returned
   supernumerary, fifty-five superannuated, and five expelled. Three,
   Daniel Ireland, William M. Stillwell, and William Barton, had
   withdrawn, the last of whom joined the Protestant Episcopal Church.
   Six, namely, Samuel Parker, Charles Dickinson, Archibald Robinson, John
   Robertson, Richard Emory, and Apheus Davis, had finished their course
   in peace.

   Samuel Parker was eminently useful in his day and generation. He was a
   native of New Jersey, born in 1774, of poor parents. At the age of
   fourteen he was brought from darkness to light, and became a member of
   the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1805 he entered the traveling
   ministry, and was appointed to labor in the western country. It soon
   appeared that God was with him. By his deep devotion to the work of
   God, and his eminent talents as a preacher of righteousness, he
   acquired the confidence of his brethren, and commanded the respect of
   the community generally. In 1815 he was appointed the presiding elder
   of the Miami district, and from thence, in the next year, was
   transferred to the Kentucky district, in which he continued four years.
   In this station he was greatly blessed in his labors, during which time
   he was married to Miss Oletha Tilton.

   Being called by the bishop to fill an important post in the bounds of
   the Mississippi conference, though his health was evidently declining,
   he consented to be transferred to that more distant field of labor. He
   soon, however, sunk under the influence of disease, and on the 20th of
   December, 1819, he died in peace.

   The Rev. Samuel Parker was a man of deep experience, of fervent piety,
   of stern integrity, and possessed talents of the most useful character
   as a minister of Jesus Christ. His method of preaching was well
   calculated to soothe the mind of the believer by the sweet and rich
   promises of the gospel, as well as to inspire hope and faith in the
   broken-hearted, penitent sinner. And his general deportment as a
   Christian minister, among his brethren and the people of his charge,
   inspired such confidence in his wisdom and the purity of his motives as
   gave him a powerful influence over others, and he exerted it at all
   times for their present and future welfare. Had he lived to "threescore
   years and ten," no doubt he would have ranked among the first ministers
   in the Methodist Episcopal Church; but that God who "seeth the end from
   the beginning" saw fit to call him in the prime of life from the
   militant to the church triumphant, where he rests from his labors, and
   his works do follow him.

   Of the others whose death is recorded, it is said that they also filled
   up the measure of their days in usefulness, and ended their lives in
   the full hope of the gospel.

  1822

   This year two more Indian missions were commenced, one among the
   Mohawks in Upper Canada, and the other among the Creeks, called the
   Asbury mission. As the latter, after much expense and labor, failed in
   the accomplishment of its objects, perhaps it may be as well to give
   the history of its commencement, progress, and termination, once for
   all, in this place.

   As before stated, the charge of this mission was confided, by Bishop
   McKendree, to the Rev. William Capers, of the South Carolina
   conference. After traveling extensively through the state of Georgia,
   endeavoring to awaken the missionary spirit, and collect funds to
   defray the expense for an outfit of the mission, in the month of August
   of this year, in company with Colonel Richard Blount, a pious and
   intelligent member of our Church, he arrived at the Creek agency, on
   Flint river. After witnessing some debasing scenes of amusement among
   the females, and one of those Indian plays which was conducted with a
   rude display of Indian dexterity, and daring feats of ferocious
   gallantry, he obtained an introduction to General McIntosh, the
   principal man of the nation. As an instance of the lordly bearing of
   this chief, who prided himself for having fought the battles of his
   country, as a general in the ranks of the Indian allies, under the
   command of the hero of New Orleans, [9] may be mentioned his refusing
   to converse with Mr. Capers, though he perfectly understood the English
   language, only through the medium of an interpreter, assuming, in the
   mean time, all the etiquette of a stately prince in the reception of an
   ambassador.

   The interview resulted in an agreement between the parties for the
   establishment of a mission, with liberty to use so much land only as
   should be found necessary to raise provision for the mission family,
   and for building the needful houses; and the Rev. Isaac Hill, an old,
   tried, experienced minister was appointed in charge of the mission. But
   notwithstanding the favorable beginning of this laudable attempt to
   convey the blessings of the gospel to these heathen, so long neglected
   by the Christian church, difficulties of a formidable character soon
   made their appearance. Some of the chiefs, who were not present at the
   council when the above agreement was ratified, raised objections
   against the enterprise, and thus created so many jarring sentiments in
   the nation, that for a time it was doubted, among the friends of the
   cause, whether it was best to continue the effort. It was, however,
   continued. A school was opened for the instruction of the children, but
   the missionary was forbidden, through the influence of the opposing
   chiefs, to preach the gospel to the adult Indians. It was also strongly
   suspected that the United States agent lent the weight of his influence
   against the prosecution of the mission, though an investigation of his
   conduct resulted in his justification by the government of the United
   States. And the following extract from the letter of instructions which
   was sent to the Indian agent will show that the officers of the
   government took a lively interest in the objects of this mission. The
   secretary of war, the Honorable John C. Calhoun, after expressing his
   regret that any difficulties should have arisen between the
   missionaries and Colonel Crowell, the Indian agent, expresses himself
   in the following language: --

   "The president takes a deep interest in the success of every effort,
   the object of which is to improve the condition of the Indians, and
   desires that every aid be furnished by the Indian agents in advancing
   so important an object; and he trusts that your conduct will be such as
   to avoid the possibility of complaint on the part of those who are
   engaged in this benevolent work.

   "You will give a decided countenance and support to the Methodist
   mission, as well as to any other society that may choose to direct its
   efforts to improve the condition of the Creek Indians. It is not
   conceived that they can have any just cause of apprehension against the
   privilege of preaching the gospel among them; and you will use a
   decided influence with them to reconcile them to its exercise on the
   part of the mission. The department feels confident that, by proper
   efforts on your part, you may secure to the mission the right of
   preaching among the Indians, which is deemed to be so essentially
   connected with the objects of the society."

   Notwithstanding this favorable regard toward the mission by the
   government of the United States, and the persevering efforts of the
   missionaries themselves, the mission was destined to undergo a sad
   declension in its affairs, and, after lingering for a while, was
   finally abandoned in despair. In addition to the barriers thrown in the
   way of the missionaries by the hostile chiefs and their partisans, were
   the troubles arising out of the treaty made by McIntosh and his party,
   by which the lands included in the chartered limits of Georgia were
   ceded to the United States, for the benefit of the state of Georgia,
   for the consideration of the sum of four hundred thousand dollars. This
   gave great offense to the majority of the nation, who affirmed that
   McIntosh and those who acted with him executed this treaty contrary to
   a law which had been promulgated in the public square, and they arose
   against him with violence, and massacred him and some others under
   circumstances of great barbarity. This threw the nation into great
   confusion, and exerted a most deleterious influence upon the interests
   of the mission.

   The school, however, was continued under all these discouragements, and
   by the judicious manner in which it was conducted, and the manifest
   improvement of the children, both in letters and religion, it acquired
   the confidence and respect of all who made it an object of inquiry. And
   the restraints against preaching the gospel being removed in 1826,
   owing, in a great measure, to the interference in behalf of the mission
   by the United States government, the mission presented a more
   flattering prospect, so that in 1829 there were reported seventy-one
   Church members at the Asbury station, namely, two whites, twenty-four
   Indians, and forty-five colored; and the school consisted of fifty
   scholars. Under this state of things the friends of the cause fondly
   anticipated a final triumph over infidelity and heathen superstition
   among this nation of Indians. But, alas! how often are all human
   expectations blasted!

   Such were the difficulties thrown in the way of this mission, that in
   1830 it was entirely abandoned. Their confirmed habits of intemperance,
   their predilection for savage life, the persevering opposition of most
   of the chiefs to the self-denying doctrines of the gospel, together
   with their proximity to dissipated whites, whose interest was promoted
   by furnishing the Indians with means of intoxication, combined, with
   the troubles arising out of the murder of McIntosh and others, to
   paralyze the efforts of the missionaries and their friends, and they
   were reluctantly compelled to abandon the enterprise in despair. The
   labor, however, was not lost; lasting impressions were made upon some
   minds; and some who were removed to the west have been gathered into
   the fold of Christ, and others, who have been since that time converted
   to the Christian faith, have traced their first impressions to the
   instructions of "father Hill" and his pious associates.

   Another aboriginal mission was commenced this year. This was among the
   Mohawks of Upper Canada. They had been partially civilized, and
   imperfectly instructed in the Christian religion; and yet their moral
   and religious state was very far from being improved.

   They were settled principally on an Indian reservation of land, sixty
   miles in length and twelve in breadth, on each side of the Grand river.
   At the head of this tribe was the celebrated Mohawk chief, Colonel
   Brant, whose name carried such terror into our frontier settlements
   during the revolutionary war. Soon after the termination of this severe
   struggle, chiefly through his solicitation, the Society for the
   Promotion of Christian Knowledge adopted measures to furnish these
   people with Christian instruction. A missionary was sent to preach to
   them, and the Gospel of St. Mark and the Prayer Book were translated
   into the Mohawk language, the former by Colonel Brant himself. But
   little permanent good, however, resulted from these efforts. Instead of
   producing any radical change in the heart and life of the people, they
   were merely initiated into an observance of the external rites and
   ceremonies of the church, while, like all other tribes who had mingled
   with the unconverted whites, they had become addicted to intemperance
   and its kindred vices.

   In this state they were when visited by a Methodist missionary this
   year. It is true, that from the time the Methodist itinerants first
   visited that country, they were in the habit of preaching occasionally
   to these people, but with little apparent effect. As early as the year
   1801 an Indian youth was baptized at a quarterly meeting held at the
   house of Mr. Jones, the father of Peter Jones, whose conversion and
   labors will be hereafter noticed; and it is remembered well that when
   Mr. Joseph Sawyer, the administrator of the ordinance, concluded the
   ceremony by prayer, he prayed most fervently that this youth might be
   the first-fruits of a harvest of souls from among these natives. The
   wife of Mr. Jones also, who was a Mohawk princess, was baptized about
   the same time, and received into the Church with her husband. These
   were all the aboriginal conversions known to the writer before the
   reformation of which we now speak commenced.

   The mission was begun under the patronage of the Genesee conference, to
   which Upper Canada was then attached, and Alvin Torry was appointed to
   its charge. The following extracts of letters received from brother
   Case will fully explain the manner in which this good work began and
   was carried forward: --

   "When I visited and preached to these Indians last June, I found
   several under awakenings; for they had heard occasionally a sermon from
   brothers Whitehead, Storey, and Matthews; and had for some time been in
   the habit of coming together at the house of T. D. to hear prayers in
   the Mohawk. Several manifested much concern, and appeared very desirous
   of the prayers and advice of the pious. These, with two youths who had
   lately received religious impressions at the Ancaster camp meeting, I
   formed into a society, giving charge of the society to brother S.
   Crawford. His account of the progress of the revival during my absence
   to conference I here insert, from his letter to me. We must beg some
   indulgence for being particular, considering that the subjects of this
   work are the first-fruits unto Christ, and that this revival may be
   seen in the native simplicity of these artless Indians. Brother C.'s
   account is as follows: --

   "During your absence to the conference I have continued to meet with
   our red brethren every week, giving them public discourses, as well as
   answering their anxious inquiries concerning the things of God. The
   Lord has indeed been gracious to this people, pouring out his Holy
   Spirit on our assemblies, and thereby giving the spirit of penitence,
   of prayer, and of praise. About the first who appeared deeply concerned
   for their souls were two women. One of them had, about fourteen years
   ago, known the way of the Lord, and had belonged to our society in the
   Allegheny. Having been a long time without the means of grace, she had
   lost her comforts and her zeal for God; but now, being again stirred up
   to return to the Lord, she became useful to others of her sex who were
   inquiring for the way of life. The other was a woman of moral
   deportment, and of respectable standing among her nation, but of great
   and painful afflictions: by a series of family trials she had been
   borne down with overwhelming sorrows. To this daughter of affliction
   the other woman gave religious counsel, urging that if she would give
   her heart to the Lord he would give comfort to her mind, as well as
   direct and support her in her worldly troubles. She listened to these
   things with much concern, and as she went to the spring for water she
   turned aside several times to pray. At length, under a sense of her
   unworthiness and sinfulness, she sunk to the earth, and was helpless
   for some time. When she recovered strength she came into her house, and
   calling her children around her, they all kneeled down to pray. While
   at prayer a weight of power came on them -- the daughter of fifteen
   cried aloud for mercy, and the mother again sunk to the floor. The
   daughter soon found peace, and praised the Lord. While the mother was
   yet mourning and praying, the youngest daughter, not yet four years of
   age, first kneeled by her mother, praying: then coming to her sister,
   she says, "Onetye ragh a gwogh nos ha ragh ge hea steage? Onetye ragh a
   gwogh nos ha ragh ge hea steage?" that is, "Why don't you send for the
   minister? why don't you send for the minister?" showing thereby a
   religious concern and intelligence remarkable for one of her age. The
   mother soon after obtained peace. She with her children are now a happy
   family, walking in the enjoyment of the Holy Comforter. Thus did the
   Lord bring these sincere inquirers to the knowledge of himself, while
   they were alone, calling on his name.

   "Another instance of extraordinary blessing among this people was on
   sabbath, the 27th of July last, when one of our brethren came to hold
   meeting with them. During singing and prayer there was such melting of
   heart and fervency throughout the assembly; -- some trembled and wept,
   others sunk to the floor, and there was a great cry for mercy through
   the congregation. Some cried in Messessaugah, "Chemenito! Kitta
   maugesse, chemuche nene," &c.; that is, "Great good Spirit! I am poor
   and evil," &c. Others in Mohawk prayed, "O Sayaner, souahhaah sadoeyn
   Roewaye Jesus Christ, Tandakweanderhek;" that is, "O Lord, the only
   begotten Son Jesus Christ, have mercy on us!" Others were encouraging
   the penitents to cast their burdens on the Lord. Others again were
   rejoicing over their converted neighbors. In this manner the meeting
   continued throughout the day. While these exercises were going on a
   little girl ran home to call her mother, who came directly over to the
   meeting. On entering the room where the people were praying she was
   smitten with conviction, and fell down crying for mercy. While in this
   distress her husband was troubled lest his wife should die, but was
   happily disappointed when, a few hours after, her sorrows were turned
   into joy, and she arose praising the Lord. From this time the husband
   set out to serve the Lord, and the next day he also found peace to his
   soul, as I will hereafter relate. During the day several found the
   Saviour's love, and retired with great peace and comfort; while others,
   with heavy hearts, wept and prayed as they returned comfortless to
   their habitations. The next day I visited them, when they welcomed me
   with much affection, declaring what peace and happiness they felt since
   their late conversion. A number soon came together, among whom was the
   Indian who, the day before, was so concerned for his wife. His
   convictions for sin appeared deep, and his mind was in much distress.
   We joined in prayer for him; when I had closed, an Indian woman prayed
   in Mohawk. While she was with great earnestness presenting to the Lord
   the case of this broken-hearted sinner, the Lord set his soul at
   liberty. Himself and family have since appeared much devoted to the
   service of the Lord. The next morning, assisted by an interpreter, I
   again preached to the Indians. After the meeting, observing a man
   leaning over the fence weeping, I invited him to a neighboring thicket,
   where I sung and prayed with him. I then called on him to pray; he
   began, but cried aloud for mercy with much contrition of spirit; but
   his tone was soon changed from prayer to praise. The work is spreading
   into a number of families. Sometimes the parents, sometimes the
   children, are first brought under concern. Without delay they fly to
   God by prayer, and generally they do not long mourn before their souls
   are set at liberty. The change which has taken place among this people
   appears very great, and, I doubt not, will do honor to the cause of
   religion, and thereby glorify God, who has promised to give the
   Gentiles for the inheritance of his Son.'

   "On my return from conference I called and preached to the Mohawks, and
   have it on my plan to continue to attend to them in my regular route.
   After having explained the rules of society to them, twenty were
   admitted as members of society. It was a season of refreshing to us
   all. On the 28th of September I again preached to them. The crowd was
   now such that they could not all get into the house. Their usual
   attention and fervor were apparent, and near the conclusion of the
   discourse the hearts of many were affected, and they praised the Lord
   for his power and goodness. In meeting them in class they appeared to
   be progressing finely, advancing in the knowledge and love of God.
   Several who had been under awakening, having now returned from their
   hunting, requested to be received, and were admitted into the society.
   The society now consists of twenty-nine members, three of whom are
   white persons. We have also a sabbath school of Indian children,
   consisting of about twenty, who are learning to read. Some young men
   have kindly offered their services to instruct them. This good work is
   about fifty miles from the mouth of the Grand river, about six miles
   from the Mohawk village, and four miles north of the great road leading
   from Ancaster to Longpoint. About twelve miles from the mouth of the
   Grand river another gracious work is commenced, among both Indians and
   whites. [10] About twelve have found peace to their souls, among whom
   are four of the Delaware tribe. This awakening first took place in the
   mind of a white man -- a notorious sinner. It was in time of preaching
   that the power of God arrested him. He wept and trembled like
   Belteshazzar. After meeting he came to me, saying, I don't know what is
   the matter with me. I never felt so before: I believe I am a great
   sinner, but I wish to do better: what shall I do to be saved?' I told
   him the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, to convince him of sin, and he
   must repent and turn to God. There is evidently a great change in this
   man, who we hope may be an honor to the cause of religion in this
   wicked part of the reservation. The awakening is prevailing in several
   families. We have twelve in society here. In the townships of Rainham
   and Walpole there are still good appearances. Indeed, at most of my
   appointments we have the presence and blessing of the Lord; so that our
   missionary friends will have no occasion to repent the prayers they
   have offered, the money they have expended, and the tears they have
   shed in behalf of the once miserable and forsaken sinners, but now
   happy and blessed converts, on the Grand river. Much labor is now
   necessary, and I would gladly have assistance; but my health is good,
   and I would not increase expenses. In weariness my mind is comforted,
   and my soul is delighted in feeding these hungry natives with the
   provisions of the gospel. O, I could endure hunger, or sit down
   thankfully to their humble fare, or lie down in Indian wigwams all my
   life, to be employed in such a work as this, and especially if favored
   with such consolations as at times I have enjoyed since I commenced my
   labors in this mission. I hope for ever to be grateful for His mercy in
   thus blessing his word for the conversion of these poor perishing
   sinners. Dear sir, a letter of instruction and counsel would be
   thankfully received. I hope I have an interest in the prayers of my
   brethren. Farewell. Very affectionately yours in the gospel of Christ."

   "Letter from the Rev. William Case, dated Niagara, U. C.,

   October 7, 1823

   "In my letter of the 27th of August I mentioned that an awakening had
   taken place among the Indians on the Grand river, and promised a more
   particular account of this work after my next visit among them. But as
   brother Torry has sent you a pretty full account, a few remarks will
   suffice. On the 24th of September, in company with a religious friend,
   we passed into the woods, and arrived at the Indian dwellings about
   nine o'clock in the morning, a time at which they generally hold their
   morning devotions. We were received with cordial kindness, and the
   shell was blown as a call to assemble for religious service. Soon the
   people, parents and children, were seen in all directions repairing to
   the house of prayer. When they arrived they took their seats with great
   solemnity, observing a profound silence till the service commenced.
   Having understood that they were in the habit of singing in the Mohawk,
   I requested them to sing in their usual manner, which they did
   melodiously. The following verse is taken from the hymn, and the
   translation into English is annexed: --

   O sa ya' ner Tak gwogh sni ye nough Ne na yonk high sweagh se, Ne o ni
   a yak hi sea ny, Sa ya' ner tea hegh sm yeh.'

   Enlighten our dark souls, till they Thy sacred love embrace: Assist our
   minds (by nature frail) With thy celestial grace.'

   "After the sermon several addressed the assembly in the Mohawk, and the
   meeting was concluded by prayer from one of the Indians in his native
   tongue. The use of ardent spirits appears to be entirely laid aside,
   while the duties of religion are punctually and daily observed. The
   hour of prayer is sounded by the blowing of the shell, when they attend
   for their morning meetings with the regularity of their morning meals.
   The Indians here are very desirous of obtaining education for their
   children, and they are making such efforts as their low circumstances
   will allow: for this purpose a schoolhouse is commenced: a sabbath
   school is now in operation, where about twenty children are taught the
   rudiments of reading, and we are not without hope of seeing a day
   school established for the ensuing winter. Certainly this mission has
   been attended with the divine blessing beyond every expectation. It was
   not at first commenced with the professed design of converting the
   natives, (though they were had in view,) but for the benefit of the
   white inhabitants scattered over the Indian lands. The merciful Lord,
   however, has been pleased to endow the mission with abundant grace, and
   the friends of missions may now renew their songs of gratitude and joy
   over thirty more converted natives of the forest, together with an
   equal number of converts among the white population."

   The Cherokee mission was also commenced this year. The Cherokee Indians
   inhabited a tract of country included in the states of Georgia and
   North Carolina on the east, Alabama on the west, and that part of
   Tennessee lying south of Hiwassee and Tennessee rivers, comprising not
   less than ten millions of acres. These natives had been partially
   civilized; some of them had become wealthy, possessing domestic cattle
   in abundance, and were thriving agriculturists. White people had
   settled among them, intermarriages had taken place, so that there were
   many half-breeds of respectable standing and character, who could speak
   both the English and Cherokee languages, and many of the children were
   well educated. And had they been left undisturbed in their possessions,
   they doubtless would have risen into a wealthy, intelligent, religious,
   and respectable community.

   The American Board of Missions commenced a mission among these people
   as early as 1817, which has been much assisted in its funds by the
   government of the United States, and has, no doubt, exerted a salutary
   influence on the Indian character.

   It was in the spring of this year, at the request of a native Cherokee,
   by the name of Richard Riley, that the Rev. Richard Neeley, of the
   Tennessee conference, visited the nation, and preached in the house of
   Mr. Riley. In the course of the summer, being assisted by the Rev.
   Robert Boyd, Mr. Neeley formed a society of thirty-three members, and
   Richard Riley was appointed a class-leader. At a quarterly meeting
   which was held there a short time after, by the Rev. William McMahon,
   presiding elder of Huntsville district, the power of God was displayed
   in a most signal manner, during which several of the natives found
   peace with God through faith in the Lord Jesus, and became members of
   the Church. In December following the Rev. Andrew J. Crawford, who had
   been appointed to the charge of this mission, arrived there, and met a
   council composed of the principal men of the nation, who approved of
   the mission, and, with their consent, a school was commenced on the
   30th of that month. This was the beginning of the good work which
   terminated in the conversion of many of the Cherokees to the faith of
   Christianity. In reporting the state of this mission to the Tennessee
   conference, in 1822, the committee use the following language: --

   "Your committee look upon these openings of Divine Providence as
   special and loud calls to our conference, our superintendents, our
   ministers, and members in general, to unite their zeal and exertions,
   to afford this destitute people the means of salvation. O, brethren!
   come up to the help of the Lord against the mighty. What has God
   already wrought, and how plain and simple the means by which he has
   performed the mighty work! Only consider, but two years ago a Methodist
   preacher had never preached in this part of the Cherokee nation. Our
   worthy and pious friend, Mr. Riley, as has been stated, invited
   brothers Neeley and Boyd to cross the Tennessee river and preach at his
   house, and these zealous and pious young men, who had just been called,
   like Elisha, from the plow to the pulpit, embraced the invitation, and
   flew upon the wings of love to plant the gospel among the Indians,
   believing that a Methodist preacher is never out of his way when he is
   searching for the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and bringing
   sinners home to God. Robert Boyd is no more! he is gone to his reward;
   but he lives in the hearts of these pious Indians, and never, no,
   never, while their memory is left them, will they cease to remember
   Robert Boyd.

   "We now have one hundred and eight regular members of society in this
   part of the nation, and a number of the children can read the word of
   God, and some of them can write a tolerably good hand; and the whole
   amount of moneys expended does not exceed two hundred dollars. Indeed,
   your committee are of opinion, that a great parade about missionary
   establishments, and the expenditure of many thousands of dollars to
   give the heathen science and occupation, without religion, is of but
   little advantage to them. For, after all their acquirements, they are
   still savages, unless their hearts be changed by the grace of God and
   the power of the gospel; but this blessed gospel, which is the power of
   God to the salvation of all that believe, whenever and wherever its
   divine influences are implanted in the heart by the efficient
   operations of the Holy Ghost, makes man a new creature, and fits him
   for his place in society."

   The success which attended these efforts among the aborigines of our
   country acted as a divine charm upon the members of the Church
   generally, and contributed not a little to diffuse the spirit of
   revival, and to excite a generous liberality throughout our entire
   borders. It tended also to silence the objections of those who had
   doubted the expediency of forming the society, or of the feasibility of
   reclaiming the wandering savages of our wildernesses from their
   heathenish superstitions and vicious habits.

   Besides these Indian missions, others were undertaken for the benefit
   of the destitute parts of the white settlements. Last year the Rev.
   Fitch Reed, of the Genesee conference, was appointed to York, (now
   Toronto,) in Upper Canada, with Rev. Kenneth M. K. Smith as his helper.
   Their mission extended into the settlements in the neighborhood of
   Toronto, which, at that time, were new, poor, and destitute of the
   gospel. Some idea may be formed of the difficulties with which they had
   to contend in traveling through particular parts of the country, from
   the fact that brother Smith, who devoted himself chiefly to the back
   settlements, was in the habit of carrying an ax with him, so that when
   he came to a stream of water that he could not ford, (which was
   frequently the case,) he felled a tree across it, on which he passed
   over. In some instances, it is stated, where the trees stood opposite
   to each other on the banks of the creek, and formed a junction at the
   top, he would climb one tree and descend another, and thus pass on to
   his appointments among this scattered population. Their labors were
   blessed, and a foundation was laid for the establishment of societies
   which have subsequently much prospered.

   When they first went among the people they found them engrossed in the
   cares of the world, desecrating the sabbath for purposes of amusement,
   idle recreation, or secular labor; and some who had once professed
   religion had cast off the fear of God, and were immersed in the
   pleasures of sin. It was not long, however, before the word took such
   effect that the houses were crowded with attentive hearers. The sabbath
   especially, instead of being devoted to profane revelry, was spent in
   religious devotion, and many were inquiring what they should do to be
   saved. The result was, that this year, 1822, there were returned on the
   Minutes in this mission one hundred and four; thirty-four in York, and
   seventy in the new settlements.

   To aid the missionaries in their work, the American Bible Society made
   a generous donation of Bibles and testaments for gratuitous
   distribution among the poor in that district of country.

   Many parts of our general work were blessed with revivals of the work
   of God. Among others, the following may be mentioned: -- Brooklyn, Long
   Island, was powerfully visited with the refreshing influences of the
   Spirit, under the labors of the Rev. Lewis Pease. This work commenced
   at a camp meeting held at Musquito Cove, Long Island, and was
   productive of the conversion and addition to the Church in that place
   of not less than one hundred souls. Several towns on the Amenia circuit
   were visited by powerful revivals, which terminated in the conversion
   of about two hundred souls, one hundred and seventy of whom joined our
   Church, and the rest were divided between the Presbyterians and
   Baptists. Among these converts, several, at a place called Oblong, had
   been Universalists. Being convinced of the excellence of the power of
   religion, they cast away their dependence upon a mere speculative
   belief in Christianity, and yielded to be saved now, by "grace, through
   faith."

   A work of God also prevailed on the Tolland circuit, New England
   conference, which eventuated in the conversion of about two hundred and
   fifty, of almost all ages, and of both sexes. At a camp meeting held at
   East Hartford, which was numerously attended, there were manifest
   displays of the power and grace of God in the awakening and conversion
   of souls. The fruits of this revival were divided among the Methodists,
   Congregationalists, and Baptists, about one hundred being added to the
   Methodist Church. [11]

   The Upper Canada district, then under the charge of the Rev. William
   Case, is thus described by him: --

   "Blessed be the Lord, we are prospering finely in this country. Our
   congregations, sabbath schools, missionary collections, a
   church-building spirit, as well as conversions, and order and harmony
   in the societies, all demonstrate the rising strength of Zion in these
   parts. There are now finishing or commencing twenty churches in this
   upper half of the province. We have more than forty sabbath schools,
   and one thousand scholars. These nurseries of virtue and religious
   information promise much to the prosperity of the rising generation,
   both in a civil and religious point of view. A great and happy
   improvement is visible since the close of the late war, which, in many
   places, by the confusion and calamities it introduced, had broken down
   the barriers of vice. Churches are crowded with listening hearers.
   Youth and children, instead of wandering in the fields, or loitering in
   the streets, are in many places thronging to the schools, with their
   books in their hands, and learning to read the book of God. One man,
   who has a large family of children, a few days since observed to me
   that, 'since sabbath schools began, he had had no trouble in the
   government of his family.'"

   On the Smyrna circuit, Delaware, there was an outpouring of the Spirit,
   which resulted in the conversion of many souls; one hundred and twenty
   were connected with our Church, forty of whom were colored people.
   Heretofore this revival the colored members of the Church had been much
   divided in spirit, by the efforts of the Allenites to form a party; but
   this good work had the happy effect of uniting them more closely
   together, and of cementing their union with the Church which had nursed
   them from their infancy.

   In Surry county, in Virginia, through the agency of camp meetings and
   other means of grace, about three hundred souls were brought to the
   knowledge of God by faith in Jesus Christ, and the general impression
   made on the public mind was most favorable to the cause of truth and
   love. In Lynchburg also, in this state, there were added to the Church
   upward of one hundred members, as the result of a revival in that
   place.

   At a camp meeting held in the Scioto district, Ohio, the work of God
   prevailed powerfully, and from thence spread in different directions
   through the country. This meeting, which was under the superintendence
   of the Rev. G. R. Jones, was attended by about sixty of the converted
   Indians of the Wyandots, among whom were several of the chiefs who had
   embraced Christianity. These spoke in a most feeling manner of the work
   of God in their own hearts, and among the people of their nation, while
   tears of grateful joy bespoke the interest which the congregation felt
   in their spiritual and eternal welfare.

   On the Northumberland district, under the charge of the Rev. H. Smith,
   by means of various camp meetings which were held in the several
   circuits, not less than two hundred souls were brought to God, while a
   conviction of the necessity of being reconciled to him through faith in
   his Son spread extensively among the people in that region of country.

   The Hudson river district, New York conference, through a similar
   agency, shared largely in the good work this year.

   The New Rochelle circuit, New York, was blessed with a great revival of
   religion, under the labors of the Rev. Elijah Woolsey and his
   colleagues. White Plains, Rye, Sawpit, and New Rochelle all shared in
   the benefits of this glorious work: and so earnest were many to attend
   the meetings, with a view to seek the salvation of their souls, that
   some came from ten to twelve miles, and many such returned rejoicing in
   God their Saviour. In consequence of this work, the net increase in
   this circuit among the whites was one hundred and nine. [12]

   In Washington city, D. C., God poured out his Spirit in a remarkable
   manner, in answer to the prayers of his people. During this work, in
   little more than two months, one hundred and fifty-eight were received
   into the Church as probationers.

   There was also a good work in the city of New York, about three hundred
   being added to the Church. This was encouraging to those who had
   mourned over the departure of so many two years before.

   I have before remarked, that during this period of our history we were
   called upon to sustain a new warfare to defend ourselves against the
   assaults of our opponents. Whether it was from jealousy of our rising
   prosperity, or from a real belief that our doctrines were dangerous to
   the souls of men, other denominations, more particularly the
   Calvinists, seemed to rally to the charge against our ministry, the
   economy of our Church, and our modes of carrying on the work of God.
   Hence a spirit of controversy was infused into the sermons which were
   delivered by our preachers, much more than formerly, the necessity for
   which was urged from witnessing new modes of attack. Indeed, a new
   system of divinity was rising into notice, differing in some respects
   from the Calvinism of former days, in which a universal atonement was
   recognized in connection with the doctrine of eternal and universal
   decrees, the force of which, however, it was attempted to avoid by
   inculcating the doctrine of a "natural ability and a moral inability."
   By the use of this subtle distinction, and the doctrine of universal
   atonement, keeping out of view the old doctrine of universal decrees,
   some were induced to believe that the difference between this new
   divinity and Methodism was but slight, and therefore they might, so far
   as these doctrines were concerned, embrace one as well as the other.
   Our preachers felt it to be their duty to unravel the sophistry of
   these arguments, by showing that, so long as that doctrine of universal
   decrees, which involved the notion of unconditional election and
   reprobation, was held fast, the two Systems were at variance, and could
   never be made to harmonize.

   We were also frequently denounced as Arminians. And Arminians were
   represented as denying the doctrine of human depravity, of regeneration
   by the efficient grace of God, and the necessity of divine aid in
   working out and securing our eternal salvation. As this was a most
   unjust imputation, we felt called upon to make a full and fair
   statement of our doctrinal views, and to defend ourselves against such
   manifest perversions of our real, published, and acknowledged
   sentiments. In doing this, though there may have been occasional
   exhibitions of heat on both sides, and a controversial spirit indulged,
   in some instances, to too great an extent, yet truth was elicited, and
   our doctrines and usages became better understood, and more highly and
   generally appreciated by the community.

   With a view to secure a more commodious and permanent location for the
   Wesleyan seminary in the city of New York, a site was this year
   procured in Crosby Street, by leasing three lots of ground, on which
   the trustees erected a brick building, sixty-five feet in length and
   forty in breadth, the upper part of which was occupied as a place of
   worship. Here a male and female academy was kept until the premises
   were purchased by the agents of the Book Concern, in the year 1824,
   when another building was procured in Mott Street. The academy at the
   White Plains grew out of the one first commenced in the city of New
   York; and when the property of the latter was disposed of; after
   discharging the debts of the institution, the balance was given to the
   White Plains academy, which has continued to the present time.

   Though the Wesleyan seminary did not fully answer the benevolent
   designs of its original founders, it is believed that its establishment
   gave an impulse to the cause of education which has gone on increasing
   in power and influence to the present day.

   Thirty-seven preachers were this year located, twenty-four returned
   supernumerary, and seventy-one superannuated, and four had died,
   namely, Hamilton Jefferson, Edward Orem, William Early, and John Pitts,
   each of whom died in the full assurance of faith.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This Year: 252,645; Last Year: 239,087;
   Increase: 13,558 -- Colored This Year: 44,377; Last Year: 42,059;
   Increase: 2,318 -- Total This Year: 297,022; Last Year: 281,146 --
   Increase: 15,876 [13] -- Preachers This Year: 1,106; Last Year: 977;
   Increase: 129.

   It will be perceived that there was a more than usual increase to the
   number of traveling preachers, owing to a diminution in the number of
   locations, and a proportionate increase to the list of superannuated
   preachers. This was probably owing to the better provision which began
   to be made, in consequence of the regulations of the General Conference
   of 1816, for the support of the families of preachers, and the
   furnishing parsonages for their accommodation. This last remedy,
   however, was but partially provided as yet, though the work was happily
   begun, and has been gradually going forward to the present time.

  1823

   The work of God this year was steadily advancing within the bounds of
   the several annual conferences. Some of the circuits in the older parts
   of the work, in consequence of the increase of members and societies,
   were much contracted, and the number of stations was necessarily
   multiplied. In this manner the work was becoming more and more compact,
   pastoral labor more easily and punctually performed, and the local
   interests of each society more minutely attended to. Still, new
   circuits were formed in the frontier settlements, new missions opened,
   and some villages and neighborhoods not before occupied by our
   ministry, through the aid of the Missionary Society, were supplied with
   the word and ordinances of God. These I shall endeavor to notice, so
   far as authentic documents and other sources of information will enable
   me to do it correctly.

   The Missionary Society, having been recognized by the General
   Conference, was now considered as an integral part of the general plan
   of carrying on the work of God, and was becoming more and more
   identified with the other institutions of the Church. Its blessed
   results, also, which were seen and felt, more especially among the
   wandering savages of our country, entwined it around the affections of
   our people, and called forth their liberality for its support.

   The cause of missions was also much aided about this time by the
   eloquent appeals of the Rev. John Summerfield, a young minister who
   came over from Ireland and joined the New York conference in 1821. He
   had attracted much attention since his arrival among us by the sweet
   and melting strains of his pulpit oratory, and as he entered into the
   spirit of our Missionary Society with great zeal and energy, he
   contributed much to the diffusion of its benevolent principles among
   the people at large. While stationed in the city of New York, in 1822,
   where he drew vast multitudes to listen to the accents of redeeming
   love, which fell from his lips in the purest strains of gospel
   eloquence, he adopted the practice of delivering lectures to the
   children at stated times, at which he made collections to aid the
   Missionary Society. And the hearty and efficient manner in which he
   espoused this noble enterprise of the Young Men's Missionary Society of
   New York to elect him as their president. His zeal in the cause of God,
   and the popularity of his talents for addressing public assemblies on
   anniversary occasions, induced so many applications from the benevolent
   and charitable societies for his services, to which he yielded with
   perhaps too great a readiness for his strength, that he found himself
   wearing out by the intensity of his labors. This induced him, by the
   advice of his physicians and friends, to make a voyage to France for
   the benefit of his health. While there he sent the following address to
   the society of which he was the president, and which, as a sample of
   the writer's manner of communicating his thoughts, and an evidence of
   the ardor with which he entered into, this subject, I think worthy of
   preservation. It is as follows: --

   "Marseilles, February 20, 1823

   "My Dear Brethren: -- You are too well acquainted with the
   circumstances which prevent my filling the chair upon this pleasurable
   occasion, to require that I should dwell upon them; indeed, it would be
   irrelevant to those important objects which have assembled you
   together: not private sympathies, but the public good, will be your
   present theme; and in this I realize my full share of joy with you, for
   although in a far distant land, and that a land of strangers, my
   affections point to those whom I love in the truth,' and with whom I
   glory to be in any wise associated in carrying on the cause of our
   common Lord.

   "Upon the occasion of an anniversary like yours, exhortation to renewed
   zeal might be deemed impertinent; the pulse of every heart beats too
   high on such an occasion to anticipate any decay in your future
   exertions. This is rather a of congratulation and rejoicing; and in
   commencing another year of labor and reward, I devoutly implore for you
   a continuance of that grace which has enabled you to remain 'steadfast,
   immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.'

   "In common with all who love the interests of the Redeemer's kingdom, I
   rejoice at witnessing that increase of missionary zeal and missionary
   means which the past year lays open, not only in your auxiliary and its
   parent society, but among other denominations of the Christian church;
   in this you also joy and rejoice with me,' for whether Paul, Apollos,
   or Cephas, all are ours;' -- so that in whatever part of the vineyard
   the work is wrought, we view it not as the work of man, but as it is in
   truth, the work of God;' for neither is he that planteth any thing,
   neither he that watereth: it is God that giveth the increase.' We may
   collect from different funds, but we bring to the same exchequer; and
   have no greater joy than in the accumulation of the revenue of that
   relative glory of the divine character which redounds from the
   salvation of men, through Christ Jesus, unto the glory and praise of
   God the Father.'

   "But, abstracted from general views of the mighty work of missions, I
   regard the branch to which you are attached with peculiar pleasure on
   this occasion. You know that, from the beginning of our existence in
   the religious world, Methodism has always been a history of missions;'
   its venerable founder, considering that this was the first character of
   the Christian church, and believing it would be the last, even at that
   day when many shall run to and fro, and knowledge be increased,' wisely
   instituted a ministry which should be a standing monument of what God
   could do by this means. And what has God wrought? Some there are, whom
   the frost of many winters has not chilled to death, to whom our
   father's words may still be spoken,

   Saw ye not the cloud arise? Little as a human hand'

   "Its present state we ourselves have lived to see:

   Now it spreads along the skies -- Hangs o'er all the thirsty land! When
   he first the work begun, Small and feeble was his day; Now the word
   doth swiftly run, Now it wins its widening way! More and more it
   spreads and grows; Ever mighty to prevail, Sin's strong holds it now
   o'erthrows, Shakes the trembling gates of hell!'

   "Indeed, there are seasons wherein the overwhelming influence of these
   reflections so rests upon the mind, that unless we heard the warning
   voice, What doest thou here, Elijah?' we should stand at the base of
   this mighty structure, and wholly spend our time for naught, in
   admiring the symmetry and proportion of all its parts, beholding what
   manner of stones and buildings are here!' But, thus warned, we too
   arise and build.' Thus instead of the fathers are the children, and the
   children's children shall yet add thereto, till the topstone be raised,
   shouting, Grace, grace unto it!'

   "My dear brethren, if there is a scene within the universe of God
   calculated to lift our minds to heaven; if there is a scene calculated
   to bring down the heavenly host to earth, it is that which portrays in
   anticipation the final triumph of the gospel of the grace of God.' Yes,
   the gospel must ultimately and universally triumph! Well may we
   exclaim, What an object is this! It is the fairest scene that the
   pencil of heaven, dipped in the colors of its own rainbow, can
   delineate; and even the great voice issuing from the eternal throne can
   utter nothing more exhilarating and sublime than the consummation of
   this event, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men!' Yes, my
   brethren,

   Jesus shall reign where'er the sun Does his successive courses run.'

   "The glow which pervaded the apostle's mighty mind did not cause his
   pen to aberrate; the spirit of inspiration sat upon him when he
   declared that Jesus must reign till he hath put all enemies under his
   feet.' That day will come! Do we expect to swell the number who shall
   grace his triumph? Do we burn with seraphic ardor to be among his train
   when he shall be revealed from heaven with power and great glory?' Then
   gird up the loins of your mind; be sober, and hope to the end, for the
   grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus
   Christ!' Wherefore comfort one another with these words,' for truly it
   is with the same comfort wherewith I myself am comforted of God.'

   "You, my dear brethren of this auxiliary, who are the managers of its
   concerns, I hail. I am also one of you. I write unto you, young men,
   because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you.' Early
   separated from the world, and ardently employed in seeking the
   interests of a better country, that is, a heavenly, God is not ashamed
   to be called your God, for he has prepared for you a city.' Walk
   therefore by the same rule, mind the same thing.' Love not the world,
   neither the things that are in the world.' Set your affections on
   things above, and not on things upon the earth.' Soon you shall hear it
   sounded, Because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
   thee' ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!'

   "The friends and subscribers of this auxiliary are entitled to your
   thanks; they have merited them will; by means of the numerous little
   streams which have been directed to our reservoir by the friends of
   missions, our water-pots,' if not always full, have never become dry.
   On this occasion, however, you look to have them filled even to the
   brim;' and may He who can convert our base material to subserve his
   glorious purpose of saving men, draw forth' therefrom that wine of the
   kingdom which cheers the heart of God and man.'

   "I remain, my dear brethren, your fellow-laborer and servant,

   J. SUMMERFIELD."

   A mission was commenced this year among the Pottawatamy Indians, a
   small tribe settled in the neighborhood of Fort Clark, on the Fox
   river, in the state of Illinois, and the Rev. Jesse Walker was
   appointed to prosecute its objects.

   But though he succeeded, after much toil and expense, in establishing a
   school and conciliating the friendship of some of the adult Indians,
   yet the missionary was compelled, after seven years of hard labor, to
   abandon the enterprise as hopeless. Their strong attachments to savage
   life, and incurable suspicions of white men, together with their final
   determination to remove west, frustrated the benevolent attempts to
   introduce the gospel and the arts of civilized life among them.

   A fragment of the Wyandot tribe of Indians was settled in Upper Canada,
   on the banks of the river Carnard. These were first visited by Mr.
   Finley, and were afterward transferred to the care of Mr. Case, to whom
   the superintendence of all the aboriginal missions in that province was
   committed. About twenty of these Indians embraced the Christian faith,
   and became members of our Church.

   In the bounds of the Tennessee conference there was a missionary
   district formed, embracing that part of Jackson's Purchase that lies in
   the states of Tennessee and Kentucky, which was committed to the charge
   of the Rev. Lewis Garrett. This was a new country, rapidly filling up
   with inhabitants, and there were no less than nine preachers appointed
   to supply them with the means of salvation. As before remarked, Mr.
   Garrett was first appointed a missionary to this region of country,
   which contained not less than ten thousand square miles, in 1820, and
   he succeeded in forming a four weeks' circuit, in which he was
   assisted, by the appointment of the presiding elder, by Andrew J.
   Crawford. And so successful had they been in 1821, that in 1822 there
   were returned on the Minutes of the conference one hundred and
   fifty-five members, thirteen of whom were colored people. The
   inhabitants generally received the messengers of the gospel with joyful
   hearts, opening their doors and making them welcome, and also
   contributing, according to their scanty means, for their support, for
   as yet the Missionary Society was able to appropriate but little for
   the furtherance of domestic missions.

   These men of God, though they had to contend with poverty, bad roads,
   and to preach in log huts, or under the foliage of the native trees,
   penetrated into every part of the country where settlements had been
   formed, and succeeded in establishing several circuits, in which they
   returned for the Minutes of 1823 one thousand one hundred and
   twenty-six members, one hundred and one of whom were colored, chiefly
   slaves.

   This year the gospel was more extensively introduced into the territory
   of Michigan, which was erected into an independent state and received
   into the Union in the year 1836.

   This country was originally settled by the French, who sent Catholic
   missionaries there as early as 1648, and the city of Detroit was
   founded in 1670, by a few French families. Its growth was slow, but the
   people gradually enlarged their borders on each side of the Detroit
   river, a strait about twenty-four miles in length, which connects Lakes
   St. Clair and Erie. In 1763 this country, together with Upper Canada,
   passed, by the right of conquest, from the French into the hands of the
   British, and so remained until the war of the revolution separated it
   from the British empire and connected it with the United States. After
   this, emigrants from different parts of the Union began to mingle with
   the original settlers.

   When this country was first visited by a Methodist missionary, in 1804,
   it was in a deplorable state as to religion and morals. [14] In Detroit
   there was no preaching except by the French Catholics, and their
   influence in favor of the pure morality of the gospel was extremely
   feeble. The few Protestant emigrants who had settled in Detroit and
   some of the adjoining places were entirely destitute of a ministry of
   their own order, and were fast assimilating into the customs and habits
   of those with whom they associated. And though repeated efforts had
   been made, from time to time, to establish Methodism in Detroit, they
   must have been attended with but little success, for we find no members
   returned on the Minutes of conference for that place until the year
   1822, and then the number was only twenty.

   This year, 1823, the Rev. Alfred Brunson was stationed on the Detroit
   circuit, which stretched through the country for four hundred miles.
   This he and his colleague, the Rev. Samuel Baker, surrounded each once
   in four weeks, giving the people a sermon every two weeks; and their
   labors were so far blessed, that in 1824 the number of Church members
   had increased to one hundred and sixty-one.

   This year a small society was formed at St. Mary's. This was a military
   post belonging to the United States, situated on the strait by that
   name, about eighty miles in length, and which connects Lakes Superior
   and Huron, and is about four hundred miles in a northerly direction
   from Detroit. The most of this distance, at that time, was a
   wilderness, infested with beasts of prey, and dotted with here and
   there an Indian village. It was at this place that a few pious
   soldiers, who had been converted at Sackett's Harbor, were removed,
   and, being almost destitute of every religions privilege, formed
   themselves into a class, chose a leader, and met together for mutual
   edification and comfort, holding their meetings in the woods until the
   barracks were erected, when they were allowed the use of the hospital.
   They were much assisted by the good countenance of Lieutenant Becker, a
   pious member of the Presbyterian Church, to whom they were attracted by
   a congeniality of feeling, and they were mutually refreshed and
   strengthened in their social meetings. In the course of the winter
   their number increased to about fourteen, which much encouraged them to
   persevere in their work of faith and labor of love.

   This state of things in that part of the country induced Mr. Brunson to
   call loudly for help, and this led to the establishment of St. Mary's
   mission a short time after.

   The territory of Florida had recently been ceded to the United States,
   as an indemnity for the spoliations committed upon our commerce by
   Spanish cruisers; and as it is the policy of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church to enter every open door for the spread of the gospel, a
   missionary, the Rev. Joshua N. Glenn, was sent this year to St.
   Augustine, the oldest town in North America, and capital of East
   Florida. Most of the inhabitants of this place and the surrounding
   country are of Spanish descent, and members of the Roman Catholic
   Church. There were, however, a few Anglo-Americans settled among the
   Creoles, to whom our missionary addressed himself in the name of the
   Lord, and he succeeded in raising a society of fifty-two members, forty
   of whom were people of color. This, however, has been a barren place
   for the growth of Methodism; for even now, 1840,) after continued
   efforts of seventeen years, St. Augustine is scarcely represented among
   our stations. This, however, is owing to other causes than the want of
   a disposition on the part of the people to receive the gospel. The late
   Indian warfare has exerted a most destructive influence upon the
   religious state of the population through all that region of country,
   and more particularly upon the citizens of St. Augustine, the chief
   rendezvous of hostile armies.

   Chatahoochee, in the bounds of the Florida territory, was also selected
   as missionary ground, and its cultivation was committed to Messrs. John
   J. Triggs and John Slade. They entered upon their work with zeal and
   perseverance; and notwithstanding the newness of the country, and the
   scattered state of the population, there were returned on the Minutes
   for 1824, as the fruit of their labor, three hundred and fifty-six
   members, sixty-four of whom were colored people.

   The Rev. Alexander Talley was appointed a missionary this year to
   Pensacola, Mobile, and Blakely. Though no immediate fruit of his labor
   in these places was seen, yet he opened the way for the introduction of
   the gospel into that region of country, which has since flourished
   under the labors of those who succeeded him in his work.

   St. Mary's, situated near the mouth of St. Mary's river, in the state
   of Georgia, near the frontier of Florida, was visited this year with a
   revival of the work of God, under the ministry of the Rev. Elijah
   Sinclair. Though there had been in this place once a flourishing
   society, it had become scattered abroad, so that when Mr. Sinclair
   arrived there, in 1822, he could scarcely find a "place for the sole of
   his foot;" but he soon obtained favor in the eyes of the people, and
   God so blessed his faithful labors, that in 1823 there were returned
   forty-one members of the Church; and the good work has gradually
   increased from that time to this.

   Cumberland mission, in Kentucky, was commenced this year by the Rev.
   William Chambers. He so far succeeded in his efforts as to return two
   hundred and sixty-one members, two hundred and fifty-one whites and ten
   colored, in 1824.

   In 1821 Methodism was introduced into the town of St. Louis, by the
   Rev. Jesse Walker, who went there as a missionary under the direction
   of the Missouri conference. St. Louis is the largest town on the west
   bank of the Mississippi river, and second to New Orleans in importance
   as a place for commercial pursuits. Its original settlers were French
   Roman Catholics, this being another in the range of settlements which
   they established along the course of the waters from Quebec to New
   Orleans. It had been, for some time before this, rising in importance,
   and increasing in its population by emigrations from different parts of
   the United States and from the old world, and was considered the center
   of commerce in that part of the country. In this mixed population the
   missionary had some prejudices to encounter, and the more so on account
   of the indiscreet conduct of some who had represented the citizens of
   that place to the eastern churches as being but little removed from
   barbarians. Mr. Walker, however, was kindly received by a few, and he
   gradually gained the confidence of the community, raised a society of
   about one hundred members, and succeeded in building a house of worship
   thirty-five feet in length and twenty-five in width. The Rev. Alexander
   McAlister, in giving an account of this work, adverts to the Missionary
   Society in the following words: --

   "It is yet in its infancy, but its growing importance portends greater
   good to mankind than any institution of the kind hitherto known. I am
   induced to believe that there will be both numerous and liberal
   contributions to support the institution, since the money so raised is
   to be deposited in the hands of men who will, no doubt, distribute it
   with an economical hand for the support of those missionaries whose
   zeal is not a transient blaze, but a constant flame, consuming vice and
   iniquity before it, and with a gentle hand leading the penitent sons
   and daughters of men up to the throne of grace, where they may obtain
   the mercy and salvation of God."

   Mr. Walker was reappointed to St. Louis in 1822, at the end of which
   year there were returned, including the station and circuit, one
   hundred and sixty-six white and forty colored members of the Church. He
   was succeeded this year by the Rev. William Beauchamp, whose labors
   were acceptable and useful, and the cause has gradually gone forward
   from that time to this.

   The aboriginal missions, which had been begun under such favorable
   auspices, and which promised so much good to the wandering tribes of
   our wildernesses, continued to prosper this year more than ever. These,
   together with the exertions which were made in their behalf, tended
   powerfully to awaken a deep and lively interest through the ranks of
   our Israel in favor of prosecuting the cause with increasing zeal and
   energy. The Wyandot mission, which had been committed to the care of
   Mr. Finley, was this year visited by Bishop McKendree, who entered most
   heartily into the cause of missions, contributing to its support, and
   giving, by his example, an impetus to the work in every direction. And
   as his testimony is that of an eye-witness, capable of estimating the
   nature and importance of the reformation which had been effected among
   these people, the reader will be pleased to read it in the bishop's own
   words. It is as follows:

   "On Saturday, the 21st of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, we
   arrived safe, and found the mission family and the school all in good
   health; but was much fatigued myself, through affliction and warm
   weather, which was quite oppressive to me in crossing over the
   celebrated Sandusky Plains, through which the road lies.

   "In the afternoon we commenced visiting the schools, and repeated our
   visits frequently during the five days which we stayed with them. These
   visits were highly gratifying to us, and they afforded us an
   opportunity of observing the behavior of the children, both in and out
   of school, their improvement in learning, and the whole order and
   management of the school; together with the proficiency of the boys in
   agriculture, and of the girls in the various domestic arts. They are
   sewing and spinning handsomely, and would be weaving if they had looms.
   The children are cleanly, chaste in their manners, kind to each other,
   peaceable and friendly to all. They promptly obey orders, and do their
   work cheerfully, without any objection or murmur. They are regular in
   their attendance on family devotion and the public worship of God, and
   sing delightfully. Their proficiency in learning was gratifying to us,
   and is well spoken of by visitors. If they do not sufficiently
   understand what they read it is for the want of suitable books,
   especially a translation of English words, lessons, hymns, &c., into
   their own tongue.

   "But the change which has been wrought among the adult Indians is
   wonderful! This people, that walked in darkness, have seen a great
   light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
   hath the light shined.' And they have been called from darkness into
   the marvelous light' of the gospel. To estimate correctly the
   conversion of these Indians from heathenish darkness, it should be
   remembered that the Friends (or Quakers) were the first to prepare them
   in some degree for the introduction of the gospel, by patiently
   continuing to counsel them, and to afford them pecuniary aid.

   "The first successful missionary that appeared among them was Mr.
   Steward, a colored man, and a member of our Church. The state of these
   Indians is thus described by him, in a letter to a friend, dated in
   June last:"

   "The situation of the Wyandot nation of Indians when I first arrived
   among them, near six years ago, may be judged of from their manner of
   living. Some of their houses were made of small poles, and covered with
   bark; others of bark altogether. Their farms contained from about two
   acres to less than half an acre. The women did nearly all the work that
   was done. They had as many as two plows in the nation, but these were
   seldom used. In a word, they were really in a savage state.'

   "But now they are building hewed log houses, with brick chimneys,
   cultivating their lands, and successfully adopting the various
   agricultural arts. They now manifest a relish for, and begin to enjoy
   the benefits of civilization; and it is probable that some of them will
   this year raise an ample support for their families, from the produce
   of their farms.

   "There are more than two hundred of them who have renounced heathenism
   and embraced the Christian religion, giving unequivocal evidence of
   their sincerity, of the reality of a divine change. Our missionaries
   have taken them under their pastoral care as probationers for
   membership in our Church, and are engaged in instructing them in the
   doctrine and duties of our holy religion, though the various duties of
   the missionaries prevent them from devoting sufficient time for the
   instruction of these inquirers after truth. But the Lord hath
   mercifully provided helpers, in the conversion of several of The
   interpreters and a majority of the chiefs of the nation. The
   interpreters, feeling themselves the force of divine truth, and
   entering more readily into the plan of the gospel, are much more
   efficient organs for communicating instruction to the Indians. Some of
   these chiefs are men of sound judgment, and strong, penetrating minds;
   and having been more particularly instructed, have made great
   proficiency in the knowledge of God and of divine truths; and being
   very zealous, they render important assistance in the good work. The
   regularity of conduct, the solemnity and devotion of this people, in
   time of divine service, of which I witnessed a pleasing example, is
   rarely exceeded in our own worshipping assemblies.

   "To the labors and influence of these great men, the chiefs, may also
   in some degree be attributed the good conduct of the children in
   school. Three of the chiefs officiate in the school as a committee to
   preserve good order and obedience among the children. I am told that
   Between-the-logs, the principal speaker, has lectured the school
   children in a very able and impressive manner, on the design and
   benefit of the school, attention to their studies, and obedience to
   their teachers. This excellent man is also a very zealous and a useful
   preacher of righteousness. He has, in conjunction with others of the
   tribe, lately visited a neighboring nation, and met with encouragement.

   "On the third day after our arrival we dined with Between-the-logs and
   about twenty of their principal men, six of whom were chiefs and three
   interpreters, and were very agreeably and comfortably entertained.
   After dinner we were all comfortably seated, a few of us on benches,
   the rest on the grass, under a pleasant grove of shady oaks, and spent
   about two hours in council. I requested them to give us their views of
   the state of the school; to inform us, without reserve, of any
   objections they might have to the order and management thereof, and to
   suggest any alteration they might wish. I also desired to know how
   their nation liked our religion, and how those who had embraced it were
   prospering.

   "Their reply was appropriate, impressive, and dignified, embracing
   distinctly every particular inquiry, and in the order they were
   proposed to them. The substance of their reply was, that they thought
   the school was in a good state and very prosperous; were perfectly
   satisfied with its order and management, pleased with the
   superintendent and teachers, and gratified with the improvement of the
   children. It was their anxious wish for its permanence and success.
   They gave a pleasing account of those who had embraced religion, as to
   their moral conduct and inoffensive behavior, and attention to their
   religious duties. They heartily approved of the religion they had
   embraced, and were highly pleased with the great and effectual
   reformation which had taken place among them.

   "In the close they expressed the high obligations they were under to
   all their kind friends and benefactors, and in a very respectful and
   feeling manner thanked their visitors, and the superintendent and
   teachers, for their kind attention to themselves and to their children;
   and concluded with a devout wish for the prosperity and eternal
   happiness of them and all their kind friends. It was an affecting
   scene, and tears bespoke their sincerity.

   "To this school there are Indian children sent from Canada. Others
   which were lately sent were detained and taken into another school, at
   the rapids of Maumee, under the direction of the Presbyterians. An
   apology was written by the superintendent thereof to ours, stating that
   the detention was made on the presumption that our school was full, &c.

   "When we reflect upon the state of the Wyandots, compared with their
   former savage condition, we may surely exclaim, What hath God wrought!'
   The parched ground hath become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of
   water; the wilderness and the solitary place is made glad, and the
   desert blossoms as the rose.' The marks of a genuine work of grace
   among these sons of the forest accord so perfectly with the history of
   the great revivals of religion in all ages of the Church, that no doubt
   remains of its being the work of God.

   "That a great and effectual door is opened on our frontier for the
   preaching of the gospel to the Indian nations which border thereon, and
   that we are providentially called to the work, I have no doubt. The
   only question is, Are we prepared to obey the call? The success of our
   missionary labors does not depend on the interference of miraculous
   power, as in the case of the apostles, but on the ordinary operations
   and influences of the Holy Spirit, through the instrumentality of a
   gospel ministry, supported by the liberality of a generous people.

   "We have lately received an invitation from a distinguished officer of
   the government to extend our missionary labors to a distant nation of
   Indians. A gentleman of this state who has visited New Orleans has
   taken a deep interest in its favor; and from the great increase of
   population from other states, and the great probability of doing good
   at least among them, he urges another attempt. And from his influence,
   his ability, and disposition to minister to its support, we entertain a
   hope of success.

   "From a general view of our missions, and of what the Lord is doing by
   us, we certainly have abundant cause to thank God and take courage,'
   and to persevere faithfully and diligently in the great work, looking
   to the great Head of the Church, that he may bless our labors and crown
   them with success.

   "Yours in the bonds of the gospel of peace."

   Nor is the following account less interesting and illustrative of the
   power of gospel truth. It is from the pen of the Rev. G. R. Jones, who
   was present and witnessed the ceremony which he describes in the
   following words: --

   "At our late Ohio annual conference, held in Urbana, there were several
   of the red, and one or two of the colored brethren present, from the
   Wyandot mission at Upper San dusky. Several interviews took place
   between our general superintendents and them, during the sitting of the
   conference, at Bishop McKendree's room, at one of which I was present
   part of the time.

   "A few friends were invited to be present at this interview. As
   breaking bread together has been a token of hospitality and friendship
   among most nations, a cup of tea was prepared by the family, and at a
   suitable time they were waited on with it. Bishop McKendree, without
   any previous arrangement or design, appears to have been made a kind of
   master of ceremonies -- he was waited on first. The sagacity of the red
   brethren was quite observable; they kept their eye on him, and
   conformed in every particular. Jonathan, a man of color, (who has
   served the mission from the beginning as an interpreter, and who, while
   engaged in this work, became convinced of sin, and happily converted to
   God,) was one of the company; he modestly declined partaking with them,
   but, being pressingly solicited by Bishop McKendree, yielded. After the
   repast was over, the red brethren joined in singing several hymns in
   their own tongue, during which a number in the house within hearing
   crowded into the room, until there might have been as many as forty
   present; Mononcue (a chief) rose, and, approaching Bishop McKendree
   respectfully, held out the hand of friendship, which was cordially
   received, and a warm embrace took place; this appears to have taken off
   all restraint. Between-the-logs (another chief) followed his example,
   and they proceeded round to all in the room, while sighs and tears
   witnessed the feelings of most who were present; but they were sighs of
   gratitude and astonishment, and tears of joy. The spirit of hostile
   foes in the field of battle was lost in the spirit of harmony and
   Christian love, which appeared to fill the room. I have witnessed few
   scenes which carried stronger conviction to my heart of the truth and
   excellence of the religion of the meek and humble Jesus. I was ready to
   cry out and say, What hath the Lord wrought!'

   "A worthy gentleman, high in office and respectability, had received an
   invitation, and was present at the interview. It seems he had imbibed
   an opinion, which is perhaps prevalent among politicians, that it is
   impracticable to Christianize the aborigines of our country. He was
   placed in a part of the room farthest from the door. When the chiefs
   approached him all his unbelief appears to have, given way, his arms
   were open to give the friendly embrace, while the flowing tear bore
   witness to a reciprocity of feeling. He was heard to exclaim, a day or
   two afterward, I am fully converted!' At the close of the singing by
   the red brethren Bishop Roberts made a few appropriate remarks, and we
   all joined him in singing, at the close of which, from the fulness of
   his heart, he offered up a fervent prayer. We again joined in singing,
   and one of the chiefs, (Between-the-logs,) being called on, prayed in a
   very feeling manner, while every heart appeared to respond the hearty
   amen! The meeting was then drawn to a close."

   The mission now contained one hundred and fifty four members of the
   Church and sixty scholars, who were taught letters and the duties of
   domestic life.

   This year Mr. Finley, in company with some of the converted chiefs and
   an interpreter, set off on a visit to the Chippeways, on the Saganaw
   river, with a view, if practicable, to establish a mission among them.
   They at length arrived at the Wyandot reservation, on the Huron river,
   where they were cordially received and entertained by a white man
   called Honnes, who had lived with the Indians for many years, having
   been taken a prisoner when quite a lad. He was now supposed to be not
   less than one hundred years of age, could remember nothing of his
   parentage, nor of his days previous to his captivity, only that he was
   called Honnes. He was now much crippled and nearly blind, but was very
   intelligent and communicative. He sat upon a deer-skin, and, through an
   interpreter -- for he had lost all knowledge of his vernacular language
   -- he addressed our missionaries in the following manner "My children,
   you are welcome to my cabin; and I now thank the Great Spirit that he
   has provided a way for us to meet together in this world. I thank him
   for all his mercies to me. He has fed me all my life. He has saved me
   in the field of blood, and has lifted up my head when I have been sick,
   and, like a kind father, has protected and provided for me." These
   affecting remarks from this patriarch of the woods were listened to
   with great attention and respect, being interrupted now and then, by
   those Indians who were present, by the expression, "tough," which
   signifies, all true, and then the pipe of peace was lighted, passed
   around the company, and returned to the aged sire. This ceremony being
   ended, Mr. Finley informed him that, having often heard of him, he had
   come some distance out of his way to see him, and then proceeded to
   explain to him the gospel of Jesus Christ. The tears which coursed down
   his withered cheeks, while he listened with solemn attention to the
   words of truth, bespoke the deep feeling of his heart, and the lively
   interest which he took in the subject. The discourse being closed, he
   took Mr. Finley by the hand, and, calling for blessings on him and his
   associates, said, "I have been praying for many years that God might
   send some light to this nation."

   After hearing, the next day, some historical anecdotes of the Wyandots
   from this aged man, who had been for so many years shut out from
   civilized life and immured in the dungeon of heathenism, Mr. Finley
   bade him an affectionate adieu, and continued his journey in search of
   other lost sheep of the house of Israel. These men of the woods,
   however, were not forgotten by the Christian missionaries, but were
   sought out and provided with the means of salvation, the benefits of
   which some of them received. Of the destiny of Honnes, whose simple
   story is so affecting, I have not been informed, but trust the God of
   all the families of the earth did not forget him in his lonely retreat,
   nor refuse his prayers for more light to the nation. who had adopted
   him as a brother. He seemed, indeed, like the Nestor of his tribe, and
   to be preserved to this good old age to welcome the harbingers of peace
   and good-will to the borders of his land and nation.

   For that abandoned class of females who have been seduced from the
   paths of virtue by the wiles of the other sex, many efforts had been
   made by the pious and benevolent in the city of New York, as well as in
   other places where this destructive vice had become so predominant, but
   without any permanent effect. It seems, indeed, that among all the
   vices which infect mankind, this, when its corrupting sway has been
   once permitted to gain an ascendency, is the most inveterate, and of
   course the most difficult to eradicate. Not, however, entirely
   despairing of success in attempting to effect a reformation even among
   these unhappy subjects of seduction, a mission was undertaken this year
   for their special benefit, and the Rev. Samuel D. Ferguson was
   appointed to its charge. Though he labored indefatigably, in
   conjunction with some local preachers and exhorters who volunteered
   their services to aid him, and some good impressions were made upon a
   few, yet they were soon effaced, and they were compelled, after using
   every exertion to accomplish their object, to abandon their enterprise
   in despair; and though subsequent efforts have been more successful in
   a few instances in which reformations have been effected, it would seem
   that more powerful means must be resorted to before this
   soul-destroying vice can be banished from the community.

   In consequence of this failure in the primary object of the mission,
   the missionary, in the latter part of the year, turned his attention to
   some destitute portions in the west sections of Long Island, where he
   was more successful. Here he formed a regular circuit, and raised two
   classes of fifty-two members, which have continued to flourish, less or
   more, to the present time.

   As it was one object of our missionary societies to supply destitute
   places in the older settlements where the people were either unwilling
   or unable to support the institutions of religion, some such were
   either partially assisted from their funds or wholly supported for a
   season, as the case might be. Among others may be mentioned, as showing
   the good effects of this policy, the town of New Brunswick, in the
   state of New Jersey. This, though an old settled place, had been a
   barren soil for Methodism. Our preachers had long preached there
   occasionally to a feeble few, but under great discouragements. In 1821
   the Rev. Charles Pittman was sent there as a missionary, under the
   patronage of the Philadelphia Conference Missionary Society, and again
   in 1822. He met with much opposition, owing to the deep-rooted
   prejudices cherished against the peculiarities of Methodism. His
   congregation was small, not amounting to more than thirty for some
   weeks during the first year of his ministry. He and the little flock,
   however, persevered in the strength of faith and prayer until a revival
   of religion commenced, which terminated in the conversion of quite
   number of souls, so that in the month of February of this year they
   numbered about one hundred communicants. From that time the work has
   steadily advanced, and we have now a flourishing society and a
   commodious house of worship in that place.

   In many other places, too numerous to mention, the work of God
   prevailed in the older circuits and stations. On the New Bedford
   circuit, Mass., where a good work had been progressing for some time,
   in the month of August of this year it had extended for twenty miles,
   so that an entire new circuit had been formed, large enough to employ
   three preachers.

   The camp meetings continued to be held with profit to the souls of the
   people. At one held in the Ogeechee district, in the state of Georgia,
   not less than one hundred white and upward of forty colored people were
   made partakers of the grace of life. At one held in the same place last
   year a work of God commenced among the students of Tabernacle Academy,
   a literary institution under our care, and the reformation was
   advancing among the students this year most encouragingly.

   At five camp meetings held in the Baltimore district for this year the
   Lord poured out his Spirit, and about one hundred and twenty, white and
   colored, professed to find the pearl of great price, among whom were
   two females, one eighty and the other sixty years of age. The latter
   was a Quakeress, whose charming simplicity of manners and conversation,
   after her conversion, reminded one of the primitive days of
   Christianity. Such evidences of the power of grace were not unlike the
   Pentecostal showers of divine mercy, and they tended mightily to
   strengthen the faith of God's people, and to baffle the speculations of
   an infidel philosophy.

   We have already seen that the cause of education began to engage the
   attention of some of the annual conferences, and that two academies had
   been put in operation. This year I find on the Minutes of the Kentucky
   conference that John P. Finley was appointed to the charge of Augusta
   College, though I believe the college edifice was not erected until
   1825. Our brethren, therefore, west of the mountains have the honor of
   founding the first college in the United States under the patronage of
   the Methodist Episcopal Church; and I am happy to say that this
   institution has gone on prospering, though sometimes depressed from
   pecuniary embarrassments, shedding on that region of country the
   blessings of science and religion, greatly to the joy of its friends
   and patrons.

   Forty-four preachers were located, forty-seven returned supernumerary,
   and fifty-nine superannuated, and nine had died during the past year.
   These were, Philip Kennerly, Walter Griffith, John Dix, Samuel Davis,
   William Wright, William Ross, Alonson Gord, James Griggs Peal, and
   William Penn Chandler.

   A strong testimony is given in favor of these devoted men of God, that
   in their last days they maintained their integrity, triumphing in the
   hour of dissolution, and died in hope of the glory of God.

   Dr. Chandler [15] was appointed the presiding elder on the Delaware
   district in 1801, about the time the camp meetings were introduced into
   that part of the country, and his talents were peculiarly adapted to
   promote their objects. His zeal in the cause of Christ was ardent, and
   his talents as a preacher were more than ordinary, and often the most
   astonishing effects were produced under his powerful appeals to the
   consciences of his hearers. In consequence of his devotion to the
   cause, and the character of his talents, he exerted a commanding
   influence upon his district, winning the affections and inspiring the
   confidence of the people committed to his charge. The ardency of his
   zeal and intensity of his labors so exhausted his physical strength
   that in 1808 he was returned superannuated. In 1813 he received a
   location; but his warm attachments to his brethren in the traveling
   ministry led him back to the Philadelphia conference in May, 1822,
   where he remained in the relation of a superannuated preacher until his
   death.

   While preaching the gospel of the Son of God in the Ebenezer church, in
   the city of Philadelphia, on the first sabbath of May, 1820, he was
   suddenly prostrated by a paralytic stroke in his left side. Though he
   partially recovered from this, yet while at the island of St. Eustatia,
   whither he had gone for the benefit of his health, a second stroke
   deprived him of the use of his right side also, which took from him and
   his friends all hope of his recovery. He returned home, however, and
   lingered for about twelve weeks, when he exchanged a world of labor and
   suffering for a world of rest and reward. His expressions upon his
   death-bed were no less consolatory to his friends than they were
   satisfactory to himself. On being told by a friend that it was Sunday,
   he replied, "Go then to the meeting, and tell them that I am dying,
   shouting the praises of God!" Then, turning to his wife, he said, "My
   dear Mary, open the window, and let me proclaim to the people in the
   streets the goodness of God!"

   The following testimony is from an affectionate brother, a physician,
   who attended him much in his last sickness:

   "I visited Dr. Chandler daily during his last illness, which was of
   long continuance. His disease was an almost universal paralysis. The
   attack had at first been confined to one side, and after a partial
   recovery only of that side, the other became affected in like manner
   with the first. His mind as well as his body felt the effects of the
   disease, which at times caused a considerable derangement of intellect:
   but notwithstanding the confusion that was apparent in his mental
   operations, his constant theme was his God and the salvation of his
   soul; and on these subjects it was truly surprising to hear him
   converse. Although Dr. Chandler seemed incapable of rational reflection
   on other subjects, yet on that of religion, at intervals; he never
   conversed with more fluency, correctness, and feeling at any period of
   his life. He appeared to be exceedingly jealous of himself; and
   occasionally laboring under fear lest he might have deceived himself;
   and that he should finally become a cast-away; but of these
   apprehensions he was generally relieved whenever we approached a throne
   of grace, which we were in the habit of doing on almost every visit. In
   this state he remained until within a few days of his death, when the
   Lord was graciously pleased, in a most extraordinary manner, to pour
   out his Spirit upon his servant; and although his body was fast
   sinking, his mind, for two days, was restored to perfect vigor and
   correctness. During this time he seemed to be in the borders of the
   heavenly inheritance. He spoke of the glories, the joys, and the
   inhabitants of heaven as though he had been in the midst of them. He
   remarked to me, at the time, that he felt that his soul had begun to
   dissolve its connection with the body; and that there was a freedom, a
   clearness, and ease in its views and operations that was entirely new
   to him, and that he had never before formed a conception of -- ' in
   fact,' said he, I know not whether I am in the body or out of it.' Soon
   after this he sunk into a stupor, in which he remained to the last. On
   the sabbath following his funeral sermon was preached, by the author of
   these lines, to a large and deeply affected congregation, from these
   fine words of the apostle: But I would not have you to be ignorant,
   brethren, Concerning them that are asleep, and that ye sorrow not even
   as others which have no hope.'"

   The account of his death concludes in the following words: --

   "As a Christian, and as a Christian minister, W. P. Chandler was a man
   of no ordinary grade. In his deportment, dignity and humility, fervor
   and gentleness, plainness and brotherly kindness, with uniform piety,
   were strikingly exemplified. In the pulpit his soul was in his
   eloquence, his Saviour was his theme, and the divine unction that
   rested upon him, and the evangelical energy of his sermons, gave a
   success to his labors that has been exceeded by few. He studied to show
   himself approved unto God, a workman that needed not to be ashamed,
   rightly dividing the word of truth: and how good a proficient be was in
   this study, thousands who were blessed under his ministry can heartily
   testify, many of whom are living witnesses of the happy effects of his
   labors, while he is now reaping his eternal reward."

   Among others who departed to another world this year was John Steward,
   who first carried the gospel to the Wyandot Indians. Of his early life
   we have seen something in our account of the Wyandot mission. He seems
   to have been peculiarly fitted for his work. Sincere, simple-hearted,
   much devoted to the cause in which he had engaged, he adapted himself
   with a ready and willing mind to the condition and circumstances of
   those people, won their confidence and affection by his honest
   simplicity, and, by the blessing of God on his exertions, conducted
   them away from the absurdities of heathenism by the charms of gospel
   truth and love.

   His entire devotion to the interests of the mission, his intense
   application to meet its spiritual wants, and the privations to which he
   was subjected in his early residence among them, so wore upon his
   constitution, that in the course of this year it became manifest that
   his health was fast declining, and that the days of his pilgrimage were
   near their end.

   When so exhausted in his physical powers as to be unable to labor for
   his support, his temporal wants were provided for by his friends, about
   fifty acres of land, on which was built a cabin for his accommodation,
   being secured to him in fee-simple. Here he lived the remainder of his
   days, and on his demise the property was inherited by his brother. In
   this place, loved and honored by those who had been benefited by his
   evangelical labors, he lingered along the shores of mortality until
   December the 17th, 1823, when he fell asleep in Jesus, in the
   thirty-seventh year of his age, and the seventh of his labors in the
   missionary field. On his death-bed he gave the most consoling evidence
   of his faith in Christ and hope of immortality, exhorting his
   affectionate wife to faithfulness to her Lord and Master, and
   testifying with his latest breath to the goodness of God.

   In the contemplation of such a man, we cannot but admire the wisdom of
   God in the selection of means to accomplish his designs of mercy toward
   the outcasts of men. Born in humble life, destitute of the advantages
   of education, unauthorized and unprotected by any body of Christians
   when he first entered upon his enterprise, influenced solely by the
   impulses of his own mind, produced, as he believed, and as the event
   proved, by the dictates of the Holy Spirit, Steward sets off on an
   errand of mercy to the meandering savages of the wilderness. Here he
   arrives, a stranger among a strange people; and opens his mission by a
   simple narration of the experience of divine grace upon his heart, and
   of the motives which prompted him to forsake home and kindred, and
   devote himself to their spiritual interests, Having gained their
   attention, he explains to them, in the simplest language of truth, the
   fundamental doctrines of Jesus Christ, contrasting them with the
   absurdities of heathenism and the inummeries of a corrupted form of
   Christianity. [16] No sooner does the word take effect, than a violent
   opposition arises against this humble and unpretending servant of Jesus
   Christ, which he meets with Christian courage, and bears with the
   fortitude of a well-trained soldier of the cross. By the strength of
   God resting upon him, he manfully buffets the storms of persecution
   which raged around him, and calmly guides his little bark over the
   threatening billows until it is conducted into a harbor of peace and
   safety. Seeking for the wisdom that cometh from above, he is enabled to
   unravel the sophistry of error, to refute the calumnies of falsehood,
   to silence the cavilings of captious witlings, and to establish firmly
   the truth as it is in Jesus. Did not God "choose the weak things of the
   world to confound the things which are mighty?"

   Who does not look on with a trembling anxiety for the result, while the
   umpire was deliberating upon his fate, at that memorable time when he
   submitted his Bible and Hymn Book to the inspection of Mr. Walker, that
   he might determine whether or not they were genuine! And who can
   forbear participating in the general shout of exultation when the
   momentous question was decided in his favor! During these anxious
   moments the heart of Steward must have beat high amidst hopes and
   fears, while the fate of his mission apparently hung poised upon the
   decision of a question which involved the dearest interests of the
   nation for whose welfare he had risked his all! But the God whom he
   served pleaded his cause, silenced the clamor of his enemies,
   disappointed the machinations of the wicked, and gave a signal triumph
   to the virtues of honesty, simplicity, and godly sincerity. [17] In
   this triumph was fulfilled the inspired and inspiring declaration, "One
   shall chase a thousand, and two shall put ten thousand to flight."

   In all the subsequent conduct of Steward we behold a combination of
   those excellences which the Spirit of God alone can engraft and nourish
   in the human heart. "The excellency of the power," therefore, which was
   conspicuous in the life and conduct of Steward, reflected the rays of
   Him who had most evidently made him "a chosen vessel to bear his name
   unto the Gentiles" in the American wilds. Humble and unpretending as he
   was, his name will ever be associated with those men of God who had the
   high honor of first carrying the light of divine truth to the darkened
   tribes of our forests. And this record is made as a just tribute of
   respect to the memory of one whom God delighted to honor as the
   evangelical pioneer to the Methodist Episcopal Church in her career of
   usefulness among the long neglected children of our own wide domain.

   [6] May we not perceive in this system of aboriginal theology a
   semblance of the Scriptural account of a good and evil spirit, of holy
   and unholy angels? And have they not received it by tradition, obscured
   from one generation to another, until it has degenerated into these
   absurd notions of supreme and subordinate deities, who preside over
   their destinies?

   [7] Here is another relic of the highpriesthood among the Jews, and of
   the fire of the sacred altar. Has this been handed down by tradition
   from their fathers?

   [8] There is an error in the total number in the printed Minutes of
   385, the whole number there stated being 260,275.

   [9] McIntosh accompanied General Jackson in his campaign against the
   Seminole Indians. In a more private interview with Kennard, another
   Indian warrior, the latter related the manner in which the army was
   arranged at the time the descent was made. While he adverted to his
   command in one wing of the army, his eye sparkled with conscious pride
   at the recollection of the honor which had been conferred upon him. "In
   the middle," said he, was General Jackson on the right, McIntosh; on
   the left, me." This man was sick at the time the talk was had with
   McIntosh, which, however, was held near the bed on which he reposed. As
   Mr. Capers offered a dime to one of his children, he asked, "Is that
   little girl big enough to go to school'?" On being informed she was, he
   eagerly replied, "I have seven of them; and when you come back and
   begin your school I will send four." What a pity that a love of
   heathenism should have defeated the benevolent project of teaching
   these young immortals letters and the Christian religion! And much more
   that white men, born and educated in a Christian land, should have
   contributed to its defeat!

   [10] A small settlement of white people on the Indian lands here
   borders on a settlement of the Delaware Indians.

   [11] The Rev. Daniel Dorchester, who was the presiding elder of the
   district, in giving an account of this work, relates the following
   affecting and mournful incident: -- A young man, about eighteen years
   of age, who attended the meeting, was earnestly solicited by some of
   his young associates, who had recently embraced the Saviour, to seek
   the salvation of God. He constantly resisted their importunities,
   though they were seconded by preachers and other friends, by saying, "I
   will wait till I get home." On his way home he suddenly sprung from the
   wagon, and exclaimed, "Mother, I am dying! I am dying! I shall not live
   an hour! O that I had sought religion at the camp meeting!" Though a
   physician was procured, it was in vain. His flesh soon assumed a purple
   hue, and the next day, at about eight o'clock, P. M., he breathed his
   last.

   [12] The exact number of conversions was not reported.

   [13] There is an error in the printed Minutes for this year, there
   being 700 less in the increase than what appears in the Minutes.

   [14] When the writer of this history visited Detroit, in 1804, he
   obtained an old building called the "Council House" to preach in. On
   his second visit, while preaching in the evening there arose a
   tremendous storm, accompanied with the most vivid lightning and awful
   peals of thunder. He continued his sermon, however, reminding his
   hearers that this war in the elements was but a faint resemblance of
   that day when "the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the
   elements shall melt with fervent beat, the earth also and the works
   that are therein shall be burned up." He was afterward informed that
   some of "the baser sort" of the young men; after the candles were
   lighted, deposited some powder in them at such a distance from the haze
   that they supposed it would take fire and explode during the sermon.
   They were disappointed. The exercises closed without any explosion,
   because the candles had not burned down to the powder. These wags,
   after all was over, informed their associates of what they had done,
   and remarked, that while the peals of thunder were bursting over the
   house, they were fearful that the Almighty was about to hurl a bolt at
   their heads, as a punishment for their wickedness, and hence they sat
   trembling for their fate during the greater part of the sermon.

   [15] He was educated for a physician.

   [16] The Wyandots had been taught, to some extent, the religion of the
   Roman Catholics.

   [17] That the reader may understand the force of this allusion, the
   following incident is related. As Steward fearlessly denounced the
   absurdities of the Romish Church, and appealed to the Bible in support
   of his affirmations, those uninformed natives who had been instructed
   by Roman priests concluded that there must be a discrepancy between his
   Bible and the one used by the priests. To decide this question it was
   mutually agreed by the parties to submit it to Mr. Walker, the
   sub-agent. On a day appointed for the examination, Steward and the
   adverse chiefs appeared before the chosen arbiter. A profound silence
   reigned among the numerous spectators who had assembled to witness the
   scene. Mr. Walker carefully compared the two Bibles, and examined the
   hymns, each party looking on with intense anxiety for the result. At
   length the examination closed, and Mr. Walker declared to the assembly
   that the Bible used by Steward was genuine, and that the hymns breathed
   the spirit of true religion. During the whole transaction Steward sat
   with great tranquillity, eyeing the assembly with an affectionate
   solicitude, conscious that innocence and truth would gain the victory
   -- and when it was declared, the countenances of the Christian party
   beamed with joy, and their souls exulted in God their Saviour -- while
   their opposers stood rebuked and confounded. Though the assembly before
   whom Steward appeared in Upper Sandusky was less august and imposing
   than the one before whom Luther appeared, at the Diet of Worms, yet the
   question to be decided at the former was no less momentous to the
   interests of Steward and his party than the one which hung suspended
   during the admirable address of Luther was to him and his party. While,
   therefore, we may contrast in our minds the two personages who had
   submitted their cause to the decisions of others, we may not
   unprofitably compare them as being analogous in their consequences to
   their respective nations. Luther, towering above his fellows in
   learning, in eloquence, in piety, and in evangelical knowledge, was
   pleading the cause of truth before one of the most august assemblies
   ever convened to decide the fate of an individual. Steward, unlettered,
   rude in speech, limited in knowledge, though humble and devout, was
   silently looking on while his fate hung suspended upon the decision of
   a single man. How striking the contrast! And yet how analogous the
   cause and its results Luther, surrounded by princes, nobles, judges,
   bishops, and priests, awed by the presence of the emperor of all
   Germany and Spain combined, in one of the most magnificent cathedrals
   in the kingdom, stood firm in the strength of his God, and fearlessly
   advocated his cause in the face of that imposing array of civil and
   ecclesiastical authority which was leagued against him. Steward, on the
   contrary, accompanied by a few converted Indians, stood in the presence
   of the chiefs of the nation, most of whom had declared themselves
   adverse to his doctrines and measures, surrounded by an assemblage of
   rude barbarians in the rough cabin of an American Indian! Those
   Germans, however, who had embraced the principles of the Reformation
   were not more interested in the fate of Luther, than the trembling
   Indians who had embraced Christianity were for the result of the
   deliberations of Mr. Walker. But while Luther and his doctrines were
   condemned by a decree of the Diet of Worms, Steward was acquitted by
   the decision of the umpire to whom the question had been submitted.
   Luther, therefore, had to act in opposition to the highest authority of
   the empire, with the fulminating sentence of the pope ringing in his
   ears, while Steward went forth under the protection of the chief
   council of the nation, patronized by the Church of his choice,
   preaching Jesus and him crucified. Was not God's hand alike visible in
   each case? Nor was Steward more contemptible in the eyes of the pagan
   chieftains than Luther was in the estimation of the pope and his
   obsequious cardinals and bishops. And perhaps the time may come when
   the name of John Steward, as humble as were his claims in his lifetime,
   shall beheld in as high estimation by the descendants of the converted
   Indians, as is that of Martin Luther by the church which bears his
   name. They both had faults, because they were both human beings; but
   let their faults be buried beneath the same turf which hides their
   moldering bodies from human view, while their spirits, alike indebted
   to the blood of the Lamb for their deliverance from the slavery of sin,
   shall shine amidst the heavens for ever and ever.

   [18] There is an error in the printed Minutes of not less than 610,
   there being that number more in the real increase than is given in the
   Minutes.

   From the time that Dr. Coke had last visited us, in 1804, no personal
   intercourse had been kept up between the European and American
   connections, though friendly epistolary salutations had been exchanged.
   In 1820, as we have before seen, a delegate, Dr. Emory, had been sent
   to the Wesleyan conference in England, and had borne with him a request
   that a personal intercourse might be established, at such times as
   should be mutually agreeable. In conformity to this request our British
   brethren sent the Rev. Richard Reece as a representative to this
   General Conference, accompanied by the Rev. John Hannah and his
   ministerial companion. As these respected brethren had arrived in the
   city of New York in the month of March, they had spent the intervening
   time in visiting Boston, Lynn, New Haven, Philadelphia, and other
   places, where they had endeared themselves to the people by their
   Christian and ministerial deportment, as well as by their evangelical
   labors in the pulpit, and on the platform at several of our
   anniversaries.

   On the second day of the conference they were introduced by Bishop
   McKendree, when Mr. Reece presented the following address from the
   Wesleyan Methodist conference, which was read by the secretary, Dr.
   Emory: --

   "To the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church assembled
   at Baltimore, in the United States of America

   "Dear Brethren: -- The time has arrived which calls us, in pursuance of
   a resolution unanimously passed in the conference of 1820, held in
   Liverpool, to commission a deputation from our body, to attend your
   ensuing General Conference, to convey to you the sentiments of our
   fraternal regard and affectionate attachment, and to reciprocate that
   kind and friendly office which, on your part, was performed by the
   visit of one of your esteemed ministers, the Rev. John Emory.

   "The increased interest in your spiritual welfare which the
   establishment of this mode of direct and official communication between
   the two great bodies of Methodists has naturally excited in us, and
   reciprocally, we believe, in you, is to us the first proof of its
   beneficial tendency, and a cheering indication of its future
   advantages. For why should the ocean entirely sever the branches of the
   same family, or distance of place, and distant scenes of labor, wholly
   prevent that interchange of the sympathies of a special spiritual
   relationship which cannot but be felt by those who, under God, owe
   their origin to the labors of the same apostolic man, bear testimony to
   the same great truths before the world, and whose efforts to spread the
   savor of the knowledge of Christ, on our part, through the British
   empire, and on yours through the population of those rising states
   which have derived their language, their science, and their
   Protestantism from the same common source, Almighty God has deigned so
   abundantly to bless?

   "We received with heart-felt joy the messenger of your churches, the
   Rev. John Emory, bearing the grateful news of the progress of the work
   of God in your societies, and were refreshed by the expressions of your
   charity. We now commit the same charge to the faithful and beloved
   brethren whom we have appointed to salute you in the Lord, that nothing
   may be wanting on our part to strengthen the bond of brotherly love,
   and to call forth mutual and united prayers for each other's welfare,
   by a mutual knowledge of each other's state.

   We are on the point of closing the sittings of the present conference;
   in which the perfect harmony of the brethren assembled has afforded
   matter for the most devout and grateful acknowledgments to God, both as
   it is the indication and the result of that entire affection and unity
   which exist among our Societies throughout the united kingdom. Through
   the mercy of God, we have rest on every side; the discipline we
   received from our venerable founder is still enforced with unabated
   zeal, and, under a conviction of its agreement with the word of God,
   cheerfully observed; the value of those apostolic doctrines which
   distinguish us in the old and new world was never, we believe, more
   powerfully felt among us, and never were they with greater fidelity
   exhibited in out public ministry; and, as a crowning blessing, numbers
   are yearly added to us and to the Lord, and the light and influence of
   the gospel are yearly extending, by the divine blessing upon the labors
   of the brethren, into the still dark and uncultivated parts of our
   beloved country. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name
   give glory, for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake.'

   "You will also, dear brethren, partake of our joy in the success with
   which it has pleased God to attend the labors of our brethren in our
   different foreign missions.

   "The leading particulars of their state and prospects you will have
   learned from our Magazine and annual reports, and it will therefore
   suffice to state, that, in this department of the work of God committed
   to our charge, upward of one hundred and fifty of our preachers are
   employed; and that the zeal and liberality with which our people and
   the friends of religion generally co-operate with us in this hallowed
   work, answer to every call, and seem only roused to greater activity
   and enlargement as the sad condition of the pagan world is by new
   developments displayed before them. In the formation of regular
   missionary societies in your Church, to promote the universal
   establishment of the kingdom of our adorable Saviour, and to make all
   men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning
   of the world hath been hid in God,' we have greatly rejoiced; and in
   those encouraging dawnings of large success among the aboriginal tribes
   of your native continent, which have cheered the early efforts of those
   devoted men whom you have ordained to this blessed service. In addition
   to the doctrines in which we have been instructed, God has in his mercy
   given to us, as Methodists, a discipline adapted in a very special
   manner to missionary operations, to build up and establish infant
   religious societies among heathen, and to call forth in every place a
   supply of laborers for extending the work, and enlarging the cultivated
   field into the untilled and neglected wilderness. In the spirit of our
   great founder under God, who regarded he whole world as his parish, let
   the Methodists of Great Britain and America regard the whole world as
   the field of their evangelical labors; and, mindful of this our high
   vocation, let us enter in at every open door, trusting in God to
   dispose the hearts of our people to provide the means necessary to
   carry our sacred enterprises into effect; striving together in our
   prayers, that from us the word of the Lord may 'sound forth to nations
   and kingdoms of men, of all colors and climates, now involved in the
   ignorance and misery of pagan idolatry, and sitting in darkness and the
   shadow of death.'

   "More fully to declare unto you our state, and to be witnesses of the
   grace of God in you,' we have appointed, and hereby do accredit as our
   representative to your approaching General Conference, the Rev. Richard
   Reece, late president of our conference, and have requested the Rev.
   John Hannah, one of our respected junior preachers, to accompany him on
   this service. Beloved in the Lord and approved in Christ,' we commit
   them to the grace of God and to your brotherly affection. We earnestly
   pray that your approaching assembly may be under the special guidance
   and benediction of our common Head, and that all your deliberations may
   issue in the lasting union and prosperity of your numerous and widely
   extended societies; that you may increase in faith and love; and that
   your labors may, year after year, continue to enlarge and establish in
   the western world the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to
   whom be glory in the church throughout all ages, world without end.
   Amen.'

   "Signed in behalf of the conference,

   "H. Moore, President. "Sheffield, August 11, 1823."

   After the reading of the address, Mr. Reece delivered the following: --

   "Mr. President: -- The paper which has just been read is an expression
   of the sentiments avowed by the British conference, and in which I
   heartily concur; -- sentiments of affectionate concern for the
   prosperity and advantage of our brethren on this side of the Atlantic.
   It afforded us much satisfaction to receive from you, by your excellent
   deputy, the Rev. John Emory, an overture to more frequent intercourse
   and closer fellowship of brotherly love. Wesleyan Methodism is one
   everywhere, one in its doctrines, its discipline, its usages. We
   believe it to be the purest, simplest, most efficient form of
   Christianity that the world has known since the primitive days.
   Doubtless it is that which has had the sanction of Almighty God, in its
   rapid and extended success, beyond any other in modern times. It
   commenced, nearly a century ago, in the mother country, in one of her
   universities, with a few young men, chosen vessels, meet for the
   Master's use.' Then it was the cloud little as a human hand;' now it
   has sp read widely, and is still spreading, over both hemispheres,
   while its fertilizing showers are descending upon Europe, America,
   Africa, and Asia, producing fruit wherever they fall -- the fruit of
   knowledge and holiness. Methodism is our common property. We are alike
   interested in its preservation and diffusion. It is a sacred trust
   committed to us. It is a heavenly treasure which we have to dispense
   for the benefit of man. Its spirit is not sectarian, but catholic, and
   embraces Christians of every denomination who hold the essential truths
   of the gospel, and love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.' Your
   brethren in England were never more concerned to preach its
   distinguishing doctrines of justification by faith, the direct witness
   of the Spirit in the hearts of believers, and salvation from all sin in
   this life, with simplicity, fidelity, and zeal, than at present; --
   never more concerned to enforce its discipline with firmness and love,
   and to train up' a people in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;'
   -- never more careful that it do not deteriorate in their hands, but
   that it be transmitted, pure and entire, to faithful men' who shall
   succeed to their labors: .for which purpose they are anxious in their
   instruction and strict in their examination of the rising race of
   preachers, that these may be sound in the faith and lovers of our
   discipline. Many of them are all we can hope, young men whose
   profiting' has appeared unto all,' and to whom we can commit the
   deposit without anxiety; believing that they will obtain mercy of the
   Lord to be faithful.'

   "The result of this care and pains to preserve a pure and effective
   ministry has been and is seen in the blessing of God upon our labors,
   in an extension of his work through every part of our country, where
   great and effectual doors' are opening into new places, and the Lord is
   adding to his church daily such as are saved.' The members of our
   society are also improving in personal holiness and zeal for good
   works. They are more ready to concur with us in spreading the gospel
   abroad among heathen nations, as well as in tightening the cords' of
   our discipline at home. On the whole, our prospects were never more
   bright, nor had we ever more reason to be encouraged.

   "My opportunities of intercourse with you since my arrival in this
   country, together with the satisfaction I have had in attending two of
   your annual conferences, where I met with many of my American brethren,
   render this one of the most interesting periods of my life. I have
   witnessed the disinterested and laborious zeal which distinguishes your
   character and conduct. I have seen the fruit of your labors in the
   excellent societies in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Winchester, and
   this city. The doctrines and discipline of Methodism, when rightly
   applied, do, under the blessing of God, produce a Scriptural
   conversion, and form the genuine Christian character everywhere; and
   either at home or abroad, I find that a Methodist, who lives according
   to his profession, is a fellow-heir' of the same ' grace of life.' My
   prayer is, in accordance with the prayers of the body whom I represent,
   that you may go on and prosper, until, as the honored instruments of
   God, you have diffused gospel light and life through e very part of
   this vast continent, and every class of its interesting population,
   that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be everywhere glorified in
   his disciples. Amen."

   After the delivery of these addresses, and adopting rules for the
   government of the deliberations of the conference, the following
   communication was received from the bishops, and referred to
   appropriate committees "To the delegates of the several annual
   conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in General Conference
   assembled.

   "Dear Brethren: -- We have thought it advisable, at the opening of this
   General Conference, to communicate to you our? views in relation to
   some of the subjects which will properly come before you. Assembled as
   you are from various parts of the continent, and having been associated
   with societies of people not entirely the same in manners and customs,
   it cannot rationally be expected that your views On every subject
   should be uniformly the same. But, after candidly considering and
   discussing such points of interest to the Church as may require your
   attention and decision, we trust you will be able to unite in such
   measures as shall best serve for the prosperity of our Zion and the
   glory of God.

   "During the last four years we have not been favored with extraordinary
   revivals of religion, yet the work of God has gradually advanced, and
   we have had constant accessions to the Church, both of ministers and
   members, as well as an increase of circuits and districts. On the
   whole, we are happy to say, that amidst all our difficulties and
   obstructions, our prospects are encouraging, and we are permitted to
   hope that the great Head of the church will prosper our way and crown
   our labors with abundant success.

   "Your superintendents have endeavored to do what was in their power
   toward supplying the annual conferences with their official services,
   and have in most instances succeeded; but, owing to a failure of health
   in some of them, and to other uncontrollable circumstances, two cases
   have occurred in which the conferences were under the necessity of
   providing for themselves. And as the present health of your
   superintendents is more likely to decline than increase, while their
   labor will become every year more extensive, the subjects of
   administration, and the propriety of increasing the number of
   superintendents, will claim your early attention.

   "In the progress of this work new doors have been opened for the spread
   of the gospel, the borders of our Zion have been enlarged, and the
   number of circuits and districts so increased as to render it necessary
   that there should be some altercations in the form of the annual
   conferences. The way seems to be prepared for dividing some in order to
   form new ones, and for making some changes in the boundaries of others,
   so as to render them more convenient.

   "On the subject of Church government some of our friends have entered
   into various speculations, and it seems probable that memorials will be
   laid before you both from local preachers and private members. In order
   to give full satisfaction, as far as possible, on this point, it may be
   expedient to appoint a committee of address, to prepare circulars in
   answer to such memorials as may be presented.

   "In fixing the boundary lines of the annual conferences, it must not be
   forgotten that a part of our charge lies in Canada, beyond the limits
   of the United States. The situation of our brethren in that remote part
   of the country seems to present to view a subject distinct in itself;
   and the most judicious measures to secure their prosperity and welfare
   will claim the exercise of your united counsel and wisdom.

   "The Book Concern, considered in a moral and pecuniary point of view,
   is an important establishment in our Church, and will be, if proper
   exertions should be made in the circulation of books, not only a source
   of relief and support to our itinerant ministry, but a most effectual
   medium of conveying light and knowledge to the thousands among whom we
   labor, and perhaps to multitudes who do not attend our preaching. If
   any improvement can be made in its present plan of operation, so as to
   render it more extensively useful than it now is, it is desirable that
   it should be done.

   "In the course of your deliberations, the local district conference,
   the financing system, and the proper instruction and education of
   children, may require some attention, as well as several other subjects
   not necessary now to mention.

   "The importance of supporting the plan of an itinerant ministry, and of
   maintaining union among ourselves, cannot have escaped your
   recollection. They are subjects involving the vital interests of the
   Church, and our prayer is, that the wisdom of the Most High may guide
   us in such a course as shall be favorable both to the one and to the
   other."

   Among other things which engaged the attention of this conference, was
   the subject of a lay delegation. This came up for consideration by the
   presentation of a number of memorials and petitions from local
   preachers and lay members, praying for the General Conference to grant
   them "the right," as they termed it, of a voice in the legislative
   department of the Church. The committee to whom these documents were
   referred presented the following report, which, after an able and full
   discussion, was adopted by the conference: "Resolved, by the delegates
   of the several annual conferences in General Conference assembled,
    1. That it is inexpedient to recommend a lay delegation.
    2. Resolved, &c. That the following circular be sent in reply to the
       petitioners, memorialists, &c.,

   "Beloved Brethren: -- Several memorials have been brought up to the
   General Conference, proposing to change the present order of our Church
   government. By one or more of these it is proposed to admit into the
   annual conferences a lay delegate from each circuit and station, and
   into the General Conference an equal delegation of ministers and lay
   members:' or, to admit a representation of local preachers and lay
   members into the General Conference, to be so apportioned with the
   itinerant ministry as to secure an equilibrium of influence in that
   body:' or, that the General Conference call a convention, to consist of
   representatives from each annual conference and an equal number of
   representatives chosen by the members of each circuit or station, to
   form a constitution which shall be binding upon each member of our
   Church:' or, that a representation of the local preachers and the
   membership be introduced into the General Conference,' either by
   electing delegates separately, or that the membership be represented by
   the local ministry, they being elected by the united suffrage of the
   local preachers and lay members.

   "To these memorials, as well as to others praying the continuance of
   our government in its present form, we have given an attentive hearing
   in full conference, and, after much reflection, we reply: --

   "We are glad to be assured that there exists but one opinion among all
   our brethren respecting the importance of our itinerant ministry, and
   that they who desire a change, whether of the form of the General
   Conference alone, or of the annual conferences also, are moved to
   solicit it rather by their zeal to support the itinerancy than for want
   of attachment to it. They would relieve the preachers of the delicacy
   of fixing the amount of their own salaries; and as in this matter they
   could act more independently, so they would also provide more
   liberally.

   "We respectfully acknowledge the candor of brethren, who, although they
   intimate that it is unseemly for the preachers to determine their own
   salaries, yet do not pretend that their allowance is excessive, or that
   they claim a right to demand it. It is true that the deficiency of
   quarterage is so general, in such large proportions, that the
   conference collections and the dividends from the Book Concern and
   chartered fund have never been sufficient to supply it; and, indeed,
   the conference stewards usually settle with the preachers at a discount
   of from thirty to sixty per cent.

   "But we presume that these facts have been generally known; so that
   whatever injury may be sustained from the scantiness of our support is
   attributable, not to the improvidence of the rule which limits the
   amount, but to some other cause; and whatever that cause may be, we at
   least have no information that the people refuse to contribute because
   they are not represented. Indeed, it would grieve us to know this: for
   even though they should refuse to acknowledge us as their
   representatives in the General Conference, they cannot do less for the
   love of Christ than they would oblige themselves to do out of love for
   authority.

   "We rejoice to know that the proposed change is not contemplated as a
   remedy for evils which now exist in some infraction of the rights and
   privileges of the people, as defined to them by the form of Discipline;
   but that it is offered, either in anticipation of the possible
   existence of such evils, or else on a supposition of abstract rights,
   which, in the opinion of some, should form the basis of our government.

   "The rights and privileges of our brethren, as members of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, we hold most sacred. We are unconscious of having
   infringed them in any instance, nor would we do so. The limitations and
   restrictions which describe the extent of our authority in General
   Conference, and beyond which we have never acted, vindicate our
   sincerity in this assertion. By those restrictions' it is put out of
   the power of the General Conference to revoke, alter, or change our
   articles of religion;' or to revoke or change the general rules, or to
   do away the privileges of our members of trial before the society or by
   a committee, and of an appeal.' The general rules and the articles of
   religion form, to every member of our Church distinctively, a
   constitution, by which, as Methodists and as Christians, ye do well to
   be governed; and we, assembled together to make rules and regulations
   for the Church, most cheerfully acknowledge that the restrictions above
   mentioned are as solemnly binding upon us as the general rules are upon
   both us and you individually.

   "These restrictions are to you the guarantee of your rights and
   privileges;' and while we shall be governed by these, as such, we will
   also regard them as the pledge of your confidence in us.

   "But if by rights and privileges' it is intended to signify something
   foreign from the institutions of the Church, as we received them from
   our fathers, pardon us if we know no such rights -- if we do not
   comprehend such privileges. With our brethren everywhere we rejoice,
   that the institutions of our happy country are admirably calculated to
   secure the best ends of civil government. With their rights, as
   citizens of these United States, the Church disclaims all interference;
   but, that it should be inferred from these what are your rights as
   Methodists, seems to us no less surprising than if your Methodism
   should be made the criterion of your rights as citizens.

   We believe the proposed change to be inexpedient:
    1. Because it would create a distinction of interests between the
       itinerancy and the membership of the Church.
    2. Because it presupposes that either the authority of the General
       Conference to make rules and regulations' for the Church, or the
       manner in which this authority has been exercised, is displeasing
       to the Church, the reverse of which we believe to be true.
    3. Because it would involve a tedious procedure, inconvenient in
       itself, and calculated to agitate the Church to her injury.
    4. Because it would give to those districts which Ire conveniently
       situated, and could therefore secure the attendance of their
       delegates, an undue influence in the government of the Church.

   "With respect to lesser matters mentioned in the memorials, we
   respectfully refer you to the revised copy of the Discipline, forthwith
   to be published."

   The subject of education came before this conference with increased
   weight, and its importance was duly appreciated. The views of the
   conference in relation to this subject may be seen by the following
   extract from the report of the committee to whom it had been referred,
   and which met with the hearty concurrence of the conference: --

   "In considering this subject, your committee have been happy in
   believing that no arguments were necessary to impress this conference
   with a sense of its importance. The cultivation of the human mind, with
   a view to prepare it for the full exercise of its powers, and thereby
   to render it capable of answering the noble purposes of Its creation,
   may be reckoned among the first and greatest objects of a civilized
   community. The nature of this work is such that it requires an early
   commencement, and hence, in every enlightened nation, the education of
   children has been deemed necessary to the well-being of societies as
   well as individuals, and Christian people have held it among their most
   sacred duties. In the early establishment of Methodism, in the very
   beginning of our religious institutions as a Christian denomination, it
   was recommended to our people, made the duty of our ministers, and the
   fruit of it already realized sufficiently shows its utility.

   "Your committee, nevertheless, are fully impressed with the unpleasant
   fact, that this subject, so intimately connected with the vital
   interests of our Church, and with the salvation of so many thousands of
   souls, has been, and is at this moment, much neglected. While we are
   happy in believing that in many duties and labors we have done much
   more than several other denominations, we think it must be admitted
   that in the instruction of children some of them have exceeded us. And
   unless effectual measures can be adopted for securing proper attention
   to the rising generation under our care, we may anticipate unhappy
   consequences. The children of our hearers, and especially those of our
   Church members who have received baptism at our hands, may be
   considered as standing in a relation to us different from that of
   children in general, and fully entitled to all the attention from us
   which their age and situation require. If properly taught and educated,
   they will be prepared to become valuable members of our societies, and
   heirs of salvation; but, if neglected, we may expect them to become
   vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction.

   "On the subject of schools and seminaries of learning, your committee
   have obtained all the information their limited time and means would
   allow, and are of opinion that in this also we are deficient. In 1820 a
   resolution passed the General Conference, recommending that each annual
   conference should establish a classical seminary within its own
   boundaries and under its own regulations. Three or four seminaries have
   been established in conformity to this resolution, some of which are in
   successful operation, and it is, in the opinion of your committee,
   desirable that such an institution should flourish under the patronage
   of each annual conference in the Union.

   "Our Church contains multitudes of young men, not called to the
   ministry, who are qualified to teach, and many of whom would be more
   useful in such employment than they can be in any other. If these, as
   well as some of our local preachers, were made sensible of the good
   they might do our Church, even as teachers of schools, it is believed
   there would be no difficulty in supplying numerous schools of our
   country with teachers who would be in favor of the doctrine and
   discipline of our Church.

   "In closing these remarks, your committee beg leave to offer, for the
   consideration of this conference, the following resolutions, namely
    1. That, as far as practicable, it shall be the duty of every preacher
       of a circuit or station to obtain the names of the children
       belonging to his congregations, to form them into classes, for the
       purpose of giving them religious instruction, to instruct them
       regularly himself, as much as his other duties will allow, to
       appoint a suitable leader for each class, who shall instruct them
       in his absence, and to leave his successor a correct account of
       each class thus formed, with the name of its leader.
    2. That we approve of the resolution, passed in the General Conference
       of 1820, on the subject of seminaries of learning, and hereby
       recommend that each annual conference not having a seminary of
       learning use its utmost exertions to effect such an establishment.
    3. That it shall be the duty of every traveling preacher in our Church
       to keep in mind the importance of having suitable teachers employed
       in the instruction of the youth of our country, and to use his
       influence to introduce teachers into schools whose learning, piety,
       and religious tenets are such as we could recommend."

   As it was the constitutional duty of the managers of the Missionary
   Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church to report the doings of the
   society for the four preceding years, and the state of the funds, a
   report was presented by the treasurer, in which it appeared that the
   whole amount collected for missionary purposes, from the commencement
   of the society to that time, was $14,716 24«, and expended during the
   same period $11,011 40«, leaving a balance of $3,704 83_. This shows
   the feeble manner in which the society commenced its operations, and
   how long it was, notwithstanding the favorable manner in which it had
   been received by the annual conferences, before the people generally
   came fully into this great and good work.

   The managers conclude their report to the conference in the following
   words: --

   "In thus submitting to the General Conference a concise view of the
   transactions of the society, the managers cannot but express their
   gratitude to God for permitting them to be the humble instruments of
   aiding, in the management of the concerns of this society, in any
   measure, to extend the empire of truth and righteousness in our world;
   at the same time pledging themselves that, while the conference shall
   continue its operations for the noble purpose of evangelizing mankind,
   and of bringing them under the yoke of Jesus Christ, they will use
   their best endeavors to promote the same blessed object, by a faithful
   discharge of their duties as managers of the Missionary Society of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church.

   "New York, April 23, 1824."

   This report, together with the entire subject relating to missions, was
   referred to a committee, whose report, which was concurred in by the
   conference, was as follows: --

   "The committee view with pleasure the success attending our missionary
   exertions for the last four years; and think that we are loudly called
   upon to make our acknowledgments to the God of missions, for the
   special manner in which it has pleased him to own our efforts.

   "We began feeble, but God has strengthened us. We began fearful, but
   God has encouraged and assured us. So limited was our knowledge, and so
   numerous the claims upon our benevolence, that we scarcely knew to what
   particular point to direct our first attention. God, however, we humbly
   trust, has given a direction to our labors which has been highly
   important and beneficial, not only on account of immediate effects, but
   because a great and effectual door has been opened for the further
   prosecution of our missionary plans.

   "By avoiding that prodigality of expenditure so evidently seen in some,
   and that partiality of appropriation so manifest in others, and by
   observing economy and prudence in the management of our missionary
   affairs, we cannot fail, under the continued blessing of God, to
   succeed in the great work of evangelizing even the barbarous nations
   around us.

   "While an eye to economy is had in the appropriation of the funds of
   the institution, your committee are of opinion that the missions among
   our Indians ought to be prosecuted with increased vigor, laying a
   proper foundation for facilitating their future conversion in the
   education of their children; and that, for every missionary station,
   men should be selected as missionaries of hardy constitutions, of
   enterprising spirit, able and willing to labor, to sacrifice all for
   God and his cause.

   "But, in the midst of all these labors abroad, we should not forget
   that much remains to be done within the bounds of our respective
   conferences. While Zion is lengthening her cords and enlarging her
   borders, she ought also to strengthen her stakes, otherwise her
   enlargements will be her weakness. Let all the intervening sections of
   our country not inclosed in our fields of labor be examined, and, if
   Providence open the way, be occupied. Let missionaries be appointed,
   whose duty it shall be, not to wander over a whole conference, nor to
   preach generally, if at all, in old societies made ready to their
   hands, except in places where societies are very small; but to fix upon
   certain places still in the enemy's hands, and where there is rational
   ground of success, and then, by siege or assault, as the case may
   require, carry, in the name of the Lord, the strong holds of prejudice
   and sin. When this is done, let it be taken into a regular circuit, and
   the missionary be at liberty to pursue a similar course in other
   places. In this way, if we are steady and faithful to our purpose, we
   shall be enabled, by the divine blessing, ultimately to establish
   ourselves in all the sections of our country, until the power of our
   doctrines and the purity of our discipline shall renovate every part.

   "Your committee take the liberty further to state, that, in their
   opinion, an open and candid statement of the condition of the missions
   will be profitable, not only as it will convince the public that we
   mean to act in good faith, but because the information so communicated,
   from time to time, will gladden the hearts of thousands who have
   contributed, or may by this means be induced to contribute, to this
   benevolent object."

   The American Colonization Society presented certain documents to the
   conference, which were referred to a committee to consider and report
   thereon, and the following was concurred in by the conference: --

   "That the General Conference are not in possession of sufficient
   information relative to said society to render it proper for them, in
   their official capacity, to adopt any measures on the subject, farther
   than to recommend it" (that is, the colony at Liberia) "to the notice
   of the proper authorities of the Missionary Society of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, as a suitable field for sowing the good seed of the
   kingdom of God. Under this view of the subject, the committee recommend
   the adoption of the following resolution, viz.: --

   "That it is expedient, whenever the funds of the Missionary Society
   will justify the measure, for the episcopal to select and send a
   missionary or missionaries to the colony in Africa now establishing
   under the auspices of the American Colonization Society."

   It would appear from the above report that the American Colonization
   Society had not yet sufficiently developed its character and objects to
   enable the conference to act intelligibly and safely in furtherance of
   its views, or fully to endorse its measures. Its subsequent history,
   however, has removed the cause of those doubts which excited this
   hesitancy, and the conference has since, by sundry resolutions, entered
   heartily into the measure of endeavoring to plant a colony of American
   freemen of color, with their own consent, on the western coast of
   Africa. These things belong more appropriately to another period of our
   history, and will therefore be noticed in their proper place.

   Various enactments had been passed, from one General Conference to
   another, with a view to regulate the practice of slavery in the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, an evil this which it seemed impossible to
   control, much less to eradicate from the ranks of our Israel. From the
   organization of the Church, in 1784, slavery had been pronounced an
   evil, and, as before remarked, a variety of expedients had been
   resorted to for the purpose of lessening its deleterious tendencies
   where it seemed unavoidably to exist, to meliorate the condition of the
   slave where his civil bondage could not be removed, and entirely to
   prevent our preachers and people from holding slaves at all in those
   states and territories which permitted emancipation. Finding, however,
   that the evil was beyond the control of ecclesiastical law, as to its
   eradication from the Church, and wishing to render the condition of the
   slave as comfortable as possible, by holding his master immediately
   responsible to the proper tribunals of the Church for the manner in
   which he treated his slave, as well as to extend to the colored members
   of our Church all the privileges compatible with their civil and
   ecclesiastical relations, this General Conference so modified the
   section in the Discipline on slavery as to read as follows: --

   Question What shall be done for the extirpation of the evil of
   slavery?"

   Answer.
    1. We declare that we are as much as ever convinced of the great evil
       of slavery: therefore no slaveholder shall be eligible to any
       official station in our Church hereafter, where the laws of the
       state in which he lives will admit of emancipation, and permit the
       liberated slave to enjoy freedom.
    2. When any traveling preacher becomes an owner of a slave or slaves,
       by any means, he shall forfeit his ministerial character in our
       Church unless he execute, if it be practicable, a legal
       emancipation of such slaves, conformably to the laws of the state
       in which he lives.
    3. All our preachers shall prudently enforce upon our members the
       necessity of teaching their slaves to read the word of God, and to
       allow them time to attend upon the public worship of God on our
       regular days of divine service.
    4. Our colored preachers and official members shall have all the
       privileges which are usual to others in the district and quarterly
       conferences, where the usages of the country do not forbid it. And
       the presiding elder may hold for them a separate district
       conference, where the number of colored local preachers will
       justify it.
    5. The annual conferences may employ colored preachers to travel and
       preach where their services are judged necessary, provided that no
       one shall be so employed without having been recommended according
       to the form of Discipline."

   So it remains, unaltered, to the present time.

   The following are the resolutions of the committee on the episcopacy,
   which were adopted by the conference: --
    1. That we approve generally of the conduct of the superintendents in
       the administration of the government for the last four years; and
       that their zeal and exertions to promote the cause of God and the
       interests of the Church, under the circumstances in which they have
       been placed, merit the grateful acknowledgments of the General
       Conference and of the whole Church.
    2. That Bishop McKendree be, and hereby is, respectfully requested to
       continue to afford what aid he can to the episcopacy, consistently
       with his age and infirmities, when and where it may best suit his
       own convenience; and that the provisions of the last General
       Conference for meeting his contingent expenses be continued.
    3. That the episcopacy be strengthened by the election and ordination
       of two additional bishops at the present session of the General
       Conference.
    4. That it is highly expedient for the general superintendents, at
       every session of the General Conference, and as far as to them may
       appear practicable in the intervals of the sessions, annually to
       meet in council, to form their plan of traveling through their
       charge, whether in a circuit after each other, or dividing the
       connection into several episcopal departments, as to them may
       appear proper, and most conducive to the general good, and the
       better to enable them fully to perform the great work of their
       administration in the general superintendency, and to exchange and
       unite their views upon all affairs connected with the general
       interests of the Church.
    5. That the book agents and book committee in New York shall be a
       committee to estimate the amount necessary to meet the family
       expenses of the bishops, which shall be annually paid by the book
       agents out of the funds of the Book Concern, and that the above
       resolution be incorporated in the Discipline."

   In accordance with the third resolution in the above report, the
   conference proceeded, on the twenty-sixth day of its session, to ballot
   for two additional bishops. There were one hundred and twenty-eight
   voters present, and on counting the votes for the first time it
   appeared that no one had a majority. On the second balloting the Rev.
   Joshua Soule had sixty-five, and on the third the Rev. Elijah Hedding
   sixty-six, out of one hundred and twenty-eight votes. They were
   accordingly declared duly elected, and having signified their
   acceptance of the office, they were, after an ordination sermon by
   Bishop McKendree, at 12 o'clock on the 27th, consecrated by prayer and
   imposition of hands, Bishop McKendree acting as the officiating
   minister.

   The conference passed a resolution authorizing the bishops to appoint a
   delegate to visit the Wesleyan Methodist conference at its session in
   July of 1826. This, however, was not carried into execution, in
   consequence of which we had no representative from England at our
   conference in 1828.

   The affairs of Canada once more engaged the attention of the
   conference, but without coming to any conclusion satisfactory to the
   Canada brethren. A petition was presented from a portion of the
   preachers in the upper province, to be set off as an independent
   conference, with the privilege of electing a bishop to reside among
   them and superintend their affairs. The following resolutions contain
   the result of the deliberations upon this subject: --
    1. That there shall be a Canada conference under our superintendency,
       bounded by the boundary lines of Upper Canada.
    2. That a circular shall be addressed to our preachers and members
       included within the bounds of the Canada conference, expressive of
       our zeal for their prosperity, and urging the importance of their
       maintaining union among themselves.
    3. That a respectful representation be made to the British conference
       of those points in the late agreement between the two connections
       which have not, on the part of their missionaries, been fulfilled."

   As before said, these measures were by no means satisfactory to those
   in Upper Canada who were desirous of having a separate and independent
   church organization in that province. Accordingly, on the return of the
   delegates who had attended the General Conference, a spirit of
   dissatisfaction was widely diffused, [19] the local preachers were
   convened, a conference organized, and a declaration of their
   grievances, rights, and future mode of operations published and
   circulated. All this took place before the Canada annual conference
   assembled. On the assembling of the conference, however, in Hallowell,
   Bishops George and Hedding being present, mutual explanations made, and
   pledges given by the bishops to sanction measures for a separate
   organization in Canada hereafter, peace was measurably restored, and
   all things went on as heretofore.

   The constitutional term of the Rev. Thomas Mason, as assistant book
   agent, having expired, the Rev. John Emory, D. D., was elected to fill
   the vacancy, and Nathan Bangs was reelected as the principal.

   It was manifest to all that the increased duties of the preachers, in
   consequence of the introduction of sabbath schools, the organization of
   the Missionary and Tract Societies, and the increase of members in the
   larger towns and villages, rendered it expedient, that every part of
   the work might be duly and seasonably performed, that the circuits
   should be shortened, and that each thriving village should be
   privileged with preaching every sabbath, otherwise it was impossible to
   establish a permanent congregation, more especially in those places
   where other denominations had established congregations and a resident
   ministry. It had been long evident to many of our ministers and people,
   that, for the want of having a preacher stationed in all important
   places, we had lost much of the fruits of our labor, and must, unless
   an adequate remedy were provided, continue feeble, if not retrograde
   from the standing we had already attained. This subject, it seems,
   presented itself before the committee on the itinerancy, together with
   others which relate to the duties of the pastoral office; and the
   following resolutions, concurred in by the conference, will show the
   views which were entertained in reference to these matters: --
    1. That the superintending preachers be instructed so to lay out their
       work that there may be sufficient time allowed each preacher for
       the faithful and extensive discharge of all his pastoral duties, in
       promoting family religion and instructing the children.
    2. That all our preachers observe that order of public worship pointed
       out in the twenty-third section of our form of Discipline; and that
       in the administration of the ordinances, and in the service for the
       burial of the dead, they invariably use the form in the Discipline;
       and in dismissing the congregation, the apostolic benediction; that
       they also attend uniformly to the order prescribed in chapter i,
       section 24, in regard to singing the praises of God in our
       congregations.
    3. That the Lord's prayer be used upon all occasions of public
       worship, at the close of the first prayer, and that it be strongly
       recommended to all our people to introduce it into their private
       and family devotions.
    4. That the preachers be particularly examined on these several
       subjects at each annual conference."

   There were no less than five new conferences created this year, making
   seventeen in all.

   Before the conference adjourned, which it did on Friday, May 29th, to
   meet in the city of Pittsburgh, May 1, 1828, the following address to
   the Wesleyan Methodist conference was adopted

   "Dear Fathers and Brethren: -- In reciprocating the kind and
   affectionate sentiments contained in your communication to us, sent by
   the hands of those whom you had chosen to be the messengers of the
   churches, we feel an indescribable pleasure. Many are the associations
   that press upon us, and the emotions that affect us, in this pleasant
   interchange of affectionate regards. We look to England as the.
   birthplace of that man, who, under the guidance of Heaven, was the
   founder of a great and flourishing church. It was there that the infant
   societies were nourished, and it was thence that the word of God was
   sent forth, even unto us. After we had flourished for some time under
   your fostering care, a mysterious chain of providences led to a
   separation of our societies in this country from the mother Church. But
   the scion that was planted here has been watered and blessed of God;
   and though probably still inferior in solidity and strength, yet in the
   number and extent of its branches, and the abundance of its fruits, it
   vies with the parent stock. In this we rejoice, and are grateful to the
   great Head of the church, to whom alone the praise belongs. But it
   greatly increase our joy to know that our British brethren rejoice with
   us, and that the parent Church, with which we hope ever to be
   identified by the same holy doctrines and the same salutary discipline,
   is still flourishing, increasing, and abounding in every good work.

   "For this our increase of consolation we have been greatly indebted to
   our justly esteemed brother and father in the Church the Rev. Richard
   Reece, and to his associated companion, the Rev. John Hannah, whom you
   have sent to declare your state unto us, and the interest you feel in
   our prosperity. We received them as your messengers, and as brethren
   beloved. Their presence with us has drawn the cords of brotherly love
   still closer, has seemed to introduce you more immediately before us;
   and in all our intercourse with them, both social and public, we have
   been made to feel, more sensibly than ever, that in doctrine and
   discipline, in experience and practice, and in the great object of
   evangelizing the world, the British and American Methodists are ONE.
   And we devoutly pray that they may ever so remain.

   "We are, with you, dear brethren, endeavoring to maintain the purity of
   our doctrines, and are not conscious that we have suffered them in any
   instance to be changed or adulterated in our hands. As they are the
   doctrines which have proved to so many, both in Europe and America, the
   power of God unto salvation, we deem them to be the gospel of God our
   Saviour; and while he owns them we have never give them up. With you,
   too, we prize and practically vindicate the general rules of our
   Church, and the pristine institutions and usages of Methodism. We are
   also following you, though at an humble distance, in your missionary
   exertions. But such is the extent, and increasing extent, of our work
   here, that we cannot find means or men for foreign missions. The
   increase of our population is perhaps unparalleled, and it is widely
   scattered over an extensive continent. To keep pace with it, under such
   circumstances, requires much labor and much privation. In addition to
   this, the Lord, as you have heard, has opened for us a great and
   effectual door among the aborigines of our country. These we dare not
   neglect. They are our neighbors, and we must minister unto them; they
   have been injured, and we must make them reparation; they are savages,
   and must be civilized; heathen, and must be converted. All this shall
   be done if God permit. We have the work much at heart, and hope and
   pray for success. In addition to this, we have entailed upon us, in
   several of our states, a degraded and enslaved population, whose
   situation is making, if possible, a still stronger claim upon our
   Christian philanthropy. And, finally, the way seems to be opening for
   missionary exertions in Mexico and South America.

   "With these fields of labor in the midst of us and round about us, you
   cannot expect us to join you in the great and good work in which you
   are engaged in the East. Still we hope the tune is not far distant when
   we shall join hands on the Asiatic shores of the Pacific Ocean. We are
   constantly advancing in our labors toward the West, and you are
   extending in the East, not only on the continent, but over the islands
   of the sea. Is it chimerical then to suppose, that at some future day
   we shall have encompassed this earth, and girded it round with glorious
   bands of gospel truth? O no; faith says it shall be done. And this
   faith is not without works; certainly not on your part, for we hear
   from you that you are laboring assiduously in this great cause,
   imitating the illustrious example of enterprise and diligence which so
   eminently marked the great founder of Methodism. You aim at great
   things, and you accomplish them, We admire the exertions of your
   ministers, and the liberality of your people. In our labors as
   ministers we hope we are not far behind you; but, as a people, we do
   not yet equal you in active Christian benevolence. In this respect,
   however, we are improving. Our people are becoming more alive to the
   importance of greater and more systematic exertions in the cause of the
   Church. And while we are enlarging our work, and multiplying our
   numbers, we trust we have not forgotten that the great design of
   Methodism, the ultimate end of all its institutions, is to raise up and
   preserve, in the midst of a sinful world, a holy people. Without this,
   numbers and influence are nothing. We deprecate more than any thing
   else that ecclesiastical pride which builds itself up upon the numbers
   and popularity of the church, while that church is sinking in the
   spirit and tone of its divine life. From such a state of things, we on
   both sides of the water are doubtless united in saying, Lord, preserve
   us; make us holy, and make us instrumental in spreading holiness
   throughout the earth.

   "We congratulate you, dear fathers and brethren, on the general
   prosperity that attends you, both in your labors at home and in your
   missions abroad; but especially on account of the perfect harmony which
   you inform us prevails among you; and we pray that it may ever
   continue. Of ourselves, though we are not able to say quite as much,
   yet in our present General Conference, which is now nearly closing,
   amidst some differences of opinion concerning the modes of
   administration, we find that we harmonize in the essential principles
   of Methodism. From this we are encouraged to hope, as intimated in his
   parting advice to us by your esteemed messenger, the Rev. Mr. Reece,
   that our minor differences of opinion on other subjects will soon be
   swallowed up in our attachment to the common cause. You too, in former
   days, have had your difficulties; but those days have passed by, and
   peace and union now cheer you with their benignant rays. And we are
   hoping that, before we shall have arrived at your age and maturity as a
   church, we shall overcome any little difficulties that may now attend
   us.

   "Brethren, pray for us. And may the God of peace dwell with us, and
   dwell with you. Finally, may this great army of the faithful, who in
   two grand divisions are now carrying on the warfare in both
   hemispheres, so acquit themselves in the church militant below, as
   ultimately to unite with the church triumphant on high, where no ocean
   shall roll between, and no reciprocal messengers of love shall be
   needed to recount their victories and triumphs.

   "We are, dear fathers and brethren, yours in the bonds of ministerial
   labor and Christian love.

   "Signed in behalf of the conference, "Enoch George, President.
   "Baltimore, May, 1824."

   "NOTE. -- In the address sent to England a few verbal alterations were
   made, which should have been inserted in this, but were inadvertently
   omitted. This, however, is substantially the same with the one sent."

   N. B. The above address was written by the Rev. Wilbur Fisk.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] It is probably due to the interests of truth, as well as to the
   characters of the living and the dead, to say, that the chief agent of
   this movement was the Rev. Henry Ryan, who afterward withdrew from the
   Church, and attempted to establish a separate party.

CHAPTER 8

    From the Close of the General Conference of 1824 to the Commencement of that
    of 1828

  1824

   Having, in the preceding chapter, detailed the doings of the General
   Conference at its last session, we will now proceed to notice the
   movements of the Church in her various departments of labor for the
   year 1824.

   This year the Rev. Charles Elliot was appointed as an assistant to Mr.
   Finley on the Wyandot mission. Through their united labors the work of
   God spread both among the adults and the children of the school.

   The mission was visited this year by Bishops McKendree and Soule, who
   made a thorough examination of the premises, the state of the
   Mission-church, and school; and the report of their interview with the
   converted chiefs gave a most gratifying view of the general aspect of
   things.

   Through the influence of these labors, and that of the missionaries who
   had the immediate charge of the establishment, the number of Church
   members had increased this year to one hundred and sixty, and the
   school, now under the care of William Walker, the subagent, a man fully
   competent to his work, was in a prosperous condition. The farm also was
   improving, and yielding a partial supply for the consumption of the
   mission family. And what contributed mightily to the prosperity and
   stability of the work, while it gave irrefutable evidence of its depth
   and genuineness, spirituous liquors were, by a solemn decree, banished
   from the nation. Benevolent individuals, excited by reading the good
   news of this great work, as well as auxiliary missionary societies,
   poured forth their stores to aid the cause of Indian missions.

   The mission among the Mohawks, in Upper Canada, was equally prosperous.
   The particulars, however, relating to this and other missions in that
   province, will come more properly under subsequent dates.

   Since the commencement of the Missionary Society, most of the new
   ground which was brought under cultivation was through the medium of
   missionaries, as well in the older parts of the country as in the new
   settlements in the west and southwest, though in most instances but a
   partial support was received from the society.

   This year the Rev. George Pickering was sent to form a new circuit in
   Newburyport and Gloucester, in Massachusetts, a region of country
   hitherto inaccessible to Methodist preachers, except flow and then to a
   transient visitor. His labors were accompanied with an outpouring of
   the divine Spirit, and about one hundred souls were brought to Christ
   in the course of the year; and thus a foundation was laid for continued
   preaching, the people soon contributing to their own support.

   The Rev. John Lindsey was appointed as a missionary to South Hadley and
   Sunderland, Massachusetts, where he labored with such success that the
   following year the mission was taken into the regular work.

   Piscataquis, in Maine, was occupied as missionary ground by the Rev.
   Oliver Beale, and at the end of the second year it was included in the
   regular work, with a membership of eighty souls as the fruit of his
   labors.

   The work of God in the various domestic missions mentioned under date
   of last year was in delightful progress, and was extending in various
   directions among the new and destitute settlements. Nor were the older
   parts of our work without the reviving influences of the Spirit of God.
   In various parts of Delaware state, in New Jersey, the Susquehannah and
   Ontario districts, in the bounds of the Genesee conference, the New
   Haven and Rhinebeck districts, New York conference, there were
   encouraging revivals of the work of God, begun generally through the
   agency of camp meetings, and then carried forward by a faithful
   attention to the means of grace in the circuits and stations.

   In Telfair county, in the state of Georgia, where religion had been at
   a low ebb for several years, the work of God commenced at a camp
   meeting held near the fork of the Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers, and
   thence spread in various directions through the adjacent neighborhoods.
   The presiding elder, the Rev. John J. Triggs, relates the following
   anecdote respecting a Baptist preacher who attended the meeting and
   participated in its exercises: -- "In the midst of the work he arose on
   the stand, and declared to the congregation that he had no doubt but
   this was the work of God; and warned the people, especially professors
   of other denominations, of the dangerous consequences of opposing God's
   work and of fighting against him. He then told them that he felt as
   solemn as death, and, lifting up his eyes and hands toward heaven,
   prayed God to send holy fire among the people. An awful solemnity
   rested on the assembly, and the power of the Highest overshadowed them.
   Some fell to the ground, and others cried aloud for mercy." The meeting
   resulted in the conversion of thirty-four, and a number returned to
   their homes under deep conviction for sin, resolved on a reformation of
   heart and life.

   The cause of education was daily advancing from one annual conference
   to another, and exerting an enlightening influence both on the young
   and the old. This year an academy was established in Cazenovia, in the
   bounds of the Genesee conference, a portion of our country fast
   increasing in population, wealth, and civil and religious enterprise.
   It was incorporated by the state legislature, and opened its doors for
   the education of youth of both sexes; and such has been its prosperity,
   that it has continued, enlarging its dimensions and extending the
   sphere of its influence, from that day to this, much to the credit of
   its founders and patrons, and greatly to the advantage of the rising
   generation. This, as well as the others which have been named, was
   brought strictly under a religious influence, so that the principles of
   Christianity might be embodied in the heart, as far as practicable,
   simultaneously with the growth of literature and science. And the pious
   objects of its patrons have been in a good degree realized in the
   conversion, from time to time, of quite a number of the students.

   In proportion to the increase of preachers the number of locations was
   diminished, there being this year only forty-eight; whereas, as might
   be expected, the number of supernumeraries and superannuated was
   gradually increasing in nearly all the annual conferences, there being
   this year of the former forty-three, and of the latter sixty-seven.
   Three had been expelled and nine had died during the past year. These
   last were, Charles Trescott, David Gray, John Wallace, Joseph Kinkaid,
   Peyton Anderson, Enoch Johnson, Richard McAllister, Mordecai Barry,
   Louis R. Fetchtig, and James Akins. It is no slight evidence of the
   truth and excellence of the gospel, that it enables its advocates to
   die in the full possession of its promised blessings. Of the
   above-mentioned brethren it is recorded that, having discharged their
   Christian and ministerial duties with fidelity, they all made a
   peaceful and triumphant exit from time to eternity, thus sealing the
   truths they had preached to others with their own lips in that most
   trying hour.

   Of Peyton Anderson, particularly, excellent things are said. He was
   born February 9th, 1795, in Chesterfield county, Virginia. Favored with
   the advantages of a good education in his youth, and being brought
   under the influence of gospel truth, at an early age he was made a
   partaker of pardoning mercy by faith in Jesus Christ. In his nineteenth
   year he commenced the work of an itinerant minister, and gave early
   indications of those talents as a preacher, and of that zeal in the
   cause of God, which afterward distinguished him in his short career of
   usefulness. In his public exercises, as well as in his private
   intercourse, he was remarkable for the seriousness of his manner,
   arising, no doubt, from the sincerity of his heart, and his deep
   devotion to the cause of God.

   He had a discriminating mind, and could therefore easily distinguish
   between truth and error, and nicely balance the relative claims of the
   several objects which were lawful for mankind to pursue. And his deep
   solemnity in the pulpit, his ready command of appropriate language, the
   fervor of his spirit, and evident sincerity of purpose, gave an
   impressiveness to all his discourses, which fastened the truths he
   uttered upon the hearts of his hearers. Though comparatively young in
   Christian experience and in the ministry of the word, yet he had
   learned much in the school of Christ, having passed through some severe
   struggles of mind, and wrestled in the strength of mighty faith and
   prayer against the violence of temptation, in which he was "more than a
   conqueror through Him who had loved him." He was therefore able to
   administer spiritual consolation to those who were in trouble, and to
   admonish such of their danger who were "wrestling against
   principalities and powers," as well as to point them to the only source
   whence their help was to be derived.

   Having drunk deeply at the fountain of divine love, his heart expanded
   with benevolent feelings toward mankind generally, for whose salvation
   he longed and labored with all diligence. Hence the Missionary Society
   found in him a warm friend and zealous advocate, and he was
   instrumental in promoting its noble objects by the formation of branch
   societies, and by stirring up a spirit of liberality among the people
   of his charge. And what rendered his precepts more weighty and
   influential, they were constantly enforced by his own example, both as
   respects the piety of his heart, the uniformity of his life, and the
   burning charity with which he exemplified the living principle of his
   faith.

   In his last sickness and death the graces of Christianity shone out
   with luster, and eclipsed in his view all the fading glories of this
   world. While his friends were standing around his dying bed, and
   watching with anxious hearts the issue of his conflict, and beheld the
   fitful ebbings and flowings of animal life, he said to them, in the
   language of faith and hope, "Farewell, brethren. When we meet again it
   will be in heaven." He thus ended his mortal career August 27, 1823, in
   the twenty-ninth year of his age, and tenth of his public ministry.

   Thus a bright light in the church militant became extinguished ere it
   had attained its meridian splendor. Mysterious are the ways of
   Providence! Had our brother Anderson lived to the common age of man,
   and gone on improving as he had begun, under the smiles of his heavenly
   Father, he doubtless would have risen to eminence in the church of God,
   and been a great blessing to his fellow-men. But He who "sees the end
   from the beginning," and whose "thoughts are not as our thoughts," in
   thus fulfilling the original decree denounced upon fallen man, in
   calling his servant to his eternal reward in early life, manifested his
   sovereign right over the work of his hands, and challenged the pious
   submission of his people to the wisdom and goodness of his
   dispensations.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This Year: 280,427; Last Year: 267,618;
   Increase: 12,809 -- Colored This Year: 48,096; Last Year: 44,922;
   Increase: 3,174 -- Total This Year: 328,523; Last Year: 312,540 --
   Increase: 15,983 -- Preachers This Year: 1,272; Last Year: 1,226;
   Increase: 46.

  1825

   A work of grace commenced this year among the Mississauga Indians in
   Upper Canada. These were among the most degraded of all the Indian
   tribes in that country. From their habits of intercourse among the
   depraved whites, they had bartered away their land for intoxicating
   liquor, had debased themselves by intemperance, and were consequently
   lazy, idle, poor, and filthy to a most disgusting degree. They seemed,
   indeed, to be abandoned to a most cruel fate.

   Among others who had embraced the Lord Jesus during the work among the
   Mohawks was Peter Jones, a half-breed, his mother being a Mississauga
   and his father an Englishman. Mr. Jones, Peter's father, had been the
   king's surveyor, and his occupation leading him much among the Indians,
   during the days of his vanity he formed an intimacy with two Indian
   women, the one a Mohawk princess and the other a Mississauga woman.
   About the year 1801, Mr. Jones, under the Methodist ministry, was
   awakened and converted to God. He then felt it his duty to repudiate
   one of his women, and he separated himself from the mother of Peter,
   the Mississauga, and married the other, who also embraced religion, and
   became a pious member of the Church. Peter followed his mother into the
   woods, and remained with his tribe until he was about twelve years of
   age, when his father brought him from the wilderness and sent him to an
   English school. While here, through the preaching of the gospel, he
   also was brought from darkness to light; and, understanding both
   languages, he was at first employed as an interpreter, and finally
   became eminently useful as a minister of the Lord Jesus.

   Feeling, after his conversion, for the salvation of his wretched tribe,
   he hasted away to them, and told them what great things God had done
   for his soul. This had a powerful effect upon their minds, and led them
   to attend the meetings on the Grand river.

   A relative of Peter Jones, one of their chiefs, while attending these
   meetings, was led to the Lord Jesus for salvation, and his family soon
   followed his steps. Others followed their example, and, through the
   pious exertions of this converted chief and Peter Jones, a reformation
   was effected this year among these degraded Mississaugas, of such a
   character, so thorough and genuine, that all who beheld it were
   astonished, and could not but acknowledge the hand of God. They
   abandoned the use of intoxicating liquor, forsook their heathenish and
   immoral practices, were baptized and received into the communion of the
   Church, and demonstrated, by their subsequent conduct, that the work
   was indeed the work of God. A white man, who had made his house the
   resort for drunken whites and Indians, seeing the visible change in the
   temper and conduct of these Indians, could but acknowledge the finger
   of God, was struck under conviction, became a sincere convert, banished
   from his house his drunken companions, became sober and industrious,
   and devoted both himself and his house to the service of God. The whole
   number converted at this time was fifty-four, seven of whom were
   whites.

   About the same time that this good work was going on so gloriously
   among the Mississaugas, a similar work commenced among a branch of the
   Delawares and Chippeways, who were settled at Muncytown, on the river
   Thames. This work began through the instrumentality of a Mohawk by the
   name of Jacob, who had raised himself to respectability among them by
   his sober and industrious habits. Until he heard the truths of the
   gospel he thought himself a very good and happy man, and was so
   considered by his brethren; but when the light of divine truth shone
   upon his mind he saw himself a sinner against God, his fancied goodness
   and happiness fled, and he rested not until he found peace with God
   through faith in the Lord Jesus. No sooner did this great change take
   place in Jacob's heart than he went among his brethren, who were
   wallowing in the mire of iniquity and heathenish practices, addressing
   them from one cabin to another, warning them, in the most affectionate
   manner, of the danger to which they were exposed, and beseeching them
   to be reconciled to God. "The Great Spirit," said he, in imperfect
   English, "is angry. You must die. Now consider where the wicked man
   must go. We must be born new men. Our heart new. His Spirit make us new
   heart. Then, O! much peace, much joy."

   Another among the first converts was an Indian of a very different
   character, and therefore the change was the more apparent and
   convincing. He was so given up to intoxication that he would barter any
   thing he had for vile whisky. At one time he offered his bullock for
   whisky, and, because his neighbors would not purchase it, in a violent
   rage he attempted to destroy the creature. At another time, having sold
   his clothes from his back for whisky, he stole from his wife the seed
   corn she had carefully preserved for planting, and offered it for the
   "fire waters," but was prevented from thus robbing his wife of the
   means of future subsistence by one of our friends, who purchased it and
   returned it to the squaw, upon whose labor in the field the family
   chiefly depended for bread. But even this man, vile as he was, who, in
   his drunken fits, was one of the most quarrelsome wretches that could
   haunt a human habitation, became reformed by the power of the gospel.
   That his reformation was thorough, was evidenced by the soberness,
   piety, and industriousness of his subsequent life. The conversion of
   two such men had a most powerful effect upon the whole tribe. Many of
   them embraced the gospel, and a school was soon established for the
   education of their children and youth.

   The labors of Peter Jones were highly useful in conducting these
   missions. He interpreted for the missionaries, and often addressed his
   Indian brethren, from the fulness of his own heart, with great effect.
   Many were the objections which the pagan Indians raised against the
   gospel, some of them founded in truth, and some from false
   representations circulated among them by the enemies of Christianity.
   These objections were obviated by distinguishing between real and
   nominal Christians, and by showing that the latter disgraced themselves
   by abusing the holy doctrines and high privileges to which they were
   called, and in which they professed to believe. It was, indeed, painful
   to be obliged to concede the fact, that hitherto the Indians had been
   imposed upon by the cupidity of white men, under the garb of
   Christianity; but this conduct was disclaimed and condemned by the
   missionaries, and the example of those who now came among them, and of
   the new converts, was presented as an ample refutation of all the
   slanderous representations of their adversaries. This silenced the
   clamor, and gave confidence to the friends of the cause.

   Several attempts had been made, but with little success hitherto, to
   establish Methodism in the city of New Orleans, a place which needed
   the reforming influence of the gospel as much, perhaps, as any on the
   continent.

   This city, which is now equal in importance, in a commercial point of
   view, to any in the United States, was first settled by the French,
   toward the close of the seventeenth Century, and the Roman Catholic
   religion was incorporated with its civil regulations. The progress of
   the settlement, like all the others in that region of country, for a
   number of years was extremely slow, owing to a variety of causes, but
   chiefly to the wars between France and Spain, to the unhealthiness of
   the climate, and the want of industry and enterprise among the original
   settlers. In 1763, that part of Louisiana west of the Mississippi and
   Pearl rivers, of which New Orleans was the capital, was ceded to Spain,
   and so remained until 1801, when it passed into the hands of the French
   republic, from whom it was transferred, in 1804, by purchase, to the
   United States. At this time the population, chiefly French Roman
   Catholics, numbered about twelve thousand; but from that period the
   increase of its citizens was much more rapid, by emigrants from various
   parts of the Union, so that, at the time of which we now speak, there
   were probably not less than forty thousand. These Anglo-Americans,
   mingling with the Creoles of the country, gradually introduced their
   habits and modes of living, as well as their religious tenets.

   But though New Orleans was thus early settled, and possessed so many
   local advantages for commerce, as before said, its progress was slow,
   and the population were encumbered with all those embarrassments
   arising out of the peculiarities of the Roman Catholic religion. In
   1815, three years after the memorable victory of the American army
   under General Jackson, the City contained about thirty-six thousand
   inhabitants, most of whom were descendants of the French and Spaniards.
   And until about the year 1820, when a Presbyterian church was erected,
   there was no place of worship besides the two Roman Catholic churches.
   It is said, indeed, that the sabbath was generally desecrated by
   profane sports and plays, the principles of morality exceedingly
   relaxed, pure religion little understood, and its precepts less
   exemplified in practical life.

   Among others who were lured to New Orleans for the purposes of traffic
   from the other states were some members of our Church, who spent the
   winter months in the city, but, on account of the insalubrity of the
   climate, retreated to their former places of abode during the heat of
   summer. These, however, beholding the degraded state of society, and
   feeling the deleterious influence of such a general inattention to
   religion, called upon the authorities of the Church for help.
   Accordingly, in the year 1819, the Rev. Mark Moore was sent to New
   Orleans, and he preached, under many discouraging circumstances, to a
   few in a room which was hired for that purpose, and some ineffectual
   efforts were made to build a church. In 1820 the Rev. John Manifee was
   sent as a missionary to New Orleans, and in the same year the place was
   visited by the Rev. Ebenezer Brown, who, being disappointed in his
   attempts to gain access to the French population in Louisiana, assisted
   Mr. Manifee in preaching to an English congregation in t he city. From
   this time until 1824 New Orleans seems to have been forsaken by the
   Methodist preachers thinking probably that it was useless to spend
   their strength to so little purpose, for I find no returns of any
   members of the Church until the year 1825. In 1824 the Rev. Daniel Hall
   stands as a missionary for New Orleans, but the prospect was yet but
   gloomy.

   This year, 1825, the Mississippi district was placed in charge of the
   Rev. William Winans, whose eminent talents as a preacher, and
   indefatigable labors as a presiding elder in that part of the country,
   gave a more vigorous impulse to the work of God; and New Orleans was
   blessed with the labors of the Rev. Benjamin Drake, who was
   instrumental in reviving the hopes of the few pious souls who prayed
   and sighed for the salvation of Israel in that place; for we find that
   in 1826 there were returned on the Minutes of conference eighty-three
   members, twenty-three whites and sixty colored. But still the work of
   God went on slowly, the preachers having to contend with a host of
   opposition from without and feebleness within the Church, with the
   unhealthiness of the climate, and the want of suitable accommodations
   for holding their meetings. The next year, however, the society had
   increased to one hundred in all. From this time the work has steadily
   advanced, and they have finally succeeded, by struggling bard with
   difficulties of various sorts, in erecting a large and elegant house of
   worship, so that in 1835 they numbered six hundred and twenty-five
   members, five hundred and seventy of whom were Colored, chiefly, I
   believe, slaves.

   Mobile and Pensacola, about fifty miles apart, the former in Alabama
   and the latter in Florida, were supplied last year and this with the
   preaching of the gospel. Under the patronage of the Missionary Society,
   the Rev. Henry P. Cook was sent to these places. His deep piety and
   faithful exertions in the cause of Christ soon gave him a commanding
   and salutary influence among the people of his charge.

   Since Mobile has been connected with the United States, by the cession
   of Louisiana, it has filled up rapidly with inhabitants, has become an
   incorporated City, a port of entry, and a place of considerable trade;
   but, like most of the towns included in that tract of country, the
   people generally were quite neglectful of their spiritual and eternal
   interests until visited by the Methodist itinerants. Mr. Cook, however,
   was cordially received by a few, and he succeeded in raising a
   flourishing society, adopted measures for building a house of worship,
   which was finally completed, and the society has continued to flourish
   to the present time. Nor will the name of Henry P. Cook be soon
   forgotten by the inhabitants of Mobile. He fell a martyr to his work in
   that place this year, leaving behind him the savor of a good name, and
   numerous evidences of his deep devotion to his work, and of his love to
   the souls of men.

   Pensacola was also becoming a town of considerable importance in that
   part of Florida, and Mr. Cook was instrumental in raising a small
   society in that place, which, however, has fluctuated from time to
   time, struggling with various difficulties, until, in the year 1828,
   they succeeded in building a meeting-house, in which they assembled for
   the worship of God.

   While attending to these two places, as the principal scene of his
   labors, in passing from one to the other, Mr. Cook preached to some
   scattered inhabitants along the Escambia river, in West Florida, which
   was afterward occupied as a separate mission field.

   Tallahassee, in another part of Florida, was also provided with the
   means of grace this year. The Rev. John Slade was sent to this region
   of country as a missionary, and he succeeded in forming a society of
   seventy-three members, sixty whites and thirteen colored.

   The Early mission, in a neighboring region of country, was so
   successfully cultivated by the Rev. Morgan C. Turrentine, who was sent
   to form the circuit, that he returned no less than one hundred and
   thirty-six members, eighteen of whom were people of color. This year
   was the commencement of a work which has continued to spread in that
   part of Florida until several circuits have been formed, on which are
   large and flourishing societies. Such were the blessed results of the
   missionary spirit pervading our ranks at that time, and which has
   continued to rise and diffuse its hallowing influences in every
   direction among the people.

   In addition to those missions which included the more remote
   settlements in the exterior parts of our work, it was found, on
   examination, that there were many places in the older countries which
   had been overlooked by all denominations, being too remote from the
   center of population for the people to attend the stated places of
   worship. Such were the Highland and Hampshire missions, in the bounds
   of the New York conference; the former embracing a destitute population
   in the midst of the Highlands, a mountainous and rather poor region of
   country, about sixty miles north of the city of New York; the latter a
   district of country in the northwestern part of Massachusetts. The Rev.
   John J. Matthias was this year appointed to labor in the Highlands, and
   such was the success of his zealous efforts, that at the end of the
   first year he returned one hundred and thirty-four Church members, and
   at the termination of the second the people manifested a willingness
   and an ability to support themselves. It has accordingly since been
   included among the regular circuits.

   The Rev. Parmele Chamberlin was sent to the Hampshire mission. This was
   found a more difficult place to plant the tree of Methodism. Success,
   however, finally crowned the persevering efforts of God's servant, so
   that, at the end of four years, this was also taken into the regular
   work.

   While the work was thus extending itself in new places, and causing
   "the wilderness and solitary places to be glad for" the coming of these
   heralds of salvation, the older circuits and stations were blessed with
   the reviving influences of God's Spirit. Indeed, it was the vigorous
   action in the heart of the body which gave such a lively pulsation to
   the extremities. And what contributed not a little to diffuse this
   healthy action throughout the entire body was the publication of the
   Methodist Magazine, now arrived to the eighth volume, and which
   conveyed in its monthly numbers the news of what God was doing for the
   various tribes of men. Many testimonies to the salutary influence of
   this periodical on the interests of religion might be adduced from
   those preachers and others who were the most actively engaged in
   building up the walls of Zion. From the pages of the volume for this
   year, it appears evident that God was pouring out his Spirit on various
   parts of his vineyard, watering and reviving the souls of his people,
   and converting sinners from the error of their ways.

   A glorious work of God commenced in the latter part of last year in
   Chillicothe, Ohio, which resulted in an addition to the Church in that
   place, by the month of February of this year, of two hundred and
   twenty-eight members. From the time of the revival in this town in 1818
   and 1819, there had been a diminution in their number, owing chiefly to
   removals still farther west; but this gracious work not only made up
   their loss, but also added new strength to the society, and increased
   their numbers very considerably.

   Through the means of camp and quarterly meetings there was a great work
   of God on the Ontario district, then under the charge of the Rev.
   George Lane. This good work spread through all that region of country,
   so that the increase of members on that district for this year was
   upward of one thousand.

   The Genesee district was also visited with showers of divine grace, and
   most of the circuits shared in their refreshing influences.

   In Bridgetown, New Jersey, where religion had been languishing for some
   time, a gracious work of God commenced, which resulted in the
   conversion of about one hundred souls, most of whom became members of
   the Church.

   In Newark, New Jersey also, there was a manifest display of the grace
   of God in the awakening and conversion of souls, under the labors of
   the Rev. William Thacher. It began by urging upon believers the
   necessity of "going on unto perfection," or the seeking after holiness
   of heart and life; and no sooner did they feel the enlivening
   influences of the Holy Spirit in their own souls, than the work spread
   among the unawakened part of the community, and very soon fifty souls
   were added to the Church, and great seriousness rested on the
   congregation generally.

   On Coeyman's circuit, New York state, there was a general revival of
   the work of God. This also commenced among the professors of religion,
   who were induced to seek after "perfect love" as the privilege of
   believers in this life. Having their own souls baptized from on high,
   they were fired with a loving zeal for the salvation of their
   neighbors; and the consequence was, that one hundred and seventy were
   brought to the knowledge of the truth and added to the Church.

   In the city of Albany, where Methodism had struggled with many
   difficulties for a long time, God poured out his Spirit, and about
   fifty souls were brought into the fellowship of the Church.

   On the Champlain district, then under the charge of the Rev. Buel
   Goodsell, the work of God prevailed very generally among the circuits,
   and the hopes of God's people were greatly revived and their hearts
   strengthened. This good work was the result of a number of camp
   meetings which were held in different parts of the district. These were
   the means of the conversion of many sinners, and a general quickening
   among the professors of religion.

   New Haven district also, under the superintendence. of the Rev. Samuel
   Luckey, was favored with some revivals, and the state of religion was
   generally flourishing through the district.

   In this part of the country, as well as in some others, it had been
   found that we had labored to little purpose in the cities and principal
   villages, for want of convenient houses of worship, and because we had
   not a preacher constantly among the people. From these defects in our
   plans of procedure, our societies in New Haven, Middletown, and
   Hartford, and many other places, had been but feeble, and often the
   prospects were discouraging. About this time a remedy had been pro
   provided in some places, and was providing in others, by erecting
   churches, and stationing preachers in those cities and villages where
   the people were able to support them. The blessed effects of these
   movements were soon felt and seen, though in some instances, in
   building churches, the people felt themselves compelled, as they
   thought, to depart from our general usage, by selling or renting the
   slips, as they could not otherwise either build the houses, or induce
   the people to attend the preaching -- parents pleading that they wished
   to seat their children and members of their household with them in
   places of public worship.

   Whatever may be said against this policy in other parts of our work, it
   is certain that its adoption in many portions of the country in the
   eastern and northern states has had a beneficial influence upon the
   interests of our Church. By this means the people have been able to
   meet the expense of sustaining the worship of God, and also to secure
   permanent congregations; and the preachers could more fully and
   effectually discharge all the duties of pastors, in overseeing the
   temporal and spiritual affairs of the Church, such as visiting from
   house to house, attending upon the sick, burying the dead, meeting the
   classes, and regulating sabbath school, tract, and missionary
   societies. And who will say that these things are not as important to
   the well-being of the Church, or the prosperity of true religion, as it
   is "to preach so many sermons?"

   A great and glorious work this year prevailed in the Susquehannah
   district, in the bounds of the Genesee conference, under the presidency
   of the Rev. George Peck. Camp meetings were chiefly instrumental in
   kindling the sacred flame which spread among the circuits and stations
   of this region of country, and many sinners were happily converted to
   God, while the holy impulse was felt through the churches generally.

   The Rev. Dan Barnes, in giving an account of the Black river district,
   in the same conference, speaks of a great work which commenced at a
   camp meeting and thence spread in various directions.

   In the city of Baltimore the Rev. Samuel Merwin, who had charge of the
   church in that place this year, writes, that mighty works were wrought
   in the name of the Lord Jesus. He says that from fifty to one hundred
   and fifty were crying to God for mercy in the same meeting, and he
   presumed that from five hundred to six hundred were made partakers of
   pardoning mercy during the progress of the work.

   About this time a lively feeling was awakened in the Christian
   community in behalf of seamen, a class of men hitherto almost entirely
   neglected by the church. Indeed, as early as 1816, a few benevolent
   individuals in the city of New York had directed their attention to the
   condition of this useful class of men, and they succeeded in forming a
   society for promoting the gospel among seamen in the port of New York,
   consisting of nearly all evangelical denominations, and its operations
   are conducted on the most catholic principles. Its affairs are managed
   by a board of directors, holding a corporate seal by an act of the
   legislature. Being patronized by the Christian public, they succeeded,
   in 1819, in purchasing ground and erecting a house of worship in
   Roosevelt Street, near the quays on the East river, quite convenient
   for the sailors to attend. At the dedication of this house, in
   accordance with the catholic principles on which it was built, the
   three sermons were preached by a Protestant Episcopalian, a Dutch
   Reformed, and a Methodist Episcopal minister. To insure the stated
   ministry of the word, the Rev. Ward Stafford, a Presbyterian minister,
   was first engaged to take charge of the congregation, who was
   occasionally assisted by ministers of other denominations.

   After he left, the directors obtained a gratuitous supply by inviting
   ministers of various denominations, so as to keep up, as far as
   possible, the anti-sectarian character of the enterprise, that all
   might feel an interest in its promotion. It was soon found, however,
   that a congregation could not be collected and retained without the
   labors of a stated minister. Accordingly, in 1821, they employed the
   Rev. Henry Chase, at that time a local preacher, and an assistant
   teacher in the Wesleyan seminary in the city of New York, to take
   charge of a weekly prayer meeting in the church, to distribute tracts
   among seamen, to visit their families, and to perform such pastoral
   duties as might not interfere with his engagements with the seminary.
   Being quite successful in these efforts, at the request of the
   directors, and in accordance with the advice of his brethren in the
   ministry in the city of New York, Mr. Chase resigned his place as
   teacher in the Wesleyan seminary, and on the first of January, 1823,
   devoted himself entirely to the service of seamen.

   In 1825 brother Chase was admitted on trial in the New York conference,
   and, at the request of the directors of the seamen's society, was
   stationed in the Mariner's church, where, with the exception of
   eighteen months, when they had a minister of another denomination, he
   has continued ever since. In 1825, perceiving that great good resulted
   to seamen from his labors, and of those similarly employed in other
   places, and feeling the inconvenience of those changes which ordinarily
   take place in our Church, the General Conference made an exception in
   favor of those preachers who were laboring for the spiritual good of
   seamen, allowing the bishop to continue them in the same station for
   any length of time. Mr. Chase has accordingly been continued in the
   Mariner's church to the present time, as a member and elder in the New
   York conference, and his ministrations have been greatly blessed.
   Hundreds of seamen have been soundly converted to God, and the church
   is generally filled with orderly and attentive hearers every sabbath,
   and regular prayer meetings are held every week. There is, indeed, a
   great improvement in the condition and general conduct of this useful
   and suffering class of men.

   As the Mariner's church is supported by the several denominations of
   Christians, no church organization has taken place there, but those who
   were brought to the knowledge of the truth were at liberty to unite
   with whatever church they pleased; but I believe most of them have
   united with the Methodist Episcopal Church; and their numbers have
   become so considerable, that they have recently organized themselves
   into a church, under the name of the Methodist Episcopal Seamen's
   Church in the city of New York, have elected trustees, and are now
   (1840) making preparations to erect a house of worship for their
   accommodation and that of their seafaring brethren.

   Similar efforts have been made in other places, and with equal success,
   which will be noticed under their appropriate dates.

   On the whole, it would appear, notwithstanding some portions of our
   Church were agitated with discussions on the different modes of church
   government, that prosperity generally attended the labors of God's
   servants, and that the spirit of revival pervaded the ranks of our
   Israel. Some other churches also caught the flame in many places, and
   were therefore making delightful progress in the advancement of true
   religion.

   Fifty-eight preachers were located this year, fifty-five returned
   supernumerary, and eighty-three superannuated; fourteen had died, and
   three had been expelled.

   Among the dead was William Beauchamp, whose eminent talents fitted him
   for great usefulness in the church of God. And while the civil
   historian enriches his pages with memoirs of statesmen, poets, orators,
   philosophers, and men of military renown who have benefited their
   country, we may be allowed to preserve a record of those eminent
   ministers of the sanctuary who, by the depth and ardor of their piety,
   their genius, and their eloquence in the pulpit, have contributed to
   advance the best interests of their fellow-men. The characters of such
   men are a precious legacy which they have bequeathed to the Church,
   more valuable, indeed, than silver and gold.

   William Beauchamp was born in Kent county, Delaware state, on the 26th
   day of April, 1772. He was a descendant of a pious Methodist preacher,
   who, about the year 1785, removed to the west and settled on the
   Monongahela river, and from thence, in about eight years, on the Little
   Kenhawa river, Wood county, Va. Here, in conjunction with Mr. Rees
   Wolf; another Methodist preacher, he was instrumental in establishing
   some Methodist societies. William was a subject of religious
   impressions when quite a youth, and at about sixteen years of age he
   was made a partaker of justifying faith, and became a member of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church.

   In 1794 he joined the traveling ministry, and after discharging the
   duties of an itinerant preacher with great acceptance and usefulness
   west of the Allegheny mountains for three years, he was stationed, in
   1797, in the city of New York, and a few of the people here still
   remember the able manner in which he fulfilled the duties of his
   station. In 1799 he was stationed in Provincetown, in Massachusetts,
   and from thence he was removed, in 1800, to the island of Nantucket.

   In this place Methodism was scarcely known at that time. A local
   preacher by the name of Cannon had preached there with some success,
   and hence the conference was requested to send them a regular preacher,
   and Mr. Beauchamp was accordingly sent. Here his piety and talents soon
   gained him the confidence of the people, and he was instrumental in
   raising a society of eighty members, and before he left the place a
   large and commodious house of worship was erected. This laid the
   foundation of Methodism in the island of Nantucket, which has continued
   to enlarge its dimensions from time to time, so much so that the New
   England conference has held two of its sessions in that place, the
   first in 1820, and the second in 1836.

   Unhappily for the Church, whose interests he served, in 1801 Mr.
   Beauchamp located. In the same year he was united in matrimony to Mrs.
   Frances Russell, the widow of Mr. A. Russell, who had been lost at sea.

   Without stopping to notice the intervening periods of his life, it will
   be sufficient for the purposes of this short memoir to remark, that he
   remained in a located relation to the Church until 1822, when he
   re-entered the traveling connection, and continued therein until his
   death, which happened on the seventh day of October, 1824, in the
   fifty-third year of his age.

   His piety was unquestionable, and his talents as a minister of Jesus
   Christ, as a writer, and as a man of business, were of the first order;
   and, had he continued in the itinerant ministry, no doubt he would have
   arisen to the first distinction in the Church. During his located
   relation he removed to the west, and settled first in his former place
   of residence, on the Little Kenhawa, and then, in 1816, in Chillicothe,
   and finally he took up his residence at Mount Carmel, Illinois. Of this
   latter place, he, in conjunction with his friend, Thomas S. Hinde, was
   the founder. In all the places where he resided he obtained the
   confidence, respect, and affection of the people, and was eminently
   useful as a minister of Jesus Christ, as well as a citizen among his
   neighbors. Indeed, such is said to have been the confidence of his
   neighbors in his wisdom and integrity, that often civil suits were
   withdrawn from courts of justice and submitted to his arbitrament. He
   also infused into the minds of the youth within the circle of his
   acquaintance a taste for literary acquirements, both by example and
   precept.

   During this same period of his life he appeared before the public as a
   writer, and in 1811 he published an "Essay on the Truth of the
   Christian Religion," which is said, by those who are capable of judging
   of its character, to be a work of sterling merit. In 1816, while
   residing at Chillicothe, he became the editor of a monthly periodical,
   called "The Western Christian Monitor," for which he furnished some
   valuable pieces, written with spirit and much critical acumen. At this
   time we had no periodical publication; and feeling, in common with many
   others, the want of such a medium of instruction, he was led, aided by
   some of his literary friends in the west, to undertake this work. For
   the short time it existed its circulation was considerable, and its
   pages were enriched with articles, both original and selected, which
   did honor to the head and heart of its editor. Among others who
   contributed articles for the Western Christian Monitor was Thomas S.
   Hinde, better known under the signature of "Theophilus Arminius," whose
   sketches of western Methodism afterward enriched the pages of the
   Methodist Magazine, and who became the biographer of his deceased
   friend, the Rev. William Beauchamp. The work, however, continued in
   existence only one year, but it contained evidence of the piety,
   industry, and talent of its editor.

   After the commencement of the Methodist Magazine Mr. Beauchamp became
   an occasional contributor to that work, and all his pieces bear the
   stamp of genius, of an original thinker, and an accurate writer.

   Having returned to the ranks of the itinerancy, he again entered upon
   his work with all that ardor, and in the display of those ministerial
   qualifications, by which he had been before distinguished. In the
   second year he was appointed a presiding elder of the Indiana district.
   While traveling this district he was seized with a complaint with which
   he had before been visited, namely, an affection of the liver. He
   lingered under the influence of this corroding disease for about six
   weeks, during which time he exhibited the patience, faith, and love of
   the Christian, and died in the in hope of eternal life.

   Mr. Beauchamp was a close, a diligence, and a successful student,
   though in his youth he was deprived of the customary advantages of
   education. While a lad his father removed to the Monongahela, where
   schools were not to be found. But as he had contracted a taste for
   books before his removal, he surmounted the difficulties of his
   situation, procured torch-lights as a substitute for candles or lamps,
   and when the labors of the day were finished, and the family retired to
   rest, young Beauchamp would prostrate himself upon the floor, and
   examine his books by the light of his torch. In this way he treasured
   up a stock of useful information, of which he availed himself in after
   life. He became thoroughly acquainted with the principles of his
   vernacular language, studied the Latin and Greek, and in his riper
   years mastered the Hebrew tongue. In addition to these acquirements, he
   cultivated an acquaintance with some of the sciences, through the
   medium of the most accomplished authors. With this taste for literature
   and science, it seems strange that he should have neglected the study
   of history, as it is stated he did, this being of all others the most
   important to store the mind with useful knowledge, and especially for
   the minister of the gospel.

   These qualifications, superadded to the depth and uniformity of his
   piety, his love of the Bible, and his acquaintance with its doctrines
   and precepts, fitted him in an eminent degree for usefulness in the
   Church; and had he devoted himself exclusively to the work of the
   gospel ministry, as before said, he might have risen to one of its
   highest offices: as it was, after his return to the itinerancy, at the
   General Conference of 1824, which he attended as a delegate from the
   Missouri conference, he was a candidate for the episcopacy, and lacked
   only two votes more to insure his election.

   His style of preaching was remarkable for its chastity, plainness, and
   nervousness. No redundancy of words encumbered his sentences -- no
   pomposity of style swelled his periods nor did there appear any effort
   to produce a momentary effect for the empty purpose of gaining the
   shout of applause. His attitude in the pulpit was solemn, his gestures
   easy and graceful, his arguments sound and conclusive, and his
   positions were all fortified by apposite appeals to the sacred
   Scripture. And though he made no artificial efforts at oratorical
   display, yet he exhibited the true eloquence of a gospel minister, by
   making his language reflect clearly the perceptions of his mind, by
   pouring the truths of Christianity upon his audience in the purest
   strains of a neat and energetic diction, and by enforcing the whole by
   the sincerity and earnestness of his manner. His delivery was
   deliberate, not loud and boisterous, but clear and distinct, leaving an
   impression upon the mind of the hearer that truth and duty were the
   object of his pursuit.

   His biographer relates the following incident in proof of the power and
   conclusiveness of his arguments, when engaged in establishing a
   controverted point. His antagonist, who was listening attentively to
   the discourse, finding the arguments too powerful for him to answer,
   rose, apparently with an intention to leave the house, but was so
   overcome by the force of truth, and his whole frame so agitated, that,
   finding himself staggering, he caught hold of the railing, reeled, and
   dropped upon his seat, and there remained, overwhelmed and confounded,
   until the sermon was ended; he then silently withdrew, and left Mr.
   Beauchamp master of the field.

   But he rests from his labors. And whatever of human infirmities he may
   have exhibited, they were lost sight of amid the many excellences which
   adorned his character, and may therefore be entombed beneath the same
   turf which hides his mortal remains in Paoli, until the last trumpet
   shall awake his sleeping dust to life and immortality. Acknowledging
   himself indebted to divine grace for present peace and future
   salvation, he hung upon the promises of the gospel for support and
   comfort, and finally resigned up his soul to God in the full hope of
   eternal life.

   Another of the worthies who exchanged the itinerant race for the crown
   of reward was William Ross, of the New York conference. Though his race
   was comparatively short -- for he died in the thirty-third year of his
   age -- his course was steady, and his end glorious.

   He was a native of Tyringham, Mass., and was born February 10,1792. In
   the seventeenth year of his age he was made a partaker of the
   justifying grace of God, became a member of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, and, in his twentieth year, entered the ranks of the
   itinerancy. In the early periods of his ministry he labored chiefly in
   the state of Vermont, where, in consequence of the badness of the roads
   and coarseness of the fare, he sometimes suffered many privations,
   which gave him an opportunity of trying the strength of his
   resolutions, of his faith in Christ, his love to God and the souls of
   men. The faithfulness with which he discharged his duties in this
   rugged field of labor gave him favor in the eyes of the people, and
   commended him to the approbation of his brethren in the ministry.

   After traveling various circuits, in which he acquitted himself as an
   able minister of the New Testament, in 1821 he was stationed in the
   city of New York, where he labored two years with great acceptance. For
   the last two years of his ministry he was stationed in Brooklyn, Long
   Island, where he ended his life and labors in the full triumph of faith
   and hope. His last hours, indeed, were a brilliant comment upon the
   doctrines he had preached, and tended not a little to strengthen our
   faith in the divinity of their origin, and the efficacy of their
   application to the heart and conscience.

   William Ross is not exhibited as a great man, nor yet as a learned man.
   He was neither the one nor the other, in the common acceptation of
   these terms. But he was a good man, a good preacher, and a good
   husband, father, and friend, and he was thus good because the grace of
   God in Christ Jesus had made him such. In one sense, indeed, he was
   great. He had a clear perception of the plan of redemption by Christ
   Jesus, well understood the sacred Scriptures, was indefatigable in his
   labors, was an eloquent and successful preacher of righteousness, and
   exemplified in his own life those pure precepts of Christianity which
   he recommended to others.

   The high estimation in which he was held by his brethren, and by the
   Christian community generally, may be inferred from his being
   frequently called, in the course of his ministrations in New York and
   Brooklyn, to plead the cause of Bible, missionary, Sunday school, and
   tract societies. Here, indeed, he sometimes spoke with a force and
   eloquence which astonished and delighted his friends, while it
   confounded the enemies of these benevolent exertions for the salvation
   of the world.

   In the pulpit there was a peculiar solemnity in his manner, and dignity
   of expression -- the grave, distinct, sonorous intonations of his voice
   giving force and impressiveness to the sentiments he uttered, and
   reminded the hearer that be was listening to a messenger who felt the
   weight and importance of his message. Being a decided friend to all our
   benevolent institutions, and particularly to the missionary and
   education causes, he often advocated them in public, and gave them the
   weight of his influence in his more private intercourse in the circles
   in which he moved. Some of his satirical thrusts -- for he sometimes
   used this dangerous weapon to put error and folly to the blush -- at
   ignorance and covetousness, cut with the keener edge because of the
   strength and appropriateness with which they were sent by his skillful
   hand. Nor was he deterred from exposing these common pests of human
   society merely because the wounds which he inflicted upon their
   votaries made them writhe and groan under the sensations of pain which
   they frequently suffered.

   He was equally skillful and much more delighted in the pleasing task of
   portraying before his audience the glowing beauties of charity, the
   divine excellences of the other Christian graces, and the attractive
   charms with which Christianity invested him who clothed himself with
   its rich and lovely livery. When, therefore, William Ross "occupied
   that holy place, the pulpit," no one was disgusted with a repetition of
   cant and unmeaning -- unmeaning, I mean, to him who utters them --
   phrases, but he listened to the solemn realities of eternity, which
   fell from the speaker's lips in accents of deep feeling, in language at
   once chaste, plain, and intelligible, uttered in a tone of voice which
   bespoke a soul filled with the subject on which he was discoursing.

   I have made this short record as due to one who, had he lived and
   prospered in his race as lie began and ended it, would doubtless have
   ranked among the first ministers of our Church. There was, indeed, an
   amiability of disposition and courteousness, of demeanor about the
   movements of William Ross which drew forth the love of those who knew
   him, and at the same time a dignity of deportment which commanded their
   respect.

   There is one fact respecting him, which happened near the close of his
   life, that goes most forcibly to set off the beauty and strength of his
   character. When it was ascertained by the official members in the city
   of Brooklyn that he was to be stationed among them, some of them,
   perhaps the majority, remonstrated against the appointment, so strongly
   indeed that the bishop hesitated about insisting upon making it. Among
   others who may have been consulted, the writer's opinion was asked. The
   reply was, "Send him; for such is the weight of his character, the
   urbanity and meekness of his manners, as well as his talents as a
   preacher, that he will soon overcome all opposition, and prove himself
   worthy of the affection and confidence of the people;" and then added,
   "A people who will reject such a man as William Ross are unworthy of
   any preacher." This was said from an intimate acquaintance with the
   man, and likewise from a knowledge that the objections to him
   originated from a prejudice which had no foundation in truth and
   reality.

   He was sent. It was not three months before every objection against him
   was removed, the work of God prospered, the church was filled with
   hearers, and never was a man more highly esteemed or affectionately
   loved than brother Ross was by the people of Brooklyn. So highly did
   they estimate his labors among them, that, immediately after his death,
   the society contributed about twelve hundred dollars for the support of
   his widow and orphan children.

   Of the other twelve who had ended their labors during the past year,
   honorable mention is made of their fidelity in the cause of God and of
   their peaceful death.

  1826

   The aboriginal missions which had been commenced and prosecuted under
   such favorable auspices continued to prosper, and to promise the most
   happy results. There was, however, no other aboriginal mission opened
   this year, and nothing worthy of special notice which happened among
   those which had been begun, except that their continued prosperity
   still attracted the attention of the Church, and led to those plans for
   the evangelization of other tribes which will be noticed hereafter.

   The great change which had been wrought among the Mississauga Indians,
   heretofore related, was followed by the most blessed results on other
   fragments of the same tribe. An additional number of twenty-two, who
   professed faith in Christ, were baptized this year and formed into a
   class in Bellville, in Upper Canada. They were placed under the care of
   two of their principal men, Captain William Beaver and John Sunday, who
   had before given evidence of a sound conversion, and who now acted as
   class leaders. Nothing could furnish a more convincing evidence of the
   thorough change which had been effected in the hearts of these people,
   than was evinced by their forsaking entirely their the heathenish
   habits, and banishing from among them the use of all intoxicating
   liquors, becoming thereby sober and industrious. Infidelity itself was
   constrained to bow before the majesty of truth, and to confess, however
   reluctantly, that nothing short of divine power could produce a
   reformation so thorough and permanent.

   Some new missions were commenced this year, embracing parts of Florida
   and Alabama, called the Holme's Valley and Pea river missions, and were
   put under the charge of the presiding elder of the Tallahassee
   district, the Rev. George Evans. These countries were but thinly
   populated, the settlements sometimes being from twenty to forty miles
   distant from each other, separated by a wilderness. On this account it
   was difficult to collect congregations, or to pass from one settlement
   to another; but, notwithstanding these discouraging circumstances, the
   missionaries succeeded in their evangelical efforts in forming
   societies, so that, in 1827, there were returned on the Holme's Valley
   mission one hundred and two white and thirty-five colored members, and
   on Pea river one hundred and four white and twenty-one colored; and the
   good work thus begun has steadily gone forward from that time to this,
   so that Tallahassee has since become the seat of the Alabama
   conference.

   The Rev. S. Belton was sent to form a circuit in the newly settled
   townships between the Mississepa [sic] and Attawa rivers, in Upper
   Canada, places which had been seldom if ever visited by any minister of
   the gospel. The settlements had been formed chiefly by emigrants from
   Ireland, who were in very moderate circumstances, and therefore unable
   to do much for the support of religious institutions. They were,
   however, thankful for the care thus manifested for their spiritual
   welfare, generally listened with attention to the word of life, and did
   what they could to make the missionary comfortable. That the word took
   effect is manifest from the fact that the next year there were returned
   on the Minutes two hundred and seven members, and the work has
   continued to prosper, under the labors of God's servants, from that to
   the present time.

   There were several refreshing revivals of religion this year in some of
   the older circuits, more particularly in the south and west, where the
   principal increase of members was found. These revivals were
   accompanied by the same evidence of divine power and grace which had
   attended those heretofore related, and gave to the friends of religion
   irrefutable arguments in their favor. At a camp meeting held on Hanover
   circuit, in Virginia, there were not less than one hundred and twenty
   souls who professed to find the pearl of great price, and the good work
   spread with such rapidity that upward of three hundred were brought to
   God on this circuit. On the Bottetourt circuit similar results followed
   two camp meetings which were held there this year. In Anne Arundel
   county, Maryland, there were mighty displays of the power of God. The
   work commenced at a camp meeting held at a place called Rattlesnake
   Springs. It was believed that not less than two hundred and fifty
   persons were brought from darkness to light, and several professed to
   be filled with "perfect love," while many departed from the place under
   deep conviction for sin, and groaning for redemption in the blood of
   the Lamb.

   Though these and other instances of revival were witnessed during the
   year, yet the general increase of Church members was not so great as
   the year before.

   The New England conference had succeeded in establishing an academy
   within its bounds, for the education of youth of both sexes, in
   Wilbraham, Massachusetts, and the one at Newmarket was merged in this.
   It was this year put under the charge of the Rev. Wilbur Fisk, by whose
   pious and judicious management it greatly prospered, and was soon
   filled with students, and has been instrumental in shedding the lights
   of literature and religion on the rising generation. Here young
   gentlemen are taught all those branches of literature preparatory to an
   entrance into college, or upon the active business of life, at the same
   time that the principles of the gospel are faithfully inculcated; and
   the institution has been frequently favored with gracious outpourings
   of the Spirit, resulting in the conversion of many of the students.

   The Pittsburgh conference made an attempt to establish a collegiate
   institution within its bounds, called Madison College, and the Rev.
   Henry B. Bascom was appointed its president. It was located in
   Uniontown, Fayette county, in the state of Pennsylvania. It went into
   operation under favorable auspices, and was incorporated, in 1827, by
   the legislature of the state. It did not, however, long continue. Its
   endowment was small, and the number of students was by no means
   adequate to its support. Hence, though blessed with an able faculty,
   its dissolution affords another evidence of the impracticability of
   sustaining collegiate institutions without ample endowments. How else
   can this be done? The price of tuition is necessarily so low, in the
   various literary institutions in our country, that an attempt to raise
   it sufficiently high to meet the expense of tuition and other
   incidental expenses would be to debar all students from an entrance
   into their inclosures; and it is equally impossible to sustain them
   from the ordinary prices of tuition and board; and hence the absolute
   necessity of ample endowments, either from the state, or from the
   benefactions of individuals, or by the more sure method of annual
   collections, in order to keep them in successful operation. Of this all
   must be sensible, and therefore all who feel an interest in the
   prosperity of these institutions must, if they would have them
   permanently established, contribute liberally for their support.

   In the month of September this year was commenced the publication of
   the Christian Advocate, a weekly periodical, devoted especially to the
   interests of the Methodist Episcopal Church and to general
   intelligence. Periodical literature had become more and more in demand
   since the recommencement of the Methodist Magazine, and weekly
   religious newspapers were springing into existence among almost all
   denominations of Christians; and two, one in Boston, Mass., and another
   in Charleston, S. C., were published under the patronage of their
   respective conferences, and the friends of the Church very generally
   seemed to call for one to be issued from the Book Room. This led to a
   consultation among the editors and book committee, together with some
   of the annual conferences; the proposition was finally submitted to the
   New York conference, at its session in May of this year, and it
   recommended that measures be adopted for the publication of such a
   periodical with all convenient speed.

   It is true, some were opposed to the measure, particularly those who
   were interested in the success of the papers already in existence,
   which had now obtained an extensive circulation, particularly Zion's
   Herald, the one issued in Boston. This opposition, however, was
   overruled, and the first number of the Christian Advocate was published
   on the 9th of September, 1826.

   The appearance of this weekly sheet, filled, as it was, with useful and
   interesting matter, gave great satisfaction to the members and friends
   of our Church, and the number of subscribers in a very short time
   amounted to about thirty thousand. That it has done much good, and was
   most opportunely commenced, has been abundantly demonstrated in every
   successive year of its circulation, and by the testimony of thousands
   of its readers. By this means intelligence is received from every part
   of the world, and conveyed, weekly, as from a common center of
   information, to its thousands of readers in every comer of the land.
   Thus old friends, who may be separated at a distance of thousands of
   miles, may hear from each other, interchange sentiments, and, in some
   sense, converse together of each other's welfare; and what the Lord is
   doing in one part of his vineyard may be known in every other part.
   This is the advantage which a general possesses over a local paper.
   This was extensively felt and appreciated, and hence its circulation,
   in the course of one year from its commencement, by far exceeded every
   other paper, religious or secular, published in the United States.

   Sixty-three preachers located this year, sixty-six were returned
   supernumerary, eighty-six superannuated, two withdrew, and six were
   expelled; twenty had died.

   Among the deaths recorded this year was that of John Summerfield, whose
   eminent talents as a preacher gave him a commanding attitude before the
   community, and excited a general tone of regret when the news of his
   death was announced. For a full account of his life and labors I must
   refer the reader to his biography, which was published by his
   brother-in-law soon after his death. From this it appears that he was
   born in the town of Preston, in England, on the 31st of January, 1795.
   His father was a local preacher in the Wesleyan Methodist connection in
   England, and he educated his son John in those religious principles
   which governed his own heart and life. At a suitable age he was put
   under the tuition of the Moravian academy at Fairfield, near
   Manchester, where he gave early indications of that precocious genius
   for which he was afterward so eminently distinguished.

   In 1813 the family removed to Ireland, where, at the age of seventeen,
   young Summerfield was made a partaker of justifying grace through faith
   in Jesus Christ while attending a prayer meeting with some pious
   Methodist soldiers. He no sooner tasted that the Lord is gracious than
   he felt a desire that others should participate with him in the same
   inestimable blessing. He accordingly embraced every opportunity to
   invite his fellow-sinners to come to the fountain of salvation, that
   they might drink of its waters and live for ever. In this way he
   continued to exercise his gifts, greatly to the satisfaction of those
   who heard him, until 1819, when he was received on trial in the
   Methodist conference of Ireland. As it was a time of some trouble among
   the Methodist societies in Ireland in those days, and as the fervor of
   his spirit and powers of pulpit oratory gave him more than ordinary
   influence, young as he was, he was selected to travel extensively
   through the country, for the purpose of promoting the general interests
   of the societies. He continued to travel and preach in Ireland, making,
   in the mean time, an occasional visit to England, until 1821, when his
   father removed to America, and John accompanied him, and was received
   on trial in the New York conference in the spring of 1821. [20]

   His first appearance in public after his arrival in New York was at the
   anniversary of the American Bible Society, and his speech on that
   occasion was received with great elation, and gave him a most favorable
   introduction to the American community. Nor were his labors in the
   pulpit unappreciated. The houses were thronged with hearers whenever he
   preached, and the auditors hung upon his lips with the most intense
   interest and delight. Persons of all professions and of all classes of
   society were attracted by the fame of his eloquence, and expressed
   their admiration of the power with which he enchained them to the words
   which dropped from his lips.

   Many have inquired in what the secret of this power over the
   understandings and attention of the multitude consisted. In whatever
   else it might have consisted, it was not in empty declamations, in
   boisterous harangues, nor yet in any attempt to overpower and astonish
   you with sudden bursts of eloquence; nor was it, I apprehend, in the
   unusual depth. and profoundness of his researches.

   Summerfield was young, was pious, honest, and simple-hearted, was
   naturally eloquent, deeply devoted to the cause of God, possessed a
   great command of language, and his style of preaching was chaste and
   classical, flowing from him with an easy and graceful elocution. This I
   believe to be the secret of his power. He had a sound understanding, a
   warm heart, and a vivid imagination -- had acquired a rich stock of the
   most useful knowledge and hence, whenever he spoke in the name of God,
   he poured forth from a heart overflowing with the kindliest feelings a
   stream of evangelical truth, which fell upon the audience "like dew
   upon the under herb, and like rain upon the mown grass." A "godly
   sincerity" was evidently the pervading principle of his heart, and a
   tone of simplicity characterized his style of preaching. When you heard
   him you were charmed with the melody of his voice, with the rich flow
   of his language, with the pure and evangelical sentiments which he
   uttered, and with the deep spirit of piety running through his whole
   performance. No strained efforts to dazzle you with wit, or with
   high-sounding words, with pompous periods, with far-fetched metaphors,
   or with sentences swelled and encumbered with an accumulation of
   epithets, appeared in any of his discourses or speeches. On the
   contrary, you felt that you were listening to a messenger of God,
   honestly proclaiming what he believed to be the truth, in language
   chaste and elegant, flowing from a heart filled with his subject,
   breathing good-will to his audience, and intent only on doing them
   good. This was John Summerfield in the pulpit; and his popularity arose
   from an active zeal, exemplified in his spirit and words, to promote
   the best interests of all classes of men by the wisest possible means.

   Nor was his society in the more private circles less attractive and
   instructive. On his first appearance among us there was a modesty and
   diffidence, a meekness and humility, every way becoming a Christian and
   a young minister who felt a proper deference for his seniors. To say
   that he did not, in some measure at least, rise in self-confidence with
   the rising popularity of his character, would be saying what no one
   acquainted with human nature could well believe. But the elevation of
   his character, as a preacher of the gospel, gave him a commanding
   attitude before the community, which he constantly exerted to promote
   the highest interests of his fellow-men. He certainly bore his honors
   with becoming modesty, and availed himself of his great popularity to
   advance the honor of God and the salvation of men. Though the minister
   of a sect, and thoroughly imbued with its doctrine and spirit, he was
   far from being exclusive in his feelings and views, hut displayed that
   spirit of Catholicism which enabled him to exert a hallowing influence
   on all around him. And while he must have carried about him the common
   infirmities of our nature, they were but as occasional spots upon the
   sun they obscured his luster but, for a moment, and then his
   intellectual, moral, and religious excellences shone out with an
   increasing and a steady brilliancy:

   He most certainly exerted a beneficial influence upon the interests of
   true religion. Nor was this influence confined to his own Church. Other
   denominations, and particularly the various charitable and religious
   associations, availed themselves of his talents to advocate their cause
   and to promote their respective objects. And as he was ever ready to
   comply with their wishes, as before said, his physical powers were not
   adequate to the task of such continued application. The fire which
   burned within became so intense that the material vessel was gradually
   weakened by its consuming flames. He was at first prostrated by a
   hemorrhage of the lungs, from which, however, he partially recovered,
   so as to be able to appear occasionally in public. But his appearance
   was extremely wan and feeble, while his soul still broke forth in those
   strains of gospel truth and persuasive eloquence which captivated his
   hearers and melted them into tenderness.

   It was hoped by his friends that a voyage to Europe might tend to
   reinvigorate his enfeebled constitution. He accordingly made a voyage
   to France, and attended the anniversary of the Paris Bible Society as a
   representative of the American Bible Society, where he delivered one of
   those addresses for which he was so peculiarly qualified, as the
   zealous and able advocate of institutions of benevolence. This address,
   which was interpreted by Mr. Wilder, an American gentleman, and a
   benevolent Christian, then residing in Paris, was received with
   enthusiastic admiration by the audience, and responded to in terms of
   affectionate respect and congratulation, expressive of the joy that was
   felt in the union of sentiment and effort which mutually pervaded and
   actuated the Paris and American Bible Societies.

   On his return from his foreign tour he entertained hopes, for a season,
   that his health might be restored; but these hopes were soon blasted by
   the return of his disease, accompanied by those symptoms which gave
   sure indications to his physicians and friends that his dissolution was
   nigh at hand. After lingering for a considerable time, frequently
   suffering exquisitely from the violence of his disorder, he at last
   glided sweetly and peacefully into eternity, in the twenty-eighth year
   of his age, and the eighth of his public ministry.

   During his protracted illness he exhibited the virtues of meekness and
   patience in an eminent degree, bowing submissively to the divine
   mandate, and looking forward with a lively hope to immortality and
   eternal life. Though sometimes he complained of the want of spiritual
   consolation, and of a feeling of mental gloom which arose, no doubt,
   from the nature of his disease yet for most of the time he manifested
   an unshaken confidence in his God, and expressed a calm resignation to
   his will, mingled with a hope full of immortality. But he rests from
   his labors, and his works of faith and labors of love have followed him
   as evidences of his fidelity to the cause of God.

   Another who fell in the harness this year was an old veteran of the
   cross of Christ, whose long services and deep devotion to the cause of
   God deserve commemoration.

   Daniel Asbury had been in the ministry forty years, during which time
   he had given evidence of his warm attachment to the holy cause he had
   espoused, by the fidelity with which he had discharged his Christian
   and ministerial duties. He was not, indeed, a great preacher, but he
   was remarkably distinguished for the meekness of his disposition, for
   his patience in suffering, and for the simplicity of his manners. He
   therefore won the confidence of his brethren as a man of God, and a
   most devoted minister of Jesus Christ.

   His death was sudden and peaceful. Returning from a walk in the yard,
   he looked up toward heaven, with a smile on his countenance, and
   uttering a few words, he sunk into the arms of death, in the
   sixty-fifth year of his age.

   Daniel Hitt had also departed to another world in the full hope of
   eternal life. He was made a partaker of the grace of pardon in early
   life, and in 1790 entered the itinerant ministry. In the first years of
   his itinerancy he labored much in the new settlements in Virginia and
   in the western country, where he won for himself those laurels which
   adorn the brow of the faithful, self-denying minister of Jesus Christ.
   For several years he was the traveling companion of Bishop Asbury, who
   ever treated him as his confidential friend. During these travels over
   the continent he became extensively known to a large circle of friends,
   who esteemed him highly as a brother, and as an amiable Christian
   minister.

   In 1808 he was elected as an assistant book agent, in which office he
   served for four years, under the supervision of the Rev. John Wilson.
   At the end of this term he was elected the principal, in which office
   he continued to discharge its duties, according to the best of his
   ability, to the end of his constitutional term, in 1816. Though his
   literary attainments were limited, yet his strict integrity and great
   fidelity eminently fitted him for a faithful discharge of his duties in
   the high trust confided to him. And the affability of his manners, the
   sweetness of his disposition, and his courteous conduct in the social
   circle, endeared him to his friends, as a companion in whose society
   they delighted to mingle.

   In the pulpit he dwelt chiefly upon experimental and practical
   religion, seldom entering upon those controverted points which so often
   involve discussions among the several denominations of Christians. Here
   he was solemn and dignified, and strove to impress upon the minds of
   all the importance of a practical attention to the truths which he
   uttered.

   He died of the typhus fever. In his sickness his mind was kept in
   peace, and he died in the triumph of faith and love.

   Another aged veteran, Joseph Toy, was taken from the walls of our
   Jerusalem to his resting place above. He was brought from darkness to
   light under the preaching of Captain Webb, who was one of the first
   Methodist preachers in America, and was at that time preaching in
   Burlington, New Jersey. This was in the year 1770, and Joseph was then
   in the twenty-second year of his age. After receiving license to
   preach, he labored as a local preacher until 1801, when he entered the
   itinerancy, in which he continued, faithfully discharging its duties,
   to the end of his life.

   In 1819, in consequence of debility, he was returned superannuated, and
   he settled in the city of Baltimore, where he preached occasionally,
   and was beloved and respected by all who knew him. Having filled up the
   measure of his days in obedience to the will of God, he died in great
   peace, on the 28th day of January, 1826, in the seventy-ninth year of
   his age.

   One of the excellences of brother Toy was the punctuality with which he
   filled his engagements. At the age of seventy he was heard to say that
   for twenty years he had not disappointed a congregation -- a practice
   worthy of the imitation of all. Although, in the latter part of his
   life, his sight so failed him that it was difficult for him to walk the
   streets without help, yet he continued to preach almost every sabbath,
   and sometimes twice, and was finally conducted from the pulpit to his
   dying bed, on which he manifested a perfect submission to the divine
   will, expressing his firm reliance upon the promise of eternal life.

   John P. Finley, professor of languages in the Augusta College,
   Kentucky, had entered into rest during the past year. Though he was
   young in the itinerant ministry, yet he was a man of distinguished
   worth, and possessed virtues which may be profitably held up or the
   imitation of others. The following account is from the pen of Dr.
   Bascom, whose intimate knowledge of the subject of his remarks enabled
   him to depict the character of brother Finley as it was, and especially
   to present those peculiarities by which he was distinguished: --

   "John P. Finley was born in North Carolina, June 13th, 1783. From
   childhood he was marked as possessing no common share of intellect. He
   was early placed at school, and while in his abecedarian [beginning --
   DVM] course he evinced an aptitude to learn that induced his father, a
   distinguished Presbyterian clergyman, (who is now, at the age of
   seventy, a Methodist traveling preacher,) to give him a classical
   education. Owing to his habits of industry and perseverance, he soon
   acquired a competent knowledge of the sciences, and a reputable
   acquaintance with the learned languages. Of the English language he was
   a perfect master, and taught its proper use with almost unrivaled
   success. From the age of twelve or fourteen years he was often deeply
   affected with a sense of sin, and the importance of repentance and
   faith; but his mind was so much perplexed with the doctrines of
   absolute personal predestination, of which his father was then a
   strenuous and able assertor, that he came to no decision on the subject
   of religious opinions until he reached the years of manhood. About the
   age of twenty-one he married, and soon after was brought to the
   knowledge of salvation by the remission of his sins. Early after his
   conversion he was convinced that a dispensation of the gospel' had been
   committed to him. He weighed well the impressions and convictions of
   his mind and heart in relation to the fearful and responsible business
   of a Christian minister; but, when finally and fully convinced of his
   duty, he did not hesitate. There were, indeed, many reasons why he
   should confer with flesh and blood, but with his characteristic
   firmness he rejected them all, and took the pulpit, I think, in 1811.
   At the time of his conversion he resided in Highland county, Ohio. His
   ministerial career was commenced during a residence in Union, Greene
   county, Ohio, whither he had been called to take charge of a seminary.
   At the head of this institution he continued about six years, living
   and preaching the religion of Christ in its native simplicity and
   power.

   "From Union he removed to Dayton, distant only about thirty miles, and
   conducted an academy in this place for two years. It was here our
   acquaintance and intimacy commenced, which ended only with his useful
   life. He left Dayton, beloved and regretted of all, and accepted a call
   to superintend a respectable seminary in Steubenville, Ohio. In this
   place he continued not quite two years. In his ministerial exertions he
   was instant in season and out of season,' and labored with more than
   ordinary success. His next remove was to Piqua, Ohio, where he
   continued as principal of an academy for four years. In all these
   places his pulpit efforts were highly acceptable; his social
   intercourse seasoned with dignity and piety, and his residence a
   blessing to all about him. From this place he made his last remove to
   Augusta, Kentucky. Here he taught a classical school for some time, and
   was afterward appointed principal of Augusta College, in which
   relation. he continued until the time of his death. In these several
   places his labors in the pulpit were considerable and extensively
   useful. All who knew him esteemed him as a man of talents and
   irreproachable Christian character. He was indeed, all in all, one of
   the most amiable, guileless men I ever knew: never did I know a man
   more perfectly under the influence of moral and religious principle.
   His uniform course was one of high and unbending rectitude. One error,
   as reported in the Minutes,' respecting his conversion, I must beg
   leave to correct. I do it upon his own authority (when living) and that
   of his brother, the Rev. James B. Finley, superintendent of the Wyandot
   mission . There is something rather remarkable in the manner in which
   these worthy ministers were first brought to reflect with more than
   ordinary concern upon their latter end. John and James were amusing
   themselves in the forest with their guns; and as John was sitting
   carelessly upon his horse, James's gun accidentally went off, and the
   contents came very near entering John's head. The brothers were
   mutually alarmed, humbled, and thankful; they were more than ever
   struck with the melancholy truth, that in the midst of life we are in
   death;' they reflected upon their unpreparedness to meet death and
   appear in judgment. Each promised the other he would reform; and the
   result was, they were both led to seek religion, as the only
   preparation for eternity. Both the brothers agree in stating that this
   circumstance was the means, in the hand of God, of their awakening and
   conversion, as neither of them was in the habit of attending the
   preaching of the gospel before the inquietude and alarm created by this
   occasion. I have been thus minute in detailing the immediate means of
   his conversion, at the request of a surviving brother, in whose
   estimation the apparent incompetency of the means magnifies the grace
   of God in this singular dispensation of blended mercy and providence.

   "John P. Finley was in the ministry about fifteen years. He was
   ordained deacon by Bishop Asbury, on the 17th of September, 1815. He
   received ordination as elder at the hands of Bishop Roberts, July 2,
   1820. At the time of his death he was a member of the Kentucky annual
   conference -- actively dividing his time and energies between the
   business of collegiate instruction and the labor of the pulpit.

   "As a man, the subject of these recollections was engagingly amiable,
   ingenuous, and agreeable; equally removed from affectation and reserve,
   the circle in which he moved felt the presence of a friend and the
   influence of a Christian and minister.

   "As a teacher his excellence was acknowledged by all who were competent
   to decide upon his claims; and though he gloried most in being found a
   pupil in the school of Christ, yet he was no stranger to the academy
   and lyceum.

   "As a husband, there is one living whose tears have been his eulogy,
   and to whom, with his orphan children, friendship inscribes these
   lines. As a father, he was worthy of his children, and in pointing them
   to another and better world he was always careful to leave the way
   himself.

   "As a friend, he was warm, ardent, and confiding, and not less generous
   than constant; his intimate friends, however, were few and well
   selected.

   "As a minister, in the pulpit, he was able, impressive, and
   overwhelming. The cross of his redemption was his theme, and in life
   and death it became to him the emphasis of every joy.' In all these
   relations knew him well, and can therefore speak from the confidence of
   personal knowledge and accredited information.

   "The last time I saw him I preached a sermon, at his request, on the
   Inspiration of the Scriptures.' When I had retired to my room, he
   called on me, in company with a friend, and in his usual frank manner
   embraced me, and observed, H____, I thank you for that sermon, and I
   expect to repeat my gratitude in heaven.' Little did I think, at this
   interview, I was gazing on my friend for the last time, and that in
   eighteen months his ripened virtues were to receive the rewards of the
   heavenly world! But so it was, and I, less fit to die, am spared
   another and another year.

   "He died on the 8th of May, 1825, in the forty-second year of his age
   and sixteenth of his ministry; and at the same time that his bereaved
   family wept upon his grave, the sadness of the Church told that she had
   lost one of her brightest ornaments. Just before his triumphant spirit
   rose to sink and sigh no more, he was asked how he felt, and what were
   his prospects upon entering the dark valley and shadow of death. He
   replied, in language worthy of immortality, Not the shadow of a doubt;
   I have Christ within, the hope of glory -- that comprehends all;' and
   then, with the proto-martyr, he fell asleep.'

   "Such is a very imperfect sketch of the life, character, and death of
   John P. Finley. God grant, reader, that you and I may share the glory
   that gilded the last hours of his toil."

   White, Henry P. Cook, Christopher Mooring, David Stevens, Sylvester G.
   Hill, Ezekiel Canfield, William S. Pease, Samuel G. Atkins, and Damon

   that they all finished their course with joy.

  1827

   This year the "Sunday School Union of the Methodist Episcopal Church"
   was formed in the city of New York. The reader, however, is not to
   infer from this that the Methodists now for the first time entered upon
   the work of Sunday school instruction. In the first volume of this
   History we have seen that sabbath schools were commenced among the
   Methodists in this country as early as 1790, but were soon discontinued
   for want of sufficient encouragement. The origin of these schools in
   England is well known; and Mr. Wesley was among the first to patronize
   and recommend them to his people, and they soon became very general
   throughout his societies.

   It was about the year 1816 that the several denominations of
   evangelical Christians in this country began to turn their attention to
   Sunday school instruction, and the plan of a union was formed for the
   purpose of harmonizing their views and concentrating their efforts,
   under an impression that by these means more good might be effected to
   the rising generation than by separate and denominational action. This
   resulted in the formation of the "American Sunday School Union," which
   was located in the city of Philadelphia, and extended itself, by means
   of auxiliaries, all over the United States, embracing all evangelical
   denominations, or so many of each as chose to unite with them. Into
   this union our people had in some places entered. By the parent society
   books were issued, agents employed to travel through the country to
   promote its objects, and a weekly periodical commenced, devoted
   especially to the interests of sabbath schools.

   With this general union, however, all were not satisfied. Most of the
   Protestant Episcopalians chose to conduct their schools independently
   of the American Union, and many of the Methodists were uneasy under
   this regulation; and, after much consultation, it was finally agreed to
   form a Sunday school society of our own, under such regulations as
   should be conformable to our doctrinal and other peculiarities. The
   reasons for this measure I cannot express better than in the following
   address, which was sent out by the managers immediately after the
   formation of the society. It fully unfolds the motives and objects by
   which its founders were actuated. It is as follows: --

   "In approaching you on the subject to which your attention is now
   invited, the managers take the liberty of stating a few things which
   have dictated the propriety of forming the society designated by the
   above constitution. They can assure you that they have not been led
   hastily into this measure, but, according to their best ability, have
   Carefully weighed every circumstance connected with it, having
   deliberately consulted with each other, and with their most aged and
   experienced brethren, both preachers and private members of the Church.

   "The Methodist Episcopal Church is now composed of nearly four hundred
   thousand members, upward of fourteen hundred traveling preachers, and
   perhaps more than double that number of local preachers. From the
   peculiar organization of this Church, all these are considered as one
   body, adopting the same doctrines, discipline, mode of church
   government, and, the managers would hope, actuated by the same spirit,
   under the same great Head of the church, striving to preserve the unity
   of the Spirit in the bonds of peace.' These, together with the regular
   attendants on the Methodist ministry, make a population, including
   children, of not less than two millions, which are dependent on the
   ministrations of our Church.

   "Without even insinuating the want of soundness in the cardinal
   principles of Christianity, in the major part of other Christian
   denominations in our country, calling in question the purity of their
   motives or ardency of their zeal, the managers will not conceal the
   fact, that they give a decided preference to their own Church, firmly
   believing its doctrines and discipline, and have witnessed with
   unspeakable joy its surprising progress in so short a time, and its
   salutary influence on the hearts and lives of so many happy thousands.
   It is a truth as evident as the blaze of the sun at mid-day, that the
   first impetus which was given to the great work of reformation now
   going forward in the world, God gave through the instrumentality of the
   Wesleys and their coadjutors in the ministry of reconciliation.' The
   introduction into this country of a spiritual and energetic itinerating
   ministry, first begun' by those men of God, has produced results at
   once astonishing and delightful. Others have caught the missionary
   Spirit, and have entered into the work with zeal and success. In
   spreading pure religion, the managers wish them all good speed.

   "Among other effects of this great work, by which the present age is
   distinguished, sabbath school instruction is not the least. The primary
   object of the first promoters of this work was to afford elementary
   instruction to such poor children as were destitute of common day
   school education, and at the same time to give such religions
   instruction as is suited to the age and capacity of the children. The
   utility of this mode of imparting knowledge to the juvenile mind soon
   became apparent to all denominations of Christians, and in the large
   towns and cities especially they have less or more availed themselves
   of its advantages. In the progress of the work, in our country, efforts
   have been made to unite all sects and parties in one general society,
   called The American Sunday School Union Society;' and while many have
   come into this union, others, thinking it best to manage their own
   affairs in their own way, remain in all insulated state, or have
   arrayed themselves under the standard of their own denomination.

   "Among others who have hitherto stood alone, there are many belonging
   to our Church. Not feeling inclined to connect themselves with the
   general union, and finding no center of union in their own Church, they
   have long felt the inconvenience of their insulated state. As the
   Methodist Book Concern is located in the city of New York, it was
   natural for them to look to this place for aid. Accordingly, frequent
   applications have been made to the agents of that establishment in
   reference to this subject. It was at once perceived that this
   establishment afforded facilities for printing and circulating books
   suitable for Sunday schools, as well as the receiving and sending out,
   through the medium of the periodical works printed there, all necessary
   information in relation to their institution which could not be
   obtained elsewhere; and the agents of that Concern have pledged
   themselves to the society that Sunday school books shall be furnished
   by them as cheap as they can be obtained at any other place.

   "These circumstances led to the idea of forming a Sunday School Union
   for the Methodist Episcopal Church. But here, at the outset, many
   difficulties were to be encountered. Most of those in our Church
   engaged in Sunday schools in the city of New York were connected with
   the general union; and though some things had recently transpired of
   which they could not wholly approve, they were strongly attached to the
   union, having labored in this work with their brethren of other
   denominations with much harmony and Christian feeling; but, after
   deliberating with calmness on all the circumstances of the case, the
   managers are convinced that duty enjoins it on them, because more good
   may be ultimately accomplished, to form a union for the Church of which
   they are members, independent of the American Union. Experiment alone
   will test the correctness of this opinion.

   "It has already been observed, that the primary object of Sunday
   schools was to impart elementary instruction, mixed with religious
   improvement, to those children who were destitute of the advantages
   derived from common schools. Though this original object ought never to
   be abandoned, yet the general diffusion of this sort of instruction in
   our country, through the medium of common schools, and public and
   private free schools, renders this object less essential. Hence
   religious instruction is the grand and primary object of Sunday school
   instruction in our day and among our children. On this account, how,
   ever humiliating the fact, a general union of all parties becomes the
   more difficult. Whatever may be the intention, each teacher of religion
   will more or less inculcate his own peculiar views of Christianity, and
   thus insensibly create party feelings and interests. And this
   difficulty is increased by the practice recently adopted by the
   employment of missionaries who are to be supported from the funds of
   the general institution. The managers are of the opinion, that the most
   likely way for the several denominations to live and labor together in
   peace, is for each to conduct its own affairs, and still to hold out
   the hand of fellowship to its neighbor. They therefore disclaim all
   unfriendly feeling toward others who may be engaged in this good work.
   They wish them all success in diffusing moral and religious influence
   on the minds of youth, and hope always to be ready to reciprocate any
   at of kindness which may contribute to strengthen each other's hands in
   the work in which they are mutually engaged.

   "Having thus explained the views of the society, the managers would now
   call on their brethren and friends to unite with them, by establishing,
   wherever it is practicable, Sunday school associations auxiliary to
   this society. To give a direction to this work, and to produce as much
   uniformity as local circumstances will allow, the form of a
   constitution suitable for auxiliary societies is herewith submitted.

   "One principal reason for locating the parent society in New York, in
   preference to any other place, is the facilities afforded by our Book
   Concern for printing and circulating books. The agents of that growing
   establishment hold an extensive correspondence with every part of our
   country, and possess the readiest means of communicating information on
   every subject connected with Sunday school instruction, and can supply
   any auxiliary with books on the shortest notice and cheapest terms. And
   it will be perceived, by an article in the constitution, that by paying
   three dollars into the funds of the institution, sending a list of its
   officers, and a copy of its annual report, an auxiliary is entitled to
   purchase books at the reduced prices. A list of the books, with the
   prices annexed, will hereafter be furnished through the medium of the
   Advocate and Journal.

   "That an itinerating ministry possesses advantages peculiar to itself,
   in promoting objects of benevolence, will not be, by any, disputed.
   This, as well as the manner in which our Book Concern is conducted,
   supersedes the necessity and the expense of employing separate agencies
   in order to carry on the work of Sunday school instruction. The funds,
   therefore, which may be raised, can be appropriated to the purchase of
   books.

   "It will be perceived from the constitution, that it is the design of
   this society, by means of auxiliaries, to comprehend every part of our
   Church in this great and good cause. The senior bishop is constituted
   the president, and the other four bishops are vice presidents; and
   provision is made for each annual conference to elect a vice president
   from its own body; and he board of managers being located in New York,
   a center of union is formed for the whole community, and all being
   connected with our Book Concern, an easy channel of communication is
   opened, by which books may be printed and circulated, and remittances
   and information made and received.

   "These being the views and objects of the society, the managers think
   that they may confidently call on their brethren and friends for their
   aid and cooperation. To the ministers of the Church, especially, do
   they look for an efficient effort in carrying the benevolent design
   into practical operation. Let them think on the numerous children
   unbosomed in the Church, which they are appointed to nourish with the
   sincere milk of the word. These are the lambs of the flock, which, that
   they may become the sheep of God's pasture, must be tenderly nursed.
   Let them, therefore, be gathered into the fold of sabbath schools, put
   under the care of faithful shepherds, who will watch over their
   welfare, instill into their minds moral and religious truth, and thus
   prepare them, under the influence of divine grace, to become faithful
   followers of the chief Shepherd and Bishop of their souls.

   "The managers conclude by commending their cause to God and to the
   prayers of their brethren, that they may be wisely directed in this
   arduous enterprise, and by saying that any suggestion, by which the
   system may be improved, so as to accomplish more perfectly the purposes
   of its organization, will be thankfully received and duly considered."

   The following article in the constitution of the society will show what
   were its objects: --

   "The objects of this society shall be, to promote the formation and to
   concentrate the efforts of sabbath schools connected with the
   congregations of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and all others that
   may become auxiliary; to aid in the instruction of the rising
   generation, particularly in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, and
   in the service and worship of God."

   Provision was then made for the formation of auxiliary societies, and
   other matters usually connected with Sunday school operations, for
   furnishing books, funds, &c.

   The constitution was adopted and the society formed on the second day
   of April, 1827, and it commenced its operations under the most
   favorable auspices. The measure, indeed, was very generally approved.,
   and hailed with grateful delight by our brethren and friends throughout
   the country. It received the sanction of the several annual
   conferences, who recommended to the people of their charge to form
   auxiliary societies in every circuit and station, and send to the
   general depository in New York for their books; and such were the zeal
   and unanimity with which they entered into this work, that a the first
   annual meeting of the society there were reported 251 auxiliary
   societies, 1,025 schools, 2,045 superintendents, 10,290 teachers, and
   63,240 scholars, besides about 2,000 managers and visitors. Never,
   therefore, did an institution go into operation under more favorable
   circumstances, or was hailed with a more universal joy, than the Sunday
   School Union of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

   Our separation, however, from the general union, and the establishment
   of a distinct organization, provoked no little opposition from some
   quarters, and led the managers into an investigation of the origin of
   Sunday schools, both in Europe and America, and the facts elicited were
   spread before the community in their first annual report. By this it
   appeared, as before stated, that although Mr. Raikes might have been
   the first to organize regular sabbath schools in England, yet Mr.
   Wesley was among the first to patronize them, and the very first to
   furnish teachers who gave their services gratuitously; that even the
   British and Foreign Bible Society originated from the exertions of a
   Methodist preacher who had been laboring in the sabbath school cause in
   Wales; and that in America they had been taught among the Methodists,
   amidst storms of reproach and persecution, long before they were ever
   thought of by other denominations. These facts were amply ported by
   irrefutable testimony, and they therefore served to put the question at
   rest respecting the origin and permanent establishment of sabbath
   schools in England, and their subsequent progress in this country. [21]

   That the formation of this society has had a most happy effect upon the
   interests of the rising generation, particularly those under the
   influence of our own denomination, there can be no doubt. As many of
   our people were not pleased with the movements of the American Union,
   and some who were connected with it felt dissatisfied in that relation,
   they had not entered so heartily nor so generally as was desirable into
   the work of sabbath school instruction; but now, every objection
   arising from these sources being removed, a general and almost
   simultaneous action in favor of this important cause commenced
   throughout our ranks, and it has continued steadily increasing to the
   present time, exerting a hallowing influence upon all who come under
   its control and direction.

   And we rejoice to know that the American Union, as well as those
   existing separately among other denominations, has exerted, and is
   still exerting, a Similar in influence on all who come within the
   sphere of its and their operations. Let them be conducted in the fear
   of God, under the superintendence of men and women who enjoy and
   exemplify experimental and practical godliness, and they shall form an
   effectual barrier against the overflowings of infidelity and its
   kindred errors and vices, and continue as a lofty beacon to direct the
   youthful mind into the channel of gospel truth and holiness. The mere
   question of their origin, however honorable it may be to their
   originator, is lost amidst the blaze of glory which shall surround the
   churches by the conscientious labors of those who have conducted and
   shall continue to conduct them forward in the spirit of Him who said,
   "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of
   such is the kingdom of God," and who "out of the mouths of babes and
   sucklings hath perfected praise." The high approbation of God is to be
   prized above a thousand wreaths of mere human laurels. The latter will
   fade and die, while the former will cause the individual on whom it
   falls to bloom in immortal vigor around the throne above. Instead,
   therefore, of contending about the fact to whom the honor belongs of
   beginning this mighty machinery which is performing such wonders of
   mercy to the rising generation, let us bless God for raising up such a
   man as Raikes, for such a powerful patron as Wesley, and for inspiring
   so many of his servants to exert their strength to perpetuate this
   means of doing good from one generation to another.

   The Cherokee mission, within the bounds of the Tennessee conference,
   was extending its influence among that nation with encouraging success.
   Last year there were four missionaries appointed to labor here, who
   formed regular circuits, and divided the native converts, now
   consisting of about four hundred, into classes, and furnished them with
   the ordinances of the gospel. A native preacher, by the name of Turtle
   Fields, had been raised up, who became eminently useful to his
   brethren, as he could speak to them in their own language of the
   "wonderful works of God."

   Though it was the practice of all our missionaries who were sent among
   the aboriginal tribes, first of all to preach to them the gospel of
   Christ, yet when they had embraced it, and became reformed in heart and
   life, they generally forsook their former mode of living, and entered
   upon the arts of civilized man. Indeed, this was the secret of our
   success. Every attempt which had been made to reform the savages of our
   wildernesses, by introducing the arts of civilization first, and by
   initiating them into the knowledge of letters before they were
   converted to Christianity, has failed of success. Instead of pursuing
   this round-about method to bring them to the knowledge of God and of
   his Son Jesus Christ, our missionaries have addressed themselves
   directly to their hearts, recited to them the simple narrative of the
   life, the sufferings, the death, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
   and impressed upon their minds the grand truth, that all this was for
   them, and that, in believing it heartily, even they should be "saved
   from their sins." This method, and this only, has taken effect. A
   believing knowledge of the love of God in Christ Jesus has melted them
   into tenderness; and the light of divine truth, thus shining upon their
   hearts, has revealed to them their wretchedness as sinners, and brought
   them as humble penitents to the foot of the cross, where they have
   waited in humble supplication until Christ made them free. And then,
   after being thus liberated from the bondage of sin, and brought into
   the liberties of the gospel, they have been conducted with the utmost
   ease to the practice of the domestic arts, and to all the usages of
   civilized life.

   This was the case with these converted Cherokees and others. "The
   traveler," says the report of the committee of the Tennessee conference
   for this year, "through their settlements, observing cottages erecting,
   regular towns building, farms cultivated, the sabbath regularly
   observed, and almost an entire change in the character and pursuits of
   the people, is ready to ask, with surprise, Whence this change? The
   answer is, The Lord Jesus, in answer to the prayers of thousands of his
   people, is receiving the accomplishment of the promise, I will give
   thee the heathen for thine inheritance. Here is a nation at our door,
   our neighbors," (once) "remarkable for their ferocity and ignorance,
   now giving the most striking evidence of the utility of missionary
   exertions." Two houses of worship had been erected, one of which,
   having been consumed by fire, was rebuilt this year by the natives
   themselves, without any expense to the mission.

   For the benefit of the youth schools were established, and the children
   soon gave evidence of their capacity and willingness to learn, two of
   whom gave promise of usefulness as preachers of the gospel to their own
   nation. These were placed under the special care of the Rev. William
   McMahon, the superintendent of the mission. So evident was the change
   which had been wrought in the hearts and lives of these people, that
   even those who had no interest in the mission were constrained to
   acknowledge the hand of God. So rapidly, indeed, did the work spread,
   that in 1825 the number of converted natives had increased to eight
   hundred, and seven missionaries were employed in that interesting field
   of labor, including Turtle Fields, who was now eminently distinguished
   for his deep piety, and diligence in promoting the interests of the
   mission. The white missionaries were also greatly assisted by another
   converted Cherokee, a young man of promising talents and piety, who
   acted as an interpreter to the circuit preacher.

   A new mission was begun this year among another branch of the
   Mississaugas, who resided on Snake and Yellow Head Islands, in Lake
   Simcoe, Upper Canada. The whole body of Indians who resided here
   consisted of six hundred, the largest body of any who spoke the
   Chippeway language this side of Lake Huron. Some of these, hearing a
   discourse from one of our preachers, became deeply impressed with the
   leading truths of Christianity, and expressed an earnest desire to have
   a missionary sent to instruct them. Accordingly some benevolent members
   of our Church went and established a sabbath school among them. By this
   simple means more than forty were reclaimed from their pagan
   superstitions. Such was the success of this mission, after being
   supplied with a regular missionary, that in 1829 there were four
   hundred and twenty-nine under religious instruction, three hundred and
   fifty of whom were orderly members of the Church; one hundred of their
   children were taught in two separate schools, by a male and female
   teacher. A schoolhouse and parsonage were built on Snake Island, and a
   mission-house on Yellow Head Island, and the converts were gradually
   brought to attend to agricultural and domestic duties.

   The other aboriginal missions, heretofore mentioned, were still
   improving in religion and morals, as well as in the arts of civilized
   life, and great was the interest manifested by the Christian church in
   their behalf. This year, however, the Wyandot mission suffered a great
   loss in the death of Between-the-logs, one of their most eminent
   chiefs, and an eloquent and able advocate of Christianity. And as he
   was a chief man among then, and, after his conversion, had exerted a
   powerful influence in favor of the mission, it is presumed that the
   reader will be pleased with the following particulars of his life and
   death, which the author of the History of the Missions under the care
   of the Methodist Episcopal Church prepared for and published in that
   work.

   "He was born, it is said, in the neighborhood of Lower Sandusky, about
   the year 1780. [22] His father was of the Seneca, and his mother a
   Wyandot of the Bear tribe, from whom he derived his name,
   Between-the-logs, the name which they give to a bear, signifying to
   crouch between the logs, because this animal, under peculiar
   circumstances, lies down between logs; hence the name Between-the-logs,
   a literal translation of the Bear tribe, was a distinctive appellation
   of the tribe to which he belonged, and of which he became a chief.

   "As he acted a conspicuous part in the nation, and finally became very
   eminently useful in the cause of Christianity, the following brief
   account of his life and death will doubtless be acceptable to the
   reader. When about nine years of age his father and mother separated,
   and Between-the-logs remained with his father until the death of the
   latter, when he returned to his mother among the Wyandots. Soon after
   this he joined the Indian warriors who were defeated by General Wayne.
   His prompt obedience to the chief, his enterprising disposition, and
   the faithful discharge of his duties, called him into public notice,
   and finally raised him to be a chief of the nation; and the soundness
   of his judgment, his good memory, and his great powers of eloquence,
   procured for him the office of chief speaker, and the confidential
   adviser of the head chief.

   "When about twenty-five years of age, he was sent to ascertain the
   doctrines and pretensions of a reputed Seneca prophet, whose imposture
   he soon detected, and some years after he went on a similar errand to a
   noted Shawnee prophet, a brother of the famous Tecumseh, with whom he
   stayed nearly a year; and being fully convinced himself, he was enabled
   to convince others, that their pretensions to the spirit of prophecy
   were all a deception.

   "At the commencement of hostilities between this country and Great
   Britain, in 1812, in company with the head chief of the nation, he
   attended a great council of the northern Indians, collected to
   deliberate on the question whether they should join the British against
   the Americans. Here, although powerfully opposed, and even threatened
   with death if he did not join them, Between-the-logs utterly refused to
   take up arms against his American brethren, and exerted all his powers
   to dissuade the Wyandots from involving themselves in this quarrel.
   Soon after, he and the majority of the warriors belonging to the
   Wyandots joined the American standard, and accompanied General Harrison
   in his invasion of Upper Canada. At the conclusion of the war he
   settled with his brother at Upper Sandusky, and, like most of the
   savages, indulged himself in intemperance. In one of his fits of
   intoxication he unfortunately murdered his wife; but, on coming to
   himself, the recollection of this horrid deed made such an impression
   on his mind, that he almost entirely abandoned the use of ardent
   spirits ever afterward.

   "In 1817 Between-the logs had an opportunity of displaying his love of
   justice in behalf of his nation. The Wyandots being persuaded by
   intriguing men to sign a treaty for the sale of their lands, contrary
   to his earnest expostulations, he, in company with some others,
   undertook a journey to Washington on their own responsibility, without
   consulting any one. When introduced to the secretary of war, the
   secretary observed to them that he had received no notice of their
   coming from any of the government agents. To this Between-the logs
   replied, with noble freedom, We got up and came of ourselves -- we
   believed the great road was free to us.' He plead the cause of the
   Indians with such forcible eloquence before the heads of departments at
   Washington, that they obtained an enlargement of territory, and an
   increase of their annuities.

   "Of his having embraced the gospel, and the aid he rendered to the
   missionaries to extend its influence among his people, an account has
   already been given. His understanding being enlightened by divine
   truth, and his heart moved with compassion for the salvation of his
   countrymen, he exerted all his powers to bring them to the knowledge of
   the truth; and such was the success of his efforts, that his brethren
   gave him license, first to exhort, and then to preach. Some of his
   speeches before the Ohio conference, which he attended several times,
   did honor equally to his head and heart, and powerfully enlisted the
   feelings of the conference in behalf of the mission.

   "In the year 1826, he and Mononcue accompanied Mr. Finley on a visit
   from Sandusky to New York, where they attended several meetings, and
   among others the anniversary of the Female Missionary Society of New
   York. Here Between-the-logs spoke with great fire and animation,
   relating his own experience of divine things, and gave a brief
   narrative of the work of God among his people. Though he addressed the
   audience through an interpreter who spoke the English language but
   imperfectly, yet his speech had a powerful effect upon those who heard
   him. His voice was musical, his gestures graceful, significant, and
   dignified, and his whole demeanor bespoke a soul full of lofty ideas
   and full of God. On one occasion he remarked, that when at home he had
   been accustomed to be addressed by his brethren, but that since he had
   come here he had heard nothing that he understood, and added, I wonder
   if the people understand one another', for I see but little effect
   produced by what is said.' After a few words spoken in reply to this
   remark, by way of explanation and apology, he kneeled down and offered
   a most fervent prayer to Almighty God. In this journey, as they passed
   through the country, they visited Philadelphia, Baltimore, and several
   of the intervening villages, and held meetings, and took up collections
   for the benefit of the mission. This tended to excite a missionary
   spirit among the people, and everywhere Between-the-logs was hailed as
   a monument of divine mercy and grace, and as a powerful advocate for
   the cause of Christianity; and he, together with those who accompanied
   him, left a most favorable impression behind them of the good effects
   of the gospel on the savage mind and heart.

   "It was very evident to all who beheld him that he could not long
   continue an inhabitant of this world. Already the consumption was
   making fearful inroads upon his constitution, and his continual labors
   in the gospel contributed to hasten its progress to its fatal
   termination. Very soon after his return to his nation he was confined
   to his bed. Being asked respecting the foundation of his hope, he
   replied, It is in the mercy of God in Christ.' I asked him,' says Mr.
   Gilruth, who was at this time the missionary, of his evidence;' he
   said, It is the comfort of the Spirit.' I asked him if he was afraid to
   die;' he said, I am not.' Are you resigned to go?' He cried, I have
   felt some desires of the world, but they are all gone, and I now feel
   willing to die or live, as God sees best.' The day before he died he
   was visited by Mr. Finley, to whom he expressed his unshaken confidence
   in God, and a firm hope, through Jesus Christ, of eternal life. He
   finally died in peace, leaving his nation to mourn the loss of a chief
   and a minister of Jesus Christ to whom they felt themselves much
   indebted for his many exertions both for their temporal and spiritual
   prosperity."

   Some new settlements in Upper Canada, which had not hitherto been
   supplied with the word of life, were this year visited by the Rev.
   George Poole, as a missionary; these formed the Richmond mission; and
   Mr. Poole succeeded in procuring twelve preaching places, and two
   hundred Church members were returned on the Minutes for the next year.

   The work of God in the older circuits and stations was this year very
   generally in a prosperous state. Among other places which had been
   visited with the reviving influences of God's Spirit, the city of New
   York shared in a considerable degree. Last year a new church had been
   erected in Willett Street, which was dedicated to the service of
   Almighty God on May the 7th by Bishop McKendree, and was now well
   filled with attentive hearers. The congregation in this place had been
   raised chiefly by the labors of local preachers, assisted occasionally
   by the preachers stationed in New York, who held their meetings in a
   private room, then in a school-room, when in 1819 they occupied a
   mission-house in Broome Street, which had been built by the mission
   board of the Presbyterian Church, for the purpose of instructing
   profligate females; but this plan not succeeding according to the
   benevolent design of its patrons, the house was rented to our trustees,
   and the appointment was taken into the regular plan, and supplied by
   the stationed preachers.

   God honored this place by giving sanction to the labors of his
   servants; and in 1823 a gracious work commenced, which had continued
   with more or less success until the time of which we now speak. Since
   the new house had been occupied the work of formation had much
   increased, so that about one hundred and twenty bad been added to the
   church from the month of June to February. Gracious seasons of
   refreshing were also blessing the other churches of the city during the
   year, so that about three hundred and sixty were added to the Church,
   including white and colored.

   It seems that very considerable accessions had been made to the church
   in the city of New Haven during the years of 1826 and 1827, under the
   labors of the Rev. Heman Bangs; and as this is a very important
   position in the state of Connecticut, perhaps a short narrative of the
   work in this place may not be unacceptable to the reader. New Haven,
   indeed, may be considered the Athens of this part of New England, being
   delightfully situated at the head of a convenient harbor, on a sandy
   plain, just at the termination of those high bluffs called "East and
   West Rocks," which rise to the height of about four hundred feet, from
   the summit of which the admirer of natural scenery, beautified by the
   works of art, may have an extensive and charming view of the
   surrounding country, the city, the harbor, and the neighboring
   villages. Here, amidst artificial groves, which render New Haven one of
   the most rural and pleasant cities on the continent, Yale College rears
   its stately buildings, together with churches and other public as well
   as private edifices.

   We have already seen that the Rev. Jesse Lee, as early as 1789, visited
   this place; but the first class was formed by the Rev. Daniel
   Ostrander, who entered the traveling ministry in 1793, and has
   continued from that time to this in the itinerant field. This was in
   the year 1795; and William Thacher and Pember Jocelyn were among the
   first who joined the Methodist Episcopal Church in New Haven; the
   former joined the traveling connection in 1797, and has continued a
   faithful laborer to this day; and the latter became a local preacher,
   and continued, amidst much opposition, in the early days of Methodism,
   faithful until death. The first heralds of the cross who visited New
   Haven found a resting-place in the house of Mr. Gilbert, who, thou
   dead, yet speaketh in his children and grandchildren, who are following
   the steps of their sire in the way to heaven, being members of the same
   Church of which he became an early member and supporter.

   But though Methodism had this early beginning in New Haven, the number
   of its disciples was few, and they remained in a feeble state until
   they were detached from the circuit and organized as a separate station
   in 1813, and even for some years after their increase was but small. In
   the succeeding year the Rev. Gad Smith, a young preacher of good
   talents, remarkable for the purity of his mind, great simplicity of
   intention, and fidelity in his work, was stationed in New Haven, and he
   brought the members into gospel order, built them up in love, and laid
   a foundation for their future prosperity. Such a laborer, indeed, is
   rarely found so prudent, so entirely devoted to his work, and so
   indefatigable in his endeavors to do good to others. But,
   notwithstanding his pious labors and prudent conduct, the society did
   not rise into much strength until they succeeded, in 1821 and 1822, by
   the laudable exertions of the Rev. William Thacher, in building them a
   commodious house of worship, which was completed and dedicated to God
   in the spring of 1822, near the termination of Mr. Thacher's labors.
   During the three years, namely, from 1819 to 1822, the society had
   increased from thirty-six whites and thirty-five colored to two hundred
   whites and five colored; [23] and they had steadily persevered,
   enlarging their borders and extending their influence, until this year
   they numbered two hundred and sixteen whites and two colored. They had
   been blessed with several powerful revivals, and a considerable
   accession of members, but the constant emigration to the west bad
   prevented a proportionate increase to their membership.

   Revivals of religion were quite prevalent this year in various places;
   but as I have heretofore so fully narrated the progress of the work,
   particularly its commencement in any given place, it is judged
   inexpedient to enter into further details in this place. The results
   may be seen by a reference to the general increase.

   An academy had been commenced at Readfield, under the patronage of the
   Maine conference, with which manual labor was connected, embracing
   agricultural and mechanical arts. A benevolent individual consecrated a
   portion of his wealth, ten thousand dollars, toward the founding of
   this institution, and it received the sanction of the state by an act
   of incorporation, under the title of "The Maine Wesleyan Seminary."
   Here by means of manual labor, the physical as well as mental and moral
   powers of the student are trained to industry, and thus that sickly
   constitution, so often the effect of severe study in youth, is
   prevented, and the "piercing wit and active limb" become mutual aids to
   each other. In addition to a thorough English education, a regular
   classical course is pursued, by which the student is fitted to enter
   college, or upon the more active duties of life.

   Sixty-three had located, seventy-seven returned supernumerary,
   eighty-seven superannuated, one had withdrawn, and six had been
   expelled. The following had died: -- Archibald McElroy, John Walker,
   James R. Keach, Arthur McClure, Ellison Taylor, Philip Bruce, James
   Smith, John Collins, John Creamer, Seth Crowell, John Shaw, and
   Freeborn Garrettson.

   In writing some of these names, we can hardly avoid the reflection, how
   fast, one after another, the aged veterans of Methodism, who saw it in
   its first glory, and had contributed so much, by their labors and
   sacrifices, to lay the foundation for its future prosperity, were
   removed from the earthly to the heavenly tabernacle. Had I the time,
   how I should delight to linger along their path, mark their progress,
   often amidst storms of persecution, tears of sorrow, mingled indeed
   with shouts of triumph, while they held up the banner of the cross to
   the listening multitudes who hung on their lips for instruction! Those,
   indeed, were the chivalrous days of Methodism, when Bruce and
   Garrettson, often side by side, and then again in separate and distant
   fields of action, were fighting the battles of their Lord, almost
   single-handed, and crying, with a loud and distinct voice, to sinners
   to repent and give glory to God. Such were the men, and such their
   work, that their names will be transmitted to posterity, surrounded
   with that halo of glory which can be won only by those who have devoted
   themselves to so noble a work with such a disinterested zeal as shall
   put to silence that caviling criticism which would transmute a human
   infirmity into a moral delinquency, and bury real excellence beneath
   the rubbish of those imperfections which are inseparable from human
   beings. For such cavilings we have no fellowship. But for the stern and
   uncompromising virtues which adorned and fortified the souls of those
   devoted men of God, several of whose names, accompanied with sketches
   of their labors and characters, have already been recorded, who first
   stood on the walls of our Zion, a veneration is felt which it is
   difficult either to repress or express. Who does not feel the kindlings
   of gratitude to God for raising up such men, qualifying them for their
   work, directing and sustaining them in its performance, and then taking
   them to their final reward?

   We trace Philip Bruce back to the persecuted Huguenots, whose ancestors
   fled to this country to avoid the fury of Louis XIV and his bigoted
   counselors, who drove those devoted men from the kingdom merely because
   they would not bow the knee to a wafer god, and acknowledge the pope as
   the infallible head of the church. His ancestors settled in North
   Carolina, where Philip was born, [24] and in early life, by the
   assiduity of a pious mother, he was taught the fear of God, experienced
   a change of heart, and, with her, connected himself with the Methodist
   societies. In 1781, three years before the organization of our Church,
   he entered the itinerant field of gospel labor, in which he continued
   faithful until the day of his death. For forty-five years did he stand
   as a sentinel the walls of our Zion, giving a faithful warning, to all
   who came within the sound of his voice, of the dangers of a life of
   sin, and encouraging those who were attempting to "flee the wrath to
   come," to seek for shelter under the wing of God's mercy. During the
   whole of this time, some periods of which were seasons of no little
   peril and suffering, Philip Bruce kept his eye fixed steadily upon the
   "mark of the prize of his high calling," nor deviated from the
   straightforward path, until he happily reached the goal for which he
   run. He traveled extensively on various circuits, presided over several
   districts, and was sometimes spoken of as a suitable person to fill the
   office of a superintendent; and wherever he traveled, or whatever
   station he filled, he won the confidence of his brethren by the honest
   purpose of his heart, the blamelessness of his life, and by the ability
   and zeal with which he discharged his high and holy duties.

   He was not naturally fluent as a speaker. Considered, therefore, simply
   as a pulpit orator, he had many defects, often hesitating, as though he
   hardly knew how to give utterance to his thoughts. Yet the evident
   sincerity of his heart, manifested by the purity of his life, his
   knowledge of the sacred Scriptures his sound understanding, and
   prudence of conduct, gave weight to his words, and commanded attention
   and respect.

   If I were to select any traits of character, by which to distinguish
   him among others, I should say they were meekness and diffidence. These
   seemed to shine through all his actions, to sit prominently on his
   countenance, and to dictate and guide him in all he said and did. He
   thus imbibed the sacred lesson taught by his Lord and Master, "Learn of
   me, for I am meek and lowly of heart."

   In his public addresses he was wont to interrupt the regular chain of
   discourse by putting up a fervent ejaculation to God for divine aid,
   and for a blessing upon his labors -- a practice which was very common
   among the older Methodist preachers, arising, no doubt, from a feeling
   sense of their dependence on God for help.

   The late Dr. William Phoebus, speaking of Philip Bruce, remarked, that
   once, while hearing him preach, he began to hesitate, as if at a loss
   what to say next, and then broke forth in prayer, and finally said to
   the people, "I beg of you to pray for me, for you know that I cannot
   preach unless assisted from above." This broke him loose from his
   embarrassment, and he went on with his discourse, to the astonishment
   of all present. At other times there was an air of pleasantness -- not
   trifling -- arising, apparently, from the buoyancy of his spirits,
   which made him extremely agreeable to those intimately acquainted with
   him, but which sometimes presented him unfavorably to others. With him,
   however, all was sincerity, aiming constantly to benefit his fellow-men
   by the best means he could select.

   In 1817, with much reluctance, as though unwilling to acknowledge
   himself outdone by any, he took a superannuated relation, and removed
   soon after to Elk river, in the state of Tennessee, and spent the
   remainder of his days there with his aged mother and his brethren.
   Ascertaining that it was his intention to move to that part of the
   country, his brethren in the Virginia conference, many of whom had been
   raised under his fostering care, affectionately and earnestly requested
   him to remain among them, which, however, he respectfully declined. And
   nothing can more strikingly show the strength of their affection for
   him, and evince the high estimation in which he was held, than the
   fact, that not long before his death the Virginia conference sent him
   an invitation to pay them a friendly visit, that they might once more
   mingle their prayers and praise together. This also he declined in the
   following words: --

   "Many affectionate ties bind me to the Virginia conference. Your
   expressions of good-will have awakened the tenderest friendships of my
   soul; but it is very probable that I shall never see you again; for
   though in my zeal I sometimes try to preach, my preaching is like old
   Priam's dart -- thrown by an arm enfeebled with age. Indeed, my work is
   well nigh done, and I am waiting in glorious expectation for my change
   to come; for I have not labored and suffered for naught, nor followed a
   cunningly devised fable."

   Not long after, his expectation, in regard to his departure to another
   world, was realized. On the 10th of May, 1826, at the house of his
   brother, Mr. Joel Bruce, who lived in the county of Giles, Tennessee,
   this tried veteran of Christ died in the triumph of faith, surrounded
   by his friends, sealing by his dying testimony the truth and power of
   that religion which he had recommended to others for forty-five years.

   The name of Freeborn Garrettson is familiar to most of my readers. Of
   the early days of his ministry, and of the sufferings he endured in the
   cause of his Divine Master, as well as his success in winning souls to
   Christ, an ample account has been given in the preceding volumes of
   this History; and those who wish to see these things in a more full and
   minute detain, are referred to his biography, which has been published
   and extensively circulated.

   He may be said to have been one of the early pioneers of Methodism in
   this country, for he joined the itinerant connection in 1775, when only
   twenty-three years of age, and was employed for many years in forming
   new circuits and districts, in which he was eminently useful. At the
   time of his admission into the itinerant ranks, in 1775, the number of
   preachers was only 19, and members in the societies 3,145; and at the
   time of his death, in 1827, these had increased to 1,642 preachers, and
   Church members 421,105; and perhaps no individual preacher contributed
   more, if indeed as much, to promote this spread of the work, than the
   Rev. Freeborn Garrettson. Young, vigorous, unreservedly devoted to God,
   and exceedingly zealous for the salvation of souls, wherever he went he
   carried the flame of divine love with him, breathing it out in the most
   pointed and earnest appeals to the consciences of sinners, and in the
   soothing words of promise and encouragement to mourning penitents. Nor
   was he less earnest in pressing believers forward in the path of humble
   obedience, that they might attain the heights and depths of redeeming
   love.

   From his entrance upon this work until 1784 he traveled extensively
   through the states of North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland --
   his native state -- Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; and in all
   these states he preached the word with peculiar success, thousands
   hanging upon his lips with eager attention, and hundreds also bearing
   witness to the truths he delivered by the reformation which was
   effected in their hearts and lives through his instrumentality. And
   though his enemies thought to confine him in the prisons to which they
   committed him "for the testimony of Jesus," they were disappointed in
   their expectation by the overruling providence of God, so that even
   their wrath "was made to praise him." In those places where he so
   labored and suffered, the name of Freeborn Garrettson was long
   remembered by many of the first generation of Methodists, associated
   with the grateful recollection that he was their spiritual father; and
   on his subsequent visits, when time had wrinkled his brows and they had
   grown old in the service of their Lord and Master, the fires of their
   first love were enkindled afresh, and they mingled their songs of
   thanksgiving together for the "former and the latter rains" of divine
   grace. How sweet were these recollections!

   He was one of the little veteran band that so nobly withstood the
   innovators upon Wesleyan Methodism in 1778 and 1779, when it required
   all the united wisdom, prudence, forbearance, and cautious foresight of
   Asbury and his associates, who stood by him, to check the froward zeal
   of those who would run before they were sent, to lay on hands suddenly,
   and to administer the ordinances without proper authority. He stood
   firm to his purpose, and assisted in keeping the ship to her moorings,
   until the Christmas conference furnished her with suitable rigging, and
   set her afloat, properly manned and officered, with well-authenticated
   certificates of their character and authority to act as her commanders
   and conductors.

   Garrettson was also among those memorable men to whom Dr. Coke first
   unfolded the plan devised by Wesley for the organization of the
   Methodist societies in America into a church. At the request of Asbury
   and Coke, he "went," says the latter, "like an arrow," to call the
   preachers together in the city of Baltimore on the 25th of December,
   1754, where they matured those plans and adopted those measures which
   have proved such a lasting blessing to the Methodist community in this
   country. In the midst of this assembly, which, though few in numbers,
   was composed of some of the choicest spirits of the age, stood
   Garrettson, young, ardent, full of zeal for God, and giving his counsel
   in favor of the system of rules, orders, and ordinances submitted to
   them by Coke, under the sanction of Wesley. With Asbury, Dickens, Reed,
   Gill, Pedicord, Ware, Tunnell, Phoebus, and others, of precious memory,
   fathers in our Israel, he commingled his prayers and counsels, and thus
   contributed to lay, deep and wide, the foundation of that spiritual
   edifice which, by the blessing of God on their labors, even he lived to
   see neared in beauty and glory, and under whose roof many a wanderer
   has sought shelter and rest.

   He was also the first Methodist preacher in this country who went on a
   foreign mission. Having received the order of an elder at the Christmas
   conference, and being solicited by Dr. Coke to embark on a mission to
   Nova Scotia, he cheerfully relinquished home and kindred, and went to
   that distant province of the British empire to carry the glad tidings
   of salvation to the lost. Here, amid summer's heat and winter's cold,
   and sometimes hunger and thirst, be continued about two years,
   traveling extensively, preaching the word with diligence, and rejoicing
   over penitent sinners who were returning to God; and such was their
   affection and respect for his character, that, had they won his
   consent, they would most gladly have retained him as their permanent
   superintendent, and that, too, under the sanction of both Wesley and
   Coke.

   But his Lord had other work for him to do. Not long after his return
   from Nova Scotia, namely, in 1755, Mr. Garrettson penetrated through
   the country north of the city of New York, on both sides the Hudson
   river, where the voice of a Methodist preacher was never before heard.
   Here, in the character of a presiding elder, he gave direction to the
   labors of several young preachers, who spread themselves through the
   country, north and south, reaching even to Vermont, proclaiming, in all
   places where they went, the unsearchable riches of Christ. By these
   labors a foundation was laid for that work of God in those more
   northern states of the confederacy which has since spread so gloriously
   among the people.

   But we cannot follow him in all his useful movements, from one year to
   another, through the different parts of the country. Suffice it to say
   here, that he continued with unabated ardor and diligence in his
   Master's work until the year 1817, when, contrary to his wishes, for he
   seemed loath to believe himself unable to perform efficient service, he
   was returned a supernumerary. This, however, by no means abridged his
   labors. Though cut loose from the regular work, he still pursued the
   path of usefulness, making occasional excursions east and west, north
   and south, exhibiting the same fervor of spirit, the same breathing
   after immortality and eternal life, by which he had ever been
   characterized.

   In 1791 Mr. Garrettson saw fit to exchange the single for a married
   life, and his choice fell upon a woman, Miss Catharine Livingston, of
   Rhinebeck, N.Y., who was every way fitted, both from education and
   piety, to assist him in the grand work in which he had engaged. This
   also furnished him with means to preach the gospel without fee or
   reward, as well as to exhibit the hospitalities of a liberal mind, and
   thereby to fulfill the apostolic precept, "For a bishop" (or elder)
   "must be given to hospitality." From the time of his settlement at
   Rhinebeck, where he located his family, his house and heart were open
   to receive and welcome the messengers of God; and around his hospitable
   board have they often, from year to year, mingled their friendly souls
   in conversation, prayer, and praise; nor could these guests depart
   without carrying with them grateful recollections of the gospel
   simplicity, courtesy, and liberality with which they had been
   entertained.

   But the time at last arrived when this man of God, one of the
   patriarchs of American Methodism, must resign up his breath to God who
   gave it. In the seventy-sixth year of his age, and fifty-second of his
   ministry, he ended his days in peace, surrounded by his friends, and
   consoled by the hope of everlasting life.

   In contemplating the character of Mr. Garrettson, we may behold a
   cluster of those excellences which dignify and adorn the man and the
   minister, and which qualify him for usefulness in the world. But that
   which eminently distinguished him, both in public and private, was the
   simplicity, or singleness of heart, with which he deported himself on
   all occasions. This sterling virtue kept him at an equal distance from
   the corrodings of jealousy and the repinings of suspicion. A single
   desire to know the good and the right way, to walk in it himself, and
   induce others to follow his example, most evidently characterized his
   mind, and guided him in all his proceedings.

   This singleness of heart, which had its seat in pure love to God and
   man, first led him forth in search of the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel, sustained him under his labors and trials, kept him humble in
   the midst of his prosperity, and in seasons of popularity among the
   friends of the cause in which he was engaged. No one could be long in
   his company, nor often hear him preach, without perceiving this honest
   simplicity of intention shining out among the other graces of his mind,
   guiding and actuating the entire man in all his movements. And this
   arose from the purity of his heart and the sanctity of his life. For no
   man, I presume to say, ever gave more irrefutable evidence of the
   holiness of his heart and the blamelessness of his life, from the time
   of his entrance on his Christian course; about fifty-two years of which
   were spent as a public ambassador of Christ, than Freeborn Garrettson.
   What a living and speaking comment this upon the pure doctrines of
   Jesus Christ!

   His action in the pulpit was not graceful, though it was solemn and
   impressive. His sermons were sometimes enlivened by anecdotes of a
   character calculated to illustrate the points he was aiming to
   establish. He was likewise deficient in systematic arrangement and
   logical precision. This deficiency, however, was more than made up by
   the pointedness of his appeals to the conscience, the aptness of his
   illustrations from Scripture, the manner in which he explained and
   enforced the depth of Christian experience, and the holy fervor of
   spirit with which he delivered himself on all occasions. Like most
   other extemporaneous speakers, his mind sometimes seemed barren, and he
   failed, apparently for want of words, to express that on which his
   understanding appeared to be laboring. At other times his heart
   appeared full, his mind luminous, and he would pour forth a stream of
   gospel truth which abundantly refreshed the souls of God's people with
   the "living waters." And although his gesticulations were somewhat
   awkward, and his voice at times unmusical, especially when raised to a
   high key, there was that in his manner and matter which always rendered
   his preaching entertaining and useful; and seldom did the hearer tire
   under his administration of the word of life -- point, pathos, and
   variety generally characterizing all his discourses.

   Mr. Garrettson was a great friend to all our institutions, literary and
   religious. To the American Bible Society, and to our missionary and
   tract societies, he was a liberal contributor and a firm advocate. Nor
   were the worn-out preachers, their widows and orphans, forgotten in his
   benefactions. When acting in the capacity of a presiding elder, I have
   known him receive, and then give away to some poor preacher, his wife,
   or some dependent widow, his share of the quarterly allowance, as well
   as make special efforts among our more wealthy members and friends to
   replenish the funds instituted for these needy and deserving objects.

   But he has gone to his reward; and this record is made as a small
   tribute of respect to one who is dear in the recollections of many, in
   whose friendship the writer had the honor and happiness of sharing,
   whose example he would remember to imitate and transmit to others, that
   they may profit by calling it to recollection when he who now writes
   shall mingle his ashes with all that remains earthly of Garrettson, and
   his spirit, redeemed and purified by the blood of the Lamb, shall
   mingle -- O, may it be so! -- with his around the throne of God for
   ever.

   Two of the others who had taken their flight to another world deserve a
   passing notice.

   James Smith, of the Baltimore conference, when he ended his race, was
   comparatively young in the ministry. At the age of forty-three or
   forty-our, after having discharged the duties of an itinerant minister
   for twenty-four years, he departed in great peace of mind, in the city
   of Baltimore, surrounded by his Christian friends and brethren.

   He was a man of strong powers of mind, of a warm heart, and a
   cultivated intellect. His natural vivacity sometimes gave place to deep
   gloom, which almost unfitted him for the duties of his station, and
   made him a little burdensome to his friends. These temporary
   depressions of spirit, however, were but occasional spots which
   appeared to obscure the brilliancy of a mind well stored with useful
   knowledge, and to oppress a heart generally overflowing with the.
   kindliest feelings toward his brethren and friends.

   As a minister of Jesus Christ, he was a workman that needed not to be
   ashamed. He rose with the dignity of the subject which he attempted to
   explain, and sometimes spoke with an eloquence, energy, and pathos,
   which, while it delighted the hearer, filled him with adoring gratitude
   to that God who had given his servant the power thus to persuade
   sinners to be reconciled to God. He was therefore powerful in the
   pulpit, and strenuous in his endeavors to advance the cause of Jesus
   Christ.

   In the midst of the discussions which arose on the appointment of
   presiding elders, and other collateral subjects, which either directly
   or indirectly grew out of that, our brother Smith took a deep interest,
   being an advocate of what was considered the popular side of that
   question. Being young, ardent, full of zeal for any cause he might
   espouse, he has been heard sometimes on the floor of the General
   Conference in such strains of impassioned eloquence, that one would
   think it hardly possible to resist the force of his arguments and the
   directness of his appeals. But there was a particular excellence which
   mingled itself with all these debates. With whatever fervor of spirit,
   warmth of zeal, or power of argument he might enter the arena of
   controversy on these subjects, he always concluded with an expression
   of his perfect fellowship for those who dissented from him, and of his
   unabated attachment to the rules and constitution of the Church of his
   choice. I remember to have heard him on one of these occasions, I think
   it was in the year 1816, when, after running through the field of
   argument and illustration, to sustain his positions, and to prostrate,
   if possible, his antagonists, he concluded with these words: -- "If any
   man consider me his enemy because I differ from him in opinion, I want
   not that man for my friend."

   These words, delivered, apparently, with a heart overflowing with
   feelings of kindness toward all men, left an impression upon all minds,
   I should think, if I may judge others by myself, as favorable to the
   speaker's heart and affections, as did his arguments upon those who
   were most partial to his views. I remember well that Bishop McKendree,
   who was pointedly opposed to the theory of brother Smith, and who had
   heard some cutting remarks in the course of the speech, a few minutes
   only after this peroration was pronounced, took the orator in his arms
   in the most affectionate manner, as a token, I supposed, of his
   fellowship and kindly feelings.

   It was thought, however, by some of his intimate friends, that these
   discussions, which were continued in various forms, from one year to
   another, until they terminated at the Conference of 1825, so wore upon
   the nervous system of Mr. Smith that it accelerated the disease of
   which he died. His sensitive mind and warmth of affection led him to
   espouse any cause in which he engaged with the enthusiasm of an able
   advocate, and his delicate nerves vibrated under the continual
   irritation produced by coming in constant collision with other minds
   equal to his own, and with other arguments with which he found it
   difficult to grapple with success. He therefore finally sunk under the
   pressure of those causes, which surrounded him, and was consumed by the
   fires which burned within him.

   But that same talent which qualified him for a powerful debater enabled
   him to shine in the pulpit, and to develop the truths of the gospel
   with clearness and precision. If there was any fault in the style of
   his pulpit eloquence, it consisted in an apparent effort at
   originality, and a labor after a diction somewhat pompous, instead of
   being entirely natural, plain, and pointed. This caused an occasional
   obscurity, painful to the hearer, and which prevented the full flow of
   truth from entering the understanding and the heart.

   It could not be otherwise than that a man thus constituted should be
   amiable in his manners. Brother Smith, indeed, possessed the social
   qualities in a high degree, and was therefore a pleasant and edifying
   companion, and warm in his attachments. And nothing would tend so
   quickly and so effectually to relieve his soul from the burden of
   melancholy to which I have alluded as social intercourse, when some
   anecdote happily introduced would drive away the demon of gloom which
   occasionally hovered over his mind, and restore him to his wonted
   cheerfulness and colloquial vivacity.

   There were also a candor and frankness in his disposition and
   communications which at once allayed all suspicions of his intentions,
   and threw him into your arms "as a brother beloved." No double-meaning
   phrases, no studied ambiguity, like the responses of the heathen
   oracles, which might be susceptible of an interpretation to suit the
   occasion, marked and debased the conversation or conduct of James
   Smith. When you heard his words you knew his heart. When you received
   his declaration you had a pledge of his sentiments in the sincerity and
   candor with which he spoke, and therefore always felt yourself safe in
   his society, and no less pleased than edified by his conversation.

   It is indeed pleasant to linger along the path of such men, and call to
   our recollection those excellences which beautified their character,
   and made them so estimable in their day and generation. But we must
   check the current of our thoughts, and give place to some others
   equally entitled to notice, while we may be allowed to anticipate the
   day when, unencumbered by those infirmities "which flesh is heir to,"
   kindred spirits shall mingle their songs together around the throne of
   God and the Lamb.

   Seth Crowell was another who died in the meridian of life, and left
   behind him memorials of his fidelity in the cause of God. He entered
   the traveling ministry in 1801, and finished his course in the
   twenty-fifth year of his public labors.

   In the early days of his ministry he volunteered his services for Upper
   Canada, where he exhibited those talents for preaching, and that
   ardency of zeal, which much endeared him to the people in that
   province; and he left behind him many witnesses, converted under his
   preaching, of the power and skill with which he wielded "the sword of
   the Spirit." In 1806 and 1807 he was stationed in the city of New York,
   under the charge of the Rev. Aaron Hunt. Here a revival of religion
   commenced, such, I believe, as had never before been seen or felt in
   that city, and brother Crowell was one of the most active instruments
   by which it was promoted. It was during this powerful revival that the
   practice of inviting penitent sinners to come to the altar for prayers
   was first introduced. The honor of doing this, if I am rightly
   informed, belongs to brother A. Hunt, who resorted to it to prevent the
   confusion arising from praying for them in different parts of the
   church at the same time.

   In the midst of the shakings and tremblings among the congregations
   during this great work, Seth Crowell was eminently useful, preaching
   with the "Holy Ghost sent down from heaven," beseeching sinners to be
   reconciled to God, and accompanying all his efforts with mighty prayer
   and faith.

   But his great exertions and his abstemious manner of living soon made
   inroads upon his physical constitution, and this produced often a
   depression of spirits which rendered him sometimes quite unhappy. In
   consequence of these things he was obliged at times to remit his
   regular preaching, and seek to recruit his exhausted strength in a more
   retired sphere of labor.

   When, however, in the vigor of his strength, the warmth of his
   affections and his longing desires for the salvation of souls led him
   forth with great zeal, both in and out of the pulpit, and he sometimes
   preached with a power and eloquence which overwhelmed his congregations
   "with speechless awe and silent love." Nor was it mere declamation. His
   sermons were sometimes deeply argumentative, and his positions
   supported by Scripture texts so appositely, that it amounted to a moral
   demonstration of their truth; and not infrequently sinners would be
   constrained to cry aloud for mercy while he was making his searching
   appeals to their consciences.

   His preaching was frequently of a controversial character. Against the
   peculiarities of Calvinism and Unversalism he bore a strong and pointed
   testimony, delighting to exhibit the universal love of God to man on
   the one hand, and the great danger of abusing it on the other, by
   obstinately refusing to comply with the conditions of the gospel And
   his sermons on these occasions were sometimes delivered with great
   point and power, and could not do otherwise than offend those who
   tenaciously held the sentiments which he opposed. That the indulgence
   of this spirit of controversy had an unfavorable bearing some times
   upon the tranquillity of his mind I think was evident; and hence he
   affords an example of the danger to be apprehended from carrying on a
   theological warfare on doctrinal points, lest it contract the heart,
   and degenerate into a querulous disposition respecting points of more
   minor importance than those which first awakened the Spirit of
   discussion.

   This, together with the many bodily infirmities which brother Crowell
   suffered toward the close of his life, no doubt, at times, interrupted
   that sweet flow of brotherly affection which binds the hearts of
   brethren together in the bundle of life, and leads to that reciprocity
   of those kindlier feelings which render social intercourse so agreeable
   and edifying.

   He has, however, gone to his rest. He lingered for several months under
   a slowly wasting disease, during which patience and resignation were
   exemplified in an eminent degree, and his soul was buoyed up with the
   blissful prospect of entering into life eternal. He left behind him
   many warm and admiring friends who had been profited by his ministry.
   If he had enemies he forgave them; nor could they suffer their
   disaffection to follow him beyond the tomb. The grace of God in Christ
   at last gave him a victory over the sting of death, and transmitted his
   soul to the regions of the just. And whatever infirmities may have
   occasionally eclipsed the glory of his character, human sympathy ceases
   to weep over them in view of the many excellences which beautified his
   mind, inspired as they were by that grace which carried him through the
   storms of life safely to the harbor of eternal rest. Nor will this
   record be misinterpreted by those who were acquainted with the intimate
   relation sometimes subsisting between the writer and his deceased
   friend; while to others it is enough to say, that death not only
   dissolved all earthly ties, but was also a period of cementing that
   union of spirit which, it is humbly hoped, will be more fully
   consummated in the kingdom of glory and of God.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This Year: 327,932; Last Year: 309,550;
   Increase: 18,382 -- Colored This Year: 54,065; Last Year: 51,334;
   Increase: 2,731 -- Total This Year: 381,997; Last Year: 360,884 --
   Increase: 21,113 -- Preachers This Year: 1,576; Last Year: 1,406;
   Increase: 170.

   Among the colored members above enumerated are included five hundred
   and twenty-three Indians, all in Upper Canada except one; but there
   were many more converted Indians than are here reported. It seems that
   at this time the conferences were not in the habit generally of
   returning the number of Indian converts separately in the Minutes; and
   as the reports of the Missionary Society were all consumed in the
   disastrous fire of the Book Concern in 1836, it is not now possible to
   ascertain their exact number at that time.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [20] In the reception of Mr. Summerfield the New York conference
   recognized the principle, that the regulations of Methodism in one part
   of the world are to be respected in every other part. According to a
   rule of the English and Irish conferences, a preacher remains on trial
   four years before he is admitted into full connection; but in the
   United States his probation ends with two years, when he is eligible to
   be admitted and ordained a deacon. Mr. Summerfield had traveled three
   years on trial in the Irish conference, and of course had but one year
   more to complete his probation; he was accordingly received by the New
   York conference as having but one year more to serve as a preacher on
   trial. Hence in 1822 he was admitted into full connection and ordained
   a deacon, according to the usages of our Church. And in 1824, having
   served two years as a deacon with fidelity and success, he was elected
   and ordained an elder.

   [21] See Methodist Magazine for 1828, p.349.

   [22] So it is stated in the published account of his life; but it is
   believed he must have been born somewhat earlier.

   [23] The reason of this decrease of colored members is, that that they
   had joined the secession which has been before noticed.

   [24] It is much regretted that the day and year of his birth, and his
   age at the time of his death, are not given in his memoir.

   After the organization of the conference the following address was
   received from the bishops, and referred to appropriate committees: --

   "Dear Brethren: -- It is our bounden duty to join in devout and
   grateful acknowledgments to the Father of mercies, whose gracious
   providence has preserved us in all our ways, and especially through the
   toils and dangers which have attended our journey from different and
   distant parts of the United States to this place. And while we
   acknowledge with gratitude the past interpositions of divine agency,
   let us unite in humble and fervent prayer for the influence of the Holy
   Spirit to guide us in all our deliberations, and to preserve us and the
   whole Church in the unity of the Spirit and in the bonds of peace.

   "During the last four years it has pleased the great Head of the church
   to continue his heavenly benediction on our Zion. The work has been
   greatly extended; many new circuits and districts have been formed in
   different parts of our vast field of labor; but yet there is room, and
   pressing calls for much greater enlargement are constantly made.

   "The great and extensive revivals of religion which we have experienced
   the last three years through almost every part of the work, furnish
   additional proof that God's design in raising up the preachers called
   Methodists, in America, was to reform the continent, and 'spread
   Scripture holiness over these lands.' These revivals have been the
   nurseries of the Church and of the ministry.

   "Perhaps it deserves to be regarded as an extraordinary interposition
   of the divine mercy in behalf of the Church, that the year ending with
   this date has been peculiarly distinguished by the abundant outpourings
   of the Holy Spirit, and the increase both in the ministry and
   membership.

   "While we are fully persuaded that, under God, our itinerant system has
   been the most effectual means of carrying on this great and blessed
   work, we recommend it to you to guard against whatever measures may
   have a tendency to weaken the energies of this system, or to locality
   in any department of the traveling ministry.

   "Our missionary work has been greatly increased since the last session
   of the General Conference. Many parts of our extensive frontiers and
   newly acquired territories have received the gospel of salvation by the
   labors of missionaries. The importance and necessity of maintaining
   this efficient missionary system are sufficiently demonstrated by the
   blessed effects which it has produced. vast regions of country, almost
   entirely destitute of the gospel ministry, have by this means, and at a
   small expense from the missionary funds, been formed into circuits, and
   embraced in our regular work.

   "Missions have been established in several Indian nations, most of
   which have succeeded beyond our highest expectations. And although, in
   some cases, we have had much to discourage us, and many difficulties to
   encounter and overcome in the prosecution of this work, we consider it
   of indispensable obligation to continue our efforts with increasing
   interest, for the salvation of this forlorn and afflicted people.

   "Our attention has been called to South America, and to the American
   colony and surrounding nations in Africa. But hitherto we have not been
   able to send missionaries to either place.

   "We invite the attention of the General Conference to this important
   subject. And while we cannot but regard the Missionary Society of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church as a very efficient auxiliary to our
   itinerant system, and happily calculated to diffuse the blessings of
   the gospel among the poor and destitute, we recommend it as a subject
   of inquiry whether it be necessary to adopt any further measures to
   render this important institution more extensive and harmonious in its
   membership, and more abundant and permanent in its resources; and if
   any, what measures will be best calculated to promote these desirable
   ends.

   "Since the last session of this body, the Sunday School Union and Tract
   Societies of the Methodist Episcopal Church have assumed an important
   and interesting character, and appear to promise great and lasting
   benefits to the community in general, and to the rising generation in
   particular. Your wisdom will dictate wherein it is necessary to give
   any additional direction and support to these benevolent and growing
   institutions.

   "As the right of all the members of the Methodist Episcopal Church to
   trial and appeal, as prescribed in the form of Discipline, is sacredly
   secured by the acts of the General Conference of 1808, it may not be
   improper to institute an inquiry, at the present session, whether any
   rule in the Discipline may be construed or applied so as to militate
   against suck acts; and if so, remedy the evil.

   "We invite your attention to a careful examination of the
   administration of the government, to see if it has been in accordance
   with the strictness and purity of our system.

   "Through a combination of circumstances, we have failed to comply with
   the instructions of the last General Conference relative to the
   appointment of a delegate to the British conference. We deeply regret
   this failure. And it would be far more afflictive were we not assured
   that it has not been occasioned, in the least degree, by any want of
   affection and respect for our British brethren, or any indisposition to
   continue that medium of intercourse with them. We therefore recommend
   it to you to supply our lack of service by appointing, in such a manner
   as you shall judge proper, a representative and messenger to visit the
   British conference at its next session.

   "May the God of peace be with you, and with the Church of our Lord
   Jesus Christ committed to your care.

   "Yours with affection and esteem in the bonds of the gospel."

   There were several important matters which came up for adjudication
   before this conference, affecting both the doctrines and government of
   the Church, as well as the character of some individuals. The first --
   that which affected the doctrines of the Church -- was presented in an
   appeal, by the Rev. Joshua Randell, from a decision of the New England
   conference, by which he had been expelled for holding and propagating
   doctrines inconsistent with our acknowledged standards
    1. In denying that the transgressions of the law, to which we are
       personally responsible, have had any atonement made for them by
       Christ.
    2. Maintaining that the infinite claims of justice upon the
       transgressor of the divine law may, upon the condition of the mere
       acts of the transgressor himself, be relinquished and given up, and
       the transgressor pardoned without an atonement."

   On these two specifications, both of which the defendant acknowledged
   that he held, the New England conference had first suspended him, and
   given him one year to reflect, and, if convinced of his error, to
   retract; and then, on finding that, at the end of the year, he
   persisted in his belief in these two propositions, and had endeavored
   to sustain them, both from the pulpit and the press, they had expelled
   him from the Church. From this solemn decision he had appealed to this
   General Conference, where he appeared in his own defense, and was
   allowed to vindicate his views to his entire satisfaction, it being
   stated in the journal of the General Conference that "he considered the
   case as having been fairly represented, and that he had nothing in
   particular to add."

   The respondent to Mr. Randell, on behalf of the New England conference,
   was the Rev. Wilbur Fisk, whose able argument carried a full conviction
   to the judgments of all, with one solitary exception, that the above
   propositions contained doctrines adverse to the doctrines of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, and that the proceedings of the New England
   conference on the case had been legal and orderly. After a full, and,
   as was acknowledged by the defendant himself, an impartial examination
   and hearing of the case, the decree of the New England conference was
   affirmed by a vote of one hundred and sixty-four out of one hundred and
   sixty-five who were present and voted on the question, two members, at
   their own request, being excused from voting either way.

   It appears that Bishop Hedding had been misrepresented in a paper
   published by the Reformers, called "Mutual Rights." [26] This arose out
   of an address which he delivered to the Pittsburgh conference, in
   Washington, Pa., August 22d, 1826, on the duty of its members in
   reference to the discussions with which some portions of the Church
   were then much agitated on the subject of a church reform, then in
   contemplation by a number of individuals. This address, which gave
   offense to those who were in favor of the proposed measures of the
   "Reformers," so called, had been reported by one of the members of said
   conference, in the "Mutual Rights," and sentiments imputed to Bishop
   Hedding which he disavowed, as injurious to his character. He had
   accordingly written to the "Mutual Rights," contradicting the
   slanderous misrepresentation, and demanding reparation. This not being
   satisfactorily done by the offending brother, the bishop felt it to be
   his duty to present the subject to this General Conference, and to
   request that it might be investigated; and hence the whole affair was
   referred to the committee on the episcopacy, before whom the bishop,
   the writer of the offensive article, and the delegates of the
   Pittsburgh conference appeared; and after a full examination of the
   entire subject, they came to the following conclusion: That, after an
   interview with the person who wrote the article in the "Mutual Rights,"
   and the delegates of the Pittsburgh conference, in whose presence the
   bishop had delivered the address respecting which the offensive article
   had been written, and hearing all that could be said by the parties
   concerned, it was believed that the writer had injuriously
   misrepresented Bishop Hedding in what he had published. This the writer
   himself; after hearing the explanations of the bishop, frankly
   acknowledged, and acquiesced in the decision of the committee
   respecting its injustice, and the propriety of making reparation by
   publishing the report of the committee, which report concludes in these
   words: -- "That the address of Bishop Hedding, as recollected by
   himself and the delegates of the Pittsburgh annual conference, not only
   was not deserving of censure, but such as the circumstances of the case
   rendered it his official duty to deliver."

   As an act of justice to Bishop Hedding, the entire report, as adopted
   by the conference, was published in the Christian Advocate and Journal,
   and may be seen in that paper for May 30, 1828.

   Another subject of a more general character, and of no little
   importance, came up for consideration before this conference. We have
   already seen that the Canada brethren had manifested much
   dissatisfaction on account of the relation which they sustained to us,
   and the desire they had manifested at times to become independent. This
   desire, however, did not arise out of any dissatisfaction with the
   conduct of the brethren in the United States toward them, but chiefly
   from the opposition evinced by statesmen in Upper Canada to their being
   subject to the control of a foreign ecclesiastical head, over which the
   civil authorities of Canada could exercise no jurisdiction; and as most
   of the preachers in Canada were formerly from the United States, and
   all of them subject to an ecclesiastical jurisdiction in another
   nation, it was contended by the Canadian authorities that they had no
   sufficient guarantee for their allegiance to the crown of Great
   Britain, and to the civil regulations of Canada; and hence the
   Methodist ministers in Canada had suffered civil disabilities, and had
   not been allowed to celebrate the rites of matrimony, not even for
   their own members.

   These arguments, and others of a similar character, had induced the
   Canada conference, which assembled in Hallowell, in 1824, when Bishops
   George and Hedding were both with them, to memorialize the several
   annual conferences in the United States on the subject of establishing
   an independent church in Upper Canada, requesting them to recommend the
   measure to this General Conference. Accordingly, the subject came up at
   this time by a memorial from the Canada conference, which was presented
   by its delegates, and referred to a committee.

   The deliberations of the conference resulted in the adoption of the
   following preamble and report: --

   "Whereas the Canada annual conference, situated in the province of
   Upper Canada, under a foreign government, have, in their memorial,
   presented to this conference the disabilities under which they labor,
   in consequence of their union with a foreign ecclesiastical government,
   and setting forth their desire to be set off as a separate church
   establishment: and whereas this General Conference disclaim all right
   to exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction under such circumstances,
   except by mutual agreement: --
    1. Resolved, therefore, by the delegates of the annual conferences in
       General Conference assembled, that the compact existing between the
       Canada annual conference and the Methodist Episcopal Church in the
       United States be, and hereby is, dissolved by mutual consent.
    2. That our superintendents or superintendent be, and hereby are,
       respectfully advised and requested to ordain such person as may be
       elected by the Canada conference a superintendent for the Canada
       connection.
    3. That we do hereby recommend to our brethren in Canada to adopt the
       form of government of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United
       States, with such modifications as their particular relations shall
       render necessary.
    4. That we do hereby express to our Canada brethren our sincere desire
       that the most friendly feeling may exist between them and the
       connection of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States.
    5. That the claims of the Canada conference on our Book Concern and
       chartered fund, and any other claims they may suppose they justly
       have, shall be left open for the negotiation and adjustment between
       the two connections."

   It was afterward resolved that the managers of our Missionary Society
   should he allowed to appropriate the sum of seven hundred dollars
   annually for the support of the Indian missions in Upper Canada.

   There is an important principle involved in the above agreement to
   dissolve the connection which had so long subsisted between the
   Methodists in the United States and Upper Canada, which it seems
   expedient to explain. When the subject first came up for consideration
   it was contended, and the committee to whom it was first referred so
   reported, which report was approved of by a vote of the General
   Conference, that we had no constitutional right to set off the brethren
   in Upper Canada as an independent body, because the terms of the
   compact by which we existed as a General Conference made it obligatory
   on us, as a delegated body, to preserve the union entire, and not to
   break up the Church into separate fragments. Hence, to grant the prayer
   of the memorialists, by a solemn act of legislation, would be giving
   sanction to a principle, and setting a precedent for future General
   Conferences, of a dangerous character -- of such a character as might
   tend ultimately to the dissolution of the ecclesiastical body, which
   would be, in fact and form, contravening the very object for which we
   were constituted a delegated conference, this object being a
   preservation, and not a destruction or dissolution of the union. These
   arguments appeared so forcible to the first committee, and to the
   conference, that the idea of granting them a separate organization on
   the principle of abstract and independent legislation was abandoned as
   altogether indefensible, being contrary to the constitutional compact.

   But still feeling a desire to grant, in some way, that which the Canada
   brethren so earnestly requested, and for which they pleaded with much
   zeal, and even with most pathetic appeals to our sympathies, it was
   suggested by a very intelligent member of the General Conference, the
   late Bishop Emory, that the preachers who went to Canada from the
   United States went in the first instance as missionaries, and that ever
   afterward, whenever additional help was needed, Bishop Asbury and his
   successors asked for volunteers, not claiming the right to send them,
   in the same authoritative manner in which they were sent to the
   different parts of the United States and territories; hence it followed
   that the compact between us and our brethren in Canada was altogether
   of a voluntary character -- we had offered them our services, and they
   had accepted them and therefore, as the time had arrived when they were
   no longer willing to receive or accept of our labors and
   superintendence, they had a perfect right to request us to withdraw our
   services, and we the same right to withhold them.

   This presented the subject in a new and very clear light, and it seemed
   perfectly compatible with our powers as a delegated conference, and
   their privileges as a part of the same body, thus connected by a
   voluntary and conditional compact, either expressed or implied, to
   dissolve the connection subsisting between us, without any dereliction
   of duty or forfeiture of privilege on either part. It was on this
   principle alone that the above agreement was based.

   It will be perceived, therefore, that this mutual agreement to dissolve
   the connection heretofore subsisting between the Methodist Episcopal
   Church in the United States and the Canada conference cannot, with
   justice, be pleaded for setting off any one conference or any number of
   annual conferences in the United States, as their relations to each
   other and to the General Conference are quite dissimilar to that which
   bound the Canada conference to us. The conferences in the United States
   are all bound together by one sacred compact, and the severing any one
   from the main body would partake of the same suicidal character as to
   sever a sound limb from the body. The General Conference has no right,
   no authority, thus "to scatter, tear, and slay" the body which they are
   solemnly bound to keep together, to nourish, to protect, and to
   preserve in one harmonious whole. If an annual conference declare
   itself independent, out of the pale of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   it is its own act exclusively, and therefore the responsibility rests
   upon itself alone, for which the General Conference cannot be held
   accountable, because it was not a participant in the separation. I do
   not say that the General Conference may not disown an annual
   conference, should it become corrupt in doctrine, in moral discipline,
   or in religious practice. Should, for instance, an annual conference,
   by an act of the majority of its members, abjure any of our essential
   doctrines, such as the atonement of Christ, or justification by faith,
   or should renounce the sacrament of baptism or the Lord's supper, or
   strike from its moral code any of the precepts of morality recognized
   in our general rules, it might become the duty of the General
   Conference to interpose its high authority, and cut off; or at least to
   withdraw its fellowship from, the offending members. Yet such an act of
   excision, or of disnaturalization, if I may so call it, could be
   justified only as a dernier resort, when all other means had failed to
   reclaim the delinquents from their wanderings-just as the surgeon's
   knife is to be withheld until mortification endangers the life of the
   patient, when death or amputation becomes the sole alternative. How
   else can the Church be preserved-supposing such a case of delinquency
   to exist -- from a general putrefaction? For if a majority of an annual
   conference become heterodox in doctrine, or morally corrupt in
   practice, the minority cannot control them, cannot call them to an
   account, condemn, and expel them. And in this case, must the majority
   of the annual conferences, and perhaps also a respectable minority of
   that very annual conference, be compelled to hold these apostates from
   truth and righteousness in the bosom of their fellowship, to treat them
   in all respects as brethren beloved, and publicly to recognize them as
   such in their public and authorized documents? This would be a hard
   case indeed! an alternative to which no ecclesiastical body should be
   compelled to submit.

   These remarks are made to prevent any misconception respecting the
   principle on which the above connection was dissolved, and to show that
   it forms no precedent for a dissolution of the connection now
   subsisting between the annual and General Conferences in the United
   States. Analogical arguments, to he conclusive, must be drawn from
   analogous facts or circumstances, and not from contrast, or opposing
   facts or circumstances. And the relation subsisting between the annual
   conferences in the United States to each other, and between them and
   the General Conference, stands in contrast with the relation which did
   subsist between the Canada and the General Conference; and therefore no
   analogical argument can be drawn from the mutual agreement by which
   this relation was dissolved in favor of dissolving the connection now
   subsisting between the annual conferences in the United States, by a
   solemn act of legislation on the part of the General Conference, except
   for the reasons above assigned; and those reasons, let it be
   remembered, make the contrast still greater between the two acts, and
   justify the difference of the procedure; for the dissolution of the
   compact between us and the Canada brethren from the jurisdiction only,
   Christian fellowship still subsisting -- while the supposed act of
   excision would be a withdrawing of Christian fellowship from the
   offending members.

   There were also other great principles of ecclesiastical economy
   involved in the above resolutions, which it may be well to develop and
   dwell upon for a moment.

   It has been seen that the General Conference authorized our bishops, or
   any one of them, to ordain a bishop for Upper Canada. It was also
   provided that if such bishop should be so ordained his episcopal
   jurisdiction should be limited to Canada -- that he should not be
   allowed to exercise his functions in the United States. In favor of
   both of these positions, namely, the ordaining a bishop for Canada, and
   then restricting him in his episcopal functions to that country, or the
   not allowing him to exercise them in the United States, the following
   precedents were adduced

   It was pleaded that the bishops of England ordained bishops for the
   United States exclusively: that when Wesley and others ordained Dr.
   Coke, it was only for the United States: and hence neither of these
   functionaries was allowed to exercise his episcopal powers in Great
   Britain. Here, then, were precedents, from our own and another church,
   both for consecrating men for other countries, and for restricting
   them, in the exercise of their official duties, to the countries for
   which they were designated in their certificates of ordination. It was
   furthermore stated -- and truly too -- that when it was contemplated to
   consecrate the late Rev. Freeborn Garrettson a bishop for Nova Scotia
   and the West Indies, it was proposed to withhold from him the privilege
   of being a bishop, by virtue of that election and consecration, in the
   United States.

   And as to ordaining men for foreign countries, on special occasions,
   church history was full of examples, all which might be adduced as
   sound precedents for the authority conferred upon our bishops in regard
   to ordaining a man on whom the choice of the Canada conference might
   fall for their superintendent.

   There was one other subject disposed of at this conference, more
   important, in many respects, than either of those already mentioned,
   inasmuch as it involved principles and measures which must, had they
   been carried into effect, have produced a radical change in both the
   legislative and executive departments of our church government, and
   were therefore considered revolutionary in their character and
   tendency.

   That this subject may be placed in such a point of light as to be
   clearly understood, it is necessary to enter into some historical
   details.

   We have already seen that there had been considerable uneasiness
   manifested in some portions of our Church on the subject of a lay
   representation in the General Conference. At first the discussions upon
   this subject were confined to private circles, though some of the
   traveling and more of the local preachers, as well as a few of the lay
   members, had been and were now of the opinion that such a
   representation ought to be granted. At length, however, those who were
   most zealous for this measure commenced a periodical publication,
   called the "Wesleyan Repository," in which they began, at first with
   apparent moderation, to discuss the principle of lay representation.
   The headquarters of this publication, which was commenced in 1820, were
   Trenton, in the state of New Jersey; and though its editor was known,
   the greater portion of its writers appeared under the mask of
   fictitious signatures, by which they eluded individual responsibility.
   The strictures upon our church government, which became uncommonly
   severe, were more calculated to irritate the passions than to convince
   the judgment, and they soon degenerated into personal attacks, in which
   some of our bishops and chief ministers were dragged before the public
   in a way to injure their character, and consequently to circumscribe
   their usefulness. And though we had a monthly periodical, it was
   thought, by the most judicious among our ministers and people, that its
   columns ought not to be occupied with such a thriftless controversy,
   much less as the writers in the Repository lay concealed beneath
   fictitious signatures; and moreover, instead of sober argument, they
   frequently resorted to biting sarcasm, to personal criminations, and to
   a caricature of some of those institutions which we, as a church, had
   long held sacred. Though it was believed that most of the writers in
   the Repository were local preachers and laymen, yet it was known that
   several of the traveling preachers themselves were favorable to the
   proposed innovation, and therefore lent the weight of their influence
   in its behalf by writing occasionally for its columns.

   With a view to concentrate their strength and harmonize their views as
   much as possible, the friends of the innovating measures formed a
   "Union Society" in the city of Baltimore, elected officers and a
   committee of correspondence, inviting all who were with them in
   sentiment to form auxiliary societies throughout the country, that
   there might be a general cooperation among the advocates of lay
   representation.

   Things went on in this way until near the meeting of the General
   Conference in 1824, when the male members of the Church in the city of
   Baltimore, which had now become the center of operations for the
   "Reformers," with a view to allay, if possible, the heat of party
   spirit, were called together for the purpose of attempting to effect a
   compromise. This effort grew out of the fact that there were many
   conflicting opinions among those who were favorable to "reform," and a
   strong desire among the warm friends of the Church to avert the
   calamities of a separation, which they saw must inevitably result from
   this feverish excitement, unless some pacific measures could be adopted
   to cool it down. In this meeting it was proposed, as the basis of the
   compromise, to memorialize the General Conference on the subject of a
   lay delegation, provided the question of a right to such representation
   were waived, and the privilege should be asked on the ground of
   expediency alone. This was assented to by the leading men among the
   "Reformers," and a memorial was accordingly prepared in accordance with
   these views, the part relating to lay representation being expressed in
   the following words

   "Under these views we have been led to turn our attention to the
   subject of a lay delegation to the General Conference. In presenting
   this subject to your consideration, we would waive all that might be
   urged on the natural or abstract right of the membership to this
   privilege. We are content to admit that all governments, whether civil
   or ecclesiastical, ought to be founded, not on considerations growing
   out of abstract rights, but on expediency, that being always the right
   government which best secures the interests of the whole community.
   With regard to the expediency of the measure, then, we may urge that
   such a delegation would bring into the conference much information with
   regard to the temporal affairs of the Church which the ministry cannot
   well be supposed to possess. They would feel less delicacy in
   originating and proposing measures for the relief of the preachers'
   families than the preachers themselves, as they could not be subjected
   thereby to the imputation of interested motives, and they would, by
   being distributed everywhere among the membership, and, by their
   personal exertions and influence, the success of such measures. and
   awaken, more generally than has hitherto been done, the attention of
   the Methodist community to the great interests of the Church.

   "We are aware of the constitutional objections to this change in our
   economy. We know that you are clearly prohibited, by the very first
   article of the constitution under which you act, from adding to the
   conference any delegation not provided for in that rule; but we believe
   that an Opinion expressed by the conference, and approved by the
   episcopacy, would induce the annual conferences to make the necessary
   alteration in the constitution: and we submit the consideration of the
   whole matter to the calm and deliberate attention which we are
   persuaded its importance demands, and which we do not doubt it will
   receive, determined cheerfully and cordially to submit to your
   decision."

   During the session of the conference in May, 1824, some of the
   "Reformers," becoming dissatisfied with the principles of the
   compromise, formed a separate society, and claimed a representation in
   the General Conference as a natural and social right, deprecating its
   rejection by the General Conference as an evidence of a spiritual
   despotism utterly unworthy the character of the ministry of Jesus
   Christ. To effect their objects with the greater certainty, they
   immediately issued proposals for establishing a new periodical, called
   "Mutual Rights," its title being well calculated to impress the unwary
   reader with the erroneous idea, so much harped upon in those days of
   agitation, that the "Reformers" were the exclusive advocates of the
   "rights" of the lay members of our Church.

   The formation of these societies, and the publication of this
   periodical, in which most inflammatory declamations were poured forth
   against our ministry and established usages, were considered, by the
   more sober and thinking part of our community, as incorporating the
   very schism in the Church which they deprecated as one of the worst
   evils with which it could be afflicted, except, indeed, its inundation
   by immorality. The fate, however, of those measures, so far as the
   General Conference was concerned, has been seen in the account given of
   the doings of the General Conference in 1824. The prayer of the
   memorialists was rejected, and the ground of right to a lay
   representation denied.

   It is not necessary to trace the history of this unpleasant affair, in
   all its minutiae and various ramifications over different parts of the
   country, from that time until the secession was fully consummated, and
   a separate community established. Suffice it therefore to say, that
   matters went on from bad to worse, until it became necessary, in the
   opinion of those who watched over the Church in Baltimore, to save it
   and its institutions from dissolution, to call the malcontents to an
   account for their conduct.

   At the Baltimore conference, in 1827, the Rev. D. B. Dorsey, who had
   connected himself with the "Reformers," was arraigned before his
   conference for recommending and circulating the "Mutual Rights;" and
   during the course of his trial he avowed such principles, and made such
   declarations respecting his independent rights, as could not be
   approved of by the conference; and they therefore requested, as the
   mildest punishment they could inflict, the bishop to leave him without
   an' appointment for one year. From this decision be took an appeal to
   the General Conference; but, instead of waiting patiently until this
   ultimate decision could he had, he loudly censured the acts of the
   Baltimore conference in reference to his case, through the columns of
   "Mutual Rights," thus appealing from the constituted authorities of the
   Church to the popular voice, invoking from this very equivocal tribunal
   a decision in his favor. All this had a tendency to widen the breach,
   and to make a reconciliation the more hopeless.

   One of the leading champions of this "reform" was the Rev. Nicholas
   Snethen, who had been a very useful and influential traveling preacher
   for many years, but was now located, and lived in the neighborhood of
   Baltimore. He was recognized as the writer of several articles, under
   fictitious signatures, in the "Wesleyan Repository" and "Mutual
   Rights," in which severe strictures were made upon our economy; and
   now, since action had commenced against the malcontents in the
   Baltimore conference, by which it was foreseen that others, implicated
   in the same warfare against the authorities and usages of the Church,
   would be called to answer for their conduct, Mr. Snethen avowed himself
   the author of these pieces, vauntingly placed himself in front of the
   reforming ranks, shouting, "Onward! brethren; onward!" pledging himself
   to suffer or triumph with them-thus exhibiting a spirit of moral
   heroism worthy of a better cause, and more befitting other times than
   those which called only for a bloodless warfare.

   This conduct, however, brought forth a champion from the ranks of the
   local preachers, who, as he himself acknowledged, had been friendly to
   some slight changes in the structure of our church government, provided
   such changes should be thought expedient by the General Conference, and
   could be effected by pacific measures, without producing a convulsion
   in the body. He had long been an intimate and personal friend of Mr.
   Snethen, and therefore it was with some reluctance that he yielded to
   the paramount duty of sacrificing his personal friendship for the
   purpose of defending the "ancient landmarks," and of placing himself in
   opposition to the innovations in contemplation by the "Reformers." I
   allude to Doctor Thomas E. Bond, of Baltimore. In 1827 he published his
   "Appeal to the Methodists, in Opposition to the Changes proposed in
   their Church Government," which was prefaced by an epistolary
   dedication to the Rev. Nicholas Snethen. This appeared to take Mr.
   Snethen and his friends by surprise, as they seemed to expect least of
   all such an appeal from the source whence it came, while it acted as a
   charm upon the minds of those who loved the institutions and prayed for
   the perpetual union and prosperity of the Church. The able manner in
   which Dr. Bond treated the subject, and refuted the arguments and
   exposed the pretensions of the "Reformers," showed that he had
   thoroughly digested the questions at issue, had "counted the cost," and
   was prepared to abide the results of the contest. Having, therefore,
   balanced the weight of the arguments for and against the proposed
   innovation, and fully made up a judgment in favor of the Church and its
   institutions, he wrote from the fullness of his heart, and the
   following passage from his "Appeal" will show the confident manner in
   which he anticipated the result of this severe and long-protracted
   struggle. After giving the outlines of our church government, and the
   general system of itinerant operations, he introduces the following
   spirited remarks

   "It is this system of church government, so simple in its structure and
   efficient in its operation, so tested by experience and justified by
   success, and, withal, so sanctified in the feelings and affections of
   our people by the endearing associations with which it stands
   connected, that we are now called upon, not to modify, but radically to
   change; not to mend in some of its less important details, but to alter
   in its fundamental principles, and to substitute for it a speculative
   scheme of government, inapplicable to our circumstances, and therefore
   impossible to be effected; -- a scheme founded on abstract notions of
   natural rights, but which none of its advocates have attempted to
   exhibit in any visible or tangible shape or form, and therefore they
   have carefully avoided the discussion of the parts most important in
   any system, namely, its practicability and expediency. Happy for us,
   the scheme is not new. In Europe it has had its day of noise and
   strife, and has ceased to agitate the Church; and in this country Mr.
   O'Kelly started it more than thirty years ago, left the Church, and
   drew off several of the preachers with him. He lived to see the ruins
   of the visionary fabric he had labored to erect, and to mourn over the
   desolation which he had brought upon that part of the vineyard, where,
   as a Methodist preacher, he so faithfully and usefully labored, but
   which he had afterward turned out to be ravaged and destroyed by
   "republican Methodism." The formidable phalanx now arrayed against us
   may, it is feared, do us much harm, but we will take protection under
   that strong Arm which has heretofore defended us. Hitherto our history
   has shown that the great Head of the church had appointed us for a
   special work in his vineyard, and that he superintended and directed
   the labor, opening the way before our ministry, qualifying and
   sustaining them in their arduous labors, under circumstances which
   would have discouraged any but such as were assured of divine support,
   and who were prepared to believe in hope against hope. Great conflicts
   await us, but out of all the Lord will deliver us: while he is with us,
   the more we are oppressed, the more we shall multiply and grow. Let us
   be faithful to our calling -- let us watch unto prayer. The present
   revolutionary scheme of our disaffected members will share the fate of
   all the similar projects which have preceded it. Our children will read
   of it in history, but, ere they take our places in the Church, the
   troubled waters shall have heard the voice of Him who says to the winds
   and the waves, Be still, and they obey his voice."

   This strong appeal, written throughout with a spirit and a style of
   argument which did honor to the head and heart of its author, exerted a
   most salutary influence upon all who had not fully committed themselves
   to the principles and measures of the "Reformers." While it drew the
   lines more distinctly which divided the contending parties, it tended
   to cement closer together those who had so long cherished the
   institutions of Methodism, and to arm them with weapons of defense.
   Hitherto there had been some neutralists, who were looking on, not
   indeed with cold indifference, but with an anxious suspense, watching
   the result of the movements, and weighing the respective arguments, for
   the purpose of forming an intelligent decision. These acknowledged
   themselves much indebted to Dr. Bond for throwing additional light upon
   this subject, and thus saving them from lapsing into the sickly spirit
   of "reform:" and the Appeal doubtless had the greater weight for having
   been issued from the local instead of the traveling ministry, because
   it was supposed that the former had identified themselves more
   generally than the latter with the reforming party.

   In the mean time a pamphlet had been issued, as was erroneously
   supposed at the time under the sanction of the Union Society, by Rev.
   Alexander McCaine, [27] in which he attempted to prove that
   surreptitious means had been used in the establishment of our Church;
   that our episcopacy was spurious, gotten lip against the wishes and
   without the knowledge of Mr. Wesley thus impugning the motives and
   impeaching the honesty of such men as Coke, Asbury, Whatcoat, and all
   those venerable men who composed the General Conference of 1784, and
   assisted in the organization of our Church. This appeared to be the
   climax of absurdities in the doings of the adverse party, and to reveal
   designs upon the integrity and the very existence of our episcopacy,
   and all those regulations and usages which connected themselves with
   that feature of our Church economy, which could not be any longer
   tolerated with impunity. It was therefore thought, by the friends of
   order and the advocates of our Church authorities, that the time had
   fully come for action -- for such action as should test the solidity of
   our ecclesiastical structure, and the permanency of its foundation.

   Indeed, these ungenerous attacks upon the best of men, most of whom
   were now dead, and therefore could not speak for themselves, aroused
   the spirits of those who had hitherto stood aloof from this
   controversy, and decided some who had been supposed to be friendly to
   the spirit of "reform" against the measure, inasmuch as they judged --
   most conclusively, it is thought -- that a cause which could enlist in
   its behalf such unjustifiable means of attack and defense, could not be
   holy and good. This brought forth the late Bishop Emory, who was at
   that time an assistant book agent; and the Defense of our Fathers"
   proved his competency to defend those venerable men from the aspersions
   thrown upon them by the author of the "History and Mystery of Methodist
   Episcopacy." This masterly defense of the men who organized our Church,
   and of he organization itself, its principles, measures, and results,
   procured for its author that need of praise that is justly due to a
   faithful son of the Church, to an acute and able reasoner, and to one
   whose industry in collecting and arranging facts for the basis of his
   argumentation evinced the depth and accuracy of his research. This
   production was therefore hailed with delight by the friends of the
   Church, and tended, with some others of a similar character, published
   about the same time, to prove that the theory of the "Reformers" was a
   visionary scheme, indefensible by any arguments drawn from Scripture,
   from the ancient records of the Church, from the analogy of things, or
   from any improper means used in either the organization or naming of
   the Methodist Episcopal Church. This complete refutation of the
   groundless assumptions of Mr. McCaine's book was read with great
   avidity, and procured for its author the thanks of all who wished well
   to our Zion.

   But while these things tended to calm the fears of the timid, to
   confirm the wavering in the truth, and to strengthen the hearts of all
   who had heretofore reposed in the wisdom and integrity of our fathers
   in the gospel, they by no means satisfied those who appeared bent on
   carrying their measures at all hazards. On the contrary, their leaders
   seemed to struggle hard under disappointment, and to redouble their
   efforts in rallying their forces, and preparing them for victory or
   defeat, whenever the warfare should terminate. They had heretofore most
   evidently calculated on carrying with them many who now took a decided
   stand against them. This was a source of severe disappointment. [28]
   These showed, when the alternative was presented to their choice, that
   they loved Methodism better than its proposed substitute. The former
   they had tried, and found savory and healthful; the latter was an
   untried experiment, and judging from the fruit it had already produced,
   that it was not "good to make one wise, they declined the proffered
   boon as unworthy of their acceptance.

   But, as before remarked, things had arrived at such a crisis in the
   city of Baltimore that it became necessary, in the opinion of those to
   whom the oversight of the Church was committed, to call some of the
   most prominent lenders in the work of "reform" to an account before the
   proper tribunals. Hence eleven local preachers and twenty-five lay
   members were regularly cited to appear before the preacher in charge of
   the Baltimore station, the Rev. James M. Hanson, to answer to the
   charge of "inveighing against our Discipline," "speaking evil of our
   ministers," and of violating the rule "which prohibits the members of
   the Church from doing harm, and requires them to avoid evil of every
   kind."

   This general charge was amply sustained by a reference to the
   Constitution of the Union Society, by numerous quotations from "Mutual
   Rights," and from other sources. The delinquents were therefore found
   guilty, the local preachers were suspended, and the lay members
   expelled. While, however, these transactions were pending, before any
   decision was had, Dr. Bond once more threw himself in the gap, and
   endeavored to avert the suspended blow by acting the part of a mediator
   between the parties, and, if possible, thereby to prevent the storm
   from bursting on their heads. His efforts, however, were unavailing;
   the trials proceeded, and the penalty of the Discipline was finally
   inflicted, though with great reluctance, upon all those who had been
   summoned to trial, with the exception of two lay members.

   One of the specifications which was adduced to sustain the general
   charge was their advising and requesting the publication of the
   "History and Mystery of Methodist Episcopacy;" but as it was found, on
   further examination, that its author alone was responsible for writing
   and publishing that work, this specification was withdrawn in reference
   to all the accused except Alexander McCaine; and he therefore was
   summoned before another committee of local preachers, tried separately,
   found guilty, and accordingly suspended.

   As the district conference of local preachers had been dissolved, the
   trial of those who had been suspended by the committee of inquiry was
   brought before the quarterly meeting conference of the Baltimore
   station. But before the trial proceeded to an issue, Dr. J. C. Green,
   of Virginia, volunteered his services as a mediator between the
   parties, and the trial was postponed for the purpose of giving ample
   time to test the result of the negotiation. It was, however,
   unavailing, and the trial proceeded, and terminated in finding guilty,
   and the consequent expulsion, of the accused local preachers; and as
   they did not appeal, as they might, to the annual conference, they were
   finally considered no longer members of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

   To the lay members who had been found guilty before the act of
   expulsion was consummated, and with a view, if possible, to save
   himself and those concerned from the sad alternative which awaited
   them, Mr. Hanson sent each of the persons the following letter:--

   "Baltimore, Nov. 23,1827.

   "Brother: You are hereby informed that the committee appointed to
   investigate the charges and specifications lately preferred against you
   as a member of the Union Society, have, by a unanimous decision, found
   you guilty of said charges, together with the first and second
   specifications.

   "Most willingly, my brother, would I now dispense with the painful duty
   which devolves upon me, could I do so as an honest man, and without
   abandoning the interests of the Church. Or had I cause to believe that
   the course now about to be pursued would lead you to make suitable
   reparation to that Church whose ministers and discipline you have
   assailed and misrepresented, and to abstain from the like offenses
   against the peace and harmony of said Church in future, it would tend
   more than any other consideration to diminish the painfulness of the
   obligation which my present situation imposes upon me. For, be assured,
   whatever my own opinion may be in regard to the course you may have
   pursued, as a member of t Union society, I most devoutly wish and pray
   that you may be led by the good Spirit of God to take those steps which
   will leave you still in the possession of all the rights and privileges
   of church fellowship.

   "You must be considered as the arbiter of your own destiny, my brother,
   in this matter. Your brethren of the committee, men who fear God, whose
   characters stand fair in the Church, and who have disclaimed all
   feeling of personal hostility against you, have pronounced you, as a
   member of the Union society, guilty of endeavoring to sow dissensions
   in the society or Church of which you are a member, and of speaking
   evil of the ministers of said Church. To this conclusion they have been
   conducted by a careful and patient examination of the documents put
   into their hands as evidence in the case. You must, therefore, plainly
   perceive, that the only ground on which expulsion from the Church can
   be avoided is an abandonment of the Union Society, with assurances that
   you will give no aid in future to any publication or measure calculated
   to cast reproach upon our ministers, or occasion breach of union among
   our members.

   "Be good enough then, my brother, to answer in writing the following
   plain and simple questions: --
    1. Will you withdraw forthwith from the Union Society?
    2. Will you in future withhold your aid from such publications and
       measures as are calculated to cast reproach upon our ministers, and
       produce breach of union among our members?

   "Yours, &c. James M. Hanson.

   "P.S. Your answer will be expected in the course of four or five days."

   After allowing sufficient time for deliberation, and receiving no
   answer, nor discovering any symptoms of reconciliation from any
   quarter, Mr. Hanson was compelled to the act, so exceedingly painful to
   an administrator of discipline, of pronouncing them excommunicated from
   the Methodist Episcopal Church. Thus was the separation, so long and so
   painfully anticipated, notwithstanding all the means used to prevent
   it, finally consummated, and the Church left to bleed under the wounds
   afflicted upon her by those whom she had once delighted to honor.

   In the mean time similar proceedings were had in other places. We have
   already seen that the Union Society of Baltimore recommended that
   societies of the like character should be organized wherever a
   sufficient number of persons could be found friendly to the measures of
   the "Reformers." This recommendation had been complied with in a number
   of places; and wherever these societies existed, agitations and
   commotions, similar to those in Baltimore, had been the painful
   results. Hence, in the states of Tennessee and North Carolina, several
   members of these Union Societies had been tried and expelled from the
   Church for their refractory conduct, and for inveighing against the
   discipline and aspersing the character of the ministers of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church. And in addition to those eleven local
   preachers and twenty-two laymen who were expelled in Baltimore, about
   fifty females, friends of the excommunicated brethren, addressed a
   letter to the ruling preacher, Mr. Hanson, expressing their desire to
   withdraw from the Church, which they were permitted to do without
   further trial.

   It may be necessary here to correct an erroneous opinion, which
   prevailed to some extent at the time, respecting the cause of complaint
   against the "Reformers," as they chose all along to call themselves.

   Whoever will consult the writings of those days, in reference to this
   subject, will find complaints, on the part of the "Reformers," that an
   attempt was made, by the advocates for the present order of things, to
   suppress inquiry, to abridge the freedom of speech and of the press,
   and that these trials were instituted, in part at least, as a
   punishment for exercising this freedom on the subjects that were then
   litigated. This was a great mistake. It was for an abuse of this
   freedom, for indulging in personal criminations, injurious to
   individual character, that the delinquents were tried and finally
   condemned. This will appear manifest to every person who will
   impartially inspect the charges, the specifications, and the testimony
   selected from the "Mutual Rights" to support the accusations, and also
   from the report of the General Conference on petitions and memorials.
   It was, indeed, expressly is avowed at the time by the prosecutors, and
   by all who had written on the subject, that they wished to suppress
   freedom of inquiry, either in writing or speaking, provided only that
   the debaters would confine their discussions to an investigation of
   facts and arguments, without impeaching the character and motives of
   those from whom they dissented. [29]

   The expelled members in the city of Baltimore immediately formed
   themselves into a society, under the tide of "Associated Methodist
   Reformers;" and in the month of November, 1827 a convention assembled
   in that city, composed of ministers and lay delegates who had been
   elected by the state conventions and Union Societies. This convention
   prepared a memorial to the General Conference. The memorial was
   presented, read, and referred to a committee, and the following report,
   drawn up by the late Bishop Emory, and unanimously adopted by the
   conference, will show the result:

   "The committee to whom were referred certain petitions and memorials,
   for and against a direct lay and local representation in the General
   Conference, submit the following report: --

   "Of those which propose this revolution in our economy, that which has
   been received from a convention of certain local preachers and lay
   members, held in the city of Baltimore in November last, is presumed to
   embody the general views -- of those who desire this change, and the
   chief arguments on which they rely. In framing a reply, in the midst of
   the various and pressing business of a General Conference, it cannot be
   reasonably expected that we should enter into minute details. Our
   remarks, of necessity, must be confined to a few leading topics, in
   condensed, yet, we trust, an intelligible form.

   "As to the claim of right to the representation contended for, if it be
   a right which the claimants are entitled to demand, it must be either a
   natural or an acquired right. If a natural right, then, being founded
   in nature, it must be common to men, as men. The foundation of rights
   in ecclesiastical bodies, in our opinion, rests on a different basis.
   If it be alleged to be an acquired right, then it must have been
   acquired either in consequence of becoming Christians or of becoming
   Methodists. if the former, it devolves on the claimants to prove that
   this right is conferred by the holy Scriptures, and that they impose on
   us the corresponding obligation to grant the claim. That it is not'
   forbidden' in the New Testament is not sufficient; for neither is the
   contrary forbidden.' Or if the latter be alleged, namely, that it has
   been acquired in consequence of becoming Methodists, then it must have
   been either by some conventional compact, or by some obligatory
   principle in the economy of Methodism, to which, as then organized, the
   claimants voluntarily attached themselves. Neither of these, we
   believe, either has been or can be shown. And until one at least of
   these be shown, the claim of right, as such, cannot, we think, have
   been sustained.

   "But do the memorialists mean to say that they are entitled to their
   claim, as a matter of right, against the judgment and the voice of a
   confessedly very large majority of their brethren, both of the ministry
   traveling and local, and also f the lay members? or that in these
   circumstances, on any ground, the claim ought to be admitted?. We Could
   not have believed them capable of so Strange a position, had they not
   declared the opinion as prevailing among themselves, that the extension
   of the principle of representation to the members and the local
   preachers of the Church, by the General Conference, in compliance with
   a petition of this kind, at this conjuncture of time, would do more
   toward conciliating good feeling, restoring lost confidence among
   brethren, and confirming wavering minds, on all sides, than any other
   measure which can be adopted.'

   "Now we 'speak advisedly' when we say, that, in our judgment, such a
   measure, at this conjuncture of time,' would have a precisely contrary
   effect. The ministers assembled in General Conference, coming so
   recently from all parts of the great field of our missionary labors,
   and having had, throughout its whole extent, free and constant
   intercourse both with traveling and local preachers, and also with our
   lay members, are, certainly, at least as well prepared as the
   memorialists could have been to form L correct judgment on this point;
   and their calm and deliberate judgment is clearly and unhesitatingly as
   above-stated. This we believe, too, to be the true state of the
   question, after it has been so zealously discussed, on the side of the
   memorialists, for now nearly eight years'; during almost the whole of
   which time, until very recently, the discussion has been conducted
   almost exclusively by their own writers.

   "We are aware that it has been assumed, by some at least of those
   writers, that this repugnance to the change proposed, on the part of so
   great a proportion both of our local preachers and lay members, to say
   nothing of the itinerant preachers, is the result of ignorance or want
   of intellect. This we conceive to be at least not a very modest
   assumption. Our opinion, on the contrary, is, while we freely admit
   that there are men of respectable information and intelligence who
   desire the change, that there are, nevertheless, very many more, of at
   least equally respectable information and intelligence, who are opposed
   to it, whether on the ground of right, of consistent practicability, or
   of utility.

   "With regard to our local brethren particularly, it is our decided
   judgment that the privileges and advantages in which they have
   participated, in this country, have much rather exceeded than fallen
   short of what was contemplated in their institution, in the original
   economy of Methodism, as founded by the venerable Wesley, either in
   Europe or in America. We cannot but regret to perceive, that the
   addition of privilege to privilege seems only to have had the effect of
   exciting some of our brethren to claim still more and more; and now to
   begin to demand them as matters of positive and inherent right. We are
   happy to be able to say 'some' only of our local brethren; for of the
   great body, even of themselves, we believe better things, though we
   thus speak. If; indeed, our members generally are tired of our
   missionary and itinerant system, and wish a change, then we could not
   be surprised if they should desire to introduce into our councils local
   men, whose views, and feelings, and interests, in the very nature and
   necessity of things, could not fail to be more local than those of
   itinerant men. And if to so powerful a local influence should be added,
   as would be added, the tendencies and temptations to locality which, in
   despite of all our better convictions, too often exist among ourselves,
   from domestic and personal considerations of a pressing character, we
   are free to confess our fears of the dangers to our itinerant economy
   which, in our opinion, could not fail, in time, to be the result. Now
   the preservation of the great itinerant system, unimpaired, in all its
   vital energies, we do conscientiously believe to be essential to the
   accomplishment of the grand original design of the economy of
   Methodism, to spread Scriptural holiness over these and other lands.

   "The memorialists, we know, disavow any intention or desire to impair
   those energies, or to injure this system. Be it so. They can, however,
   only speak for themselves. They know not what may be the views of those
   who may come after them. And, in any event, our argument is, that the
   change proposed would, in its very nature, and from the inevitable
   connections of causes and effects, tend, gradually perhaps, yet not the
   less uncontrollably, to the results which we have mentioned.

   "We know also that it has been insinuated that we adhere to the
   continuance of our present polity from motives of personal interest.
   For protection against such unkindness and injustice we rest on the
   good sense and candor of the community. It cannot but be well known
   that our present economy bears with a peculiar severity upon the
   personal and domestic comforts of the itinerant ministry. And even an
   enemy could scarcely fail to admit that, were we really ambitious of
   worldly interest, and of personal ease, and domestic comfort, we might
   have the discernment to perceive that the surest way to effect these
   objects would be to effect the changes proposed, and thus to prepare
   the way for the enjoyment of similar advantages, in these respects, to
   those now enjoyed by the settled ministry of other churches. And,
   indeed, were such a change effected, and should we even still continue
   itinerant, considering that, from the necessity of things, our wealthy
   and liberal friends would most generally be selected as delegates, we
   do not doubt that the change proposed might probably tend to increase
   our temporal comforts. We think this the more probable, because, if
   such a direct representation of the laity were admitted, their
   constituents might ultimately become obliged, by some positive
   provisions, fully to make up and pay whatever allowances might be made
   to the ministry; which allowances, in this event, might also more
   properly acquire the nature of a civil obligation. At present our
   economy knows no such thing. The great Head of the church himself has
   imposed on us the duty of preaching the gospel, of administering its
   ordinances, and of maintaining its moral discipline among those over
   whom the Holy Ghost, in these respects, has made us overseers. Of these
   also, namely, of gospel doctrines, ordinances, and moral discipline, we
   do believe that the divinely instituted ministry are the divinely
   authorized expounders; and that the duty of maintaining them in their
   purity, and of not permitting our ministrations, in these respects, to
   be authoritatively controlled by others, does rest upon us with the
   force of a moral obligation, in the due discharge of which our
   consciences are involved. It is on this ground that we resist the
   temptations of temporal advantage which the proposed changes hold out
   to us.

   "On this point we beg, however, that no one may either misunderstand or
   misrepresent us. We neither claim nor seek to be lords over God's
   heritage.' In the sense of this passage, there is but one Lord and one
   Lawgiver. We arrogate no authority to enact any laws of our own, either
   of moral or of civil force. Our commission is to preach the gospel, and
   to enforce the moral discipline, established by the one Lawgiver, by
   those spiritual powers vested in us, as subordinate pastors, who watch
   over souls as they that must give account to the chief Shepherd. We
   claim no strictly legislative powers, although we grant that the terms
   legislature' and legislative' have been sometimes used even among
   ourselves. In a proper sense, however, they are not strictly applicable
   to our General Conference. A mistake on this point has probably been
   the source of much erroneous reasoning, and of some consequent
   dissatisfaction. Did we claim any authority to enact laws to affect
   either life or limb, to touch the persons or to tax the property of our
   members, they ought, unquestionably, to be directly represented among
   us. But they know we do not. We certainly, then, exercise no civil
   legislation. As to the moral code, we are subject, equally with
   themselves, to one only Lord. We have no power to add to, to take from,
   to alter, or to modify a single item of his statutes. Whether laymen or
   ministers be the authorized expounders and administrators of those
   laws, we can confidently rely on the good Christian sense of the great
   body of our brethren to judge. These well know, also, that whatever
   expositions of them we apply to others, the same are applied equally to
   ourselves, and, in some instances, with peculiar strictness.

   "No man is obliged to receive our doctrines merely because we believe
   and teach them, nor unless they have his own cordial assent. Neither is
   any man obliged to submit himself to what we believe to be the moral
   discipline of the gospel, and our duty to enforce, unless he believes
   it to be so also. In this view, at least, it cannot require any great
   share of either intelligence or candor to perceive some difference
   between our spiritual and pastoral oversight and the absolute sway of
   the ancient Druids,' and of the despots of Babylon and Egypt,' and of
   India and Tartary.' The subjects of their lawless power became so not
   by choice, but by birth. Neither had they the means, whatever might
   have been their desire, of escaping its grasp. Even in more modern
   days, and under governments comparatively free, the right of
   expatriation, without the consent of the government, has been denied.
   We do not subscribe to this doctrine, if applied to either church or
   state. The right of ecclesiastical expatriation, from any one branch of
   the Christian church to any other which may be preferred, for grave
   causes, we have never denied. Nor can we keep, nor are we desirous to
   keep, any man subject to our authority one moment longer than it is his
   own pleasure. We advert to this topic with great reluctance, but the
   memorialists compel us. If they will cease to compare us to despots, to
   whom we bear no analogy, we shall cease to exhibit the obvious
   distinction. Till then it is our duty to repel the imputation, so
   obstructive of our ministry. Expatriation, either civil or
   ecclesiastical, if we may continue this application of the term, may be
   painful, and attended with sacrifices. But we should certainly think it
   preferable to perpetual internal war. If our brethren can live in peace
   with us, in Christian bonds, we shall sincerely rejoice, and be
   cordially happy in their society and fellowship. But we entreat them
   not to keep us embroiled in perpetual strife. Our united energies are
   needed for higher and nobler purposes.

   "We have been repeatedly told, in effect, that the doctrines, the moral
   discipline, and the peculiar Christian privileges of class meetings,
   love feasts, &c., in the Methodist Episcopal Church, are approved and
   esteemed, by the various memorialists themselves, above those of any
   other branch of the Christian church. Does it not then clearly follow,
   by their own admission, that, with all the faults of our government,
   this state of things has been preserved and maintained under the
   peculiar administrations of our itinerant system? And who will
   undertake to say that, under a gracious Providence, which has thus led
   us on, this has not, in a great measure at least, been the result of
   the distinctness of our polity from that of most other churches? And
   who will undertake to say that, were the changes proposed adopted, we
   should not gradually, though at first perhaps almost imperceptibly,
   begin to go the way of others? We speak to Methodists. They will judge
   what we say. The moral results of our past and present polity have been
   tried. Its fruits are before us, and confessed by the world. The
   experiment proposed, in connection with an essentially itinerant
   system, is untried. Its results, at best, must be problematical; and,
   in our opinion, there is no prospect of gain that can justify the
   hazard.

   "With regard to our local brethren particularly, they have themselves
   explicitly said, that they ask for no distinct representation of the
   local preachers.' So far as this question is concerned, therefore, by
   their own consent, they can only be regarded as amalgamated with the
   laity: and our lay brethren, we apprehend, would not readily consent to
   its being considered in any other light.

   "Were we disposed to retort the insinuation of sinister personal
   motives, how easy would it be for us to suggest that some of our local
   brethren who have deserted the itinerant field, (perhaps from its toils
   and privations,) and others who have never been pleased to leave
   domestic comforts and temporal pursuits to encounter its labors and
   sacrifices, may be so zealous in accomplishing the proposed change in
   order to cut up, or to bring down, the itinerant system to a nearer
   approximation to their temporal convenience. So that, in time, they
   might come, without the sacrifices at present necessary, to participate
   both in the pastoral charge, and, alas! in the envied pittance of those
   who now devote themselves wholly to the work, and are absolutely
   dependent for daily subsistence on the mere voluntary contributions of
   those whom they serve: (a check on their power indeed!) Such an
   imputation would be quite as kind and as true as many of those which
   are so liberally heaped on us. This course of argumentation, however,
   we deem unworthy of Christian brethren, and shall leave it for those
   who think their cause requires it. The man who can believe, or who can
   endeavor to persuade others, that we adhere to our present itinerant
   system for the sake of personal convenience, ease, or interest, or with
   the view of benefiting our posterity more than the posterity of our
   brethren, maybe pitied, but he places himself beyond the reach either
   of reasoning or of rebuke.

   "The memorialists were sensible that a plan' of their proposed changes
   had been urgently called for, and seem to have been well aware that
   rational and conscientious men could not feel free to enter upon so
   great a revolution, in a system of such extent and of such connections,
   without a plan, clearly and frankly developed, and bearing the marks of
   having been carefully and judiciously devised. The memorialists indeed
   say, that, independently of other considerations,' they were disposed
   to avoid the attempt to form a plan, out of deference to the General
   Conference.' It would have been more satisfactory to us to have known
   what those other considerations' were. From some other circumstances,
   we cannot but apprehend that they probably had more influence in
   keeping back the expose of a plan' than the one mentioned here, of --
   deference to the General Conference.' On our part, we frankly confess
   ourselves incompetent to form any satisfactory plan, on any principles
   which we believe to be equal and efficient, and consistent with the
   energies and greatest usefulness of our extended missionary system. We
   think it, therefore, unreasonable, at least, to ask of us to contrive a
   plan.'

   "So far as we can judge from any experiment that has been made, in
   Europe or in America, we cannot perceive any great advantages which
   could be promised to the Church from the proposed change. Nor has the
   late convention in Baltimore afforded to our understanding any
   additional argument for its efficient practicability. Agreeably to the
   journal of that convention, one hundred persons were appointed to
   attend it, of whom fifty-seven only did attend, namely, from the state
   of New York, one; North Carolina, two Ohio, four; District of Columbia,
   four; Pennsylvania, seven; Virginia, ten; and Maryland, twenty-nine.
   Now that convention had been urgently called, by repeated public
   advertisements, and was expected to be held but a few days, to discuss
   subjects represented as of great importance and deep interest. Liberal
   invitations were given, and comfortable and free accommodations
   pledged. Yet, notwithstanding the novelty of the assembly, the
   pleasantness of the season, and other inviting circumstances, a very
   few more than one half of the whole number appointed attended. And had
   it required two-thirds of that number to constitute a quorum, as in our
   General Conference, after all their labor and expense, no business
   could have been done, for there would have been no quorum. Of the
   number that did attend, too, it will be perceived that a majority of
   the whole were from the state of Maryland, within which the convention
   was held; and, including the neighboring District of Columbia, a
   decisive majority. This exhibits a practical proof that, were a lay
   delegation even admitted, the consequence would be, that the
   extremities of our Church would not be, in fact, represented at all,
   but would be subjected to the overwhelming control of those within the
   vicinity of the seat of the conference; a state of things which, we
   believe, is not desirable. This may serve also, perhaps, to account, in
   some measure, for the great zeal which some of our brethren have
   exhibited in this cause, particularly in the state of Maryland and the
   adjoining district, and in the city of Baltimore, where the General
   Conference has usually been held. Were it established that the General
   Conference should always be held in St. Louis or New Orleans, or any
   other remote part, we cannot but think that the zeal of some, in that
   case, would probably be very much abated. Even they would scarcely be
   willing to travel so great a distance, at so much expense and loss of
   time, to remain three or four weeks at a General Conference.

   "In another document, issued by the convention above alluded to, they
   say, We have been laboring with great attention and perseverance to put
   the public in possession of our views as fast as we can.' They have
   also had in circulation for many years a monthly periodical
   publication, for the express purpose of diffusing their views and
   advocating their cause, besides the institution of what have been
   called Union Societies, and of late a convention. Yet, after all these
   exertions, the great body of our ministers, both traveling and local,
   as well as of our members, perhaps not much if any short of one hundred
   to one, still oppose their wishes. This, as before said, has been
   assumed to be from ignorance or want of intellect, or from some worse
   principle. But we believe it to be the result of a firm and deliberate
   attachment to our existing institutions and economy an attachment which
   we have the happiness of believing to be increased, rather than
   diminished, in proportion to the development of the details of any
   plans which the memorialists have yet seen fit to exhibit. We put it,
   then, to the good sense, to the Christian candor, and to the calmer and
   better feelings of our brethren, whether it be not time to cease to
   agitate and disturb the Church with this controversy? -- at least, if
   it must be continued, whether it be not time to divest it of that
   acrimony and virulence which, in too many instances, we fear, has
   furnished fit matter for the scoff of the infidel and the reproach of
   common enemies? If this state of things be continued, how can it be
   said, See how these Christians love one another!' It grieves us to
   think of it. We weep between the porch and the altar; and our cry is,
   Spare, O Lord! spare thy people, and give not thine heritage to this
   reproach.'

   "We know that we have been charged with wishing to suppress free
   inquiry, and with denying to our ministers and members the liberty of
   speech and of the press. Our feelings, under such reiterated and widely
   circulated charges, would tempt us to repel them with strong
   expressions. If reviled, however, we are resolved not to revile again.
   But the charge we wholly disavow. Our ministers and members, of every
   class, are entitled to the full liberty of speech and of the press,
   equally with any other citizens of the United States, subject solely to
   the restrictions and responsibilities imposed by the laws of the land,
   by the obligations of Christianity, and by the existing regulations
   under which we are voluntarily associated, as Methodists and as
   Methodist ministers. The rule in our Discipline, sec. 7, p.91,' (new
   edition, p. 88,) of which some of the memorialists complain, never was
   intended (and we are not aware that it has at any time been officially
   so construed) to suppress such freedom of inquiry, or to deny such
   liberty of speech and of the press; provided such inquiry be conducted,
   and such liberty be used, in a manner consistent with the
   above-mentioned obligations. The design of the rule was to guard the
   peace and union of the Church against any mischievous false brethren,
   who might be disposed to avail themselves of their place in the bosom
   of the Church to endeavors to sow dissensions, by inveighing against
   our doctrines or discipline, in the sense of unchristian railing and
   violence. Any other construction of it we have never sanctioned, nor
   will we. In this view of this rule, we cannot consent to its abolition.
   On the contrary, we regard it as a Christian and useful rule, and
   particularly necessary, at the present time, for the well-being of the
   Church. It is aimed against licentiousness, and not against liberty. In
   the state, as well as in the church, it is found necessary to subject
   both speech and the press to certain legal responsibilities, which
   undoubtedly operate as restraints, and tend to guard against
   licentiousness, by exposing offenders to penalties corresponding to the
   extent of their abuse of liberty. And we confess ourselves among the
   number of those who, with statesmen and jurists, as well as divines,
   maintain that even a despotic government is preferable to a state of
   unbridled anarchy.

   "By insinuations of the above description, and by others of an
   analogous character, attempts have been made to excite against us the
   jealousy and suspicion of statesmen and politicians, and of the
   constituted authorities of the civil government. This low stratagem we
   have always regarded as peculiarly deserving the rebuke of every
   generous mind, even among our opponents: and we cannot believe
   otherwise than that it had its origin either in some distempered mind
   or some perverted heart. The memorialists wish the government of the
   Church to be assimilated to that of the state. We think, on the other
   hand, that as there neither is nor ought to be any connection between
   church and state, so neither is there any obligation or necessity to
   conform the government of the one to that of the other. That both their
   origin and their objects differ; and that to aim at conforming them to
   each other would be more likely, in the course of human events, to
   terminate in their amalgamation, than the course of denying such
   analogy, and maintaining the two jurisdictions on their peculiarly
   distinctive bases, under regulations adapted to the objects for which
   they were severally designed. In the instances of civil and religious
   despotism alluded to by the memorialists, as recorded in history, the
   powers of church and state were combined, and no means were left to the
   people of appealing or of escaping from the one or from the other. The
   first step toward producing such a state of things would be to bring
   ministers of religion and officers of state into a nearer alliance with
   each other, and thus gradually to effect an assimilation of views, and
   feelings, and interests. The way being thus prepared, politicians and
   statesmen might be introduced into our ecclesiastical councils, and, by
   a mutual' combination, aid each other in the accumulation of power and
   influence. We do not affirm that any of the memorialists seriously
   meditate such designs. But we do say, that, according to our
   understanding of the natural tendency of things, the change proposed is
   just such a one as would be most likely to be adopted by men of policy
   for the accomplishment of such an object; and that, in the present
   state of the world, nothing would be more impolitic than the
   continuance of our present economy with any such ambitious schemes in
   view as some, we fear, and must say, have malevolently insinuated.

   "With regard to what have been called Union Societies,' we consider the
   organization of these distinct bodies within the bosom of the Church as
   the baneful source of the principal evils which of late have so
   painfully afflicted and distracted some portions of our charge. Such
   associations, within the pale of the Church, have arrayed and combined
   all the workings of the spirit of patty in their most pernicious and
   destructive forms. They have drawn a line of separation between those
   who compose them and their brethren, as organized and systematic
   adversaries. They have separated chief friends; they have severed the
   most sacred and endearing ties; and have caused and fomented discord
   and strife in circles before distinguished for peace and love. And
   under whatever plausible pretexts they may have been instituted, the
   Church generally, we believe, has regarded them as calculated, if not
   designed, either to obstruct the due administration of discipline, by
   overawing the administration of it, or to prepare an organized
   secession, in case they should fail in modeling the Church according to
   their wishes. With these associations numbers, we have no doubt,
   unwarily became connected at first, from various views, who now feel a
   difficulty in disentangling themselves. If, however, the real object of
   their original institution was to secure an identity of views in the
   communications to be presented to this General Conference, that object
   having been now accomplished, we affectionately and respectfully submit
   it to the peacefully disposed among our brethren who may yet compose
   them, whether there can yet be any remaining obligation to continue in
   them; and whether, in fact, they ought not now to be dissolved. In our
   opinion, considering what have been their past operation and effects,
   the general peace of the Church can never be restored and settled on
   any firm and lasting basis till this shall be done.

   "We might add much more, but the time fails us. We entreat our brethren
   to be at peace. It is our earnest and sincere desire. In order to it,
   on our part, we have advised, and do hereby advise and exhort all our
   brethren, and all our ecclesiastical officers, to cultivate on all
   occasions the meekness and gentleness of Christ; and to exercise all
   the lenity, moderation, and forbearance which may be consistent with
   the purity of our institutions, and the due and firm administration of
   necessary discipline, the sacrifice of which we could not but deem too
   costly, even for peace.

   "In conclusion, we say to brethren, If there be, therefore, any
   consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the
   Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye our joy, that ye be like
   minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let the
   peace of God rule in our hearts, to the which also we are called in one
   body; and let us be thankful. Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
   things are just, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
   good report, if there be any virtue and any praise, let us think on
   these things. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and
   evil speaking be put away from us, with all malice. And nay the God of
   love and peace be with us.'"

   The following resolutions were adopted also, nearly unanimously: --

   "Whereas an unhappy excitement has existed in some parts of our work,
   in consequence of the organization of what have been called Union
   Societies, for purposes, and under regulations, believed to be
   inconsistent with the peace and harmony of the Church; and in relation
   to the character of much of the matter contained in a certain
   periodical publication, called Mutual Rights,' in regard to which
   certain expulsions from the Church have taken place: and whereas this
   General Conference indulges a hope that a mutual desire may exist for
   conciliation and peace, and is desirous of leaving open a way for the
   accomplishment of so desirable an object, on safe and equitable
   principles; therefore, Resolved, &c.,

   "1. That in view of the premises, and in the earnest hope that this
   measure may tend to promote this object, this General Conference
   affectionately advises that no further proceedings may be had, in any
   part of our work, against any minister or member of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, on account of any past agency or concern in relation
   to the above-named periodical, or in relation to any Union Society as
   above mentioned.

   "2. If any persons, expelled as aforesaid, feel free to concede that
   publications have appeared in said Mutual Rights,' the nature and
   character of which were unjustifiably inflammatory, and do not admit of
   vindication; and that others, though for want of proper information, or
   unintentionally, have yet, in fact, misrepresented individuals and
   facts, and that they regret these things: if it be voluntarily agreed,
   also, that the Union Societies above alluded to shall be abolished, and
   the periodical called Mutual Rights' be discontinued at the close of
   the Current volume, which shall be completed with due respect to the
   conciliatory and pacific design of this arrangement; then this General
   Conference does hereby give authority for the restoration to their
   ministry or membership respectively, in the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   of any person or persons so expelled, as aforesaid; provided this
   arrangement shall be mutually assented to by any individual or
   individuals so expelled, and also by the quarterly meeting conference,
   and the minister or preacher having the charge in any circuit or
   station within which any such expulsion may have taken place; and that
   no such minister or preacher shall be obliged, under this arrangement,
   to restore any such individual as leader of any class or classes,
   unless in his own discretion he shall judge it proper so to do; and
   provided also, that it be further mutually agreed that no other
   periodical publication, to be devoted to the same controversy, shall be
   established on either side; it being expressly understood, at the same
   time, that this, if agreed to, will be on the ground, not of any
   assumption of right to require this, but of mutual consent, for the
   restoration of peace; and that no individual will be hereby precluded
   from issuing any publication which he may judge proper, on his own
   responsibility. It is further understood, that any individual or
   individuals who may have withdrawn from the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   on account of any proceedings in relation to the premises, may also be
   restored, by mutual consent, under this arrangement, on the same
   principles as above stated."

   This decision, so far as the General Conference was concerned, set the
   question at rest, giving all concerned distinctly to understand that
   such a radical change in our government could not be allowed, and
   therefore all efforts directed to that end were and would be
   unavailing.

   Some have expressed their surprise that the General Conference was so
   unwilling to yield to the voice of the people! The answer is, that the
   voice of the people was yielded to, so far as it could be heard and
   understood. It is believed that nine-tenths of our people throughout
   the United States, could they have been heard, were decidedly opposed
   to the innovations which were urged. They were not only contented with
   the present order of things, but they loved their institutions,
   venerated their ministers, and were astounded at the bold manner in
   which they were both assailed from the pulpit and the press. In
   resisting, therefore, the proposed changes, the conference believed it
   went with, and not against, the popular voice of the Church; and the
   result has proved that it was not in error; for it has been fully
   sustained in its course by the great body of preachers and people in
   all the annual conferences and throughout the entire Church; and it
   has, moreover, had the sanction of at least some of the "Reformers"
   themselves, who have become convinced that they calculated on a higher
   state of individual and social perfection than they have found
   attainable, and that it is much easier to shake and uproot established
   institutions than it is to raise up and render permanent a new order of
   things truth which should teach all revolutionists the necessity of
   caution and moderation in their measures.

   It will be perceived that one of the resolutions in the above report
   proposed terms on which the expelled members might be restored to their
   former standing in the Church. It is not known, however, that any of
   them availed themselves of this privilege; but, on the contrary, a very
   considerable number, both in Baltimore and other places, withdrew from
   the Church, and put themselves under the wing of "reform;" while a few,
   who still proved refractory, in Cincinnati, Lynchburg, and some other
   places, were tried and expelled. The exact number lost to the Church I
   have not been able to ascertain; but by turning to the Minutes of our
   conferences, and comparing the numbers for 1828 with those for 1829, I
   find the increase of members to be 29,305, [30] and of preachers 175;
   for 1830 the increase of members is 28,257, and of preachers 83. And as
   this is quite equal to the usual increase from one year to another, the
   secession could not have included a great number of either members or
   preachers. In the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
   Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati were found the greatest number of
   "Reformers." [31] Here they organized churches and established
   congregations in conformity to their improved plan of procedure: but it
   is believed that in all these as their influence has been on the wane
   for some time, and that, while several have returned to the Church
   which they had left, others have become wear and vexed with "reform,"
   being convinced that they calculated too highly on the perfection of
   human nature not to be disappointed in their expectations.

   It seems right, therefore, that the reader may have an intelligent view
   of the whole matter, that he should be informed what their plans were,
   that he may perceive the improvements with which they designed to
   perfect the system adopted by the Methodist Episcopal Church. In the
   month of November of this year the "Associated Methodist Churches" held
   a convention in the city of Baltimore, at which a provisional
   government was formed until a constitution and book of discipline could
   be prepared at a future convention. This convention assembled in the
   city of Baltimore on the second day of November, 1830, and was composed
   of an equal number of lay and clerical delegates from several parts of
   the Union, representing thirteen annual conferences, [32] and continued
   its sessions until the twenty-third of the same month. The convention
   proceeded to the adoption of a "constitution," the first article of
   which fixed the title of the new "Association" to be "The Methodist
   Protestant Church," and the whole community was divided into
   "districts," "circuits," and "stations;" -- the "districts," comprising
   the bounds of an annual conference, to be composed of an equal number
   of ordained itinerant ministers and delegates, elected either from the
   local preachers or lay members; -- the General Conference was to
   consist of an equal number of ministers and laymen, to be elected by
   the annual conferences, and must assemble every seventh year for the
   transaction of business.

   The offices of bishop and presiding elder were abolished, and both the
   annual and General Conferences were to elect their presidents by ballot
   to preside over their deliberations; and the presidents of annual
   conferences were also to travel through their districts, to visit all
   the circuits and stations, and, as far as practicable, to be present at
   quarterly and camp meetings; -- to ordain, assisted by two or more
   elders, such as might be duly recommended; to change preachers in the
   interval of conference, provided their consent be first obtained. The
   chief points, therefore, in which they differ from us are, that they
   have abolished episcopacy, and admit laymen to a participation of all
   the legislative and judicial departments of the government. Class,
   society, and quarterly meetings, annual and General Conferences, and an
   itinerant ministry, they have preserved. They also hold fast the
   fundamental doctrines of our Church and its moral discipline. The
   verbal alterations which they have introduced into some portions of the
   prayers, moral and prudential regulations, will not, it is believed,
   enhance their worth in the estimation of any sober and enlightened
   mind. This, however, may be more a matter of taste than of sound verbal
   criticism, as it is hardly to be supposed that judicious men would
   alter "the form of sound words" merely for the sake of altering.

   Though a separate community was thus established, it was a considerable
   time before the agitations ceased. It was but natural for those who had
   withdrawn from the Church to attempt a justification of themselves fore
   the public by assigning reasons for their proceedings, and by an effort
   to put their antagonists in the wrong. And as they had a periodical at
   their. command, writers were not wanting to volunteer their services in
   defense of their measures, and in opposition to what they considered
   the objectionable features of the Methodist Episcopal Church. This
   called for defense on the part of those more immediately implicated by
   the writers in "Mutual Rights." And as Baltimore had been the chief
   seat of the controversy from the beginning, and as it was thought not
   advisable to make the columns of the Christian Advocate and Journal a
   medium for conducting the controversy, the brethren in that city
   established a weekly paper, called "The Itinerant," which was devoted
   especially to the vindication of the government, ministers, and usages
   of the Methodist Episcopal Church, containing, in the mean time,
   animadversions upon the newly constituted government, and a replication
   to the arguments of its advocates in its defense. Many very able pieces
   appeared from time to time in "The Itinerant," in defense of the
   proceedings of the authorities of the Church in the city of Baltimore,
   of the General Conference, and those annual conferences which had acted
   in the premises. These contributed greatly to settle the questions at
   issue on a just and firm basis, and to show that these things were
   susceptible of a Scriptural and rational defense.

   But the spirit of contention, which had long been impatient of control,
   at length became wearied, and the combatants gradually retired from the
   field of controversy, the Itinerant was discontinued, and the Christian
   Advocate and Journal, which had, indeed, said but little on the
   subject, proposed a truce, which seemed to be gladly accepted by the
   dissentient brethren, and they were left to try the strength of their
   newly formed system without further molestation from their old
   brethren.

   On a review of these things, we find much to humble us, and yet much to
   excite our gratitude. In all struggles of this sort the spirits of men
   are apt to become less or more exasperated, brotherly love to be
   diminished, and a strife for the mastery too often usurps the place of
   a holy contention "for the faith once delivered to the saints." That
   the present discussion partook more or less of these common defects, on
   both sides, may be granted, without yielding one iota of the main
   principles for which we contend. Indeed, truth itself may sometimes
   have cause to blush for the imperfect and often rude manner in which
   its disciples attempt to vindicate its injured rights; while error may
   be defended by the wily arts of its advocates with an assumed meekness
   and forbearance which may smooth over its rough edges by their
   ingenious sophistry so effectually as to beguile the simple hearted,
   until the serpent clasps them in its deceitful and relentless coils.
   But extricate yourself from its painful grasp, expose its serpentine
   course, and denounce, in just terms of reprobation, its delusive
   schemes, and it will throw off its disguise, and pour forth, in
   blustering terms, its denunciations against you, with a view to blacken
   your character, and render you odious in the estimation of the wise and
   good. It will then complain of that very injustice which it attempted
   to inflict on you, and will repel all complaints of its own unfairness
   by a repetition of its offensive epithets. Truth, however, has no need
   to resort to finesse, to intrigue, to epithets of abuse, in its own
   defense. Though it can never falsify its own principles, nor yield to
   the demands of error, either in complaisance to its antagonists or to
   soften the tones of honesty and uprightness with which it utters its
   sentiments, yet it seeks not to fortify its positions by a resort to
   the contemptible arts of sophistry, nor to silence its adversaries by a
   substitution of personal abuse for arguments. It expresses itself
   fearlessly and honestly, without disguise or apology, leaving the
   consequences to its sacred Author.

   How far these remarks may apply to those who engaged in the present
   contest I pretend not to determine. But whatever may have been the
   defects in the spirit and manner in which the controversy was
   conducted, we rejoice that it has so far terminated, and that we may
   now calmly review the past, may apologize for mistakes, forgive
   injuries, whether real or imaginary, and exercise a mutual spirit of
   forbearance toward each other. For whatever imperfections of human
   nature may have been exhibited on either side, we have just cause of
   humiliation; and while they teach us the infinite value of the atoning
   blood to cover all such aberrations, they furnish lessons of mutual
   forbearance and forgiveness.

   But while this humbling view of the subject deprives us of all just
   cause of boasting, we may, it is thought, perceive much in the result
   which should excite our gratitude. To the intelligent friends of our
   Church organization, of our established and long continued usages and
   institutions, it gave an opportunity of examining their foundation, of
   testing their soundness and strength, and of defending them against
   their assailants. Having proved them susceptible of a Scriptural and
   rational vindication; we have reason to believe that they became not
   only better understood, but more highly appreciated and sincerely
   loved. Experience and practice having furnished us with those weapons
   of defense to which we might otherwise have remained strange, we have
   learned the lessons of wisdom from the things we have been called to
   suffer, and an increased veneration for our cherished institutions has
   been the beneficial consequence. Greater peace and harmony within our
   borders succeeded to the storms of agitation and division. Our own
   Church organization and plans of procedure have been made to appear
   more excellent from contrasting them with those substituted by the
   seceding party; and so far as success may be relied upon as a test of
   the goodness and beneficial tendency of any system of operations, we
   have no temptation to forsake "the old paths" for the purpose of
   following in the track of those who have opened the untrodden way of
   "reform," or to be shaken by the strong "protest" they have entered
   against our peculiar organization and manner of conducting our affairs.

   In narrating the facts in this perplexing case I have aimed at
   historical truth. In doing this I may have wounded the feelings of some
   who were the more immediate actors in the scenes which have passed
   before us. This, however, was very far from my intention. I have,
   indeed, labored most assiduously to present the facts in as inoffensive
   language as possible, consistently with the demands of impartial
   history, and therefore hope to escape the censure justly due to those
   who willfully pervert the truth or misinterpret its language. No will I
   claim for myself any other apology for unintentional errors than
   fallible humanity has a right to exact from candid criticism. And now
   that the struggle is over, may we all, pursuing our respective modes of
   doing good, "as far as possible, live peaceably with all men."

   The cause of missions, of education, and of the American Colonization
   Society, was duly considered, and highly recommended to the approbation
   and support of our people; and the reports and resolutions in reference
   to these several subjects no doubt tended much to advance their
   respective claims upon the public munificence.

   The constitutional term of Nathan Bangs, as editor and general book
   agent, having expired, he was elected editor of the Christian Advocate
   and Journal, and John Emory was appointed to succeed him in the general
   editorship and agency, and Beverly Waugh was elected the assistant of
   Dr. Emory.

   The following provision was made respecting the appointment of
   trustees: -- When a new board of trustees is to be created, it shall be
   done (except in those states and territories where the statutes provide
   differently) by the appointment of the preacher in charge, or by the
   presiding elder;" -- thus approving the election of trustees according
   to the laws of the respective states and territories, and at the same
   time providing for the manner in which they shall be appointed where no
   such laws exist.

   The Rev. William Capers was elected as a delegate to represent us to
   the Wesleyan Methodist conference in the succeeding month of July, and
   he bore with him the following address: --

  ADDRESS

    Of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, to the Wesleyan
    Methodist Conference.

   "Beloved Fathers and Brethren: -- Having, by the mercy of our God,
   brought the present session of our General Conference near to a close,
   we avail ourselves of this opportunity to convey to you our Christian
   salutations. Our beloved brother, the Rev. William Capers, whom we have
   elected as our representative to your conference, will more fully
   explain to you the state of our affairs, the strong affection we bear
   to you as our elder brethren, and our fervent desire to preserve with
   you the bond of peace and the unity of the Spirit.

   "Our present session, though laborious, and involving various and
   important points vitally connected with the interests of our Church,
   and of Christianity generally, has been marked with general harmony of
   feeling and mutual good-will; and we humbly trust it will tend to
   strengthen the bond of union among ourselves, more fully to combine our
   strength, to concentrate and harmonize our views and affections, and to
   give a new impulse to the great work in which we are engaged.

   "To stimulate us to diligence in this most sacred of all causes, the
   bright example of your persevering efforts in the cause of God is
   placed before us. Deriving our doctrines from the same great fountain
   of truth, the Holy Scriptures, and admitting the same medium of
   interpretation, the venerated Wesley and his coadjutors, and, we humbly
   hope, pursuing the same great objects, the present and future salvation
   of souls, we desire ever to cultivate with you the closest bond of
   union and Christian fellowship. Under the influence of these views and
   feelings, we have rejoiced in your prosperity, and witnessed with
   unmingled pleasure the extension of your work, particularly in your
   missionary department.

   "With you, also, we have our portion of afflictions. Through the
   disaffection of some, and the honest, though, as we think, mistaken
   zeal of others, in some parts of our extended work, the harmony of our
   people has been disturbed, and principles, to us novel in their
   character, and deleterious in their influence on the excellent system
   we have received from our fathers, have been industriously circulated.
   Though we may not flatter ourselves that these unhappy excitements are
   fully terminated, yet we presume to hope that the decided and almost
   unanimous expression of disapprobation to such proceedings by this
   General Conference, and among our preachers and people generally, will
   greatly weaken the disaffection, and tend to correct the errors of the
   wandering, as well as to confirm and strengthen the hands of all who
   desire to cleave to the Lord in one faith, one baptism, and one hope of
   our calling.'

   "Since our last session, we have witnessed, with joy and gratitude, an
   unusual effusion of the Holy Spirit. Revivals of religion have been
   numerous and extensive in almost every part of our continent. Upward of
   sixty-nine thousand have been added to our Church during the past four
   years, and the work is still extending. Stretching our lines over so
   large a continent, many parts of our work, particularly in the new
   settlements, require great personal sacrifices to carry to them the
   blessings of our ministry, and much diligence and patient perseverance
   to preserve our beloved people in the unity of the faith. For these
   great objects we are not sufficient -- our sufficiency is of God.' But
   having devoted ourselves exclusively to this work, and confiding in the
   strength and goodness of Him whose we are, and whom we profess to serve
   in the fellowship of the gospel, we hope not to faint in the day of
   trial, but to persevere in conveying the glad tidings of peace to the
   destitute inhabitants of our land, until every part of it shall break
   forth into singing, and hail with joy the coming of the Lord.

   "Cheered with this prospect, we are endeavoring to strengthen each
   other in the Lord. And the happy results of our missionary labors, both
   among the frontier settlements of our white population and the Indian
   tribes, particularly the latter, are pleasing indications of the divine
   approbation. It does, indeed, seem as if the set time had come to favor
   these lost tribes of our wildernesses, and to bring them into the fold
   of Christ. These natives, hitherto peeled and scattered,' in the United
   States and territories, as well as in Upper Canada, are bowing to the
   yoke of Christ with astonishing alacrity, and thus giving evidence that
   his grace is sufficient to convert even the heart of a savage, and to
   transform him to the gentleness of Christ. On this subject, however, we
   need not enlarge, but refer you to our periodical works -- the
   extensive circulation of which among our people gives increased impulse
   to the work, carrying information, cheering and delightful, to many
   thousands, of the efficacy and triumph of redeeming mercy -- and to our
   beloved brother and representative, the bearer of this address, who
   will more particularly tell you, face to face,' how much we rejoice to
   be co-workers with you in the extensive field of labor, and to witness
   such evident tokens of the divine goodness to our fallen world.

   "Recollecting the Christian deportment, the ministerial gravity and
   dignity, and, what is more endearing to us, the brotherly affection of
   your late delegate to our conference, the Rev. Richard Reece, and his
   amiable companion, the Rev. John Hannah, both of whom have left a sweet
   savor behind them, we take much pleasure in giving to you this renewed
   assurance of our unabated attachment to those doctrines, and that
   discipline, by which both you and we are distinguished; to set our seal
   to the maxim, that the Wesleyan Methodists are one throughout the
   world;' and also our desire that the intercourse between us, by the
   mutual exchange of delegates, may be kept up and continued; and that,
   as a means of our edification and comfort, we shall be happy to receive
   whomsoever you may appoint to visit us at our next session.

   "With sentiments of unfeigned respect and Christian affection, we are,
   dear brethren, one with you in the fellowship of Jesus Christ.

   "Signed in behalf of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, held at Pittsburgh, (Pa.,) May, 1828.

   "Enoch George, President. "Martin Ruter, Secretary."

   Thus closed the labors of the General Conference of 1828, and here I
   close the third volume of this History, with an expression of gratitude
   to the Author of all good for sparing my life and health so far to
   complete my undertaking.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [25] Freeborn Garrettson was elected from this conference, but deceased
   before the meeting of the General Conference.

   [26] This being the name by which those brethren chose to designate
   themselves, I have used it as a term of distinction, without allowing
   that they were in reality reformers, either in or of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church. To reform is to make over; and they seem to have
   become convinced themselves of the inappropriateness of the term, by
   dropping it, and substituting in Its place Protestant Methodists,
   implying, that though they could not reform us -- that is, make us
   better -- they could at least protest against our peculiarities.

   [27] The author would gladly draw a veil over this affair, were it
   consistent with historic truth; but Mr. McCaine has so linked himself
   with this controversy that it is not possible to narrate the facts in
   the case without an exposure of the absurdities of his pamphlet; and
   hence his name is given to the public in connection with a transaction
   and as a voucher for declarations which have been as discreditable and
   false as they were injurious to the reputation of some of the purest
   men the world ever saw.

   [28] In the second volume of this History I have given an account of
   the discussions upon the presiding elder question. There is reason to
   believe that the leading men among the "Reformers" calculated largely
   on the support of many, if not indeed most of those who favored the
   election of presiding elders; and it is probable that some of these
   would have gone with them had they kept within the bounds of moderation
   in their demands. Yet it ought to be remembered that the two questions
   had no necessary connection -- that the one did not involve the other
   -- and hence it is not surprising that some of the most firm, able, and
   successful opposers of this innovation were among those who bad favored
   the election of the presiding elders, and making them jointly
   responsible with the bishops for the appointments of the preachers.

   [29] All these matters were set in a just point of light soon after
   these trials were closed, in a pamphlet which was published in the
   early part of the year 1828, entitled "A Narrative and Defense," under
   the signatures of the prosecuting committee and the preacher in charge,
   the Rev. Mr. Hanson This "Narrative and Defense," being supported by
   ample documentary testimony, is entitled to credit; and hence it is
   from this able defense of the authorities of the Church, and their
   proceedings in the cases at issue, that I have drawn the principal
   facts contained in the above sketch of this affair. From the Discipline
   afterward adopted by the "Reformers" I have taken some facts respecting
   their secession and subsequent transactions.

   [30] This increase appears after deducting the members in the Canada
   conference, which were, in 1827, 8,595. Had these been included, the
   entire increase would have appeared, as it in reality was, 57,900, and
   of preachers 275. The reason why these were not included was, the
   Canada conference had become independent.

   [31] Though I have earnestly sought, from various sources, to ascertain
   the exact number who were expelled and who seceded from the Church, as
   well as the numbers now belonging to the "Methodist Protestant Church,"
   I have not been able to obtain the information. If any one will furnish
   me with this very desirable information, from any authentic source, I
   will most gladly avail myself of it to perfect this account in a future
   edition. However, that the reader may perceive how far the Church was
   affected in the above-mentioned cities by the secession, I have
   prepared the following tabular view [not tabular in the electronic
   edition -- DVM] of the number of white members in each of them from
   1827 to 1831, inclusive: New York -- 1827: 3,219; 1828: 3,416; 1829:
   3,473; 1830: 3,866; 1831: 4,889. Philadelphia -- 1827: 3,633; 1828:
   3,882; 1829: 4,440; 1830: 4,678; 1831: 4,859. Baltimore -- 1827: 3,631;
   1828: 3,886; 1829: 4,119; 1830: 4,295; 1831: 5,059. Pittsburgh -- 1827:
   737; 1828: 655; 1829: 676; 1830: 630; 1831: 700. Cincinnati -- 1827:
   901; 1828: 915; 1829: 929; 1830: 1,171; 1831: 1,495. As the colored
   members were not much affected either way by these agitations, I have
   left them out of the estimate; and it will be seen that there was a
   gradual increase in all the above cities from 1827 to 1831, the years
   in which the "Methodist Protestants" were maturing their organization,
   except Pittsburgh, and the decrease here was only eighty-two in 1828,
   and forty-six in 1830. The number, therefore, who left us, instead of
   being from twenty to thirty thousand, as was reported at the time, must
   have been very few, or the rivals and admittances very considerable;
   and either alternative shows on which side of the question at issue the
   public mind preponderated; and if revivals of religion and an increase
   of membership may be relied on as an evidence of the divine
   approbation, we have had ample testimony in favor of our proceedings
   and general system of operations: we may therefore, with thankfulness,
   adore the God of our salvation for his unmerited goodness toward us as
   a people, even in the midst of our manifold failures and infirmities.
   It is a fact worthy of record, not, indeed, as matter of vain boasting
   but of humble gratitude to the Author of all good, that "no weapon"
   hitherto "formed against us has prospered" -- nor will it, so long as
   we cleave unto God with full purpose of heart; but "if we forsake him
   he will cast us off for ever," May we then take heed to our ways, that
   we sin not with our lips, nor charge God foolishly in any of our
   conduct!

   [32] Some of these conferences must have been very small, for in
   looking over the list of delegates I find them in the following
   proportions -- From Vermont, two; Massachusetts, two; New York and
   Canada, one; Genesee, eight; New York, two; Pennsylvania, twenty-eight;
   Maryland, twenty-eight; Virginia, twelve; North Carolina, six; Georgia,
   four; Alabama, two; Ohio, sixteen; Western Virginia, two; in all, one
   hundred and thirteen. But as there were thirty-one absentees, the
   convention was composed of eighty-two. From the above the reader may
   see in what portions of our country the "Reformers" were the most
   numerous. Among those who composed this convention there were, I
   believe, but two, the Rev. Messrs. Asa Shinn and George Brown, both of
   the Pittsburgh conference, who were traveling preachers at the time
   they withdrew from us and joined the "Reformers." The rest among the
   clerical delegates were all local preachers, some of whom had once been
   in the itinerant ministry, but had located, and two had been expelled.
   This shows how feeble an impression had been made on the traveling
   ministry in favor of "reform."
