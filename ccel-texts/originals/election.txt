   PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 25, 1854.

   Messrs. HIGGINS & PERKINPINE,--

   I have read with some care the "Lectures on Election, by the Rev.
   Alexander C. Rutherford, of Greenock," and I consider the work to be an
   able exposition of the errors of the predestinarian theory, by one who
   has had every opportunity of understanding that theory, as held by its
   ablest advocates. The argument is clear and convincing; and, for
   general circulation, I deem this book one of the best on the subject
   with which it has been my fortune to meet.

   PHILADELPHIA, January 4, 1854.

   Messrs. HIGGINS & PERKINPINE,--

   I have read a work entitled "Lectures on the Doctrine of Election, by
   Alexander C. Rutherford, Minister of the Gospel, Greenock," and while I
   am not prepared to subscribe to all its minor positions, nor to justify
   all its severities of expression, many of which were prompted, I
   suppose, by circumstances not apparent to the reader, I unhesitatingly
   recommend it as an unanswerable refutation of the Calvinistic doctrines
   of election and reprobation, as placing the truth in a very clear and
   convincing light, and as eminently worthy to be republished and widely
   circulated, especially in view of the efforts now made to engage the
   public confidence for the unscriptural and dangerous tenets which it
   condemns.

PREFACE.

   THE following Discourses were originally delivered in Greenock, towards
   the close of last year, and were again delivered in Glasgow in
   consequence of a requisition, numerously subscribed, by Christian
   brethren in that city. They were not prepared with any intention of
   publication, and their publication has been acquiesced in by the author
   in deference to the request of those who heard them from the pulpit. It
   is hoped that, in spite of all their imperfections, they may perhaps do
   good. They have already opened the eyes of many former opponents who
   heard them delivered. It will be observed that a few remarks have been
   appended to some of the Lectures, chiefly of a practical kind, and here
   and there a few sentences have been added to, or subtracted from, the
   original manuscript. This was deemed necessary as each Lecture was
   necessarily prepared rather hurriedly and formed one of three
   discourses preached weekly to a kind and indulgent people. The author
   is no advocate in general for three discourses being extorted from any
   minister each successive Sabbath, but there are exceptions to every
   general rule; and the present position of the cause with which he has
   the privilege to be connected, induces the necessity for more abundant
   labour upon brethren in the ministry. When he was a minister in the
   United Secession (now United Presbyterian) Church, the author was wont
   to think that Sabbath evening sermons, in addition to other work, was a
   cunning device of Satan, for the purpose of killing the clergy. He
   thinks so still. On this point he is quite orthodox in sentiment. It is
   a remarkable circumstance however, that so long as the author was
   orthodox upon other points he never found it either necessary or
   expedient regularly to trespass in his labour beyond the ordinary
   canonical hours of public Sabbath-day worship, i. e., forenoon and
   afternoon. It would perhaps be too sweeping and hasty an inference to
   conclude from this simple fact, that Satan has a particular liking for
   modern orthodoxy. Such would be a very hasty conclusion to draw from
   one solitary fact, assuming that fact to be correct,, and withal it
   would be vastly uncharitable to include our ancient orthodox friends in
   an alliance with the wicked one, unless the fact of such an alliance
   can be clearly demonstrated. If, however, such a demonstration be
   possible, then it ceases to be uncharitable to exhibit it, and thus to
   warn our esteemed brethren of their position and their danger. In this
   case, brotherly love and ancient friendship and affection, demands the
   production of the evidence which would demonstrate, beyond the
   possibility of refutation, that, under the banner of truth, our
   orthodox brethren are really, though undesignedly, engaged in the
   support and propagation of deadly error. Such is the evidence which we
   profess to exhibit in the following Lectures. It is for the reader to
   say, after a candid and prayerful examination of the evidence, whether
   or not it amounts to a satisfactory demonstration. If it do not, we
   know enough of our former brethren, to assert that there is among them,
   more especially in this good town of Greenock, plenty of orthodox zeal,
   and plenty of talent and learning, to enable them to point out our
   mistake. We respectfully invite them to the task, and we pledge
   ourselves PUBLICLY TO RECANT our error, the moment it is pointed out;
   and most cordially to thank the brother who shall take the trouble to
   prove us in the wrong. Should our Calvinistic friends resort to their
   ordinary mode of warfare, it will not be expected that we should follow
   them into the region of declamation or personal abuse. Of this we are
   contented to take our share, in the company of better men, who have
   preceded us in the advocacy of gospel truth against Calvinistic error.
   Of such abuse we have many examples in the writings of the great
   champion of Calvinism, AUGUSTUS TOPLADY, to whom reference is made in
   the following Lectures.

   This writer is pleased to conclude his preface to Zanchius on
   Predestination, with the following reference to a man of whom the world
   was not worthy--JOHN WESLEY--with the quotation of which we beg to
   close our prefatory remarks.

   "Here ended [says Toplady] the first lesson: i. e., here ended the
   preface to the former edition of this tract,--a tract, whose
   publication has raised the indignant quills of more than one Arminian
   porcupine.

   "Among those enraged porcupines, none has, hitherto, bristled up so
   fiercely as the high and mighty Mr. John Wesley. He even dipt his
   quills in the ink of forgery, on the occasion; as Indians tinge the
   points of their arrows with poison, in hope of their doing more
   effectual execution. The quills, however, have reverberated, and with
   ample interest, on poor Mr. John's own pate. He felt the unexpected
   pain, and he has squeaked accordingly. I will not here add to the
   well-deserved chastisement he has received; which, from more than one
   quarter, has been such as will probably keep him sore, while his
   surname begins with W. Let him, for his own sake, learn, as becomes a
   very sore man, to lie still. Rest may do him good: motion will but add
   to his fever, by irritating his humours, already too peccant.
   PREDESTINATION is a stone, by rashly falling on which he has, more than
   once, been lamentably broken. I wish him to take heed, in due season,
   lest that stone at length fall on HIM. For notwithstanding all his
   delinquencies, I would still have him avoid, if possible, the
   catastrophe of being ground to powder."

   June, 1848.

LECTURE FIRST.

   ELECTION SHORTLY DEFINED--SHOULD BE CANDIDLY EXAMINED--INVOLVES
   REPROBATION--ULTRA-CALVINISTIC THEORY STATED--QUOTATION FROM JOHN
   CALVIN--FROM DR. R. CANDLISH-CONSISTENCY OF CANDLISH WITH THE
   CONFESSION--THIS THEORY THE SOURCE OF A FALSE AND DANGEROUS PEACE--IT
   CONTRADICTS AND SUBVERTS THE GOSPEL--WHAT IS THE GOSPEL?

   ROM. viii. 33.--"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?"

   EPH. ii. 3.--"In times past, . . . . we were by nature the children of
   wrath, even as others."

   MARK, xvi. 15.--"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
   every creature."

   THE two passages of Scripture which have first been read, refer to the
   same individuals at different stages of their spiritual history. These
   individuals are styled "God's elect") and they are referred to very
   frequently in the Word of God, more especially in the New Testament
   writings. The same idea which is couched under the term "elect," is
   more simply expressed by the word "chosen." Hence we have the statement
   made respecting the individuals referred to, that God the Father "hath
   chosen" them--a statement which occurs in various passages of the
   apostolic epistles. The choice referred to in one and all of the
   passages of Scripture in which the term occurs, is the choice of God,
   and this choice is called by the name of ELECTION. Election, then, may
   be shortly defined, as God's choice, or selection, of certain
   individuals of the human family, to the possession of eternal life.
   That God does, in point of fact, exercise such a choice,--that he does
   make such a selection,--is a plainly revealed, a well accredited
   doctrine of Scripture: There never did exist, and there does not at the
   present day exist, any difference of sentiment upon this fundamental
   point, among those who are agreed in the recognition of the Scriptures
   of the Old and New Testaments, as the infallible word of the infallible
   Jehovah. About this, there is no debate whatever among professing
   Christians. And it is well that, in the very outset of our inquiry into
   this momentous subject, we should be privileged to meet each other upon
   common ground, and to give each other the right hand of fellowship,
   over the recognition of the blessed Bible as the Word of God, and the
   farther recognition of the great fundamental principle, that in the
   salvation of sinners God does exercise a free and sovereign choice.
   Here, then, we are all of one mind, and we may here most appropriately
   breathe forth the united and heartfelt prayer, that we may every one of
   us be guided in our investigations by the Holy Spirit, so that we may
   have grace to act consistently with our common profession. Let the Word
   of God be recognised as the sole and exclusive arbiter in every matter
   of debate. Let the opinions of wise men and good men, which we shall
   have occasion freely and frequently to examine, be brought to the test
   of Scripture; and by that only infallible standard of truth, let them
   be received, or let them be rejected. Let it not be for one moment
   imagined, that any mere man is entitled to the credit of infallibility;
   and far less let it be supposed that in freely and strongly
   disapproving of the sentiments of any man, or any body of men, we are
   thereby treating them with any measure of disrespect, or cherishing for
   our fellow Christians from whom we may differ in sentiment, any feeling
   different from that of Christian affection and esteem. Let it be our
   aim, my brethren, to carry with us into this investigation which lies
   before us, the spirit and the bearing of a free and enlightened
   Christianity; and let me express the hope, that you will, one and all
   of you, candidly and carefully examine what may be set before you from
   this place, and compare it with the Word of God, and receive it, or
   reject it, as you may be satisfied from examination, that it agrees
   with or differs from that infallible record. Finally, here, let me
   remind myself, and remind you, of the apostolic and appropriate
   injunction, "Laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
   and envies, and all evil speakings, as new-born babes, desire the
   sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby" (1 Peter ii. 1, 2).

   In examining the doctrine of Election, we shall include, in our
   investigation, the kindred doctrine of Reprobation. It is impossible
   indeed to look at the one doctrine without at the same time recognising
   the other. They are not so much different doctrines as two different
   aspects of one and the same truth. The one involves the other by
   necessity of nature. The idea of choosing some, implies the idea of
   rejecting others. And though it be a truth, that some writers upon the
   doctrine make an attempt to separate and divide, so as to hold the
   doctrine of election without admitting the opposite doctrine of
   reprobation, it is most evident that they are here not more opposed to
   common sense and Scripture declaration, than they are to John Calvin
   himself. In the twenty-third chapter of the third book of his
   Institutes, Calvin thus expresses himself upon this subject: "Many
   indeed, as though they would drive away the malice from God, do so
   grant election, that they deny that any man is reprobated; but this
   they do too ignorantly and childishly: forasmuch as election itself
   could not stand unless it were set contrary to reprobation; therefore
   whom God passeth over he rejecteth; and for no other cause, but for
   that he will exclude them from the inheritance which he doth
   predestinate to be his children's." Such is the statement of the great
   founder of the system which goes by his name. And we do not see how it
   is possible for any man to admit, that God makes a selection of some
   men from the corrupt mass of humanity, without implying by this
   admission, that God rejects, by the same act, the rest of mankind, and
   thereby consigns them to misery. It is not as if the Deity were
   possessed of mere finite intelligence. It is not as if his omniscience
   could not, and did not, take in at a single glance, the entire
   generations of mankind. It is not as if he were in some danger of
   overlooking a great proportion of his creatures, so that while he
   chooses some, he might possibly pass by the others, without any
   definite or well-ordered design. We submit it as an axiom which may not
   be disputed, that the great God does nothing ignorantly nor
   rashly;--that whatever God does in time, he purposed from eternity to
   do;--and therefore, while we might say of ignorant and short-sighted
   man, that his choice of any given object does not necessarily involve a
   deliberate and final rejection of any other object, which may be placed
   at his disposal, we cannot hazard such an assertion, respecting the
   omniscient and all-wise Jehovah. Short-sighted and fallible mortals
   may, and do exercise the power of choice in reference to many things,
   without any knowledge whatever of, or any mental reference to, other
   objects which lie before them. They may, in other words, choose or
   select, most ignorantly and most rashly. But this will not be said of
   God. And therefore it ought at once to be admitted, that whatever
   proves and establishes any given theory of election, necessarily proves
   and establishes the corresponding theory of reprobation, so that the
   one must, according to the statement of Calvin himself, stand or fall
   with the other, and so, that unless a man be prepared to face up in the
   bold defence of reprobation, he ought to give his theory of election to
   the winds, and turn it adrift as a useless thing.

   What then are the conflicting theories or doctrines of election and
   reprobation which severally claim the reception of men?

   There is, in the first place, that theory which affirms that the whole
   human race come into existence, some of them necessarily and
   irreversibly destined to eternal life--and others of them, necessarily
   and irreversibly bound over to eternal punishment, without any
   reference whatever to their voluntary reception of salvation on the one
   hand, or their voluntary rejection of it on the other. Some infants are
   born into the world without any possibility of coming short of eternal
   felicity. Other infants come into existence without any possibility of
   escaping eternal damnation. And so, men and women come into being, and
   grow up under the government of God, simply and exclusively to meet
   their separate and their final destinies. The elect are born into the
   world, possessed of all the privileges, and entitled to all the
   blessings, of the children of God, seeing that for them only, the Son
   of God shed his blood upon the cross. The reprobate come into existence
   under the curse, which cannot possibly be removed, and which has not
   been removed, seeing that Jesus did not become a curse for them. In
   reference to the one class, it may be said that their salvation is
   unalterably certain, and their perdition as impossible as it is to pull
   down Jesus from his mediatorial throne. In reference to all the rest of
   the human race, it may be said, that their damnation is certain, so
   that it is as sure that they shall perish eternally as that the devils
   are reserved in chains against the judgment of the great day.

   Such is the commonly received doctrine of election on the one hand, and
   of reprobation on the other. This is called the Calvinistic theory,
   because its great originator and patron saint is John Calvin of
   renowned memory; and such is the doctrine which comes first before us
   for examination. It goes under the general name of predestination, and
   it is briefly stated by Calvin in the following words, which we quote
   from section fifth of the twenty-first chapter of the third book of his
   Institutes:--

   "Predestination we call the eternal decree of God, whereby he had it
   determined with himself what he willed to become of every man. For all
   men are not created to like estate: but to some eternal life and to
   some eternal damnation is fore-appointed."

   We crave your especial attention to the emphatic words, "All men are
   not created to like estate,"--implying, as they do imply, the strange
   idea, that some are created,--brought into existence,--for the express
   and definite purpose of damnation, and for no other end whatever. And
   lest any one should imagine that these words, which we have quoted from
   Calvin's writings, embody a sentiment which is now exploded and
   departed from, permit me here to add a quotation from the celebrated
   Dr. Robert Candlish of Edinburgh. I quote from page seventh of the
   doctor's book upon the Atonement,--a book which is universally
   commended by Calvinistic divines. Speaking of the work of the Son of
   God, this writer says--

   "In right of his merit, his service, and his sacrifice, all are given
   into his hands, and all are his. All, therefore, may be said to be
   bought by him, inasmuch as, by his humiliation, obedience, and death,
   he has obtained, as by purchase, a right over all--he has got all under
   his power. But it is for very different purposes and ends. The
   reprobate are his to be judged; the elect are his to be saved. As to
   the former, it is no ransom, or redemption, fairly so called. He has
   won them--bought them, if you will--but it is that he may so dispose of
   them, as to glorify the retributive righteousness of God in their
   condemnation."

   So you will observe that this eminent and influential writer expresses,
   most clearly and distinctly, the idea which Calvin brings out in the
   memorable words already quoted--"All men are not created to like
   estate." They are brought into existence "for very different purposes
   and ends." The tender-hearted mother, as she nurses the infant at her
   breast, and meanwhile listens to the innocent prattle of her firstborn
   as he gambols playfully by her side, is here taught, that in all
   likelihood, these two children have been brought into being for "very
   different purposes and ends." And when she would prayerfully commit
   them both to Christ, and rejoice in the thought that the precious blood
   of the Lamb of God was shed for them, as well as for herself, she is
   told that though it be true that Christ "has bought" them both, it may
   very possibly be "for very different purposes and ends." The younger
   child may, for aught she knows, belong to Christ, only that Jesus may
   acquire the right over that inoffensive babe to condemn it through
   eternity; while the elder may, by a possibility, be purchased for a
   nobler destiny. One thing is certain, that as "all men are not created
   to like estate," and as no atonement has been made for any save the
   elect, should these interesting children not chance to be among the
   chosen number, the mother must make up her mind to thank God for
   bringing them into existence, the heirs of eternal damnation, and
   handing them over to his Son, not that his Son may die for their sins,
   but that he may consign them to a far more aggravated, and still more
   tremendous condemnation, than if he never had died at all.

   Let no one turn round upon the eminent and distinguished man from whom
   I have quoted such sentiments, and impute any measure of blame to him,
   as if he were thereby writing inconsistently with the Confession which
   the people who support him compel him in honesty to teach. The people
   of every Calvinistic church, who do not relish such sentiments, have no
   right or title whatever to complain of their clergy for inculcating
   them. Every man who throws his influence into the scale of a
   Calvinistic church, thereby adds his weight and influence in the
   support and perpetuation of the doctrine I have now stated, be it
   right, or be it wrong. And God forbid that we should quote such
   sentiments for the purpose of pandering to, or in any way excusing, the
   inconsistencies of those who are prepared at once to start back from
   such sentiments, and who nevertheless support their ministers, for the
   express purpose of teaching them and perpetuating them, in full force,
   in the land. The sentiments I have quoted, are the sentiments of an
   honourable and upright man, who consistently expresses, in the
   quotation I have made, the doctrine of the Confession of Faith, which
   the people of Scotland, by their adherence to that Confession, compel
   their ministers to teach.

   That there may exist no mistake upon this subject, let me here quote
   from that venerable Confession. The third chapter of that document
   contains the following words:--

   "(3.) By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some
   men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others
   foreordained to everlasting death.

   "(4.) These angels and men, thus predestinated and foreordained, are
   particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so certain
   and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished.

   "(5.) Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before
   the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and
   immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his
   will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of his mere
   free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or
   perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as
   conditions, or causes moving him thereunto; and all to the praise of
   his glorious grace.

   "(6.) As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the
   eternal and most free purpose of his

   I have quoted enough to serve my purpose, in the present discourse. My
   design is, to set before your minds a clear and distinct statement of
   the theory which we have engaged to examine. I wish you to know what
   that doctrine really is, and to satisfy yourselves, not from my
   statements merely, but from the published statements of Calvinists
   themselves, of the real merits of the system which is all but
   universally received,--the system in which the children of our native
   land are trained up from their infancy, and to oppose or speak against
   which, is the most outrageous heresy. Do not forget, then, I pray you,
   what I have now read from the Confession of Faith. We are informed, in
   the passage last quoted, that every soul of men who is destined to
   perdition, if God so willed it, might be saved. This is not a mere
   inference; it is a direct and explicit assertion, for the passage
   speaks of God withholding his grace, whereby the men, who are destined
   to hell fire, "might have been enlightened in their understandings, and
   wrought upon in their hearts." These words are sufficiently plain and
   definite. The poor men "might have been enlightened" and "wrought
   upon"--they might easily have been saved--but they are deprived, by the
   God who made them, of the very thing which alone was needful to win
   them over to his service, and place them secure in a position of
   holiness and happiness for ever. Let this statement of the Confession
   of Faith be marked down by every man and woman in this assembly. But
   there is more than this to mark down and to remember. We are informed,
   that God Almighty exerts his power for the purpose of entrapping the
   men into positive iniquity. What is it, my friends, that is ascribed to
   our God? He is said not only to withhold what would make men saints,
   "but" (it is expressly added) "sometimes" he "withdraweth the gifts
   which they had, and exposeth them to such objects as their corruption
   makes occasion of sin; and withal, gives them over to their own lusts,
   the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan." This is what our
   holy heavenly Father is said to do, in order to insure the fulfilment
   of his purposes and decrees. Again we call upon you to mark, that it is
   not by a simple negation--a mere refusal to give to the reprobate who
   perish what it is said would be enough to save them--it is more than
   this. It is by an actual, a positive, a direct act of his omnipotence,
   that God is represented as insuring the damnation of his creatures.
   They had gifts, but these gifts God withdraweth from them, lest they
   should happily repent, and before they die, use such gifts for their
   salvation. They were not in the way of sinning with a high hand, but we
   are told, by this most orthodox Confession, that God takes special care
   to expose them to such objects as will infallibly awaken their
   corruption and insure their fall. And, as if it were not enough to give
   them over to their own lusts, and expose them to such worldly
   temptations as God knows will infallibly master them, God is exhibited,
   as handing them over to the power of Satan, in order to make assurance
   doubly sure, and thereby the more readily secure their ultimate
   perdition.

   The statements which have been quoted will suffice as an exhibition of
   the doctrine which we are engaged now in examining. Such quotations
   might easily be multiplied from the published writings of sound and
   orthodox Calvinists, some of which, it many not be unnecessary to refer
   to in the course of farther examination. Meanwhile, it is high time for
   us to pass from the statement of what the doctrine is, to an
   examination of the Scriptural grounds upon which we think it ought to
   be rejected.

   I.--WE OBJECT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, THEN, TO THIS THEORY OF ELECTION,
   BECAUSE IT LEADS UNCONVERTED SINNERS TO SUPPOSE THAT VERY POSSIBLY THEY
   MAY BE SAFE ENOUGH EVEN IN THEIR UNBELIEF.

   The words which are contained in the first of those two texts, to which
   we have referred you in the outset of this discourse, are very plain
   and explicit. The challenge is boldly made--"Who shall lay anything to
   the charge of God's elect?" And it is, as if the apostle had said, that
   it is impossible to lay anything to their charge. They are justified by
   God himself, and no being in the universe of God may venture to condemn
   them. Such is the entire strain of the apostle's unanswerable reasoning
   in the eighth chapter of the Romans, where the passage referred to
   occurs. It is perfectly plain, therefore, at the very first glance of
   this text, that the elect of God, whoever they are and wherever they
   be, are safe. They are secure as in a munition of adamantine rock. "It
   is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth?" But the other
   passage, which we have asked you to turn up in the second chapter of
   the Epistle to the Ephesians, states most plainly, that the elect of
   God, to whom the apostle wrote, and among whom Paul included himself,
   were not always safe. They were not always in a position in which it
   could be said of them, "Who can lay anything to their charge?" They
   were once condemned. They were once the children of wrath even as
   others. They were once in precisely the same position in the sight of
   God, if not in the sight of men, which is occupied by every one of the
   rebellious generations of mankind. There was no difference whatever
   between them and the reprobate, and if they had died while they were
   yet the children of wrath, they must have endured the wrath of God
   throughout a long eternity. The phrase which the apostle uses in
   reference to himself and others of the elect, as descriptive of their
   state previous to their conversion, can scarcely be mistaken,--"The
   children of wrath, even as others." And we appeal to any man, whether
   this expression does not bear us out in the assertion, that between the
   elect and the reprobate there really existed no difference whatever, up
   to the moment when the former believed the gospel, and entered by faith
   into the full possession of all the privileges of the children of God.
   It seems plain, then, that viewing men as unbelievers, they all stand
   upon a common level,--they all occupy the same position,--the position
   of rebels against God, children of wrath, and heirs of hell.

   But the doctrine which we are examining does make a difference among
   sinners of the human family, not only before their conversion, but
   previous to their existence in the world. That doctrine informs us,
   that "all men are not created to like estate." Some come into the world
   the elect children of God, chosen into his family and enrolled among
   the number of his children, ages before they came into being. All the
   rest come into existence "the children of wrath." Now if this be really
   true in reference to the former, the question may be boldly proposed in
   reference to them at any stage of their spiritual history, and during
   the entire course of their unbelief and rebellion--"Who shall lay
   anything to their charge?" The simple question is this--Are they not
   among the number of God's elect? Are they not among the number of those
   for whom alone (it is affirmed) the Saviour shed his blood? On this
   single ground, may the unconverted sinner boldly and presumptuously
   take his stand, and fancy himself safe enough in his sins. Here he may,
   and here, alas! too many actually do lay themselves quietly down to
   rest, saying peace, peace, unto their souls, while God is saying, there
   is no peace; and here, in point of fact, are vast multitudes of men and
   women making shipwreck of their souls, and rushing heedlessly into an
   undone eternity.

   And here the question meets us: Is not such conduct as this the result
   of a most palpable abuse of the doctrine now under examination? If such
   a conclusion as that now indicated, were indeed the effect of the abuse
   and perversion of the doctrine of the Calvinist, this simple fact would
   be enough to turn aside the entire edge of the argument we are now
   pursuing. But this is far from being the case. We have been stating the
   natural and necessary result, not of the abuse of this doctrine, but of
   its use. It needs only to be received into the understanding of any
   man, and believed in as a truth, and consistently followed out, and
   reduced to practice, in order to leave its votaries at ease in the
   midst of their unbelief and their sin. Let any man believe it, and what
   is his argument? He either is, or he is not, one of the elect. If he
   is, he is safe; for who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect?
   If,. on the other hand, he is not one of the elect, he must needs be
   among the number of the reprobate, and on this supposition it is vain
   for him to perplex himself, for who can venture to reverse or to alter
   the course of God's unalterable decree? Will any man undertake to find
   a single flaw in reasoning such as this? It is such reasoning as
   presents itself to every mind, on the simple announcement of the
   doctrine now under examination. It amounts to nothing less than a very
   plain and very simple demonstration. It is a conclusion arising most
   naturally from the doctrine of which we speak, so that any child can
   draw it for himself. And so be it, that a man can be induced to believe
   that "all men are not created to like estate," but come into existence
   either the heirs of heaven on the one hand, or destined to endless
   misery on the other, we do not see that it is possible for the man,
   consistently with his belief, to give himself any concern whatever
   about his soul's salvation. That is a matter settled and arranged, one
   way or another, long before he came into existence, and why should he
   presume to usurp the place of God by intermeddling with his most wise
   and irreversible decree?

   It is only when you turn your attention to the text which we have
   selected from the epistle to the Ephesians, that you will be able to
   discover wherein the palpable fallacy of all such reasoning really
   consists. The fallacy is detected in the premises, and not in the
   conclusion which is deduced therefrom. The foundation is unstable. It
   is a sandy foundation; and hence the erection which is fairly enough
   built upon it, totters and falls before the slightest examination. What
   are the premises from which the false conclusion is legitimately
   drawn--the foundation on which the tottering fabric is fairly enough
   built? This is to be seen in the assertion of John Calvin, that "all
   men are not created to like estate." Here lies the fundamental
   error,--the error which the Spirit of God emphatically contradicts,
   when he informs us that even the elect, before they believe the gospel,
   are ranged among the children of wrath, even as others. So, then, it is
   most evident that they are not the elect children of God before they
   believe. They are the children of wrath, and that is, in other words,
   asserting that they are not the children of God. They cannot be called
   the children of God and the children of the devil at one and the same
   moment of time. They cannot, at one and the same moment, have it truly
   affirmed concerning them, that they "are condemned already, because
   they believe not," and yet that "none can lay anything to their
   charge," because they are God's elected and justified children. The
   plain and unvarnished truth must come out, and stand forth in broad and
   palpable opposition to the assertion of Calvin,--the assertion which
   forms the corner-stone of the entire system which. goes by his name. It
   must be admitted that all men are born to like estate. They are every
   one of them by nature the children of wrath. Jew and Gentile alike, are
   every soul of them concluded under sin and unbelief, and consequent
   condemnation. In their natural condition, and in their state of
   unbelief, there is not one elect child of God among them all. In this
   state, there is no justification to any one soul among them. There is
   laid, and laid justly, to their charge, the most tremendous crime that
   can possibly be laid to the charge of any creature. They are not only
   standing out rebels against God, but they are making God a liar, so
   long as they believe not the record which God hath given of his Son.
   (1st John v. 10, 11.)

   Such is the estate--the condition, in which all men are, without
   exception, placed, before they are actually converted to God.
   Considering them, then, in this condition, what is the estate to which
   they are every moment exposed? They are the children of wrath, and in
   this state they are every hour exposed to the wrath of God and the
   pains of hell for ever. There is but a step between them and death. The
   brittle thread of life, and that alone, suspends every soul of them
   over the pit of endless perdition. In this position it is worse than
   idle--it is false, utterly false, to say that any single sinner differs
   from any other sinner of the human race, by being embraced in an
   absolute or unconditional decree, which insures one unbeliever pf
   heaven, while it destines another unbeliever to hell as his sure and
   irreversible destiny. Let the words of the Son of God be yet once more
   sounded in the ears of every unbelieving sinner--"HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT
   IS CONDEMNED ALREADY." And before these words let the theory perish for
   ever, which would lead any man to suppose, that there are some
   UNBELIEVERS against whom no charge can be justly laid, because they
   happen to be included among God's elect.

   II.--WE OBJECT TO THAT THEORY OF ELECTION NOW UNDER EXAMINATION,
   BECAUSE, IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT FLATLY CONTRADICTS THE SCRIPTURE
   DECLARATION THAT THERE IS IN THE GOSPEL A MESSAGE OF SALVATION TO EVERY
   CREATURE.

   It will surely be admitted that the message of the gospel is addressed
   to all men on the face of the earth. There is no distinction--no
   exception here: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
   every creature." "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
   shall be to all people." These, and such like statements, with which
   the Word of God abounds, are sufficiently plain and intelligible even
   to the simplest understanding. By them, the banner of peace is held out
   to all men. In them, the Holy Spirit is heard addressing the word of
   salvation to all. And what are these, in point of fact, but the precise
   tidings referred to so distinctly and so eloquently in the apocalyptic
   vision, where was seen "another angel flying in the midst of heaven,
   having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
   earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people"? And
   now, my brethren, will you permit me here to pause in order to ask you
   one single question, which you are by this time quite prepared to
   appreciate--What are the good tidings of great joy which the ministers
   of the gospel have to preach to the reprobate, if the system of
   Calvinism be true? This is the simple question, which I beg most
   earnestly to press upon your attention. Does the system now under
   examination admit of any good tidings whatever to those of the human
   family whom, it is said, God has determined beforehand eternally to
   condemn? It is either true, or it is not true, that all men are not
   created to the like estate, but that to some eternal life, and to
   others eternal death, is foreappointed by the immutable fiat of the
   Almighty. If this be true, then let the truth be told, and let it be
   honestly announced to men, that there is no gospel--no good tidings of
   great joy--to be preached to any, save only to the elect. If this be
   true, what is the real state of matters in reference to the great
   proportion of mankind who do not happen to be elected? God has been
   pleased to pass them by, and to include them in his reprobating decree,
   and to bring them into existence for purposes and ends very different
   (to use the words of Dr. Candlish) from those for which he has created
   others, inasmuch as he has sold them to his son, in order that his Son
   may get possession of them, soul and body, for eternal damnation. I
   wonder not, my friends, that a thrill of horror should pass through
   your spirits at the bare and simple repetition of that which we are
   called upon to receive as the truth of God. It is said to be truth; and
   the question is, whether it be good tidings of great joy. Does it not,
   on the contrary, exclude the possibility of any good news from God to
   those who are not elected? It is not like the law, which, though it be
   not the gospel, is useful as a schoolmaster to lead sinners to Christ,
   by showing them their need of a Saviour. It is a schoolmaster this,
   which drives men away from Christ, assuring them, as it does, that
   there is no atonement for them in his death, but that he has bought
   them for no other purpose or end, than to exercise his power in
   tormenting them throughout eternity, unless they are among the number
   of the elect. But you tell me, that this is not the way in which
   Calvinistic preachers speak unto sinners; they preach freely and fully,
   and they assure all men that, whether they be elected or not, they are
   among those to whom the gospel comes, and to whom its overtures are
   most earnestly and sincerely made. But what is the sum and substance of
   all such preaching? What is this but a weekly condemnation of the
   doctrine which we are now examining--a weekly exposure of it as a
   forgery and a lie?

   It is not possible for any man to announce, in a single sentence, a
   more palpable contradiction than what is embodied in the twofold
   announcement--that there is an offer of salvation honestly made to all
   the reprobated sons of men, and that God sincerely wills them to be
   saved, while it is at the same time true that God has created them for
   the single purpose of damnation, so that they must reverse the purpose,
   and annihilate the decree of God, before they can be saved. I
   fearlessly put to you all, whether there be not in such a statement a
   flat and palpable contradiction. What would you say to the man who
   should style himself a father, and protest over the dead body of his
   murdered child, that he desired not and willed not that it should
   die--and who should, at the same instant, point you to the cup of
   sweetened poison which he had put in its way, so that the little one
   might be exposed to a temptation which its corruption was not likely to
   resist, and which the unnatural wretch knew his child would infallibly
   partake of, and drinking of which it sickened and died? And what will
   you say of the system which teaches you and your children to believe,
   that the God of heaven has made a decree from eternity to destroy many
   of you, and, in order to carry out his purpose, keeps back and
   withholds what he knows would save you, and farther, exposes you to
   such objects as he knows will ruin you, and finally gives you over to
   the power of the devil?--what do you think of the system which insists
   upon you swallowing all this as truth, and at the same time turns round
   upon you with a smile and assures you, that there is a sincere offer of
   salvation to you in the gospel, and that God does sincerely desire you
   to be saved? Are we uncharitable when we say, that all this is a mere
   mockery of human wretchedness? Is it wonderful that the men who tell
   you all this, should at the same time assure you, that you cannot
   believe it? The wonder would be if men could believe an announcement
   which is self-contradictory and absurd; and the most marvellous thing
   of all is, that men of common sense should not only tolerate, but
   applaud and support and encourage, by their influence and example, so
   glaring and so monstrous a mockery of all that is sacred and precious
   to souls passing onwards to the judgment-seat of God.

   But we are told, in reply to all this, that, in the first place, men
   have nothing to do with election in preaching the gospel to sinners;
   and, in the second place, that those to whom the gospel comes are not
   supposed to know whether they are among the elect or among the
   reprobate. I crave your attention, very briefly, to this specious
   reply. It is said that they to whom the gospel is preached have nothing
   to do with the doctrine now under examination. I ask, Why then insist
   upon men receiving it? If sinners have nothing to do with it, why place
   it in the forefront of your creed, and compel your very children to
   imbibe it as with their mother's milk? But if it be true, it is not
   right to say that men have nothing to do with it; for if it be true, it
   manifests to all men the startling fact, that there is no gospel at all
   to any save the elect; and if there be no gospel to any save the elect,
   then there should be no preaching to any except the elect, and it would
   ultimately come to this, that there would be no congregations and no
   preachers at all. In this way, "this our craft is in danger to be set
   at nought," and hence it is necessary and expedient to say to men, that
   the doctrine of election is a mystery with which they have nothing
   whatever to do!

   And it does not make matters any better to affirm, in the second place,
   that men cannot say whether they are among the elect or among the
   reprobate. This state of ignorance does not alter the fact, that,
   according to this doctrine, there are no good news whatever to those
   who are not elected. The fact still stands out, that there is no gospel
   to preach to the reprobate. But while the ignorance of men does not,
   and cannot, alter this fact, it renders the preaching of the gospel a
   dead letter even to the elect. For, with the idea in your minds that
   there are many, for example, in this present audience, who cannot
   possibly be saved, because Jesus did not make atonement for you
   all,--and God, for anything you know, has included many of you in the
   decree of condemnation, and brought many of you into existence for the
   express purpose of damnation,--with this idea in your minds, and
   without any means of ascertaining who the persons are who are thus
   excluded from the very possibility of salvation, every soul of you must
   either leave this house careless about the matter, or go away anxiously
   inquiring--"Is it I?--Is it I?"

   In this case, your very ignorance as to whether you are among the elect
   or the reprobate, must needs prevent even the elect among you from
   ascertaining and believing that there is really good news this evening
   announced to you. And hence, alas! it has come to this pass, that under
   the direful influence of the doctrine we have been examining, it has
   become a mere matter of course for whole congregations to come and go,
   week after week and year after year, without any personal appreciation
   of the great salvation on the one hand, or any anxious inquiry after it
   on the other. But whenever any season of refreshing does arrive, and
   the gospel is preached and received with power from on high, sinners
   are called upon to cast away from their minds the ideas of election
   which we have been looking at--to treat them as if they had no
   existence--and simply to believe, each man for himself and each woman
   for herself, the message of the gospel, as addressed personally to
   each. All this is a good confession of the truth of what we now assert,
   when we ask you to reject the doctrine of Calvin and the Confession for
   this reason, that it most glaringly contradicts the Bible, wherein we
   are assured that there is a gospel--a true gospel--glad tidings,
   indeed, to every soul of man, which we are privileged and commanded to
   preach unto you.

   What then shall we say to you, in conclusion, but call upon you to
   receive, without one moment's delay, what the Holy Ghost, speaking
   through his servant Jude, graciously styles "THE COMMON SALVATION."
   There is no restriction expressed in the Word of God, and most
   assuredly there is no restriction implied. The God with whom we have to
   do is not, like the dark genius of Calvinism, a deceitful and a
   deceiving spirit. He is a God of truth, and without iniquity; just and
   right is he. He is not only the just God, but also the Saviour; and in
   this precise character has he revealed himself unto the guilty sons of
   men. "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I
   am God, and besides me there is none else." (Isaiah xlv. 21, 22.) There
   is assuredly a gospel for you all, and this is only another mode of
   assuring you, that no frowning decree intercepts between any of you and
   salvation.

   The glorious gospel which we announce to you, does not indeed say to
   you that you are pardoned and saved, but it comes with such a message
   as this to no single individual on the face of the earth. It does not
   tell any man that he is already pardoned and saved. It proceeds upon an
   assumption the very reverse of all this. It assumes truly that the
   sinners to whom it comes, are already condemned and ruined; and
   assuredly there is nothing indicated thereby, which is either fitted or
   intended to leave any soul among you all, even for a single moment, at
   peace in your sins; but you are thereby assured, that now your sins
   form no reason why any sinner among you should, even for a single
   moment, remain without peace with your God. "Behold the Lamb of God."
   "Behold the Lamb of God bearing away the sin of the world." (John i.
   29, 36.) "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not -for ours only,
   but also for the sins of the whole world." (1 John ii. 2.) This is the
   gospel message to every creature, and it forms the sum and substance of
   the gospel message to you.

   That such is the gospel message, addressed by the Holy Spirit to
   condemned and ruined sinners, and to every sinner condemned and ruined
   on the face of the earth, is abundantly manifest from the Word of God.
   Take one single example from among the multitude of instances which the
   Bible contains. It is written in 1 Cor. xv. 1-4: "Moreover, brethren, I
   declare unto you THE GOSPEL which I preached unto you, which also ye
   have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye
   keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in
   vain: for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
   how that CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS according to the Scriptures; and that
   HE WAS BURIED, AND THAT HE ROSE AGAIN the third day according to the
   Scriptures." Here, then, we have the testimony of Inspiration upon this
   most momentous of all questions. Here we are informed, by the inspired
   apostle himself, what he preached to the heathen Corinthians--"first of
   all," before they believed--when first he made his appearance among
   them as an ambassador of Christ. It was not that Christ died for the
   sins of the elect, or for the sins of believers only. This would have
   been sad news indeed to those poor heathens who were at the time
   unsaved--who were at the time unbelievers--and who must have concluded
   infallibly, from such a message, that seeing they were unbelievers,
   Christ did not shed his blood for them. If Jesus died for believers
   only, and if this was the gospel which Paul preached unto a company of
   heathen unbelievers, when first of all he went among them, you will see
   at once, that such a gospel as this was anything but good news TO THEM.
   It was tantamount to a message of exclusion to every unbeliever in
   whose hearing it was announced--exclusion from the very possibility of
   salvation; for if Jesus did not die for their sins, how could any soul
   among them possibly be saved? They were unbelievers--and to say to them
   first of all, that Christ died for believers, was just to announce the
   very reverse of gospel-it was just to assure them that for their sins
   no atonement had been made, and consequently that for them there
   existed no possibility of escape from the wrath to come. To tell a
   company of unbelievers that Christ died for believers, is assuredly the
   most effectual of all possible devices whereby the poor souls may be
   shut up in their unbelief--shut out from the very possibility of
   believing. It is just another mode of saying to them--"Christ DID NOT
   die for you." But this is "ANOTHER GOSPEL." This is not the gospel
   which Paul declares he was privileged and commanded to preach. His
   first message to those heathen men and heathen women was--"Christ died
   for our sins, and was buried, and rose again the third day, according
   to the Scriptures." This was the gospel which he preached. This was the
   gospel which they received after it was first of all preached unto
   them, and by the faith of which they were saved. "Christ died for our
   sins," said the inspired preacher, and by this saying he assured every
   one of those to whom he spoke, that the blood of the Son of God was
   shed for their sins as well as for the sins qf the man who addressed
   them. There was SOMETHING here for every one of them to believe, and
   that something was--"the gospel"--"good tidings of great joy" to every
   sinner among them. Christ died for you and also for me. "The Son of God
   loved me, and gave himself for me;" but his love encircled you as well
   as me, and he died for your sins as well as for mine. He died for the
   sins of every one of us. "He died FOR OUR SINS, according to the
   Scriptures," and his death has been accepted and acknowledged by God as
   a complete satisfaction for all our guilt. In testimony of this, God
   has raised him from the grave, for "he was buried, and rose again the
   third day according to the Scriptures." Do you not behold here, my
   fellow-sinners, something very different from that undefined and
   indefinable system of mysticism and delusion under which the souls of
   our countrymen have been bound down and shackled, and before which,
   thousands and tens of thousands are daily and hourly perishing? Do you
   not apprehend, in this inspired narrative of what the gospel message
   is, something very plain and very simple and very cheering for you and
   me to believe? It is not that Jesus, when he died, did everything for
   the elect and nothing at all for the reprobate--everything for
   believers and nothing at all for unbelievers--everything for some
   favoured individuals and perhaps nothing for you. That is not what you
   are called upon to believe, for all that is a delusion and a lie.
   Neither is it, that there is in the death of Christ a "special and
   exclusive reference" to the elect, and a more "general reference" to
   the world. This is only another and more specious aspect of the same
   delusion, whereby the credit of a tottering system of theology is
   sought to be upheld at the expense of the souls of men. This is that
   delusion whereby men are instructed to admit, that Jesus died for all,
   and therefore for each, while a bare PERADVENTURE is left behind and
   beneath this gospel-like admission, and whereby no man is informed
   whether the Son of God, by his death upon the cross, made a true and
   proper satisfaction for his sins. In the face of this device, whereby
   every sinner is taught that, in a certain sense, Jesus died for all,
   and therefore for him, the man is still left to doubt and hesitate and
   conjecture and inquire whether he be among the number of those who are
   "specially interested" in the death of the Son of God. You are not,
   therefore, called upon by God to believe that Jesus did something for
   the world and another thing for the elect when he shed his blood upon
   the cross. This general and special-reference device is really a far
   more dangerous, because a far more subtle delusion, than is the
   barefaced falsehood against which we have already guarded you. The
   truth of the gospel is, that Jesus died EQUALLY for all men. He
   satisfied God for the sins of every man as truly and properly as for
   the sins of any man. His love was equal love to all. His death was a
   complete and perfect satisfaction to the law and justice of God for the
   sins of all men, without distinction and without exception. Rejoice, O
   sinner, in the gladsome intelligence, that NOTHING WHATEVER EXCLUSIVE
   OF YOU was done upon the cross when the Saviour of the world exclaimed,
   "IT IS FINISHED, and bowed his head and gave up the ghost!" The
   non-elect as well as the elect-unbelievers as well as believers--have
   an equal interest in the great propitiation. Does this announcement
   startle you?--does it dispose you to inquire, "Has Jesus shed his blood
   in vain"?--or, does it incline you to rush on to the conclusion that,
   on this supposition, all men must needs be pardoned and justified and
   redeemed and saved? Be pleased, then, to mark well the error which lies
   at the foundation of this very prevalent misconception. The error lies
   in confounding the atonement of the Son of God with its saving and
   sanctifying results. The atonement is one thing--the result of the
   atonement is another and a different thing altogether. When the Saviour
   shed his blood upon the cross, the work of atonement was
   finished--ample satisfaction was there and then made for the sins of
   every sinner in whose room and stead the Saviour died--but it is a
   mistake to imagine that there and then every sinner for whom the
   Saviour died was actually pardoned and justified and redeemed and
   sanctified and saved. The death of the Son of God ought not thus to be
   confounded with its multiform and glorious results. This death was the
   propitiation or atonement for sin. But the atonement is not pardon nor
   justification nor redemption nor sanctification nor complete and
   ultimate salvation. The atonement, or the death of Christ, forms THE
   GROUND of pardon and justification and redemption, and all the kindred
   blessings enjoyed by believers; but every man can easily distinguish
   between the ground upon which any blessing is bestowed and the blessing
   itself, even as it is no difficult task for any one of you to see the
   distinction between the foundation and the building which is thereon
   erected. No man doubts that Jesus, by his death, made atonement, for
   example, for the sins of Saul of Tarsus, but few men will affirm, in so
   many words, that Saul of Tarsus was justified and sanctified and saved
   when the Saviour died. [1] But all that Jesus did and suffered--all
   that Jesus by his death actually accomplished for Saul of Tarsus, was
   completely finished upon the cross. The matter of fact is therefore
   easily enough ascertained. The man of whom we speak was neither
   justified nor sanctified till, on his road to Damascus, he was
   graciously brought to believe in Him whom he had, up till that moment,
   so madly persecuted. This simple statement involves no difficult or
   thorny controversy. It is a statement of a fact, which the plainest
   mind can easily substantiate. The man was condemned UNTIL he believed.
   But Jesus died for his sins BEFORE he believed. The atonement was
   finished for him; but still, in the face of that atonement, he was for
   many a long year and day under condemnation,--a child of wrath, even as
   others. Although his sins were atoned for by the death of Christ, Saul
   of Tarsus remained unjustified, unsanctified, unsaved. It is surely
   evident, from this simple fact, that there is a mighty difference
   between the atonement and justification, or sanctification, or
   redemption. But if the death of Christ had indeed been the
   justification of his people--or if it had been the sanctification of
   his people--or, yet once more, if this death had in itself been the
   redemption of his people--it would have followed from all this, that
   Saul of Tarsus would have been justified and sanctified and redeemed
   from the moment that Jesus expired upon the cross. He would have been
   justified and sanctified and redeemed at the very time when he himself
   informs us that he was a child of wrath and an heir of hell. And so
   there would have been no need of the Holy Spirit to lead him to
   believe, and there would be no need of faith as the instrumental cause
   of justification or sanctification or redemption in the case of any
   sinner for whom the Saviour died. It is most evident, from such
   considerations as these, that Christ did not intend, by the act of
   dying alone, to justify or sanctify or redeem one single sinner for
   whom he died. But he did all that he intended to do. He did not die in
   vain. He finished the work given him to do. He made an atonement for
   sin, and thereby he opened up the way through which any, and every
   sinner, might be pardoned, justified, sanctified, redeemed, and
   glorified through the faith of the truth. It is for this reason that
   every blessing is traced to the death of Jesus, as when it is said, for
   example, in Rom. v. 9, that we are "JUSTIFIED BY HIS BLOOD." This
   statement does not contradict the statement in the first verse of the
   same chapter, wherein we are said to be "JUSTIFIED BY FAITH," and we
   are not to infer therefrom that the shedding of the blood of Jesus was
   the actual justification of his people, or that any man among them is
   actually justified before he believes the gospel. And so for the same
   reason Christ is said by his death to have redeemed us from the curse
   of the law, not as if any man is actually redeemed from the curse any
   more than he is actually justified while he remains in unbelief, but
   that the ground, the all-sufficient ground, the only meritorious and
   God-glorifying and law-magnifying ground of our redemption has been
   laid in the obedience unto the death of the Son of God. What then does
   the Holy Spirit do when he would impart saving faith to you, by holding
   up before you the death of Jesus as the propitiation for your sins?
   Does he ask you to believe that you are pardoned already, or that you
   are already justified? His testimony to you implies the very reverse.
   You stand out condemned and lost--on the very brink of eternal
   destruction. This is the faithful testimony of Him who earnestly
   desires you to flee from the wrath to come. But this is only one-half
   of his testimony. He tells you that the great atoning sacrifice, on the
   ground of which you may, this very hour, be pardoned and justified and
   saved, was eighteen hundred years ago offered up for your sins, and not
   only offered up, but accepted by God himself as a complete answer for
   every one of your transgressions. He points you to God, not relentless
   but propitiated, and ready freely to justify you for the sake of what
   his dear Son did and suffered in your room and stead. Think, then, my
   unconverted hearers, of the awful position which YOU DO OCCUPY. You are
   on the brink of hell every moment you remain without a personal
   appreciation of the Saviour as all your own. Think again of the
   position YOU MAY occupy, even in the twinkling of an eye. There is not
   one hair's-breadth between any of you and salvation. The Son of God has
   shed his blood for your every sin, and it needs but THE TURNING OF YOUR
   MIND--the turning of your mind, which, like the lightning's rapid
   glance, can speed in an instant from hell to heaven,--to flee from
   impending wrath, and hide your guilty souls under the covert of your
   Saviour's righteousness. "Repent ye, therefore, and be converted, that
   your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come
   from the presence of the Lord." How long will any of you remain
   careless and at your ease, as if the thunderbolt of impending wrath
   were not hanging over your faithless and Saviour-despising souls! How
   long will others of you labour in vain, to justify yourselves in the
   sight of your God by your unbelieving efforts, as if an ample ground
   for your immediate pardon and justification had not been already
   furnished by the death of Jesus! To remain in your present state of
   mind is to lull yourselves to repose on the brink of a tremendous
   precipice, over which, if once you fall, you shall rise no more for
   ever. To summon up your most serious and devoted efforts to extricate
   your souls from the position which you occupy, is but to insure your
   destruction. Your safety lies not in remaining where you are, and far
   less does it lie in summoning up your energies to move. You are
   stretched upon the very brink of destruction, and the arm of Another
   alone can save you. Already, O sinner, is that arm outstretched. It is
   the right arm of Him who is "MIGHTY TO SAVE." Why, then, should you
   hesitate to trust implicitly in your Saviour's love, or question for a
   moment the perfection or the efficacy of his finished atonement? Why
   should you, on the one hand, endeavour to lull your souls into a fatal
   repose, by greedily imbibing a false and delusive opiate; or vainly
   struggle, on the other hand, to move from your present perilous
   position, by summoning yourselves to some effort of your own? Why not
   at once awake, and open your eyes to a full perception of the awful
   position in which you are actually remaining, and, at the same time,
   behold the gracious Saviour who has stretched out his arm to save you,
   and forthwith intrust your souls implicitly to his hand? I have spoken
   to you of an opiate, the tendency whereof is only to lull your spirits
   into a dangerous repose. That opiate is neither more nor less than the
   fatal error which I have been endeavouring to expose. Let any man
   imagine that when the Saviour died, he actually pardoned, justified, or
   redeemed all for whom he shed his blood, and his every effort will be
   to get himself to believe that he is already pardoned, justified, and
   redeemed, unless, indeed, he can succeed in banishing the subject
   entirely from his mind. I have also spoken to you of an effort to move
   the soul from the perilous position in which every unbeliever is
   placed--an effort which, if successful, is successful only for
   destruction. That effort is also the result of fundamental error on the
   nature of the atonement. Let any man imagine that, though Jesus died
   for his sins, he nevertheless left the man something or other himself
   to do, before he can consistently be pardoned or justified or saved,
   and he will assuredly be induced to pray in unbelief, or to labour in
   unbelief, or to wait on in unbelief, most earnestly desiring to
   perceive some tokens for THE BETTER within his soul or about his life,
   before he will. venture to trust for eternity in the glorious efficacy
   of the great propitiation. On either supposition the soul is lost--lost
   for ever, solely as the result of culpably misunderstanding the gospel
   and "neglecting the great salvation." There exists but one only
   safeguard against such prevalent, and all but universal delusion. That
   safeguard is to be discovered in the Word of God alone, as opposed to
   the erroneous systems of fallible men. In that only infallible record,
   every soul of man is faithfully warned of the awful position in which
   he is positively placed up to the moment of conversion. And in that
   blessed Bible every sinner of the human race is earnestly and
   compassionately directed at once to the converting truth. This is all
   expressed in the simple announcement, "Christ died for our sins, and
   was buried, and rose again the third day." The moment any sinner
   apprehends the true meaning of this one truthful and glorious
   announcement, in its gracious bearing towards his guilty and condemned
   and ruined soul, that moment is he saved. Yet once more then do we
   urge, and entreat, and implore you to "Behold the Lamb of God." He has
   taken away the sin of the world, and assuredly, my dear friends, your
   sins have not been left behind, as an insuperable barrier to your
   immediate escape. They are every one of them away--for ever away. They
   formed part and parcel of that tremendous burden, which pressed down
   the Lord of Glory to the dust of death. For all our sins, and for the
   sins of all amongst us, did the Saviour die, according to the
   Scriptures. But he is no longer in the grave: "He is risen as he said."
   He rose again on the morning of the third day, according to the
   Scriptures; but when he rose again, O sinner, thy sins did not rise
   along with him, to scare thee, even for an instant, from the bosom of
   thy God. O no! Blessed--for ever blessed be his gracious and glorious
   name, that bosom of infinite compassion, even while I speak, upheaves
   with tender emotion, and swells well-nigh to bursting, in the full view
   of thy wretchedness and thy danger. The heart of thy God is filled
   width earnest and sincere longings after thy immediate salvation. Can
   it be, O sinner, that in the full view of all this, you yourself have
   no pity upon your own immortal soul? Or can it be that, in the view of
   all this, you will still hesitate, and doubt, and suspect your
   Saviour's love, as if he were frowning you away from him even now, and
   commanding you with a stern voice to make yourself somewhat more
   comely, before he can receive you? You would "wait till you are
   better!" You would be somewhat more righteous, at least in thine own
   eyes, and then you will venture to assure yourself of acceptance. And
   thus it is, vain man, that thou answerest thy Saviour's tender
   entreaty; and thus it is that thou dost venture to give the lie to his
   gracious declaration, wherein he says, "I came not to call the
   RIGHTEOUS, but SINNERS, to repentance." But thus it is, that you are up
   to this very hour afraid to meet thy God, because, in point of fact,
   thy sinful, unbelieving, doubting soul is unprepared to face him at the
   bar of judgment. Well mayest thou tremble at the thought of death,
   judgment, and eternity, seeing that thou wilt not tremble at the
   thought of casting behind thee this thy day of gracious, merciful
   visitation; trampling under foot thy Saviour's blood; wasting thy hour
   of grace in thoughtless carelessness, or laborious self-righteousness,
   or damning doubts. Would to God, sinner, that those salutary fears of
   thine would rise into a hurricane of anxiety and alarm, and, ere it be
   too late, shiver into atoms that false refuge under which you actually
   manage to lull your soul to temporary repose. Would to God that you
   were driven from every lying refuge, under which thousands of sober,
   serious professors are saying, "Peace, peace," and were led to betake
   thyself at once to the only refuge which can shield thee from the
   coming storm, the only covert which can shelter thee from the
   approaching tempest. Abandon, then, we earnestly beseech you, the false
   and unscriptural theology--the thing which men call gospel--all of
   which any man may believe, and yet have no solid peace in the prospect
   of meeting God,--all of which a man may believe, and yet doubt his
   soul's salvation,--all of which a man may believe, and yet remain
   unsaved. Bring this soul-destroying delusion to the touchstone of the
   Bible. Compare it with the glorious gospel which Paul preached, and
   behold the contrast!


   "O! how unlike the complex works of man,

   Heaven's easy, artless, unencumber'd plan;

   No meretricious graces to beguile,

   No clustering ornaments to clog the pile;

   From ostentation as from weakness free,

   It stands, like the cerulean arch we see,

   Majestic in its own simplicity.

   Inscribed above the portal from afar,

   Conspicuous as the brightness of a star,

   Legible only by the light they give,

   Stand the soul-quickening words--BELIEVE AND LIVE."

   [1] It is remarkable that even Dr. A. MARSHALL, of Kirkintilloch,
   should affirm the death of Christ to be, in itself, "THE REDEMPTION of
   his people." But here lies the fundamental error of the Calvinistic
   system.

LECTURE SECOND.

   THE CALVINIAN DOCTRINE OPPOSED TO REASON--SUBVERSIVE OF FREE GRACE IN
   THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE BELIEVER--QUOTATION FROM DR. PAYNE AND ANDREW
   FULLER--CALVINISM ALLIED TO SOCINIANISM--CONCLUDING REMARKS.

   EPHES. ii. 5:--"By grace ye are saved."

   BEFORE resuming our consideration of the doctrine of election, as that
   doctrine is exhibited in Calvinistic creeds, we would here solicit your
   attention to a very plain and a very important distinction. We refer to
   the distinction which obtains between what is above reason, and what is
   contrary to reason. There is very much connected with almost every
   subject of human investigation, which is admittedly beyond the reach of
   human reason. There are heights which the human imagination in its
   loftiest soarings cannot reach; there are depths which the soundings of
   the human intellect cannot fathom; there is a length and a breadth
   across which the mind of man has never dared to travel--a boundless
   region, in the immensity which stretches out before the research of the
   human soul, which it is impossible for man in the present stage of his
   existence to examine and explore. It is plain, therefore, that "here we
   see through a glass darkly," and "know only in part," so that there are
   many things we cannot fully understand, which it is our duty
   nevertheless to believe on the simple authority of God. We may specify,
   by way of example, the doctrine of the trinity in unity--three persons
   and yet one God--a plain and manifest truth revealed by God for the
   belief of man. This is an example of a doctrine which is above reason,
   but which, when properly explained as it is announced in the
   Scriptures, is in no way contrary to reason. It involves no
   contradiction. It lands us in no glaring or palpable absurdity. The
   reception of it as a truth, forces us to contradict and explain away
   not one solitary declaration contained within the ample range of the
   revealed word. Thus it is with many doctrines which we receive without
   any hesitation. For reason herself chimes in here with the voice of
   revelation, and it is fully consistent with the dictates of the
   soundest philosophy, to receive with the docility of a little child
   whatever is contained in the Word of God, even though the doctrine
   should be to us enshrouded in a cloud of mystery. The clearly
   ascertained and well accredited statements of the Word of God are to be
   received without any debate, as so many facts; And the soundest
   philosophy and the strongest common sense demand, in behalf of a
   clearly ascertained fact, the profoundest homage of the soul. A well
   accredited fact instantly takes the place of an axiom, to dispute
   which, or to argue inconsistently with which, is to be guilty of a most
   flagrant sin against the highest reason, and to subvert the foundations
   of truth. It matters not whether a man can account for it or not,--if
   it be a thing which is ascertained to be a fact, it must be received.
   It matters not whether we can explain it or not--there it is, standing
   out before our eyes an undisputed fact, and by that every theory must
   be tested, and stand or fall as it agrees with, or differs from, what
   is thus ascertained to be verily true.

   We ought therefore every one of us to understand, that if the theory
   now under examination were merely above reason, this would not form of
   itself any just ground for its rejection. If it were a doctrine
   admittedly and indisputably revealed in the Word of God, that simple
   circumstance would be itself sufficient to demand and to secure its
   immediate reception by every man amongst us, however strange or
   mysterious the doctrine might appear, In this case all that could be
   said of it would be, that it is above reason, but that would really be
   saying nothing whatever which would prejudice a single reasonable man
   against its reception as a doctrine from God, and according to
   godliness.

   The case would be entirely altered if it could be affirmed of any
   doctrine, that it is contrary to reason. Such, for example, is the
   Popish doctrine of transubstantiation. It is contrary to reason to
   dispute the evidence of our senses, and when the Papist informs us that
   the bread and the wine at the Supper of the Lord are not bread and
   wine, but form part and parcel of the real body and blood of Christ, it
   would be absurd to believe it, because our senses inform us of the very
   reverse. Now, it is no less contrary to reason to admit any theory to
   be true, which plainly contradicts some of the most obvious truths
   which the Word of God contains. As we have already noticed, whatever is
   plainly revealed in the Bible must be received as truth; and should any
   doctrine be brought before us which is manifestly inconsistent with
   anything which is thus plainly revealed, that doctrine would thereby
   stand out detected and exposed as an imposition and a falsehood.

   It will be readily admitted by you all, that the Bible is not, and
   cannot be, in one single item really and truly inconsistent with
   itself. To suppose the reverse of this--to suppose that in any one
   point there exists any contradiction or inconsistency in the
   Scriptures, amounts to nothing less than a rejection of them, as the
   infallible record of the infallible God. But you will remember that, in
   the outset of this investigation, we stated it distinctly as one of
   those principles which we take to be admitted on all hands, that the
   Bible is indeed the book of God. We are not now engaged in a discussion
   with men who deny this fundamental point. And admitting, as we presume
   you all do, that this blessed volume is indeed a message from God to
   man, we now solemnly and affectionately call upon you to act reasonably
   and consistently with this admission, and to reject, without any
   hesitation, whatever doctrine is seen by you to be evidently opposed to
   some of the most obvious statements of divine revelation.

   You will require to keep steadily before your minds what the doctrine
   is, which we are engaged in examining. As that doctrine is briefly
   stated by its founder, John Calvin, himself, it asserts that "all men
   are not created to like estate"--some of the human race, according to
   this brief and emphatic statement, coming into existence elect infants,
   unconditionally and irreversibly destined to eternal happiness; all the
   rest of mankind coming into existence, unconditionally doomed to
   everlasting damnation. The former class are accordingly represented as
   being exclusively interested in the death of the Son of God, viewing
   that sacrifice as a propitiation or atonement for sin. All the rest of
   mankind, excepting the elect, having no interest whatever in the
   atonement or death of Christ, are said by this theology to belong to
   Christ for no other end or purpose than that he may exercise his power
   in consigning them to damnation. You will remember that we have been
   careful not to misstate or to exaggerate the doctrine which we have
   engaged to examine, and therefore we have quoted at some length the
   very words of the most respectable and distinguished of its supporters,
   not forgetting to set before you the words of the Confession of Faith,
   wherein it is found. The words of the most eminent man, perhaps, among
   the modern advocates of the doctrine, are no less clear and decisive
   than those of Calvin himself; Dr. Candlish having very lately published
   the statement, that the reprobate belong to Christ to be judged or
   condemned, while the elect are his to be saved. The language of this
   modern Calvinist is, as we have seen at length in the former lecture,
   very emphatic upon the point. He speaks of the death of Christ, and he
   declares it to be no atonement, no ransom properly so called for the
   great majority of mankind, viz., the reprobate. The words of Dr.
   Candlish, as you will remember, are the following, in reference to all
   men, women, and children excepting the elect:--"He [Christ] has won
   them--bought them, if you will--but it is that he may so dispose of
   them as to glorify the retributive righteousness of God in their
   condemnation."

   So far then as our argument has been laid before you for consideration,
   we have endeavoured to prove that this doctrine is diametrically
   opposed to two of the plainest principles of God's most holy Word.

   It is perfectly plain, from the whole tenor of the Word of God, that no
   man is safe for one moment while he remains in unbelief. This we affirm
   to be one of the most obvious of all the principles or truths exhibited
   in the Bible. And inasmuch as the doctrine of election exhibited by
   Calvin, Candlish, and the Confession seems to be directly opposed to
   this plainly revealed principle of God's Word, we have spoken of it as
   not only false, but ruinous and destructive to the souls of men.

   It is still farther evident from the Word of God, that the gospel
   contains good tidings of great joy to every creature, so that there
   does not now exist, and there never did exist, and there never can
   exist, one single sinner on the face of the earth to whom a message of
   salvation is not therein exhibited. But the doctrine of Calvin directly
   contradicts this plain and obvious fact, and is once more proved to be
   unscriptural and false.

   III. THE THIRD OBJECTION WHICH I NOW STATE TO THIS DOCTRINE IS, THAT IT
   IS SUBVERSIVE OF THE BIBLE PRINCIPLE OF SALVATION BY FREE GRACE.

   If there be one truth more plainly revealed in the Word of God than
   another, it is the principle of grace--free grace, in the salvation of
   all who believe. "By grace ye are saved." The assertion of this great
   truth constituted the sum and substance of apostolic preaching. This
   was the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the ending of all their
   sermons. This was the great and glorious announcement around which all
   their arguments and persuasions revolved, as round a centre of light
   and love. This was the burden of all their inspired epistles to the
   various churches over which they sedulously and carefully watched, even
   as they who were to give an account. "By grace ye are saved, through
   faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works,
   lest any man should boast." This was the truth in which they gloried,
   and for any man to subvert, or even to depreciate the great doctrine of
   salvation by free grace, was to aim a deadly thrust at the very heart
   of the glorious gospel of the grace of God.

   And as it was in ancient times, so it is now, and so it will ever be.
   The grand characteristic of the Bible is, that it is a revelation of
   grace. This is the most striking feature of the blessed gospel; and it
   is mainly because the doctrine which we are now examining, is a direct
   and impious subversion of the grace of God in the salvation of the
   sinner, that it eats out the very vitals of the gospel in our beloved
   land.

   We are anxious in this place not to be misunderstood. We do not say
   that this theory of the Calvinist is inconsistent with the grace of God
   in the provision of the atonement. We affirm its utter inconsistency
   with the manifestation of grace, in the justification and subsequent
   salvation of the believer. This circumstance has already induced many
   distinguished Calvinists to make an attempt so far to modify their
   system of theology, as to make a voluntary surrender of the main
   position in defence of which the late work of Dr. Candlish was written
   and published. Some of the most eminent and pious of the Calvinistic
   clergy have already very candidly admitted the truth and force of the
   grave accusation we have now made against the system; and, in
   consistency with this admission, they have very conclusively argued in
   favour of the great and glorious truth, that Jesus died for all men,
   and by his death made satisfaction for the sins of the entire human
   race without one single exception. We shall, in due time, point out to
   you the inconsistency of this important admission with those Calvinian
   tenets which such authors still retain. In the meantime, we make the
   two following quotations from the published works of avowed Calvinists,
   in order to show you, that the very grave objection now adduced against
   the theory we are examining, is candidly admitted even by men of most
   orthodox repute.

   The theory of an atonement for the elect alone has been rejected by Dr.
   Wardlaw, on account of "ITS EXCLUDING EVERY THING OF THE NATURE OF
   GRACE from every part of the process of the sinner's salvation,
   excepting the original appointment of the surety, whose payment, in
   each case, of the estimated debt, cancels the bond, and renders the
   liberation of the debtor not gracious but obligatory."--Discourses on
   the Atonement, p. 63.

   The same objection has been urged against the theory by Dr. George
   Payne of Exeter, in his Ninth Lecture on Sovereignty, &c. At page 148
   of his book, this writer observes:--

   "1st, That it renders the deliverance of the elect from punishment a
   matter of justice to them. They may claim it as a right. It is, in this
   point of view, as if the atonement were the payment of a pecuniary
   debt, and is not less incompatible with the notion that grace is
   exercised in the pardon of sin. There may, indeed, consistently with
   this opinion, have been grace in the acceptance and in the provision of
   a substitute; but surely, if that substitute endured the precise amount
   of punishment which the strong arm of the law would have otherwise laid
   upon those whom he represented, there can be no grace in remitting it
   afterwards to them."

   In concert with the two distinguished writers from whom we have now
   quoted, we would raise our testimony against the doctrine of an
   election of some men only to an exclusive interest in the death of the
   Son of God; and this we do for the most valid of all reasons,--it is
   subversive of the grace of God in the justification of believers. What
   is grace? It is free, unmerited favour; it is unconstrained, voluntary,
   generous love to those who might justly be condemned. That alone is
   grace. If it be constrained, it is not grace. If it be merited, it is
   not grace. If it may not righteously and justly be withheld, it is not
   grace.

   And what is the all but unanimous voice of Calvinistic Scotland? It is
   that God is bound in justice to save all the elect. Mark it well, my
   beloved brethren, God is said to be bound in justice to save every soul
   of man who enters the paradise above. I put it to yourselves if this be
   not the all but universal shout which proceeds from the hosts of the
   orthodox when they would act valiantly, and buckle on their armour to
   do battle against an imaginary heresy. Is not this the universal
   cry--the watchword of the party:--"Jesus did not, could not, die for
   all men; for, if he did, then all men would infallibly be saved"? And
   why? Wherefore is it said to follow, as an obvious conclusion, that all
   men must be saved if Jesus did (as we say he did) give himself, and
   shed his precious blood, a ransom for all? The answer is at hand, and
   it is this: "Because God is bound in justice to save all for whom the
   Saviour shed his blood, and he would act unjustly if he did not save
   them."

   Where, then, I ask, is the GRACE of God in their salvation? If God is
   bound in justice to save those whom he does save, is there a man or
   woman in this audience who does not see at once the obvious and
   palpable conclusion? The inevitable conclusion is, that they are
   indebted not to grace, but to justice, for their salvation. If any one
   among you is bound in justice to act in a certain way, and if you would
   be chargeable with injustice were you to refuse so to act, who would
   think of praising or extolling your generosity when the deed was done?
   In this case, it is surely evident to you all, that you would be placed
   under a necessity of acting, so that no thanks to you for granting what
   you dare not honestly and justly und righteously withhold. Will any man
   deny that if you were my debtor, and if your debt is paid--if the
   uttermost farthing has been wrung from you--and if I seek, in the face
   of this, to lay bold of you, in order to imprison you for the debt, you
   are in a position to defy me to my face? And what would you think of
   me, and what would you not say of me, if I were seeking to take credit
   to myself for most wonderful generosity and grace, simply because I did
   not throw you into prison? You see at once, from this simple case, that
   what I am bound in justice to do, so that I would act unjustly if I did
   not do it, ceases, for that plain and obvious reason, to be an act of
   grace. The principle is not altered by making the supposition that the
   debt is paid, not by you but by your cautioner. The simple question
   between you and me is this: "Is the debt discharged, or is it not?" If
   it be discharged, then I am bound in justice to set you free from all
   farther obligation. If the debt be not discharged, and you come to me,
   saying, "Forgive me my debt," the fact of your asking a free
   forgiveness of it is, on your part, an acknowledgment that you are
   dependent upon my grace, and cannot--dare not--appeal to my justice for
   the discharge. If you say, "Forgive me my debts," and I freely forgive
   you all, though in justice I be not bound to forgive you aught, then,
   and then only, may I speak of grace.

   Let this very obvious principle be applied to the case in hand. We may
   very easily perceive, from the principles of the false and unscriptural
   theology of the day, that the grace of God in saving the sinner is
   thereby denied and subverted. The system of Calvin, Candlish, and the
   Confession, speaks plainly out upon this head. It says in plain and
   express and definite words, that God cannot, without. the most glaring
   injustice, lay a condemning hand upon one soul of the elect. The elect,
   accordingly, may defy God to condemn them. They are, according to this
   theory, in a position to march up to the gate of heaven and demand
   admission. They have no need to say to God, "Father, forgive us our
   debts;" they have only to remind him that he dare not exact them
   without acting unjustly, and thereby shaking the pillars of his
   government and subverting the foundations of his throne. If they were
   to say, "forgive us our debts," they would thereby recede from the
   claim of justice, and fall back upon the acknowledgment of grace. But
   this they cannot do without casting their doctrine of election to the
   winds; for that doctrine teaches them, that their sins do not need to
   be forgiven, seeing that these same sins are imagined to be real,
   literal debts, which were eighteen hundred years ago most fully
   discharged; and therefore, as an act of common justice, cannot now be
   brought up against them!

   May I not here, my friends, most earnestly and solemnly press upon your
   attention the simple but very striking fact, that our blessed Saviour
   has taught all who will take HIM as their teacher, daily and hourly to
   pray, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors"? Are you taught
   by Jesus himself to suppose that sin is a literal debt, so that God is
   by his death bound in justice to forgive you? Does HE teach you that
   your heavenly Father would act unjustly by you if he did not pardon
   your iniquities? No verily. The forgiveness which, for Christ's sake,
   is free to all--proclaimed in the gospel to all--pressed most earnestly
   and sincerely upon the acceptance of all--is not an act of justice but
   an act of grace. And when our Saviour taught and encouraged his
   disciples daily to pray for it, and daily to appropriate the blessing
   as their own he sent them, not to a throne of justice, but to the
   throne of grace. And, in this very prayer, the greatest and best of
   teachers most emphatically contradicts and condemns the theory, that
   God would act unjustly if he did not justify every sinner for whom he
   died.

   There is one other consideration, which I beg, in this connexion, to
   submit to your attention. If it would be unjust in God to condemn any
   (for whom Jesus died) in eternity, it would be no less unjust to
   condemn them in time. If the death of his Son has secured immunity for
   all for whom he died, in a future world, so that it would be unjust in
   God to condemn them there, it must have secured the same thing for them
   in this present world, so that it is no less unjust for him to condemn
   them here, while they are yet upon the earth. You will notice, what we
   are called upon to believe, by this doctrine which we are examining. We
   are called upon to believe, that it would be unjust in God to condemn
   the elect, simply and exclusively because Jesus bore the condemnation
   in their room and stead. Now, the simple question to be solved, is a
   question relating to a matter of fact. Does God not, in point of fact,
   condemn those for whom the Saviour died? If it would be unjust in God
   to condemn them because Jesus died for them, we may rest assured that
   they would never be condemned during any single stage or period of
   their existence. But it is a fact which cannot be denied, that even the
   elect are condemned before they believe. It cannot, therefore, be
   inconsistent with the justice of God to condemn sinners even though
   Christ has borne the punishment of their sins. If it would be unjust in
   God to condemn those for whom Christ died, how comes it to pass that in
   the face of the death of their substitute, they are at any time the
   children of wrath even as others? It will not be asserted that the mere
   circumstance of time or place can alter the nature of justice. Neither
   will it be asserted, that the mere circumstance of a sinner believing
   or not believing, can make that act of God an act of justice to-day
   which to-morrow would be most glaringly unjust. Take the case of a
   debtor and his creditor, as an illustration of this principle to which
   we now advert. If the creditor is satisfied by having received ample
   payment, it would be unjust in him to imprison his debtor during the
   whole period of his natural life. This would be an act of the most
   palpable injustice. But would the act of imprisonment become an act of
   justice if the debtor were, in the face of the payment, sent to prison
   even for a single hour? You can, every one of you, understand this, so
   as to affirm, without hesitation, that the circumstance of time does
   not change the moral character of the act. If it is right to condemn
   and imprison the man for one hour, it is not wrong, in the face of the
   payment, to condemn and imprison him for life; and, contrariwise, if it
   be wrong, in the face of the payment of the debt, to condemn and
   imprison him during life, it does not become right when the period of
   condemnation is indefinitely shortened. The injustice consists in the
   act of condemnation and imprisonment in the face of the payment, and
   not in the time during which the man has been sent to prison, or the
   place where he has been confined.

   Let this illustration be applied to the case before us. It is said that
   God is bound in justice to justify all those for whom Christ died, and
   that he would act unjustly if he were to condemn them. The question is,
   Does he never condemn them? The question is not, Where does he condemn?
   or, How long does he condemn? The simple question which I press upon
   your notice is, Does God never at any time condemn them, in the face of
   the fact, that his Son has met the condemnation in their room and
   stead? Listen to what Jesus says, "He that believeth not is condemned
   already." It cannot, therefore, be unjust in God to condemn those for
   whom Christ has died. And hence it follows, as an inevitable
   conclusion, that their justification is not an act of justice but an
   act of grace.

   What then becomes of John Calvin's doctrine of election? That doctrine,
   as we have seen, is based upon the assumption, that it is unjust in
   God, under any circumstances, to condemn any for whom the Saviour died.
   I appeal from Calvin and Candlish and the Confession of Faith, to the
   Word of God; and I ask you, with your Bibles, and the judgment-seat of
   God before you, solemnly to say, whether the doctrine, now under
   review, be not opposed to the word of truth and totally subversive of
   the grace of God in the salvation of the sinner.

   But this is not all the mischief which results from the error now under
   consideration. That theory of election not only subverts the doctrine
   of free grace, it makes Jesus Christ himself the great agent in the
   overthrow. By this, the death of the Son of God is represented as
   instrumental in robbing the Father of his glory in the salvation of
   man. It is said that the sacrifice of his Son has rendered it
   imperative upon the Father to save certain sinners of the human race.
   This is an obligation binding upon God, in consequence of the
   atonement. Had Jesus not shed his blood for them, God would not have
   been bound in justice to save those sinners for whom he died. But now
   that his Son has died, it would be unjust in God to condemn them. This
   is what many people are taught to believe. Let us see to what an awful
   conclusion this statement conducts us.

   It lands us at once in the conclusion, that by his atoning sacrifice,
   Jesus Christ has rendered it impossible for God to exercise grace in
   the justification of the sinner who believes. You will observe again,
   that we restrict our observation to the act of God in justifying the
   ungodly. We are not speaking of the previous act of God in giving up
   his Son to die, for it is but justice to those from whom we differ
   again to remind you, that their doctrine is free from the charge now
   advanced against it, if we confine ourselves merely to the act of the
   Father in giving up his Son to die for sinners. Our friends, from whom
   we differ, do not deny the grace of God in the primary act, of giving
   up his Son even to the death--the cursed death of the cross. They
   admit, and constantly do they affirm, that there is here the most
   wonderful manifestation of free grace the universe ever witnessed. And
   they are ever forward to make this most important and truthful
   concession. But you are not to permit your minds to be led off from the
   point now before us, by this admission on the part of Calvinists,
   important as it is. There is a difference between the act of God in
   sending his Son, and the act of God in justifying the ungodly who
   believe. The two acts of God are separate and distinct. The Son was
   sent into the world eighteen hundred years ago. The sinner who trusts
   to the sacrifice of the Son is not justified until he believes. You
   will observe, therefore, what is the precise charge which we adduce
   against that theory of election which restricts the death of Christ to
   the elect and to them alone. We affirm, that while it does not fail to
   exhibit the grace of God in the gift of his Son, it destroys the grace
   of God in the justification and salvation of the sinner; and, more
   especially, it exhibits the very sacrifice of the Son of God as that
   which renders it utterly impossible for God to exercise grace in the
   act of justification. If justification be of debt, it is no more of
   grace, otherwise debt is no more debt,--and if it be of grace, it is no
   more of debt, otherwise grace is no more grace. It matters not to whom
   it is affirmed, that God is bound, or to whom he is so indebted as to
   be compelled, in justice, to justify any sinner, be that sinner who he
   may. It matters not, though it should be said, as said it is, that God
   is bound or indebted, not as an act of justice to the sinner, but as an
   act of justice to his Son, to justify every sinner for whom he died.
   The merest child will perceive that this attempt to escape the dreadful
   conclusion is a mere evasion. For the question before us is not--to
   whom is God the Father bound. The simple query before us relates to the
   plain matter of fact--Is God bound, or is he free, to justify? If he be
   bound so that it would be unjust in him to condemn the sinner, it does
   not meet, but rather evades and jinks the difficulty, to turn our
   attention to the statement, that it is to his own Son that God is
   bound. Nothing can be more evident than this, that whether it be the
   sinner himself who has brought God under a debt of justice, or whether
   it be the sinner's substitute who has brought God under a debt of
   justice to justify the ungodly, the matter of fact is not thereby
   altered, but remains unchangeably the same, that on either supposition
   it is not justification by free grace, but justification as an act of
   common and ordinary justice which this notion of election ascribes to
   God the Father. What would you do, if any of you were owing me a debt
   of one thousand pounds, in order to destroy the possibility of any
   exercise of grace on my part? You would pay down the money. You would
   count it over to the uttermost farthing, and you would thereby evince
   your determination to put it out of my power to show you any favour--to
   exercise toward you any grace. And if you could not pay me yourself, in
   what other way could I be prevented from exercising toward you the
   slightest particle of grace? Your cautioner would pay down the money
   and forthwith demand your discharge. In this case, indeed, I would be
   shut up to the exercise of justice, but just for that, reason would I
   be shut out from the barest possibility of exercising the prerogative
   of grace. The man would rob me of the honour or the glory of free grace
   by the self-same act, whereby he should constrain me to give you a
   discharge as an act of common honesty and ordinary justice.

   Now it is precisely in this way that the Calvinian theory of election
   represents the Son of God as, by his very death, robbing his Father of
   the glory of his grace in the act of justifying the sinner who
   believes. It represents the Son as placing God under an obligation of
   strict justice thus to act. According to this, Jesus by his death left
   no room or scope whatever for the exercise of grace in the matter of
   justification. He thereby rendered the exercise of grace a natural and
   total impossibility. Such a representation, or rather
   misrepresentation, of the death of the Son of God, ought to be
   rejected, therefore, on account of "its excluding"--to quote again the
   well chosen words of the venerable Dr. Wardlaw--"everything of the
   nature of grace from every part of the process of the sinner's
   salvation excepting the original appointment of the surety, whose
   payment in each case of the estimated debt cancels the bond, and
   renders the liberation of the debtor not gracious but obligatory." Such
   is our deliberate assertion in reference to the scheme of doctrine now
   under examination. It is a tremendous charge which id substantiated
   against it, that it excludes everything of the nature of grace, and
   renders the justification of the sinner not gracious but obligatory.

   And what renders the blasphemy more striking is the fact to which we
   now particularly advert. It represents the blessed atonement as putting
   an extinguisher upon the most glorious manifestation of the divine
   character. It exhibits the Son of God as playing the part of an
   unnatural Absalom, and tearing rudely from his father's crown the
   brightest gem which sparkles there. How widely different from all this
   is the real state of matters as exhibited in the Bible! Here we learn,
   that it was to honour his Father that the Son of God came down to earth
   upon his bloody and merciful errand. He came--not to destroy the
   possibility of his Father exercising the glorious prerogative of grace,
   but to open up a way for its wide and consistent manifestation. He
   came--not to shroud the free grace of God in everlasting gloom (a gloom
   illumined by no other manifestation save the fiery flash of justice),
   but to take away the covering which, but for his death, must ever have
   intervened between the grace of God and sinful man. He came--not to
   force a God of justice to save, but to leave God at liberty to save,
   without the slightest violation of one solitary principle of his
   righteous and just administration. He came--not for the purpose of
   fixing down upon his Father's character the charge of injustice, should
   his Father not extend to sinners the sceptre of mercy, and hold out the
   olive branch of peace--but to clear at once and for ever the injured
   and maligned reputation of God, by causing grace to walk forth over the
   sinful world (which the foul calumniator of God had said God did not
   love) in glorious harmony with justice and righteousness and truth. He
   came--not to make God out to be an unjust God if he should in any case
   not be received as a Saviour, but to exhibit God as a just God and yet
   a Saviour. He came--not to exhibit truth at the expense of mercy, nor
   righteousness at the expense of peace, but at his coming, and around
   his cross, "Mercy and truth met together, righteousness and peace
   embraced each other." In one single word, the death of Jesus did not
   render it imperative on God to save one sinner of the race. What then
   did it do? It rendered it consistent with the justice of God to save
   all who believe. In this way the blessed atonement did not destroy
   grace, but on the contrary it opened up a channel for its consistent
   exercise, so that now the whole world is under its benignant reign. And
   thus it is abundantly manifest, that while the coffin and the funeral
   and the grave-yard proclaim through all the earth, in the ears of all
   earth's generations, that "sin hath reigned unto death"--the rain and
   the sunlight and the healthful breeze, and above all, the lively hope
   of a blissful immortality, proclaim aloud to all, that "grace hath
   reigned through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our
   Lord."

   "Sin is frequently described as a debt (remarks Dr. Payne), and the
   atonement as the payment of this debt; and if we were careful to
   recollect that these are symbolical or figurative terms, we should not
   be misled by the phraseology. But the misfortune is, that words which
   are really figurative, and which are employed for the sole purpose of
   illustration, have been understood and explained literally. Sin has
   been represented as a real debt, and the atonement as a real payment of
   that debt; and the unhappy result is, that darkness of the densest kind
   has been made to envelope the whole subject. There are individuals who
   imagine that Christ rescues his people from the claims of divine
   justice in precisely the same way in which a generous friend delivers a
   debtor from captivity, by advancing the necessary sum in his behalf.
   Now I would not affirm that it is impossible for such persons to be
   saved by an humble hope in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ; but I
   can have no hesitation in expressing the opinion, that they do not
   understand the atonement. [2] A pecuniary satisfaction, and a moral
   satisfaction differ essentially in their nature, and proceed on
   radically different principles. Perhaps no man has set this difference
   in a clearer light than the late Mr. Fuller, whose words I quote:--I
   apprehend,' says this excellent writer, 'that very important mistakes
   have arisen from considering the interposition of Christ under the
   notion of paying a debt. The blood of Christ is, indeed, the price of
   our redemption, or that for the sake of which we are delivered from the
   curse of the law; but this metaphorical language, as well as that of
   head and members, may be carried too far, and may lead us into many
   errors. In cases of debt and credit among men, when a surety undertakes
   to represent the debtor, from the moment his undertaking is accepted,
   the debtor is free, and may obtain his liberty, not as a matter of
   favour, at least on the part of the creditor, but of strict justice.'
   But who in his sober senses will imagine this to be analogous to the
   redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ? Sin is a debt only in a
   metaphorical sense; properly speaking, it is a crime, and satisfaction
   for it requires to be made, not on pecuniary, but on moral principles.
   If Philemon had accepted of that part of Paul's offer which respected
   property, and had placed so much of it to his account as he considered
   Onesimus to have owed him, he could not have been said to have remitted
   his debt, nor would Onesimus have had to thank him for remitting it.
   But it is supposed of Onesimus, that he might not only be in debt to
   his master, but have wronged him. Perhaps he had embezzled his goods,
   corrupted his children, or injured his character. Now, for Philemon to
   accept that part of the offer were very different from the other. In
   the one case, he would have accepted of a pecuniary representative; in
   the other, of a moral one; i. e., of a mediator. The satisfaction, in
   the one case, would annihilate the very idea of remission; but not in
   the other. Whatever satisfaction Paul might give to Philemon respecting
   the wound inflicted upon his character and honour, as the head of a
   family, it would not supersede the necessity of pardon being sought by
   the offender, and freely bestowed by the offended.

   "The reason of this difference is easily perceived. Debts are
   transferable, but crimes are not. A third person may cancel the one,
   but he can only obliterate the effects of the other; the desert of the
   criminal remains. The debtor is accountable to his creditor as a
   private individual, who has power to accept of a surety, or, if he
   please, to remit the whole without any satisfaction. In the one case he
   would be just, in the other merciful; but no place is afforded by
   either of them for the combination of justice and mercy in the same
   proceeding. The criminal, on the other hand, is amenable to the
   magistrate, or to the head of a family, as a public person; and who,
   especially if the offence be capital, cannot remit the punishment
   without invading law and justice; nor in the ordinary discharge of his
   office, admit of a third person to stand in his place. In extraordinary
   cases, however, extraordinary expedients are resorted to. A
   satisfaction may be made to law and justice, as to the spirit of them,
   while the letter is dispensed with. The well-known story of Zaleuchus,
   the Grecian lawgiver, who consented to lose one of his own eyes, to
   save one of his son's eyes--who, by transgressing the law, had
   subjected himself to the loss of both--is an example. Here, as far as
   it went, justice and mercy were combined in the same act; and had the
   satisfaction been much fuller than it was--so full that the authority
   of the law, instead of being weakened, should have been abundantly
   magnified and honoured, still it had been perfectly consistent with
   free forgiveness. Finally, in the case of the debtor, satisfaction
   being once accepted, justice requires his complete discharge; but m
   that of the criminal, where satisfaction is made to the wounded honour
   of the law and the authority of the lawgiver, justice, though it admits
   of his discharge, yet no otherwise requires it, than as it may have
   been matter of promise to the substitute.'"--Payne on Sovereignty, pp.
   142-5.

   This concluding observation, quoted by Dr. Payne from Andrew Fuller,
   unhappily clouds and obscures the whole of the valuable remarks which
   we have quoted in illustration of the point we have throughout been
   considering. It seems to indicate that the pardon of the sinner may, in
   one sense, be regarded as founded on a claim of justice, on the ground
   of a promise to the, substitute. What is the promise, on the ground of
   which pardon is here supposed to be, in any sense, a matter of justice?
   and where is it to be found? Can any man point to a single promise made
   to our glorious substitute, wherein God binds himself to pardon any
   sinner as a matter of right? Where or when did the Father stipulate
   with the Son to dispense forgiveness to the believer on the
   presentation of a claim of justice? This is what the theory we are now
   considering, and the mistake against which Fuller was writing, most
   erroneously assumes. It assumes that the death of Jesus was of the
   nature of a pecuniary transaction--a pounds-shillings-and-pence
   satisfaction--on the ground of which, God could not fail to pardon all
   for whom it was offered, without being unjust. If this be a. true
   representation of the death of the Son of God, the promise to dispense
   pardon, on the ground of it, could not be anything more or less than a
   promise to dispense a pardon which it would be unjust to withhold. But
   the extract just quoted points out the radical error which leads to
   such a view of the atonement; and our previous observations point out
   the fact, that the theory of election, which is based upon it, involves
   the subversion of free and sovereign grace. Now every blessing included
   in the promises of God to believers, God has pledged himself to
   communicate, not as an act of justice, but an act of grace. If then the
   promise itself involve a pledge to communicate blessings to the
   believing sinner, under the distinct provision that they might, every
   one of them, be righteously and justly withheld, it seems strange that
   any man should dream of founding upon such a promise a claim of justice
   and of right. We humbly submit, in opposition to the exceptionable
   statement on which we now remark, that even in the view of the promise,
   justice cannot require the release of the sinner who believeth in
   Jesus. This fact is certified by the very nature of the promise itself.
   It is the promise of pardon from a God, who, while he promises to
   pardon, promises also to retain and assert his right to condemn. It is
   a promise to dispense grace-free grace; and should any sinner lay hold
   of the promise, and seek to convert it into a claim of right, he
   thereby forfeits and rejects the very blessing which the Faithful and
   True Witness has pledged himself graciously to communicate. In the view
   of the promises, the sinner may, indeed, plead the FAITHFULNESS of a
   promise-loving and a promise-keeping God; but woe be to the man who
   perverts the grace of God, and the gracious promises of God, so as to
   imagine that, in any case, strict JUSTICE demands his release.

   It is worthy of passing observation, that the doctrine we are engaged
   in examining is, in its bearing upon the grace of God, the twin sister
   of Socinianism. The Socinian denies altogether the necessity of a
   satisfaction for sin in order to warrant God to show mercy and extend
   his grace to the sinner. He leaves no room for the exercise of grace,
   because he points the sinner to no atonement for the satisfaction of
   the justice and the vindication of the righteousness of Jehovah. He
   thereby renders the exercise of grace an utter impossibility. But
   extremes meet. And so the system of Calvin and Candlish, by pursuing a
   different route around the circle of error, lands men in the self-same
   unscriptural and false conclusion. The latter system destroys grace by
   ascribing to justice the justification of the sinner; while the former
   system destroys grace by leaving no room for its consistent
   development. The Calvinist exclaims, that God would act unjustly if he
   did not justify. The Socinian rejoins, that no satisfaction has ever
   been made at all to divine justice. The one sets aside grace by
   ascribing the result to justice; the other sets aside grace, by leaving
   the sword of justice still unsheathed, so as still to guard and barup
   the way against the possibility of a free--a gracious salvation. Both
   systems agree in denying the free grace of God, and, therefore, both
   are proved to be utterly at variance with the Scriptures of truth.

   Here, again, therefore, you perceive the application of the great
   principle exhibited at the outset of this discourse. And remembering
   the important distinction between what is above reason, and what is
   contrary to reason, you will be able, each one of you, freely to
   investigate, and candidly to decide. You will see that it is not with
   something plainly and distinctly revealed, but which is mysterious and
   concealed in its nature and bearings, that you have here to do. It is
   not with something above and beyond the reach of human reason to
   comprehend. We have here to do with a doctrine which is evidently
   absurd and false, because it is at once self-contradictory, and opposed
   to, and condemned by, the plainest doctrines of God's Word. It is
   utterly impossible for any man to believe two opposing statements at
   one and the same instant of time. He must cease to exercise his reason,
   and his common sense, if he can possibly be prevailed upon so to do. He
   must become a Papist, and hand over his conscience and his right of
   private judgment to the infallible Church, before he can possibly
   receive two contradictory statements as truth. The question, therefore,
   is level to the meanest capacity, and it is right that I should press
   it: Are you, my brethren, prepared to deny, and to cast aside, and to
   trample under foot, the free grace of God, and to perpetuate, as far as
   in you lies, the reign of error in our land, rather than cast away the
   doctrine which we have proved to be totally subversive of free grace?
   This is the simple question which we leave you to answer, every one of
   you, according to your responsibility to God, and not to man.

   But ere I close my present address, suffer me, beloved friends, to
   approach a little more closely to the personal experience of each
   individual sinner in this assembly. May I not speak to each man amongst
   you, even as one friend addresses another, in sweet and familiar
   intercourse, and inquire of each of you, personally and
   individually--Hast thou tasted that the Lord is gracious? Canst thou
   not, my brother, honestly trust the heart of thy God? Wouldst thou bind
   HIM down with covenants and bonds, so that thou canst not feel thyself
   safe in his hands, unless thou canst defy him to hurt a hair of thine
   head by a desperate appeal to iron-handed justice? Wilt thou not trust
   his grace? Is it not enough, that the justice of God is fully and for
   ever satisfied for all thy sins, so that justice no longer bars the
   door against thy speedy, instant return to thy forsaken home of
   everlasting safety, and thy Father's bosom of infinite compassion? Wilt
   thou not think thyself safe enough in His presence, unless thou art
   assured that his hand is bound down by justice, so that he dare not
   smite thee for thy sins? Whence arises all this doubt? Whence all this
   fearful suspicion and trembling dread? Whence the anxious surmise that
   thy guilty soul is Lost for ever, unless the God against whom thou hast
   rebelled, be bound in justice and in equity to save thee? Ah, my
   brother, seest thou not that all this is the work of the slanderer of
   thy God? "He loves thee not. He is a stern, relentless, heartless
   spirit. And withal he is omnipotent, and it is not safe for thee to
   trust him, unless thou seest him bound and shackled so that he cannot,
   dare not strike thee down." These are the suggestions of Satan,
   wherewith he would fill thy soul, O sinner, with unbelieving doubts and
   dark suspicions. "Behold the Lamb of God." Why did God give up his Son
   to die for all the world, and for thee? It was because he "so loved the
   world." His love, then, was not won or purchased by the wondrous
   sacrifice. His love to thy soul procured the sacrifice, and did not
   grudge the mighty cost whereby the flaming sword of angry justice might
   be averted from the gate which leads back to life and happiness for
   ever. Canst thou not, then, in the view of all this, trust the
   grace--the heart of thy God? Canst thou not trust that heart which
   loved thee so as to spare not his own Son? Canst thou not trust that
   heart which was pierced for thy sins upon the cross? Thy sins are all
   atoned for now. They form no reason why thou shouldst perish for ever.
   Thy Saviour's blood has washed them all away. But if in the face of all
   this, thou wilt still nourish thy damning unbelief, and hug to thy
   bosom a dark suspicion of thy God,--if thou wilt not cast aside thy
   doubts and fears until thou canst prevail upon thy trembling soul to
   think that thy God is bound, by an invincible necessity of justice and
   rectitude, to save thee,--if thou wilt not enter into heaven itself
   until thou canst read thy warrant, inscribed by the hand of justice
   over its shining portals--never--never--never canst thou enter in.


     "Man, on the dubious waves of error toss'd,

     His ship half-founder'd and his compass lost,

     Sees, far as human optics may command,

     A sleeping fog, and fancies it dry land;

     Spreads all his canvas, every sinew plies;

     Pants for't, aims at it, enters it, and dies!

     Then farewell all self-satisfying schemes,

     His well-built systems, philosophic dreams;

     Deceitful views of future bliss, farewell!--

     He reads his sentence at the flames of hell.

     Hard lot of man-to toil for the reward

     Of virtue, and yet lose it! Wherefore hard?

     He that would win the race must guide his horse

     Obedient to the customs of the course;

     Else, though unequall'd to the goal he flies,

     A meaner than himself shall gain the prize.

LECTURE THIRD.

   CALVINISM AN INSIDIOUS SYSTEM--INCONSISTENT WITH THE FOREKNOWLEDGE,
   OPPOSED TO THE WISDOM, AND SUBVERSIVE OF THE HOLINESS OF
   JEHOVAH--DESTRUCTIVE OF HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY.

   ISAIAH xlii. 9.--"Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new
   things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them."

   ISAIAH vi. 3.--"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts."

   JAMES i. 13.--"Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.

   THE system which we are engaged now in examining, like every other
   system of error, is, in many respects, very like the truth. But for
   this circumstance, it is impossible to conceive how it could meet with
   any countenance at all from Christian men. It is not, however, without
   very high-sounding professions of consistency with, and attachment to,
   the Word of God; and it adapts itself so cunningly and artfully to the
   language of Scripture, that it seems at first sight, and without a very
   careful and sifting examination, to be in no respect whatever
   inconsistent with the revealed mind of God. You will accordingly
   observe that the leading abettors of this system begin to wax very
   furious and indignant whenever we venture to intimate the slightest
   suspicion of the soundness of their creed. It is thus, however, with
   every counterfeit. The base coin would not pass current at all unless
   it bore a very striking resemblance to the genuine gold. The forgery
   would never answer its end unless it was very like the real signature.
   And were it not for the single fact, that the system of theology which
   we oppose does retain in plentiful abundance, and exhibit in bold
   relief, much of THE PHRASEOLOGY of Scripture, its real character would
   be instantly detected, and it would stand out exposed before the eyes
   of men. It is in the shape of an angel of light that the destroyer of
   the souls of men for the most part appears. And it is under the
   character and pretensions of a system of Bible truth that Calvinism
   makes its advances among the children of men. There is, accordingly, a
   wonderful TALKING about free grace and gospel tidings and divine
   sovereignty and human depravity, and such like important doctrines,
   among the abettors of this system. So manifest is this fact, that the
   simple and guileless multitude of men and women who are imposed upon by
   mere appearances, are very naturally shocked and disgusted whenever
   they hear it faithfully announced, that the system whereby they are
   verily deceived and imposed upon is really and truly a subverter of
   those precious truths which it professes to respect. The name of truth
   is, indeed, retained, but the thing signified by the name, even Truth
   herself, has been banished from the system. And were it not that the
   lovers of truth delight in listening to the very mention of her name,
   and never dream of suspecting, or so much as examining minutely into
   the real character of the Confession of Faith, and do find in THE BIBLE
   what they would never discover in THE CREED, it would not be possible
   to find one solitary Christian man prepared to stake his Christian
   reputation, side by side, with the system of which we speak. It is a
   relief to the mind which contemplates this horrid system of delusion to
   reflect, even for an instant, upon the circumstance to which we now
   advert. Many of the abettors of Calvinism are really ignorant of the
   system which they unhappily patronize: "they know not what they do;"
   "they themselves are saved, so as by fire." But while such persons are
   really angry with us when they listen for the first time to the grave
   and heavy charges which we advance against their system, "they do not
   well to be angry." And we should do no better if we were deterred,
   either by the disapprobation of good men, who are imposed upon by the
   mere pretensions of a theology which they have never examined, or by
   the impotent rage and calumnious aspersions of bad men, who know full
   well that the system cannot stand examination, and spend their strength
   in deceitful attempts to patch and paint the idol whereby precious
   souls are ruined: if either by the frown of the one or the fury of the
   other, we were deterred from faithfully and affectionately warning you
   and your children of your danger, we should be verily guilty of our
   brother's blood. We do not calumniate the system we oppose; we
   ourselves were many a long year deceived by it, and at the expense of
   the disruption of many a tie dear to flesh and blood, we have come out
   from its fatal and contaminating influence. We call upon you, our
   brethren, to "come out and be separate, and touch not the unclean
   thing." He is the calumniator who lifts his voice and wields his
   influence against a truth which he has never examined or brought to the
   test of the Word of God, but which he ignorantly stigmatizes by the
   name of heresy. We ask no more from any man among you than an
   examination of what is said to be true. If it be truth, it cannot
   suffer from the most searching scrutiny. And whoever he be who would
   dissuade or deter you, or himself shrink back from openly and honestly
   bringing his system of theology to the test of the Word of God, thereby
   betrays an innate consciousness of its weakness. While it is,
   therefore, a relief to the mind to believe that many of the adherents
   of this system are the children of God, it is unspeakably painful to
   think that any of the children of God should continue to countenance
   the system. They are betrayed, as we have said, by ignorance of the
   true character of what they sinfully uphold. They are seduced by mere
   pretensions. They are charmed away by a pleasing sound. No phrase is
   more frequently exhibited by this theology than FREE GRACE; but we have
   seen in our former Lecture that while the name is not taken away, the
   system we oppose destroys the thing itself, and really subverts the
   grace of God in the justification of the sinner who believes.

   We are about to call your attention this evening to another example of
   the perfidiousness and treachery of Calvinism. This system professes to
   be very zealous for the character of God, and more particularly does it
   profess to vindicate and uphold the great Bible doctrine respecting the
   FOREKNOWLEDGE, the WISDOM, and the HOLINESS of Jehovah. If it failed to
   exhibit this profession, the eyes of good men would at once be open to
   its true character, and it would instantly lose the influence which it
   exerts by virtue of its Christian name and its high religious
   pretensions. But we hope this evening to convince you, that the
   doctrine of Calvin and the Confession is really subversive of the
   divine foreknowledge as well as inconsistent with the wisdom and
   holiness of the Godhead.

   IV. THE FOURTH OBJECTION WHICH WE NOW ADDUCE AGAINST THE THEORY UNDER
   CONSIDERATION, ARISES FROM ITS INCONSISTENCY WITH THE DIVINE
   FOREKNOWLEDGE.

   When we speak of foreknowledge, we use a word which is familiar to you
   all. It may not be unnecessary, however, to anticipate and guard
   against prevalent misconceptions, by calling your attention, in this
   place, to one or two simple explanations. It will be observed,
   therefore, (1,) that foreknowledge implies, in every instance, the
   FUTURE and CERTAIN existence of the object known or apprehended by the
   mind. It is not FORE or before-hand knowledge if the object known or
   apprehended have a present or a past existence; and it is not KNOWLEDGE
   at all if there be any doubt or uncertainty in reference to the
   existence of the object apprehended, whether we conceive that object to
   be past or present or future in relation to the intelligence which
   apprehends it. There may be conjecture or guesswork where there is
   something less than positive certainty, but without certainty there can
   be no knowledge. You will notice, farther, in this connexion, (2,) that
   knowledge is something which is necessarily and invariably present in
   relation to the intelligence of whom such knowledge can be truthfully
   and invariably predicated. If it can be truly and invariably said of
   any being that "HE KNOWS," it is evident that the knowledge is
   invariably present whether the object of knowledge or the thing known
   be removed from him by space or by time--whether it be distant or
   future or past. The knowledge or act of the mind in knowing is always a
   present act, wherever the knowledge exists and by whomsoever it is
   possessed. My friend may be far distant from me, but the knowledge
   which I possess of his excellences is present; distance of time or
   place does not and cannot affect the knowledge itself, which can
   neither be past nor future nor distant, but, wherever it exists at all,
   exists necessarily as a PRESENT KNOWLEDGE. You will notice, (3,) that
   it is not the knowledge which originates the certainty, but the
   reverse. An event is not certain because it is known; it comes within
   the sphere of knowledge because it is certain. The knowledge of any
   event, whether past, present, or future, does not affect its certainty:
   it is known because it is certain. The cause of its existence must be
   sought elsewhere than in the knowledge whether fore or after.
   Foreknowledge does not, any more than after knowledge, define or
   certify anything as to THE CAUSE OR ORIGIN OF THE OBJECT apprehended by
   the mind.

   You will observe the importance of such explanations, the oversight of
   which lies at the foundation of much error and misconception on the
   subject now under consideration. Of this you may be convinced by a mere
   passing reference to a very popular and threadbare story, which is, no
   doubt, regarded as a conclusive demonstration by modern Calvinistic
   divines. It is related in the form of a conversation which is said to
   have taken place between a certain Independent minister and a
   fellow-traveller who strongly objected to the Calvinistic decrees.

   "I would ask," said the minister, "is the great God under any necessity
   of waiting till the last day in order to determine who are the
   righteous that are to be saved, and the wicked who are to perish?"

   "By no means," said the other, "for he certainly knows already."

   "When do you imagine," asked the minister, "that he first attained this
   knowledge?" Here the gentleman paused, and hesitated a little; but soon
   answered, "He must have known from all eternity."

   "Then," said the minister, "it must have been fixed from all eternity."

   "That by no means follows," replied the other.

   "Then it follows," added the minister, "that he did not know from all
   eternity, but only guessed, and happened to guess right; for how can
   Omniscience know what is yet uncertain?"

   Here the gentleman began to perceive his difficulty, and, after a short
   debate, confessed it should seem it must have been fixed from eternity.

   "Now," said the minister, "one question more will prove that you
   believe in predestination as well as I. You have acknowledged what can
   never be disproved, that God could not know from eternity who shall be
   saved unless it had been fixed from eternity. If then, it was fixed, be
   pleased, sir, to inform me who fixed it?"--Quoted in Bonar's "Truth and
   Error," pp. 61, 62.

   The gentleman is here said, as the story goes, to have acknowledged he
   had never taken this view of the subject before, and to have promised
   on the spot never more to speak against John Calvin or his decrees.

   You have here a specimen of a class of very ignorant or very crafty
   ministers on the one hand, and of very simple and very thoughtless
   gentlemen on the other. Both parties evidently overlooked the fact,
   that KNOWLEDGE defines nothing whatever respecting THE CAUSE of the
   event known. Knowledge, whether of a past or of a future event,
   apprehends the certain existence of whatever it apprehends at all, but
   it does not cause or originate the existence of anything whatever. But
   both the minister and the gentleman failed to observe this fact, and so
   they erroneously concluded that God's infallible knowledge of all
   events, involves, on his part,. the necessary causation of all events,
   as if nothing whatever could be certainly foreknown unless it were
   certainly and absolutely decreed, or "fixed," by God himself. The
   gentleman was, therefore, confused and mystified by the gratuitous and
   false assumption, that unless God had himself unconditionally or
   absolutely "fixed" or decreed whatsoever comes to pass, he could not
   foreknow the certain existence of anything future, but "ONLY GUESSED,
   and happened to guess right." But if this gentleman had only considered
   what he unfortunately overlooked and misapprehended, he would have seen
   at once that the knowledge of any object, past, present, or future,
   does not call that object into existence, or render its existence
   certain. He would have seen the very opposite to be true. Ho would have
   seen that the knowledge of anything future presupposes and apprehends
   its certain future existence, no less evidently than the knowledge of
   any present or past event presupposes and apprehends its present or
   past existence, altogether independently of, or (it may even be)
   altogether opposed to, the will of the being who knows it. When our
   Saviour was upon the earth, he compassionately sought to convince his
   crafty antagonists by wisely saying unto them, "I also will ask of you
   one question" (Mark xi. 29), instead of replying directly to their
   leading queries, which were purposely framed to entrap and to ensnare
   him. And if this Christian gentleman had followed the example of his
   master, he would have replied to the very first question of the
   minister who led him into the snare, by proposing a question which
   would have "fixed" his reverend adversary. When the minister asked him,
   "Is the great God under any necessity of waiting till the last day IN
   ORDER TO KNOW who will be saved and who will be lost?" the gentleman
   would have done well to have said, "I also will ask of you one
   question--Is the great God under any necessity of himself causing and
   necessitating the, commission of sin, IN ORDER TO KNOW' the sinful
   actions which shall be committed by devils and by wicked men?" Had such
   a question been kindly and respectfully proposed, we should very
   probably have heard nothing at all from Calvinists of the threadbare
   narrative which it has become fashionable to retail. Such a question as
   this would certainly have brought the minister to a stand, even as our
   Saviour's question "fixed" the Pharisees when he asked them, "The
   baptism of John, was it from heaven or of men?" The minister would very
   probably have paused and argued thus within himself:--"If I shall say
   that God is the primary cause of sinful actions, I fear the people,
   because they believe that THE LORD OUR GOD IS HOLY;' and if I shall say
   that God can foreknow any thing which he has not himself determined to
   bring to pass, he will say, Why then do you believe John Calvin's
   unscriptural creed?'"--and so, in all likelihood, the debate would have
   terminated.

   But it is at this point that the inquiry ought to begin. The question
   is, whether it be not a blasphemy against God to maintain a creed which
   affirms plainly that, "for his own glory, God hath foreordained
   whatsoever comes to pass." Our opponents in this argument, have no
   right to hold that this question is to be decided simply on the faith
   of their false and blundering assertions. They have no right to assert
   and to take it for granted, without even an attempt at proof, that
   OMNISCIENCE is capable of doing no more than "GUESSING" after an event,
   unless OMNIPOTENCE be pledged to bring that event into being. We are
   entitled to demand the strongest PROOF in support of this important
   statement, and our friends who oppose us are not entitled to give us no
   more than bare ASSERTION in its support, as from the time of their
   sainted Augustine they have invariably done. We demand the evidence in
   support of the assertion on which Calvinism and Fatalism and Socialism
   are all of them based--the assertion that God himself is incapable of
   foreknowing things future, without previously resolving, by his
   Omnipotence, to bring them into existence.

   On this point we have been absolutely deluged with assertion, but we
   look in vain for one particle of proof. It has been assumed, as if it
   were even an axiom, that whatever is UNDECREED by God is for that
   simple reason a thing UNCERTAIN, and to be fathered upon a nonentity
   which men call "CHANCE." You will notice therefore the importance of
   the simple facts which have been. already submitted to your attention,
   and you will more particularly remember that the very idea of
   foreknowledge implies the idea of certainty, but the question remains
   still to be disposed of, whether it be true, as Calvinists assert, that
   God cannot foreknow future events, without first of all decreeing their
   certain existence, and then apprehending them through the medium of his
   own decree.

   That such is the position maintained by Calvinists, is, evident from
   all their writings, from some of which I select now one or two
   quotations.

   I call your attention, in the first place, to a single statement from
   their great master himself. John Calvin writes as follows, in the
   twenty-third chapter of the third book of his Institutes:--

   "Since he [God] DOTH NOT OTHERWISE FORESEE the things that shall come
   to pass, than because he hath decreed that they should so come to pass,
   it is vain to move a controversy about foreknowledge where it is
   certain that all things do happen rather by ordinance and commandment.
   . . . . No man shall be able to deny but that God foreknew what end man
   should have, ere he created him, and THEREFORE FOREKNEW IT BECAUSE he
   had so ordained by his decree."--Sec. 6, 7.

   Such are Calvin's own words, and you will notice that there are two
   separate and distinct statements contained therein, the first of which
   is admitted to be true, but the second of which is altogether false and
   unsupported in any place by the smallest shadow of evidence. The first
   statement asserts what no man denies--the foreknowledge of God. The
   second statement assumes what cannot be proved, and what no Calvinist,
   so far as we know, has ever attempted to establish by anything like
   proof, viz., that God does not foreknow anything he has not himself
   fixed by his own absolute and irreversible decree. But, unfortunately
   for Calvinism, it so happens that the very point which is universally
   taken for granted, is the precise point which needs to be unanswerably
   proved.

   Jerom Zanchius, another distinguished Calvinist; writes as
   follows:--"God's foreknowledge, taken abstractedly, is not the sole
   cause of beings and events; but his will and foreknowledge together.
   Hence we find, Acts ii. 23, that his determinate council and
   foreknowledge act in concert; THE LATTER RESULTING FROM, AND BEING
   FOUNDED ON, THE FORMER. . . . . Consequently it is his free pleasure to
   permit sin, since, without his permission, neither men nor devils can
   do anything. Now, to permit, is, at least, the same as not to hinder,
   though it be in our power to hinder if we please; and this permission
   or non-hindrance is certainly an act of the Divine will. Hence, Austin
   says, Those things which seemingly thwart the Divine will are
   nevertheless agreeable to it; for if God did not permit them, they
   could not be done; and whatever God permits he permits freely and
   willingly. He does nothing, neither suffers anything to be done against
   his own will.' And Luther observes that God permitted Adam to fall into
   sin, because he willed that he should so fall.'"--The Doctrine of
   Absolute Predestination, translated from the Latin of Zanchius, by
   Augustus Topladly, with Prefatory Essay by the late Dr. Pringle of the
   Secession Church, Perth, pp. 39, 40.

   This quotation proves not only that foreknowledge is held by the
   Calvinist to be founded on God's absolute decree, but it evinces still
   farther the important fact, that according to this theology the
   foreknowledge is really confounded with the decree altogether, inasmuch
   as it is in plain words spoken. of as in connexion with the the decree,
   "THE POSITIVE CAUSE of all beings and events."

   This wonderful mixture of truth and error is exhibited by Mr. Bonar of
   the Free Church, in his appropriately-named book. I quote the following
   extract from the fiftieth page of "TRUTH AND ERROR."

   "It is of some importance [says Mr. Bonar] that we should settle the
   nature of these two things, predestination and foreknowledge, and
   ascertain which of the two is first. The question, is Does God fix a
   thing simply because he foreknows it, or does he foreknow it because he
   has fixed it?' . . . . I answer unhesitatingly, That PREDESTINATION
   MUST BE THE FOUNDATION of foreknowledge. God foreknows EVERYTHING THAT
   TAKES PLACE BECAUSE HE HAS FIXED IT."

   We pause again to call your attention to the absurdity which Calvinists
   incessantly perpetrate by a sheer forgetfulness of the plain
   explanations to which we have formerly adverted. Mr. Bonar writes as if
   anything foreknown needed to be subsequently fixed by a decree of God,
   and he accordingly proposes the ridiculous question, "Does God fix a
   thing simply because he foreknows it?" He cannot conceive of anything
   as certain or foreseen as certain, unless it has been fixed unalterably
   by the almighty will of God! And so you will observe, that this writer
   gives us the benefit of his own simple assurance in common with that of
   his fellow Calvinists, that God first fixes and decrees to bring
   everything to pass; and then, and only then, is it possible for God to
   know beforehand anything that shall afterwards happen!

   The only other quotation which I shall now make, is from the Lectures
   on Theology, which were delivered to the students of the Secession
   Church (now United Presbyterian), by the late Dr. Dick of Glasgow.

   "No effect can be viewed as future [says this Professor], or, in human
   language, can be the object of certain expectation, but when considered
   in relation to its efficient cause; and the cause of all things which
   ever shall exist is the purpose of God, who worketh all things after
   the counsel of his own will.' As the knowledge of God does not depend
   upon the actual existence of objects--for this would limit it to the
   present and the past--so it does not depend upon any conditions
   attached to their existence. He does not know that such things shall
   happen, if such other things shall go before; but the whole series of
   events was planned by his infinite understanding, the ends as well as
   the means: and he foresees the ends, not through the medium of the
   means, but THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HIS OWN DECREE, in which they have a
   certain future existence. They will not take place without the means,
   but THE PROPER cause of them is not the means, but his almighty
   will."--Vol. i. p. 384, first edition.

   We add no more in this place in the shape of quotation, and we have
   detained you with such extracts, from ancient and modern authors,
   simply with the view of anticipating the charge of misrepresentation,
   which Calvinists are not slow to make whenever their dogmas happen to
   be subjected to a fair examination. It is better therefore to leave our
   friends to speak for themselves.

   What then do you think of their creed? What is its evident bearing upon
   the foreknowledge of the Deity? Does it not reduce the attribute of
   omniscience to a mere name, and resolve it into a thing which is
   dependent upon, and subordinate to, the omnipotence of the Godhead?
   Does it not strip God of his peculiarly glorious distinction, as an
   ALL-SEEING Jehovah? And while this theology does retain the name, does
   it not set aside the reality, and represent God himself as reduced to
   the necessity of learning or acquiring the knowledge of futurity,
   exclusively from his present existing determinations and his present
   existing power? And is not this, properly speaking, a knowledge of
   something PRESENT, as much as of any thing future? When we speak of
   knowledge as INTUITIVE, we surely mean to express something very
   different from knowledge ACQUIRED through any medium whatever. And when
   we ascribe omniscience to the Deity, we surely mean to intimate
   something more than the possession, on his part, of a mere perception
   of what is his present will at any future time to bring assuredly to
   pass. Such a knowledge as this is possessed by the meanest of created
   intelligences. The question, therefore, resolves itself simply into
   this--"Whether the knowledge of God be, or be not, distinguished from
   that even of the highest of his creatures, by virtue not only of its
   extent, but more especially of its independence--its absolute
   independence, even of his own decrees." We humbly submit that this
   question must be answered in the affirmative, from the three following
   considerations:--Consider (1) the innate and infinite perfection of the
   Divine intelligence, and say whether omniscience needs to derive its
   information through any conceivable medium. Consider (2) the infinite
   purity of the Divine nature, and say whether sin and every abominable
   thing which exists, could possibly find its origin and cause in the
   mind of a holy God--a supposition involved necessarily in the
   hypothesis, that God needed first to decree in order that he might be
   able to foreknow whatsoever comes to pass. Consider (3) the direct and
   explicit language of Scripture, wherein the decree of God is exhibited
   as consequent upon his foreknowledge, which is a plain contradiction of
   the theory that his foreknowledge is dependent upon his decree. It is
   written, for example, in Rom. viii. 29, "Whom he did FOREKNOW, he also
   did PREDESTINATE;" and in 1 Peter i. 2, "Elect ACCORDING TO the
   foreknowledge of God." In such like statements of the inspired record,
   the foreknowledge is in the order of nature prior to the decree.

   We say not only that Calvinism is UN-scriptural, based as it is upon a
   gratuitous assumption which derives no warrant from the Word of God;
   but we are entitled to denounce this figment of man's imagination as
   ANTI-scriptural, inasmuch as it is founded entirely upon the monstrous
   conception, that nothing whatever could possibly be certainly
   apprehended, even by the Divine mind, save through the medium of a
   horrible and demon-like decree. And more especially do we now call your
   attention to the fact, that the true and proper foreknowledge of the
   Deity (by which we mean his independent and intuitive apprehension of
   all things actual and all things possible--of all things future as well
   as of all that is past or present) is blasphemously denied by the
   theory now under consideration. This theory degrades the Godhead
   beneath the level of many of his creatures. Whatever any sinful
   creature possesses the power to do, and resolves to carry into
   execution, the creature must of necessity foreknow. Grant ye that he
   has the will to act, and that he possesses in addition to the will, the
   power to carry his purpose into execution, and the basest of the fallen
   intelligences must needs be able, with infallible certainty, to predict
   the result. But there is nothing peculiar--nothing wonderful in any
   sinful mortal claiming and possessing an attribute such as this. You
   may wonder at the man's power, or you may be astounded at the man's
   purpose to employ his power in any given direction, but you cannot
   wonder at the man's knowledge. He merely predicts or foretells what he
   has himself determined to carry into effect in the exercise, it may be,
   of his astonishing powers. Suppose that it is a deed of darkness which
   the man contemplates. He comes to you announcing, for example, that on
   some future day, and at a given hour, your friend will certainly die.
   You are astonished at the man's intelligence. You ask eagerly and
   anxiously how he happens to know the very day and hour when his
   fellow-mortal is to be ushered into eternity. But what if, at the hour
   and day appointed, you come. to learn that the pretended prophet did
   himself determine to murder your friend with his own hand, and did
   acquire his foreknowledge through the medium of his own decree? Would
   you, in such a case, laud your informant as a very wonderful prophet?
   Would you not rather proclaim him a murderer--a cool, deliberate
   murderer--whose dire prediction was founded solely on his dire decree?
   In such a case the murderer has no claim whatever to the character of
   the prophet. It is not his foreknowledge, but his villany, of which you
   would speak. And in such A case it might well be questioned, if it be
   not an abuse of language to ascribe to him the attribute of
   foreknowledge at all. The reason is, that in such a case what the man
   knew was, properly speaking, his own dark and villanous intention, and
   his own abused and perverted power. But these were PRESENT at the time
   when the prediction was first announced, and it was through the medium
   of these alone that the murderer pried into the future, and so,
   strictly speaking, it was not so much the knowledge of the future
   event, as the knowledge of a present determination or purpose, which
   was intimated to you in the form of a prophecy. This is a revelation of
   a purpose already formed, which depends for its fulfilment merely on
   the will and power of the executioner, and forms of itself no proper
   exhibition of foreknowledge on the part of the individual who utters
   it.

   Let this illustration be applied to the question now before us., It is
   said that the decree of God is the exclusive foundation of his
   foreknowledge. He is said to foreknow whatever shall come to pass,
   simply because he has himself resolved, by an act of his almighty will,
   to bring about whatsoever comes to pass. His knowledge, therefore, of
   the events of futurity is not anything more than a necessary existing
   consciousness of his present determination, coupled with a
   consciousness of his resistless power. It amounts to nothing more than
   a consciousness of what he himself has purposed, in the exercise of
   omnipotence, to bring about. And while it cannot be denied that all
   this may exalt the power of God, we hold it to be self-evident, that it
   strikes at the root of his omniscience, which involves, on his part,
   the independent or intuitive perception of all the thoughts and words
   and deeds of his free and intelligent and responsible creatures, and
   that too from the unbeginning ages of eternity.

   This is the peculiar glory of God as an omniscient being. His peculiar
   glory consists in his knowing infallibly from all eternity the free
   volitions and actions of free and responsible agents who exist in time.
   This is what is fitted to strike the human mind with wonder and
   adoration. That God should know, with infallible certainty, all the
   thoughts and intents--all the purposes and doings, of all the
   generations of men before men came into being! That is the wonder. And
   that forms the grand and striking peculiarity of the prophetic
   announcements contained in the blessed Bible, which being fulfilled to
   the very letter, in the history of the human race, have, in every age,
   manifested the book wherein they are contained, to be emphatically THE
   BOOK OF GOD.

   While, therefore, there exists not a creature, however ignorant or
   vile, who does not know, of necessity, beforehand, whatever he has the
   will and the power himself to execute, and who may not, in every such
   case, predict the result with infallible certainty,--while the most
   debased of created intelligences is possessed of foreknowledge such as
   this, where is the man or the angel, however exalted in intellect or
   knowledge, who can predict, with infallible certainty, what shall be
   the volitions and actions of moral and intelligent agents, upon whose
   minds no irresistible force is exercised, but WHO ARE FREE to think and
   act, to choose or to refuse, as each shall independently determine?
   This is something which the Bible assures us belongs only to God. This
   is an achievement so truly marvellous, and so far beyond the reach of
   men, that no man can tell how it comes to pass. Here is something ABOVE
   reason, and here we have an apt illustration and example of the
   principle adverted to at the outset of our last Sabbath evening
   lecture, in reference to what is above reason as distinguished from
   what is contrary to reason. There is nothing here to shock our reason.
   There are no such palpable contradictions as are to be found everywhere
   in Calvinism for men to gulp down--there is no contradiction at all in
   this glorious truth. And though it be far above the reach of the human
   mind to scrutinize the HOW and the WHEREFORE--though no man nor angel
   can say, how it is or wherefore it is--we have here something which
   exalts the Godhead in our conceptions, and which constrains us to
   wonder and to adore. "' Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst
   thou find out the Almighty un.to perfection? It is high as heaven, what
   canst thou do? deeper than hell, what canst thou know? The measure
   thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea." Job xi.
   7-9. The disciple of Calvin tells us that HE, forsooth! cannot
   understand how God can possibly foreknow whatsoever comes to pass,
   unless it be that God has fixed, by his decree, every abomination that
   takes place under the sun, and has determined himself to bring it
   about. And what does the self-blinded devotee presume to do? He
   presumes to measure the mind of God by his own puny intellect, and to
   affirm that God must have infallibly and unconditionally "foreordained
   whatsoever comes to pass." And why? Because short-sighted mortals
   cannot understand how God can foreknow anything as certain, or can do
   more than "GUESS" the existence of anything which God has not himself
   determined to bring into being! This is not only most unfair and
   inconclusive reasoning, if reasoning indeed it can be called, it is the
   framing of a man-made, arbitrary theory; it is pure speculation, and
   that, too, in direct opposition to the Word of God. What said the sweet
   singer of Israel? Did he deny such knowledge as this, because it was
   peculiar to God, and far too wonderful for his finite comprehension?
   Did he attempt to bring the subject of the Divine foreknowledge down to
   the level of his capacity by approaching the blundering, blasphemous
   conclusion, that GOD MUST have first resolved to exert his power in
   determining his downsitting and his uprising, and giving birth to his
   every wicked thought, and chalking out his every devious course--and
   then, and thus only, was enabled to know all that concerned him long
   before his thoughts came into existence? Such was not the mind of the
   inspired psalmist. "O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou
   knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; thou understandest my thought
   afar off. Thou compassest my path, and my lying down, and art
   acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but,
   lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind and
   before, and laid thine hand upon me." Psalm cxxxix. 1-5.

   What, then, was the conclusion at which the psalmist arrived? Did he
   account for the circumstance, that God knew his thought afar off, on
   the Socialist principle, that God had decreed the existence of his
   every thought? Did he console himself under his iniquity by falling
   back upon the decree of God as the ultimate cause of it? Did he say
   that he could easily account for the foreknowledge of God by tracing
   that knowledge to a previous decree? No such thing. He immediately adds
   (verse 6), "SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS TOO WONDERFUL FOR ME; IT IS HIGH, I
   CANNOT ATTAIN UNTO IT." But such knowledge is not too high for the
   follower of Calvin! He can explain it all! He has a ready-made theory,
   whereby he can easily account for knowledge such as this! It is such
   knowledge as any creature can attain unto, even as every creature must
   necessarily foreknow the existence of what he has himself decreed! The
   Calvinist will not condescend to stoop down to the position occupied by
   the psalmist, but he at once rushes onward, in the pride of his system
   of theology, to the impious DENIAL of the Divine foreknowledge of every
   thought, word, and deed of men and devils, which God has not originated
   and foreordained! Horrible conclusion! Away with the theology which
   inculcates it! Such a theology is a wild dream of pagan philosophy, a
   delusion, and a falsehood from the father of lies, wherewith he
   practises a foul deception upon the souls of men!

   We have already quoted an extract from Jerom Zanchius, translated by
   Toplady, and recommended by Dr. Pringle of the Secession, to the
   Scottish public. And as we have distinctly asserted that the doctrine
   of Calvin and the Confession of Faith is part and parcel of pagan
   philosophy, we here read to you the reply which Toplady gives to this
   very grave accusation, which has been long ago advanced against the
   theory now under review. In the fifteenth page of his preface, this
   writer meets the charge by indirectly admitting it:--

   "But does not this doctrine tend [says he] to the establishment of
   FATALITY? Supposing it even did, were it not better to be a CHRISTIAN
   FATALIST than to avow a set of loose Arminian principles, which, if
   pushed to their natural extent, inevitably terminate in the rankest
   Atheism? For, without predestination there can be no Providence, and,
   without Providence, no God.

   "After all, what do you mean by FATE? If you mean a regular succession
   of determined events, from the beginning to the end of time; an
   uninterrupted chain, without a single chasm; all depending on the
   eternal will and continued influence of the GREAT FIRST CAUSE; if this
   is Fate, it must be owned. . . .

   "It having been not unusual, with the Arminian writers, to tax us with
   adopting THE FATE OF THE ANCIENT STOICS, 1 thought it might not be
   unacceptable to the English reader to subjoin a brief view of what
   those philosophers generally held (for they were not all exactly of a
   mind) as to this particular. It will appear to every competent reader,
   from what is there given, how far the doctrine of FATE, as believed and
   taught by the STOICS, may be admitted upon CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES. [3] .
   . .

   "For my own particular part [adds Toplady] I frankly confess that, as
   far as the coincidence of the STOICAL FATE with the Bible
   predestination holds good, I see no reason why we should be ashamed to
   acknowledge it. St. Austin, and many other great and excellent men,
   have not scrupled to admit both the word (viz., the word FATE) and THE
   THING, properly understood. I am quite of LIPSIUS'S mind, Et vero non
   aversabor STOICI nomen; sed STOICI CHRISTIANI,' i. e., I have no
   objection to be called a STOIC, so you but prefix the word CHRISTIAN to
   it."--Preface to Zanchius on Predestination, by Toplady, pp. 15-17.

   Such, then, is an honest confession of a disciple of Calvin of no mean
   name. The system speaks for itself, and no man who looks it in the face
   but must see more of the pagan than of the Christian pervading its
   every feature. But as we live now in an age and country where many
   Calvinistic divines labour not to defend, but to conceal and hide, the
   abominable system from the eyes of the multitude, who still, in tears,
   follow it onward to the scaffold, it is necessary to hold it up before
   you as it has been stated and defended by a generation of less
   temporizing and more honest men. There is no need for weeping and
   bewailing the approaching destruction of this monstrous system. Let
   every Christian man and woman in this audience rejoice and give thanks
   to God, that the time has arrived when the great majority of professed
   Calvinists are ashamed of their idol, and are tacitly, at least, even
   now, consenting to its too tardy execution.

   V. WE OBJECT TO THIS THEORY OF ELECTION, BECAUSE IT SUBVERTS THE WISDOM
   OF GOD IN HIS DECREES.

   We take Dr. Dick's own definition of wisdom, as found in the
   Twenty-Second Lecture of his course. This author very truly says,
   "Wisdom cannot exist without knowledge, but knowledge may exist without
   wisdom; and accordingly there are men possessing very extensive
   information who, in their conduct, give many proofs of thoughtlessness
   and folly. In an all-perfect being, they are necessarily conjoined,
   omniscience supplies the materials of infinite wisdom. As God knows all
   his creatures, all their powers and qualities, all the purposes to
   which they may be rendered subservient, all the relations in which they
   may be placed, and all the possible consequences of all possible
   events, he is able infallibly to determine what are the most proper
   ends to be pursued, and what are the fittest means of effecting them."

   With these sentiments every one must agree. But you will observe their
   bearing upon the system now tinder review.

   There can be no wisdom without knowledge going before it. And thus it
   is that WE argue out the wisdom of all God's purposes and decrees. They
   are most wise, because they are founded upon the foreknowledge of all
   the future volitions and actions of free agents who shall exist in
   time.

   But Calvinism says that the foreknowledge of God is founded on his
   decrees. God knows whatever shall come to pass, in consequence of
   having already decreed whatever shall come to pass.

   The decree of God is accordingly represented as independent of, and in
   the order of nature before, his knowledge.

   Seeing, therefore, that there can be no wisdom without knowledge, the
   decrees of God cannot possibly be wise! Themselves the foundation of
   all knowledge in the mind of the Deity, they preceded all knowledge,
   and were formed ignorantly and blindly! Such is the predestination of
   Calvin. It is nothing more nor less than blind necessity--unadulterated
   fatalism. We proceed to notice,

   VI. THAT THIS THEORY OF ELECTION DESTROYS ALL MORAL DISTINCTIONS
   BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG, GOOD AND EVIL; AND THEREBY STANDS OPPOSED TO
   THE HOLINESS OF GOD.

   We have already seen that it traces every thing which takes place in
   the universe to the almighty will of God, as the efficient and primary
   cause of all. It is very often said, in so many words, by the
   supporters of Calvin, that God is not the cause of sin; but such a true
   saying, proceeding from Calvinists, is nothing more nor less than an
   idle and unmeaning and heartless compliment. Such a truthful
   announcement is contradicted by the system, and is a mere word of
   course. It reminds one of the traitor Judas, when he went up to Jesus
   and said, "Hail, Master, and kissed him." It is verily true that God is
   not the author of sin, but why should men cleave to a system of
   theology which represents God as the only originator and cause of all
   iniquity--a system which forces men to the conclusion that, in
   asserting the holiness of God, the Holy Spirit is studiously hiding and
   concealing the truth--a system which makes God the author of every
   abomination that ever was perpetrated among men? Does the Shorter
   Catechism make any exception when it says, that "God has foreordained
   WHATSOEVER comes to pass"? Does it not here trace everything, without
   exception, to the decree of God? Does it not teach babes and sucklings
   to say, that God has decreed every sinful action; and, in connexion
   with this, that "God executeth his decrees in the works of creation and
   providence"? Here is, first of all, every abomination fathered upon the
   decree of God and here is, in the second place, God pointed out as the
   active executioner of the whole array of wickedness that comes to pass
   in the history of devils and of men Here is, surely, "THE MYSTERY OF
   INIQUITY," which, even in apostolic times, had already begun to do its
   deadly work, and to emit its horrid blasphemies. Listen to another
   statement from Zanchius, from whom I have already quoted: "I would
   infer [says this writer, p. 63] that if we would maintain the doctrine
   of God's OMNIPOTENCE, we must insist upon that of his UNIVERSAL AGENCY;
   the latter cannot be denied without giving up the former. Disprove that
   he is almighty, and then we will grant that his influence and
   operations are limited and circumscribed. Luther says that God would
   not be a RESPECTABLE BEING, if he were not almighty, and THE DOER OF
   ALL THINGS THAT ARE DONE; or if anything could come to pass in which he
   had no hand."

   In accordance with this doctrine, Mr. Bonar of the Free Church says, in
   "Truth and Error,"--"Nothing in the universe takes place without the
   will of God. This is admitted. But it is asked, Is this will first in
   everything? I answer, Yes. The will of God goes before all other wills.
   It does not depend on them, but they depend on it. ITS MOVEMENTS
   REGULATE THEM. The I will' of Jehovah is that which sets in motion
   everything in heaven and in earth. The I will' of Jehovah is the spring
   and origin of all that is done throughout the universe, great or small,
   among things animate or inanimate." P. 24.

   It follows, naturally and necessarily, from this doctrine, that there
   is no distinction between good and evil, right and wrong, truth and
   error, sin and holiness! Everything is in accordance with the "I will"
   of Jehovah! His will must be right; and whatever is, is accordingly
   RIGHT--seeing that everything is in accordance with the will of God,
   who "would not be a respectable being," if he were not himself "the
   doer of all things that are done,"--devils and wicked men being only
   the passive tools in his almighty hand!!!

   Said we not truly that we have here the full development of "the
   mystery of iniquity," bellowing forth her horrid blasphemies against
   God; and by her loud and specious pretensions of attachment to the Word
   of God, deceiving, "if it were possible, the very elect"? The upholders
   of this system make an attempt to wrench from the hand of the Spirit
   his own "sword," by the perversion or abuse of which they all the more
   effectually slay the souls of men. It is not for us to say one word
   about their motives. For these they are responsible to God, and God
   alone can see their hearts. Let God be the judge of their motives. We
   say not that the men MEAN to destroy souls by perverting the Word of
   God, and wresting Scripture itself in support of their blasphemy. We
   speak not of what they intend to do, but of what they persist in doing.
   And we affirm, that they not only charge home upon a holy God all the
   iniquity which takes place among devils and men, but they wrest the
   very Scripture, and pervert its blessed truths in order to gain
   currency for their false philosophy, whereby God is dishonoured, and
   merchandise is made of the souls of men. In order to prove that God has
   foreordained all iniquity, the author of "Truth and Error" singles out
   the most awful crime upon record, and fathers it directly upon God's
   decree, and refers to the Bible itself in support of his theory.
   "Everything in this world [says Mr. Bonar] happens according to God's
   eternal arrangements. Nothing takes place except what God causes to be,
   or permits to be; and whatever happens in time, is decreed from
   eternity. EVEN THE WICKED DEED of those who crucified the Lord of Glory
   is said, by the apostle, to be determined before by the hand and
   counsel of God. Acts iv. 27, 28; also ii. 23."--Truth and Error, p. 37.

   Here, then, is a very plain and distinct statement, on the part of our
   Free Church writer, and if this statement be true, we must admit that
   God is the author of all iniquity. But we are prepared most
   emphatically to deny the statement which this writer has made. The
   passages of Scripture referred to DO NOT ascribe to God "THE WICKED
   DEED" of those who crucified the Lord of Glory. God determined
   beforehand to do whatever HE HIMSELF DID in the transactions of
   Calvary, but he never decreed any part of the wickedness which was
   perpetrated there, or which has been perpetrated elsewhere by devils or
   by wicked men. But as this assertion commits us to a full examination
   of the two Scripture passages which have been perverted in the
   quotations we have just read, we reserve such examination as the
   subject of our next discourse.

   morsel of heathenism, from which the reader will see whence Calvinism
   has sprung--not from the Bible, but from the schools of pagan

LECTURE FOURTH.

   PRECEDENCY OF GOD'S WILL TO MAN'S WILL--"WHATSOEVER COMES TO PASS" NOT
   FOREORDAINED--GOD HAS NOT DECREED WICKEDNESS--MAN ALONE RESPONSIBLE FOR
   HIS SOUL'S SALVATION.

   JAMES i. 13.--"Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of
   God:: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any
   man."

   ACTS ii. 23.--"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
   foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified
   and slain."

   ACTS iv. 27.--"'Of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
   anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the
   people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand
   and thy counsel determined before to be done."

   JOHN x. 18.--"No man taketh it [my life] from me, but I lay it down of
   myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
   again."

   "NOTHING in the universe [says Mr. Bonar, in the extracts quoted in our
   last Lecture] takes place without the will of God. This is admitted.
   But it is asked, Is this will FIRST IN EVERYTHING? I answer, Yes. The
   will of God goes before all other wills. It does not depend on them,
   but they depend on it. Its movements regulate them. The I will' of
   Jehovah is that which sets in motion EVERYTHING in heaven and in earth.
   The I will' of Jehovah is the SPRING AND ORIGIN OF ALL THAT IS DONE
   throughout the universe, great or small, among things animate and
   inanimate. EVERYTHING in this world happens according to God's eternal
   arrangements. Nothing takes place except what God causes to be or
   permits to be; and whatever happens in time is decreed from eternity.
   EVEN THE WICKED DEED of those who crucified the Lord of Glory is said,
   by the apostle, to, be determined before by the hand and counsel of
   God."

   It will be observed, therefore, what the great question before us
   really is:--"Is the will of God FIRST IN EVERYTHING." That is the real
   question, we might almost say the ONLY question, to be disposed of. It
   is necessary that this point should be well understood and steadily
   kept in view. This is necessary, because the writer from whom we have
   now again quoted, in common with all his brethren, is constantly
   forgetting the question under discussion, and very generally writes and
   speaks and acts as if the real question were--"Is the will of God first
   in ANYTHING." These divines are ever and anon engaged in directing
   their anathemas against us, as if we denied the precedency of the
   Divine will in the conversion and ultimate salvation of the sinner. It
   is, therefore, necessary for you to understand distinctly that there is
   no question upon this point between us and the brethren whose doctrine
   we oppose. That the will of God is first in the salvation of every
   sinner who is saved--that this will goes before every other will, and
   is the spring or origin of all that is holy or excellent or fair or
   good in the wide universe--that whatever is good or happy in creation
   or providence is to be traced to the will of God as its ultimate origin
   or source--all this we rejoice to admit, and do constantly affirm, and
   stand prepared, from reason and from Scripture, unanswerably to
   demonstrate. It will be observed, therefore, that our opponents in
   argument only manifest the weakness of their cause, and the miserable
   position of their system of theology, when they indulge in slanderous
   and false assertions against the truth which they oppose and revile as
   heresy. It is vain for them to misrepresent and slander the sentiments
   of their opponents, by asserting, as they do, that our system makes the
   will of man to be supreme, and undeifies the Deity--that we make the
   sinner his own Saviour--that we deny the sovereignty and grace of God,
   and reduce all things to mere chance work. Such assertions as these may
   indeed deceive the ignorant, and impose upon indolent or prejudiced
   minds, who will not take the trouble to inquire for themselves; but as
   the progress of inquiry goes forward, and men begin to THINK and to
   investigate, such assertions as these will be detected in their true
   character, and will only expose the falsehood and the delusiveness of
   that system of theology which NEEDS such crutches in order to prevent
   its instant prostration. We have once more given prominence to the
   statements of a Free Church minister, in order to set the question in
   its true and proper position. We take it as Mr. Bonar has correctly
   enough stated it. It is not whether the will of God be first in
   ANYTHING, but, "Is this will first in EVERYTHING?" To this question the
   theology we oppose answers, "Yes;" while we affirm that the Word of
   God, and common sense itself, answers, "No." God's will is NOT first in
   everything; it is NOT the spring and origin of wickedness. We affirm
   that all that is good and excellent and blessed has been originated by
   God. We affirm that God's will has already set in motion the entire
   mechanism of redemption, and has already prepared all things necessary
   for the present and everlasting happiness of sinners of mankind, and
   has already moved downwards to earth's guilty population, and finished
   the work of atonement for every man's sins, and has already provided
   the influence of the Blessed Spirit for every man's conversion, so that
   "ALL THINGS ARE NOW READY," and so that every sinner who voluntarily
   accepts of the provision thus graciously made, is justified and
   sanctified and saved solely and exclusively as the result of God's will
   taking the precedency of his will, and bringing to his very door a free
   and unmerited salvation. But we do not affirm, with Mr. Bonar, that the
   will of God takes the precedency of the wills of devils and of men in
   the introduction of sin and misery into the universe. The origin of
   evil is not left by this writer, or by his system of theology, as
   anything mysterious. It is by him accounted for most fully! It is by
   him traced back directly to God himself! And every word, therefore,
   which is uttered from the pulpit, and every sentence that is emitted
   from the press, by Calvinistic divines, which does not father all
   iniquity upon a holy God, is neither more nor less nor else than a
   denial and condemnation of their own unscriptural and false theology--a
   theology whose days are numbered, and which ought, long ere now, to
   have been for ever exploded.

   The question, therefore, is, Whether the will of God takes the
   precedency of created wills in EVERYTHING? and more particularly,
   Whether the apostle inculcates this doctrine in the Acts of the
   Apostles, by ascribing even THE WICKEDNESS of those who crucified the
   Lord of Glory to God's unalterable decree? This is the question which
   presents itself for our consideration this evening. In reply to the
   question, we solicit your patient attention to three observations.

   1. We submit, in the first place, that the apostle, in the passage
   referred to, ascribes to THE FOREKNOWLEDGE of God what has been
   improperly traced by Calvin and his followers to God's decree.

   We have seen, in our former discourse, that the system of Calvinism
   does not admit the possibility of God's foreknowledge of anything which
   he has not himself previously decreed. It teaches men to believe that
   nothing which God has not himself fixed by his decree can be certain,
   and, as a matter of course, that nothing which is uncertain can be
   foreknown. According to this system, God stands in need of a decree to
   enlighten his mind as to the events which are hid and concealed in the
   womb of futurity. Short-sighted men cannot understand how anything can
   be foreknown as certain, unless the almighty will of God be previously
   pledged to bring it into existence. And because the proud mortal cannot
   understand this, he presumes, as we have formerly seen, bluntly to deny
   the reality, and even the possibility of it.

   We humbly submit, that such a conclusion as this, is dictated by the
   most unreasonable vanity and pride. It is most unreasonable to deny the
   reality of a plainly revealed fact, simply because our limited
   capacities cannot apprehend the how and the wherefore of its existence,
   Presumption such as this, is happily no longer tolerated in our
   researches into the philosophy of matter, and the wonder is, that it
   should be tolerated and patronized, by intelligent men, when we come to
   investigate the philosophy of mind. And surely when we approach a theme
   so lofty as the philosophy of the infinite mind of the infinite
   Jehovah, it becomes us to lie low in the dust, and receive, like little
   children, the plainest statements of a well-accredited revelation. But
   this becoming spirit of humility seems to have been entirely cast aside
   by those who have hazarded the assertion, that the wickedness of our
   Saviour's murderers is said, by an inspired apostle, in the verses
   under consideration, to have been originated and decreed by God. They
   who discover in these verses any such statement as this, have come to
   the Bible with their preconceived notions, and, instead of testing
   their theory by the Word of God, they have interpreted the Word of God
   so as to suit their theory. They have come to these Scripture passages,
   not for the purpose of accommodating their system of theology to the
   Bible, but manifestly for the purpose of squaring and explaining the
   statements of the Bible so as to tally with their system of theology,
   and make the Word of God speak the language, and inculcate the most
   absurd and blasphemous tenets of Calvinism. Have these theologians not
   laid it down as an indisputable truth, that nothing can be foreseen as
   certain which does not happen to have been foreordained? Have they not
   taken it for granted, without any proof, that if anything can be said
   to depend on the will of man, or any created will, it is impossible
   even for Omniscience to apprehend its future certainty? Do they not
   freely speak even of GUESS WORK in connexion with omniscience, unless
   they are permitted to assume, and take it for granted, that everything
   which comes to pass has been decreed? This is what we call by the name
   of presumption. But it forms the source and origin of the false and
   erroneous interpretation, according to which "even the wicked deed of
   those who crucified the Lord of Glory" is said to have been "determined
   before by the hand and counsel of God." This is indeed the evident
   import of those two passages in the Acts of the Apostles, provided a
   man be entitled to take it for granted, that foreknowledge necessarily
   presupposes the existence of a foregone decree. But let this gratuitous
   assumption be called in question, and the verses under consideration
   utter no such response as that which falls upon Calvinistic ears. Deny
   the assumption, that whatever is foreknown must needs have been
   decreed, and look at the two passages of Scripture as they stand before
   you, and you find a very important distinction existing between the
   foreknowledge of God and the determinate counsel or decree of God; and
   then the inquiry remains, "WHAT did God FOREKNOW?" But this does not
   exhaust the inquiry, for another question presents itself, and it is
   this--"WHAT did God DECREE in connexion with the transactions of
   Calvary?"

   There is but one question, indeed, suggested by these verses, if any
   man may reasonably and justly confound the foreknowledge with the
   decree of God, and look upon them as embracing the self-same events.
   But if there exist an important distinction between foreknowledge and
   foreordination, so that anything may be certainly foreknown without
   having been absolutely decreed by an infinitely perfect God--if you
   grant the existence of such an important distinction as this, you must
   admit that there are two separate and distinct inquiries involved in
   the texts now under review. That such a distinction exists, is evident
   from the nature of the two things--the one involving no more than
   certain and simple apprehension, the other involving absolute and
   necessary causation; the one pointing to something which God knows, the
   other pointing to something which God causes and originates; and, as
   foreknowledge and decree are, in their own nature, separate and
   distinct, so they are distinctly and separately mentioned in the
   Scripture passages themselves.

   What, then, did God foreknow connected with the death of his
   only-begotten and well-beloved Son? In reply to this question, we call
   your attention to two observations.

   (1.) God foreknew, from eternity, with infallible certainty, all the
   wickedness which was exhibited by that ungodly generation.

   (2.) God foreknew, from eternity, with infallible certainty, the
   possibility of the men who acted wickedly refraining from their
   wickedness, and thinking and speaking and acting otherwise than they
   actually and certainly did.

   He foreknew, for example, that Judas would betray Christ, and that
   Peter would deny him; but he also foreknew that Judas might not have
   betrayed his Master, and that Peter might not have denied him. But, on
   the supposition that the wickedness which was exhibited in connexion
   with the sufferings and death of Jesus had been decreed or foreordained
   by God, it would not be true that such wickedness was foreknown
   otherwise than as absolutely and necessarily certain, and so it would
   not be true that God could foreknow the possibility of its
   non-existence. To recur to the familiar examples which we have selected
   for the sake of illustration, it would not be true that Judas might not
   have betrayed Christ, or that Peter might not have denied him, if these
   deeds of wickedness had been unconditionally decreed. It may here be
   said that God might have decreed otherwise than he did decree, and so
   that Judas might not have betrayed and that Peter might not have denied
   the Saviour. But you will not fail to observe, that this assertion is
   made, by those who make it, for the purpose of leading our minds away
   from the question which now faces us. That question relates not to the
   decree, but to the foreknowledge of God. We inquire not, whether it was
   possible for God to decree otherwise than it is said he did decree; the
   question is, Did God foreknow the possibility of the non-existence of
   the wickedness of which we speak? Did he foreknow the possibility of
   Judas not betraying, and of Peter confessing instead of denying his
   Lord? To this question, Calvinism has a ready answer. "He did not
   foreknow any such possibility." This reply is quite consistent with the
   theory. It springs necessarily out of the theory. The theory is that
   the decree is the foundation of the foreknowledge, so that God
   foreknows a thing because he has decreed it. But we are told that God
   decreed the wickedness--he fixed, by his decree, that Judas and Peter
   would certainly act precisely as they did act. But it was not possible
   for the decree of God to fail, therefore it was not possible for Judas
   not to betray or for Peter not to deny the Saviour. And if it was not
   possible for Judas and Peter to act otherwise than they did act, God
   could not, of course, foreknow it to be possible.

   When it is asserted, therefore, that both Judas and Peter might have
   acted differently, if God had been pleased to decree differently, you
   will see at once that this is saying nothing to the purpose. This is
   merely asserting the free agency of God for the purpose of evading the
   blunt and unequivocal denial of the free agency of man. We beg leave to
   hold our friends sternly to the point. When a man sins, they say truly
   that the man is verily blameworthy, because it was possible for him to
   have acted differently. We want no more of them than this good
   confession, and we merely insist upon their standing honestly by the
   obvious meaning of the words. They avow that it was possible for the
   man to have abstained from sinning. We press the question. What do
   these theologians mean when they avow the existence of such a
   possibility? Mark well, my friends, what is the reply which this
   theology affords to this plain and simple question: "It was quite
   possible for the man to have refrained from sin, because it is quite
   conceivable that God, if he had so chosen, might not have decreed that
   the main should commit iniquity"!! What is this but asserting the free
   agency of God, and at the same time denying the free agency of man? But
   the question is not whether God be a free agent;--the question relates
   to the free agency of men, The question is, "Is it possible for men to
   act differently than they do act when they choose to act wickedly?" And
   surely it is only a crafty and cowardly and dishonest evasion of this
   question to inform us, that "it was possible for God to have decreed
   differently"! Do we speak uncharitably, or do we speak honestly, when
   we say that this theology is a deception, and that its doctors and
   expounders practise a deception upon the minds and consciences of the
   people who follow in their wake? Speak they not daily as if they
   believed that man is a free and responsible agent? And, in saying this,
   do they not speak truly? But, under the guise of truth, do they not
   conceal a palpable falsehood? What is their meaning? They mean to say
   what their theology inculcates. They mean to assert the necessary
   dependence of man's will upon God's will "in everything, great or
   small," in this wicked world. They say to the sinner, that he might
   have refrained from sin, and that he ought to have refrained from it,
   but their meaning is, that, according to God's eternal arrangements, it
   was not possible for the man to have acted differently!

   When we, therefore, propose the question, "What did God foreknow in
   accordance with the statement embodied in the Acts of the Apostles?"
   our friends inform us that God foreknew what he himself decreed; but
   they tell us farther, that God decreed the wickedness. He could not,
   therefore, decree the possibility of the non-existence of the
   wickedness. He could not decree it to be quite possible that his own
   decree should fail. Surely not. Seeing, therefore, that God foreknew
   neither more nor less nor else than what he himself decreed, it follows
   that God, according to this theology, did not and could not possibly
   foreknow the possibility of the wicked men, who wickedly persecuted and
   blasphemed and crucified the Lord of Glory, acting differently in one
   single point, or refraining from one single act of sin. To recur,
   again, to our illustrations, God decreed that Judas and Peter should
   act as they did act, and he foreknew that they should so act, through
   the medium of his decree (which is said to be the foundation of his
   foreknowledge), and he did not and could not foreknow that Judas or
   Peter might have acted differently, for differently it was not possible
   for either of them to act without frustrating God's decree.

   Our appeal is now made to a host of witnesses. We appeal to every man,
   woman, and child on the face of the earth, not excluding our opponents
   themselves. We appeal confidently to every man's own consciousness. We
   ask every man to say, whether he is not conscious within himself that,
   when he sins, he might have refrained from sinning. Is it not upon this
   assumption that laws are framed? Does not the very existence of all
   law, human as well as divine, proceed upon the assumption, that it is
   quite possible for the subjects to obey them? And do not the pains and
   penalties appended to the transgression of every law, assume the
   existence of the possibility of the transgressor acting differently? Is
   it not every man's duty to obey a just and righteous administration,
   just because it is quite possible for him to obey it?--and is it not
   for this very reason that the transgression of a just law is justly
   punishable?

   Let the false philosophy which has been engrafted by Calvin upon the
   Word of God become dominant in society, and where are the safeguards of
   peace and good order and morality and liberty herself! They are
   overthrown and demolished by the rude hand of revolutionary ignorance.
   And who are the men who have trampled upon all law, human and divine,
   and waded through seas of blood to attain their revolutionary purposes?
   They have been those who have cast aside the Bible, and bad their minds
   poisoned and their consciences seared by the philosophy of Calvin. What
   is Socialism but Calvinism without a Bible? And what is Calvinism? What
   is it which characterizes this system and marks it out as a theology
   different from the system which we seek to advance? The Free Church
   minister, from whom we have quoted, has himself stated the question
   between this theology and the system which opposes it, by asking, "Is
   God's will first in everything?"

   But against this system of error we have our appeal. We have our
   appeal, as we have said, to the unsophisticated consciousness of
   universal humanity. The most hardened criminal carries along with him
   to the jail and to the scaffold the consciousness of blameworthiness,
   and this consciousness is based upon the innate conviction of the fact
   that HE MIGHT HAVE acted otherwise, and that it was quite POSSIBLE to
   have refrained from committing the crimes which have hurried him to an
   ignominious end. And does not the whole Bible, from beginning to end,
   proceed upon the principle for which we now contend? Does not every
   command and promise and threatening and blessed invitation of the Word
   of God proceed upon the great principle which universal consciousness
   attests, and demonstrate the truthfulness of our position, when we now
   maintain that every man who acts wickedly MIGHT act in consistency with
   conscience and the will of God?

   It is, therefore, a question which affects every man's interest for
   time as well as for eternity. Are you disposed, my friends, to be
   juggled out of all that is dear to you in time, and precious throughout
   eternity, by this false and juggling theology? See ye not to what an
   awful conclusion it conducts you? Perceive ye not the false philosophy
   on which this system of error is avowedly based? It is based upon the
   denial of the freedom of man's will, save in the sense that the will of
   man is necessarily dependent upon and regulated by the antecedent will
   of God "in everything." It informs a wicked and godless generation, as
   they pursue their downward course to hell, that "everything in this
   world happens according to God's eternal arrangements. Nothing takes
   place except what God causes to be, or permits to be, and whatever
   happens in time, is decreed from eternity. Even the wicked deed of
   those who crucified the Lord of Glory is said by the apostle to be
   determined before by the hand and counsel of God"!!

   But we confidently submit that the Apostle says no such thing. And it
   is, perhaps, necessary that we should in this connexion call your
   attention to the apparent discrepancy between the two passages in the
   Acts of the Apostles, on which this assertion is avowedly based. There
   is no obscurity hanging over the verse which is quoted from the second
   chapter of the Acts. That verse plainly refers to the foreknowledge, as
   separate and distinct from the decree of God. But the verse quoted from
   the fourth chapter refers not to foreknowledge at all, and is said to
   trace every wickedness to "the hand and the counsel of God." I need not
   inform you, however, that the translation of that verse is not
   inspired--that is to say, the Calvinists who translated the New
   Testament Greek into the English language, laid no claim to
   infallibility, even in their translation. The Greek Testament is as
   patent and open to us as it was to the translators. We therefore state
   what no man can truthfully deny, when we here affirm, that the verse
   quoted from the fourth chapter of the Acts is susceptible of a very
   different rendering, by a very simple and legitimate transposition of
   the words. We read it as we apprehend it ought to have been translated,
   when we read as follows:--"Of a truth, against thy holy child Jesus,
   whom thou hast anointed for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
   determined before to be done, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
   Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together." The verse,
   as thus rendered, does not ascribe to God's decree all that wicked men
   did, or any wicked thing that was done. It does not ascribe the
   execution of God's decree to men, but to the "holy child Jesus." He it
   was who was anointed for the express purpose of working out whatsoever
   the hand and counsel of God had determined before to be done. But
   should any of you prefer the translation as it stands, we submit that
   it does not affirm what Mr. Bonar says it affirms, even as it is read
   in our received translation. It does not say that God decreed
   "everything" which our Saviour's murderers chose to do, but it says
   that those wicked murderers were actually made instrumental in carrying
   into effect God's designs. They did not frustrate the great and
   gracious design of God in one single point, but even their undecreed
   wickedness was made subservient, not only to the frustration of what
   they wickedly hoped to effect, but even to the development of God's
   most wise and holy purposes. This we shall have occasion afterwards to
   remark upon more fully. In the mean time we have said enough to make
   good our position. We have endeavoured to convince you that the
   wickedness was not decreed, but simply foreknown. And that this
   wickedness was foreknown, not in the sense in which alone Calvinists
   admit anything to be foreknown,--not in the sense of having been
   absolutely and unconditionally decreed, and therefore foreknown. It was
   foreknown as undecreed and unoriginated and uncaused by a holy God. It
   was foreknown not only as certain, but as the certain result of free
   and responsible agents, who were not bound by any foregone decree to
   enact their wickedness, but who might have refrained their hands from
   wickedness, and their mouths from speaking guile. Herein, therefore,
   consists the error of this Free Church interpretation. This
   interpretation takes for granted what is not merely unproved, but what
   is actually disproved by every man's consciousness. It takes for
   granted that wickedness has been decreed by God, and therefore that its
   existence is necessary, so that it was not possible that it might not
   have been committed. And taking this for granted, this false system
   leads its abettors to pervert the Word of God, by ascribing to his wise
   and holy decree what the apostle, in the passages referred to, ascribes
   to his foreknowledge, and his foreknowledge alone.

   We need only further to remind you now, that foreknowledge, like
   afterknowledge, does not cause the existence of the object apprehended
   by the mind. It apprehends the certainty of the object, but it does not
   originate the certainty. You perceive the absurdity of imagining that
   your knowledge of the existence of the flood, or of the destruction of
   the cities of the plain, or of any other ascertained event which might
   be taken as a specimen, could possibly exercise any influence in
   bringing these events into existence. From the very Nature of the case,
   whatever is the object of knowledge, becomes known because it is
   certain. It is not rendered certain because it is known. You do not
   say, "I know it, and therefore it exists." You rather say, "It exists,
   and therefore I know it." But if you had the power and the will to
   bring anything into existence, and forthwith were to decree it--on this
   supposition you would say, "I decreed it, and therefore it came to
   pass." In this case, your decree would be the cause of its existence.
   It is evident, therefore, that whatever is known is no less certain
   than if it were decreed. But it is plain, for this very reason, that a
   thing does not need to be decreed in order to be certain. And if a
   thing may be certain without being decreed, the simple question
   remains--"Was it not possible for the divine mind to apprehend
   beforehand the free and independent and undecreed volitions of all his
   intelligent and responsible creatures?"

   There exists an important distinction between human actions simply
   foreknown, and the same actions apprehended after they have come to
   pass, which will, perhaps, serve to illustrate and confirm the position
   in support of which we have been arguing. The wickedness which is
   already past is apprehended, not merely as certain, but as something
   whose existence is now unavoidable, and, in that sense, necessary. But
   every past sin is known by the sinner himself to have been undecreed,
   because the sinner says truly in reference to his sin, "I might have
   avoided it." This is attested by every man's consciousness. He knows
   that he has sinned, but he knows too that he might have resisted the
   temptation whereby he was seduced. The sins, however, which are past
   and gone, possess a positive necessary being. It is not possible for
   Omnipotence itself to blot out the fact of their actual and ascertained
   existence. They are in this sense necessary or unavoidable, inasmuch as
   after they are committed, they cannot possibly be recalled. But it is
   not more easy for you to certify this fact, than it is to certify the
   other fact to which we have adverted--the fact that such sins might
   have been avoided. If the sinner could only know assuredly that he was
   necessarily and unavoidably impelled forward to the commission of sin,
   he could not possibly be the subject of remorse. Would not such a plea,
   if well substantiated, relieve him also from punishment? But what forms
   the gall and bitterness of the sinner's reflection upon his folly, is
   the consciousness that he might have acted otherwise. Will any
   sophistry erase from any man's mind the consciousness of the truth
   which I now state? It is impossible. Here, then, is
   certainty--infallible certainty; no "'mere guesswork," but absolute
   certainty--certainty converted into a positive necessity, by the actual
   existence of the object which is known. But here is something which
   might have been avoided, and which, therefore, was not necessary before
   it came into existence. It could not, therefore, be absolutely or
   unconditionally and eternally necessary; it could not be
   unconditionally and eternally decreed or foreordained.

   If, then, we speak of the actions of free and responsible agents before
   they come into actual existence, we must say of them that they may not
   come to pass, or, in other words, that their future existence is not
   necessary or unavoidable. But when we say this, we do not contradict
   the fact of their future certainty. They are certain, whether we
   suppose them to be known as past, or whether we foreknow them as
   future. The question which, on either supposition, remains to be
   solved, is--What is the cause or foundation of their certainty? Is this
   cause to be discovered in the decree of God, or is it to be sought for
   in man's free agency? This is the sole question which presents itself
   for solution; for there is no doubt about the certainty of whatever is
   apprehended or known, whether the objects known are past or future. If,
   then, the decree of God is the cause or foundation of the certainty, it
   is evident, that the objects apprehended beforehand as certain, must
   come to pass. They cannot possibly be avoided, for it will not be
   imagined that the decree of God can possibly fail. But sinful actions
   (of which we speak) are admitted to be among those things which might
   have. been avoided, even when they are contemplated as now and for ever
   necessary in point of actual existence--i. e., when contemplated as
   past and gone. If, then, they might have been avoided, they could not
   possibly be decreed by God. Their cause or origin must, therefore, be
   traced to the perverted and abused free agency of men, seeing that it
   cannot be traced to the decree of God, in which case their existence
   would from eternity have been necessary or unavoidable. It follows,
   therefore, that the foreknown volitions and actions of free agents are
   in no sense necessary or unavoidable, but that they may or may not take
   place, although they be from eternity apprehended as certain.

   You will observe from what has been now advanced, that strong and
   incontrovertible evidence of our present position lies within
   yourselves. You have the same evidence in support of what we have
   stated to you, which you have for your own existence; and it is just as
   easy for any man to convince himself that he does not exist, as it is
   to argue himself into the notion, that when he determines to walk in
   one direction, he cannot possibly determine to move in a different
   course. The consciousness of his own existence, which every man
   possesses, is one infallible witness to which now we make our appeal.
   And unless a man can honestly say, that whenever he sins against the
   dictates of conscience, he has only yielded to the force of a necessity
   which he could not possibly resist, we have that man's verdict
   decidedly in favour of what we now advance. The whole question resolves
   itself into this single point--"Was it not in my power to have
   determined differently?--Is there not something within me whose
   testimony no sophistry can contradict, which assures me that I might,
   and that I ought to have decided in a direction the very opposite?"
   When any man repents of his evil deeds, or even when he does not
   repent, but merely experiences internal remorse on account of his
   waywardness, does not that man confirm and substantiate, beyond the
   possibility of doubt, every statement which we make against the theory
   which falsely ascribes "everything" to God's unalterable decree?

   The entire Bible confirms and strengthens the testimony of universal
   consciousness. Men are there addressed and treated, throughout, as
   possessed of that entire freedom of will, the existence of which is
   denied by the theology now under review. They are commanded both to
   will and to do in a manner the very reverse of that which they
   generally, we might say, universally, choose to act. And all this
   clearly implies the possibility of men both determining and acting in a
   manner very differently, and pursuing a course the very opposite of
   that which is too generally followed. In reference to the future, the
   Word of God informs men that they may determine on a different course
   from that which is certainly foreknown, and we are thereby furnished
   with infallible proof to convince us that wickedness which is certainly
   foreknown, may not, after all, take place, but may be avoided, and is
   therefore undecreed of God. If it were decreed, it must of necessity
   happen, and the simple question is, whether the entire volume of
   revelation does not confirm the testimony of every man's consciousness,
   and exhibit the fact that men may not, and therefore should not, act
   wickedly. In reference to the past, the infallible Word bears the same
   infallible testimony. It condemns the sinful deeds of men, and its
   testimony finds an honest response in the sinner's bosom, when he is
   assured that he might and should have willed and acted, consistently
   with the will of God.

   But all such incontrovertible evidence is treated with contempt by the
   Calvinistic theology. This theology introduces a false and unscriptural
   theory among the soul-saving and soul-sanctifying truths of Scripture.
   It is taken for granted that "the will of God is first in everything,
   and that by God's immutable decree everything has been, from eternity,
   unchangeably and unconditionally fixed." And this false theory being
   assumed, and forced into unnatural connexion with the Word of God, the
   plainest truths in all the Bible are racked and tortured and mangled
   and destroyed, in order to make room for this monstrous and infernal
   conception of depraved imaginations. It is by elevating this hideous
   theory into the position of a first principle in theology, and twisting
   and perverting such texts as those now under consideration, so as to
   make them correspond exactly with this false principle, that our Free
   Church expositor falls into mistake, and blunders so egregiously, as to
   assert, that "even the wicked deed of those who crucified the Lord of
   Glory is said, by the apostle, to have been determined before by the
   hand and counsel of God." We hope we have said enough to convince you,
   that the wickedness referred to was not decreed, but was simply
   foreknown by God, and that foreknowledge embraced no antecedent decree,
   whereby the wickedness which comes to pass was unconditionally and
   divinely "fixed;" but, on the contrary, that the divine foreknowledge
   embraced the fact that this, and every other act of wickedness which
   disfigures the handiwork of God, it was, and is, and ever shall be,
   quite possible to avoid, up to the very moment when sin was, is, or
   shall be, brought into actual existence, by the undecreed and
   independent volitions of fallible and sinning creatures.

   II. Our second general observation is, that in the interpretation of
   the verses now under consideration, the followers of Calvin ascribe to
   the wickedness of men, what the apostle of Christ traces directly to
   God's decree.

   It is a remarkable fact that, like the Pharisees of old, our Free
   Church expositor and his friends turn the Bible upside down by their
   Calvinian traditions. They ascribe to God's decree what the Bible
   ascribes to the wicke4ness of men and devils, and they ascribe to the
   wickedness of men and devils what the Bible traces to God's unalterable
   and most holy decree. They thereby turn the entire Word of God upside
   down, and reduce its most blessed contents to one mass of inextricable
   confusion, and make it utter the most absurd and palpable
   contradictions. We have seen that those theologians ascribe all the
   wickedness of our Saviour's murderers to the decree of God, and we now
   remark, that they falsely ascribe the entire execution of God's decree
   to the wickedness of the men who reviled and persecuted and condemned
   and crucified the Lord of Glory. We say falsely, because it seems
   evident, from the word of God, that whatever God himself decreed, he
   himself carried into execution. What, then, did God decree? He decreed
   that Jesus should be, by himself, voluntarily delivered up into the
   hands of his enemies--that the wickedness of men should be signally
   defeated and frustrated, and that the men themselves should be made
   subservient to the working out of his most wise and holy and merciful
   designs.

   The question suggested by this observation is very simple--Did these
   murderers obtain possession of the person of Jesus Christ by their own
   power, or did they not? Was the act whereby he was led bound to
   Pilate's judgment-seat the act of men, or was it the act of God? Such
   is the question now before us. The question is not whether the
   wickedness which prompted the men to seek the Saviour's life was the
   act of God; the question is, whether the actual delivering up of
   Christ, as a prisoner, into their hands was the result of all this
   wickedness, or whether it was not the direct result of God's immutable
   decree. In order to help you to an answer, we may refer you to the
   first six verses of the eighteenth chapter of John's Gospel, where we
   are informed that--

   "When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples
   over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, and
   his disciples. And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place; for
   Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples. Judas then, having
   received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and
   Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
   Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went
   forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of
   Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which
   betrayed him, stood with them. As soon then as he had said unto them, I
   am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground."

   Here, then, is the most distinct answer to the question which I have
   now proposed. There was here a direct and miraculous interposition of
   Divine power, not to destroy the men, but to demonstrate to the
   universe the utter and the total powerlessness of all their wicked and
   malicious schemes. They had no power whatever to touch a hair of the
   Saviour's head. God could not, by an act of omnipotence, destroy their
   malice, or pluck out from their souls the rooted wickedness which was
   there. This, by an act of omnipotence, God could not do, but he could
   destroy their power to hurt, by laying them prostrate on the earth. And
   this he, for an instant, actually did, and he thereby proved that it
   was not their wickedness which triumphed over him, but his matchless
   love which triumphed over all their malice, and which prompted him
   voluntarily to deliver himself into their hands, in order that he might
   die a ransom for their sins. In the delivering up of the Son of God
   into the hands of his enemies, we do not therefore behold the result or
   even the forth-putting of human power, but we see the direct and
   voluntary act of God himself in the carrying into execution his own
   decree. True, indeed, the wickedness of the men was not arrested in its
   outrageous manifestation--true, indeed, their wickedness seemed to
   triumph--but the question is, Did it triumph? So far from this, the
   humanity was for a moment eclipsed amid the splendour of the divinity,
   and God himself appeared, before the eyes of angels, of devils, and of
   men, to do what the whole of them together had no power to carry into
   execution. And what was this, but voluntarily and directly himself to
   execute, by his own act of holy love, what he had from eternity
   purposed to, do, when he purposed to give his Son a ransom for all? It
   was not the act of the men, for "they went backward and fell to the
   ground." Here we behold the sole and exclusive act of God, when
   instantly, instead of being struck down into perdition, the men were
   enabled again to stand upon their feet, and received Christ a voluntary
   captive into their hands. Such, then, was emphatically the act of God
   himself, in the execution of his own decree.

   And so, when Jesus was before the judgment-seat of Pilate, what did he
   say? "Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were
   given thee from above." Thus again did Jesus enforce the principle,
   that he was delivered up, and went as a lamb to the slaughter, not in
   consequence of the rage and malice of devils and wicked men, but as the
   direct and exclusive result of his Father's immutable and eternal
   decree. "No man [said he] taketh my life from me. I lay it down of
   myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up
   again."

   Then, indeed, did "the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
   thing." What did they vainly imagine? They imagined that they were
   possessed of power enough to carry into execution their own diabolical
   purposes against the incarnate Son of God. They gathered themselves
   together in order to accomplish their own wicked ends, but all in vain.
   "He that sits in heaven" laughed them to scorn. The Lord did hold them
   in derision. See Psalm ii. He proved the utter impotence of all their
   rage--the total powerlessness of all their mighty and apparently
   formidable combinations; and this he did, even at the very moment when
   they seemed to triumph over him and his Anointed. On the one side,
   there were the devil and his angels--Judas and the Jewish
   people--Pilate and Herod and the Roman legions--and on what were they
   bent? They were bent upon the destruction of Jesus. They were leagued
   together in order to frustrate and overthrow the decree of God, the
   purport of which decree was, that his own Son should offer himself up a
   voluntary sacrifice, and lay down his life--not as a felon who is
   condemned to die--but as a conqueror, voluntarily flinging himself into
   the hottest of the strife, and breathing his last amid the shouts of
   victory,--a conqueror who, after entering into the dark abodes of death
   for a season, should grapple with the grim king of terrors himself,
   within his grim domain, and on the morning of the third day emerge
   triumphant from amid the gloom, crowned with the laurels of success,--a
   conqueror who should eventually ascend upwards, to take possession of
   the mediatorial throne, and wear the crown, and wield the sceptre, for
   evermore!

   Such was the decree of God. This was what "the hand and counsel of God
   determined before to be done." But Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
   Gentiles and the people of Israel, had no such ends or purposes in
   contemplation. The very reverse of all this was their unholy and
   malignant intent. But they were defeated--manifestly defeated--inasmuch
   as, in the first place, God did, in point of fact, himself accomplish
   what he decreed from eternity to do. This God himself did, in spite of
   all the rage of his enemies against him and his Anointed One. And, in
   the second place, God executed his own decree, and did his own work, in
   such a way--at such a time--and amid such a combination of
   circumstances, that it really seemed as if his enemies had been
   intentionally gathered together to do his work, which work they
   unwittingly and unintentionally forwarded and advanced. And thus it was
   that, at that very moment when they were raging and foaming and
   battling against him, they were made instrumental in forwarding and
   advancing "whatsoever the hand and counsel of God determined before to
   be done."

   But it was not the wickedness of those who crucified the Lord of Glory,
   whereby the eternal purpose of God was fulfilled even unintentionally
   on the part of those ungodly men. The wickedness was never decreed by
   God, and even in the hour of its apparent triumph, whatever was wicked
   and unholy, was most effectually and gloriously frustrated and
   overthrown. All that was sinful and malicious was traceable to the
   willing and the doing--the designing and the determining of the men,
   and all this was triumphantly defeated, even when it seemed to have
   effected its designs. All that was good and gracious, was but the
   development in time, of God's decree formed from eternity, and all this
   was most gloriously accomplished by God himself; so that while their
   wickedness was defeated, the very men who were fighting against God
   with all their might, were made subservient to the execution of his
   purposes.

   We have already hinted, that the verse which is erroneously supposed to
   father the wickedness of our Saviour's persecutors on the decree of
   God, and to teach that such wickedness was the actual fulfilment of
   that decree, is susceptible of a very different interpretation, by a
   legitimate alteration in the collocation of the words. But we
   intimated, at the same time, that even as the verse stands in the
   received translation, it does not inculcate the doctrine which has been
   erroneously founded upon it. [4] This will appear evident from the
   observations which have latterly been submitted for your consideration.
   It seems quite evident that Herod and Pontius Pilate and the Gentiles
   did most unintentionally do what God intended to be done. But in doing
   this, they did the very reverse of what they had wickedly determined.
   Their wicked designs were the very opposite of what God did not only
   decree, but carry into execution, in actual opposition to the
   determinations of wicked men. Granting, therefore, that the common
   rendering ought rather to be preferred, the verse which says to us that
   those wicked men did whatever God purposed, assures us by that very
   statement, that God did not decree any portion of their wickedness,
   seeing that such wickedness was frustrated and overthrown.

   So far, then, from informing us that "God foreordained whatsoever comes
   to pass," or hinting that "the will of God is first in everything," or
   announcing that "even the wicked deed of those who crucified the Lord
   of Glory was determined before by the hand and counsel of God,"--the
   inspired apostle intimates exactly the reverse, and that, too, in the
   verses which have been selected as the stronghold of Calvinism!

   It is evident, therefore, from the Word of God, as well as from the
   nature of the case, that the system of theology which is based upon an
   assumption such as that under examination, stands upon a sandy
   foundation. The storm of controversy which has happily begun to beat
   against the baseless tenement, and the tide of discussion which has
   already begun to rise upwards around its walls, must very speedily
   insure its downfall. It is not founded upon the Rock of Ages, and the
   sooner it is laid prostrate on the earth, and swept away for ever, so
   much the better for the interests of truth and the well-being of
   immortal souls.

   III. We submit, in the third place, that the interpretation which has
   been given of these two verses in the Acts, by the supporters of
   Calvinism, CANNOT POSSIBLY be correct.

   There are some statements which are so evidently inconsistent with
   truth, that every honest man is able to detect their falsehood the
   moment they are uttered. It needs little or no examination in order to
   pronounce them to be false and unfounded. And so there are some
   interpretations of the Word of God which are so manifestly inconsistent
   with the whole tenor and import of Scripture declaration, that every
   man who is in the slightest degree acquainted with his Bible, feels
   constrained, at the very first glance, to reject them and trample them
   under his feet, as perversions of the Word of God. As if the atheist
   should say to you that it is written in the first verse of the
   fourteenth psalm, that "there is no God"--appealing to the very Bible,
   which in such an event would be divested of all authority--in proof of
   his blasphemous assertion. On such a supposition as this, your reply
   would be instantaneous and unhesitating--"The fool hath said in his
   heart, there is no God;" but that there is a God all Nature speaks
   aloud through all her works, and to the voice of universal Nature, the
   entire volume of Scripture adds its unanswerable response. It is plain,
   at first sight, that whatever is evidently opposed to the universal
   testimony of Scripture and of conscience, cannot possibly be true. Of
   this nature is the interpretation of the two passages which we are now
   examining. According to this, we are called upon to believe that all
   the wickedness which takes place among men has its origin in the heart
   of God, and its original embodiment in the purpose of God, and is
   neither more nor less than the execution in time, of what God has
   purposed from eternity to bring to pass. This is what we are informed
   the Bible declares. And when any man startles at such an announcement,
   just as he shrinks from the reception of the statement--there is no
   God, he is informed, with a grave countenance and a pious whine, that
   God is sovereign, and it is his duty to receive as a truth the
   blasphemous declaration. But most certain it is, that every man who
   will listen to the voice of his own conscience (not to speak of the
   Word of God at all), must shrink back instinctively from the assertion,
   that God has himself originated every abomination which we call by the
   name of sin, by first decreeing its existence from eternity, and then
   himself executing his decree in the works of creation and providence,
   and thus by his omnipotence bringing it to pass in time. If there be
   any meaning in language, what is this but to assert that God himself is
   the active agent in the commission of all iniquity, and that he has
   deliberately purposed from eternity to bring it to pass! What are men
   but the passive instruments in his hand, to carry into execution
   whatever enormity his hand and counsel hath determined to do! What are
   the circumstances of time and the events of Providence amid which men
   are placed, but the means which God uses for the one purpose of hemming
   up their path and constraining them to perpetrate the innumerable acts
   of wickedness which he hath decreed to bring to pass! This is what we
   are called upon to believe; and not only so, but we are gravely
   informed that this is precisely what the Bible teaches us. Now I most
   unhesitatingly affirm, that it is as easy for any man so far to stifle
   his conscience, as to believe that there is no God at all, as to
   believe that there is such a God as Calvinism has set up. I put it
   fearlessly to your own consciences, and I ask you to say if you do not
   find it impossible to believe that God is not only the originator of
   all evil, but at the same time the great executioner of it--himself
   executing certain decrees which necessitate sin, in the works of
   creation and providence! But here is the fearful picture which you have
   set up before you, and which the writer, from whom I have quoted, calls
   a representation of God, and which he commands you to fall down and
   worship. He directs you to Pilate's judgment-seat, and to the
   blood-thirsty rabble who crowded around it. He points you to the
   innocent Jesus arraigned before that judgment-seat, and cruelly and
   unjustly charged with crimes of which he was guiltless as a lamb. He
   calls upon you to mark the deliberate villany of the men who knew that
   their victim was innocent, but who suborned false witnesses, and
   brought them forward to substantiate, by what they knew to be lies,
   their malignant charge. And what does this writer say to you, and what
   does he ask you to believe? He admits that all this is very wicked, and
   he asks you to condemn and execrate the atrocious deed. And so far it
   is well. But he instantly changes the scene. The curtain which
   concealed something else from your gaze is drawn aside. And what do you
   see? It is the image of a Being who has been behind the scenes,
   managing and ordering and arranging the dreadful tragedy. Here is the
   originator of the entire plot exhibited before you. The affair was all
   of his planning. He it was who originally decreed, and finally executed
   the whole. There stands the image of the Being who suggested and
   manufactured the false and infamous charge. He had power and resources
   enough at his disposal to shut up those ruffians falsely to prefer it,
   and he resolved to exert his ingenuity and power to that effect, He it
   was who hatched and ordained the infernal falsehoods whereby that
   unjust charge should be substantiated, and he took care so to order all
   events that those false witnesses should have their consciences seared,
   so as to stand prepared to swear to what they knew to be a lie. There,
   then, is the prime mover, and the secret executioner, of the whole
   behind the scenes. But what comes next before you? Who is this who
   seems ready to relent and set the victim of injustice free? It is
   Pontius Pilate himself. There is tenderness in his eye--there is
   compassion in his heart--there is a tremulous, hesitating sound
   proceeding from his lips. Ah he seems reluctant to condemn. What is
   that which fell from his lips? Surely--surely the innocent is
   acquitted, for PILATE has said, "I find no fault in him." He thinks of
   the fearful dream which, but the night before, had startled from her
   slumbers the wife of his bosom. He looks on that majestic
   countenance--calm and commanding in its consciousness of innocence,--he
   trembles to condemn, and, under the impulse of his better nature,
   Pilate exclaims, "I find no fault in him."

   But here, again, the scene is changed. Again the mysterious curtain is
   withdrawn by this modern teacher of modern Christianity. Again does
   this Free Church teacher point you to the Being who has decreed the
   whole, and who is secretly but infallibly directing the infernal plot.
   The heart even of Pontius Pilate relents, and fain would he set free
   the innocent. But this Being, whose image is held up before you, has
   bound down Pilate, by an iron decree, to dash the tear of pity from his
   eye, and stifle the sentiment of justice within his soul, and drown the
   voice of faithful conscience, as she urges him to let the victim go.
   And, in the execution of this decree, instantly, as if to drown the
   voice of imploring conscience, is Pontius Pilate forced to listen to
   ten thousand voices exclaiming, "Crucify him, crucify him! If thou let
   this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend." It is as if the bottomless
   pit were opened up, and all the fiends of hell let loose upon him, in
   order to force him to spill the blood of the innocent; and--there
   stands the originator of the whole!--the Being who has decreed all
   this!--the Being who has shut up Pilate to the necessity of doing what
   it is most evident he would not otherwise have done! And who is this
   Being who has urged on all this wickedness? What is his name? Alas!
   alas! that so many should call him GOD!!! SATAN is his proper name.

   I ask you to look at the text from the epistle of James, and see
   whether you have not there a very different picture of the Deity from
   that which is set before you by this most blasphemous interpretation of
   the two statements embodied in the Acts. The Holy Spirit says
   expressly, that God cannot so much as tempt any man to sin. But this
   disciple of Calvin declares that God does more than tempt--he shuts up
   men to the necessity of sinning, by an unalterable decree, even as his
   decree originated, and his omnipotence insured, the perpetration of all
   the wickedness of the men who shed the Saviour's blood!!

   Permit me, in conclusion, earnestly and affectionately to remind every
   one of my hearers, that there devolves upon each one of us a solemn and
   a tremendous responsibility, which, in the midst of this exciting
   controversy, we are too prone to forget. We are, each man and woman
   present, responsible to God for our own personal and individual
   salvation. This is what Calvinism teaches us to forget. It devolves the
   entire responsibility upon God, and takes it away from the consciences
   of men; and herein it appeals to the innate depravity and spiritual
   slothfulness of humanity, and to this circumstance alone it owes its
   popularity and its success. It feeds and it fattens upon the depravity
   of human nature, and to this alone does it owe its existence at the
   present hour. There is, my dear friends, a fatal tendency in human
   nature universally, to roll upon God the entire responsibility of
   everything that happens among men. There is a tendency, in our depraved
   and corrupted minds, to rid themselves of the burden of personal
   responsibility, and to sit or recline at ease under a gospel despised,
   and an atonement rejected, and a Holy Spirit resisted, and a sin-laden
   condemned soul still unconverted, and every moment exposed to eternal
   woe. There is a fatal tendency in every mind to shield itself from the
   stings and reproaches of a faithful conscience, under the hypocritical
   pretence of guarding the sovereignty, and intermeddling not with the
   province of God. You are, it may be, yet unconverted--yet unsaved--yet
   without "peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." And when
   conscience, faithful to her trust, would arouse you from your slumbers;
   and while the Holy Spirit says to you, "Behold I stand at the door and
   knock;" and while God himself is even beseeching you to be reconciled;
   what are you about? You are probably soothing your consciences by the
   hypocritical pretence of "WAITING GOD'S TIMES OR DAY OF POWER." See ye
   not that ye are thereby casting upon God the entire responsibility of
   your present unconverted--unsaved--God-dishonouring and
   Saviour-despising position? O my fellow-sinner, why wilt thou not open
   thine eye upon the great reality, and behold the God who loves your
   soul waiting--already waiting--compassionately waiting--WAITING FOR
   THEE? You do not need to wait another moment for thy God. He has waited
   long, and he is infinitely desirous even now for thy conversion, but we
   cannot say to any one among you, that he will wait another week or day
   or hour. "Behold, NOW is the accepted time; behold, NOW is the day of
   salvation." The entire responsibility of your present unsaved state
   rests entirely upon your own heads, and if you perish eternally, that
   system of error, whereby you are now deluded, will not come to your
   rescue in the place of woe, but you shall sink down to hell under the
   awful burden which now you seek in vain to shift entirely upon the
   decree of an Almighty God. On your own heads will rest your own soul's
   blood; and it will be too late to lament the day when you yielded up
   your souls to the influence of a false philosophy--a man-made
   creed--and wasted away your day of grace under the specious and
   hypocritical pretext of waiting upon that God who in reality is waiting
   for you. The man who tells you that it is not the sinner who moves
   first in the matter of conversion, tells you what is truth. But that
   man who says to you that God has not ALREADY moved forward, and has not
   ALREADY taken his place, and is not ALREADY propitiated and satisfied
   for your sins, and is not ALREADY waiting to receive you even now into
   the bosom of his love--that man, whoever he be, is a deceiver of your
   souls. THE FIRST STEP HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN by your God, and on
   yourselves alone now rests the tremendous responsibility of your soul's
   conversion. Ah! it will serve you nothing--if you continue determined
   in your present course, and rush onward to perdition--to say to your
   souls that you were not so presumptuous as to take the matter out of
   the hand of a sovereign God, nor so unorthodox in your creed as to be
   beforehand with God in your salvation. If you will not look at, this
   hypocritical pretext, this cunning slander against God's truth, in the
   light of the gospel revelation, you will see it clearly enough exposed
   and burned up by the flames of hell. You will see, when it shall be too
   late, that it was a mere device of Calvinism, to lull your conscience
   asleep for time, and pander to your innate depravity, and leave you at
   your ease without "PEACE WITH GOD." You will see that it was a foul
   slander against the truth of God to insinuate, that should you venture
   even now to believe in Christ as your atoning sacrifice, who died for
   your sins, you would be beforehand with God, and become your own
   Saviour, and anticipate and forestal the grace of the Spirit of God,
   without which, no sinner can indeed be saved. You will see that God was
   always beforehand with you, and anticipated your every want; and sent
   his Son to bear the punishment of your sins, that you might not
   yourselves be punished, but go free; and sent the Holy Spirit to point
   you to the finished work of Jesus, as the glorious and exclusive ground
   of your salvation. And you will see that all things being thus ready
   for your immediate conversion, you were yourselves responsible for
   doubting the truth of God, and hesitating and slumbering and perishing
   on the very threshold of salvation. If you will not open your eyes and
   look upon the delusions of a false theology now, and see it now exposed
   by the light of the gospel, you shall ere long see its falsehood
   exposed in the fires of perdition. Depend upon it, my friends, that ON
   YOUR OWN PRESENT CHOICE, and that alone, does your present and eternal
   well-being Now depend. "All things are ready." "Choose ye this day whom
   ye will serve." GOD THE FATHER is willing, GOD THE SON is willing, GOD
   THE SPIRIT is willing. On your OWN WILL, therefore, hangs Now your
   everlasting destiny. And the theology which would teach you to wait or
   hesitate or procrastinate, as if either the Father or the Son or the
   Spirit needed to be waited upon, in order to be made willing to save
   you, or as if all that is needful for your immediate pardon were not,
   on the part of God, ALREADY FINISHED, or as if the will of God had not
   ALREADY ANTICIPATED your will, and is not ALREADY MOVING for your
   rescue,--the theology which blasphemously assumes that all things ARE
   NOT READY for your immediate acceptance, and for the immediate
   acceptance of every sinner on this side of hell, and which would scare
   you away from salvation by the pharisaical pretence, the hypocritical
   whine, about the imaginary sin and danger of YOUR WILL going before,
   and moving heavenward, independently of THE WILL OF GOD--such a
   theology is the most successful instrument whereby Satan deceives and
   ruins precious and immortal souls. Depend upon it, that if you are
   still doubting, and without peace in the prospect of meeting God, the
   fault is ALL YOUR OWN. The cause in not with God, but with yourselves.
   You have the power to will this moment your own salvation. And it will
   be said to you, when it is too late, if you shall live and die unsaved,
   not that God was ever unwilling, but


     "THE CHOICE YOU MADE has fixed your doom;

     For this is Heaven's decree,

     That with the fruits of what he sow'd

     The sinner fill'd shall be."

     --Par. X., on Prov. i. 20-31.

   Already has God come down to you, and even now he waits and entreats
   and strives most earnestly for your salvation. THE DECISION NOW RESTS
   ENTIRELY WITH YOURSELVES.

   [4] On Acts iv. 27, 28, Dr. Payne observes--"This is a case, as it is
   said, in which sinful actions are spoken of as the consequence of a
   Divine decree. Now, I do not avail myself of a different collocation of
   the words, proposed by some eminent scholars, which bring out the
   statement, not that Herod and Pontius Pilate, &c., were gathered
   together to do what the counsel of the Lord had determined, but that
   Christ was anointed to accomplish all this. I do not avail myself of
   this, both because it is unnecessary to resort to this altered
   collocation of the words, and because there can be no doubt that the
   salvation of men, by the crucifixion of the Son of God, was a Divinely
   appointed event. . . . . . In this case, the Divine decree extended to
   the giving up of the Saviour into the hands of his enemies, but not to
   the treatment which, when thus given up, he received from them. Known
   unto God are all his works, and all the power, the thoughts, the
   feelings of men, from eternity. He knew the precise state of mind of
   Herod and Pontius Pilate, &c. . . . . And yet, knowing all this, he
   sent, his Son into the world; he determined to send him into the
   world--determined to surrender him to the malice of his
   enemies. . . . . Though HE DID NOT DECREE that Herod and Pontius
   Pilate, &c., should bind and bruise and crucify the Saviour, he did
   decree that the Saviour should be given up to their cruelty and
   vengeance. His decree, in short, extended to what he did in this
   transaction, but NOT TO WHAT MEN DID. . . . . Jehovah perceives how
   that principle, which is the prolific source of all evil, will develop
   itself in every conceivable variety of circumstances. And it is
   perfectly easy for him so to arrange his providential dispensations, as
   that the ungodly passions of men shall prove the instruments of
   accomplishing his merciful purposes, without decreeing that these men
   shall be the subjects of this depravity, or that their unholy passions
   shall develop themselves in that particular manner; or, I add, without
   DECREEING TO PERMIT either the one or the other. All that God does in
   the business, is the subject of decree; all that man does is not the
   subject of decree."--Lecture VI., on Sovereignty, pp. 125-127.

LECTURE FIFTH.

   THEORY SECOND, OR ELECTION TO A SPECIAL OR EXCLUSIVE INFLUENCE OF THE
   HOLY SPIRIT--THIS THEORY EQUALLY UNSCRIPTURAL WITH THAT FORMERLY
   EXAMINED--SUBVERSIVE OF THE UNITY OF THE GODHEAD.

   ISAIAH v. 3, 4.--"Judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What
   could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?"

   EZEKIEL xxxiii. 11.--"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure
   in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and
   live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O
   house of Israel?"

   MATTHEW xxxiii. 37.--"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the
   prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I
   have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
   chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"

   WE proceed now to call your attention to the second general theory of
   election. The theory already examined, claims for the elect a special
   and exclusive interest in the death of Christ. It affirms that Jesus
   shed his blood upon the cross for the elect alone. The doctrine now to
   be examined, claims for the elect a special and exclusive interest in
   the work of the Spirit. It affirms that the Spirit of God exerts his
   influence upon the minds of the elect alone, and that the Spirit
   strives with none of the human race excepting the elect, with the view
   of bringing them to salvation. This theory has been resorted to with
   the view of reducing the doctrine of Calvin to a more seeming
   consistency with the Word of God, and of rendering its dogmas somewhat
   more palatable to the generality of mankind. The school of theologians
   by whom this doctrine has been patronized, have been sometimes
   distinguished by the name of "Moderate Calvinists," while they who have
   pled for a limitation of the atonement of Christ, as well as for a
   limitation of the influence of the Spirit, have been styled,
   "Ultra-Calvinists." The great difference between these two parties
   consists in this--the Moderate Calvinist affirms that Jesus died
   equally for all men, while the Ultra-Calvinist denies this affirmation,
   and contends that Jesus died for the elect only. We have, therefore,
   one set of Calvinists contradicting another set of Calvinists, on what
   is, beyond all question, the most important doctrine of
   Christianity--the doctrine of the atonement.

   The doctrine, then, which falls now to be considered, proceeds upon the
   fullest admission of the great truth, that the Son of God shed his
   blood for every sinner of the human race. This is an admission which
   the greater proportion of professed Calvinists have latterly felt
   themselves constrained to make. The men have been latterly shut up to
   this conclusion by the force of truth, and the rapid advance of
   Scripture knowledge among the great bulk of professing Christians.
   There are few men who have given to the all-important inquiry the
   slightest investigation, without perceiving, at a glance, that since
   the death of Christ is the only Scriptural and consistent ground of the
   gospel offer, the atonement must of necessity be as extensive as the
   offer; and therefore, considering that the offer of pardon and
   salvation is made to all men, the Saviour of the world must have died
   for all men. The atonement is the foundation of which the gospel offer
   is the superstructure; and the great bulk of theologians have been
   compelled to admit, that the foundation must be as wide as the
   superstructure; so that already, in the progress of the discussion, the
   Ultra-Calvinists have been left in a small and humiliating minority.
   But while this doctrine admits the universality of the death of Christ,
   it still maintains the limitation of the influence of the Spirit. It
   has the appearance of greater liberality and freeness, and comes to men
   with a far more imposing and generous aspect, than the doctrine which
   we have already discussed. We shall see, however, that all this
   liberality and all this vaunted consistency with the universal call of
   the gospel to all men without exception, is more in appearance than
   reality, and that this half-and-half theory--this measure of a crooked
   and halting policy--is no less decidedly contradicted by the Word of
   God, than the theory which the middle men have been constrained to
   forsake and to condemn.

   I. WE OBSERVE, IN THE FIRST PLACE, THAT THIS DOCTRINE RETAINS SOME OF
   THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE PRINCIPLES OF THAT UNSCRIPTURAL THEORY WHICH WE
   HAVE ALREADY EXAMINED.

   There can be no doubt that it is a most important truth which is
   admitted, when it is conceded that Jesus died for all. And there is in
   the admission of this great truth, a clear way of escape from the
   unscriptural position, that God, in any case, is bound in justice to
   justify those sinners for whom the Saviour died. And thus far this
   theory is free from one fatal objection, to which, as we have seen, the
   former theory stands exposed.

   But, while the doctrine now under consideration adopts and recognises a
   great and important truth, it retains and embraces a great proportion
   of the error with which we have already proved the former theory to be
   burdened. It rejects one part of the error of Calvin, but it retains
   another part of the same error; and while it leaves men in a position
   no less hopeless than that in which it found them, this theory wants
   the consistency of the system which it professes to supplant. It agrees
   with the former in tracing whatsoever comes to pass to the sovereign
   pleasure and the unalterable decree of God. It asserts, indeed, that it
   was the will of God to give his Son to die for all men, and in
   asserting this it admits a very important truth; but it asserts, at the
   same time, that God has, in sovereignty, decreed and purposed to
   withhold his Spirit from all men except the elect, and in asserting
   this it retains a very important error. This theory does not say that
   God executes his decree, and carries into effect his determination to
   condemn all save the elect, by giving up his Son to die for the elect,
   and the elect alone. It affirms that Christ died for the non-elect as
   well as for the elect, but that God has unconditionally decreed that
   the former shall not be saved, and therefore he has purposed to keep
   back from them the influence of the Spirit. You will notice, therefore,
   that this doctrine leaves men in exactly the same position in which it
   found them--under an absolute impossibility of being saved--unless it
   be true that men can indeed be saved without the influence of the Holy
   Spirit, and in direct opposition to the sovereign purpose and eternal
   decree of Jehovah.

   Now my question is this--Wherein does this theory differ practically
   and fundamentally from that other theory which we have, in our former
   Lectures, proved in your hearing to be utterly opposed to the
   Scriptures of truth? I have already granted that it does differ, in
   mere theory, from that which has been already shown to be unscriptural,
   but the question is--Where lies the practical difference? There is, I
   admit, a greater sound of liberality and Scripture consistency, but my
   question is--Whether all this apparent and vaunted liberality does not
   amount to mere empty sound, and nothing more? There is a great
   admission, I grant you, when the doctrine, that Jesus died for all men,
   is no longer denied; but the question is--Whether the poison be not
   mingled with the wine?--whether the great doctrine of Christ's death
   for all men be not paralyzed and destroyed, and rendered practically
   useless to the souls of men, by being associated with the exhibition of
   a dark decree, whereby all men, except the elect, are shut out and
   expelled from the very possibility of tasting the benefits of the great
   atonement? Permit me to read to you one short extract from an eminent
   living divine--a divine who has written one of the best treatises for
   the express purpose of establishing the great and glorious doctrine,
   that Jesus died for all men, without one solitary exception. "The
   brethren of Joseph spoke truly of themselves [says Dr. Wardlaw] when
   they whispered one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
   brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us,
   and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.'
   Conscience was in the right. They were verily guilty. And yet it was
   the purpose of God, by means of their unbrotherly envy and cruelty, to
   fulfil his prophetic declarations to Abraham respecting the future
   history of the nation that was to spring from his loins. It was not the
   less their duty to be affectionate and kind to their brother, that such
   affection and kindness would have disarranged and frustrated the whole
   counsel of God; nor was it the less their sin to violate the claims of
   fraternal love, that by such violation they fulfilled it."--Discourses
   on the Atonement, p. 184.

   Be pleased, then, to mark well what is here said. Had the brethren of
   Joseph not done what was sinful, the divine decree would have been
   disarranged and frustrated; and in doing what was sinful, these men are
   said to have been acting in consequence of, and consistently with, the
   immutable purpose and decree of God!

   Now, we have already endeavoured to prove that such a doctrine is
   opposed to the plainest declarations of Scripture, and cannot possibly
   be true. It is a libel upon the character of God, and is opposed to the
   common apprehensions of mankind. The writer from whom I have just
   quoted says, that the decree and counsel of God would be frustrated if
   men did not act wickedly. If the murderer did not murder his victim--if
   the adulterer did not indulge his licentious passion--if the drunkard
   did not quench his unnatural thirst--if the blasphemer did not utter
   his horrid blasphemy--if, in a word, all things did not happen exactly
   as they come to pass, the decree and purpose of God would be
   frustrated!! And what is this, but just to embrace the most horrible
   doctrine of Ultra-Calvinism? It is for the express purpose of leaving
   room for the free and necessary execution of such horrible decrees,
   that the supporters of this theory find it necessary to limit and
   circumscribe the Holy Spirit, in his strivings with mankind. They do
   not like to say that--God actually exerts his power for the purpose of
   insuring the sin and the damnation of his creatures. To assert this
   would not be very expedient! They choose rather to present the horrid
   conception in a milder and more palatable form. He only keeps back his
   Spirit, and withdraws his grace. He sees that if his Spirit were to
   plead with men, they would not act wickedly. He determines, however,
   that the wickedness shall come to pass; and if it were not to come to
   pass, his purpose and decree would be frustrated. And so, in order to
   insure the commission of the wickedness, he has resolved, in
   sovereignty, to leave the men without the Spirit--without which he
   knows they will be sure to transgress. This is the form in which the
   decree of God is presented before us by the expediency theory of which
   we speak. And I now put it to your candid and unprejudiced judgments to
   say, if there be not here a full development of the most hideous error,
   I had almost said blasphemy, of the system which we have already proved
   to be unscriptural. If the murderer shall place his victim in a
   situation in which he has so arranged that the man shall necessarily
   die, and from which all that is necessary for the sustenance of
   existence is withdrawn, he is no less truly a murderer than if, with
   his own hand, he had plunged the dagger into his bosom. King David did
   not, with his own hand, murder Uriah the Hittite--he only ordered the
   man to be placed in the front of the battle, and the necessary
   assistance to be withheld from him. But the mode in which the murder
   was committed, did not alter the nature of the deed. And so here, when
   we are informed that God does not infuse sin into men's minds by a
   direct act of his omnipotence, but that he has decreed the wickedness,
   and only brings it to pass, by withholding the one only influence
   needful to prevent it--we do not discover any real difference between
   this doctrine and that other theory which has been formerly examined
   and condemned by the plainest statements of God's own Word.

   But while there exists no real difference between this middle theory
   and that extreme doctrine formerly considered, I do most earnestly
   entreat you, my beloved friends, to compare them both with the strong
   and emphatic declarations embodied in the two passages of Scripture to
   which your attention has been directed. Does God himself not appeal to
   men, and ask them there what more he could do for his vineyard which he
   hath not done? What, then, is the reply which this theory makes to this
   important question? It says that God could have done far more for
   sinners who perish than what he has done or purposed to do. It informs
   us most distinctly that God could, if he had so chosen, have given to
   his vineyard the dews of the Divine influence, but this he has, in
   sovereignty, purposed to withhold. He knew well that if the influence
   of the Spirit had been given to his vineyard it would bring forth
   grapes in rich abundance. He knew well that if the influence of the
   Spirit was withheld and kept back from his vineyard, it would bring
   forth wild grapes. He purposed from eternity that it should bring forth
   wild grapes and thorns and briars, and every noxious weed; but to
   bestow the influence of the Spirit--to cause the dew to descend upon it
   from on high, would be most effectually to frustrate and disarrange his
   high counsel, and therefore we are informed he withholds the special
   influence. I appeal to those plain texts of Scripture, which I have
   read in the outset, against such an exhibition as this gives us of the
   character of our God. I do not deny God's right and title to keep back
   and withhold from men the influence of his Spirit. I do not deny that
   God, if he were treating us as we deserve, would never approach us more
   with the gentle drawings or the earnest strivings of his grace. O who
   can deny all this, or presume to say that we have any claim, in
   justice, to one single manifestation of the Holy Spirit to our souls!
   But all this does not render the doctrine we are now considering one
   shade the brighter. This admission only manifests more clearly and
   decidedly its dark and odious features, and brings it out more
   prominently in all its dreadful and hideous deformity. We can lay no
   claim whatever to the influence of the Holy Spirit, for God might in
   perfect equity most justly withhold it from us all. Let this be most
   readily granted, for verily this is most true; and yet the question
   still remains, does God condescend to treat men as they have no right
   to be treated as respects the influence of the Spirit--that blessed
   influence, without which no fruit of holiness can possibly take root
   and flourish within the human soul? If God does not keep back his
   Spirit, but if that Spirit does, in point of fact, strive with wicked
   and ungodly men--although we do admit that men have no claim to his
   influence--is it not for this very reason all the more sinful, and all
   the more cruel, and all the more blasphemous in the Church to deny and
   hide from the eyes of perishing men this most wonderful act of
   Sovereign Grace? The very circumstance that men do not deserve the
   influence of the Spirit, and that God would do them no injustice were
   he to withhold it, renders the enormity of the crime a thousand-fold
   more glaring, on the part of men, when they presume to say that this
   needful influence is withheld. Now, if it had been kept back from
   wicked men God could not have been blamed; but this we do most
   unhesitatingly affirm, God could not appeal to men as he does, and ask
   themselves to say what more it was possible for him to do for them
   which he hath not done, in order to bring them to repentance. This God
   could not, and would not say, if he did, in point of fact, withhold
   from them the very influence needful for their return to himself. Would
   it in this case be presumption in men to reply, in answer to this
   earnest and touching appeal, "True, O God, thou hast given thy Son to
   die for us, thy vineyard--true, thou hast most graciously addressed to
   us thy blessed gospel call--true, thou art under no obligation to thy
   vineyard to visit it with the dew of thy influence--but, O Lord, thou
   knowest that without this we cannot bring forth fruit unto thy glory,
   and thou canst do something more for thy vineyard which thou hast not
   yet done--thou canst impart the influence of the Spirit; and now,
   seeing that thou hast most graciously appealed to thy vineyard itself,
   and called upon men to say what more thou canst do that thou hast not
   done, grant but this one farther influence, and we shall instantly
   flourish and bring forth fruit, and appear fair and lovely as the
   garden of the Lord." I ask any man to say if this is not the precise
   reply which wicked men would be in a position to give to the question
   which our God has most graciously condescended to propose. But what is
   the rejoinder which the doctrine we are now considering puts into the
   lips of God? It makes God say that all this is very true, but
   nevertheless he has made a decree whereby These wicked men must
   necessarily and inevitably sin against him and be damned, and this
   decree would be frustrated and disarranged (to use the words of the
   writer already quoted) if the needful influence was not kept back; and
   therefore, while it is most true that he could do something more to his
   vineyard, he has determined, in sovereignty, that the one thing needful
   shall not be done! I now most solemnly appeal to you, men and brethren,
   in vindication of the injured and maligned character of our God; and I
   call upon you to decide in the face of God's own word, and this evening
   to say whether such a doctrine as this be not utterly inconsistent with
   its plainest, and most obvious, and most impressive announcements. I
   add to this appeal to his own vineyard the oath of God himself, wherein
   he most emphatically contradicts the doctrine which has been palmed
   upon his Church--"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in
   the death of the wicked; but rather that the wicked turn from his way
   and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O
   house of Israel?"

   Brethren, the question is a solemn one--and it is a question which will
   meet you at the judgment-seat. Will ye any longer set aside the oath of
   Jehovah himself, by lending your ears or your influence to perpetuate
   and uphold the mere traditions of fallible men?

   II. I OBSERVE, IN THE SECOND PLACE, THAT THIS THEORY OF ELECTION IS
   STILL MORE OBJECTIONABLE THAN THAT WHICH WE HAVE FORMERLY EXAMINED,
   INASMUCH AS IT INFRINGES UPON THE UNITY OF THE GODHEAD.

   According to this doctrine, we are informed that God the Father so
   loved the whole world, without exception, as to give up his own Son to
   die in its stead. We are farther informed, that God the Son regarded
   from eternity the whole human race with an equal regard, so that He, in
   the fulness of the time, came, and voluntarily offered up himself the
   propitiation, not for the sins of the elect only, but also for the sins
   of the whole world. All this is most fully admitted by the brethren who
   adhere to, and support the theory of election now under consideration.
   This they have found it impossible to deny. The storm of controversy
   within their own church [5] has literally driven them to the admission
   of this much of the great and glorious truth. But, in place of sailing
   into the safe and peaceful haven which was open for their reception,
   they have been drifted upon the rocks and the sand-banks of error, by
   turning round in order to embrace the great fundamental delusion now
   before us. Their position is no better than it was before; nay more, it
   is, if possible, still worse, and must inevitably prove still more
   disastrous. For what does this theory involve? It involves the denial
   of the same mind in God the Spirit, which they are compelled to look
   upon as dwelling in God, the Father and God the Son. The love of the
   Father and the work of the Son they now see to be universal--wide as
   the world--embracing in its ample bosom the entire family of man,
   without distinction and without exception. But their Confession of
   Faith informs them that God has determined to send down to destruction
   the greater portion of the human family, and that from all those whom
   he has created and brought into the world for damnation, God
   withholdeth his grace, and exposeth them to such objects as their
   corruption makes occasion of sin; and farther, gives them up to their
   own lusts, to the temptations of the world, and to the power of the
   devil--all in order to prevent the possible frustration, and the sure
   and certain execution of his own decree. And so, in order to preserve
   the credit of a man-made creed, the third person in the blessed Godhead
   is arrayed against the other two; and while the love of the Father and
   the love of the Son embraces the whole world, the love of the Holy
   Spirit is restricted and confined solely and exclusively to the elect!
   The wishes, and the desires, and the gracious efforts of the Holy
   Spirit, are not by any means co-extensive with the wishes, and desires,
   and amazing efforts of the Father and the Son for the salvation of
   mankind! That God the Father earnestly and sincerely desires, or wills
   that all men should be saved, is unanswerably argued by the upholders
   of this doctrine from the Word of God. They argue, with the inspired
   apostle, that God has proved that--he wills all men to be saved, by the
   fact that he has given his Son a ransom for all men. They point to the
   death of Jesus for every sinner of the human race, and they do most
   triumphantly conclude therefrom, that God the Father and God the Son do
   most earnestly and sincerely desire every sinner on the face of the
   earth to be saved. But when they come to the work of the Holy Spirit
   they say, that this great work is limited and circumscribed. And just
   as from the work of the Son they argue out the desire, the earnest
   desire of God, that all for whom his Son was given to die should
   believe and live, even so are we taught to measure the desire and the
   wish of the Spirit. The Spirit, accordingly, does not wish all men to
   be saved! The Spirit's work and effort is the measure of his love. And
   since his work and his effort to save does not extend beyond the number
   of the elect, we have the Holy Spirit represented as not willing that
   any one single soul, beyond the number of the elect, should come to the
   knowledge of the truth and be saved from impending ruin. Here, then, is
   the desire and the wish of both the Father and the Son opposed and
   counteracted by the desire of the Spirit!

   Here is the Father parting with his only-begotten and well-beloved Son,
   just because he desires to save a world from perdition; and here is the
   Son parting with his glory for a season, and hum. bling himself even to
   the death of the cross, and doing enough by his death for the salvation
   of the whole race; but here is the Spirit of truth refusing to work and
   to put forth his influence upon the Souls of multitudes for whom the
   Saviour died! Behold, my friends, the horrible representation!
   Transport yourselves, in imagination, to the ancient city, which was
   crowded with the murderers of our Lord, and see the Saviour weeping
   over the guilty crowd of infatuated men and women who were madly
   rushing onwards to an undone eternity. Hear the Saviour uttering, from
   his inmost soul, the plaintive cry--"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that
   killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how
   often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen
   gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" Mark the
   emphatic words, "ye would not." It is not, "My Father would not"--it is
   not, "I would not." I say more--it is not, "The Holy Spirit would not
   impart to you the needful influence." The sentiment of Jesus is, "I
   would, and God the Father and God the Spirit would, but you have
   yourselves alone to blame for the rejection of salvation: ye would
   not--ye will not--come to me that ye might have life." But fancy to
   yourselves one of our modern theologians, who have mixed up with the
   water of life the poison of a false and unscriptural fatalism--who have
   set the writings of Plato, or the ravings of Aristotle side by side
   with the Word of God, and have learned to say, that "whatsoever comes
   to pass" must necessarily happen, otherwise men would be far stronger
   than God, and overthrow the irreversible decree!--fancy to yourselves
   some of these men side by side with the weeping Saviour, when his heart
   was bursting and breaking over the wickedness and infatuation of the
   men and women whom he tend to save;--would they not have counselled him
   to dry up his tears? Would they not have enlightened his mind upon the
   philosophy of the whole plan? Would they not have asked him to tell
   them, whether his tears and lamentations could alter or turn back the
   Divine decree? Would they not have corrected his mistake when he
   exclaimed, in tenderest and most earnest accents, "Ye would not"? And
   would they not have directed him to the Great Spirit, who sits behind
   the entire machinery of nature, and whose influence alone was awanting
   in order to fill the entire city with his followers--whose influence
   alone was needed in order to transform every blaspheming Jew into a
   genuine convert, and fill the atmosphere around with the most rapturous
   hallelujahs and sounds of praise? would they not have exclaimed, "Say
   not to those Jews,' YE would not.' Point them to the Holy Ghost, and
   say,' HE would not,' because if He would, the decree which binds you
   down to the necessity of playing your part in this dreadful tragedy
   would be frustrated and overthrown!

   "Men and Brethren, I do this night appeal to you in the name of God,
   and I ask you to say, whether will you give credit to the weeping
   Jesus, or will you still abide by the blasphemous dogma of an infidel
   philosophy which has been artfully engrafted upon the pure and
   unadulterated Word of God? It is the fatalism of the ancient heathen
   philosophers, which has been imported into the Christian Church during
   a dark and backsliding age. The dogma of fatalism was introduced by
   Satan into the schools of theology, and by mixing up the doctrine of
   necessity or fatalism with the Word of the living God, the great
   deceiver of souls has forged a strong and a heavy chain, whereby he
   leads thousands to destruction. And what has the Church done? She has
   imported her creed, to a great extent, from the dark bosom of the
   papacy. Who was Calvin? and who were the Reformers? They were mighty
   men, it is true, but still they were only men. And what had these men
   not to do? They had to battle against ten thousand deadly errors. And
   is it any wonder that they were not a match for every one of them?
   Consider the dark atmosphere amid which they lived and moved, and the
   wonder is, not that these mighty men of God brought out of the papacy
   so much of deadly error; the wonder is that they were the means of
   exhibiting, in their day and generation, so great a proportion of
   precious truth. And what, I ask, have the churches of the reformation
   done since the days of these mighty men? Have they followed up the
   movement which these reformers began?--have they subjected every
   doctrine to the scrutiny of the Word of God?--have they put their human
   creeds into the fining pot, and separated the dross from the pure gold?
   No. We have verily proved ourselves a race of weak and degenerate men.
   The children of the reformation have not followed the footsteps of
   their nobler fathers. We have taken their creeds, and we have set them
   up as if they were the infallible word of God. And if ever any spark of
   life has been manifested since the days of the fathers of the
   reformation, it has been the life which is only the manifestation of
   spiritual death--the life and the activity of men who arouse themselves
   to exertion only when it is necessary to expel from their churches
   those who would presume to question the infallibility of the Confession
   of Faith!--who would dare to "try all things by the Word of God, and
   hold fast only that which is good"! There are many of the doctrines in
   these Confessions which are precious; but who could expect that there
   should be nothing that is wrong? And I, therefore, earnestly and
   affectionately call upon you to say, whether you will abide by the
   words of God himself, and take his assurance and oath, that he
   withholds nothing from you that is necessary for your salvation; or
   whether you will take the word of men, when they tell you, that except
   ye happen to be included in the decree, which the imaginations of
   infidel philosophers hath conjured into being, the Holy Spirit
   withholds from you that influence which is indispensable to salvation.
   Choose ye this day whom ye will believe. If the Lord Jehovah be true,
   when he swears by himself that he desires your life, believe him; but
   if fallible men be true when they hold out a dogma which contradicts
   the oath of Jehovah, believe them.

LECTURE SIXTH.

   THIS THEORY OF ELECTION INVOLVES THE DENIAL OF THE NECESSITY OF THE
   INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN ORDER TO CONVERSION--QUOTATIONS FROM
   MR. HENTON AND DR. WARDLAW.

   JOHN vi. 44.--"No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath
   sent me, draw him."

   JOHN ix. 41.--"If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say,
   We see; therefore your sin remaineth."

   JOHN iii. 18.--"le that believeth not is condemned already, because he
   hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God."

   THE verse which has first been read informs us that, without the Holy
   Spirit, no man can believe; the verse next quoted informs us, that if
   men could not believe, they would have no sin when they do not exercise
   faith in Jesus; and the last passage announces the sinfulness of not
   believing, and ascribes the condemnation of all those who remain
   condemned to the fact, that they have not believed in the name of the
   only-begotten Son of God.

   Now what is the plain and obvious inference from these indisputable
   facts? If men cannot believe without the Spirit; and if they would not
   sin against God by not believing, if they really could not believe,
   shall we conclude, that all those from whom the Spirit is withheld are
   without sin when they do not believe? Such a conclusion as this would
   evidently be mistaken, because our Saviour plainly tells us, that so
   flagrant is the sin of unbelief, that it is announced as if it alone
   constituted the sole and the exclusive ground of condemnation. What,
   then, are we to make of these plain statements? Are we to attempt to
   explain them away altogether, or are we to arrive at the conclusion,
   that the Bible contradicts itself? Nay, verily. Let us rather admit,
   that no man is commanded to believe without the Spirit, and the entire
   mystery is solved. No man is required to believe without the Spirit,
   therefore no man is commanded to do what the Bible expressly declares
   no, man can do. If men could not believe, there would be no sin in
   their unbelief; but now we say they can believe, therefore their sin
   remaineth when they do not believe, and for their unbelief they are
   justly condemned.

   III. THE THIRD OBJECTION WHICH WE STATE AGAINST THIS DOCTRINE OF
   ELECTION IS, THAT IT DOES AWAY WITH THE NECESSITY OF THE INFLUENCE OF
   THE HOLY SPIRIT TO ENABLE MEN TO BELIEVE.

   The grave and heavy charge which I now adduce against this theory of
   election, I do not mean to substantiate by mere circumstantial evidence
   or inferential proof. Not that there would exist the slightest
   difficulty in doing this, so as to make out an unanswerable argument
   against it, but because, in the first instance at least, it is better
   at once to remove every shade of doubt or suspicion from your minds, as
   to the result of the important argument, which, under this head of
   discourse, we mean to pursue. We shall read to you the published
   declarations of our brethren themselves. We therefore solicit your
   attention to the following extracts.

   The first is from the second edition of a very able treatise, entitled,
   "The Work of the Holy Spirit in Conversion, by John Howard Hinton of
   London." In the ninth page of the advertisement prefixed to that very
   talented work, the author most candidly and honourably apprises his
   readers of the great point which he means to establish.

   "I have argued [says Mr. Hinton] that our being able to do anything is
   the same as our having sufficient means of doing it; that we have
   sufficient means of doing our whole duty without the Holy Spirit; and
   that, therefore, we are able to do our whole duty without him." P. 9.

   Such is this author's own statement of the main doctrine which his work
   was written and published to support. I shall append to this quotation
   a ingle specimen of the argument embodied in the book. The author is
   trying to prove his position from the Bible, and here is one of his
   proofs.

   "5. In this place, also, we may introduce the passage in which the
   apostle asserts the intrinsic and independent sufficiency of the divine
   word: From a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able
   to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ
   Jesus.' 2 Tim. iii. 15. We scarcely need stay to prove tthit the
   apostle here assigns to the Scriptures a sufficiency to make men wise
   unto salvation, apart from the influence of the Holy Spirit. No
   reference to the Spirit is contained in the passage or its connexion,
   nor is there any ground for introducing it. We observe more
   particularly, that the sufficiency of the Scriptures to impart saving
   wisdom is not to be viewed in the abstract, but in connexion with the
   persons to whom they are given: they are able to make US wise unto
   salvation. Now this, it is manifest, implies something respecting our
   condition as well as the excellency of the Scripture itself. It is not
   able to make an idiot or an infant or a dead man wise unto
   salvation--it can have this effect upon none but such as are capable of
   understanding, appreciating, and obeying it--whence it evidently
   follows that we, whom it is able to make wise unto salvation, are able
   to understand it, to appreciate and to obey." P. 134.

   These are the words of the writer who is looked up to by many as one
   champion of modern orthodoxy. The brethren whose sentiments are thus
   expressed and thus defended, are surely themselves denying the
   necessity of the Spirit's work in order to make men wise unto
   salvation. We are plainly and expressly informed, that any man, if he
   be not an idiot or an infant or a dead man, is perfectly able to become
   wise unto salvation, apart from the influence of the Holy Spirit. And
   yet these are the theologians who take the lead in charging upon us the
   denial of the work of the Spirit! We are informed, in the extract which
   we have just quoted to you, that the apostle says nothing at all about
   the Holy Spirit in the passage of Scripture on which the doctrine is
   founded; but we press the simple question, "Does the apostle say in
   that passage what our brethren say, when they tell us that the
   Scriptures are able to make us wise unto salvation apart from the
   influence of the Spirit of God"? We confidently submit, that the
   apostle propounds no such doctrine. He does not make mention of the
   Spirit--that is quite true. But if the apostle does not mention the
   Holy Spirit, he does not mean thereby to deny and to dishonour him by
   affirming, or even implying, that men may do very well without him in
   the matter of their salvation.

   Let this erroneous principle of interpretation be carried out, and the
   very reverse of the assertion may be easily proved. Our brethren say,
   that men may be saved without the Holy Spirit. Upon their principle of
   interpretation it would be easy to prove that men may be saved without
   the Word. Our Saviour said, for example, when he spoke to Nicodemus,
   "Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot see the
   kingdom of God." Now if any man has a right to take up the statement of
   Paul, wherein he asserts, that "the Holy Scriptures are able to make us
   wise unto salvation," and to argue therefrom that there is no need of
   the Spirit in order to enable men to be saved, may not another man take
   up the words of our Lord to Nicodemus, and argue therefrom, that there
   is no need of the Scriptures in order to lead men to salvation? There
   is no mention made of the Holy Spirit by Paul. That is true enough. But
   it is equally true that there is no mention made of the Scriptures by
   our Lord. And if it may be argued in the one case, that because the
   Scriptures only are expressly mentioned--therefore men may be saved
   without the Spirit--may it not be argued in the other case, that there
   is no need for the Bible at all, for men may be converted by water an[
   the Spirit, which alone are expressly mentioned by our Lord?

   The next quotation which I make is from the work of Dr. Wardlaw, from
   which, in former Lectures, I have freely quoted. The book from which I
   have already quoted, was written avowedly on the work of the Spirit;
   the book from which I am now to quote, was written avowedly for the
   purpose of proving the universal extent of the work of the Son; but in
   some parts of this book Dr. Wardlaw states his sentiments, and those of
   others who have adopted his theory of election, and these are precisely
   the sentiments of the author from whom I have last quoted.

   There exists in men universally [says Dr. W.] a ground of
   responsibility--all that is requisite, as before explained, to render
   them justly accountable. The accountableness for the treatment they
   give to the offers of the gospel arises from the nature of those offers
   themselves, as well as of human capabilities, irrespectively of all
   secret purposes in the mind of God, and of all communications of grace
   to the mind of man. All to whom the gospel message comes, and who have
   ears to hear,' have the means of salvation in their power; and it
   depends on their own will whether salvation is, or is not to be
   theirs."--Discourses, p. 180.

   The last sentence of this quotation announces a most delightful truth.
   One would imagine, at first sight, that there is implied in it, in the
   first place, the admission that there is no secret purpose
   unconditionally decreeing any man to inevitable destruction; and, in
   the second place, that the gracious influence of the Spirit, without
   which no man can come to Jesus, and whereby the Father draws us, is not
   withheld from any. But to our unspeakable astdnishment, we are here
   arrested by the information that such is by no means true. We refer you
   to the context, where we are reminded of the secret purpose and the
   special influence! We are told that the reason why it depends upon the
   will of men whether or not salvation may be theirs, arises from man's
   perfect capability to believe, in direct opposition to God's eternal
   purpose and the Holy Spirit's indispensable grace! To this doctrine we
   cannot subscribe. For what is this but to set up man's power--to
   exhibit what is styled man's "capabilities"--as something stronger than
   the decree of God! What is this but to assert that man wants only the
   will to prove himself more than a match for the overthrow of the
   counsels and decrees of the Almighty! What is this but to inform us
   that the sinner has no need whatever of any influence of the Spirit,
   but is perfectly competent to save himself even to the overthrow of the
   throne of the eternal God!

   I have now done what, in this discourse, I purposed to do. I have laid
   before you the proof, that I prefer no false or groundless charge
   against brethren, when I discard their theory of election, because it
   leads to a denial of the necessity of the Spirit's influence in order
   to enable sinners to believe.

   And now, my fellow-sinners, permit me again, in parting from you, to
   remind you, affectionately and solemnly, of the oath of your God. "As I
   live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn
   ye, from your evil ways, for why will ye die?" In parting from you
   again, I point you to that oath, and I ask you, Is God sincere and
   honest even when he swears? I point you to more than to his
   oath--behold the sacrifice of his Son I Sinner, behold the Lamb of God
   bearing away the sins of the world! Sinner, thy sins were all laid upon
   that innocent and spotless sacrifice! They are all away--away from
   between thee and thy God--away from between thee and the blessed
   influence of the Spirit, who, even now, is wooing every prodigal here
   back again to God! "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." Thus the
   Holy Spirit strives! But he will not strive for ever. Death, judgment,
   eternity--these are at the door, and if the Spirit part from you at
   death, he parts with you for ever.

LECTURE SEVENTH.

   THE NECESSITY OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO ENABLE MEN TO
   BELIEVE--SEMI-ORTHODOX PREACHING--QUOTATION FROM DR. WARDLAW--NATURAL
   AND MORAL INABILITY.

   JOHN iii. 5.--"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except
   a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
   kingdom of God."

   JOHN vi. 44.--"No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath
   sent me, draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day."

   HERE, then, are two Scripture witnesses, whose testimony we hesitate
   not to set in opposition to the two fallible witnesses whose report has
   been listened to in our previous discourse. The one witness declares
   that no man can come to Christ, or believe in him, without the drawing
   of the Father; the other witness declares that a sinner cannot see the
   kingdom of God, or be converted or born again, apart from the influence
   of the Spirit. These two statements of the Word of God are thus express
   and definite in their testimony in support of the absolute necessity of
   the Spirit to enable any man to believe.

   Now we crave your attention to the one single point which needs here to
   be examined. It is not denied by any man who supports the doctrine to
   which we now object, that the Spirit of God is needed to make the
   sinner willing to believe. And so, when we come to state such passages
   of Scripture in opposition to their doctrine, they explain away their
   import by affirming, that the only want experienced by men is a want of
   will. And so they would paraphrase the two Scripture proofs now under
   examination in the following way:--"No man will come to me, except the
   Father, who hath sent me, draw him," although any man and every man is
   quite able to believe in me without the drawing of the Father. And
   again, "Except a man be born of the Spirit, he will not see the kingdom
   of God," although any man has power enough to be born again, and to see
   the kingdom of God, and to enjoy its privileges without the Spirit!!!

   Here, then, is the single point which you will require to keep before
   your minds, in order that you may arrive at a just and intelligent
   decision. Does the inability of men to believe, or to be born again
   into the family of God, without the Spirit, amount to a mere want of
   will and nothing more? The question is not, whether the sinner is
   naturally unwilling to believe--that is not the question, for that is
   most fully admitted. But granting that be is unwilling, the question
   remains, Has he perfect power to believe and be saved without the
   influence of the Spirit, so that he is able to become wise unto
   salvation, without any interposition on the part of the third person of
   the Godhead? Now, in answer to this question, we request you to
   observe, and to remember well, the distinct assertions of the Word of
   God to which we have referred you; and we ask you, without any
   prejudice in your minds, to decide as to their plain and common-sense
   import. When you read the words, "No man can come to me except the
   Father draw him," do you suppose, as honest and unprejudiced men and
   women, that you are at liberty to interpret these words so as to infer
   that any man is perfectly able to come to Jesus without the drawing of
   the Father? Would not such an interpretation amount to a contradiction
   of our Saviour's statement? And when you read the words, "Except a man
   be born of the Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God," would any of
   you think of saying, that you were bringing out the meaning of the
   solemn and emphatic declaration, by asserting that any man is perfectly
   able to see the kingdom of God without the Spirit? Yet such is the
   interpretation which is put upon such statements!! It is affirmed that
   such passages of Scripture do not assert a want of power on the part of
   the sinner to do well enough without the Spirit, but that they refer,
   simply and exclusively, to a want of will to exercise his powers in the
   right and proper direction. And we are referred to the obvious fact,
   that the Holy Spirit, in conversion, does not impart to the sinner any
   new faculties or powers of mind, and brethren erroneously conclude,
   that because the sinner does not get a set of new faculties or powers
   when he is converted, that therefore he is able to convert himself
   without the Spirit!!

   The error to which we now advert arises from an oversight of the fact,
   that the reason why every man is able to believe is, that every man is,
   in point of fact, drawn by God with the view of bringing him to the
   acceptance of a full and free salvation. But suppose that any sinner
   were not drawn by God, we submit that it would be impossible for him
   (even though he were willing) to believe in Jesus. We submit that,
   while every man is able to come with the drawing, and in consequence of
   the drawing, of the Father, no man is able to come, or could possibly
   be able to come without this drawing influence; and we hold that, when
   any man resolves this want of ability to be saved without the Spirit
   into a mere want of will, he is perverting and setting aside the
   infallible statements of the infallible Word.

   We may here illustrate our doctrine by a parallel case. Take the
   supposition of a mighty prince, in a remote province of whose dominions
   the standard of rebellion has been erected, but who has resolved, in
   virtue of a satisfaction given to his government, to proclaim, in
   person, a free pardon to every one of his rebel subjects. You must
   suppose that the minds of the rebels are filled with hard and
   suspicious thoughts respecting their lawful sovereign. They know his
   power, but they are impressed with the idea that he is desirous only to
   exercise his power in oppressing and punishing them for their
   rebellion. He might send forth an ambassador to proclaim a pardon to
   the rebels and to invite them back again to their allegiance. But he
   takes a different plan. He leaves his splendid palace; he goes forth
   himself with his own proclamation, and he himself announces it in
   person to the rebels; he goes in person from city to city, and from
   town to town, and from village to village, and from house to house; he
   announces, with his own lips, to every one of his rebel subjects the
   wonderful intelligence, that his own son--the heir of his kingdom and
   his throne--has voluntarily subjected himself to punishment in their
   room and stead; he announces to them the farther intelligence, that so
   desirous was he himself for their happiness, that he accepted of the
   substitution, of his son and heir in their stead, for the very purpose
   of enabling him consistently to offer them a free pardon, and save them
   from the punishment which their revolt had justly merited; he entreats
   and beseeches and implores the rebels, on his bended knees, to lay down
   their arms and submit to his government, and not to compel him, most
   reluctantly, to execute summary vengeance upon them, by persisting any
   longer in their rebellion! The result of all this personal entreaty is,
   that some of the rebels become subdued in their enmity by the wondrous
   condescension of the sovereign, and submit themselves to his sway,
   while the rest of them will not believe him, nor give him credit for
   his generosity and kindness, and therefore remain rebels, and are
   consequently treated as enemies, simply because they refuse to he
   reconciled.

   In this case you will perceive, that the only reason why any one of
   these rebel subjects are not saved from the consequences of their
   revolt, is, that they will not believe and trust the kindness of their
   sovereign, and refuse, consequently, to be at peace with him. It would
   be absurd to say that on such a supposition they could not believe. It
   was simply because they would not, and not because they could not. The
   self-same influence which was brought to bear upon those rebels who
   were induced to accept the pardon of their prince, was brought to bear
   upon those who obstinately persisted in their revolt, shutting their
   ears against the entreaties, and their eyes against the manifested
   kindness of their most gracious sovereign. The only difference between
   the two classes of individuals consisted in this--the one yielded to
   the drawing influence of their sovereign's compassionate efforts, the
   other resisted the same drawing influence which was exerted equally
   upon them, with the view of winning them back to their allegiance.

   But if you alter the supposition, and imagine to yourselves the
   sovereign of whom we have spoken, selecting from among these rebel
   subjects a few special favourites, and passing by all the rest, and
   condescending to visit in person only those houses or cities that
   happen to be inhabited by the favoured few--you entirely change the
   whole aspect of the case. You thereby render it absolutely impossible
   for the rebels who are passed by to believe in the gracious intentions
   of their sovereign--to accept his pardon, and to become reconciled to
   his person and his government. In the case already supposed, it was
   possible for them to be reconciled, and it was sinful for them to
   remain in a position of hostility, because the drawing influence of
   their sovereign's kindness was exerted equally upon them all. They had
   all of them evidence sufficient to convince them, and motive sufficient
   to induce them, to lay down their arms and be at peace. But in the case
   now supposed, they want the evidence necessary to convince them, and
   the motive necessary to induce them, and it is not because they have
   not the use of all their powers or faculties, but because they cannot
   possibly exercise their powers in the way of believing, without any
   evidence, or changing their minds without any motive, that it is
   utterly impossible for them to accept the pardon which the sovereign
   most graciously proclaims. In this case, what does the sovereign do? He
   passes them by--he does not condescend to speak to them--he does not
   deign to notice them. He knocks at the door of their neighbour's
   house--he repairs to the gate of the adjoining city--and he pleads with
   his favourites, and his favourites alone. The rebels who are passed by
   do not, of course, believe that there is any pardon for them. They do
   not believe that their sovereign desires them to be at peace with him.
   They believe, on the other hand, that all that the man wants is, to get
   his pampered favourites induced to flee with him out of the scene of
   revolt, and that his determination is only the more unalterably fixed
   to take summary vengeance on all the rest, and in due time visit them,
   if he can, with fire and sword. They do not believe in his love to
   theme and they are not reconciled. Now, the question which I propose to
   you is this--Whether is it because the men will not believe, or because
   they cannot believe, in the love of their sovereign to them that they
   remain rebels? Mark well the true position of affairs. The king passes
   by their door. He does not pass them by because he has no time to visit
   them. He does not pass them by because he falls into the mistake of
   ignorance, and does not know that their houses are inhabited. He came
   to the rebel province with an unalterable determination not to speak to
   them at all. Nay more, he knew that he needed only to pass them by in
   order to confirm and harden them in their rebellion; and because he
   determined to destroy them, he passed them by. This is what the men are
   told. This is what they are taught to believe. I ask any man of common
   sense to tell me, if, in this case, it be possible for the men to
   believe in the pardoning mercy of their prince, and to be reconciled?
   The visit of the king to his special favourites, is not, in this case,
   fitted to draw the rest; it is fitted to repel them. This special
   influence put forth upon some, it is evident, is not a drawing, but a
   repelling influence to all the rest. They cannot--it is not that they
   will not, but it is an absolute impossibility for them to believe in
   their sovereign's love, because the sovereign does not seek to draw
   them.

   The preachers of our day who hold the theory now under examination,
   preach a gospel to all men; but they tell all men, at the same time,
   that God has unalterably determined that all from whom the special
   influence is withheld are doomed by God to unconditional damnation.
   Here, then, is the evidence--the only evidence which is presented
   before perishing thousands, Sabbath after Sabbath, and year after year.
   The question is very simple. Is it possible for any man to believe in
   the face of this evidence in the love of God to his soul, before he is
   quite sure that the special influence has visited him? It is perfectly
   plain, on their own principles, that until a man not only has the
   supposed special influence, but knows infallibly that he has it, the
   man would be believing in opposition to the plainest evidence, if he
   ventured to believe in the pardoning mercy of God as bringing to him a
   free salvation. But it is not possible for any man to believe in
   opposition to apprehended proof. It is not possible for a man, for
   example, to believe that it is midnight in the midst of the clearly
   perceived light of the meridian sun. If any man, therefore, believe
   that all are doomed to damnation who have not the thing which men call
   a special influence, he cannot, in the absence of that supposed
   influence from his soul, believe that salvation has come to him. It is,
   therefore, not only unscriptural, but absurd, in the supporters of a
   special influence, to maintain that any sinner is able to believe and
   to do all his duty without the Holy Spirit.

   I am about to exhibit a specimen of such semi-orthodox preaching, from
   the "Discourses on the Nature and Extent of the Atonement," by Dr.
   Wardlaw of Glasgow.

   I may only premise, that it lacks but one element--the recognition of
   the necessity of the Holy Spirit's indispensable influence. This will
   appear very clearly at the close of this quotation.

   "If there were a want of natural capacity for believing, there would be
   equally a want of natural capacity for disbelieving. If there were not
   this kind of ability to believe, there would be no guilt in
   unbelief.--O my fellow-sinners, deceive not yourselves, as multitudes
   have done before you, with this plea of inability. The plea is often
   advanced with a levity of spirit, that sufficiently indicates its
   origin. We cannot, it seems, help ourselves,'--many have thought and
   said,--we have no ability to do anything; we cannot change our own
   hearts; we cannot atone for our sins; we cannot come to God; we cannot
   believe;--it is divine power, divine grace, that must do the work;--it
   is not ours;--and if God is not pleased to put forth the necessary
   power,--what can we do?--There is no help for us:--we must be
   damned!'--And with the last fearful link of the chain there is secretly
   associated a self-flattering hope,--a hope founded in the
   unreasonableness and unrighteousness of such a doom,--that it shall not
   be so. This, I apprehend, is uniformly involved in the real or affected
   carelessness with which the conclusion,--a conclusion in itself so
   unspeakably fearful,--is usually uttered. The mind rests its hope
   secretly on the unfairness that inability should incur condemnation.
   The inward surmise is:--if we really are unable, then every effort of
   ours must be unavailing; perdition is entailed upon us, and by nothing
   that we can do is it avoidable:--and yet--and yet--is this
   justice?--and--if it be not justice, can it be true?'

   "Now, my fellow-sinners, this is all delusion. I come to the point at
   once; and, with all diffidence, yet with all confidence, I say to
   you,--if there were no ability, it would not be justice. But in the
   sense in which you urge the plea, and in which, perhaps, it has been
   put into your lips, there is no truth in it. In the sense in which you
   plead inability,--the only sense in which the plea could be of any
   avail,--you are not unable. So far from being unable in any sense that
   even palliates your unbelief and impenitence,--your inability, rightly
   interpreted, resolves itself into the strongest mode of expressing your
   culpability and guilt. For what does the word mean?--simply, the
   strength of your antipathy to God and to goodness. Your inability to
   believe is only another phrase for your aversion to the truth of God.
   Your inability to repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for
   repentance,' what else is it, less or more, than your fondness for the
   service of sin and of the world, and your unwillingness to relinquish
   it?--what is it, but that you cannot give up the world;--you cannot
   renounce your favourite sins;--you cannot abandon 'the lust of the
   flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life;' or you cannot bear
   the mortification of pride, the renunciation of your own righteousness,
   the crucifixion of self?--What is there in your cannot, but the want of
   will?--If you tell me you are willing but not able, you tell me what
   never has been, and never can be; what involves, indeed, a fiat and
   palpable contradiction; inasmuch as, the inability affirmed in
   Scripture being unwillingness, and nothing else whatever, it amounts to
   neither more nor less than saying that you are willing and unwilling at
   the same time. To say you would believe if you could,--is not only not
   true; it is the precise opposite of truth. The plain truth is, that you
   could believe if you would; there being no one thing whatever that
   prevents you from believing, but the want of will; nothing between you
   and pardon but the want of will to have it in God's way,--that is,
   freely, and in connexion with holiness, with newness of life.--I would
   but can't believe,'--I would but can't repent,'--are, both of them, as
   unsound philosophy as they are unsound divinity. If in any instance
   either were true, there would, in that instance, be no guilt in
   unbelief and impenitence. It is the will that is wanting, and the will
   only. The will to believe is, virtually, faith; the will to repent is,
   virtually, penitence. There never has been the will to either, where
   there have not actually been both.

   "In making the atonement, and in offering you pardon on account of it,
   if you are willing to accept the pardon on that ground, God has put the
   blessing in your power. Who is to blame, if you have it not? Not He
   assuredly; but yourselves, and yourselves alone.--What would you have?
   You have all the natural faculties and powers, that are necessary to
   constitute a ground of accountableness. You have the natural powers
   required for considering, understanding, believing, choosing, loving
   and hating, speaking and acting;--and moreover for asking. The
   question, then, is, How comes it that these powers are not occupied
   about proper objects?--how comes it that they are not rightly
   directed?--Take them in order. You have the power of considering:--why
   is it that you do not consider the 'things that belong to your
   everlasting peace,'--the things which, of all others, you cannot but be
   sensible, ought, both in duty and in interest, to be considered by
   you?--You have the power of understanding!--how is it, that you do not
   understand the divine testimony;--that is, that you do not perceive and
   appreciate its excellence, and its adaptation both to God's character
   and to man's need? Why, even of yourselves, judge ye not that which is
   right?'--You have the power of believing,--of crediting what is
   attested by sufficient evidence. You are practising this every day and
   every hour, on other subjects. How is it, that you do not believe the
   Word of God,--the glorious gospel,--the word of reconciliation,' of
   peace with God through the atoning blood of the cross? Is it because
   you have examined its evidence, and satisfactorily proved it untrue? or
   is it because, in its humbling and holy character, it is not to your
   liking? Let conscience give a faithful answer. You have the power of
   choosing:--you are exercising it continually. How is it, that you do
   not, among the objects presented for your selection, choose the good
   part that shall never be taken from you?' You have the natural power of
   loving, and of hating:--how is it, that you do not love God, love
   Christ, love holiness?--and how is it, that you do not hate sin, and
   abhor that which is evil'?--how is it that your love and your hatred
   are not in harmony with those of God, that you do not hate what he
   hates, and love what he loves? You have the natural power of speaking
   and acting;--why is it, that you do not always speak and act aright? I
   have added to all these--You have the power of asking;--yes; and with
   the power, you have the liberty, in the quarter where most it behoves
   you to apply; and more even than liberty--earnest invitation, and all
   the encouragement of faithful promise:--how is it, then, that you do
   not ask of God?--how is it that you come not to him for the influences
   of his Spirit, and for the blessings of his salvation? how is it, that,
   when these blessings are set before you, on the ground of the
   atonement, in all their fulness and in all their freeness, you do not
   eagerly and gratefully accept them?--that when the way is opened to the
   mercy-seat, through the rending of the vail even the Redeemer's flesh,
   you do not press towards it?--that when in Christ's reconciling the
   world unto himself,' he beseeches you to be reconciled to him, you do
   not catch with all avidity at the gracious entreaty, and come into
   friendship with your justly offended God?--O delude not your own souls
   by talking of inability. Is there any other answer that can truly, in
   the tribunal of conscience, be given to such questions, but one--that
   you have no heart' to these things--to the truths, to the ways, to the
   service, or to the enjoyment of God? And if this aversion of heart,
   this perverseness of disposition, this want of will to that which is
   good, be not sinful, then is there no such thing as sin in the
   universe--no moral evil or criminal desert--nothing on account of which
   any creature can be condemned or punished.

   "I again ask, what would you have? Every consideration that is
   calculated to influence and determine the choice of your mind, is set
   before you;--everything fearful on the one side, everything truly
   desirable on the other. The terrors of coming wrath are depicted, to
   induce you to flee from them, and effect a timely escape; and the way
   of escape is set open before you. All that is, or ought to be,
   attractive, in the beauties of holiness,--in the prospect of fulness of
   joy and pleasures for evermore,'--in a God who 'delighteth in mercy,'
   and whose very nature is love,'--in a Saviour as willing as he is able,
   and as able as he is willing, to 'save you to the utternmost,'--in an
   atonement whose infinite virtue is for all,--in the forgiveness of sin,
   fellowship with God, and the reciprocations of mutual love between the
   renewed soul and the divine source of all blessing;--in all that is
   comprehended in life eternal!--What would you have? The most sincere
   and earnest invitations are addressed to you, assuring you of the
   divine readiness to receive and to bless you: and every one of these
   invitations proceeds upon the assumption, that there is nothing between
   you and the enjoyment of the blessings to which you are invited, but
   your own will. Jehovah--the God with whom it is impossible to lie,
   swears to you by the certainty and necessity of his own being--As I
   live, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that
   the wicked turn from his wicked way, and live: turn ye, turn ye, for
   why will ye die?' and Jesus, the divine Saviour, pleads with, and
   entreats, and encourages you--Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
   heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.'--What would you have? What more
   is necessary to constitute a valid ground of
   responsibility?--think,--and say,--what more is there required?--what
   is wanting?--There is nothing remaining, that I can conceive of, but
   your being made willing. Will you say that this is necessary to your
   accountableness? If you wish to retain your claim to rationality, you
   will never advance such a plea. Think a moment--a moment will be
   enough--of its self-contradictory absurdity: that it should be
   necessary for you to be made willing, in order to your becoming
   accountable for being unwilling!--that a right disposition requires to
   be imparted, in order to your being responsible for cherishing and
   indulging a wrong one! And yet, gross as is the absurdity of the
   sentiment, it is greatly to be feared that some impious surmise of this
   kind floats in many minds--that unless God give them a right
   disposition, they cannot help it. But the entire Bible proceeds on the
   assumption that the wrong disposition is your sin,--existing and
   operating wilfully, resisting the inducements to its suppression and
   crucifixion, and neither desiring nor seeking divine aid to effect
   it.--What would you have? You are neither compelled to evil, nor
   forcibly restrained from good. You voluntarily choose the one; you
   voluntarily refuse the other. It is a matter of consciously spontaneous
   preference. What, then, I still urge upon you, would you have? You
   cannot be saved against your will. You cannot have your hearts changed
   against your will. You cannot be made willing against your will! You
   have all the powers before enumerated: you have all conceivable motives
   presented to you to exercise those powers aright--in the choice, the
   love, the pursuit, and the enjoyment of right and worthy objects: you
   are under no compulsory and no withholding power. Why, then, I repeat,
   do you remain at a distance from God, when he invites you to his
   presence and his favour? Why are you not interested in the virtue of
   the atonement, when you are assured that its virtue is free to you and
   to all Why are you not partakers of the blessings of God's salvation,
   when these, in all the free munificence of the Godhead, are set before
   you, and pressed upon your acceptance? Why are you not in the way to
   heaven, when the gate is thrown wide, and entrance not permitted merely
   but urged? Who, let me ask, or what, prevents you? WHO? Not God: he
   invites, entreats, prays you, and, with the sceptre of his grace
   extended, waits for you, that you may touch it, and live. Not Christ.
   He has shed his blood for sinners, and for you among the rest,--he sets
   himself before you, crucified and slain--he shows you his hands and his
   side, and says, Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.'
   WHAT, then, prevents you? Nothing whatever, in the form of obstacle,
   lies in your way, save those which are thrown there by the devil, the
   world, and the flesh, operating upon your earthly and corrupt
   affections, and indisposing you to leave the broad way and enter the
   narrow; that is, there is nothing but the strong antagonist power of
   your inclination to sense and sin. The sole obstacle is to be found in
   the words--Ye will not.' Do not delude yourselves by fancying there is
   anything else. Cheat not your souls with words. Believe not those who
   would lay your consciences to sleep on the pillow of an imaginary
   inability. Unwillingness is the word. It is the inability of
   disinclination--of alienation of heart; moral inability. You can, but
   will not, is the truth; or, if you like it better, though it is the
   same thing, you cannot, because you will not."--Pp. 146-155.

   I have now done with the reading of the quotation, and I have one
   question to propose--Do you not perceive the important, the studied
   omission? The excellent author, from whose discourses we have read, is
   true to his system. But what has become of the special influence, for
   which he contends so zealously, and which he believes to be the saving
   influence of the Holy Spirit? What has he made of this? Is there any
   reference to its necessity, or--to the necessity of the Spirit of God
   in any form, or in any degree whatever, in order to the conversion of
   the sinner to God? It is painful, indeed, to differ on a point so very
   important from such a writer as this. But is it possible to agree, even
   with this revered servant of Jesus Christ, without committing ourselves
   to a denial of the necessity of Divine influence in order to the
   production of saving faith? He asks--"Who or what prevents you?" And
   mark his reply--"Not God: he invites, entreats, prays you; and, with
   the sceptre of his grace extended, waits for you, that you may touch
   it, and live. Not Christ. He has shed his blood for sinners, and for
   you among the rest--he sets himself before you, crucified and slain--he
   shows you his hands and his side, and says, Him that cometh unto me, I
   will in no wise cast out.' What, then, prevents you?" Our answer to
   this question is, "The Holy Spirit's blessed influence is awanting
   still." Is it possible that this writer could pen and preach the
   beautiful and striking appeal to sinners which we have quoted, and not
   think of this most important omission? Would that Dr. Wardlaw had added
   one single sentence more, just before asking the sinner, "What, then,
   prevents you?" Would that he had written down such a sentence as
   this--"Not the Holy Spirit: for thus it is written, To-day, as the Holy
   Ghost saith, to-day, Oh that ye would hear his voice, and harden not
   your hearts.' And again, The Spirit, as well as the Bride, says Come.'
   And, yet once more, every moment you remain unconverted, Ye do always
   resist the Holy Ghost.'" Would Dr. Wardlaw have compromised his system,
   had he appended such a sentence as this? Doubtless he would, and he
   knew it. But does not this only prove, even to a demonstration, that
   this system lacks "one thing needful" to be consistent with the Word of
   God--the recognition of the absolute necessity of the influence of the
   Spirit, in order to enable any sinner to believe in Christ, and to be
   saved? We pause for a reply.

   We shall doubtless be referred to the distinction between natural and
   moral inability--a distinction which our brethren are in the habit of
   drawing with the view of evading the difficulty in which they are
   placed by their theory, and escaping the consequences to which it
   inevitably leads. Justice, therefore, to our subject, requires us to
   examine this point, before dismissing this part of our argument.

   What do brethren understand by moral and what by natural ability? The
   former implies the possession of the power or ability to will. The
   latter implies the possession of the power to act. It is admitted on
   all hands that the action is dependent upon the will. So dependent is
   the action upon the will, and so closely connected are they with each
   other, that, in the passage now quoted, Dr. Wardlaw says, that "the
   will to believe is virtually faith; the will to repent is virtually
   penitence. There never has been the will to either, where there have
   not actually been both." This is a very strong assertion of what is
   called man's natural ability to believe unto salvation. But while it is
   asserted that wherever there is the will to believe, faith is the
   invariable result, it is evidently, indeed necessarily, implied that
   faith cannot exist where the will to believe is awanting. Where the
   will exists, faith is said invariably to follow. But where the will is
   awanting faith will be admitted, as a matter of course, to be
   impossible. "You could believe if you would," Dr. Wardlaw says. But it
   is no less true that you cannot believe, if you will not. The second
   statement is no less true than the first. They stand or fall together.
   But it is affirmed that men have not the power to will. This is
   affirmed by our brethren who have unanswerably demonstrated, and who
   glory in admitting, that men have the power to believe. Let us inquire,
   therefore, into the reason of their strong assertion of man's power to
   believe. We take the statement of the excellent author from whom we
   have so largely quoted. He says truly--"if there were no ability it
   would not be justice" to condemn any sinner on the ground of unbelief.
   Here, then, is one strong position which we occupy in asserting man's
   perfect ability savingly to believe. The responsibility of the sinner
   is measured by his opportunity or his power. But the question
   arises--is the sinner not responsible for his determinations or
   volitions? Is he not responsible for the man. ner in which he exercises
   his will? Listen again to Dr. Wardlaw's reply to this question--"If
   this aversion of heart--this perverseness of disposition--this want of
   will to that which is good, be not sinful, then is there no such thing
   as sin in the universe--no moral evil or criminal desert--nothing, on
   account of which any creature can be condemned or punished." Here again
   we have the happiness of saying amen to the doctrine of Dr. Wardlaw. It
   is sinful--justly punishable--not to will in accordance with the will
   of God. Now comes our inquiry--why is the sinner justly punishable for
   not willing to believe? Will Dr. Wardlaw here withdraw his words--"If
   there were no ability it would not be justice"? Surely not. The
   assertion is just, and it is true that the measure of a man's ability
   is the measure of his responsibility. But every man is responsible for
   the direction in which he wills. On Dr. Wardlaw's own principle,
   therefore, the sinner must possess the power--the ability to will. It
   is upon the admission of this truth, and that alone, that our brethren
   can maintain their consistency. They cannot surely argue that it would
   be unjust in God to condemn the sinner who has no power to believe,
   because the man believes not; and at the same time affirm that it is
   perfectly just in God to condemn the sinner who has no power to will
   because he wills not! If the want of power be the measure of just
   responsibility in the one case--it is the same in the other case. And
   therefore we submit with all deference to the venerated man from whom
   we have quoted, that the same principle whereby he establishes man's
   natural ability to believe, proves beyond all reasonable question, that
   the sinner possesses the power or the ability to will, as well as the
   power or ability to do, consistently with the just and righteous
   command of God.

   You must have noticed that, in the quotation already made, even Dr.
   Wardlaw expresses himself upon this point with evident inconsistency.
   He speaks, in the first place, as if any man in his senses ever dreamt
   of maintaining the absurdity that a sinner must be willing before he
   can be responsible for being unwilling! Did the doctor ever listen to
   the assertion of an absurdity such as this beyond the precincts of an
   asylum? Nay, verily. He accordingly says very truly, "If you wish to
   retain your claim to rationality, you will never advance such a plea.
   Think a moment--a moment will be enough--of its self-contradictory
   absurdity: that it should be necessary for you to be made willing in
   order to your becoming accountable for being unwilling!" The doctor is
   verily right in affirming that no sane man could possibly advance such
   a plea. "And yet, gross as is the absurdity of the sentiment, it is
   greatly to be feared [adds this writer] that some impious surmise of
   this kind floats in many minds--that unless God give them a right
   disposition, they cannot help it." Is it possible that Dr. Wardlaw
   could purposely set himself to practise a deception upon the minds of
   his readers? It is impossible. It is therefore very evident that the
   doctor is himself labouring under a gross misconception, when he
   confounds the act of willing with the power to will. It is absurd,
   indeed, to imagine, even for a moment, that the actual existence of the
   former is essential to responsibility; but it is not absurd to affirm
   that a man is not, and cannot be, justly held responsible, if the
   latter be indeed awanting. But any ignorant and unthinking individual
   who should happen to peruse or listen to the eloquent appeal of this
   writer, would imagine, and would be warranted to infer from the
   expressions we have quoted, that the doctor's opponents must be
   irrational indeed! No man could imagine for a moment that the doctor is
   capable of, descending to an intentional misrepresentation; and few men
   have been accustomed to observe the egregious blunders into which even
   great and learned men constantly fall, when they are warped and
   entangled by an absurd and erroneous system of theology. And knowing
   that Dr. Wardlaw is morally incapable of misrepresentation, and
   fancying, moreover, that HE is intellectually incapable of falling into
   a very ridiculous mistake--most of his readers will doubtless imagine
   that the system which he aims at in the expressions now under
   consideration, actually proceeds upon the absurd conception, that the
   sinner must be "made willing" before he can be responsible for being
   unwilling! The followers of Dr. Wardlaw would be surprised, indeed, if
   Dr. Candlish or Dr. Marshall, or any of the extreme men of Calvin,
   should try to argue against Dr. Wardlaw's strong assertion of every
   sinner's ability to believe, so that, "if there were no ability it
   would not be justice" to condemn him for unbelief, in the same style as
   Dr. Wardlaw has attempted to argue against the sinner's ability to
   will. What if Dr. Wardlaw should be met by the following statements in
   the form of a refutation:--"If you, Dr. Ralph Wardlaw, wish to retain
   your claim to rationality, you will never advance such a plea. Think a
   moment--a moment will be enough--of its self-contradictory absurdity:
   that it should be necessary for you to be made to believe, in order to
   your becoming accountable for your unbelief! And yet, gross as is the
   absurdity of the sentiment, it is evident from your book that some
   impious surmise of this kind floats in your mind--that unless God
   constrain you to believe, it would not be justice to condemn you."
   Would Dr. Wardlaw or his followers in his own Union, and also in the
   United Presbyterian Church, be satisfied with such a representation of
   their own sentiments? Would they not be very ready to detect the
   fallacy and cry out against the injustice? Would they not exclaim--"We
   never said that the sinner needed to be made to believe, but that the
   sinner must possess the power to believe before he can be justly
   punished for his unbelief; and you, Doctors Candlish and Marshall,
   confound the act of believing with the power to believe, and you thus
   misrepresent our doctrine when you try to fasten upon it such an
   absurdity"?--Would not this be Dr. Wardlaw's reply to such an argument
   against his own doctrine--"that a man is not responsible for not
   believing who wants the power to believe"? Such, then, is our reply to
   his argument against our doctrine, when we maintain "that a man is not
   responsible for being unwilling who wants the power to will."

   The ground occupied by Dr. Wardlaw, when he affirms that God cannot
   justly condemn any sinner for unbelief who has not the power to
   believe, is the exact foundation on which any man may take his stand
   and maintain the injustice of condemning any sinner for not willing to
   believe who wants the power to will. It is not the want of faith which
   would render it unjust in God to punish, but the want of power to
   exercise faith. How absurd to imagine that a man must have faith before
   he can be justly punished for the want of it! But does Dr. Wardlaw
   entertain such an absurd notion as this? He does, if his argument be
   worth anything, when he exclaims, "How absurd to imagine that a man
   must have the will to believe before he can be justly punished for the
   want of will!" Both absurdities are equally absurd. But if the last is
   necessarily implied in the doctrine, that the power to will is
   necessary to responsibility for unwillingness, the first is equally
   implied in the doctrine, that the power to believe is necessary to
   responsibility for unbelief. But Dr. Wardlaw does not entertain such an
   absurdity as that a man must believe in order to be justly punished for
   not believing! His argument, therefore, is not worth a straw against us
   when he speaks of "the self-contradictory absurdity--that it should be
   necessary for you to be made willing in order to your becoming
   accountable for being unwilling!" The doctor has evidently been aiming
   at some system which has no "claim to rationality," when he penned the
   sentences we have been examining. But we humbly submit, that the
   implied charge falls back upon his own theory. It is surely most
   irrational to affirm, that the want of power to discharge one
   obligation releases the sinner from just responsibility, while it is,
   at the same time, maintained, that the same want of power to discharge
   another obligation leaves the man accountable for its neglect. But the
   theory now under examination admits the injustice of punishing a man
   for not believing aright if the man wants the power to believe, while
   it affirms that there is no injustice whatever in punishing a man for
   not willing aright if the man wants the power to will!! Is not this
   inconsistent and irrational?

   But no stronger reasoning can be advanced in favour of the vaunted
   distinction between natural and moral ability and inability. It is a
   distinction without a difference, and no solid argument can be based
   upon it. The self-same argument which establishes what is called man's
   natural ability, or power to believe and to do his duty, demonstrates
   man's moral ability or power to will, to believe, and to do his duty.
   And the same weapon whereby the one should be overthrown would destroy
   both, and that, too, at the same stroke.

   Any man who peruses the long extract which we have quoted from Dr.
   Wardlaw might be led to inquire, whether the doctor seriously believes
   the theory which he has set himself to maintain. Does the doctor not
   assure the sinner, that he has the power not only of considering,
   understanding, believing, but also of "choosing"? To this we say, amen.
   But what says the system which is based upon the imaginary distinction
   between natural and moral ability--the system which affirms that man
   has no power of choice? Have I not quoted the doctor's express words,
   when I have written down the following--"What would you have? You are
   neither compelled to evil, nor forcibly restrained from good. You
   voluntarily choose the one; you voluntarily refuse the other. It is a
   matter of consciously spontaneous preference. What then, I still urge
   upon you, would you have? You cannot be saved against your will. You
   cannot have your hearts changed against your will! You cannot be made
   willing against your will! You have all the powers before enumerated."
   And now we again ask, Has not Dr. Wardlaw himself expressly mentioned,
   among the number of man's natural powers, the power of choice? And what
   is the power to choose but the power to determine or to will in one
   direction rather than in any other? And has not the doctor appealed to
   every man's consciousness in support of this great truth? And if, in
   support of this great truth, every man's consciousness decides, what
   have we but an infallible decision against the system which affirms the
   want of the power to will or to choose in the absence of a special
   influence for which this writer has been wont to contend?

   When it is demanded of us now, "What, then, would you have?" we think
   we are fully warranted to reply, "We would have the honest consistency
   of truthful and truth-loving men." We would have anything rather than a
   system of shuffling and shifting and popularity-hunting expediency. We
   would have a consistent advocacy of the glorious and soul-saving truth
   by brethren who have much to answer for at the judgment-seat of God,
   seeing that to whomsoever much talent and much influence is given, of
   them much shall be required. We would have the esteemed and eloquent
   writer from whom we have quoted, and our very esteemed friends of the
   United Presbyterian Church, to lead forward and advance the mighty
   movement which has been begun in our land, instead of frowning upon it
   and retarding it, and doing all in their power to crush and annihilate
   it. Or, if we cannot have this, we would have the opposite consistent
   alternative. Let them stand by Dr. Marshall and his party. Let us have
   the consistency of error rather than this truckling and halting
   expediency, and we shall know how to deal with it. But when we have at
   one time, and in one sentence, the confession of the truth, and, in the
   very next sentence or discourse, the exhibition of opposing error; when
   now we have Jesus Christ, and, in a short time, John Calvin, exhibited
   as an authority; when we have, in one page, the assertion that man has
   no power to will without the special, indefinable, irresistible
   influence of an ideal theology, and, in another page, the affirmation
   of man's perfect power to will as well as to believe, without the Holy
   Spirit at all; when we have the one or the other--error or truth, truth
   or error, or truth and error, both together, jumbled and hashed up in
   one heterogeneous mass, precisely as expediency may direct;--when we
   have such a state of things round about us, we are almost confounded by
   the question, which is again and again pressed upon our notice,--"What
   would you have?"

   But the plea which is founded upon the distinction between natural and
   moral inability, is evidently unsound and untenable, not only for the
   reason already stated, but for another reason, with the statement of
   which we shall now conclude this discourse. It is admitted that men
   cannot be saved against their will, or have their hearts changed
   against their will, or consider, or ask, or perform one single duty
   against their will; and yet they are informed by these sapient
   teachers, that they have the power to believe and to be saved, while
   they are at the same time warned not to believe "the heresy" which
   assures them that they possess the power to will! Without their will,
   they are not able to believe or to do their duty, but they are quite
   able to believe and to do their whole duty, although they have no power
   or command over their will! Is not this a palpable absurdity? How can
   sinners be possessed of natural ability, or the power to act aright, if
   they have no power to will aright, when the doing is admittedly
   dependent upon the previous willing? How is it possible for any man to
   take the second step, when it is not possible for him so much as to
   attempt the first step, it being admitted that the former is
   necessarily dependent upon the latter? Does not this absurd philosophy
   mar the beauty, and take the heart and soul out of the glorious gospel,
   with which it has been unnaturally linked? What is the gospel which our
   brethren present, Sabbath after Sabbath, before their congregations? It
   is the mere dead carcase of Christianity. It is Christianity divested
   of its energy and its power. It is the merest mockery of human
   wretchedness. Is this an uncharitable announcement? Look at it and
   judge for yourselves. We look them once more in the face, and ask our
   brethren--Do you not say to the sinner that he is perfectly able to
   believe and to be saved? Do you not tell him that it would be unjust in
   God to condemn him, if he had not the power savingly to believe? Do you
   not assure him that he possesses "all the powers required for
   considering, understanding, believing, choosing, [?] loving and hating,
   speaking and acting; and, moreover, for asking"? But when the sinner
   comes to be wrought upon by such statements as these, so as to find
   himself most uneasy in the midst of his remaining unbelief, and would
   instantly flee to Jesus for safety, what do you not say to him?--in
   what way do you set the man's conscience at rest for time, and leave
   him waiting and waiting and waiting, under the conviction that it is
   his duty to wait on, without the possession of perfect and solid peace
   with God? You inform him that he wants the power to will to believe!
   You tell him, that when you spoke of ability, it was not moral, but
   only natural ability to which you referred; and by your misty
   metaphysical distinction, you cloud and obscure the poor man's
   soul--you hide from his eye the sun of righteousness, by this
   metaphysical mist which you throw around the sphere of his mental
   vision! To what does this vaunted distinction, after all, amount? Like
   every other distinction got up for the purpose of mere evasion, we have
   a distinction without a difference. We have the same thing presented
   before us under a different name. Under the title of "moral inability,"
   the sinner is informed that he has no power to believe; while, under
   the title, "natural ability," the man is forthwith instructed that he
   possesses full power to believe; and that God himself could not justly
   punish him for unbelief, if he could not believe. Must we be charged
   with being uncharitable, because we call this a manifest contradiction?
   Is it uncharitable to speak the truth in love? We feel it to be
   painful, but we do not admit it to be uncharitable, to speak of that
   whereby esteemed brethren are themselves deceived, and whereby they
   most unintentionally deceive and ruin immortal souls, and to call it by
   its proper name. We use the words of the most charitable among living
   divines when we say to our fellow-sinners--"This is all delusion--cheat
   not your souls with words--believe not those who would lay your
   consciences to sleep on the pillow of an imaginary inability."

   The esteemed writer from whom these words are again quoted, immediately
   adds, "Unwillingness is the word." Here is "the word"--What means this
   "word"? Dr. Wardlaw means by it inability to will. But while the doctor
   evidently refers to "beloved Ultra-Calvinistic brethren," against whose
   teaching he warns his fellow-sinners, when he says, "believe not those
   who would lay your consciences to sleep on the pillow of an imaginary
   inability;" and while we admit that there is ample room for the
   faithful warning, ought we not to say to the doctor--"Physician heal
   thyself"? Does he not differ from those divines against whose
   pernicious doctrine he so faithfully warns men only in words--mere
   words? What is the alteration which the doctor proposes? It is the
   change of a word! "Unwillingness [says he] is the word." The brethren
   against whose teaching Dr. Wardlaw lifts his faithful voice inculcate
   the notion of inability to do. Dr. Wardlaw himself inculcates the
   sinner's inability to will to do. No wonder that the same "Alliance,"
   styled "Evangelical," can contain them both. They can shake hands over
   the inability! But we humbly submit that if this inability be, as this
   doctor says it is, in the one case "imaginary," it is no less imaginary
   in both cases. Dr. Candlish very justly observes respecting it,
   somewhere in his attempts to combat Dr. Wardlaw's unanswerable
   arguments in favour of a universal atonement, that this is merely
   removing the inability into "a niche farther back." It is merely
   assigning to it a different position in the unbroken and indestructible
   chain of necessity! Call it natural, or call it moral, or call it by
   any fine name you choose--it is inability after all--"an imaginary
   inability."

   If we were, therefore, unhappily compelled to make our choice between
   two evils, we should choose the least, and adhere the rather to Dr.
   Candlish and "those" against whose pernicious teaching Dr. Wardlaw
   lifts his warning voice. We hesitate not to say to our
   semi-brethren--pernicious as the out-and-out orthodox teaching
   admittedly is, it is not by any means so pernicious as your own; and
   the reason is, that it is far more honest and consistent with itself,
   and far less truckling and deceptive, than is that half-and-half
   Calvinism which a miserable expediency has originated and patronized.
   Your system is a mere catch-penny system--it is no system at all. It
   wants the consistency even of error, and down it must speedily fall of
   its own accord. It has already slipped away out of the hands of all
   those who have preceded the Congregationalists and the "United Church"
   in their march out of Calvin-land, and it is our happiness to
   anticipate the time when it will be no longer expedient for the
   expediency brethren to retain it.

   What is YOUR gospel, which you call it uncharitable to denounce as an
   imposition and a cheat? You go to the dungeon of the condemned man, and
   you tell him that you are the bearers of good news--"good tidings of
   great joy." You say to him that he has perfect freedom to enter the
   palace of his sovereign, and ask and obtain whatever he desires. And at
   this announcement the poor man's heart begins to leap for gladness. But
   you point him instantly to the bolts and bars and heavy chains which
   bind him to his prison-house, and you remind him that he has not the
   power to move, and you have no authority to set him free from the spot
   to which he is bound! And yet you say to him that he has the power to
   enter the palace, and you entreat him to enter, and you rebuke him
   because he is not found at the foot of the throne asking and obtaining
   whatever his heart desires!! Is not this the very essence of absurdity?
   Does it not amount to the most deliberate cruelty thus to insult and
   mock and tantalize the miserable and the unfortunate? WHY? Simply
   because you know that the poor man has not the power to move from his
   dungeon, and you admit he must first of all walk outside of that
   dungeon before it is possible for him to approach the palace of his
   sovereign. True, indeed, IF the poor man were once disengaged from his
   fetters and out of his prison-house, he has the power to walk up to the
   palace. And YOUR gospel depends upon this miserable "IF"!! The man has
   the power to take the second step, IF the first step were once
   accomplished! But the first step he has no power to take! Why, then,
   not deal HONESTLY with the poor man at once, and say plainly to him
   that you have NO GOSPEL to him at all?

   But such is the sum and substance of the gospel which you have for
   sinners of the human race. It sounds at first like music from on high.
   It falls upon the ears of your hearers like sounds of sweetest melody.
   It is so free!--it is so full! It takes within its ample grasp the
   world--the whole world "without distinction and without exception!" But
   examine it--and what is there in it all for any sinner to cling to in
   the hour of need? Simply an assurance that the man is able to save
   himself without the Holy Spirit! Here is one side of your vaunted
   gospel, and looking at it in this, its most unlimited aspect, it
   amounts to a downright falsehood. But turn round the other side which
   embraces not the world, but takes in exclusively "the special few," and
   what does this "gospel" say? It assures men that they have no power to
   will--no power to take the first, the essential step back again to
   God--no power to will even to consider what the Holy Ghost says unto
   them--but that an iron chain of necessity binds their will down to the
   dark prison of their unbelief, until a special, direct, mystical,
   irresistible, and inexplicable influence shall, somehow or other, burst
   their fetters and set them free! Here, then, is the other aspect of
   what you call gospel, and looking at it in this "special reference" we
   find it to involve another falsehood, no less destructive than the
   former.

   "Now, my fellow-sinners, this is all delusion." So truly has Dr.
   Wardlaw spoken of the system which has been examined in the first four
   of the Lectures, which we have been privileged to deliver in your
   hearing. We think we are warranted to apply the doctor's own expressive
   words to his own theology; and while we do so, we trust that while we
   condemn the system of this excellent writer no less strongly than he
   himself condemns the system of those whom he still loves as brethren,
   we shall not be awanting in cultivating towards him, and all from whom
   we differ, the same spirit of expansive charity. But we want more than
   mere verbal charity;--we want charity in deed; and we are therefore
   desirous that our brethren who are most industrious in circulating
   against us the slanderous charge of denying the necessity of the Holy
   Spirit's needful influence, would be so charitable as gird themselves
   to the task of proving what they gratuitously assert, and charitably
   pointing out to all men, if they can, from the Word of God, that the
   truth which we maintain involves the error which they are pleased
   calumniously to charge against it. We have ventured to show our
   brethren what we deem an example of charity, when we have not only
   asserted, but endeavoured at great length to prove, that the system
   which they themselves patronize involves a denial of the great truth
   for which all Christian men must ever be forward earnestly to contend.

   We have most gratefully availed ourselves of the admissions which our
   brethren have made, as the result of Scripture examination and clear
   and solid proof which has not been, and cannot be, successfully met and
   overthrown. They have proved that Jesus died for all men, and that all
   men without exception are able to believe. This they have proved,--this
   we have admitted; and so far we have gratefully and joyfully accepted
   of their Scriptural and enlightened concessions. But when they come in
   with their "special influence," we ask them, how they reconcile this
   with what they have proved to be true in reference to every sinner's
   perfect ability to believe, and we are informed in reply, that the
   sinner is able to believe without it. We then ask, what they mean by
   this special influence. They inform us that they mean to describe
   thereby the influence which precedes the sinner's will, and must needs
   take the precedency of the sinner's will, before the sinner can
   believe--the influence of the Holy Ghost. Here it is that we pause and
   take leave to dispute with our brethren the truthfulness of their
   theory. We admit that the Holy Spirit's influence must needs precede
   the sinner's will before it is possible for the man either to will
   aright or to believe aright; but it is evident that this influence,
   whatever be its nature, cannot be "special" or exclusively restricted
   to the elect alone, unless it be true that the elect only are possessed
   of the ability to believe. But our brethren have proved that all men,
   without exception, are able to believe, and are therefore justly
   punishable for unbelief. We leave them therefore to take their choice
   between the denial of what they have proved to be true; or the denial
   of the necessity of the Holy Spirit in order to the production of
   faith; or the abandonment of their theory of election, whereby the
   influence of the Spirit is falsely imagined to be specially and
   exclusively confined to the elect. Our heart's desire and prayer for
   our brethren is, that they may speedily abandon this last-mentioned
   error, and come forth consistently in the strength of the Lord, to the
   acknowledgment of THE WHOLE TRUTH.

LECTURE EIGHTH.

   ELECTION TO A SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT--OPPOSED TO
   THE SCRIPTURE TESTIMONY RESPECTING THE NATURE OF DIVINE
   INFLUENCE--DIVINE DRAWING IDENTIFIED WITH DIVINE TEACHING--MAY BE
   RESISTED--"THE SPIRITS IN PRISON"--THE MURDERERS OF STEPHEN--THE THEORY
   OF A COMMON DIVINE INFLUENCE WHICH CANNOT SAVE--THE SPIRIT WORKS BY
   MEANS.

   GEN. vi. 3.--"My Spirit shall not always strive with man."

   ACTS vii. 57.--"Ye do always RESIST THE HOLY GHOST; as your fathers
   did, so do ye."

   JOHN vi. 45.--"It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all
   taught of God. Every man, therefore, that hath heard and hath learned
   of the Father cometh unto me."

   I WISH you, my friends, to examine the doctrine of election, which we
   are now considering, in the light of the Holy Scriptures, and, with
   that view, I have already directed your attention to several plain and
   simple texts, whose testimony no candid man can possibly overlook or
   disregard. And I now close the consideration of this important subject
   by inviting your attention to one other general remark. We object to
   this doctrine of election, because,

   IV. IT IS OPPOSED TO THE SCRIPTURE STATEMENTS WHICH POINT OUT TO US THE
   NATURE OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT.

   The Word of God not only asserts the necessity of the Spirit's work--it
   speaks very plainly of the nature of that work in the conversion of the
   soul. It tells us precisely what is the kind of influence which the
   Spirit exerts upon the souls of men in order to bring them back to God.
   It is styled a "drawing" of the soul on the part of God; it is a
   persuasive influence, adapted by infinite wisdom, to the nature of the
   soul; it is not like that influence which is exerted upon inert and
   unconscious and unthinking matter; it is such influence as is adapted
   to the nature and properties of mind. It is not the turning of a
   mountain, but the revolution of a mind; not the dragging of a body, but
   the drawing of a soul, which this influence seeks to effect. And
   accordingly, we find the Sacred Scriptures representing the matter
   exactly in this light. We cannot conceive of a more direct or explicit
   statement upon this point than what is embodied in John vi. 45, wherein
   our Saviour himself very clearly intimates to his disciples the precise
   manner in which the Father draws. We have seen that, in the 44th verse,
   he asserts the absolute and indispensable necessity of the influence in
   order to enable any man to come to him--"No man can come to me, except
   the Father who hath sent me draw him." But he immediately instructs us
   respecting the nature of this influence--he instantly informs us in
   what way the Father draws, when he adds, "It is written in the
   prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man, therefore,
   that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me." You
   will observe the precise phraseology which our Saviour uses, with the
   evident design of anticipating and correcting the blunders into which
   dreamy and mystifying theologians should be apt to fall.. He does not
   use the expression "draweth" at all in the 45th verse. He uses the
   expressions, "taught of God," "heard and learned of the Father;" and
   observe, more particularly still, our Saviour uses these expressions in
   order to render it impossible for any man, without the most obvious
   perversion of his words, to affirm that the drawing is anything
   different from the teaching, or the hearing and learning of the Father,
   anything different from the soul's voluntary submission to the drawing
   influence of the Spirit. It is impossible for any man to come without
   the drawing influence; but all men are taught of God, and every man who
   hears and learns of this divine teacher, infallibly cometh unto Christ.
   Such is our Saviour's statement. Do you not see, therefore, that the
   drawing of the Spirit and the teaching of the Spirit are here
   identified? Is it not plain, from these words, that the Spirit draws by
   teaching, and that wherever the Spirit teaches there he draws, and that
   whosoever listens to his teaching, and learns at his feet, actually
   cometh unto Jesus? The persuasive influence of the Holy Spirit, whereby
   he draws men to Jesus and to happiness, is here strongly contrasted
   with the opposing influence of the Scribes and Pharisees, whereby the
   souls of the people were seduced away from Christ. And whereas those
   infatuated men and women who submitted to be taught by those erring
   teachers, and heard and learned at their feet, did not and could not
   come to Jesus, it was very different with those who regarded the
   teaching of God the Spirit rather than the fallible and erroneous
   teaching of fallible men; for while the former could not possibly come
   to Christ, every one of the latter "who hath heard and learned of the
   Father [Jesus emphatically declares] cometh unto me."

   You see, therefore, how it is that the Spirit of God draws the human
   soul; it is by his own infallible teaching. And you see, farther, how
   it is that any soul is drawn by the Spirit; it is by disregarding the
   mere teaching of mere men, who would set up their own fallible creeds
   and confessions and catechisms and sermons, as if they were to be
   placed upon a level with the Word of God, thereby, like the ancient
   Pharisees, setting aside, by their traditions, the Scriptures of truth.
   It is by setting aside all such mere human authority--by disregarding
   all such fallible and priestly dictation to the conscience--by
   elevating the Word of God to its legitimate position of supremacy above
   all human creeds--by acting out practically the great principle of the
   Reformation, and practically asserting, in the face of an aspiring and
   ignorant clergy, the right and duty of private individual judgment as
   to the Scriptures of truth--by every man remembering that it is not to
   his ministers or elders, but to his God, that he is responsible for his
   belief; or (to use the language of Jesus himself, in the verse we are
   now considering) it is by hearing and learning of the Father, as he
   speaks by the Spirit in the Bible, that men are drawn of God, and
   brought to Christ and to happiness.

   But while such is the doctrine of the verse before us, that doctrine is
   denied and set aside, in order to make room for the strange notion of
   election we are now engaged in examining. You have already seen that,
   in order to bolster up this strange notion, its advocates find it
   necessary to maintain that sinners are quite able to believe, and do
   all their duty, without the influence of the Spirit; but, in connexion
   with this, they hold the theory of a special influence, which they
   inform us is directly and mysteriously exerted upon the minds of the
   elect, in order to make them willing to believe, and which is withheld
   from all the rest of the human race, who, if they were only willing,
   could be saved without it. This thing, then, which they call a special
   influence, is not the influence of the divine teaching. It is not the
   influence exerted upon the soul when the soul hears and learns of the
   Father. We are told that it is something else--something different
   from--something over and above that influence of which alone our
   Saviour speaks, in the 44th and 45th verses of the sixth chapter of
   John's gospel. We have demanded to know what it is, and where it is
   spoken of in the Word of God--and, strange to say, its supporters
   cannot tell! They cannot inform us what this special influence is! But
   what is still more strange, whenever we come to press them for proof of
   its existence, from the Word of God, they refer us to such passages as
   those we are now considering; but whenever we begin to examine these
   passages, we find that they inform us distinctly of the reality and
   necessity and distinctive nature of the Spirit's work. These texts
   inform us that the Spirit works by means--that he draws men to Jesus by
   presenting truth before their minds--that it is only when taught of
   God, and when they hear and learn of the Father, they ever come to
   Christ. But this is the very thing which these electionists deny. They
   deny the doctrine so plainly stated in the very passages of Scripture
   which are most frequently upon their lips!--And it is because they deny
   what we submit to you Christ plainly says, about the nature of divine
   drawing--(when he exhibits it not as direct or without means, but as
   exerted by means of teaching or instruction, and when he thereby
   exhibits it, not as physical but moral in its nature),--that we hold
   their doctrine to amount to a mere figment of the human imagination.

   But I here call your attention to a somewhat more tangible feature of
   this dreamy and mystical theology. We are informed by its supporters,
   that this special influence whereby the work of the Spirit is set
   aside, is altogether irresistible. We are not informed what it is,
   although we are told that it is not divine teaching: But when we come
   to inquire a little more closely into the matter, we are told that
   whatever it be, it cannot be resisted by any sinner on whose mind it is
   once exerted. This additional piece of information seems to us quite
   decisive, in order to stamp this special influence as a mere delusion.
   It cannot be the influence of the Holy Ghost--whatever men may choose
   to call it. And the reason why we speak so decidedly here, is, that the
   Bible speaks decidedly upon this particular point. And here, my
   friends, you will find some use for the passages of Scripture which, in
   the outset, I have requested you to mark. We are informed by its
   friends that their "special influence" cannot be resisted, and that it
   is never exerted upon the minds of any of those sinners who perish in
   their unbelief. Well, then, we take our brethren at their word, and we
   say to them--Brethren, that influence of which you speak cannot
   therefore be the influence to which God himself refers, when he says,
   in Genesis vi. 3, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man," for
   there was an influence which was resisted, and overcome by the
   antediluvian transgressors, who, because of their obstinacy and sin,
   were ultimately swept away by the waters of the deluge. The simple
   question here is--did these antediluvian transgressors resist the
   influence of the Holy Spirit or did they not? That these men resisted a
   very powerful influence when they resisted the preaching of Noah, our
   brethren are ready to admit, but they deny that it was the influence of
   the Spirit which was resisted; for if they did not deny this, they
   would need to give up their system of theology which is based upon the
   theory of election, whereby they are taught, that the Spirit of God
   cannot possibly be resisted by any with whom he strives. But I stand
   before you this evening pledged to demonstrate the utter falsehood of
   that theory of election, and the consequent delusiveness of that system
   of theology which is based upon it. And here is one of my proofs--God
   himself gives us to understand that his Spirit strove with the
   antediluvian sinners who finally perished. And have we not a right to
   ask any man who says that God's Spirit did not strive with these men
   (otherwise they would have all been saved),--"Who art thou, O man, that
   repliest against God?" How comes it to pass that proud and vain mortals
   persist in setting up their own imaginations in direct opposition to
   the most obvious truths of God's own Word? It is all for the purpose of
   upholding an unscriptural and soul-destroying system of theology, which
   teaches sinners to believe, that if the spirit of God only strive with
   them they cannot possibly be lost, and which thereby instructs them to
   stifle their consciences, and remain at ease under the garb of a dry
   and fruitless attendance on the means of grace, while they say to their
   souls--"Soul, take thine ease and be at peace, for if the Spirit of God
   only strive with thee, thou canst not possibly be lost." Now, my
   friends, I hesitate not to make my appeal to your own consciences this
   night, while I direct you to this simple statement, "My Spirit shall
   not always strive with man," and just as if I were proposing a question
   to any class of Sabbath--school children, do I ask every one of you to
   say, what the doctrine of this passage is,--Does it not contain the
   doctrine that the Spirit of God did strive with the generation of men
   who existed before the flood? It was not the means of grace merely that
   these men resisted; it was the influence of the Spirit, exerted through
   the instrumentality of the means. I charge you, therefore, this
   evening, to listen to God's Word; and to reject the traditions of men
   which contradict that Word, and would lead you to believe that the
   influence of the Spirit was not exerted upon those men whose spirits
   are now shut up in the prison-house of despair. Permit me here to refer
   you to another inspired condemnation of that doctrine of election which
   is founded upon the error of a special influence. The passage is one
   which bears directly upon the statement from Genesis which we have now
   before us. It is written in 1 Peter iii. 18-20: "For Christ also hath
   once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us
   to God; being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.
   By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; which
   sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited
   in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that
   is, eight souls, were saved by water." Now, here you notice, (1,) That
   Christ preached to the spirits in the prison-house of despair. (2,)
   That the time when Christ preached to those lost and imprisoned spirits
   was in the days of Noah--while yet these spirits now in prison were
   inhabiting their fleshy and mortal tabernacles,--before they were swept
   into prison by the waters of the flood, and while yet the
   long-suffering of God waited for their repentance. (3,) You will
   observe more particularly, that it was by the putting forth of the
   influence of his Spirit upon them, through means of preaching--the
   preaching of Noah, the preacher of righteousness (as we are elsewhere
   informed)--it was by his own Spirit thus striving with them, in order
   to bring them to repentance, that Christ did most earnestly seek to
   prevent those spirits from going down into the prison of everlasting
   woe. Now, can any honest and candid man look such facts--divinely
   recorded facts--as these are, fairly in the face, and at the same time
   affirm, that the influence of the Spirit cannot possibly be resisted? I
   have no doubt, my dear friends, that you see clearly enough the bearing
   of this question upon the great doctrinal point now under discussion.
   You see that if this question be honestly answered as God himself
   answers it, the entire doctrine of election in the faith of which, you,
   and I, and thousands more, were unhappily nursed up from our infancy,
   falls to the ground--a baseless and demolished thing. But if your eye
   does not see farther than this, you will fail to appreciate the
   infinite importance of the question which I am so earnestly pressing
   upon your notice. My fellow-sinners, your own souls, and the souls of
   your children, and the souls of your friends, and the souls of the
   thousands and tens of thousands who even now are posting onwards and
   downwards to the doleful prison-house, are practically interested, and
   will be eternally affected, either for weal or for woe, by the question
   which I now press upon your notice! Does God himself not declare that
   his good Spirit strove, and strove long, and strove earnestly, with
   those lost spirits which are' now in prison, enduring the dreadful
   penalties of their stubborn and unnatural resistance? The teachers to
   whom ye trust, with united voice tell you, "No," for our Confession of
   Faith says, that the influence of the Spirit cannot be resisted! Here,
   then, is a dreadful controversy! It is a controversy between the
   infallible God and fallible men! Men and brethren, on whose side are ye
   resolved to stand? Will ye idolize men because these men are called
   ministers of Christ? Will ye stand out striving with your Maker, and
   confronting the truth of God by a blasphemous contradiction, and stay
   your souls any longer upon a mere arm of flesh? Can you forget that it
   is thus written, "Cursed be the man who putteth his trust in man"? I
   appeal, therefore, this night, from the verdict of the men who teach
   you, to the infallible verdict of the living God--the God of truth, who
   cannot possibly lie and who cannot possibly be mistaken; and in
   opposition to Scotland's vaunted theology--whereby the people of my
   native land have been too long deceived and deluded, and, in too many
   instances, eternally ruined--do I this night declare, that there is not
   a soul among you all with whom the Spirit does not earnestly strive;
   and that if any of you perish, your blood is on your own heads, and ye
   shall go down into despair resisting the influence of the Holy Spirit,
   whereby every soul of you may happily be saved!

   But this leads me to call up before you another infallible witness in
   support of the position I am now seeking to maintain,--it is the
   testimony of the Spirit himself, speaking through the lips of a dying
   martyred saint, to which I now summon your attention. You find it
   written down in Acts vii. 21: "Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as
   your fathers did, so do ye." In the face of this evidence, we are very
   coolly informed, by our modern theologians, that the Holy Ghost cannot
   be resisted! Well, then, my fellow-men, it is not for me to dictate,
   but it is for you, as in the sight of God, to make your choice. Which
   will ye believe? Choose ye between the Word of God and the traditions
   of fallible men, and say which ye will believe! Do you ask me to inform
   you how it is possible for them to meet such evidence as this, and yet
   retain their soul-destroying doctrines? You may well propose the
   question, and I shall now try, as briefly as I can, to answer it. This
   evidence splits them up into two parties, who each endeavour vainly to
   assail it from two very different points. One party says" These men did
   not resist the Holy Ghost at all--it was only the preaching of the
   apostles, and the miraculous evidence by which it was proved to be
   divine, that the men resisted." Another party rejoins--"It was not the
   proper influence--the special influence--the only influence which
   converts the soul, that these men resisted--for this we hold it to be
   impossible for any man to resist--they resisted the common influence of
   the Spirit, which is not, properly speaking, the influence of the
   Spirit at all, since it never did, and never can, convert a single soul
   to God." Such is the double battery which Calvinists have erected, in
   order to assail this impregnable fortress of the truth of God, and
   thereby, if possible, save from destruction their "horrible decree."
   But most evident it is, that both parties fail so much as to touch the
   real point of assault. That point is involved and exhibited in the very
   distinct assertion of the Word of God, wherein we are plainly informed,
   that the murderers of Stephen were going down to hell resisting, in
   their downward progress, the true and proper influence of the Holy
   Ghost, which was drawing and inviting them upwards to heaven: they were
   posting onwards to destruction in spite of all the efforts of the Holy
   Ghost to save them. Now, it will not do for one set of Calvinists to
   tell us that these infatuated men did not resist the Holy Ghost at all,
   but that they simply resisted the means of grace, which in themselves
   can never save a single soul. We admit that they resisted the means of
   grace, but we maintain that they resisted more than the means, for we
   are distinctly informed that they resisted the Holy Ghost himself.

   Do you not observe the recklessness with which those assailants assault
   the Scriptures of truth? In a former Lecture, we quoted to you a
   passage from one of their books, wherein they endeavour to prove that
   any sinner who chooses, may be saved without the Holy Ghost altogether.
   You will remember that the writer quoted the verse wherein Paul says to
   Timothy, that from a child he had known the Holy Scriptures, which are
   able to make men wise unto salvation; and because Paul does not mention
   the name of the Holy Ghost in that particular connexion, it was
   maintained by this writer, that Paul inculcates the doctrine that any
   sinner who chooses may easily become wise unto salvation, without the
   influence of the Spirit. Now, here is a passage where the Holy Ghost is
   expressly named, and where not one word is said about the Scriptures
   and the means of grace; and what do those reckless perverters of God's
   word now do? They reverse their own system of interpretation
   altogether, by overlooking the distinct mention that is here made of
   the Holy Spirit, and insisting that this Scripture passage does not
   refer to the Spirit at all, but only to the means of grace! In speaking
   of one passage where the Scriptures are mentioned, but where the Spirit
   is not named, they insist that no reference whatever is made, even by
   implication, to the Spirit. And this they do in order to bolster up
   their doctrine, that the Spirit is not needed to enable any sinner to
   be saved! But when you take them to another passage, where the Holy
   Ghost is expressly named and where the means of grace are not
   mentioned, they exactly reverse their former principle of
   interpretation, and insist, that though the Holy Ghost is named, he is
   not at all referred to in the text; and though the Scriptures are not
   named, they, along with the other means of grace, are exclusively
   referred to! And this they do for the same reason as before--they must
   at all hazards uphold their system of theology, and hold by a special,
   irresistible influence, in order to keep up their theory of election,
   and avert its threatened destruction! The truth of God needs to be
   defended by no such unseemly weapons. We have mentioned to you before,
   that where the Scriptures, or other means of grace are mentioned, the
   Holy Spirit is not thereby excluded. And so, when it is said--"The
   Scriptures are able to make men wise unto salvation," it is not implied
   that the Scriptures are able to do this without the influence of the
   Spirit. And so here, when it is said to men who perished--"Ye do always
   resist the Holy Ghost," the Scriptures and other means of grace are not
   excluded, and it is not implied that these murderers did not resist the
   means; but what we affirm is, they resisted more than the means--they
   resisted the influence of the Holy Ghost himself--that very influence
   whereby the Spirit saves the soul.

   I submit, therefore, to your unprejudiced and honest judgments, whether
   it be not unanswerably proved, by the text before you, that the Holy
   Ghost has been resisted, and may therefore again be resisted, by the
   sinners with whom he strives. But what do we make of the other mode of
   interpretation whereby the force of the passage is sometimes evaded? We
   are told that it is the common influence of the Spirit which is here
   said to be resisted; and when we ask what is the meaning of the
   expression, a common influence, we are informed that it is an influence
   whereby God does not mean to save, and which cannot save the soul. This
   is what we are told. But the all-important question is, BY WHOM are we
   told this?--to whom are we indebted for this marvellous piece of
   information, about an influence of the Spirit which cannot possibly
   save any sinner's soul? and on whose authority are we called upon to
   believe in it? This will not be said to be an unreasonable demand. Let
   us see one solitary passage in the whole Bible which speaks of an
   influence of the Holy Ghost which needs to be supplemented by another
   kind of Divine influence, in order to become adequate to the salvation
   of the soul, and we shall instantly believe. But of all the absurdities
   of error, this is the most absurd! Of all the weak positions which
   erring men are compelled to occupy, this is the most weak and
   infantile. And hence it is, that even among Modern Calvinists, it is
   only "the weaker brethren" who are found to skulk into this most
   unscriptural position. Every reader of his Bible knows well, that there
   are not two kinds of ordinary Divine influence spoken of throughout its
   pages. There is not a work of the Holy Ghost for all men, and another
   work or influence of a different kind for the elect only, spoken of in
   the Scriptures. There are, indeed, miraculous gifts, and gifts of
   inspiration referred to; but these are not surely included in what is
   called the common influence, which all men are said, by this
   hypothesis, to possess, though it never can save a single soul; and
   these are not included by our brethren in the thing which they call a
   special influence, which they say is irresistible. And there are
   different degrees of Divine influence referred to in the Bible--one man
   possessing comparatively less of the Spirit than another, and all being
   commanded to be "filled with the Spirit." But we challenge any man to
   adduce one single passage of Scripture which so much as hints at two
   separate and distinct kinds of influence--the one common to all men,
   but which cannot save, and never did save a single soul--the other
   confined exclusively to the elect, but which, from its very nature,
   cannot possibly be resisted. The truth is, that as there is one God and
   Father of all, and one Lord and Saviour of all, even so there is but
   one Spirit who strives with all, and who saves and sanctifies all those
   who believe. And as there is one Spirit, so there is but one kind of
   spiritual influence, which is common to all men, and which, when any
   man resists, he resists the Holy Ghost. Neither are we left in
   ignorance as to the nature of this influence, for it is said in the
   text we are now considering, "Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as
   your fathers did, so do ye." Now, that it is resistible by men, is
   obvious at the very first reading of the verse. But when the question
   is put, How does the Spirit exert his influence?--is it directly upon
   the soul, or by means, and through the instrumentality of truth? we
   have only to betake ourselves, not to the dreams and speculations of
   fallible men, far less to the musty creeds of men who most religiously
   murdered their fellow creatures, on the charge of witchcraft!--"we have
   a more sure word of prophecy, to which we would do well to take heed."
   The text refers us to the fact, that as their fathers resisted the Holy
   Ghost, so did they. Now the question is--Does the word of God supply us
   with information as to the way in which their fathers resisted the
   Spirit? It does. Turn with me, therefore, for example, to the ninth
   chapter of the book of Nehemiah, verses 20th and 30th. "Thou gavest
   also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna
   from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst." And again
   (ver. 30), "Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedest
   against them by the Spirit in thy prophets; yet would they not give
   ear." Thus was it that the fathers of Stephen's murderers resisted the
   Holy Ghost; and thus did these their children resist the Holy Ghost;
   and thus does every sinner on the face of the earth resist the Holy
   Ghost, who refuses to believe the testimony of the Spirit, speaking
   through means of the Scriptures, and to enter into the possession of
   eternal life. It is thus by means that God the Father draws the sinner
   to himself; and it is only when the sinner hears and learns of the
   Father, speaking to all men by his Spirit through the Word, that he
   cometh unto Jesus, and finds rest unto his weary soul. [6]

   And now, my friends, I have done with this unscriptural theory of
   election, the falsehood of which I have endeavoured, in the four last
   Lectures, to establish. We shall very speedily, if God spare us
   together, come to set before you a theory of election from the Word of
   God which excludes none of you from salvation, but which is gloriously
   consistent with the gospel message which comes to every sinner on the
   face of the earth. We have said that we shall do this, if God shall be
   pleased to spare us together. But, beloved friends, there is much in
   that little word "IF." It may be that we shall not all meet again
   beneath the sun--it may be, that we shall not all meet until we shall
   face each other before the judgment-seat of Christ. My friends, God is
   my witness when I assure you, that the glorious truth which I am feebly
   endeavouring to set before you, gives MY sinful and guilty and
   hell-deserving soul glorious hope in the prospect of that day. I tell
   you more, when I assure you, that I too once preached the very error
   which I have been endeavouring to expose, and against which, to my
   dying hour, and with my latest breath, I--would warn my fellow-men.
   That doctrine never gave me peace in the prospect of meeting with my
   God. It never assured even the preacher himself, that he was one of the
   elect. The preacher knew he was "the chief of sinners;" but how could
   he know that he was one of the special favourites of God without a
   special revelation, which to him was never once vouchsafed? My dear
   friends--may I not add, my fellow-sinners--sinners against God as well
   as he who now speaks to you--are ye possessed of another revelation
   different from that which lies before me? Have your teachers furnished
   you with a Bible to the elect? Have you g6t from them a message which
   will serve you in the face of death, judgment, and eternity, if their
   doctrine of election be not all a fable? If God has indeed brought only
   some among you into existence under the possibility of being saved, is
   it possible for you to know which of you is interested in the love
   of--God, so as to cherish good hope beyond the grave.? It is impossible
   I But I have proved to you that the current doctrine of election is a
   falsehood and a lie; therefore, I say, it is not impossible for you
   this very evening to come to peace with God through the knowledge of
   his love--his matchless love to you as well as to me. There is no
   Divine influence kept back from you. No. "He that spared not his own
   Son, but gave him up to the death for you all, shall he not with him
   also freely give you all things?" Think you, then, that when he gave
   his Son, he will withhold the needful influence of his Spirit? Think
   you that he will hold you guilty for not believing, and yet keep back
   the one thing needful to enable you to believe? No, brethren. You have
   something to believe, and that something is true; and that something is
   not bad news, but good tidings of great joy to every one of you, in the
   solemn prospect of "THAT DAY," till which, I have said, we may never
   all meet again. But what is that something which you are bound to
   believe, and which, if you do not believe, you make the God of truth a
   liar to his face? Tell me, my beloved friends, what you would like it
   to be? In the face of death and judgment, what, my fellow-sinner, would
   be good news to thy sinful soul? Riches? Honours? No! no! These will
   not comfort thee at the hour of death! What if, at that solemn hour, an
   angel from on high were to descend and sing--"Fear not: for unto thee
   was born a Saviour! and that Saviour bare thy sins in his own body on
   the tree! and that Saviour hath sent me down to assure thee, sinner, of
   his love; and, through his blood, to proclaim to thee the pardon of thy
   sins!" You say--"Give me an angel's word and then I will believe, and
   will not fear to face my God." My fellow-sinner, I point thee to more
   than an angel's word! I point thee away from the errors of men to the
   Word of the Holy Spirit. In that Word there is truth--in that Word
   there is power, the power of God unto salvation to every one that
   believeth. That Word is the word of the gospel, with which the Spirit
   approaches thy sinful soul, and says that Jesus loved thee! and shed
   his blood for thee! and that pardon through that blood is proclaimed to
   thee! Such is the testimony of the Spirit to every sinner in this house
   to-night--such is the good tidings of great joy which, not an angel,
   but God himself addresses to you all! O then, friends, believe Him even
   now, and yield to his truth even now, for, "Behold, now is the accepted
   time; behold, now is the day of salvation."

LECTURE NINTH.

   THE BIBLE DOCTRINE OF ELECTION--ELECTION, THE ACT OF
   SEPARATION--SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD--SEPARATION BY GOD--ULTIMATE AND
   SUBORDINATE OBJECTS OF ELECTION--DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF
   ELECTION--SEPARATION THROUGH MEANS--"MAKE YOUR CALLING AND ELECTION
   SURE"--IMPORTANCE OF HOLINESS.

   EPHES. i. 4.--"According as he hath chosen us in him before the
   foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame
   before him in love."

   2 THESS. ii. 13.--"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for
   you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
   chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit, and
   belief of the truth."

   1 PETER i. 2.--"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
   through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of
   the blood of Jesus Christ."

   2 PETER i. 10.--"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make
   your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall
   never fall."

   THE question which falls now to be considered, is one of engrossing
   interest. It is a question which lies at the foundation of all
   theology, and which is indissolubly connected with the eternal
   destinies of every soul of the human race. WHAT IS ELECTION? (,) What
   is the true and proper import of the term? (2,) What is the actual
   state of things which is necessarily and really presupposed by the
   electing process? (3,) Who is the sole and exclusive agent by whom the
   process of election is conducted? (4,) What is the grand ultimate end
   which God has in view, and what the proximate or subordinate objects
   which God in election proposes to accomplish? These are four
   preliminary questions which we wish you this evening to answer
   preparatory to the great fundamental question--WHAT IS ELECTION? And
   the solution of each and all of these subordinate points will open up
   the way for a brief exposition of a doctrine which, to this hour, has
   not met with that attention, nor occupied that position in the minds of
   men, which is everywhere assigned to it in the Word of God.

   I. WHAT THEN IS THE IMPORT OF THE WORD?

   It denotes the act, or process of separation, when one object is
   selected or set apart from other surrounding objects. Observe what we
   say. It is the act, or process of selection or separation. This is a
   remark so very plain and simple, that you are very apt to pass it over
   and to dismiss it from your minds by a mere cursory glance. But you
   will see the error of such conduct, when I inform you, that this
   remark, simple and plain and self-evident as it is, lies at the very
   foundation of the subject we are now seeking to expound to you. The
   truth is, that all error is the result of overlooking the most obvious
   facts. Men suppose that such things are so plain that they cannot
   possibly be denied, and it is here that the deceiver of souls gets
   advantage over his votaries. He gets them to forget altogether the
   plainest axioms. He leads them astray from truth, and astray from God,
   and astray from everlasting happiness, by making them careless about
   first principles, which are so obvious and so simple, that even a child
   may easily apprehend them. The idea of ELECTION is familiar to the mind
   of the youngest child who practically exemplifies every day its
   preference of one thing and its aversion to another. The very infant
   upon the breast knows practically what election is. Let it be
   surrounded by a number of strange faces, all seeking to engage its
   attention and to win its preference, and the child will turn away from
   them all, and hide its little face in the bosom of its mother. The
   little one chooses or selects, or sets apart for itself, the object to
   which it instinctively turns from among all the other objects which are
   set before it. There you see an illustration of the great principle
   involved in election. The events of every-day life are pregnant with
   examples. You want a servant to do your work, and many there are who
   are desirous to serve you; but you select one out of the many, and the
   act of separation, whereby you choose and separate one from among all
   the other applicants, is your deed of election. You want a man to
   represent you in the great council of the nation, and many there are
   who solicit your vote; but you fix upon one out of the many, and when
   the day and hour of election comes you hasten to the polling booth, and
   you practically exemplify the true and proper import of the term
   election. You separate the man for whom you vote from all the other
   claimants for your suffrage, and the act of separation is the act of
   election. The word has the same meaning to whatever subject it may
   happen. to be wedded, and by whomsoever the right or privilege of
   election may happen to be exercised. It bears the same meaning in the
   Bible which is attached to it in the ordinary affairs of men. It
   implies the right to choose or to select, and it expresses in every
   instance the act or process of selection.

   You cannot fail to notice the important difference between the purpose
   to select, and the act or process of election. The one exists when you
   have made up your minds how you are to act; the other has no existence,
   and cannot possibly have any existence, until the time when you come to
   carry your purpose into execution. Till then there is not, in point' of
   fact, any election. You may speak indeed improperly and loosely, and
   you may say at the moment your mind is made up how you mean to act,
   that very moment the election, so far as you are concerned, is
   virtually decided. But, even when you do thus express yourselves, you
   do not mean to intimate that the electing process is already past. It
   is not the act or process of separation, but the purpose or decision of
   your mind, which, strictly and properly speaking, is the thing referred
   to when you say, that the election, so far as you are concerned, is
   decided whenever your mind is made up. In this case it is not election
   in fact, but election in purpose of which you speak. It is not THE ACT
   of selection or separation, but THE PURPOSE to elect which is indicated
   by your words. I have said that this distinction is important, and I
   now add, that it is a distinction which is paramount in importance. It
   is so very important, that if you fail to appreciate it and fully to
   understand it, you disqualify yourselves, in the very outset, for
   apprehending the great Bible doctrine of election altogether. But
   surely it is not difficult to understand this simple and important
   distinction. When a man has made up his mind to do anything whatever,
   every man can see clearly the difference between this, and the actual
   performance or execution of the purpose which has thus been formed.
   Now, it is universally admitted, that the term election means strictly
   and properly the actual process of separation. But it is universally
   forgotten that there is a very material difference between the purpose
   to elect or separate, and the actual process itself; which process
   alone is strictly and properly expressed by the term election. Take an
   example of election from the Word of God--the election of Aaron to the
   office of the priesthood. We know that Aaron was in the purpose of God
   elected from eternity to fill the sacerdotal office; but when we speak
   of election from eternity, we refer not to the election properly
   speaking, but to the purpose of God to separate the house of Levi from
   all the other tribes of Israel, in order to minister at the altar. We
   prove to you, from God's own words, that Aaron was not, in point of
   fact, elected by him to fill the sacerdotal office, until after the
   earth had opened her mouth and had swallowed up Korah, Dathan, and
   Abiram, before the eyes of the affrighted multitude, and until after
   the rod of Aaron "budded and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms,
   and yielded almonds" within the tabernacle of the Lord. You have read
   the seventeenth chapter of the book of Numbers, where God says to
   Moses:--(ver. 5,) "And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom
   I SHALL choose, shall blossom." Here then is an example of election on
   the part of God, and God himself speaks of it not as a past or present,
   but as a future act. The election of Aaron, on the part of God, did not
   take place until Aaron was ACTUALLY SET APART to fill the sacerdotal
   office. In accordance with this example of election, you will
   understand the strict and proper import of the word. Properly
   understood, it means, and can mean nothing less and nothing else, than
   the actual process or deed of separation; and when it is spoken of as
   eternal, the reference is not to election properly so called, but to
   election in purpose, which is not the election itself, but the purpose
   to elect. There are many elections spoken of in the Scriptures of
   truth. There is angelical election, for we read of "elect angels;"
   there is a national election, for we read of the election of the Jewish
   nation, who were separated by God from all the surrounding nations as
   his peculiar people; there is, as we have seen, a sacerdotal election,
   as in the case of Aaron and the sons of Levi to the priestly office;
   there is a regal election, as in the separation of Saul, and after him
   of David the son of Jesse, to wield the sceptre and sit upon the throne
   and wear the crown; there is a mediatorial election, for Jesus the Son
   of God was styled "mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth," and
   separated or set aside from all the beings in the universe to stand
   between an offended God and a rebel world; and there is evangelical
   election, which consists in the separation of all who believe the
   gospel from the world around them, and such is that election of which
   we now speak.

   Now what we wish you to notice is, that in all election, whether
   angelical or national or sacerdotal or regal or mediatorial or
   evangelical, there is the uniform development of the grand fundamental
   principle to which we now specially and particularly refer. In every
   instance, the election is nothing more and nothing less and nothing
   else than the act or process of separation itself, as distinguished
   from the purpose so to separate, or choose, or pick out, or select. The
   purpose is one thing, the election is another and separate thing
   altogether. The purpose is something in the mind of God; the election
   is the actual separation, which has no actual existence, and cannot
   possibly have any actual existence, until the purpose conies to be
   developed and carried into execution.

   II. OUR SECOND INQUIRY NOW RELATES TO THE ACTUAL STATE OF THINGS
   PRESUPPOSED BY THE VERY EXISTENCE OF ELECTION.

   The very idea of angelical election presupposes the existence of other
   angels from whom the elect angels were separated; and so there could be
   no such thing as national election, if there had not existed at the
   period of separation other nations from whom the peculiar people were
   picked out and set aside. And it would be absurd to speak of an
   election or choosing of one man and his tribe to the priestly office,
   without at the same time assuming the existence of other men and other
   tribes, from among whom the chosen one was separated and set apart. And
   so, to come at once to the election of which we speak, it would be
   absurd in the extreme to speak of an actual selection or separation of
   believing men and women, without supposing the actual existence of a
   mass of unbelieving persons, from among whom the elect are separated.
   Is it not manifest at a single glance, that the act or process of
   separation, implies not only the actual existence of the persons who
   are separated, or elected, or chosen, but the equally actual existence
   of the very individual persons from among whom the elect are so
   separated and chosen? Is it not a monstrous absurdity to speak of AN
   ACTUAL selection and separation of a multitude of nonentities from
   among a host of other similar nonentities? It is not thus that the
   Bible instructs us, and it is not over a universe of mere ideas that
   Jehovah reigns. There was once an ideal philosophy which has been
   happily exploded and put to flight by a strong appeal to the common
   sense and the every-day apprehensions of mankind; and we still live
   under the reign of an IDEAL THEOLOGY which is already beginning to
   totter toward its downfall before the common sense of men who are
   content to make their appeal to, and draw their religion from, the
   infallible Word of the infallible God. It is not from among a
   generation of phantoms that the selection of which we speak is made.
   Jesus said unto some of the separated ones, "I have chosen you out of
   the world." It was not out of an ideal world, but out of an existing
   world--a sinful, Saviour-crucifying and gospel-hating and
   salvation-despising world, that the elect were actually taken and set
   apart for God. You cannot suppose the act of separation as eternal save
   in the sense in which you can suppose the world itself to have existed
   from eternity. It existed from eternity in the mind and purpose of God.
   God purposed from eternity to create it. In like manner as you may
   figuratively and with an exclusive reference to the purpose, speak of
   the world existing from eternity, even so is it figuratively, and with
   a reference solely to purpose, said, that they who are united by faith
   to Christ are in him chosen from eternity. But it is evident to common
   sense itself, that the actual election or separation of some from the
   world--the act or process of choosing or picking them out of the
   world--necessarily presupposes the actual existence, not only of the
   elect themselves, but also of that identical world out of which they
   were literally chosen and actually separated for glory.

   III. OUR THIRD QUESTION RELATES TO THE AGENT BY WHOM THE ACT OF
   SELECTION IS CARRIED INTO EXECUTION.

   And here we need not pause nor hesitate even for a moment--it is God
   alone who elects. But for this, there would be no election--no
   separation from the world at all. Did God not graciously choose us, we
   never could, and never would have been chosen. Here is the grace and
   here the glory of election. It is primarily and exclusively the doing
   of the Lord, and it is wondrous in our eyes. It is to the praise of the
   glory of his grace that there are any brands plucked from the
   burning--it is to the praise of the glory of his grace that there are
   any sinners united to the Saviour--it is to the praise of the glory of
   his grace that there are any souls saved from the pit of destruction,
   and welcomed among the angels of heaven to the regions of immortal
   blessedness. "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be
   all the glory, for thy mercy and thy truth's sake."

   IV. OUR FOURTH INQUIRY RELATES TO THE GRAND ULTIMATE END WHICH GOD HAS
   IN VIEW IN ELECTION, IN CONNEXION WITH--THE PROXIMATE OR SUBORDINATE
   OBJECTS SUBSERVED THEREBY.

   And here be it observed, that the grand ultimate end which God proposes
   here, and in everything that he does, is his own glory. God cannot
   possibly act save for this one grand ultimate object. He would cease to
   be God were he to propose to himself any other end than this. This is
   the highest, the noblest, the most worthy of all possible ends. This,
   therefore, is the only ultimate object and design worthy of a being of
   infinite excellence. The very same reason which would, and does render
   it sinful in any creature to propose to himself his own gratification
   or glory as the grand aim of all his doings, renders it impossible for
   God to propose to himself any other end. The creature is finite and
   dependent and imperfect and fallible; the Creator alone is infinite,
   independent, and infallible. He alone is infinite in every conceivable
   perfection; and he only is necessarily and legitimately the ultimate
   end and origin of all that can be called great or good or wise or holy
   in the wide universe.

   But while the glory of God is the grand ultimate object which he has
   proposed to himself in election and in all that he does, there are
   certain subordinate and proximate ends which he proposes to effect in
   the separation of believers from the world. These proximate and
   subordinate ends are TWO. The one refers to the state, the other to the
   character of those who are the subjects of the separating or electing
   process. In reference to their state, the object which God has in view
   in their election or separation from the world is, their being placed
   in a position wherein they may enjoy daily and hourly access to the
   blood of Christ, and have their consciences sprinkled therewith from
   their daily and hourly shortcomings. In reference to their character,
   it is the design of God in their election to lead them on in a course
   of holy and progressive obedience, and ultimately to bring them forth
   perfect and without blame before him. Such are the two subordinate
   objects which God has in view in the separation or selection of sinners
   out of the world,--the one referring to their state, so that they may
   be partakers of all possible blessedness which they are capable of
   enjoying; and the other referring to their character; so that,
   reflecting the image of God, they may be capable to perform those high
   and exalted duties, and be made meet for those high and holy exercises
   in which it is at once their duty and their privilege to engage. We are
   not left to hesitate or debate for one moment as to these two objects
   being the secondary and proximate objects which God has in view in
   election. As to the first, we are informed in 1 Peter i. 2, that we are
   "elect unto the sprinkling of the blood of Christ." Here, then, is the
   most distinct intimation of the state of privilege into which God does
   in point of fact introduce believers by election. It is unto the daily
   sprinkling of the blood of Christ. So, then, just as they need pardon
   every day, they have freedom of access every day by faith into the
   holiest, having their consciences daily sprinkled with the blood of the
   atonement. And their state of blessedness is not referred to merely by
   the Apostle Peter, for Paul adds his testimony to the same effect, in
   witnessing upon this point. In 2 Thessalonians ii. 13, he reminds
   believers of the state of exalted blessedness to which they were
   chosen, saying, "God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation."
   Such is the state of blessedness, of present and future blessedness,
   which it is one design and object of God to confer by election. To this
   state all who believe are separated. To the enjoyment of the daily
   sprinkling, and the blessed hope of the glorious kingdom--to the
   present and everlasting enjoyment of all that is contained in that
   wondrous word, "SALVATION"--are they separated by--God in the process
   of election.

   But the second proximate object which God has in view, subordinate to
   his own glory, refers to the characters of those who are chosen. They
   are accordingly said by Peter, in the passage before referred to, to be
   elect "unto obedience," as well as unto the daily sprinkling of the
   blood of Christ; and Paul says, in Ephesians i. 4, that they are chosen
   in order that they "should be holy and without blame before him in
   love." Here, then, is the second subordinate object of election clearly
   and distinctly and incontrovertibly announced. It is progressively holy
   obedience here and perfection hereafter, so that we may be without
   blame presented to the Father--without spot, or wrinkle, or any such
   thing. The king's daughter is thus to be adorned without in a robe of
   finest needle-work, being clothed in the righteousness of Christ
   himself; and she is to be all glorious within when, freed from every
   imperfection which cleaves to her here below, she shall meet her
   descending Lord in the clouds, and so be for ever with him in glory.
   Such is the twofold object which God, in election, proposes to
   accomplish, and does, in every instance, most graciously accomplish;
   and these two objects are not, in any case, inconsistent with his
   glory. By them his own glory will be most efficiently promoted and most
   worthily advanced.

   WE NOW COME TO THE MAIN INQUIRY, WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC OR DISTINCTIVE
   NATURE OF ELECTION?

   What is it which God does when he elects, or chooses, or separates
   believers from the world? The twofold object which God has in view in
   separating believers from the world cannot be mistaken, and will not
   here be overlooked. Permit me, therefore, to propose to you the simple
   question, What is it which, in any case, stands out as the hindrance
   towards the effecting of these two subordinate objects whereby, in
   every instance, the glory of God is most effectually advanced? This is
   the great problem to be solved; for it cannot be doubted that God is,
   in no case, uninterested or careless in reference to the advancement of
   his own glory. If you do not doubt this (and it is impossible for any
   man to doubt or question it for an instant), you will surely admit that
   God cannot possibly remain uninterested or careless in reference to the
   salvation of any sinner by whose salvation his glory would undoubtedly
   be advanced. If His glory would be advanced by one sinner being
   separated or elected out of the world, and set apart to the daily
   sprinkling of the blood of Christ, and to obedience, it follows, as a
   necessary consequence, that his glory would be much more illustriously
   manifested by every sinner on the face of the earth being so separated
   to the enjoyment of daily sprinkling and the following of all holiness.
   It is on this ground chiefly that there is joy among the angels over
   every sinner who repenteth. Where, then, lies the hindrance, in: any
   instance, to the advancement of God's glory by the accomplishment of
   this twofold object of election? What is the hindrance, in the first
   place, to any sinner's enjoyment of the daily sprinkling of the blood
   of Christ? It lies in the state of condemnation in which, by his
   unbelief, the man is placed. And where, again, lies the hindrance to
   any sinner's voluntary obedience to God's commandments? It lies in that
   unregenerated heart and nature in which, by his unbelief, the man
   voluntarily remains. Here, then, is the twofold hindrance whereby the
   twofold object which God has in view in election is alone prevented.
   This is the only hindrance which prevents the separation of any, and
   every sinner, on the face of the earth, to the enjoyment of present and
   eternal happiness. Do you ask me then to say what is the distinctive
   nature of election? My reply is, election consists in the removal of
   this twofold hindrance. It does not consist in the removal of the
   condemnation alone--that is an act of God which is called by the name
   of justification;--it does not consist in the removal of the enmity of
   the unregenerated soul alone--that, too, is an act of God, and it is
   called by the name of regeneration;--but let the two be looked at in
   their combined state--look at the removal of the condemnation from the
   sinner's soul in connexion with the removal of the enmity from the
   sinner's heart, and you have a distinct idea of that process of
   separation whereby the sinner is separated "unto obedience and the
   daily sprinkling of the blood of Christ." It is here that you will get
   your minds cleared up so as to have a distinct and definite conception
   before you of the nature of that act of separation which is called by
   the name of election. It is the separation of a condemned and trembling
   spirit to the enjoyment of the daily sprinkling of Christ's blood; and
   so far as this object is to be effected, it cannot be effected save by
   an act of God, who alone can justify. But justification alone is not
   election. It is the process of separation whereby an unregenerated soul
   is brought into a condition of progressive obedience, which shall issue
   in being presented without blame before God at last; and, so far as
   this object is to be effected, it can only be effected by being born
   again, or regenerated by the Spirit of God. But regeneration alone is
   not election. This process of separation, on the part of God, is a
   process whereby (the Word of God distinctly informs us) the twofold
   object of obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ is brought
   about; and, therefore it must, as a matter of necessary consequence,
   consist in the justification and regeneration of the sinner, viewed,
   not separately, but in harmonious combination. We have before told you
   that there is a common principle which all election claims, whether it
   be angelic or national or sacerdotal or regal or mediatorial or
   evangelical. The principle which is common to all is that which
   distinguishes election itself from the purpose to elect; but just as
   there is a principle of agreement which is common to them all, so there
   must be something in each which distinguishes it from all the rest. And
   here we have, accordingly, discovered wherein the distinguishing
   feature of evangelical election consists. It is the process whereby God
   separates a sinner of the human race from other sinners round about
   him, and it consists in the twofold act and process of justification
   and regeneration combined. Both are essential towards the removal of
   the only hindrances which intercept between any sinner and the
   subordinate and ultimate objects of election; and, therefore,
   evangelical election, viewed distinctively from every other election
   whatever, can consist in nothing more, nothing less, nothing else, than
   the conjunct removal of the condemnation and the enmity which are
   peculiar to the unbelieving souls of men.

   The conclusion at which we have thus arrived, is confirmed and
   established from the plainly revealed fact, that the election of which
   we speak is brought about in every instance THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY
   OF MEANS.

   This is an important truth, which is very clearly revealed to us in the
   Word of God. In that passage from the second chapter of second
   Thessalonians, already referred to, the inspired apostle says
   distinctly, that the elect are chosen to salvation "through
   sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth." What can be more
   distinct than this? It is not to sanctification of the Spirit, but
   through sanctification of the Spirit that the process of election is
   carried on by God. It is not to the belief of the truth, but through
   the belief of the truth that we are chosen to salvation. Such a
   distinct revelation as this is decisive of the whole question, by which
   the minds of men have been agitated and convulsed upon the subject of
   elec. tion. The dominant and prevailing theories, the fallacy of which
   has been already very fully pointed out in previous lectures, are every
   one of them based upon the erroneous assumption, that the elect have
   been chosen from eternity to the sanctification of the Spirit and
   belief of the truth. Take away the word "to" which is expressive of an
   end or object to be attained, and substitute in its place the word
   "through," which is expressive not of the end to be attained, but of
   the means whereby any object or end is brought about, and you change
   entirely the whole aspect of the doctrine now under consideration. But
   who has a right to take away what God himself has introduced, and in
   its stead to substitute an expression which alters entirely the whole
   aspect of theology! Who has a right to say that the elect are chosen
   to, when God himself informs us that they are chosen not to but through
   sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth? There may be a
   question started as to the import of the expression, "from the
   beginning" God hath chosen you, but there cannot be any debate about
   the import of the statement, that it is "through the sanctification of
   the Spirit and belief of the truth" the elect are chosen. Some may
   argue that the expression "from the beginning" refers us back to
   eternity, while others may contend that the apostle refers to the
   beginning of their Christian life--the time when they first believed.
   We are not careful to interfere at all with this question, seeing that
   whatever view you take of the expression "from the beginning," the
   great truth developed in the text remains the same. If you shall decide
   that the phrase "from the beginning" is expressive of that eternity
   which preceded all time, you cannot deny the fact that it is plainly
   declared, that they who are chosen are chosen through means of the
   sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the, truth. And you will not
   affirm that the elect were actually sanctified by the Spirit, and did
   actually believe the truth before they came into existence. But you
   will admit that they could not be actually chosen before it was
   possible for them to become the subjects of the sanctification of the
   Spirit and the belief of the truth, for this very obvious reason, that
   it was through means of these that they were chosen, and their
   separation or election actually effected. Should you therefore be of
   opinion that the phrase "from the beginning" is expressive of eternity,
   you are thereby shut up to the admission that the phrase "'chosen to
   salvation" is expressive not of actual election from eternity, but of
   election in purpose, or God's eternal purpose to elect. But the moment
   that you are shut up to this admission, you are shut up thereby to an
   admission of the great truth for which we contend. We contend earnestly
   for the truth, that whatever God does in time he purposed from eternity
   to do. But we contend with equal earnestness for the other truth, that
   election is in no instance a transaction of a bygone eternity, but a
   transaction of God effected in time; and that it is a transaction
   effected in time only, after a sinner believes the gospel, is
   demonstrated by the fact, that it is through the means of the
   sanctification of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth, that any
   sinner is actually, in point of fact, chosen by God.

   You have the same truth brought out by Peter in the verse, from the
   first chapter of his first epistle, which we have also referred to
   before. We have already seen from the examination of that verse that
   the two proximate and subordinate ends which God accomplishes in the
   election of the sinner, are "obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
   Jesus Christ." It is TO these ends that sinners are elected. But the
   verse refers also to the means through which these ends are attained.
   It is expressly said, "through sanctification of the Spirit." We cannot
   conceive of any truth more plainly revealed than this, so that if any
   man shall still deny that election is something which God, in every
   instance, effects through means, we have a right to hold up these plain
   statements of Scripture before him, and to charge him with a
   presumptuous denial of the Word of God. Unless, therefore, a man be
   prepared to rush heedlessly against the thick bosses of the Almighty's
   buckler, and to court the awful "WOE" which rests upon "him who
   striveth with his Maker," and to make the God of truth a liar to his
   face, we cannot conceive how in the face of these plain Bible
   announcements, he can persist in holding by the flagrant absurdity of
   an eternal election, or refuse candidly and honestly to confess that
   election is a transaction of time, effected by God through means of the
   sanctification of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth.

   It is only upon this principle that it is possible for any man
   satisfactorily to explain such a passage as the following:--It is
   written in 2 Peter i. 10, "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
   diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these
   things, ye shall never fall." Now, on the supposition that election is
   an act or purpose of the Divine mind formed from eternity, we defy any
   man to furnish a satisfactory explanation of this verse. On this
   supposition it would amount to little short of blasphemy to call upon
   men to make their election sure or firm. How should any creature be
   called upon to make a decree or act or purpose of the Divine mind sure
   or firm or steadfast? The conception is blasphemous, and it is nowhere
   suggested or countenanced in the Scriptures of truth. We are not
   ignorant of the bungling attempt which is made to explain Away this
   text, and to shade its meaning and eclipse its glory. We are informed,
   for example, that Peter wanted those Christians to whom he wrote to
   make themselves sure of the reality of their calling and election, and
   that there was no uncertainty or doubt hanging over the matter save
   only in their own minds. This explanation is consistent enough with the
   system of error which it is framed to support, but we appeal to every
   unprejudiced and honest man if such an explanation be not a barefaced
   explaining away, an evident perversion, of the inspired words. There is
   no shade of doubt hanging over the translation of the original Greek.
   No scholar has ever ventured to propose, and no man can possibly
   propose a different collocation of the words. The simple term
   translated sure, means nothing else than sure or firm; and Christians
   are therefore called upon to make their calling and election sure. Now,
   you will notice that the Calvinist does not propose a simple
   explanation of the words,--he proposes a complete alteration of their
   evident meaning and import. He denies what the words affirm, and he
   affirms what other passages of Scripture plainly contradict. The words
   affirm the possibility and the duty of Christians to make their calling
   and election firm and sure; but the Calvinist finds it necessary to
   deny the possibility of any man making his calling and election sure,
   in order to maintain the credit of his soul-deluding divinity. Other
   passages of Scripture plainly declare, that the believer in Christ,
   when he is believing, possesses the assurance of his salvation. But the
   Calvinist chooses to write down a contradiction of this truth, and to
   insert his falsehood in place of the other truth which the text we are
   examining evidently contains. This text says nothing at all about
   assurance of salvation as possessed by believers,--it speaks of the
   calling and the election of believers, and it contains an exhortation
   to believers to make their calling and election firm and sure, thereby
   implying, that it is through the instrumentality of means placed by God
   at the Christian's disposal, that their calling and election are in
   point of fact carried into sure and certain execution.

   Look at this text in the clear sunlight of revealed truth, and all is
   beautiful and consistent. Remember that the process of election, or
   separation of believers unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
   Jesus Christ, is carried on by God through means of the sanctification
   of the Spirit and belief of the truth; and in the light of this plainly
   revealed fact, you will at once perceive how believers are called upon
   most consistently to make their calling and election sure. Let it be
   remembered that the calling spoken of here, is the calling to
   glory--that calling which is almost exclusively spoken of in the New
   Testament epistles--that calling which is addressed exclusively to
   believers. Let it be farther remembered, that this high calling to the
   future possession of eternal glory, goes hand in hand, and side by
   side, with the election or separation of the souls of believers from
   the world around them. The call to eternal glory is ever addressed to
   them by God while he carries on the process of election or separation
   of the soul, in all its powers and affections and desires and
   aspirations, from a wicked and ungodly world. The prize of this high
   calling is held out to them at the distance, even while God selects or
   separates them for himself. Now, observe, that the means through which
   this call to glory is addressed to them, are the same as those whereby
   they are chosen or elected or separated in their thoughts and feelings
   and desires and hopes from the vanities of time. It is through
   sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth that they are
   both called to glory, and separated unto obedience and the daily
   sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Here is their calling and
   election, which they are exhorted to make firm and sure. Now, how could
   they do this but by co-operation with God? God it was who addressed to
   them the call to glory, and sought more and more to elect or separate
   them from the world through the sanctification of the Spirit and the
   belief of the truth. But it was their duty to be fellow-workers with
   God--it was their duty to "work out their sanctification with fear and
   trembling," not the less diligently that "God wrought in them both to
   will and to do of his good pleasure." The means whereby God elects or
   separates were all provided and plied by God. The means for the removal
   of that condemnation which stood out as the gigantic hindrance to the
   daily sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ--this consisted in the
   death of Jesus for their sins, and this was provided by God. The means
   for the removal of that unregenerated mind which stood out as the
   gigantic barrier to a course of progressively holy obedience--this
   consisted in the influence of the Holy Spirit, and this also was
   provided by God. The faith of the truth whereby alone the sinner can
   possibly enter into union, and retain increased communion with Jesus,
   and thereby rise from a state of condemnation to a state of
   justification;--the faith of the same truth whereby alone the sinner
   can possibly receive the influence of the Spirit, and thereby become
   the subject of regeneration;--here is another Divinely accredited means
   whereby the calling and election of any man is exhibited and carried
   out into practical execution. Here is the connecting medium between the
   soul of the sinner and the power of God,--the connecting medium between
   the soul of the sinner and that calling and election of which Peter
   speaks, and of which the Bible is full. How then is the believer to
   make his calling and election firm and sure? Clearly by persevering
   steadfastness in the faith of the truth--by holding fast the beginning
   of his confidence steadfast unto the end--by a simple, childlike,
   vigorous reliance on the truth of God, so that faith might grow and
   flourish and expand and produce fruit in abundance, to the praise and
   glory of God.

   You will see, therefore, how it comes to pass that believers are called
   upon to make their calling and election firm and sure. They are
   required to do this because the prize of the high calling at last, and
   their actual separation unto obedience and the daily sprinkling of the
   blood of Jesus Christ--their actual separation to progressive holiness
   here and ultimate glory hereafter, is a process which is carried into
   effect by God through the instrumentality of means; and the means, so
   far as man is concerned, is the faith and obedience of the truth. The
   other means essential to the carrying out of election, or separation
   from the world, were provided by God independently of, and entirely
   without the co-operation or consent of men. The sacrifice of Christ has
   been provided, and the Holy Spirit, is provided, and the truth to be
   believed is provided by God, and placed freely at every sinner's door.
   All things are ready for the immediate election of the sinner. But
   inasmuch as man is a free agent, and is graciously furnished with
   everything necessary to the faith of the truth, it is at this point
   that he is called upon to act his part, and to give credit to the
   testimony of the Spirit who speaks to him of Jesus. Inasmuch,
   therefore, as the faith of the truth is one indispensable means of
   election, the sinner prevents God from electing or separating him from
   the world while he refuses to believe. There is no election out of
   Christ. It is in Christ, as the apostle, to the Ephesians, declares,
   that God hath chosen any sinner, or ever will or ever can choose any
   sinner on the face of the earth. But while the sinner remains
   unconverted--while he remains an unbeliever, he remains out of Christ,
   even as the uningrafted branch: has no connexion with the vine. But
   while you admit that the apostle says that believers are chosen in
   Christ, do you ask what is meant by being chosen in Christ from the
   foundation of the world? In this case, I refer you, in one word, to
   what has been already said. It is election in purpose, or the purpose
   to elect, which was formed from eternity. This purpose was based upon
   God's infallible foreknowledge of the undecreed faith of men. Hence
   Peter says that we are "elect according to the foreknowledge of God."
   But, as we have already said in previous lectures, foreknowledge fixes
   nothing--foreknowledge decrees nothing--foreknowledge leaves the sinner
   as free to act as if nothing were foreknown. But God purposed from
   eternity to give unto you the power to believe, and he purposed
   graciously and earnestly to call upon every one of you to believe, and
   he foreknew with unerring certainty every sinner who will listen to his
   voice, and believe in his Son; and he purposed whenever the sinner
   believes and is united by faith to Christ to elect or separate that
   sinner unto obedience, and the daily sprinkling of the blood of Christ
   on earth, and perfect glory in heaven. The phrase--"chosen in him
   before the foundation of the world," is exactly parallel to the kindred
   phrase--"the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." In both
   instances, the phrase refers to the purpose of God, and the sinner is
   not thereby said to have been actually elected before the foundation of
   the world, any more than Jesus is said to have been actually slain from
   the foundation of the world. You will observe, therefore, that the
   great Bible doctrine of election is uniformly consistent with the
   entire gospel scheme. It hinders no man from salvation. It is the
   sinner's own unbelief which stands out as the only hindrance. The
   doctrine of election invites and entreats and opens up the way, so to
   speak, to every sinner. The means whereby every soul of you may be
   separated, or chosen, or elected by God, are already provided. The Son
   of God has died for your sins. Here, then, is the only ground of
   immediate acceptance--the immediate removal of condemnation. Here is
   the ground on which pardon is freely proclaimed to you all, and on
   which you may instantly be justified. The Holy Spirit is present in his
   blessed influence, and he knocks at the door of every sinner's heart,
   seeking this very night admission into the soul. Here is the agent--the
   blessed agent in regeneration, by whose influence every soul of you may
   this very evening be regenerated. The truth of God respecting Jesus as
   your Saviour--that truth is before you in the inspired volume, the
   letter of love from God to man. Here, then, is the means whereby the
   work of Jesus justifies the soul,--here the means by which the Holy
   Spirit sanctifies. But if you will not credit it when your Bible tells
   you that "God is love," and love to you--if you will still hesitate and
   doubt, and treat God as if he had written down a lie, and sent it down
   to you in the shape of truth--if you will not believe that God is
   satisfied by what his Son did for you on the cross, and fancy
   yourselves not good enough yet to be saved--if you will still persist
   in seeking some qualification within yourselves, as if God were
   inviting the righteous and not sinners to repentance--or if ye will
   remain careless about the revelation of God's love, and count it a
   small thing to be assured that, for Jesus' sake, every sinner in this
   house is this moment as welcome to enjoy his Maker's friendship, as if
   he never had sinned--in one word, if ye will not believe God's truth,
   but will persist in unbelief, you cannot possibly be elected by God.
   But the damnation of your souls will lie for ever at your own doors,
   and your blood will rest eternally and exclusively and justly upon your
   own heads.

   The practical question, after all, resolves itself into this--Will ye
   submit your wills unto God's will so as to become partakers of this
   most blissful and most holy election? There are many who have no
   objections to be elected to safety and to happiness apart from a life
   of active, and laborious, and world-forsaking, and self-denying
   consecration to the service of God and of holiness. Such an election
   has no existence, save in the depraved imaginations of deluded
   Antinomians. "Be not deceived, God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man
   soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth to the flesh, shall of
   the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of
   the Spirit reap life everlasting." "Without holiness, no man shall see
   the Lord." The choice, then, is before you. We dare not bribe you into
   the church of the living God, by concealing from you the fact, that
   there is no salvation for any man disconnected from holiness of heart
   and holiness of life. Be it known unto you, men and brethren, that
   holiness of heart and holiness of life, is itself salvation. It is not
   the ground of salvation. No. The finished work of Jesus for your sins;
   that is the only foundation or ground of any solid hope for time or for
   eternity. It is not even the means of salvation. No.--Simple faith in
   Christ as your Saviour; that is the one only means whereby any soul can
   possibly come into the possession of the great salvation. But since
   holiness is not the ground or foundation on which a man may stand and
   apprehend salvation as all his own; and since it is not even the means
   through which a man may ultimately reach it, does any man inquire--What
   is the use for holiness? Our answer to such an inquirer is--"Holiness
   is salvation." We do not say, indeed, that holiness is the first or
   preliminary stage, so to speak, of any man's salvation. We say the very
   reverse, when we contend earnestly against the universally prevalent
   delusion, that the sinner must needs be holy first, or that the sinner
   can possibly be holy first, before he is in a pardoned state, and in a
   position to know that he is pardoned and justified and saved from
   impending wrath. No sinner can possibly enter upon the path of holy
   obedience, until he knows assuredly that his sins are freely pardoned.
   Holiness, therefore, is not needed, either to render it consistent with
   God to pardon your sins, or to assure any sinner that his sins are
   pardoned. The assurance of pardon must needs precede and anticipate any
   and every holy emotion within the soul, and any and every holy action
   in the life so that if you have never known the blessedness of "the man
   whose iniquities are pardoned, whose sins are covered, and to whom the
   Lord imputeth not iniquity,"--which blessedness arises from a conscious
   sense or assurance of forgiving mercy;--if you are still the subjects
   of doubts and fears upon this great preliminary step in the experience
   of every child of God, you need no other or stronger evidence to
   convince you that you are "still in the gall of bitterness and in the
   bond of iniquity." But it is equally true, my brother, that if you are
   assuring your soul of a free forgiveness, and talking of "peace with
   God," and entertaining the hope of future blessedness, while you still
   retain the consciousness within your bosom, that (though men who see
   not into the heart, treat you as one of God's children), you are not
   loving Jesus Christ because he has already saved you from condemnation,
   and because you know, and rejoice in knowing, that he saves his people,
   not only from condemnation, but "from their sins;"--if having the
   consciousness of an imaginary justification through his blood, you lack
   the consciousness of a sincere desire and earnest readiness to
   sacrifice all that is dear to flesh and blood, in order to be
   assimilated to his blessed image;--Wif there is one solitary object on
   earth, or one solitary lust of the flesh, which you are not ready to
   sacrifice at the bidding of Jesus Christ;--you may, indeed, pass
   current among men for a child of God, but in the eye of God, and in the
   light of God's truth, you stand out a self-convicted hypocrite. The
   sooner you flee to Christ, the better for your poor soul. You are
   deceiving yourself, if you think you are safe for eternity. You are
   wilfully shutting your eyes against the salvation of the gospel. You
   are assuredly turning the grace of God into licentiousness, and making
   Christ the minister of sin. "If any man come after me, and hate not
   father and mother, and houses and lands, yea and his own life also, he
   cannot be my disciple." You must make an absolute and unconditional
   surrender of your own depraved will to God's will, before you are even
   in a position to apprehend clearly the blessed message which brings to
   your door a free salvation. You have not yet apprehended the light--the
   true light shining around you. What is the reason? Why do you not
   receive Christ's salvation, but choose rather to soothe your soul by a
   false and presumptuous assurance of safety? Yours is not the assurance
   which the people of God, in every age, have every one of them
   possessed. Yours is the assurance of presumption. It has not led you to
   surrender all to the disposal of your God. There is some favourite idol
   still within your soul. You may be looking with pity upon those around
   you who make an idol of a minister, or a church, or a man-made creed,
   whereby they are prevented from opening their eyes upon the glorious
   gospel; but "why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
   and seest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first
   cast out the beam that is in thine own eye, and then shalt thou see
   clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother's eye." Thou
   speakest truly enough when thou sayest that an unscriptural creed
   prevents many from looking at the truth; but this is only one form of
   the delusion whereby Satan deceives and retains within his grasp the
   souls of men. What if thy neighbour loves his creed, or his religious
   sect, or party orthodoxy, more than Christ, while you love some other
   object more than Christ? What that object is, I know not; but God
   knoweth, and thine own conscience will reveal it unto thee, if thou
   wilt but listen to her faithful voice. I again press the question, Why
   do you not receive Christ's salvation? What is the reason of your
   remaining unbelief as to this, while it may be you are consoling
   yourself under the assurance of a pardon which God has nowhere
   revealed, and which it is impossible for God to grant to any being in
   the wide universe--a pardon disconnected from holiness? Hear our
   Saviour's infallible reply: "This is the condemnation, that light has
   come into the world, and men love the darkness rather than the light
   because their deeds are evil." John iii. 19. "Their deeds are evil."
   Such is the reason why they love the darkness and will not open their
   eyes upon "the true light"--the light which unfolds the salvation of
   the gospel--the light which shows all who will look upon it, that the
   salvation of the gospel is a salvation from all sin as well as from
   merited punishment. "Their deeds are evil." Some men see at a glance
   that if they were to be at peace with God, they would need to part with
   some questionable or, it may be, positively sinful occupation--others
   suspect at once that if they were to be friends with God and to enjoy
   assurance of salvation, they would incur the displeasure and be made
   the laughing-stock of their unconverted friends. They want a religion
   which will keep their consciences at ease, while they retain their
   sinful occupation, or keep up their intercourse with their most
   agreeable companions, and so they love the darkness--they choose rather
   to retain a human error which instructs them to suspend assurance upon
   future procrastinated amendment, and to shut their eyes against the
   light of gospel truth, which would bring them to immediate and perfect
   peace, but which would also dissociate them from what they love. But
   many more there are whose "deeds are evil," and they would retain their
   sins and be excused from "denying themselves and taking up their
   cross;" and so they separate in their minds between safety and holy
   living, and they shut their eyes against the light which reveals the
   only pardon of the gospel--the pardon with self-denial, and active,
   laborious, flesh-crucifying, and world-sacrificing holiness, beneath
   and behind it. And so they learn to speak of peace with God and
   assurance of a possessed and enjoyed salvation--deceiving and being
   deceived! The last error is worse--infinitely worse, because. more
   dangerous, than the first. We would not therefore deceive you. We would
   rather inform you plainly, that unless you have made up your minds to
   sacrifice whatever you may discover to be inconsistent with the will of
   God, and to do whatever God shall require you to do, though it should
   be at much painful cost and sacrifice to flesh and blood, you cannot
   possibly be Christ's disciples. There is a free pardon for every soul
   of you in Christ, and that even now. But the enjoyment of this gracious
   forgiveness is only preliminary to a life of progressive holiness on
   earth, and an eternity of holiness beyond the grave. It is for you,
   beloved friends, to make your choice. I know full well that, at this
   moment, every feeling of your souls, and every association of your
   thoughts, and every habit of your lives, and every impulse of your
   desires, and, it may be, every apparent temporal interest with which
   you are bound up, chime in with the syren song of a false and
   destructive orthodoxy, which bears onward impetuously against the truth
   of God, inducing you to close your eyes against the light of life, and
   your understandings against the candid and serious examination of the
   gospel of salvation. Of this I am not ignorant; but you are not left
   without an opposing influence which would lead you to Jesus, and to
   true and lasting happiness. And with this better influence bearing upon
   your minds, and soliciting your instant decision on the side of God,
   you have the power to resist all that infernal influence whereby you
   are led astray, and this instant to choose "the good part which shall
   never be taken from you." God the Father pleads with you; God the Son
   pleads with you; God the Spirit pleads with you. The interests of
   eternity are set against the selfish and mistaken interests of time;
   and you are asked by God himself to say, "What is a man profited,
   though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" And you have the
   power to decide for God and for happiness in opposition to every
   allurement which seeks to enchant you, and which beckons you downward
   to destruction. You have the power to will or to choose the good rather
   than the evil, even now while the current of evil is bearing you
   impetuously along on its dark and troubled bosom. You have not yet
   reached the farthest verge over which many a deluded soul is carried,
   and plunged into the deep unfathomable abyss beneath, from which there
   is no escape. You have the power to choose, as we have endeavoured in
   former addresses to demonstrate in your hearing. It is for you to
   consider the freeness of that salvation which is announced to you, and
   to look well at its nature as a salvation from condemnation this very
   moment, in order to subsequent and entire consecration of all that you
   are, and all that you have, to the service of your God. You have the
   power to make it this very moment entirely and everlastingly your own,
   in fullest and most blissful possession; but you have the power to
   decide against it and to rush upon perdition. There cannot be any other
   alternative; FOR it or AGAINST it, you must this night, every soul of
   you decide. Hesitancy and doubt, and procrastination till some more
   convenient season--these are present determinations of your will
   against salvation. Before you is the blessing and the curse!--both are
   before you. The claims of God and the sinful allurements of the
   flesh!--both are before you. An open heaven and a gaping hell!--both
   are before you. Heavenly truth exhibited by the Holy Spirit as the
   guide-mark to glory, and hellish error exhibited by Satan, in the shape
   of an angel of light, to allure you to everlasting woe--both are before
   you. No power in the universe can constrain your choice. God himself
   cannot FORCE you to choose--the decision is in your own hands. "Choose
   ye this day whom ye will serve. If Jehovah be God, serve him; but if
   Baal be God, serve him."

APPENDIX.

   WE have quoted, in pages 100 and 112, from the work of Zanchius in
   defence of Calvinism, translated by Toplady, in order to establish what
   many blind and ignorant Calvinists of the present day endeavour to
   deny--the identity of Calvinism with the FATALISM of the ancients. We
   here subjoin what Toplady himself published, and what the late Dr.
   Pringle of Perth republished, in the way, not of DENYING (for it cannot
   truthfully be denied), but of explaining and defending, after pleading
   guilty to the charge. Our readers will be pleased to mark the absence
   of all reference to the Word of God, and the barefaced appeal made by
   CHRISTIAN MEN to HEATHEN AND ANTICHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHERS in support of
   this theology! If the supporters of this system could discover in the
   Bible any foundation for their creed, would they be foolish enough to
   make their appeal to a document like the following? But we cheerfully
   give them the benefit of the best defence of their system they can
   find, and here append the entire document, It is intituled

   AN APPENDIX concerning the FATE OF THE ANCIENTS, From the Latin of
   JUSTUS LIPSIUS. [7]

   Fate [says Apuleins] according to Plato, is that, "Per quod,
   inevitabiles cogitationes Dei atque incepta complentur" whereby the
   purposes and designs of God are accomplished. Hence, the Platonics
   considered Providence under a threefold distinction: 1 The Providentia
   prima, or that which gave birth to all effects and is defined by them
   to be, tou protou Theou noesis, the intention or will of the Supreme
   GOD. 2. The Providentia secunda, or actual agency of the secondary or
   inferior beings, who were supposed to pervade tile heavens, and, from
   thence, by their influence, to regulate and dispose of all sublunary
   things; and, especially, to prevent the extinction of any one species
   below. 3. The Providentia tertia, supposed to be exerted by the Genii;
   whose office it was, to exercise a particular care over mankind: to
   guard our persons, and direct our actions.

   But the STOICAL view of Providence, or Fate, was abundantly more
   simple, and required no such nicety of distinction. These philosophers
   did, at once, derive all the chain of causes and effects from their
   true and undoubted source, the WILL of the ONE LIVING AND TRUE GOD.
   Hence, with these Sages, the words DEITY, FATE, PROVIDENCE, were
   frequently reciprocated as terms synonymous. Thus Seneca, speaking of
   God; "Will you call him Fate? You will call him rightly: for all things
   are suspended on him. Himself is causa causarum, the cause of causes
   beside." The laws of the universe are from God; whence the same
   philosopher, elsewhere, observes, "Omnia certa et in aeternum dicta
   lege decurrere:" All things go on, according to a certain rule or
   decree ordained for ever: meaning in the law of Fate. So Cicero: "All
   things come to pass, according to the sovereignty of the eternal law."
   And Pindar, probably, had an eye to this, where he says, Nomon panton
   Basilea, thanaton te kai athaaton, einai. That The law ruleth all,
   whether gods or mortals. Manlius most certainly had:

   Sed nihil in tota magis est mirabile mole.

   Quam RATIO et certes quod LEGIBUS omnia parent. Where by Ratio, is
   evidently meant, the decreeing mind of God; and by Leges, is meant
   Fate, or that series of causes and effects which is the offspring of
   his decree.

   Homer cannot begin his Iliad, without asserting this grand truth: Dios
   o eteleieto bele: the counsel or decree of Jupiter was fulfilled. The
   divine poet sets out on this exalted principle; he puts it in the front
   of the noblest poem in the world, as a testimony both of his wisdom and
   his faith. It was as if he had said, "I shall sing of numberless
   events, equally grand, entertaining and important; but I cannot begin
   to unfold them without laying down THIS, as a first, fundamental axiom,
   That, though brought to pass by the instrumental agency of men, they
   were the fruit of God's determining Will, and of his all-directing
   Providence."

   Neither are those minuter events, which seemingly are the result of
   chance, excluded from this law: even these do not happen, but come to
   pass in a regular order of succession, and at their due period of time.
   "Causa pendet ex causa: privata ac publica longus ordo rerum trahit,"
   says Seneca: "Cause proceeds from cause; the long train of things draws
   with it all events, both public and private." Excellent is that of
   Sophocles; (Aj. Flagell.)

     Ego men oun kai tauta, kai ta tant' aei,
     Phaskoim' an anthropoisi mechanan Theous.
     Hoto dei me to d' estin en gnome phila.
     Keinos ekeina stergeto; kago tade.

   i. e. "I am firmly of opinion, that all these things, and whatever else
   befall us, are in consequence of the Divine purpose: whoso thinks
   otherwise, is at liberty to follow his own judgment; but this will ever
   be mine."

   The Longus ordo rerum, mentioned by Seneca, is what he elsewhere
   styles, "Causarun implex series," or a perpetual implication of causes.
   This, according to Laertius, was called by the Stoics, aitia ton onton
   eiromene, an involved, or concatenate causality of whatever has any
   existence: for, eirmos is a chain, or implicate connexion. Agreeably to
   this idea, Chrysippus gives the following definition of Fate:
   Eimarmenen einai, phusiken suntaxin ton holon ex aidiou, ton heteron
   tois heterois epakalouthounton, ametabolou kai aparabatou ouses tes
   poiautes sumplokes. "Fate is that natural, established order and
   constitution of all things, from everlasting, whereby they mutually
   follow upon each other, in consequence of an immutable and perpetual
   complication."

   Let us examine this celebrated definition of Fate. 1. He calls it a
   natural suntaxis: meaning by nature, the great Natura Prima, or GOD,
   for, by some Stoics, GOD and NATURE are used promiscuously. But,
   because the Deity must be supposed both to decree and to act with
   wisdom, intelligence, and design, FATE is sometimes mentioned by them
   under the name of logos, or Reason. Thus they define FATE (Laert. in
   Zen.) heimarmenen, logou, kath' hon okosmos diexagetai, to be that
   supreme "Reason, whereby the world is governed and directed;" or, more
   minutely thus, logon, kath' hon ota men gegonota gegone, ta de legomena
   ginetai, ta de genesomena genesetai: "that reason, whereby things that
   have been, were: the things that now are, have a present existence: and
   the things that are to be, shall be. Reason, you see, or Wisdom, in the
   DEITY, is an antecedent cause, from whence both Providence and inferior
   Nature are derived. It is added in Stobaeus, metalambanei de tou logou,
   ten aletheian, ten aitian, ten phisin, ten ananken, i. e. that
   Chrysippus sometimes varies his terms; and, instead of the word reason,
   substitutes the words truth, cause, nature, necessity; intimating, that
   Fate is the true, natural, necessary cause of the things that are, and
   of the manner in which they are.--2. This FATE is said to be ex aidou
   from everlasting. Nor improperly: since the constitution of things was
   settled and fixed in the Divine mind (where they had a sort of ideal
   existence) previous to their actual creation: and therefore, considered
   as certainly future in his decree, may be said to have been, in some
   sense, co-eternal with himself.--3. The immutable and perpetual
   complication, mentioned in the definition, means no more than that
   reciprocal involution of causes and effects, positis omnibus ponendis,
   are necessarily produced, according to the plan which infinite wisdom
   designed from the beginning. GOD, the First Cause, hath given being and
   activity to an immense number of secondary, subaltern causes; which are
   so inseparably linked and interwoven with their respective effects (a
   connexion truly admirable, and not to be comprehended by man in his
   present state), that those things which do in reality come to pass
   necessarily, and by inevitable destiny; seem, to the superficial
   observer, to come to pass in the common course of nature, or by virtue
   of human reasoning and freedom. This is that inscrutable method of
   Divine wisdom, "A qua" (says St. Austin) "est omnis modus, omnis
   species, omnnis ordo, mensura, numerus, pondus; a qua sunt semina
   formarum, formae seminum, motus feminum atque formarum."

   NECESSITY is the consequence of Fate. So TRISMEGISTUS: Panta de
   gignetai phusei kai heimarmene, kai ouk esti topos eremos pronoias,
   pronoia de esti, autoteles logos tou epouraniou Theou. Duo de toutou
   auto phueis dunameis ananke kai heimarmene: i. e. "All things are
   brought about by Nature and by Fate; neither is any place void of
   Providence. Now, Providence is the self-perfect reason of the
   super-celestial God; from which reason of his, issue two native powers,
   Necessity and Fate." Thus, in the judgment of the wiser heathens,
   effects were to be traced up to their producing causes; those producing
   causes were to be farther traced up to the still higher causes by which
   they were produced; and those higher causes to GOD, the cause of them.
   Persons, things, circumstances, events, and consequences are the
   effects of necessity; Necessity is the daughter of Fate: Fate is the
   offspring of God's infinite wisdom and sovereign WILL. Thus, all things
   are ultimately resolved into their Great Primary Cause; by whom the
   chain was originally let down from heaven, and on whom every link
   depends.

   It must be owned, that all the fatalists of antiquity (particularly
   among the Stoics) did not constantly express themselves with due
   precision. A Christian, who is savingly taught by the Word and Spirit
   of God, must be pained and disgusted, not to say, shocked, when he
   reads such an assertion as Ten peprmenen moiran adunaton esti
   apophugein kai Theo. God himself cannot possibly avoid his destiny
   (Herodot. 1.), or that of the poet Philemon:

   douloi basileon eisin, di basileis Theon,
   Ho Theos anankes.

   Common men are servants to kings; kings are servants to the gods; and
   God is a servant to necessity. So Seneca: "Eadem necessitas et Deos
   alligat: irrevocabilis Divina pariter atque humana cursus vehit. Ille
   ipse, omnium conditor ac rector, scripsit quidem Fata, sed sequitur.
   Semper paret: Semel jussit." "The self-same necessity binds the gods
   themselves. All things, divine as well as human, are carried forward by
   one identical and overpowering rapidity. The supreme Author and
   Governor of the universe hath, indeed, written and ordained the Fates;
   but, having once ordained them, he ever after obeys them. He commanded
   them at first, for once: but his conformity to them is perpetual." This
   is, without doubt, very irreverently, and very incautiously
   expressed--whence it has been common with many Christian writers, to
   tax the Stoics with setting up a First Cause superior to God himself,
   and on which he is dependent.

   But, I apprehend, these philosophers meant, in reality, no such thing.
   All they designed to inculcate was, that the WILL of God and his
   Decrees are unchangeable: that there can be no alteration in the Divine
   intention; no new act arise in his MIND; no reversion of his eternal
   plan; all being founded in adorable Sovereignty; ordered by infallible
   Wisdom; ratified by Omnipotence; and cemented with Immutability. Thus
   Lucan:

   Finxit in aeternum causas; qua cuncta coercet,
   Se quoque lege tenens.

   And this, not through any imbecility in God, or as if he was subject to
   Fate, of which (on the contrary) himself was the ordainer: but because
   it is his pleasure to abide by his own decree. For, as Seneca observes,
   "Imminutio majestatis sit, et confessio erroris, mutanda fecisse.
   Necesse est ei eadem placere, cui nisi optima placere non possunt:" "It
   would detract from the greatness of God, and look as if he acknowledged
   himself liable to mistakes, was he to make changeable decrees: his
   pleasure must necessarily be always the same; seeing, that only which
   is best can at any time please an all-perfect being. A good man (adds
   this philosopher) is under a kind of pleasing necessity to do good;
   and, if he did not do it, he could not be a good man."

   "Magnum hoc argumentum est firmae voluntatis, ne mutare quidem posse:"
   "It is a striking proof of a magnanimous will, to be absolutely
   incapable of changing." And such is the will of God--it never
   fluctuates nor varies. But, on the other hand, was he susceptible of
   change; could he, through the intervention of any inferior cause, or by
   some untoward combination of external circumstances, be induced to
   recede from his purpose and alter his plan; it would be a most
   incontestable mark of weakness and dependence: the force of which
   argument made Seneca, though a heathen, cry out, "Non externa Deos
   cogunt; sed sua illis in legem aeterna voluntas est:" "Outward things
   cannot compel the gods; but their own eternal will is a law to
   themselves." It may be observed, that this seems to infer, as if the
   Deity was still under some kind of restaint. By no means. Let Seneca
   obviate this cavil, as he effectually does, in these admirable words:
   "Nec Deus ab hoc minus liber aut potens est; IPSE ENIM EST NECESSITAS
   SUA:" "God is not hereby, either less free or less powerful; FOR HE
   HIMSELF IS HIS OWN NECESSITY."

   On the whole, it is evident, that when the Stoics speak, even in the
   strongest terms, of the obligation of Fate on God himself, they may,
   and ought to be understood, in a sense worthy of the Adorable Uncreated
   Majesty. In thus interpreting the doctrine of Fate, as taught by the
   genuine philosophers of the Portico, I have the great St. Austin on my
   side: who, after canvassing and justly rejecting the bastard, or
   astrological Fate, thus goes on: "At qui omnium connectionem seriemque
   causarum, qua fit omne quod fit, Fati nomine appellant; non multum cum
   eis, de verbi controversia, certandum atque laborandum est:
   quandoquidem ipsum causarum ordinem, et quandam connectionem, SUMMI DEI
   tribuunt VOLUNTATI:" i. e. "But for those philosophers [meaning the
   STOICS] who, by the word Fate, mean that regular chain and series of
   causes to which all things that come to pass owe their immediate
   existence; we will not earnestly contend with these persons, about a
   mere term: and we the rather acquiesce in their manner of expression,
   because they carefully ascribe--this fixed succession of things, and
   this mutual concatenation of causes and effects, to the WILL of the
   SUPREME GOD." Austin adds many observations of the same import, and
   proves, from Seneca himself, as rigid a Stoic as any, that this was the
   doctrine and the meaning of his philosophic brethren.

  THE END.
